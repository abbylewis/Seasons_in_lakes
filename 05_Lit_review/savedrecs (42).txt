The main objective of the ongoing research is to illustrate how environmental factors, such as the concentrations of abiotic components including pollutants in the water of drains, fish farms, treatment stations and Lake Burullus, affect the distribution and classification of phytoplankton populations. Samples of surface water were taken during spring 2020 at ten sites that represented four ecological locations to identify the algae and analyze. The microalgae species were recognized morphologically via light microscopic characterization. Thirty-eight phytoplankton species were found and identified in different locations representing four Bacillariophytes, nine Chlorophytes, and twenty-five Cyanophytes. Oscillatoria contributed the most, followed by Anabaena, and Chroococcus. Scenedesmus bijuga and Chlorella vulgaris. Besides, the largest number of colonies was observed in Lake Burullus, followed by pump stations, fish farms, and drains. Using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), it was recognized that 4 groups (communities) were segregated at the 4(th) classification level. Total algal richness exhibited a positively significant linkwith NH3 and PO4, but a negatively significant correlation with TDS, EC, Zn, and Cd. The richness of Chlorophyta exhibited a negative correlation with Fe, while the richness of Cyanophyta exhibited a strong positive correlation with PO4 and a negative correlation with zinc. However, there are notable differences in TDS, NH3, and zinc between the water from various places. The greatest values of water pH, TDS, EC, COD, and heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Cd) were found in Lake Burullus. Conversely, the drains showed the greatest levels of NH3 and DO and the lowest levels of nearly all water variables. The present study concluded that abiotic components showed a direct relationship in distributing the microalgae, where ammonia, phosphate, iron, Zinc, cadmium, TDS and EC exhibited influence on algal abundance.

In Belgium, brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) was introduced decades ago, and is already established and widespread. Here, we report the first occurrence of a congeneric non-native invasive bullhead species in Belgium, the black bullhead (Ameiurus melas). In early May 2023, electric fishing in the Zonderikbeek, a stream situated in the northeast of Flanders (Northern region of Belgium), led the capture of a suspicious bullhead specimen. Diagnostic PCR analysis identified this specimen as a hybrid between black and brown bullheads. The following spring, in 2024, 21 Ameiurus specimens were additionally captured in a nearby lake that connected to the Zonderikbeek. Diagnostic PCR revealed that 17 of the captured individuals were pure black bullheads, three were pure brown bullheads, and one specimen appeared to be a hybrid. Morphological examination of the main distinguishing key features of these bullhead species, such as the pigmentation the anal and caudal fin membrane, gill-raker count, and the serration of the pectoral spine, were in line with these molecular analyses. Notably, hybrid individuals were morphologically characterized with features of both A. melas and A. nebulosus. The discovery of multiple individuals of A. melas, along with hybrids with the already established A. nebulosus is concerning especially given the extensive network lakes, creeks, and small rivers in vicinity of these observations. This interconnected system of water bodies could facilitate the further dispersal of both species and their hybrids. Given the significant potential ecological and socio-economic impacts of both species, urgent management efforts are needed to remove or contain not only the brown bullhead, but also the black bullhead as emerging non-native invasive species in Belgium.

J	Beklioglu, M; Ince, O; Tuzun, I				Beklioglu, M; Ince, O; Tuzun, I			Restoration of the eutrophic Lake Eymir, Turkey, by biomanipulation after a major external nutrient control I	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient loading in lakes is recognized as a serious threat to water quality. Over 25 years of raw sewage effluent discharge shifted Lake Eymir from a state dominated by submerged plants to a turbid water state. Successful effluent diversion undertaken in 1995 achieved 88% and 95% reductions in the areal loading of total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), respectively. Furthermore, the reduced load of TP was very close to the suggested threshold areal load (0.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)) to attain recovery. Even though diversion also reduced the in-lake TP level by half, the poor water clarity and low submerged plant coverage (112 +/- 43 cm and 2.5% coverage of the lake total surface area, respectively) persisted. Domination of the fish stock by planktivorous tench (Tinca tinca L.) and the benthivorous common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) (66 +/- 0.7 and 31 +/- 1 kg CPUE, respectively) appeared to perpetuate the poor water condition. A substantial fish removal effort over 1 year achieved a 57% reduction in the fish stock which led to a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disk transparency. This increase occurred largely because of a 4.5-fold decrease in the inorganic suspended solid concentration, and to some extent, a decrease in chlorophyll-a concentration. A strong top-down effect of fish on the large-sized grazers was evident as density and the body size of Daphnia pulex de Geer increased significantly after the fish removal. Even though the spring and annual euphotic depths occurred well above the maximum and mean depths of the lake, respectively, re-development of submerged plants was poor (6.2% coverage). A weak re-establishment of submerged plants might be attributed to an insufficiently viable seed bank, inappropriate chemical conditions of the sediment (severe oxygen deficiency), or to the high coot (Fulica atra L.) density. However, the top-down effect of fish appeared to be of great importance in determining water clarity, and in turn, conditions for submerged plant development in a warm temperate lake as recorded in the north temperate lakes. Furthermore, this study provides evidence for the importance of top-down control of fish, which, in turn, can be effectively utilised as a restoration strategy in warm-temperate lakes as well. More applications, along with long monitoring programs, are needed to develop a better understanding about requirements for biomanipulation success in this climate.					beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2003	490	1-3					93	105		10.1023/A:1023466629489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023466629489													WOS:000182463800009
J	De Billy, VD; Dumont, B; Lagarrigue, T; Baran, P; Statzner, B				De Billy, VD; Dumont, B; Lagarrigue, T; Baran, P; Statzner, B			Invertebrate accessibility and vulnerability in the analysis of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) summer habitat suitability	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Water discharge regulation can affect food availability, accessibility and vulnerability and thus, the trophic habitat suitability for lotic salmonids. To analyse brown trout habitat suitability, we therefore combined the relative importance of the food availability (overall abundance of benthic and drifting invertebrates), with the potential food vulnerability (accessibility, conspicuousness and ease of handling), the latter depending on both physical habitat characteristics (flow patterns and structural complexity of habitat) and invertebrate traits (size and other biological traits). We considered the trophic patterns of trout at two spatial scales: the reach scale (unregulated reach versus regulated reach) and the macrohabitat scale (e.g. riffles and pools). Discharge regulation reduced trout abundance, biomass, and temperature-independent growth rates. In the regulated reach, trout had a lower total prey consumption, a higher consumption of terrestrial There were no macrohabitat-specific differences in the total prey consumption and in the potential food availability within each reach. However, brown trout diets differed between the macrohabitats of each reach, in relation to differences in potential invertebrate vulnerability, invertebrates and a higher diet diversity than in the unregulated reach, indicating that trout were food-limited. However, the potential availability of food supplies per individual trout was similar for the two reaches. Thus, trout prey consumption in the regulated reach should have been predominantly affected by the decrease in both the availability of large invertebrates in the drift and their vulnerability in the total food supplies. There were no macrohabitat-specific differences in the total prey consumption and in the potential food availability within each reach. However, brown trout diets differed between the macrohabitats of each reach, in relation to differences in potential invertebrate vulnerability. Therefore, the potential vulnerability of invertebrates to predation was more relevant in the ecological evaluation of salmonid habitat suitability than the total food availability. The analysis at the macrohabitat scale provided a better understanding of the switches in brown trout diet and enabled a finer and more realistic analysis of trout feeding patterns.

J	Yu, JQ; Kelts, KR				Yu, JQ; Kelts, KR			Abrupt changes in climatic conditions across the late-glacial/Holocene transition on the N. E. Tibet-Qinghai Plateau: evidence from Lake Qinghai, China	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A multi-proxy investigation of two sediment cores from the large closed-basin Lake Qinghai provides evidence of abrupt changes in paleolimnological conditions across the late-glacial/Holocene transition. The chronology of the lacustrine sediment sequence is framed by four AMS C-14 ages for aquatic-plant macrofossil seeds. Four distinct stratigraphic units are identified on the basis of abrupt shifts in lithology, carbonate composition, delta(18)O of authigenic carbonates, magnetic susceptibility characteristics, and total nitrogen content. These units represent four environmental stages that were each initiated by three abrupt changes in hydro-climatic regime at similar to11,600, 10,700, and 10,000 C-14 yrs B. P. Each of the four environmental stages thus represents a characteristic precipitation-to-evaporation balance for the lake catchment. The paleoenvironmental evidence indicates that the lake before 11,600 C-14 yrs B. P. was very shallow with carbonate production and organic productivity much lower than in the Holocene, suggesting a much colder and drier climate than in the Holocene. From similar to11,600 to 10,700 C-14 yrs B. P., the presence of clastic laminations and Ruppia fossil seeds suggests an increased inflow of sediment-laden waters into the lake. Between similar to10,700 and 10,000 C-14 yrs B. P., the development of a carbonate playa lake indicates that a negative water balance persisted. From similar to10,000 C-14 yrs B. P. an abrupt increase in rainfall is suggested by a sudden termination of the playa lake environment and the diluted lake waters, as evidenced by negative shift in both total carbonate content and delta(14)O values of mineral carbonate. However, the lake level during the early Holocene was about 20 m shallower than today, indicating that the effective moisture then was much lower than it is today. The multi-proxy record suggests a step-wise pattern of climatic change across the late-glacial/Holocene transition along with abrupt shifts in P-E balance on the N. E. Tibet-Qinghai Plateau. This pattern is characterized by reorganization of Asian monsoon circulation, which probably was determined by increasing summer insolation and changes in surface boundary conditions accompanying regional deglaciation. The arid event at similar to10,700-10,000 C-14 yrs B. P. is interpreted as a Younger Dryas equivalent, although climatic cooling is not indicated by the evidence at hand.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2002	28	2					195	206		10.1023/A:1021635715857	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021635715857													WOS:000179614800002
J	Connallon, CB; Schaetzl, RJ				Connallon, Christopher B.; Schaetzl, Randall J.			Geomorphology of the Chippewa River delta of Glacial Lake Saginaw, central Lower Michigan, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												We introduce, characterize, and interpret the geomorphic history of a relict, Pleistocene-aged delta of the Chippewa River in central Lower Michigan. The broad, sandy Chippewa delta developed into various stages of Glacial Lake Saginaw, between ca.approximate to 17 and 15 ka BP (calibrated ages). Although the delta was first identified in 1955 on a statewide glacial geology map, neither its extent nor its Pleistocene history had been previously determined. The delta is typically forested, owing to its wet, sandy soils, which stand out against the, agricultural fields of the surrounding, loamy lake plain sediments. The delta heads near the city of Mt Pleasant and extends eastward onto the Saginaw Lowlands, i.e., the plain of Glacial Lake Saginaw. Data from 3285 water well logs, 180 hand augered sites, and 185 points randomly located in a GIS on two-storied (sand over loam) soils were used to determine the extent, textural properties, and thickness of the delta. The delta is approximate to 18 km wide and approximate to 38 km long and is sandy throughout. Deltaic sediments from neighboring rivers that also drained into Glacial Lake Saginaw merge with the lower Chippewa delta, obscuring its boundary there. The delta is thickest near the delta's head and in the center, but thins to 1-2 m or less on its eastern margins. Mean thicknesses are 2.3-2.9 m, suggestive of a thin sediment body, frequently impacted by the waves and fluctuating waters of the lakes. Although beach ridges are only weakly expressed across the delta because of the sandy sediment, the coarsest parts of the delta are generally coincident with some of these inferred former shorezones and have a broad, incised channel that formed while lake levels were low. The thick upper delta generally lies above the relict shorelines of Glacial Lakes Saginaw and Arkona (approximate to 17.1 to approximate to 16 ka BP), whereas most of the thin, distal delta is associated with Glacial Lake Warren (approximate to 15 ka BP). Together, these data suggest that the Chippewa delta formed and prograded as lake levels in the Saginaw Lowlands alternated and episodically fell. The result is a delta that is comparatively thin, expansive, and sandy. In some places, these sands have subsequently been reworked into fields of small parabolic dunes.

The mid-Miocene Black Mountains accommodation zone of southern Nevada and western Arizona is a well-exposed example of an accommodation zone linking two regionally extensive and opposing tilt domains. In the southeastern part of this zone near Kingman, Arizona, east dipping normal faults of the Whipple tilt domain and west dipping normal faults of the Lake Mead domain coalesce across a relatively narrow region characterized by a series of linked, extensional folds. The geometry of these folds in this strike-parallel portion of the accommodation zone is dictated by the geometry of the interdigitating normal faults of opposed polarity. Synclines formed where normal faults of opposite polarity face away from each other whereas anticlines formed where the opposed normal faults face each other. Opposed normal faults with small overlaps produced short folds with axial trends at significant angles to regional strike directions, whereas large fault overlaps produce elongate folds parallel to faults. Analysis of faults shows that the folds are purely extensional and result from east/northeast stretching and fault-related tilting. The structural geometry of this portion of the accommodation zone mirrors that of the Black Mountains accommodation zone more regionally, with both transverse and strike-parallel antithetic segments. Normal faults of both tilt domains lose displacement and terminate within the<LF>accommodation zone northwest of Kingman, Arizona. However, isotopic dating of growth sequences and crosscutting relationships show that the initiation of the two fault systems in this area was not entirely synchronous and that west dipping faults of the Lake Mead domain began to form between 1 m.y. to 0.2 m.y. prior to east dipping faults of the Whipple domain. The accommodation zone formed above an active and evolving magmatic center that, prior to rifting, produced intermediate-composition volcanic rocks and that, during rifting, produced voluminous rhyolite and basalt magmas.																			0278-7407					FEB 25	2004	23	1							TC1019	10.1029/2002TC001454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002TC001454													WOS:000220219900001

Distribution of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in the nearshore fish community of the St. Lawrence River	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Objective We investigated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus dynamics in wild fish populations of the St. Lawrence River to compare host competency among five abundant native species and the invasive Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus following two decades of host-pathogen coevolution. To examine species' responses to the virus and identify principal hosts as viral reservoir species, we used viral surveillance among Round Gobies, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, Rock Bass Ambloplites rupestris, Pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, Bluegill L. macrochirus, and Brown Bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus collected from the nearshore fish community in the upper St. Lawrence River during spring 2020-2021.Methods Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR was used to detect and quantify viral nucleoprotein gene genetic material in pooled organ (i.e., liver, kidney, and spleen) and brain tissues of wild fish belonging to several susceptible host species.Results Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR detected viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus genetic material in each species during both sampling years. There was significant variation between species in both infection prevalence and median viral titer. Invasive Round Gobies exhibited significantly higher prevalence and titers compared to any of the native species. However, some native fishes (e.g., Yellow Perch and sunfishes Lepomis spp.) presented higher infection prevalence and viral concentrations compared to the others (e.g., Rock Bass and Brown Bullhead).Conclusions Multiple species remain susceptible to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus under enzootic conditions; however, viral infections are distributed unevenly among host species. Invasive Round Gobies have amplified reservoir competence compared to native fish species. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus is a multi-host fish pathogen that has caused large, sporadic fish kills in the Great Lakes region since emergence in 2005. This study compares viral prevalence and titers among fish species that may represent viral reservoirs enabling long-term persistence in the upper St. Lawrence River.																			0899-7659	1548-8667				SEP	2025	37	3					136	146		10.1093/jahafs/vsaf011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jahafs/vsaf011		SEP 2025						40901715					WOS:001563867100001

Palaeomagnetic evidence from one of the cores and Pb-210 analysis of another, suggests that the increase in sediment Cu and Zn concentrations began during the eighteenth century. A sharp increase in the concentrations of these metals in the sediment profile appears to have occurred during the latter part of the eighteenth century and these concentrations remained high until the mid to late nineteenth century. The absence of known ore deposits and industry around the lake suggests that the lake and catchment soils were increasingly contaminated by long-range aerial transport of emissions from the expanding activity of Cu and Zn smelters located some 80 km upwind in the Swansea area during the Industrial Revolution. Evidence from agricultural crop returns indicates a significant increase in the amount of land devoted to tillage in the catchment, particularly to cereal production, during the late eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century which included the Napoleonic Wars. This agricultural shift appears to coincide with increased concentrations of Cu and Zn in the lake sediments. It is suggested that newly ploughed soils, contaminated with metals for many years by long-range aerial transport from the Swansea area, eroded, and were carried into the lake by catchment run-off and added to the sediment burden of Cu and Zn. A subsequent decline of Cu and Zn emissions due to the collapse of the non-ferrous smelting industry and reduced soil erosion because of a 50% reduction of tillage due to an agricultural depression in the second half of the 19th century may explain the fall in Cu and Zn concentrations in the upper part of the sediment profile. The most recent sediments (20th century) show the increase in heavy metals characteristic of many lakes around the world.

J	Newete, SW; Chirima, GJ; Tswai, R				Newete, Solomon W.; Chirima, George J.; Tswai, Richard			Bush encroachment and invasive alien plant species' linkage to outmigration	DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY												The most prominent drivers of international migration across borders and internal migration-rural to urban areas are explained by the 'push and pull' migration model. However, this model falls short in addressing migrations driven by the impacts of climate change, such as the movement from rural to urban area as a coping strategy for environmental degradation. Factors like deforestation, desertification, droughts, and floods are key drivers of such migration. Additionally, bush encroachment and the spread of invasive alien plant species disrupt landscapes and negatively affect ecosystem goods and services in many arid and semi-arid regions around the world. This phenomenon directly affects the livelihoods of rural communities by depriving them of their croplands, rangelands, and ranches. Despite this, there is a lack of sufficient information on how these factors are linked to migratory movements, whether from rural to urban areas or between rural regions. To explore this connection, this study reviewed scientific publications, including journal articles and books using key phrases such as, 'push and pull migration factors', 'impact of bush encroachment on migration' and 'impact of invasive alien plants on migration factors', among others. A total of 155 documents were downloaded via Google Scholar, of which 99 were thoroughly reviewed and included in the study. The remaining 53 documents were skimmed and excluded due to their irrelevance, or limited contribution to the research. The study found that the bush encroachment and invasive plant species in rangelands are significant push factors for driving migration, both between rural areas and rural to urban areas. It is, therefore, recommended that these two factors be given a greater attention when addressing outmigration from rural regions.																				2662-9984				JUN 10	2025	6	1							521	10.1007/s43621-025-01278-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01278-7													WOS:001505497700003

Spring habitat use by stocked one year old European sturgeon Acipenser sturio in the freshwater-oligohaline area of the Gironde estuary	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Post release habitat selection was studied on forty eight 10-month-old hatchery reared European sturgeon (mean fork length 31.0 cm +/- 3.0) in the tidal part of their native catchment using acoustic telemetry. Most of the fish reached the oligohaline estuary within 2-4 days (70 km downstream the release site). Seventy four percent of the fish migrated rapidly downstream of the estuary into mesohaline waters while 26% selected habitat in the freshwater/oligohaline part of the estuary based on their linearity and residency indices. We focused on individual habitat use of these fish. The home range size (HR) was calculated using two methods: the kernel utilization distribution (KUD) which is driven by the maximum detection location density, and the Brownian Bridge (BB) approach which allows the time component of the trajectory path to be taken into account. The average 50% HR KUD was 5.6 +/- 2.7 km(2) (range 1.1 -10.3 km(2)) and it was estimated to be 6 times larger using the 50% HR BB method (average reaching 31.9 +/- 20.7 km(2), range 5.2-77.8 km(2)). Habitat characterization (available prey, substrate and depth) in the studied area was described and the Ivlev electivity index was calculated using the habitat within the 50% HR BB for each individual. Despite the spatial use of different core areas among the fish tagged, we observed a convergence in habitat preference. For substrates, sturgeons showed avoidance of gravel and large rocks as well as fine and medium gravel. There was a significant preference for sand, silts and clay. For depth, they exhibited a preference firstly for the 5-8 m depth range and secondly for the 2-5 m range, a strong avoidance of depth range 8-20 m and a slight avoidance of shallow (0-2 m) and intertidal areas. For prey, individual variability was high. The most homogenous results were found for annelid polychaeta, with a slight preference for areas with this group of preys which,are abundant in the saline estuary. For some individuals, a preference for areas with crustacea or nematodea and avoidance for areas with mollusks, insects or oligochaeta occured. We explain our results in light of foraging behavior and adaptation to the wild environment after captivity. For sturgeon population restoration projects in western Europe, these habitat preferences are key features needed to evaluate the essential habitat availability for A. sturio juveniles in the tidal area at the front of the freshwater/saline transition waters.

The intermediate host is an aquatic or amphibious snail (Oncamelania hupensis). The World Health Organization describes schistosomiasis as 'the second most important (tropical disease) in terms of public health importance' after malaria. It is endemic in 76 developing countries, putting over 600 million people at risk of infection. Over 200 million people are estimated to be infected worldwide, with 20,000 deaths annually. Officials detected 10.58 million square meters of new snail habitats in 2005, up 0.44 percent over 2004 when China had 3.85 billion square meters of snail habitats, according to figures front the Ministry of Health. To be effective, schistosomiasis control strategies should he adapted to the local epidemiological situation and caution must he taken when destroying freshwater snails using chemicals - particularly in terms of impact on the environment. One of the effective practices in China is conducting forestry ecological engineering that focuses on snail control and schistosomiasis prevention through improving environment and refraining snail propagation. Test plot located at Dongting Lake, Hunan province, where usually was most endemic areas. Poplars were planted according to the certain designs, site preparation was done to wipe out weeds and pile up ridges, spacing was 6m X 8m, and undisturbed site was as the check. After 12 years, the results indicated that snail density was decreased 85.2%-100% in poplar stands; while for the check, the figure was increased 108.2%-120%. and particularly no infected snail were found in poplar stands. With tree growing up, the number of snails fell. As well, poplars growing added incomes for local farmers. By the experiment, it was concluded that improving environment to reduce the amount of snail was available through forestation in wet beach areas.

J	Barinova, S; Chekryzheva, T				Barinova, Sophia; Chekryzheva, Tatjana			Phytoplankton dynamic and bioindication in the Kondopoga Bay, Lake Onego (Northern Russia)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												On the basis of our collected material and historical information we assess phytoplankton dynamics in Kondopoga Bay, the Lake Onego in 1993-2011. The summer communities from continuously studied sampling stations contain 100 species belonging to eight divisions: Bacillariophyta, 40; Chlorophyta, 25; Cyanobacteria, 13; Chrysophyta, 12; Euglenophyta, 2; Dinophyta, 4; Cryptophyta, 3; and Xanthophyta, 1. Sample richness varied between 16 and 54 species, with a negative overall trend during the study period, but increases in Cyanobacteria and Dinophyta. Bioindication analysis shows that water acidification slowly rising from 1993 to 2011 with organic pollution (Index saprobity S) and the number of species with heterotrophic ability. In 1990s, the total abundance and biomass were on average 1.5 times higher than in 2000-2011, having similar fluctuation ranges (Pearson 0.74), with peaks in 1996 and 2006. At the same time, species richness decreased, showing a depletion of algal communities. Two critically impacted periods are revealed with the Shannon index in 1996 and 2007 and on the basis of the Aquatic Ecosystem State Index (WESI) calculation in 1995 and 2007, related to Kondopoga industrial wastewater influx enriched in nutrients and other contaminants. As a whole, the WESI was extremely high, reflecting a high self-purification capacity in respect to phosphate concentration in the bay. The canonical corresponded analysis (CCA) shows two different sets of taxa, those stimulated by temperature and nitric nitrogen (Anabaena scheremetievii Elenkin, Dolichospermum lemmermannii (Ricter) P. Wacklin, L. Hoffmann & J. Komarek, and Aulacoseira alpigena (Grunow) Krammer), and sensitive autotroph species inhabiting cool to temperate clear waters (Aulacoseira distans (Ehrenberg) Simonsen, Ankistrodesmus fusiformis Corda ex Korshikov, Mucidosphaerium pulchellum (H.C. Wood) C. Bock, Proschold & Krienitz). The comparative statistics with GRAPS program revealed two cores of species richness in years 1996 and 2011 that included most of species. The long-term dynamics of relative cell volume shows that phytoplankton communities were enriched with small-celled species, such as Cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa (Kutzing) Kutzing) and Cryptophyta (Cryptomonas sp. and Katablepharis ovalis Skuja) in the period between 1998 and 2006. Pearson correlation for Shannon index and relative cell biovolume is negative (-0.79), showing high stability of species rich communities under environmental impacts. Two periods of dinoflagellate blooms (1998, 2007) followed the peaks of total abundance and biomass (1996, 2006). Such correlation makes the Kondopoga Bay ecosystem comparable to those of large lakes in spite of a heavier anthropogenic impact from Kondopoga pulp and paper mill wastewater.

J	Huang, XT; Oberhänsli, H; von Suchodoletz, H; Sorrel, P				Huang, Xiangtong; Oberhaensli, Hedi; von Suchodoletz, Hans; Sorrel, Philippe			Dust deposition in the Aral Sea: implications for changes in atmospheric circulation in central Asia during the past 2000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We investigated mineral aerosol (dust) deposition in the Aral Sea with intention to understand the variability of dust in central Asia and its implications for atmospheric circulation change in the late Holocene. Using an 11.12-m sediment core of the lake, we calculated bulk sediment fluxes at high time-resolution and analyzed grain-size distributions of detrital sediments. A refined age-depth model was established by combined methods of radiocarbon dating and archeological evidence. Besides, a principal component analysis (PCA) of grain-size fractions and elements (Fe, Ti, K, Ca, Sr) was used to assess the potential processes controlling detrital inputs. The results suggest that two processes are mainly relevant for the clastic input as the medium silt fractions and Ti, Fe and K are positively correlated with Component 1 (Cl), and the fine size fractions (<6 mu m) are positively correlated with Component 2 (C2). Taking the results of the PCA, geological backgrounds, clastic input processes into account, we propose that the medium silt fractions and, in particular, the grain-size fraction ratio (6-32 mu m/2-6 mu m), can serve as indicators of the variability of airborne dust in the Aral Sea region. On the contrary, the fine size fractions appear to be contributed mainly by the sheetwash processes. The bulk sediment deposition fluxes were extremely high during the Little Ice Age (LIA; AD 1400-1780), which may be related to the increased dust deposition. As indicated by the variations of grain-size ratio and Ti, the history of dust deposition in central Asia can be divided into five distinct periods, with a remarkably low deposition during AD 1-350, a moderately high value from AD 350-720, a return to relatively low level between AD 720 and AD 1400 (including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, AD 755-1070)), an exceptionally high deposition from AD 1400 to 1940s and an abnormally low value since 1940s. The temporal variations in the dust deposition are consistent with the changes in the Siberian High (SH) and mean atmospheric temperature of the northern hemisphere during the past 2000 years, with low/high annual temperature anomalies corresponding to high/low dust supplies in the Aral Sea sediments, respectively. The variations in the fine size fraction also show a broadly similarity to a lacustrine delta O-18 record in Turkey (Jones et al., 2006), implying that there was less moisture entering western central Asia from the Mediterranean during the LIA than during the MWP.

J	Pollier, CGL; Guerrero, AN; Rabassa, J; Ariztegui, D				Pollier, Clement G. L.; Guerrero, Alejandro N.; Rabassa, Jorge; Ariztegui, Daniel			The hidden biotic face of microbialite morphogenesis - a case study from Laguna de Los Cisnes, southernmost Patagonia (Chile)	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Microbialites provide geological evidence into Earth's early ecosystems, recording long-standing interactions between co-evolving life and the environment. Yet, after more than 100 years of research, the complex interplay between environmental and biological forces involved in microbialite growth is still debated. Laguna de Los Cisnes, located in Chilean Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia, provides a unique opportunity to study these interactions. This lake, which became ice-free around 10 000 years ago, features carbonate microbialites developed by algal-microbial communities. Macroscopically, the organo-sedimentary deposits exhibit a consistent primary crater-like architecture, showcasing macrostructural variations such as dish-shaped, hemispherical, columnar and lenticular morphologies. This study explores the environmental and biological factors shaping microbialite macrostructure by analysing the distribution of dominant morphotypes across the basin. Concurrently, it examines the internal mesostructure and microstructure of microbialites in association with prevailing algal-microbial communities. The incremental development of these communities contributes to the distinct crater-like morphology observed in microbialites from Laguna de Los Cisnes. The mineral encrustation of the green alga Percursaria percursa emerges as a primary driver of lithification, evidenced by the preservation of microfossils within the microstructure of the microbialites. Simultaneously, physical environmental factors, including waves, Langmuir cells and accommodation space influence the location of the algal-microbial carbonate factory, determining the spatial distribution and temporal succession of different crater architecture variants. Laguna de Los Cisnes, hosting well-preserved subfossil outcrops and living microbialites, serves as a remarkable living laboratory for understanding microbialite morphogenesis. This study contributes to a novel model that captures the fundamental role of algal-microbial communities in determining the primary macrostructural architecture of microbialites before environmental factors come into play, merely reshaping this architecture into different morphotypes.					; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Guerrero-Lopez, Alejandro/KHE-3979-2024	Pollier, Clement/0000-0002-5810-0317; Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	2024	71	5					1615	1638		10.1111/sed.13189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.13189		MAR 2024											WOS:001182171100001

Enzyme activities of phytoplankton in the South Shetland Islands (Antarctica) in relation to nutrients and primary production	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Given the potential significance of enzyme activities as a link between internal metabolic pathways and environmental nutrients, we investigated the relationships of nitrate reductase (NR) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) with primary production and inorganic nutrients in South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Enzymatic activities of the phytoplankton (0.7-210 mu m), primary productivity, autotrophic biomass and inorganic nutrients were studied in the upper 100 m depth at nine stations during a cruise in the northwestern area of South Shetland Islands (Antarctica), during late austral spring (December 2000). NR activities fluctuated between 0 and 42.8 nmol L-1 h(-1) (mean 10.08 nmol L-1 h(-1), SD = 10.42 nmol L-1 h(-1)), AP activities between 0.81 and 5.67 nmol L-1 h(-1) (mean 2.68 nmol L-1 h(-1), SD = 0.95 nmol L-1 h(-1)). Stations with primary productivity (PP) and chlorophyll a greater than 2 mg C m(-3) h(-1) and 0.75 mu g chlorophyll a L-1, respectively, presented higher enzymatic activities of nitrate reductase, alkaline phosphatase than those stations characterized by primary productivity and chlorophyll a less than 2 mg C m(-3) h(-1) and 0.17 mu g chlorophyll a L-1, respectively. The AP specific activity was negatively correlated with orthophosphate concentrations lower than 2.0 mu M, which indicates that the microplankton were under phosphate deficient environment condition. Our results indicated that NR specific activity was positively associated with autotrophic biomass and primary productivity estimates, giving evidence of the use of nitrate by phytoplankton as external nitrogen source in surface waters. In addition, high NR activities were positively correlated with NO3-, suggesting the occurrence of nitrate respiration in the well oxygenated surface waters of Antarctica.

J	Hojabri, J; Aydin, Y				Hojabri, Javid; Aydin, Yusuf			Spatio-temporal Dynamics of Land Surface Temperature and Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Urmia Lake Basin: Exploring Land-Atmosphere Interactions Through Satellite Data and Ground Observations (2000-2023)	EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics play a crucial role in understanding land-atmosphere interactions, serving as a key indicator of environmental and climate changes. This study investigates the LST dynamics in the Urmia Lake Basin (ULB) in northwestern Iran. Using MODIS products and Landsat images, this study examines the spatiotemporal variations in LST and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes from 2000 to 2023, with a focus on the August month. The results indicated an increase of about 9.63 degrees C in the average Urmia Lake Surface Temperature (ULST) over the study period, highlighting the severe impact of the lake's drying. In contrast, Basin Surface Temperature (BST) showed no consistent trend, declining from 2000 to 2009, peaking at 43.2 degrees C in 2017, then falling to 41 degrees C by 2023. This fluctuation reflects cooling effects from irrigated agriculture, which expanded 1.83 times since 2000, enhancing evapotranspiration and altering land surface heat dynamics. The accuracy assessment was carried out by comparing MODIS-LST results and ground-based temperature measurements from five synoptic stations. Several statistical parameters were used to evaluate the results, including the correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS). The assessment revealed strong statistical indicators, with R values ranging from 0.29 to 0.78 and MBE values ranging between 0.36 degrees C and 0.65 degrees C across studied stations. These results confirm the reliability of the study, demonstrating that the satellite derived results effectively represent LST and LULC dynamics in the region, further solidifying the robustness of the findings.

This study offers a rapid and efficient electroanalytical approach for detecting Gly in various water sources, utilizing SrxZn1-xO/g-C3N4 composite materials. The SrxZn1-xO solid solution, which exhibits a hexagonal wurtzite structure, was synthesized through a sol-gel method followed by a hydrothermal treatment. The synthesized SrxZn1-xO and g-C3N4 structures were characterized using XRD, FTIR, XPS and SEM techniques. Electrochemical evaluation of the SrxZn1-xO/g-C3N4 electrodes revealed enhanced charge transfer properties and a high density of active sites, particularly for the Sr0.025Zn0.975O/g-C3N4 configuration. This electrode demonstrated effective detection of Gly via electrochemical reduction, using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at a potential of-0.719 V vs. Ag/AgCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7), without requiring any pre-treatment steps. The DPV response exhibited linearity across two concentration ranges: The concentration ranges from 0 to 10 nM and from 10 to 100 nM. The method demonstrated an impressive limit of detection (LOD) of 0.14 nM and a notable limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.45 nM, signifying exceptional sensitivity. The application of the Sr0.025Zn0.975O/g-C3N4 sensor to real-world water samples yielded Gly concentrations of 4.1 +/- 0.29 nM in Sapanca Lake water, 7.3 +/- 0.45 nM in natural spring water, and 2.9 +/- 0.33 M in tap water-all collected from T & uuml;rkiye. These results present innovative ap-proaches for the accurate, rapid, practical and low detection limit analysis of Gly contamination of the developed sensor and confirm its potential for in situ environmental monitoring.

Managing a cyanobacterial bloom in a shallow seepage lake in the North Carolina Coastal Plain	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lauritsen DD. 2025. One and done? Managing a cyanobacterial bloom in a shallow seepage lake in the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Lake Reserv Manage. XXX-XXX. White Lake, a small, clearwater, historically acidic and low nutrient natural lake, has had increases in pH and total nitrogen (TN) that reflect recent changes in rainfall chemistry in the region. In the fall of 2017, a filamentous cyanobacterial bloom began, and the invasive weed hydrilla was found in >80% of the lake. An alum treatment to mitigate the bloom and reduce P levels was recommended by science advisors. A rapid increase in pH in the days prior to the treatment start was the root cause of a fish kill during the period when the lake pH was >9. By 8 weeks post treatment, filamentous cyanobacteria biovolumes were significantly reduced and total phosphorus (TP) levels dropped 66%, and these reductions have been sustained; phosphorus levels were comparable to historical levels, and the same was true of taxa dominating phytoplankton biovolumes (generally desmids). Rainfall was a diffuse source of dissolved N and P, with lake TN/TP (mass) ratios close to rainfall TN/TP ratios. Naturally occurring Al was more abundant than Fe in the muddy sediments of White Lake and nearby Lake Waccamaw, and no significant anoxic soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) release was found in either lake. White Lake pH levels have generally remained between 6.2 and 7.2 since the treatment and little to no hydrilla has been seen, although conditions that can foster cyanobacterial blooms may again be seen in this more productive shallow lake. Sustained monitoring is critical to inform the type and timing of any future management actions.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUL 3	2025	41	3					239	259		10.1080/10402381.2025.2532463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2025.2532463		JUL 2025											WOS:001566444600001
J	Gedulter, N; Agnon, A; Levin, N				Gedulter, Nuphar; Agnon, Amotz; Levin, Noam			Dead Sea Stromatolite Reefs: Testing Ground for Remote Sensing Automated Detection of Life Forms and Their Traces in Harsh Environments	REMOTE SENSING												The Dead Sea is one of the most saline terminal lakes on Earth, and few organisms survive in this harsh environment. In some onshore spring pools, active and diverse microbial communities flourish. In the geological past, microbial-rich environments left their marks in the form of stromatolites. Stromatolites are studied to better understand the appearance of life on Earth and potentially on other planets. Hyperspectral methodologies have been shown to be useful for detecting structures in stromatolites. In an effort to characterize the biosignatures and chemical composition inherent to stromatolites, we created a spectral classification scheme for distinguishing between stromatolites and their bedrock environment-typically carbonatic rocks, mostly dolomites. The overarching aim comprises the development of an automated hyperspectral reflectance method for detecting the presence of stromatolites. We collected and measured 82 field samples with an ASD spectrometer and used our spectral dataset to train three machine learning algorithms (linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost). The results show the successful detection of stromatolites, with all three prediction methods giving high accuracy rates (stromatolite > 0.9, bedrock dolomite > 0.8). The continuum removal and spectral ratio technique results identified two significant spectral regions, similar to 1900 nm (water) and similar to 2310-2320 nm (carbonates), that allow one to differentiate between stromatolites and dolomites. This study establishes the grounds for the automated detection of a fossilized livable environment in a carbonatic terrain based on its hyperspectral reflectance data. The results have significant implications for future mapping efforts and emphasize the feasibility of automated mapping, extending the data acquisition to airborne or satellite-based hyperspectral remote sensing technologies to detect life forms in extreme environments.

Groundwater Decline and Prolonged Drought Could Reduce Vigour, Enhance Vulnerability to Diseases and Pests and Kill Perennial Horticultural Crops: Needs Urgent Policy Intervention	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCES												Perennial horticulture in India has undergone a change from rainfed system to drip fertigation systems and from isolated hedge and bund trees to high intensity orchard systems with enhanced number of trees per unit area. In several parts, particularly in the Deccan plateau, the system has now become completely dependent on water pumped from tube wells. Severe competition for water from tube wells makes farmers to devote more water for cash rich annual crops and even sell water for city dwellers nearby. As a consequence, the groundwater level in the past three decades has fallen from few feet to above thousand feet. At several places it has crossed the "peak water". Frequent and prolonged exposure of fruit trees and nuts to drought coupled with ground water depletion has led to soil profile drying leading to reduced vigour and enhanced vulnerability to diseases and pests. This has led to withering of fruit and nut trees. Perennial crops are likely to become increasingly maladapted to their environment, particularly in the earlier period of climate change they are more likely to be attacked by diseases and insects. Coconuts, areca nuts and mango trees have died in several places and the government constituted committees have recommended compensation to the farmers. As a country, we have dramatically increased our reliance on groundwater. 175 million Indians are now fed with food produced with the unsustainable use of groundwater. This increase has dried up rivers and lakes, because there is a hydrologic connection between groundwater and surface water. Yet the legal rules governing water use usually ignore the link between law and science. The issue needs thorough examination and needs policy interventions to come out of this vicious circle.

Sedimentology, petrography, and carbon isotopes of the ∼2.2 Ga Randville Dolomite, Upper Peninsula of Michigan	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE) was Earth's longest (2.3-2.0 Ga) and largest (+5 to +30 parts per thousand) positive delta C-13 excursion. The LJE's exact causes remain uncertain, with various hypotheses involving increased organic carbon burial or restricted depositional facies. While many LJE carbonates have enriched delta C-13 signatures, several locations are closer to average values over Earth history (similar to 0 parts per thousand), providing opportunities to test depositional models. For example, the similar to 2.2 Ga Randville Dolomite in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is less enriched in delta C-13 (0 to +3 parts per thousand) compared to the neighboring Kona Dolomite (+5 to +10 parts per thousand). Randville age constraints are broad but fall within the LJE (2.3-2.1 Ga), approximately coeval with Kona deposits (2.17 Ga). The Randville Dolomite contains extensive planar beds with minor scour-fill structures, slumps, and conglomerates, indicating a relatively calm depositional environment punctuated by storms and slope failures on an outer carbonate platform. Randville deposits contain a variety of microbialites including domal, inclined, nodular, and conical stromatolites, and potentially the oldest recorded dendrolites. The most likely explanation for delta C-13 differences between the Randville and Kona Dolomite involves depositional environments. Many enriched Kona deposits represent an evaporitic, marine basin, while Randville facies show little to no evidence for subaerial exposure or evaporation. Facies-dependent patterns between Randville and Kona Dolomites are mirrored in LJE carbonates across the Lake Superior region: formations with evaporites are consistently delta C-13-enriched compared with other localities. These datasets support previous research indicating that at least during certain intervals, LJE excursions were not ubiquitous in all marine environments.																			0301-9268	1872-7433				NOV	2025	430								107916	10.1016/j.precamres.2025.107916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2025.107916													WOS:001575353100001
J	Ebbs, S; Talbott, J; Sankaran, R				Ebbs, Stephen; Talbott, Jonathan; Sankaran, Renuka			Cultivation of garden vegetables in Peoria Pool sediments from the Illinois River: A case study in trace element accumulation and dietary exposures	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												This case study was conducted to evaluate the use of reclaimed lake sediment as a growth media for vegetable production and to estimate whether accumulation of micronutrients and heavy metals in the vegetables would impact human nutrition or health, respectively. Five plant species, bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), pepper (Capsicum annum L.), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.), were grown in pots containing either reclaimed sediment from the Illinois River or a reference soil. Edible and vegetative tissues from the plants were analyzed for 19 elements, including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn. Tomato and pepper grown in sediment showed significantly greater biomass and yield as compared to plants from the reference soil. Elemental analysis of the tissues revealed that Zn and Mo were the only elements that were significantly greater in sediment-grown plants on a consistent basis. While significant, Zn concentrations were no more than 3-fold higher than those in plants from the reference soil. The same trend was observed for Mo, except for bean tissues, which showed a 10-fold greater concentration in sediment-grown plants. The projected dietary intake of Cu, Mo, and Zn from consumption of sediment-grown vegetable tissues was significantly higher than for soil-grown plants, although the contribution to the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for these elements was substantial only for Mo. Intake of sediment-grown beans would have provided 500% of the dietary Mo RDA. While this is below the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) value for this element, there is no evidence to indicate that there would be a nutritional or therapeutic benefit from the consumption of bean containing this level of Mo. The dietary exposures to Cd and Pb would have been below the pertinent limits for all age and gender groups with the exception of the cumulative dietary Cd exposure to the 1-3 year age group. The results from this study suggest that this reclaimed sediment can be utilized for the production of vegetables intended for human consumption. The results from this case study also suggest that sediment material with similar physicochemical characteristics and elemental concentrations that fall within the pertinent regulatory guidelines should also be a suitable and safe medium for vegetable production.

Flows over sills out of lakes are modelled using the equation for a broad-crested weir, with the model time increment set to one day. The model was evaluated for Lake Agassiz outlet sill widths of 1, 4, and 10 km and with outbursts ranging from 100 000 m(3) s(-1) to 600 000 m(3) s(-1). The surface area of Lake Agassiz was evaluated for 182 000 km(2) +/- 20%. The surface area of the upper Great Lakes were modelled as either Lake Algonquin (Superior, Huron and Michigan basins = 200 000 km(2)) or Lake Minong (Superior basin 87 000 km(2)) with sill widths of 0.5, 1.5, and 3 km. Downstream peak discharge modelled at the outlet sill of the upper Great Lakes, was normally between 20 and 60% of the initial outburst, with a lagtime to peak usually between 80 and 280 days. Upper Great Lakes water level rises of between 2 and 20 m are calculated with rises to 36 m for some configurations. Rise magnitude is inversely related to the width of the outlet sills at both lake systems and to the surface area of the receiving lake. The modeling implies that measuring outflow from the upper Great Lakes, or water level rises, does not in itself determine peak or total outflow from Lake Agassiz unless the dimensions of the Lake Agassiz and upper Great Lakes outflow sills are also known. Lake level rises probably coincided on the upper Great Lakes with meltout from the winter freeze-up. Lake levels re-attain equilibrium values with respect to through flow within three years of an outburst. Substantial episodic lake level rises in the upper Great Lakes may have had severe impacts on the lake biota, for example via the affect on spawning grounds.																			0921-2728					MAY	1995	13	3					251	266		10.1007/BF00682768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00682768													WOS:A1995RP37300005

Effects of water depth on survival, condition and stable isotope values of three invasive dreissenid species in a deep freshwater lake	AQUATIC INVASIONS												To examine the effects of depth on the performance of the freshwater dreissenid species Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis, and the brackish water dreissenid, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, a controlled experiment lasting four months was conducted in a manmade freshwater lake in the Netherlands. The three species used in the experiment were collected from other water bodies in the Netherlands. Cages containing each species in separate compartments were placed at water depths of 2, 5, 10 and 17 m from November 2009 until February 2010. Samples of individuals were retrieved at the start and at approximately four-week incubation intervals, for determination of overall survival, condition and soft tissue carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. In contrast to the Dreissena species, survival of M. leucophaeata decreased strongly over time at each depth. Mortality increased with increasing depth and was greatest at 17 m. Survival of D. polymorpha at 17 m was much greater than that of D. rostriformis bugensis. The condition of all species after 3.5 weeks did not differ significantly from that at the start. Surviving M. leucophaeata showed a significantly reduced condition at all depths after 16 weeks. Both Dreissena species showed an improved condition at depths of 2, 5 and 10 m after 16 weeks, the greatest improvement being found at 2 m. After 16 weeks at 17 m, both Dreissena species had the lowest condition index. Stable isotope ratios of soft tissue for both Dreissena species showed a shift in delta N-15 within 3.5 weeks. The delta N-15 values of mussels held at 2-10 m fell. Those held at 17 m had values similar to that initially recorded, possibly indicative of very limited food intake at that depth or a diet similar to that at their location of origin. After 16 weeks, delta C-13 values became more negative than those at the start, in particular at 2 m. The stable isotope ratios of soft tissue of M. leucophaeata did not change at any depth throughout the experiment, possibly indicating lack of feeding in the freshwater lake. Changes in stable isotope values for both Dreissena species were reduced at 17 m. Mortality of D. polymorpha was lower at 17 m compared to the other two dreissenid species which indicated greater tolerance of habitat conditions a this deeper depth.

J	Alam, MA; Sepúlveda, R				Alam, Mohammad Ayaz; Sepulveda, Rosa			Environmental degradation through mining for energy resources: The case of the shrinking Laguna Santa Rosa wetland in the Atacama Region of Chile	ENERGY GEOSCIENCE												As the world strives to replace fossil fuels with clean energy - reflected by global surge in the number of electric vehicles - the environmental impact of mining all the lithium (Li) needed to enable such a transformation has become a problem in its own right. In South America, the biggest problem is the excessive use of water in Li extraction process in one of the driest areas in the world. Apart from causing severe friction over water rights between local communities and mining companies, it puts enormous pressure on the region's fragile and poorly understood wetland ecosystems. Wetlands are one of the most threatened ecosystems on the Earth, despite their great importance as habitats for a vast number of species and corresponding to one of the most productive environments. Present work is the outcome of an investigation on Laguna Santa Rosa's (LSR) vulnerability resulting from ongoing metal mining operations in its surroundings that require a large volume of water extracted from local aquifers, in addition to a high evaporation rate in the area. This groundwater-dependent wetland will soon be further vulnerable with the commencement of water-intensive Li mining at Salar de Maricunga, with the extraction project already having an environmental impact study approved. Sustainability of this wetland protected under the Ramsar Convention and home to numerous wildlife species habiting this highland sector of the Andean Cordillera is vital for the associated ecosystems. The variation in the water surface area of LSR has been deciphered through the application of a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image collection. This has been done both for the hydrological year 2016-2017 and 1993-2014 period. A decreasing trend in the water surface area of LSR, a hypersaline lake at the southern extreme of Salar de Maricunga, a salt flat in the Atacama Region of Chile, was observed through the study of satellite images between 1993 and 2014, showing shrinking of this wetland. However, this shrinking trend was punctuated by extreme rainfall and consequent flood with accumulated precipitation exceeding 40 mm in a single day and hourly mean rainfall rates higher than 10 mm/h recorded at several locations in the hyperarid Atacama Desert on March 25, 2015. This raised the lake's water level, and thus the areal extent of the lake water observed in the satellite images of the 2016-2017 hydrological year following the extreme weather events of 2015. The interplay of such extreme weather events and groundwater extraction for mining activities in the area complicates the assessment of the latter's effect on LSR, as the evaluation is constrained to the intervals between successive extreme weather events. In addition, the water level increases in summer because of the thawing of the snow. Close monitoring of the wetlands like LSR is essential to ensure their sustainability by considering both anthropic and climatic factors.

J	Mischke, S; Zhang, CJ; Börner, A; Herzschuh, U				Mischke, Steffen; Zhang, Chengjun; Boerner, Anko; Herzschuh, Ulrike			Lateglacial and Holocene variation in aeolian sediment flux over the northeastern Tibetan Plateau recorded by laminated sediments of a saline meromictic lake	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Predominantly laminated lake sediments from a saline closed-basin lake on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were investigated using a multi-proxy approach (C-14-accelerator mass spectrometry dating, smear-slide analysis, loss on ignition, grain size, X-ray diffraction, elemental concentration, ostracod assemblages, stable isotopes of ostracod shells) to trace the regional environmental and climatic history in the Lateglacial and Holocene. Before about 15 cal. ka BP, small saline water bodies probably filled the basin under unstable cold and harsh environmental conditions. Soon after about 14.9 cal. ka BP, a relatively deep saline lake was established, probably as a result of runoff from melting snow, ice and frozen ground in the lake's catchment. Large changes in flux of aeolian material to the lake were recorded during this initial period of formation of Lake Kuhai. Highest lake levels, a low sediment accumulation rate and less saline conditions were maintained between about 12.8 and 7.1 cal. ka BP when the aeolian influx diminished significantly. After about 7.1 cal. ka BP, the aeolian influx remained at a moderate level apart from a strongly increased dust delivery to the lake between about 6.1 and 5.4 cal. ka BP and a minor short-lived period of slightly enhanced aeolian influx at about 2.7 cal. ka BP. The strongly enhanced dust input to the lake between 6.1 and 5.4 cal. ka BP represented the largest influx of aeolian material to Lake Kuhai during the entire Holocene. However, evidence for climatic deterioration during this period is not seen at most other palaeoclimate sites on the Tibetan Plateau, but instead a significant increase in aridity has been recorded at numerous sites in the northern foreland of the Tibetan Plateau and on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The large dust input to Lake Kuhai between 6.1 and 5.4 cal. ka BP probably did not result from a severe climate deterioration on the Tibetan Plateau itself, but from the pronounced aridity in its northern and eastern foreland. In contrast, the increase in dust influx about 2.7 cal. ka BP seems to correspond to a brief warming spell recorded at other sites on the Tibetan Plateau too. A slight increase in lake level and decrease in salinity after about 0.6 cal. ka BP suggests a slightly higher effective moisture during the final lake stage, accompanied by a somewhat larger dust influx. This apparent contradiction possibly results from enhanced human activities on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the last 600 years. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Purse seining with the use of light is among the most common fishing practices around the world, but there is lack of studies on the effect of light on the feeding of the target species in this kind of fishery and the possible consequences for other prey species. The presently reported investigation intended to provide indications on this issue by studying the diet of Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810, which is the target species of professional purse seine fishery, conducted using light in Lake Trichonis (Greece), and by comparing the acquired results with those of previous studies where the samples were taken without using light. Materials and methods. A seven-month (June through December 2014) purse seining fishing was conducted at night around two lamp rafts: 1) a traditional lamp raft producing white LED light and 2) an autonomous photovoltaic-battery-LED lamp raft producing green LED light. Stomach content analysis was conducted on 100 randomly selected specimens from each sample and the relative prey abundance and frequency of occurrence for each prey category was estimated. Calculations of predation pressure of A. boyeri upon the fish larvae of a goby, Economidichthys trichonis Economidis et Miller, 1990, were performed. Results. The study revealed the intense effect of light on the attraction and capture of prey species rarely found in previous studies, such as the larvae of the native and endangered fish E. trichonis, amphipods, and copepod nauplii. No significant differences were observed between the two light colours. A preference shift to larger prey with the increase of ontogenetic stage of A. boyeri was observed. Several thousands of pre-recruited E. trichonis larvae may be preyed upon each night around a single lamp especially during summer. Conclusion. Fishing with light may alter the dietary preference of the target fish species and even of the entire fish community. This may have serious consequences on the younger ontogenetic stages of other fish populations, especially when it coincides with their reproductive period. Considering the lack of similar field studies, the present results may stimulate analogous investigations on the effects of fishing lights in other marine and freshwater ecosystems worldwide.																			0137-1592	1734-1515					2018	48	1					51	60		10.3750/AIEP/02329	http://dx.doi.org/10.3750/AIEP/02329													WOS:000429559200006
J	Hallett, DJ; Hills, L				Hallett, DJ; Hills, L			Holocene vegetation dynamics, fire history, lake level and climate change in the Kootenay Valley, southeastern British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The environmental history of the Kootenay Valley in the southern Canadian Rockies was reconstructed using lake sediment from Dog Lake, British Columbia, and compared to other paleoenvironmental studies in the region to understand how vegetation dynamics and fire regimes responded to climate change during the Holocene. A pollen-based vegetation reconstruction indicates five periods of vegetation change. At 10,300 cal yr B.P. Pinus-Juniperus parkland colonized the valley and by 7600 cal yr B.P. was replaced by mixed stands of Pinus, Picea and Pseudotsuga/Larix. Fire frequencies increased to their Holocene maximums during the 8200-4000 cal yr B.P. period. From 5500-4500 cal yr B.P. Pseudotsuga/Larix reached its maximum extent in the Kootenay Valley under a more frequent fire regime. At 5000 cal yr B.P. Picea and Abies began to expand in the area and by 4500 cal yr B.P. the forest shifted to a closed montane spruce forest type with dramatically reduced fire frequency. The shift to less frequent forest fires after 4500 cal yr B.P., along with a moisterPicea - dominated closed forest, corresponds to Neoglacial advances in the Canadian Rockies and Coast Mountains. Fire intervals after 4000 cal yr B.P. are significantly longer than the shorter fire intervals of the early to mid Holocene. A return to drier, more open forest condition occurs between 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. with a slight increase in fire activity and summer drought events. Lower lake levels inferred by charophyte accumulation rates during the 2400-1200 cal yr B.P. interval support this moisture regime shift. An abrupt shift toPicea dominated forest occurred from 1200-1000 cal yr B.P. and a final period of wet-closed forest cover reaches its maximum extent from 700-150 cal yr B.P. that appears to be a response to Little Ice Age cooling. Present forests are within their natural range of variability but are predicted to shift again to a drier more open structure with increased Pseudotsuga/Larix cover. More frequent stand replacing fires and increased area burned likely will accompany this change due to continued global warming.

J	Sahoo, MM; Swain, JB				Sahoo, Mrunmayee Manjari; Swain, Janaki Ballav			Hydrogeochemical investigation and fluoride levels in lakes: a comprehensive health risk assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												The study investigates the key hydrogeochemical relationships between salts and ions, their spatial distribution, sources of occurrence, and the non-malignant health effects associated with fluoride contamination risk in the lakes of Rajasthan, India, considering a cluster of 18 lakes. The findings highlight the significant influence of both anthropogenic activities and natural lithology on these lakes, which serve as crucial sources of potable and domestic water supply. Water quality parameters such as BOD, pH, Fe, Mn-2(+), PO43-, F-, and HCO3- exceeded the permissible limits set by the WHO. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations, whereas the dissemination of F- resulted in low to moderate correlation at p < 0.005 with TDS (R-2 = 0.37), bicarbonate, HCO3- (R-2 = 0.42), EC (R-2 = 0.3654), Na+ (R-2 = 0.39), Ca2+ (R-2 = 0.49), TH (R-2 = 0.29), Mg2+ (R-2 = 0.45), Al3+ (R-2 = 0.42). The piper diagram showed that the lakes exhibit an alkaline nature, with Ca-HCO3 (68.5%) and Ca-Mg-HCO3 (17.5%) as the dominant hydrogeochemical compositions with high pH, high bicarbonate ions, and elevated levels of Mg-2(+) and SO42- ions. The values of HQI are ranging from 0.34 to 24.67 for infants (age 0-2 years), from 0.22 to 16.67 for children (age 3-11 years), from 0.18 to 12.675 for teenagers (age 12-19 years) and from 0.14 to 11.34 for adults (age 20-65 years). The study area, including regions like Udaipur, Jodhpur, Alwar, Ajmer, and Udaipur, showed that approximately 52% of the population falls within Category F2 (Fluoride concentrations between 0.5 mg/L and 1.5 mg/L).					sahoo, mrunmayee/AAZ-2729-2021; Swain, Janaki Ballav/ADJ-4158-2022														0269-4042	1573-2983				JUL	2025	47	7							252	10.1007/s10653-025-02562-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-025-02562-1								40481963					WOS:001504318800001

Strain S3-1-1T grew in the presence of 1-21% NaCl and at pH 7.0-9.0, with optimum growth at 3% NaCl and pH 7.5. It grew at 16-45 degrees C, with optimum growth at 40 degrees C.Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain S3-1-1T should be placed within the genus Gracilibacillus and formed a separate branch. It exhibited highest similarities to Gracilibacillus ureilyticus MF38T (sequence similarity 97.7%), Gracilibacillus massiliensis Awa-1T (sequence similarity 97.5%), Gracilibacillus xinjiangensis J2T (sequence similarity 97.4%) and Gracilibacillus salitolerans SCU50T (sequence similarity 97.4%). Genomic comparisons revealed that strain S3-1-1T shares closest phylogenetic relationships with Gracilibacillus saliphilus YIM 91119T (ANI 77.4%, AAI 78.4%), Gracilibacillus thailandensis TP2-8T (ANI 77.2%, AAI 78.3%), and Gracilibacillus salitolerans SCU50T (ANI 77.3%, AAI 78.1%). However, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization (19.3-22.1%), average nucleotide identity (71.1-77.4%), and average amino acid identity (66.9-78.6%) values all fell below the recommended thresholds for species delineation, supporting its novel taxonomic status. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, C16:0, iso-C15:0, and anteiso-C17:0. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and aminophospholipids. On the basis of their phenotypic, physiological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, S3-1-1T represented a novel species of the genus Gracilibacillus, for which the name Gracilibacillus pellucidus sp. nov. is proposed, with S3-1-1T (= JCM 36422T = GDMCC 1.4017T) as the type strain.																			0003-6072	1572-9699				MAY	2025	118	5							72	10.1007/s10482-025-02084-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-025-02084-x								40261433					WOS:001472828200002

MERCURY IN LEAF LITTER OF SUBTAIGA FORESTS ON THE NATURAL TERRITORY	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is related to insufficient volume of data on mercury content in soils and components of biosphere in the subtaiga subzone. Leaf litter is an important component of the biological cycle in boreal forests and the source of chemical elements entering the soil. The main aim is to reveal the regularities of mercury distribution in the leaf litter of mixed coniferous-deciduous forests in the natural territory. Object of researches is leaf litter of mixed coniferous-deciduous forests (subtaiga forests) in the natural territory. Methods: selection of trial plots, account for leaf litter, determination of mercury content in leaf litter. Results. The authors have studied mercury content in the leaf litter of the forests of the subtaiga zone under background conditions. The investigations were carried out in the southwestern part of the West Siberian lowland, in the Tarman lake-bog massif system, in the interfluve of the middle course of the Tavda and Tura rivers in the territory of the Tyumen Federal Wildlife Refuge. The leaf litter was taken at the registration sites, differing in the ratio of deciduous and coniferous tree species: birch-pine with a linden forest; fern pine with an admixture of birch; lime-birch forest. The authors determined the regularities of mercury content in leaf litter depending on the species composition of the woody plant-edificators. It is shown that leaf litter of lime-birch forest is characterized by the highest mercury content. The distribution of mercury is determined by the fractions of leaf litter (needles, leaves). Mercury distribution by leaf litter (needles, leaves) fractions is determined. It is shown that mercury content in the leaf litter fraction is higher than that in the coniferous one. The authors calculated mercury amount entering the soils of forest landscapes with leaf fall.

Data about plant community structure and its underground habitat were collected from 64 sample sites in riverside, Gobi, and, lake-basins, while landscape data were collected from the infrared color photo in 1996 from TM satellite and remote sensing image in 1999 and 2000 from America Landsat ETM. At regional scale, we found that vegetation was arranged, for horizontal heterogeneity of its underground habitat, in a two-phase mosaic composed of patches with high plant cover interspersed in a-low-cover matrix. At small scale of vegetation patches, by providing different micro-environments for the root masses of different plant life-forms, vertical heterogeneity of plant underground habitat played a leading role in the, establishment of plant community structure. The root mass zone, of one-year gramineous plant started from ground surface and reached a depth, at 0.4 m, while the one of perennial plant ranged from 0.4 m to 1.0 m in depth. Our results also demonstrated that it was true but rough of attributing patch degradation to the loss of soil resources, and the basic mechanism of patch degradation was the redistribution of water, nutrients and salt in vertical section of plant underground habitat, which resulted in the regressive succession of plant community in patches. For heterogeneity of anti-jamming ability in patches, which came from the heterogeneity of vegetation and its underground habitat, fragmentation of the old patches was the major pattern in the degradation. Wind was presumed as the major driver of patch degradation in Ejina, while the falling of water level caused by exploitation of water resources was presumed as inducement.

J	KRUMHOLZ, LA; COLE, GA				KRUMHOLZ, LA; COLE, GA			STUDIES ON A KENTUCKY KNOBS LAKE .4. SOME LIMNOLOGICAL CONDITIONS DURING AN UNUSUALLY COLD WINTER	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Physical and chemical conditions in Tom Wallace Lake, Kentucky, were studied through three intermittent ice covers for a period of 49 days during January and February 1958. A Birgean heat budget, based on temperatures observed from a station over the deepest part of the basin, involved a loss of 80 g-cal/cm2 for the entire period. However, temperature profiles made from several stations revealed that there was considerable vertical and horizontal turbulence within the water mass beneath the ice, and that isotherms were not horizontal. Although temperatures of the sediment and deep waters fluctuated, the direction of heat flow from the thin layer of profundal sediment was always upward into the overlying one or two meters of water. Most temperature changes at mid depths, especially at 5 m, were probably caused by lateral transport of heat, since vertical thermal gradients were nonexistent or very slight at those levels. The direction of thermal gradients in the uppermost one or two meters beneath the ice was more varied. At times heat seemed to be moving downward from the ice; at other times an inverse gradient was observed even though the upper water was gaining heat. On several days the vertical temperature profile could not be reconciled with the density of water as a function of the prevailing temperatures, and in a few instances these anomalous stratifications could not be correlated with available chemical data. Some relative-density determinations of water from different depths showed on one occasion that there was no instability in spite of an anomalous temperature profile. Freezing-out effects during times of ice formation, and diluting caused by rain and melting were reflected beneath the ice in changing values of total alkalinity, total iron, and total solids. Stratification and variation in values of dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, iron, and total solids are discussed.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1959	4	4					367	385		10.4319/lo.1959.4.4.0367	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1959.4.4.0367													WOS:A1959WY36500001

Here, we investigate an exceptional sedimentary sequence from Lake Chalco, on the SE edge of Mexico City, which provides a perspective on volcanic activity over hundred-thousand-year time scales, and we develop a methodological and analytical protocol applicable to core datasets globally. The lava-dominated base of the sequence (similar to 105 m) is followed by similar to 155 m of lateral-collapse derived deposits and overlain by similar to 295 m of lacustrine sediments containing at least 450 visible tephra fall deposits (TFDs), spanning 400 k.y. These TFDs include 205 events sourced from large-magnitude (predominantly volcanic explosivity index [VEI] >= 5) silicic explosive eruptions, principally from regional polygenetic sources, and 205 deposits from the nearby Sierra Chichinautzin volcanic field (SCVF). A gradual decline in both frequency and apparent magnitude in the silicic eruption record is consistent with the gradual migration of volcanism south along the adjacent Sierra Nevada volcanic range, toward Popocat & eacute;petl. In contrast, the SCVF-derived deposits imply persistent but episodic activity, on time scales of 40-70 k.y., suggesting that the SCVF has been more continuously active than previously recognized. Decoupled trends between the SCVF and regional silicic sources implies that the total magmatic flux is not dictated at the arc scale, or by external (e.g., climatic) drivers, but instead reflects the independent development of individual volcanic systems. The records indicate a minimum long-term frequency of impactful eruptions on Mexico City to be one per 900 years (>1 cm tephra deposited) or 9000 years (>= 10 cm tephra).

Sri Vishnu			Comparative Study on the Optical Properties of Inland Lakes using IOP and AOP Profiler: A Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and QAA Approach	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The inherent optical properties (IOP) and apparent optical properties (AOP) were studied using IOP (AC-S sensor-Seabird Scientific Instrument) and AOP profiler (Satlantic free falling optical profiler) in two different lakes from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The optically active substances, such as total suspended matter (TSM), Secchi disc depth (SDD), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), non-algal particulate matter, and phytoplankton, were analyzed in our research laboratory. The quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) (inversion model)-derived absorption coefficient from AOP profiler measured reflectance was compared with the absorption measured from the AC-S sensor instrument, and the shifting of reference wavelength from 670 to 710 nm was done on the QAA steps for attaining the accuracy of the retrieved dataset. A scatter matrix was developed between the optically active constituents (OACs) to study the association between total absorption coefficient, CDOM, phytoplankton, detritus, TSM, and turbidity. The result shows that the absorption coefficient (1.757-3.649 m(-1)) is high in Vembanad Lake where the chl-a concentration is high (168.37 & mu;g/L). In Kolavai Lake, it is found that chl-a concentration is less (53.96 & mu;g/L) and the absorption coefficient (0.947-2.552 m(-1)). This is high due to its ecological conditions (decaying of macrophytes, houseboat effluent discharges, domestic wastes, etc., causing aquatic ecological imbalances that stimulate the eutrophication level and increase the absorption coefficient at Vembanad Lake). The backscattering coefficient b(bp) decreased with increasing wavelength and had a positive relationship with chl-a in Vembanad Lake and a negative correlation with TSM in Kolavai Lake.

The reduction of the availability of water resources along with the deterioration of water quality could have devastating consequences for human beings and natural environment. Therefore, ensuring the availability, quality and quantity of water resources is a key issue which has attracted the attention of researchers, governments and the public. The construction of dams constitutes a water storage solution in areas suffering from severe water shortage problems. Dams are artificial barriers, constructed across a river in order to hold back the rain water which falls during the wettest months, while a lake or reservoir is being formed behind them. In the current study, we map and monitor the existing water resources within the reservoir of a newly constructed dam during its gradual filling. In that context, we acquired Sentinel-1 radar data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data which are provided free of charge to all users through the Copernicus programme. Our data sets are covering a period of one and a half year, from the completion of the dam construction and the beginning of the reservoir's filling until today, wherein the water level is at the highest point. Sentinel-1 data were processed using random forest classifier and dividing the area into water and land sub-parts, while Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was calculated for Sentinel-2 data. The multi-dated water extents were integrated in an ArcGIS environment in order to evaluate them and investigate if a combined processing of radar and multispectral data of Copernicus programme could be the right choice towards a more accurate and detailed monitoring of water resources in a dam reservoir. Validation of the results has been performed using in situ measurements and observations.

Within 58 days the lake water pH was elevated from 3 to 8. The permanent seepage of acid mine water into the lake was controlled by periodic aftercare treatment keeping the pH in an ecological acceptable range of 6 to 8.5 during the above mentioned period (Konig et al. 2010, Scholz 2011, Zschiedrich 2011). Parallel to the pilot project an intensive monitoring project (OILL - Optimizing In-Lake Liming) was performed to optimize in-lake liming. A major goal of the research project OILL was to utilize wind induced lake currents for distributing lime particles in the lake during application of lime by both vessel and floating pipe systems. Wind speed and direction were constantly monitored and lake currents were traced by drift bodies equipped with GPS buoys. Sediment traps were used to investigate the fall out at the lake's bottom during treatment periods. Air photos based on a remote-controlled quadcopter and depth profile water quality monitoring at 23 points at the lake delivered additional information. These data were used to calibrate the numerical model of lake currents (ELCOM) which can now be utilized as an optimization tool for lake liming. Some needs have been identified with respect to the technology applied. Important aspects regarding navigation tracks and new techniques applying pipe distribution systems for in-lake liming have been identified. Furthermore several commercial available lime products have been tested. First results on investigating the dissolution kinetics of several neutralization products, dissolution inhibitors, and utilization of CO2 to build up the carbonate buffer in the lake water were investigated as well.

We studied the patterns of litter decomposition in lake littoral habitats and investigated whether decay rates, as an integrating proxy for environmental conditions in the sediment, would co-vary with net carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange and methane (CH4) efflux. These gas fluxes are known to be sensitive to environmental conditions. Losses in the mass of cellulose, root, rhizome and moss litter were measured during 2 years in boreal littoral wetlands in Finland and compared with published data on concurrently measured gas fluxes. Four study sites covered a range of sediment types and hydrological conditions. 2. Decomposition was not linearly related to the duration of flooding but depended on sediment type. Readily decomposable litter fractions, such as cellulose and rhizome litter, lost mass at a faster rate in marshes with a longer period of flooding but wide water level fluctuations that hinder establishment of a Sphagnum cover, than in peat-forming fens. In marshes, the mean first-year mass losses were 83-99% and 19-62% for cellulose and rhizomes, respectively. In fens, the respective losses were 40-53% and 33%. In the first year, the loss in the mass of the more recalcitrant root litter did not differ between sites (mean 19-30%) and moss litter lost no mass. 3. The estimated first-year carbon loss from belowground litter was about 0.1-0.3 times ecosystem respiration and roughly similar to net carbon gas (CO2, CH4) efflux, suggesting that vascular plants and recent plant residues contribute substantially to ecosystem release of carbon gases. On the other hand, at least 40% of the mass of the belowground litter remained on a littoral site after the first 2 years of decomposition. Slow decomposition may indicate the accumulation of organic-rich sediments. The accumulated carbon could explain the excess CO2 release found in most littoral sites. In continuously inundated sites decomposition rates were similar to those in periodically flooded sites, but ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange fell to close to zero. This discrepancy implies that the released CO2 is dissolved in water and may be exported into the pelagic zone of the lake.

A Holocene history of high bluffs, strandplains, terraces, and dunes along the southeastern margin of Lake Superior (Michigan, USA) with reference to fluctuating lake levels	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The strandplains of the southeast Lake Superior coastline between Au Sable Point and Whitefish Point, Michigan, USA, record a response to Holocene lake-level variation (-75 m), changing sediment supply, and accommodation space, and are good analogues for future shoreline behaviors associated with water-level changes along lacustrine and marine coastlines. A variety of datasets were used to explore these thick and extensive coastal deposits and to extend further back in time the available relative lake-level curve for the Lake Superior basin. Little is known about the coastal history prior to the Nipissing phase (6-2.8 ka) and what the geomorphic effect was from high rates of water-level rise (-2-4 cm/yr) during the Nipissing transgression (ca. 8-4.5 ka). Rising and peak water levels eroded into glaciofluvial deposits, which resulted in eastward littoral transport of massive amounts of sediment that led to aggradation and basinward progradation of strandplains during the Nipissing transgression and Nipissing phase. Strandplains developed sequentially eastward as discreet littoral cells ending at the large (-88 km2) Whitefish Point strandplain complex. High rates of sediment supply drove a shoreline behavior of depositional transgression and depositional regres sion. In post-Nipissing time, erosion likely continued into glaciofluvial deposits, but falling lake levels likely resulted in decreased sediment supply. With less sediment and less accommodation space, there was an increase in west-to-east longshore sediment transport that contributed to the growth of Whitefish Point during the Algoma (2.8-2.0 ka), Sault (2.0-1.0 ka), and Sub-Sault (1.0 ka to modern) phases. Lake-level rise after 1.0 ka has resulted in retrogradation (erosional transgression) along most of the shoreline between AuSable Point and Whitefish Point.

The record is continuous and has a relatively good age control and high temporal resolution. Reaching a basal age of 62 cal. ka BP, it provides a unique environmental archive for the central Russian Arctic. The results reveal that open landscapes dominated 62.0-50.8 cal. ka BP, but presence of shrubs reflects a relatively warm summer climate. Numerous Pediastrum colonies in the sediments point to a rather low lake stand. A decrease in algae remains in the pollen spectra reflects a higher lake level after c. 50.8 cal.ka BP. From c. 47.8 to 25.5 cal. ka BP, lower contents of Betula and higher percentages of herb pollen point to colder and drier conditions. Besides, larger amounts of Pre-Quaternary palynomorphs and Pediastrum colonies point to increased erosion processes and a lower lake stand. After c. 25.5 cal. ka BP, herb communities further increased. Poaceae and Artemisia show the highest contents between c. 20.3 and 19.2 cal. ka BP, suggesting the coldest and driest climatic conditions during the studied time interval coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Pollen spectra dated c. 19.20-16.05 cal. ka BP reflect a slightly warmer and wetter climate in comparison to the LGM. Increased amounts of coprophilous fungi spores indirectly indicate that grazing animals were abundant around the lake. After c. 16.05 cal. ka BP, increases in shrubs and sedges reflect somewhat warmer and/or wetter conditions. The pollen data also well document the Allerod warming and Younger Dryas cooling events, reflecting an Atlantic influence on the regional climate development during these times. The transition from the Lateglacial to the Holocene at c. 11.63 cal. ka BP is characterized by drastic increases in pollen of shrubs, which document a significant warming. The Early Holocene (c. 11.63-8.30 cal. ka BP) pollen spectra reflect the Holocene Thermal Maximumin the study region. After c. 8.3 cal. ka BP, gradual cooling prevailed and led to climate conditions similar to modern ones at c. 2 cal. ka BP.

Estimating Age and Growth of Largemouth Bass in Southwestern Reservoirs by Using Otoliths and Scales	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Age and growth data are frequently used to monitor and manage important North American sport fishes such as Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides . Continental and regional growth standards have been developed for this species to assess fish growth over time and across space. However, Largemouth Bass age and growth data are infrequently collected in Arizona and the reliability of age estimates derived from typical structures (e.g., scales, otoliths) in the Southwest is uncertain. Our objectives were to 1) compare precision and bias of age estimates from scales with those from otoliths and 2) estimate Largemouth Bass growth in several southwestern warmwater reservoirs by using otoliths. We collected Largemouth Bass from three Arizona reservoirs-Alamo, Pe & ntilde; a Blanca, and Roosevelt-by boat electrofishing in spring 2021. We removed scales and sagittal otoliths from fish and then prepared and independently aged them three times. We compared differences in precision and bias between scales and otoliths using reader agreement percentages, confidence ratings, average coefficients of variation, and age -bias plots. We used age estimates from Largemouth Bass otoliths to calculate mean lengths -at -age at capture and relative growth indices based on published growth standards in each reservoir. Largemouth Bass scale age estimates were less precise, overestimated ages of younger fish, and underestimated age of older fish compared with those of otoliths. Growth was lower in Pe & ntilde; a Blanca Lake than in the other two reservoirs according to mean length -at -age estimates, and relative growth indices suggested that Largemouth Bass growth in all three reservoirs was above average at younger ages, but less so at older ages. The results from this study add to a growing body of literature supporting the use of otoliths for estimating age and growth of Largemouth Bass.

J	ARONSON, RB				ARONSON, RB			LIFE-HISTORY AND DEN ECOLOGY OF OCTOPUS-BRIAREUS ROBSON IN A MARINE LAKE	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Sweetings Pond, a saltwater lake on Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, supported a high-density population of Octopus briareus Robson. Females spawned throughout the year in 1982-83, but spawning peaked in February-March. A number of females spawed early and unsuccessfully in August, 1982. This event was followed in October by a reduction in adult density, and it may have caused late recruitment the following summer. Under natural conditions in Sweetings Pond, O. briareus occupied cavities underneath a variety of benthic formations. In field choice experiments with artificial dens, adult O. briareus displayed minimum cavity length and diameter requirements. Restricted entrances were not preferred, perhaps due to the availability of material with which O. briareus could block their den entrances. A tactile examination of the cavity was important in selection, but visual discrimination was also involved; translucent dens were completely avoided in favor of opaque ones. Certain sponge species were rarely occupied by O. briareus because they lacked sufficient cavity space underneath. When artificial dens were placed underneath these sponges they were occupied. Den defense was examined with a nearest neighbor experiment in which three pairs of artificial dens were placed in a study area. Dens were set 0, 15 and 50 cm apart and the frequency with which both dens of a pair were simultaneously occupied was recorded. The contiguous dens were never simultaneously occupied, whereas the other two pairs were simultaneously occupied with approximately equal frequency. Abundant predatory fishes probably limit Octopus populations off the Eleuthera coast, and the absence of such fishes from Sweetings Pond may account for the high O. briareus density there. Though not subject to interspecific predation, lake O. briareus required the protection of dens due to cannibalism. Only a small minority of benthic formations in the lake were consistently occupied in 1982-83, and enriching areas with artificial dens increased local density. This suggests that dens were limiting in Sweetings Pond. With suitable cavities so widely spaced, den defense probably did not influence density apart from limiting occupation to one octopus per cavity. No Octopus occupied artificial dens in a coastal enrichment experiment, implying that dens were not limiting off the coast.

Therefore, the effect of three Co concentrations on HF in four species in the genera Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum was examined in N-depleted (N was not added) culture. Long-term HF data were also analysed in experimentally fertilised N-limited Lake 227. HF ranges and means at 0.17, 17, and 170 nmol Co/L were 4.1%-5.7% (4.6%), 5.4%-7.4% (6.4%), and 5.9%-9.3% (7.4%), respectively, after 11 days of growth in batch cultures suggesting that Co plays a role in regulating HF. HF at 0.17 nmol/L was significantly different from HF at the two higher concentrations in all species implicating Co in heterocyst differentiation. However, growth rates and final biovolume yields were not significantly affected by Co in any of the species. Applying the ratio of total phosphorus (TP)/Co in culture media (106) at 0.17 nmol Co/L to an N-limited system implies that dissolved Co would have to be less than 1 pmol/L to severely limit HF at 1 mu mol TP/L. This Co concentration is much lower than dissolved Co in Lake 227 during an Aphanizomenon skujae bloom with 1 mu mol TP/L in 2017. Furthermore, Co increased from 0.7 to 2.0 nmol/L simultaneously increasing with HF and cyanobacteria biomass suggesting that Co probably did not limit HF and bloom biomass in Lake 227. Mean summer HFs in Lake 227 during 2000-2020 were 3.4% (epilimnion) and 4.0% (metalimnion), similar to HF at the lowest Co in the cultures. However, HF was significantly higher after 2015 following a shift in dominant bloom species from A. schindlerii to the smaller A. skujae. Calculations suggest that the decrease in cell size may have prompted a higher HF in A. skujae in order to fix an amount of N per unit biomass similar to that fixed by the larger A. schindlerii. Thus, two previously unidentified factors, Co and cell size, can be added to the list of factors that affect HF.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016	Shah, Purnank/0000-0002-2682-9824; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Venkiteswaran, Jason J./0000-0002-6574-7071; Zastepa, Arthur/0000-0003-1292-932X; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2024	69	8					1069	1083		10.1111/fwb.14290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14290		JUN 2024											WOS:001248815800001

A. Livingstone (1955). New insights into the vegetation history of this region are provided by calculations of pollen influx and by the use of linear discriminant analysis to separate Picea glauca and P. mariana pollen. Three major pollen zones are identified: a basal herb zone, characterized by high percentages of Cyperaceae, Gramineae, Salix and Artemisia, and low total pollen influx; a shrub Betula zone with increased total pollen influx and very high percentages of Betula pollen, predominantly in the size range of B. nana and B. glandulosa; and an Alnus zone dominated by Alnus pollen. Lakes currently within the boreal forest or near tree line show relatively high percentages of Picea pollen in the Alnus zone. Several striking vegetation changes occurred between .apprx. 10,000 and 7000 yr B.P. Between .apprx. 11,000 and 10,000 yr B.P., Populus balsamifera pollen percentages as great as 30% indicate that this species was present at low-elevation sites near Walker Lake. These populations declined abruptly .apprx. 10,000 yr ago and have never regained prominence. About 8500 yr B.P., Picea glauca pollen reached 10-15%, indicating the arrival of P. glauca in or near the study area. P. glauca populations evidently decreased .apprx. 8000 yr ago, when Picea pollen percentages and influx fell to low values. About 7000 yr B.P., Alnus pollen percentages and influx rose sharply as alder shrubs became established widely. Picea once more expanded .apprx. 5000 yr ago, but these populations were dominated by P. mariana rather than P. glauca, which increased slowly at this time and may still be advancing northward. Some vegetation changes have been remarkably synchronous over wide areas of interior Alaska, and probably reflect responses of in situ vegetation to environmental changes, but others may reflect the lagged responses of species migrating into new areas.																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1983	20	2					194	214		10.1016/0033-5894(83)90077-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(83)90077-7													WOS:A1983RL70400005
J	Liborio, CHL				Liborio, Carlos H. L.			Multiple Diversity Measures Are Necessary to Represent Biodiversity Patterns of Lentic Communities	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The varying strengths of relationships between diversity measures-be they taxonomic, functional or phylogenetic-imply that biodiversity dimensionality is variable. Understanding these dimensions is essential to discerning how local communities respond to environmental changes. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the dimensionality of biodiversity in lentic systems, (ii) identify the primary measures that differentiate local communities and (iii) test the hypothesis that biodiversity dimensionality is positively correlated with environmental dimensionality. Using a large dataset encompassing phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities from lake ecosystems across the contiguous United States, I calculated Camargo's evenness index based on the eigenvalues from a principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the dimensionality of biodiversity. I also evaluated the degree to which multiple biodiversity dimensions were necessary to describe community patterns. I found that two to three sets of diversity measures were required to adequately capture the biodiversity patterns of plankton and macroinvertebrate communities, respectively. The main measures differentiating local communities were those that included the phylogenetic structure among the taxa. Taxonomic and functional richness also emerged as important variables. The anticipated positive relationship between biodiversity dimensionality and environmental dimensionality was supported for macroinvertebrate communities but not for planktonic groups. This finding suggests that environmental complexity may have distinct impacts depending on the community structure and taxonomic group considered. These study results indirectly suggest that relying on a single measure may cause studies to overlook important responses of biodiversity to environmental gradients. More importantly, in line with previous studies, I found that using only measures based on taxonomic identities falls short in differentiating lentic communities. The feasibility of using measures that require detailed information (e.g., phylogenetic structure) in real-world contexts (e.g., bioassessment) is an issue that should be carefully evaluated in further studies.

J	Landwehr, C; Fulton, M				Landwehr, Cody; Fulton, Mark			Surveying Largemouth Bass Harvest Preferences in Two Small Fishing Impoundments in South Carolina	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												This project used angler survey results to determine Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans harvest preferences, as well as anglers' attitudes toward management in two small fishing impoundments. Our objective was to compare anglers' preferred Largemouth Bass harvest lengths to proportional size distribution (PSD) advised management harvest lengths to provide theoretical management recommendations regarding harvest and predator-prey population dynamics. We collected survey submissions at Lancaster Reservoir and Lake Oliphant in north central South Carolina, questioning anglers regarding harvest preferences, attitude, angling effort, demographic profile, and possible recommendations to fisheries managers. We used Fisher's exact test to compare results between impoundments and Pearson's v2 test to find differences between all submitted responses. Using Kruskal-Wallis tests, we related angling effort to categorical responses. In total, we recorded 82 angler survey submissions. We found no significant differences between impoundments regarding preferred trophy bass length, reason for fishing, regulation support, and whether the angler harvested Largemouth Bass. The majority of anglers at both impoundments responded that they would never harvest Largemouth Bass. We found a significant difference between impoundments regarding targeted species, with the majority (45%) of anglers at Lancaster Reservoir targeting anything that would bite and the majority (53%) of anglers at Lake Oliphant targeting Largemouth Bass. Lancaster Reservoir PSD values aligned with a trophy bass management strategy, whereas Lake Oliphant PSD values fit a balanced management strategy. Anglers' preferences and attitudes showed minimal differences between surveyed impoundments. Survey results suggested inadequate amounts of Largemouth Bass harvest at both impoundments. Although a lack of harvest falls within the management plan for Lancaster Reservoir, it does not for Lake Oliphant, according to prior PSD calculations. Low harvest rates coupled with a PSD score within the balanced management quadrant suggest Lake Oliphant is at risk of becoming bass crowded.																			1944-687X					DEC	2024	15	2								10.3996/JFWM-24-034	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-24-034													WOS:001488839600020

The key to balance the development and protection of transboundary lakes is to properly measure the value of water resources. Most of previous studies on the measurement of lake water resources value have not fully considered the ecosystem service function. This paper proposes a new concept "composite water value" to measure the value of transboundary lakes by integrating the external runoff value and the internal runoff value of water resources. The study constructs a composite water value measurement system for transboundary lakes, further analyzes its influencing factors,and applies the system to the case of Nansi Lake, a representative transboundary lake in eastern China. The results show that: (1) The composite water value of lakes is influenced by various factors, including industrial structure, water withdrawal, and water use methods, which impact the external runoff water value; meanwhile, the composite water quality and fluctuations in lake level are closely associated with the internal runoff water value. From 2008 to 2021, the average annual composite water value of Nansi Lake was 39.628 billion yuan, exhibiting a "rising-falling-fluctuating rising" trend due to pollution control policies, reduced precipitation, and enhanced water-saving technologies successively. (2) From a long-term perspective, it is necessary to focus on the internal runoff water use value of lakes. The internal runoff water value of Nansi Lake has been over 75% of the composite water value, and flood storage and water conservation are important manifestations of its ecosystem service value. (3) The external runoff water value of lake is closely related to the internal runoff water value, and relevant departments need to consider the balance between the water withdrawal of multiple cities along the lake and the retained water volume of the lake to achieve the maximum benefit of composite water value.					; Li, Feifei/C-3476-2017; wang, huimin/AAB-7888-2022; Fang, Zhou/GWU-6891-2022	Fang, Zhou/0000-0002-8441-0810; Xu, Zhili/0009-0001-5740-5549; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				AUG	2024	365								121618	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121618		JUN 2024						38943747					WOS:001262064300001

The lakes were thermally stratified, and the underwater light climate was characterized by extended euphotic zones which included highly illuminated epilimnetic layers (both UVR and PAR) and metalimnia exposed to dim blue-green light. Most of the lakes presented the development of Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) at the metalimnetic layers, near 1% of surface PAR irradiance. Analyzing the fourth-derivative plots of in vivo phytoplankton absorption spectra [d(IV)a(ph)(lambda)], we were able to identify several maxima absorption values attributed to different pigments. Considering lakes with DCM, a significant positive linear relationship was found between d(IV)a(ph) (495-500nm) normalized by chlorophyll a and downward irradiance. Indeed, a negative significant relationship was found between d(IV)a(ph) (495-500nm) normalized by chlorophyll a and diffuse PAR attenuation coefficients. These results point out an increase in the relative concentration of different carotenoids at surface layers indicating the role of photoprotection of these pigments. On the other hand, significant negative linear relationships were found between fourth-derivative spectra normalized by chlorophyll a at 650, 590-595, 560-565 and 520-525nm and downward irradiance. These results indicated an increase in the relative concentration of photosynthetic accessory pigments at deep layers of the euphotic zone. Furthermore, we found a decrease in depth of specific absorption spectra at 440, 670 nm and in the ratio a(ph)* (440 nm) to a(ph)* (670 nm). This pattern was associated with the package effect concept. The increase in relative photosynthetic accessory pigment concentrations and the decrease in values of specific absorption spectra at the bottom of the euphotic zone were attributed to changes in phytoplankton communities between surface and deep layers. These outcomes pointed out that the underwater light climate and temperature water structure are, like in marine systems, very important factors governing the distribution of phytoplanktonic organisms. In addition, the possession of specific photosynthetic. accessory pigments suggests that dominant species in the DCM are well adapted to these dim blue-green light scenarios. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The diverse ostracod assemblage consists of 28 species. The distribution of most of the recorded species in the region today shows that the hydrological conditions at the early-mid Pleistocene transition were not fundamentally different from the modern ones. However, the predominance of Candona neglecta shells in the GBY sequence probably indicates cooler climatic conditions than today. Shells of Candona angulata in the artefact-richer upper half of the sequence suggest a slight salinity increase in the ancient Hula Lake from pure freshwater to slightly oligohaline conditions. This shift probably resulted from wetter conditions and a more stable lake environment with increased residence time of the lake water and stronger influence of evaporation. Shells of the brackish water ostracod Cyprideis torosa and the slightly halophilic Heterocypris sauna and Plesiocypridopsis newtoni were recorded only rarely suggesting that the lake maintained an outlet through the entire period represented by the GBY sequence. Shells of Gomphocythere ortali in GBY cycles 1 and 2 imply that a permanent freshwater stream existed close to the site. Humphcypris subterranea shells in cycles 3-5 provide further evidence that a tributary entered the lake from the south in contrast to the modern setting with the north-south flowing Jordan River at GBY. Statistical analysis of the quantitative ostracod data from GBY identified a group of samples from layers containing more abundant stone artefacts and another group of samples from layers with scarce artefacts. Samples from layers containing more abundant artefacts have relatively high abundances of C. angulata, Darwinula stevensoni and Physocypria kraepelini shells and include rare shells of Ilyocypris hartmanni, Ilyocypris salebrosa, Heterocypris incongniens and Pseudocandona sp. 2 which do not occur in the other samples. The presence of P. kraepelini and H. incongruens shells in artefact-richer sediments possibly indicates poor bottom water oxygenation in the ancient Hula lake sometimes during the periods of Acheulian occupation. However, more detailed studies are required to assess whether lower dissolved oxygen levels in the lake resulted from a slight lake level rise and possibly higher nutrient flux to the lake during wetter conditions or whether hominins already impacted lake's nutrient status by butchering at its shore or by burning of near-shore vegetation.

J	Rosenthal, E; Flexer, A; Möller, P				Rosenthal, Eliyahu; Flexer, Akiva; Moeller, Peter			The paleoenvironment and the evolution of brines in the Jordan-Dead Sea transform and in adjoining areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												One of the most important processes leading to the deterioration of groundwater in Israel is the migration of brines penetrating into fresh groundwater bodies. Such manifestations occur at an ever increasing frequency and in unexpected locations. The hydrochemistry of these processes reveals the possibility of involvement of several types of brines. The distribution and the hydrostratigraphic sequence of the brines is correlated with the evolution of paleoenvironments during the geological history of the region. Several major phases of brine and evaporite formation are discerned: The earliest phase occurred in the Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic (Yam Suf-Ramon-Lower Arad Groups) during which brines were generated by dissolution of evaporites. The second major phase in the evolution of brines occurred during the Mio-Pliocene. In the western areas of the country, the brines were generated mainly by the post-Messinian ingression of seawater which dissolved evaporites and reacted with the invaded rock sequence. In the Rift and in adjoining areas, the dominant brine was the final product of the evaporation of an inland marine lagoon (the Sdom Sea) which penetrated into an environment prevalently built of previously formed rocks and, particularly of clastic beds filling at that time, the nascent rift. From this evaporating lagoon precipitated evaporates, the dissolution of which produced brines. A further step in the hydrochemical evolution in the Rift was the creation of the Lisan Lake, which became progressively saline, probably as the result of dissolution and flushing of salts derived from the previous hypersaline Sdom Sea. The contemporary phase in the Rift is characterized by an ongoing process of flushing-out of residual brines and dissolution of evaporites by currently recharged fresh water. Throughout the geological history of the area, four major periods of flushing stand out. These occurred between the Triassic and the Jurassic, at the end of the Jurassic, as the result of the Oligocene uplift and as part of the Messinian event. As the result of these processes, the rock-sequences were flushed off previously formed brines and evaporites and were "made ready" for following generations of liquids.

J	Whalen, SC; Chalfant, BA; Fischer, EN				Whalen, Stephen C.; Chalfant, Brian A.; Fischer, Eric N.			Epipelic and pelagic primary production in Alaskan Arctic lakes of varying depth	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We compared on eight dates during the ice-free period physicochemical properties and rates of phytoplankton and epipelic primary production in six arctic lakes dominated by soft bottom substrate. Lakes were classified as shallow ((Z) over bar < 2.5 m), intermediate in depth (2.5 m < (Z) over bar 4.5 m), and deep ((Z) over bar > 4.5 m), with each depth category represented by two lakes. Although shallow lakes circulated freely and intermediate and deep lakes stratified thermally for the entire summer, dissolved oxygen concentrations were always >70% of saturation values. Soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NO3 (-)- N + NH4 (+)- N) were consistently below the detection limit (0.05 mu mol l(-1)) in five lakes. However, one lake shallow lake (GTH 99) periodically showed elevated values of DIN (17 mu mol l(-1)), total-P (0.29 mu mol l(-1)), and total-N (33 mu mol l(-1)), suggesting wind- generated sediment resuspension. Due to increased nutrient availability or entrainment of microphytobenthos, GTH 99 showed the highest average volume-based values of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl a) and primary production, which for the six lakes ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 mu g l(-1) and 0.7-3.8 mu mol C l(-1) day(-1). Overall, however, increased (Z) over bar resulted in increased area-based values of phytoplankton chl a and primary production, with mean values for the three lake classes ranging from 3.6 to 6.1 mg chl a m(-2) and 3.2-5.8 mmol C m(-2) day(-1). Average values of epipelic chl a ranged from 131 to 549 mg m(-2) for the three depth classes, but levels were not significantly different due to high spatial variability. However, average epipelic primary production was significantly higher in shallow lakes (12.2 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) than in intermediate and deep lakes (3.4 and 2.4 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)). Total primary production (6.7-15.4 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) and percent contribution of the epipelon (31-66%) were inversely related to mean depth, such that values for both variables were significantly higher in shallow lakes than in intermediate or deep lakes.					; Chalfant, Brian/I-6405-2016	Chalfant, Brian/0000-0002-2562-4691; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2008	614	1					243	257		10.1007/s10750-008-9510-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9510-1													WOS:000259569000021

Annual stocking rates have varied from 317 to 1,027 fingerling (approximately 75 mm) trout per hectare from 1971 to present. Stocking densities can influence angler catch rates but are limited by production constraints and costs associated with raising and transporting fish. By refining fingerling trout stocking densities, managers can optimize the fishery and minimize hatchery expenditures. TO fully Understand the effects of stocking density on angler catch rates in a lake with natural reproduction, we estimated the contribution Of hatchery fish to the fishery by analyzing 6 years of marked fingerling stockings and found that natural recruitment added little to the adult population. We then explored the relationships among stocking densities, angler catch rates, and size of fish harvested by anglers to determine the optimal stocking density needed to achieve our management objectives of catch rates 0.7 fish per hour and 10% of harvested Yellowstone cutthroat trout exceeding 500 mm. We found increased catch rates following years when stocking densities were high. However, mean size of Yellowstone cutthroat trout harvested decreased following years of higher stocking densities. We estimate that approximately 737 fingerling trout per hectare are needed annually to achieve angler catch rates of 0.7 fish per hour. At this stocking density, we estimated that approximately 3% of harvested Yellowstone cutthroat trout would exceed 500 mm. This fell below Our management objective of 10% of harvested Yellowstone cutthroat trout exceeding 500 trim and Suggested that our current catch rate objective and size objective may be incompatible. This information should be combined with angler opinion data to formulate attainable goals for the fishery.

By the time hydrilla was first identified in Lake Conroe in 197 5 (2 years after impoundment), the plant covered 470 acres. By 1979, hydrilla increased to 4,500 acres and was causing problems for boaters, skiers, and swimmers. As a result of efforts by the Lake Conroe Association and its supporters and despite objections by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) staff, the Texas Legislature directed the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and TPWD to conduct a study to determine the ability of grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella to control hydrilla and the effects of hydrilla removal on fish populations, the fishery, and the limnology of the reservoir. Between September 1981 and September 1982, 270,000 diploid grass carp were released into Lake Conroe. By October 1983 hydrilla and all other aquatic vegetation had disappeared from the reservoir. Hydrilla growth was suppressed in Lake Conroe for the next 1.3 years; however, in 1996, approximately 3 acres of hydrilla were discovered. For the next 8 years (1997-2004), herbicide treatments funded primarily by the San Jacinto River Authority (SJRA) and conducted by SJRA and TPWD successfully limited hydrilla expansion. At the same time, native vegetation establishment by TPWD, U.S. Army Engineer Environmental Research and Development Center's Lewisville Aquatic Ecosystem Research Facility, and several angling groups led to diversification and expansion of the native aquatic plant community in Lake Conroe and provided an alternative to a monoculture of hydrilla for fish habitat. However, by 2005, herbicide treatments alone were unable to control hydrilla expansion. As a result, TPWD and SJRA determined the need to develop a comprehensive hydrilla management plan for Lake Conroe. Therefore, a plan based on the principles of Integrated Pest Management was developed with the cooperation of angler organizations, property owner associations, local businesses, and other user groups. The plan integrated use of ecological, biological, chemical, and mechanical strategies for control of hydrilla while promoting diversity of the aquatic plant community. The stated time line of the plan was to reduce the surface coverage of hydrilla at Lake Conroe to less than 40 acres by spring of 2008, while preserving a diverse aquatic plant community.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						247	+																WOS:000263597300017

Frequent extreme droughts in the middle and lower Yangtze River region of China have posed severe ecological and socio-economic dilemmas. The integration of internet-derived, crowdsourced geographic data with remote-sensing imagery now facilitates assessments of these avian habitats. Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater body, suffered an unprecedented drought in 2022, offering a unique case study on avian habitat responses to climate extremes. By harnessing social and online platforms' media reports, we analyzed the types, attributes and proportions of migratory bird habitats. This crowdsourced geographic information, corroborated by Sentinel-2 optical remote-sensing imagery, elucidated the suitability and transformations of these habitats under drought stress. Our findings revealed marked variations in habitat preferences among bird species, largely attributable to divergent feeding ecologies and behavioral patterns. Dominantly, shallow waters emerged as the most favored habitat, succeeded by mudflats and grasslands. Remote-sensing analyses disclosed a stark 60% reduction in optimal habitat area during the drought phase, paralleled by a 1.5-fold increase in unsuitable habitat areas compared to baseline periods. These prime habitats were chiefly localized in Poyang Lake's western sub-lakes. The extreme drought precipitated a drastic contraction in suitable habitat extent and heightened fragmentation. Our study underscores the value of crowdsourced geographic information in assessing habitat suitability for migratory birds. Retaining sub-lake water surfaces within large river or lake floodplains during extreme droughts emerges as a key strategy to buffer the impacts of hydrological extremes on avian habitats. This research contributes to refining conservation strategies and promoting adaptive management practices of wetlands in the face of climate change.																				2073-445X				JUN 9	2025	14	6							1236	10.3390/land14061236	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land14061236													WOS:001516768300001
J	MacKay, MD				MacKay, Murray D.			Ice Concentration Scaling Laws for Freshwater Lakes in Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												If lake ice is assumed to deform and fail as a linear viscoelastic material under the action of wind stress, then a simple ice concentration scaling law can be constructed suitable for one-dimensional lake models embedded within environmental prediction systems. Most 1-D lake models assume no ice mechanics at all, while others adapt the viscous-plastic rheology common in ice-ocean models for the purpose of estimating ice fraction. Elastic buckling is generally disregarded as a significant failure mechanism in ice under low stress conditions at geophysical scales. However, by adding viscosity to the constitutive equation, the conditions for viscoelastic buckling seem quite plausible over a wide range of lake size and ice thickness. An ice concentration scaling law based on this process is evaluated here in multiannual simulations over North America and found to produce superior ice phenology statistics compared with simulations based on plastic failure or no ice mechanics. Plain Language Summary Most mid- and high-latitude lakes experience periods of partial ice cover (i.e., ice concentration < 100%) during early winter. While very small lakes might freeze solid in a single night under calm conditions, larger lakes may take days or weeks to completely freeze because wind stress continually breaks the ice cover resulting in patches of open water. The extent of wintertime open water is very important for both lake ecology and for regional weather conditions (e.g., lake-effect snowstorms). Many weather and climate models employ one-dimensional lake models that do not represent fractional ice cover at all, or parameterize it based on mechanical ideas from sea ice models, resulting in poor timing and duration of simulated ice cover. Here we propose a new scheme based on different mechanics that improves these simulated features.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2023	50	12							e2023GL103713	10.1029/2023GL103713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103713													WOS:001058648500003

Researches have been carried out to find new sources of gluten-free food; among them, the cattail (Typha spp) can be counted. It is possible to grind its rhizomes and to get a baking flour to make cakes, bread, and biscuits. The objective of the study was to determine the content of gluten fraction in the flour produced from rhizomes of the narrow-leaved cattail that caused a disease response in persons with the celiac disease. The experimental material comprised rhizomes of the narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia), harvested in three water reservoirs during the winter period (January 2009), i.e. in a pond in the Zielonka Forest (the Province of Wielkopolska), in a lake and a fish breeding pond in Osieczna (near Leszno). The test for gluten was conducted by means of immunoassay methods using the products from an R-Biopharm Company: Cocktail Solution (R) and Ridascreen gliadin kit (R) Gliadin R7001 (AOAC 120601). The content of total protein was determined by a Kjeldahl method using a Foss Tecator apparatus. The content of Gliadin protein in the extracts was determined photometrically using a Bradford reagent. Based on the results obtained, it was found that the flour from rhizomes of the narrow-leaved cattail did not contain any peptides that caused celiac disease. Thus, this flour can be used in the products for people suffering from this disease. The content of total protein in the flour varied depending on the place where the plants were harvested. The content of the protein fraction in the flour extracts produced from rhizomes of the narrow-leaved cattail was not correlated with the content of total protein in the flour alone.					; Piasecka-Kwiatkowska, Dorota/AFI-1274-2022	Dziedzic, Krzysztof/0000-0003-1282-7446; Piasecka-Kwiatkowska, Dorota/0000-0002-4848-6957; 													1425-6959						2010	17	5					85	92																WOS:000285946600009

Phyllosilicates were not observed in the matrix. Refractory inclusions are rare (0.3 vol%) and are spinel pyroxene aggregates or amoeboid olivine aggregates; melilite is absent from the refractory inclusions. Sahara 00182 contains predominantly type 1 PO chondrules, POP chondrules are less common. Most chondrules contain blebs of, and are often rimmed with, Fe-Ni metal and sulfide. Chondrule phenocrysts are magnesium-rich (Fo(92.2 +/- 0.6), n = 129; Fs(4.4 +/- 1.8) Wo(1.3 +/- 1.1), n = 16). Matrix comprises similar to30 vol% of the meteorite and is predominantly sub-micron silicates, with rare larger silicate gains. Matrix Fe-Ni metal (mean Ni = 5.8 wt%) and sulfide grains are up to mm scale. No phyllosilicates were observed in the matrix. Refractory inclusions are rare (1.1 vol%) and melilite is absent. The oxygen isotope composition of NWA 1152 falls within the range of the CV chondrites with delta(17)O = -3.43parts per thousand delta(18)O = 0.70parts per thousand and is similar to Sahara 00182, delta(17)O = -3.89parts per thousand, delta(18)O = -0.19parts per thousand (Grossman and Zipfel 2001). Based on mineralogical and petrographic characteristics, we suggest NWA 1152 and Sahara 00182 show many similarities with the CR chondrites, however, oxygen isotopes suggest affinity with the CVs. Thus, neither sample can be assigned to any of the currently known carbonaceous chondrite groups based on traditionally recognized characteristics. Both samples demonstrate the complexity of inter- and intra-group relationships of the carbonaceous chondrites. Whatever their classification, NWA 1152 and Sahara 00182 represent a source of relatively pristine solar system material.

C	Wolfe, JE; Cardwell, MW		Castronovo, JP; Clark, JA		Wolfe, JE; Cardwell, MW			Soap lake siphon receives rehabilitation	PIPELINES IN THE CONSTRUCTED ENVIRONMENT					1998 Pipeline Division Conference, in Conjunction with the Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) Users Forum on Pipelines in the Constructed Environment	AUG 23-27, 1998	SAN DIEGO, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Pipeline Div				Advancement in the state-of-the-art of the application of cement mortar to the surface of large diameter circular steel surfaces had progressed considerably in the past few years. The process described in this article gives confidence once again for large diameter applications. The Soap Lake Siphon is one of the most important features of the West Canal, part of the Columbia Basin Project in central Washington. It is being rehabilitated in the winter of 1997-1998. This project is unique and challenging for several reasons, as follows. First, with a 22' 4 " internal diameter, this was the largest steel-lined concrete pipe ever constructed when the siphon was built in 1947-1948. It is quite possibly still the largest of its kind even today. Second, the siphon is 8250' long. Also the alignment and profile of the pipeline varies along its length. It reaches its lowest point, 250' below the intake, in the middle. Finally, there are two short, steep slopes which achieve an 18% grade. The first part of the rehabilitation consists of removing all remnants of the original, hand-dobbed, coal-tar enamel coating. Some of this had deteriorated and exposed the steel liner plate, causing tuberculation. A cement mortar lining 3/4 " thick will provide the new protection to the steel surface. The challenge lies in applying the new lining under such unique conditions. The only project remotely similar in terms of the distance the mortar needs to be projected and trowelled was one completed 25 years ago on a pipe diameter almost as large with a less-difficult profile. This project uniquely demonstrates the capabilities of the in-place mortar lining process. Cement mortar is being applied to a surface never before attempted in unprecedented conditions. This paper fully details the role of this application process in the siphon's overall rehabilitation.																					0-7844-0372-4				1998							566	574																WOS:000081694700060

Tracing groundwater salinization processes in coastal aquifers: a hydrogeochemical and isotopic approach in the Na-Cl brackish waters of northwestern Sardinia, Italy	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Throughout the Mediterranean, salinization threatens water quality, especially in coastal areas. This salinization is the result of concomitant processes related to both seawater intrusion and water-rock interaction, which in some cases are virtually indistinguishable. In the Nurra region of northwestern Sardinia, recent salinization related to marine water intrusion has been caused by aquifer exploitation. However, the geology of this region records a long history from the Palaeozoic to the Quaternary, and is structurally complex and comprises a wide variety of lithologies, including Triassic evaporites. Determining the origin of the saline component of the Jurassic and Triassic aquifers in the Nurra region may provide a useful and more general model for salinization processes in the Mediterranean area, where the occurrence of evaporitic rocks in coastal aquifers is a common feature. In addition, due to intensive human activity and recent climatic change, the Nurra has become vulnerable to desertification and, in common with other Mediterranean islands, surface water resources periodically suffer from severe shortages. With this in mind, we report new data regarding brackish and surface waters (outcrop and lake samples) of the Na-Cl type from the Nurra region, including major ions and selected trace elements (B, Br, I, and Sr), in addition to isotopic data including delta O-18, delta D in water, and delta S-34 and delta O-18 in dissolved SO4. To identify the origin of the salinity more precisely, we also analysed the mineralogical and isotopic composition of Triassic evaporites. The brackish waters have Cl contents of up to 2025 mg L-1, and the ratios between dissolved ions and Cl, with the exception of the Br/Cl ratio, are not those expected on the basis of simple mixing between rainwater and seawater. The delta O-18 and delta D data indicate that most of the waters fall between the regional meteoric water line and the global meteoric water line, supporting the conclusion that they are meteoric in origin. A significant consequence of the meteoric origin of the Na-Cl-type water studied here is that the Br/Cl ratio, extensively used to assess the origin of salinity in fresh water, should be used with care in carbonate aquifers that are near the coast. Overall, delta S-34 and delta O-18 levels in dissolved SO4 suggest that water-rock interaction is responsible for the Na-Cl brackish composition of the water hosted by the Jurassic and Triassic aquifers of the Nurra, and this is consistent with the geology and lithological features of the study area. Evaporite dissolution may also explain the high Cl content, as halite was detected within the gypsum deposits. Finally, these Na-Cl brackish waters are undersaturated with respect to the more soluble salts, implying that in a climate evolving toward semi-arid conditions, the salinization process could intensify dramatically in the near future.					paternoster, michele/L-4636-2016; Sinisi, Rosa/OKT-1782-2025; Oggiano, Giacomo/A-9397-2010; Paternoster, Michele/L-4636-2016	MONGELLI, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-8411-2154; Oggiano, Giacomo/0000-0003-1236-1498; Sinisi, Rosa/0000-0003-4439-3419; Paternoster, Michele/0000-0003-0212-0949													1027-5606	1607-7938					2013	17	7					2917	2928		10.5194/hess-17-2917-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-17-2917-2013													WOS:000322376000036

However, little is known about the initial sources and controlling factors of the ground ice in the SAYR. In this study, for the first time, ground ice stable isotope data (delta O-18, dD, and d-excess) are presented, along with cryostratigraphic information for nine sites is integrated into three cryostratigraphic units (palsa, thermo-gully, and lake-affected sites) in the central SAYR. The ground ice in the nine sites exhibited diverse structures, ice contents, and stable isotopes due to differences in the initial water sources, ice formation mechanisms, soil types, and climate conditions. All of the freezing lines of ground ice are below those of the precipitation, streams, and lakes in most cases, suggesting the freezing of liquid water. The near-surface ground ice (NSGI) originated from precipitation, active layer water, and precipitation-fed springs. The NSGI was formed by quick freezing at the thermo-gully site (TG-1). In contrast, the formation of the NSGI at the palsa site (Palsa-1) experienced a slow segregation process during the permafrost aggradation. The NSGI was formed by quick freezing at the lake-affected sites under colder climate conditions. Conversely, the deep-layer ground ice (DLGI) at the lake-affected sites was fed by isotopically negative water and lake water occurred during a colder climate period. The DLGI at the TG-1 and Palsa-1 formed via similarly slowsegregation of supra-permafrost water (mixed with precipitation), but had opposite watermigration directions. The stable isotope compositions of the DLGI at the lake-affected sites became gradually more positive with decreasing distance from WL Lake, emphasizing the large influence of the lake changes on the growth of ice. The two end-member mixing model estimated that the contributions of paleo-lake water to the DLGI ranged from 9.8 % to 63.4 % towards the lake at the lake-affected sites, while the meltwater from past permafrost/ground ice contributed 36.6-90.2 % of the total input. A conceptual diagram of the delta O-18 trajectories of ground ice was constructed, the water migration patterns and ground ice formation processes between the palsa, thermo-gully, and lake-affected sites were clarified. The results of this study emphasize the influence of lake changes and past permafrost evolution on ground ice growth and improve our understanding of permafrost changes on the QTP.

J	PARKER, RA				PARKER, RA			SOME EFFECTS OF THINNING ON A POPULATION OF FISHES	ECOLOGY												Flora Lake, a 41.3-ha body of water in Vilas County, Wisconsin, was the site of a 5-year program begun in 1952 in which the density of fishes was reduced primarily with fyke nets in an attempt to increase the growth rate of important fish species. Annual quantities removed ranged up to 1125.6 kg, or 52.5% of the catchable standing crop at the time of the estimation of the population in early summer. A 2d-degree polynomial was fitted to the data on calculated total length at each year of life before 1952, based upon scale analyses. Appropriate confidence intervals about these pre-treatment growth curves were used to distinguish significant changes in the rate of growth from "normal" fluctuations. The covariance technique was employed to test for differences between adjusted, mean weights of specimens collected in 1952 and in 1956. No important change occurred in the growth rate in length of largemouth bass; however, individuals were heavier at the over-all mean length in 1956 than in 1952. Furthermore, the estimated total weight of bass over 130 mm in length rose from 4.3 to 6.8 kg/ha, and the yield to anglers increased from 15.4 kg in 1952 to 65.9 kg in 1955, although the effort remained nearly constant. The 1953 and 1954 year classes of bluegills, pumpkinseeds, and hybrids of these 2 species responded favorably in growth rate, as did some year-classes of rock bass and common white suckers. No increase could be detected in the growth of golden shiners, and yellow perch showed a marked decrease. In addition to the largemouth bass, the pumpkinseeds and suckers had a higher adjusted mean weight in 1956 than in 1952. No difference could be demonstrated for bluegills, hybrids, and rock whereas perch and golden shiners were considerably thinner.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1958	39	2					304	317		10.2307/1931876	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931876													WOS:A1958WR62900015
J	Harris, AJL; Wright, R; Flynn, LP				Harris, AJL; Wright, R; Flynn, LP			Remote monitoring of Mount Erebus volcano, Antarctica, using polar orbiters: Progress and prospects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					5th Circumpolar Remote Sensing Symposium	JUN 22-25, 1998	DUNDEE, SCOTLAND					Mount Erebus (Antarctica) is a remote and inhospitable volcano, where field campaigns are possible only during the austral summer. In addition to continuously monitoring seismic instruments and video cameras, data from scanners flown aboard polar orbiting space-craft, such as the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), can contribute to continuous, year-round monitoring of this volcano. Together these data allow measurement of the temperature of, thermal and gas flux from, and mass flux to a persistently active lava lake at Erebus' summit. The monitoring potential of such polar-orbiting instruments is enhanced by the poleward convergence of sub-spacecraft ground-tracks at the Erebus latitudes, permitting more frequent return periods than at the equator. Ground-based observations show that the Erebus lava lake was active with an area of similar to 2800 m(2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) flux of (230 +/- 90) t d(-1) prior to September 1984. AVHRR-based lake area and SO2 flux estimates are in good agreement with these measurements, giving (2320 +/- 1200) m(2) and (190 +/- 100) t d(-1), respectively, during 1980. However during late-1984 the lava lake became buried, with TM data showing re-establishment of the lake, with a TM-derived surface temperature of 578-903 degrees C, by January 1985. Following these events, ground-based lake area and SO2 flux measurements show that the lake area and SO2 flux was lower (180-630 m(2) and 9-91 t d(-1), respectively). This is matched by a decline in the AVHRR- and TM-derived rate of magma supply to the lake from 330 +/- 167 kg s(-1) prior to 1984 to 30-76 kg s(-1) thereafter. Clearly, a reduction in magma supply to, and activity at, the lava lake occurred during 1984. We look forward to using data from such future polar-orbiting sensors as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AASTR) to contribute to high (> once a day) temporal resolution measurement and monitoring of activity at this volcano. Such analyses will in turn contribute to a more complete understanding of how this volcano works.																			0143-1161					OCT 15	1999	20	15-16					3051	3071		10.1080/014311699211615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/014311699211615													WOS:000082768800010

Trends in the hydrochemistry of acid-sensitive surface waters in the UK 1988-2008	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We conducted complementary linear and non-linear statistical modelling of the first 20 years of hydrochemical data from the 22 lakes and streams of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN) in order to assess temporal patterns and rates of change in indicators of the key drivers of surface water acidification and acidity status. Over the period 1988-2008, concentrations of non-marine sulphate (i.e. of anthropogenic origin) fell in line with reductions in non-marine sulphur deposition, the principal driver of acidification. Most of the decline was confined to the latter half of the 1990s. Whilst these reductions were substantial, concentrations in recent samples from the most contaminated sites remained several times higher than those in the most remote, low-deposition regions. Nitrate (NO3-) concentrations also declined slightly at several sites in northern England and Wales, possibly reflecting a recent regional reduction in N deposition. Further north, NO3- concentrations increased slightly in some Scottish sites, reflecting a continued dominance of climatic variation on nitrogen cycling in this region. A combination of unusually high rainfall and seasalt inputs in the early years, gradual long-term reductions in hydrochloric acid deposition, and later and more substantial reductions in sulphur deposition, appeared to account for relatively linear increases in an alkalinity-based estimate of Acid Neutralising Capacity ([AB-ANC]) with time. However, variation between sites in the size of the long-term trend in [AB-ANC] was most clearly linked to the size of the long-term reduction in sulphate concentration. The chemical characteristics of changes in [AB-ANC] across the network were dependent on rates of change in acid deposition, the extent to which sites have previously acidified, and average dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]). In the most acidified waters, the response in acidity to reductions in acid deposition was dominated initially by large reductions in inorganic aluminium concentrations ([Al-inorg]. Responses in pH have become clearer at these sites as [Al-inorg] has begun to stabilise. Over the wider network, pH has been rising more rapidly in sites with lower concentrations of organic acids. A substantial proportion of the deposition-driven increase in [AB-ANC] at several sites is accounted for by increases in [DOC]. For the non-acidified but acid-sensitive waters in the far north and west, changes in [DOC] represent the only clear response to the small changes in sulphur deposition. In the more acidified sites, a reduction in the size of occasional extreme concentrations of Al-inorg, that occur after periods of high rainfall or seasalt deposition events, has been more rapid than the declines in average levels, implying that at most sites the persistence of these events should not be seen as an additional barrier to ecological recovery. In a comparison of geographically paired sites with forested and moorland catchments, consistently higher levels of inorganic aluminium concentration and lower AB-ANC provided clear evidence that the former group had acidified to a greater extent. There were few significant differences in the rate at which non-marine sulphate concentration declined or AB-ANC increased and the forested sites therefore remain in a more acidified condition.

The ranges of delta N-15 values from the two lakes are similar, varying from +2.8 parts per thousand to +6.7 parts per thousand, The high values of delta N-15 (around +6 parts per thousand) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5-19 cal ka BP) indicate that a larger fraction of the available nitrate in both lakes was utilised by phytoplankton. A cool and dry climate during the LGM may have limited the input of terrestrial nitrate, resulting in the use of a large fraction of the nitrate, and low productivity, in both lakes. The use of a smaller fraction of the nitrate by phytoplankton in both lakes after the LGM (19-12 cal ka BP) is reflected in the lower delta N-15 values (down to +3.0 parts per thousand). The increase in summer insolation after the LGM caused increased vertical mixing of the lake water column, which transported nitrate upwards from the deeper waters and into the photic zone. The reduced rate of nitrogen consumption after the LGM indicates that nitrate was more readily available to phytoplankton at this time and did not limit their activities. This change suggests that other factors limited phytoplankton activity during this period. At the climatic transition between Oxygen Isotope Stages 2 and 1 (around 11.5 cal ka BP), the rapid increase in delta N-15 (from +3.0 parts per thousand to +6.0 parts per thousand) reflected a rapid increase in nitrate utilization. At this transition, increases in precipitation and lake levels, which were associated with the increased intensity of the East Asian Monsoon, may have brought a large influx of nutrients required by the phytoplankton into the lakes from the watershed. This hydrological change led to increased phytoplankton activity in both lakes, resulting in increased nitrate consumption. The delta N-15 data obtained here from the sediments of lakes Baikal and Hovsgol suggest that the nitrogen cycle in the Siberian region is strongly linked to hydrological changes across the Asian continent, which are related to global climate change.

The nearshore aquatic environment of eastern Lake Erie: A thirty-year perspective from a monitoring station	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Dreissenid mussels arrived at the Waverly Shoal located above the inflow of the Niagara River in 1989, initiating marked changes in the water and sediment chemistry, and benthic invertebrate community composition at an Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks monitoring station. Here we examine change in the nearshore of eastern Lake Erie until 2019, inferred from monitoring at this station. Dreissenid numbers peaked in 1991, exceeding 200,000 individual m-2, and remained above 20,000 individual m-2 until 2004 after which numbers progressively declined. In 1993, the population transitioned from mixed Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis, to D. bugensis in subsequent years. The decrease in particle size and increase in organic content of surficial sediment which began the year after mussel arrival has persisted until present time. The low concentrations of trace metals and PAHs at the station increased slightly after the physical alteration in bed sediments and has either not changed or declined. After an initial increase in Secchi depth, water clarity changed little over post invasion years, with prevailing moderate water clarity interspersed with periods of bed resuspension and high turbidity. Calcium concentration in the water column, which fell dramatically after the arrival of dreissenids, has gradually increased in recent years. Chlorophyll a and total phosphorus levels indicating oligo-mesotrophic conditions have not varied systematically over the years, other than a modest decline in chlorophyll a after dreissenid arrival. Benthic invertebrate assemblages have gone through multiple alterations, with shifting abundance of amphipods, oligochaetes, chironomids, gastropods and sphaeriids attributed to invasive species rather than the physical environment. Collectively, the data suggests the nearshore ecosystem has shifted in benthic productivity and trophic transfers mediated by the benthos and invasive species, with water and sediment quality appearing to not vary beyond the range driven by inherently fluctuating physical conditions.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2024	27	1					64	84		10.14321/aehm.027.01.64	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.027.01.64													WOS:001326942900006

U-Pb age and Hf-isotope geochemistry of zircon from felsic volcanic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Aillik Group, Makkovik Province, Labrador	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												U-Pb zircon SHRIMP geochronology and Lu-Hf zircon LA-MC-ICPMS isotope geochemistry are used to constrain the ages of Paleoproterozoic felsic magmatism and their crustal sources in the Aillik Group, Makkovik Province of Labrador. This information is important for understanding the extent of crustal reworking vs. juvenile crustal growth in subduction-related magmatism during the Paleoproterozoic and improves framework knowledge for uranium exploration in the Central Mineral Belt of Labrador. U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronology from four felsic tuff samples collected from two different areas of the Aillik Group yield magmatic Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 1852 +/- 7 Ma (2 sigma), 1854 +/- 7 Ma (2 sigma), 1861 +/- 7 Ma (2 sigma), and 1862 +/- 7 Ma (2 sigma.). The ages fall within the range of previous U-Pb zircon dates reported for felsic volcanic rocks of the Aillik Group. Altogether these dates indicate that felsic volcanism spanned at least 30 m.y. and was perhaps most intense during the last 10 m.y. of that interval. A foliated syn-deformational monzogranite in the Aillik Group (Cross Lake granite) yields a Pb-207/Pb-206 zircon date of 1805 +/- 6 Ma (2 sigma), which indicates that development of a pervasive planar fabric associated with northwestward thrusting of the Aillik Group continued after this time. Initial epsilon Hf-s(t) values for magmatic zircons from the four felsic tuffs (-4.8 to -1.9, -1.7 to +2.2, -11.8 to +3.8, -9.0 to -4.6) and monzogranite (-4.8 to -1.5) exhibit significant variability, which indicates heterogeneous sources. Most of the zircon grains have negative initial epsilon Hf-s(t) values and calculated crust formation Hf-isotope T-DM model ages point to substantial contributions from melts of ancient crust, ranging in age from ca. 2200 to 2900 m.y. and clustering at ca. 2500 m.y. Inherited zircon grains in the felsic tuffs and monzogranite, mainly have U-Pb ages of ca. 1880-1920 Ma, though others are older, up to ca. 2743 Ma. Hf-isotope T-DM model ages for the inherited zircons are similar to those of the magmatic zircons. The Hf-isotope results indicate that subduction-related felsic magmatism in the Makkovik Orogen involved significant crustal reworking (similar to 80%) during formation of the Aillik Group.

We combine these chronological data with a regional map of the glacial geomorphology to hypothesize key events in the glacial history from around 14 ka to present. Our reconstruction shows that, following deglaciation of the main ice sheet across central Troms and Finnmark, mountain glaciers were terminating on land, close to the coast, between around 12.1 and 10.6 ka. Continued recession of the main Fennoscandian Ice Sheet margin towards the SE led to the isolation of several large plateau icefields and outlet glaciers that generated moraines at around 10.2-9.2 ka, which we ascribe to the Erdalen Event, and 8.4-8.2 ka, which is broadly contemporaneous with the 8.2 ka cold event. Although the latter corresponds with the Scandinavian Finse Event, very few moraines have been dated to this time and we therefore view it as a tentative hypothesis for future work to test. During the Holocene Thermal Maximum (similar to 6.6 to 6.3 ka) most (if not all) glaciers in the region disappeared, but then regrew during the Neoglaciation and produced large moraines dated to around 4.7 ka that lie a few hundred metres distal to the prominent Little Ice Age moraines (previously dated to AD 1810s-1870s). Given the limitations of our dating approach, the preservation of moraines dated to this period in northern Norway also warrants further investigation. We also highlight that terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating of the moraines is not consistent with other dating approaches and the widely established deglaciation history of the region, probably owing to cosmogenic inheritance and insufficient glacial erosion.

Sediment cores were collected at three sampling stations in the west basin of the lake on a transect from the Slave River delta to the outlet of the Mackenzie River. The geochemical composition of the sediments showed the deposition of similar material at all sampling stations. Sediment dating indicated a very high sedimentation rate (46.6 g.cm-2 per year) at a 110 m water depth in the vicinity of the Slave River delta and mixing of bottom sediments at the southwestern part of the lake. The concentrations of trace elements (Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, V, Pb and Zn) were uniform in all sediment profiles. However, surficial sediments were enriched by arsenic. Canadian standard CLB-1 containing 51 PCB congeners was used in the determination of PCBs in the sediment. Thirty-three PCB congeners were detected and their concentrations determined in selected sections of sediment cores. The most abundant congeners were 15 and 18, 44, 49, 52 and 101 (IUPAC numbering) with maximum concentrations 3.52, 2.68, 2.44, 6.20 and 2.13 ng.g-1 respectively. The concentration pattern of PCBs in Great Slave Lake sediments indicated considerably greater quantities of lower than higher chlorinated biphenyls. Several congeners, particularly those having 7-10 chlorine atoms, were determined in concentrations smaller than 0.20 ng.g-1 only at one sediment depth. Hexachlorobutadiene, 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, pentachlorobenzene, A-HCH, hexachlorobenzene, pentachloroanisol and A-chlordane were present at all stations at different sediment depths. Maximum concentrations of the 16 chlorinated hydrocarbons analyzed in Great Slave Lake sediments were between 0.08 and 1.04 ng.g-1. The concentrations of PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons were about two orders of magnitude lower than those in Lake Ontario sediments.																			0004-0843					MAR	1992	45	1					10	19																WOS:A1992HM08400003
J	Toft, C; Elliott-Fisk, D				Toft, C; Elliott-Fisk, D			Patterns of vegetation along a spatiotemporal gradient on shoreline strands of a desert basin lake	PLANT ECOLOGY												Shoreline strands of Mono Lake, California, show clear evidence of regular temporal change in plant communities and the soils associated with them along a primary successional sere, contradicting the traditional notion that succession sensu stricto does not occur in arid environments. We documented spatial patterns, and inferred temporal patterns from aerial photographs taken each decade from 1930, in communities of perennial shrubs and in characteristics of the physical environment in sand-dune and shoreline ecosystems on the north shore of Mono Lake, a receding terminal Quaternary lake in the Great Basin desert of the United States that is highly saline and alkaline. Our study plot was aligned with an extreme physicochemical gradient, representing a primary sere beginning with the historic, accelerated regression of Mono Lake since 1940 and ending with upland surfaces exposed by lake regression between 500 and 1000 years ago. Four shrub species composed most of the 7-11% percent cover of perennial vegetation: populations of Sarcobatus vermiculatus extended farthest toward the lake and colonized the most recently exposed and toxic surfaces; populations of Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Tetradymia tetrameres, and C. viscidiflorus ended at increasing distances (in this order) from the lake shore, reflecting each species' respectively lower tolerance of soil salinity, alkalinity, and toxic soil elements rather than the ability to disperse. Values of soil variables that decrease plant growth and establishment (EC, pH, B, S) were lower in older substrates, in the upper soil horizons, and at increasing distances from the lake, reflecting leaching and other pedogenic processes with time. Individuals of S. vermiculatus appeared to promote dune building by tolerating burial, enhancing their own growth and establishment, and catching more sand. We hypothesize that this process also facilitates the establishment of less stress tolerant species. Plant nutrients (N, P) decreased with depth, evidence of progressive soil enrichment by litter and leaf fall. Thus both allogenic processes (weathering of parent material) and autogenic processes (facilitation in particular) resulting from plant-environment interactions occurred and contributed to ecosystem change in this extreme primary sere, adhering to the strictest definition of succession.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				JAN	2002	158	1					21	39		10.1023/A:1014766100615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014766100615													WOS:000174492100003

Systematic field investigation showed that the nests were concentrated exclusively in a narrow and shallow area upstream of the dam. The abundance of tamarisk is a determining factor in the breeding success of the Western Marsh Harrier at this site, by supporting the nests and giving them some protection from predation while the birds are close to agricultural fields, a favourable hunting ground. A study of individual broods revealed a relatively small clutch size (3.5 eggs per nest) and that incubation took 32 days on average. Compared with previous reports for this species elsewhere, the chicks fledged relatively early (33 or 35 days), but with a low fledgling success rate not exceeding 33.9%. The low fledgling success is partly attributable to the structure of the habitat, as the dense dry vegetation above the water level limits the movement of chicks out of nests yet favours the drowning of those that fall from the nest. Breeding success is influenced by a reduction in hunting territory caused by drops in the water level during periods of drought, poor climate conditions, and disturbance caused by human activities in the reservoir lake and riparian farmland. In addition to these environmental factors, nest failure due to nest destruction is related to the experience of the pairs in choosing the nesting site and their ability to weave the nest-building materials. Further study is needed on the characteristics of this highly specific habitat and its state of conservation, the reproduction of coexisting bird populations, and human activities around the breeding site.

Lacustrine record of high magnitude flood events and climate variability during mid to late Holocene in the semiarid alluvial plains, western India	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Long-term data on flooding events are necessary for understanding the flood frequency and magnitude variations, but the available instrumental records span only a few decades. Recently, lake sediment sequences have emerged as a relatively untapped archive for high-magnitude floods over longer timescales. In the present study, multi-proxy data from a lacustrine sequence at Timbi in the Dhadhar river basin were analysed to determine high magnitude floods in this semi-arid region of western India in response to southwest monsoon variability. The results indicate the occurrence of discreet high magnitude flood events and depositional phases corresponding to different climatic conditions during the mid to late Holocene. Three large flash floods between 4830 and 2730 cal yr B.P. (Phase-I) have been identified as coeval with flood events from fluvial archives and correlated to the widespread period of aridity and weak monsoon recorded in the lakes of north western India. A shift in the depositional environment from fluvial to lacustrine occurred around 2730 cal yr B.P. as inferred from an abrupt change in the sediment character and palynofacies caused by high intensity flash floods and high sediment influx. Phase II (2730-1730 cal yr B.P.) was marked by periodic erosion and deposition in the catchment and sediment influx during pulses of higher precipitation as evident in the dominance of Glomus sp. and Alternaria sp., and relatively low values in concentration-related magnetic parameters and S-Ratio. A high magnitude flood event occurred at 1770 cal yr B.P. towards the end of phase II. During phase III (1730-880 cal yr B.P.) the monsoon was enhanced and climate was warmer as suggested by low chi fd%, SIRM/chi, S-Ratio, higher Ba/Sr ratio and presence of aquatic palynomorphs. A high percentage of structured Organic Matter (OM), low fungal remains and increased Ba/Sr ratios between 880 and 360 cal yr B.P. indicate higher lake waters and better monsoon condition during phase IV. The phase V (360-0 cal yr B.P.) corresponds to lake level lowering, soil formation and eutrophication. The Timbi lake sediments demonstrate the potential for lakes in semi-arid alluvial plains of western India to preserve proxy flood records providing additional archives for generating long-term datasets. The flood record generated substantiates palaeoflood data from the fluvial archive suggestive of regional-scale southwest monsoon variability. Low frequency-high magnitude floods occurred during arid periods and low magnitude-high frequency events during relatively strengthened monsoon and thus have implication for linking the palaeoflood events to the southwest monsoon intensity in the semi-arid continental regions.					; TIWARI, POOJA/KHV-4732-2024	TIWARI, POOJA/0000-0001-9666-7181; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 15	2020	542								109581	10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109581													WOS:000517852600005

GEOLOGICAL FACTORS AND PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF GROUNDWATER FORMATION IN THE TUNKA DEPRESSION	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												The article describes the complex hydrogeological conditions of the Baikal rift zone viewed as a large structural element and pioneers in distinguishing two independent hydraulic systems in the study area. Groundwater resources and compositions of groundwater in these two systems are generated in fundamentally different ways. In the deep sediment layers, groundwater generated due to sedimentation is at the stage of elision (exfiltration) water exchange. Active phase transition of clay minerals to hydromica causes an additional water release, and sedimentary water and regenerated groundwater infiltrate from the condensed clay strata to sandy horizons. This process is accompanied by decompaction, heaving sand, and high (extra-high) reservoir pressures. Nitrogen-rich water and carbonic thermal water associated with faults and fault nodes are widespread in the basement of the Tunka depression. The thermal water result from infiltration and, together with fresh water, represents a uniform hydraulic system. Its development is determined by the dynamics of infiltration water in the water-feeding area in the Tunka loaches. At different hypsometric levels of the hydrogeological section, nitrogen-rich water descends, while carbonic thermal water ascends, and these processes occur simultaneously. Our study is focused on the physicochemical processes of the interaction between groundwater and sedimentary and crystalline rocks. It shows that the ion-salt and gas compositions of not only nitrogen-rich thermal water, but also those of methane water and carbonic thermal water occur in the 'water-rock' system without involving any additional substance from external sources. Compared to other thermal water, the composition of carbonic water is formed in a more complex way: first, it goes through the stage of the nitrogen-rich thermal water while passing through the aluminosilicate rocks and only then interacts with the carbonate rocks and become carbonic. The formation of carbonic water is accompanied by intensive karst processes at depths, which are ceasing closer to the surface. As a result of degassing, an opposite process is activated: authigenic minerals and travertines are formed on the surface. Groundwater and its gas phase are involved in the formation of rocks with a negative temperature, which are abundant in the Tunka depression, as well as large positive forms of the relief. It is shown that the activity of groundwater is not limited to the role of a filler in the host rocks and an intermediary medium between different geospheres. Groundwater is an active agent that initiates, controls and implements many geological processes.

Aghgol, situated in the Mil plain of the Kur-Araz lowlands has a semi-desert landscape and is an important overwintering and nesting place for birds. In the dry areas of the National Park, grass-swamp, gray-grass, saline and silicified grass-swamp, saline and silicified gray-grass soils are widespread. Its largest part is the Lake Aghgol, an internationally recognized area of global importance which was declared as Important Bird Area (IBA) when it was placed in the list of Ramsar wetlands of international importance in 2001. The Aghgol national park was founded on the basis of Aghgol natural reserve, Aghgol state preserve and adjoining territories under a decree of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic dated July 5, 2003. The main purpose of the creation of Aghgol National Park is to protect important wetlands, the semi-desert landscape characteristic of that area, endangered species of fauna living in and around the lake, to reintroduce some species of fauna characteristic of the area to their former territories, as well as to monitor the environment, to ensure the ecological education of the population and the development of ecotourism. The lake is mostly surrounded by reeds. The park is designed to protect the marshy ecological system, as the nesting and wintering places of migratory and water birds.

J	Munroe, JS				Munroe, Jeffrey S.			Ground Penetrating Radar Investigation of Late Pleistocene Shorelines of Pluvial Lake Clover, Elko County, Nevada, USA	QUATERNARY												Beach ridges constructed by pluvial Lake Clover in Elko County, Nevada during the Late Pleistocene were investigated with ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The primary objective was to document the internal architecture of these shorelines and to evaluate whether they were constructed during lake rise or fall. GPR data were collected with a ground-coupled 400-Mhz antenna and SIR-3000 controller. To constrain the morphology of the ridges, detailed topographic surveys were collected with a Topcon GTS-235W total station referenced to a second class 0 vertical survey point. GPR transects crossed the beach ridge built by Lake Clover at its highstand of 1725 m, along with seven other ridges down to the lowest beach at 1712 m. An average dielectric permittivity of 5.0, typical for dry sand and gravel, was calculated from GPR surveys in the vicinity of hand-excavations that encountered prominent stratigraphic discontinuities at known depths. Assuming this value, consistent radar signals were returned to a depth of similar to 3 m. Beach ridges are resolvable as similar to 90 to 150-cm thick stratified packages of gravelly sand overlying a prominent lakeward-dipping reflector, interpreted as the pre-lake land surface. Many ridges contain a package of sediment resembling a buried berm at their core, typically offset in a landward direction from the geomorphic crest of the beach ridge. Sequences of lakeward-dipping reflectors are resolvable beneath the beach face of all ridges. No evidence was observed to indicate that beach ridges were submerged by higher water levels after their formation. Instead, the GPR data are consistent with a model of sequential ridge formation during a monotonic lake regression.																			2571-550X					MAR	2020	3	1							9	10.3390/quat3010009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat3010009													WOS:000523723300003

The ban an ineffective but tardy solution to the country's fast depleting forest halted local charcoal production and shifted the business to neighboring countries. This paper outlines the charcoal market, it's distribution channels and alternative cooking fuels used in Kisumu, Kenya as explored by the GreenBriq team. GreenBriq is a social venture that plans to undertake two consequential problems in Western Kenya; the lack of a cheap sustainable cooking fuel and the overpopulation of water hyacinth on shorelines of Lake Victoria. GreenBriq resolves both problems by coupling them and creating water hyacinth briquettes which are designed to be used as a cheap cooking fuel. The team travelled to Kenya in May 2018 to test hypotheses made while outlining their business model and to conduct surveys that would aid the understanding of the charcoal market within Kisumu, Kenya. The team discovered the three players that facilitate distribution: the suppliers who import and/or export from Uganda, the brokers they sell to in Kisumu and the market retailers that sell to the consumer. The transportation of charcoal has become difficult due to the ban and costly in terms of unofficial tariffs demanded by custom officers and other regulators. The losses fall primarily on retailers and ultimately the end users. Other alternative fuels produced from charcoal dust and made into briquettes have failed to take large shares of the market due lack of consistency in supply, inability to meet demand, and lack of brand popularity in the market which can be accredited to their chosen channels of distribution. The goal is for GreenBriq to use the current distribution chain to sell and distribute water hyacinth briquettes in order to market the fuel appropriately and gain acceptance.																			2377-6919		978-1-7281-1780-5				2019							546	551		10.1109/ghtc46095.2019.9033024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ghtc46095.2019.9033024													WOS:000568648200098
J	Mora, G; Zanazzi, A				Mora, German; Zanazzi, Alessandro			Hydrogen isotope ratios of moss cellulose and source water in wetlands of Lake Superior, United States reveal their potential for quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The hydrogen isotopic composition of organic substrates provides valuable information on past hydrological changes. To explore whether quantitative information can be obtained from this proxy, we measured D/H ratios of cellulose extracted from mosses inhabiting both hollow and hummock sites in three swales located near Lake Superior, United States. These isotope ratios were compared to those of potential water sources, namely swale, moss, and ground water, to evaluate whether cellulose D/H ratios reflect those of its water sources. For that evaluation, we relied on a better mechanistic understanding of the isotopic fractionation occurring during cellulose synthesis in plants as well as the relative simplicity of moss physiology in regard to water use strategies and a dataset that combines published D/H ratios for modern moss cellulose. We found that moss cellulose delta D values for hollow species (-118.1 +/- 8.5 parts per thousand) were significantly depleted (p = 0.016) in D by 8 parts per thousand in relation to those for hummock species (-110.1 +/- 8.1 parts per thousand), possibly due to an averaging effect taking place in hollow species. In addition, we found that 40% of the hydrogen in cellulose from hollow species probably experienced isotopic exchange with the surrounding cell water, and this percentage is not statistically different from that (42%) obtained from an analysis of published data on modern moss cellulose. This analysis also reveals that the fraction of hydrogen in modern moss cellulose that is subjected to isotope exchange falls within a relatively narrow range (+/- 3%). Using this range and a mechanistic model, we were able to estimate source water SD values using those measured for moss cellulose, and these estimates were statistically indistinguishable from the measured SD values of moss and swale water. Further, the ratios of delta D/delta O-18 of moss cellulose of hollow species yielded values that are similar to those reported for the local meteoric water line, thus adding a potential source of paleo-hydrological reconstructions from moss cellulose. Consequently, our combined results suggest not only that moss cellulose D/H ratios reflect those of source water, but that the latter values can be estimated fairly precisely from cellulose D/H ratios using a relatively simple mechanistic model. However, the accuracy of this model hinges on assumptions that need to be tested further to corroborate its widespread applicability.																			0009-2541	1878-5999				SEP 30	2017	468						75	83		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.08.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.08.017													WOS:000409517800007
J	Lang, JC; Gao, H; Lin, Y; Gu, HT				Lang, Jichao; Gao, Hao; Lin, Yang; Gu, Haitao			Online estimation of vertical velocity for deep-sea carriers based on depth data	OCEAN ENGINEERING												Seabed residential stations are essential for the future exploration of the deep-sea exploration. Deep-sea carriers accompany transport equipment for underwater resident stations. To accommodate the low-energy consumption and low-cost nature of deep-sea carriers, an online vertical velocity estimation method based on depth data is proposed. This method serves as a cost-effective alternative to the expensive acoustic and inertial velocity measurement equipment conventionally used in underwater navigation systems. To meet the demand for lowcost online velocity measurements, a dynamic model was created for buoyancy-driven vehicles such as deepsea carriers during unpowered ascent. Two distinct methods were used to process depth sensor data: one involves central differencing followed by low-pass filtering, and the other entails the differentiation of the data after fitting it to dynamic equations. This approach yields two different types of estimated velocities. A sliding window was defined and used the variance of the velocity and fitting coefficient within the window as indicators to assess the uncertainty of the velocity data. Based on this evaluation, an adaptive weight allocation rule for the fusion process was formulated. This approach allows us to derive the weighted estimated velocity. Through lake trials, the weighted estimated velocity was validated to closely match the ideal velocity data and showed a substantial reduction in velocity variance compared to the differenced estimated velocity that was not fused. This indicates that the fluctuations in the velocity data were significantly reduced. In addition, the integrated displacement showed an average absolute error of 0.1769 m compared with the measured displacement. This indicates that the weighted estimated velocity effectively reflects the true state of motion of the deep-sea carrier. Furthermore, when unexpected motion occurs in deep-sea carriers, the weighted estimated velocity can prevent falling into the "smoothness trap." This demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm.																			0029-8018	1873-5258				SEP 15	2024	308								118197	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.118197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2024.118197		MAY 2024											WOS:001249017800001
J	Khachan, MM; Bhatia, SK				Khachan, M. M.; Bhatia, S. K.			Influence of fibers on the shear strength and dewatering performance of geotextile tubes	GEOSYNTHETICS INTERNATIONAL												Geotextile tubes have been widely used for the dewatering of high water content fine sediments. Fine sediments include lake sediments, organic soils and coal combustion products, which generally have low shear strength. Several researchers have emphasized the effect of the retained sediment (filter cake) properties on dewatering performance and stability of the geotextile tubes. Maintaining retained sediment properties, in particular permeability and shear strength, allows for faster dewatering time, better retention of sediments and improved stability of the geotextile tubes during multiple filling stages and during the tube stacking process. Several studies have shown that the use of synthetic fibers can increase the shear strength of sand, silt and clays. However, the use of fibers to improve the strength of retained sediments in geotextile tubes has not been explored. In this study, three synthetic fibers varying in length and diameter were used to evaluate the effect of fibers on the dewatering performance and shear strength of the fine sediments. A cationic polyacrylamide flocculant was used as an optimum conditioner for the selected sediment. The fibers were mixed with the flocculant conditioned slurry at 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2% fiber concentration by mass of the dry solids. The effect of fibers on the undrained shear strength of the dewatered sediments was evaluated using a lab vane test, fall cone test and undrained unconsolidated triaxial test. Jar tests and pressure filtration tests were also conducted to evaluate the effect of fiber on the required flocculant dosage and on the dewatering performance. Based on the results of this study, 0.5% of F1 fiber type was found to be the optimum fiber concentration, yielding an approximately 100% increase in undrained shear strength. It was also found that the diameter and length of the fibers play a significant role in altering the undrained shear strength of the tested sediments. The relatively short (6 mm) and thick (38 mu m) fiber did not yield an increase in shear strength for all the tested fiber concentrations, whereas thin fibers (9 mu m) of similar length increased the shear strength by 100%. Furthermore, it was found that the use of fibers at any concentration decreases the required optimum doses of flocculant by about 15%, and increases the dewatering rate of the effluents by about 50%.																			1072-6349	1751-7613				OCT	2016	23	5					317	330		10.1680/jgein.15.00053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jgein.15.00053													WOS:000385390900001

It is found that 11 yr and 21 yr solar periodicities affected the White Nile originating from the Equatorial plateau. On the other hand the Blue Nile arising mainly from Lake Tana in Ethiopia was affected mostly by the 3.3 yr, 2.9 yr, 2.7 yr, and the 2.52 yr periodicities. Such short periodicities are also present in cosmic rays. This is fairly true as during weak solar cycles series at the bottom of the 80120 year Solar Wolf-Gleissberg Cycles, the level of the second to last of the weak cycles rise and fall coherently with full solar cycles with a correlation coefficient of about 0.9. Rain over Ethiopia is affected by the Monsoon precipitation which is related to the quasi biennial oscillations QBO of the equatorial zonal wind between the easterlies and the westerlies in the tropical stratosphere with a mean period of 29 months. We propose that the QBO are stimulated by the 2.52-2.48 yr solar periodicities. The 2.52 and 2.48 yr periodicity is strong in odd solar cycles 21 and 23. Generally speaking, it looks that different solar periodicities are space-time dependant and that they affect different regimes of terrestrial responses. In the case of earthquakes, we think that they are related to geomagnetic storms initiated by solar stimuli. Several solar periodicities are found in earthquakes. We postulate that electric currents in the ring current and in the ionosphere induce surface as well as deep electric currents in the magma thus produce motion and disturbances of the plates and the magma leading to earthquakes and volcanoes.

Mauna Loa geochemistry from 1843 to the 2022 eruption	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												In late 2022, Mauna Loa erupted for similar to 13 days from Moku'aweoweo summit and the Northeast Rift Zone, the first eruption in nearly 38 years following decades of unrest. This study presents high-precision trace element concentrations and Pb-Hf-Nd-Sr isotopic compositions of 15 lavas that span the entire duration and spatial extent of the eruption. Subtle but consistent variations in the major, minor, and trace element concentrations and isotopic compositions of lavas with time that correlate with variations in seismicity suggest that magmatic processes such as shallow assimilation, magma mixing, and/or transport path control both seismicity and lava chemistry. These trends are used to identify the dominant process during each phase of the eruption whether shallow (assimilation of previous intrusions or solidified lavas with the establishment of the eruption) or deeper (pulses in magma transport from the shallow magma reservoir during the last 3 days of the eruption). The temperature of Mauna Loa lavas has fallen approximately 56 degrees C over the last 179 years, a time during which trace elements, MgO-normalized major elements, and isotopic compositions have co-varied. These geochemical trends suggest that the depths and degree of melting, as well as the amount of clinopyroxene and composition of a lithologically heterogeneous mantle source have changed with time. The increase in Sr-87/Sr-86 and Pb-208*/Pb-206* with decreasing Nd-143/Nd-144 (i.e., increasingly isotopically enriched compositions) over the last similar to 60 years is likely related to the low magma flux during this time, which, taken along with increases in depth of melting and decrease in temperature, suggests that Mauna Loa may be entering its transition to the postshield volcanic stage.																			0258-8900	1432-0819				AUG 23	2025	87	9							76	10.1007/s00445-025-01854-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-025-01854-9													WOS:001558587500001

The pegmatite extends over 140 m with a width of 1.3 m and unknown depth within Neoproterozoic gneiss. The pegmatite contains plagioclase, quartz, and lepidolite with minor K-feldspar, spodumene, muscovite, and topaz, and accessory amounts of cassiterite, amblygonite, columbite-tantalite, monazite, zircon, apatite, and fluorite. Locally, minor secondary quartz and lepidolite occur interstitially between plagioclase and quartz and along the edges of primary lepidolite, respectively, implying late-stage hydrothermal influence. Lithogeochemical data show that the pegmatite contains 0.3-1.12 wt% Li, 256-1285 ppm Cs, and 59-522 ppm Ta. Monazite U-Th-Pb geochronology yielded an age of 144.9 +/- 2.8 Ma while cassiterite yielded a U-Pb age of 134.8 +/- 1.4 Ma. Lepidolite yielded 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 131.25 +/- 0.3 Ma. These age results fall during the geodynamic evolution of an intracontinental extension accompanied by the exhumation of metamorphic core complexes and extensive magmatism in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. These events occurred due to a combination of gravitational collapse resulting from lithospheric delamination and asthenospheric upwelling. The geodynamic setting during the pegmatite emplacement implies abnormally hot conditions, ruling out the possibility of anatectic origin. The pegmatite dike with elevated concentrations of Be, Ga, Rb, Nb, Sn, Cs, Ta, and Tl supports a granitic origin with a hidden parental granite at depth. The fact that the Idermeg terrane contains several LCT pegmatites implies an important exploration target for Li exploration.

The results show that fine-grained gravity flow is one of the important sedimentary processes in deep lake environment, and it can transport fi-ne-grained clasts and organic matter in shallow water to deep lake, forming sweet sections and high-quality source rocks of shale oil. Fine-grained gravity flow deposits in deep waters of lacustrine basins in China are mainly fine-grained high-density flow, fine-grained turbidity flow (including surge-like turbidity flow and fine-grained hyperpycnal flow), fine-grained viscous flow (including fine-grained debris flow and mud flow), and fine-grained transitional flow deposits. The distribution of fine-grained gravity flow deposits in the warm and humid unbalanced lacustrine basins are controlled by lake-level fluctuation, flooding events, and lakebed paleogeomorphology. During the lake-level rise, fine-grained hyperpycnal flow caused by flooding formed fine-grained channel-levee-lobe system in the flat area of the deep lake. During the lake-level fall, the sublacustrine fan system represented by unconfined channel was developed in the flexural slope breaks and sedimentary slopes of depressed la-custrine basins, and in the steep slopes of faulted lacustrine basins; the sublacustrine fan system with confined or unconfined channel was developed on the gentle slopes and in axial direction of faulted lacustrine basins, with fine-grained gravity flow deposits possibly existing in the lower fan. Within the fourth-order sequences, transgression might lead to organic-rich shale and fine-grained hyperpycnal flow deposits, while regression might cause fine-grained high-density flow, surge-like turbidity flow, fine-grained debris flow, mud flow, and fine-grained transitional flow deposits. Since the Permian, in the shale strata of lacustrine basins in China, multiple transgression-regression cycles of fourth-order sequences have formed multiple source-reservoir assemblages. Diverse fine-grained gravity flow sedimentation processes have created sweet sections of thin siltstone consisting of fine-grained high-density flow, fine-grained hyperpycnal flow and surge-like turbidity flow deposits, sweet sections with interbeds of mudstone and siltstone formed by fine-grained transitional flows, and sweet sections of shale containing silty and muddy clasts and with horizontal bedding formed by fine-grained debris flow and mud flow. The model of fine-grained gravity flow sedimentation in lacustrine basin is significant for the scientific evaluation of sweet shale oil reservoir and organic-rich source rock.

Its absence in southern coasts today is attributed to ocean water cooling as a result of Middle-Late Holocene changes in relative influence of the warm waters of the Brazil Current and the cold waters of the Malvinas/Falklands Current, but geomorphologic and stratigraphic data suggest that coastal evolution controlled mainly by glacioeustatic-driven oscillations may have also played a role on the shifts of its distribution. Here we review the past and present distribution of A. flexuosa along southern Brazil, establishing a correlation with the Holocene geological history of this area. The Holocene post glacial marine transgression (PMT) produced a large complex of interconnected coastal lagoons landward of sandy barriers stretching from southern Brazil (state of Rio Grande do Sul) to Argentina, creating a corridor that allowed for the southward dispersion of A. flexuosa. The few available numerical ages indicate that A. flexuosa was established in the northern coastal plain of Rio Grande do Sul around similar to 7.1 ka BP, and by similar to 5.8 ka BP it had reached the southern plain, facilitated by warmer ocean waters than today and the sea-level highstand of 6-5 ka BP. The combination of cooling, sea-level fall that reduced marine influence, and fluvial inputs of freshwater and sediments, converted most of the lagoon complex into smaller isolated freshwater lakes after similar to 4 ka BP, leading to the regional extinction of that species. The fossils of A. flexuosa and other tropical mollusks in middle and late Pleistocene interglacial barrier-lagoon coastal deposits along the southwestern Atlantic suggest that their latitudinal distribution shifted cyclically, driven by glacial-interglacial oscillations of sea-level and temperatures. The understanding of the coastal processes that affected the distribution of A. flexuosa may help assessing how mollusks and other marine species respond to environmental forcings related to sea-level oscillations and climate, thus contributing from a paleobiological perspective for conservation and management efforts under present and future scenarios of changes in coastal ecosystems.

J	TREASURER, JW				TREASURER, JW			THE ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE OF PIKE, ESOX-LUCIUS L, IN 2 SCOTTISH LAKES	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Histological changes in the ovaries of pike from two shallow, adjacent, Scottish lakes are described and related to a macroscopic scale of maturity stages and to changes in gonad weight. There was no evidence of pre-ovulatory degeneration although occasional residual oocytes were present in spent ovaries. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was high in males from October to March, and in females it increased through the winter months to a maximum immediately prior to spawning. Maximum ovarian weight was 8.3-9.0% of total body weight compared with only 0.9-1.1% for testes. These GSIs were low compared with other reports for the British Isles, suggesting lower reproductive output. Spawning occurred in the first two weeks of April at a water temperature of 6.0-7.5.degree. C. Fecundity was described from a regression of egg number (F) on fork length (F.L.): log10 F = -1.51 + 3.33 log10 F.L. (cm). Mean egg diameter after preservation varied from 1.1 to 2.4 mm over the size range examined. Males were mature at age 2 at a length of .gtoreq. 27 cm, while females first spawned at age 3 at a length of .gtoreq. 28 cm, although a minority were mature at age 2. The sex ratio was 1.2 males : 1 female at Kinord and 1.4 : 1 at Davan. Greater egg production at Davan, 50 678 ha-1, compared with Kinord, 33 557 ha -1, was due to higher individual fecundity-at-age resulting from better growth. Fecundity (19.29 .times. 103 calculated for a pike of 55 cm F.L.), relative fecundity of only 10-24 eggs per gram wet weight of adult, and GSI values were low compared with pike in North America and Eurasia. Food supply may restrict reproductive output of pike in Lochs Kinord and Davan. The abundance ratio of predator : prey is high with the main prey species, perch, present in low numbers, and the only alternative species is eel in these simple fish communities.

J	Tackman, GE; Currey, DR; Bills, BG; James, TS				Tackman, GE; Currey, DR; Bills, BG; James, TS			Paleoshoreline evidence for postglacial tilting in Southern Manitoba	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					Special Session on Physical Environment and History of the Lake Winnipeg Basin at the Geological-Association-of-Canada Meeting	MAY 27-29, 1996	WINNIPEG, CANADA	Geol Assoc Canada				Detailed air photo interpretation and four seasons of field mapping and surveying in southern Manitoba have revealed that the once-level paleoshorelines of Lake Winnipegosis and Dauphin Lake and the Burnside shoreline of former Lake Agassiz have been tilted up to the northeast by postglacial differential rebound. Our investigation has also revealed that Lake Winnipegosis has the best preserved paleoshoreline record of any of the large lakes in southern Manitoba, including lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba. This is because northeasterly uptilting shifts the region's lakes to the southwest. Lakes with southern outlets, like Lake Winnipegosis, undergo general regression as the outlet is lowered relative to the rest of the basin. Lakes with northern outlets, like lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba, undergo general transgression as northeasterly uptilting raises the outlet relative to the rest of the basin. Along the northeastern shore of Lake Winnipegosis a staircase of at least 32 abandoned Winnipegosis shorelines exists that is consistent with northeasterly tilting. The Dawson level represents the major mid-Holocene highstand on Lake Winnipegosis. It persisted for about 500 years, peaking at 5290 C-14 yr B.P. (early Dawson) and then falling about 3 m by 4740 C-14 yr B.P. (late Dawson). The early Dawson shoreline is tilted at 13.5 cm km(-1) in a direction N24.3 degrees E. Three other shorelines informally named shoreline 4, shoreline 3, and shoreline 2 are also tilted up to the northeast. Their radiocarbon ages (and slopes in cm km(-1)) are 3330 yr B.P. (2.2), 1510 yr B.P. (1.3), and 1080 yr B.P. (0.7), respectively. On Dauphin Lake shoreline IV is the oldest level mapped for this study. It has a C-14 age of 7910 yr B.P. and is tilted at 21.7 cm km(-1) in a direction N44.4 degrees E. The Id shoreline marks the major mid-Holocene highstand for Dauphin Lake. It peaked at 4640 C-14 yr B.P. followed by a rapid decline of about 1 m to the Ib shoreline, which is dated at 4320 C-14 yr B.P. Id is tilted up at 8.8 cm km(-1) in a direction N53.4 degrees E. The next major shoreline is Ia3 which has a C-14 age of 3020 yr B.P. and is tilted up at 5.3 cm km(-1) in a direction N62.3 degrees E. Tilt directions are significantly more easterly for the Dauphin Lake shorelines than those from Lake Winnipegosis or any of the much older Lake Agassiz shorelines. Taken together, the Winnipegosis and Dauphin isobases indicate that the direction of tilt in southern Manitoba is more complex than a simple uni-directional pattern. The observed pattern of tilting for paleoshorelines in southern Manitoba agrees better with predictions derived from the recently revised loading history model ICE-4G than with those from its predecessor ICE-3G. In general, the calculated tilt based on the ICE-3G load tends to exceed the observed tilt, while ICE-4G tends to underestimate it. Both ice load models appear to disagree most with our observed tilts in this region during the interval before about 9000 cal yr B.P., when deglaciation was proceeding rapidly and the large water load associated with Lake Agassiz covered the region. Because both of these ice load models have been estimated mainly from a global data set of relative sea level curves from marine coast sites, it is not unexpected that model tilts derived from them do not agree well with observations in the North American continental interior. The pattern of postglacial crustal deformation for southern Manitoba described in this paper could be used to further refine ice load models for the North American continental interior.

To improve water quality in hypereutrophic Hodges Reservoir, California, United States, a hypolimnetic oxygenation system (HOS), using pure oxygen gas, was implemented in 2020. This study encompasses 3 years of pre-oxygenation data (2017-2019) and 2 years of post-oxygenation data (2020-2021) to understand the cycling of nutrients, metals, and mercury in the reservoir. During the wet year of 2017, mildly reduced conditions lasted until mid-summer in the enlarged reservoir. Nutrients and metals were seen in the hypolimnion including ammonia (similar to 2 mg-N/L), manganese (similar to 0.5 mg/L), phosphate (similar to 0.5 mg-P/L), and sulfide (similar to 10 mg/L). Production of methylmercury (MeHg), an important bioaccumulative toxin, was favored from April to June with a hypolimnetic accumulation rate of around 200 ng/m(2)<middle dot>d. In contrast, the dry year of 2018 exhibited higher hypolimnetic concentrations of ammonia (similar to 4 mg-N/L), manganese (similar to 1 mg/L), phosphate (>0.5 mg-P/L), and sulfide (>15 mg/L). The rapid onset of highly reduced conditions in 2018 corresponded with low MeHg hypolimnetic accumulation (similar to 50 ng/m(2)<middle dot>d). It seems that mildly reduced conditions were associated with higher MeHg accumulation, while sulfidic, reduced conditions impaired inorganic mercury bioavailability for MeHg production and/or promoted microbial demethylation. Sulfide also appeared to act as a sink for iron via FeS precipitation, and potentially for manganese via MnS precipitation or manganese coprecipitation with FeS. Mass flux estimates for 2017-2019 indicate that much of the nutrients that accumulated in the hypolimnion moved via turbulent diffusion into the epilimnion at loading rates far exceeding thresholds predicting eutrophic conditions. After oxygenation in 2020-2021, the reservoir water column was highly oxidized but showed a lack of thermal stratification, suggesting reservoir operations in combination with HOS implementation inadvertently mixed the water column in this relatively shallow reservoir. Post-oxygenation, concentrations of ammonia, phosphate, manganese, and mercury in bottom waters all decreased, likely in response to oxidized conditions. Oxygenated bottom waters exhibited elevated nitrate, a byproduct of ammonia nitrification, and iron, a byproduct of FeS oxidation, indicating a lake-wide response to oxygenation.

Cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of boulders on last-glacial and late-glacial moraines, Lago Buenos Aires, Argentina: Interpretive strategies and paleoclimate implications	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												in situ cosmogenic nuclides have become a powerful means to determine surface exposure ages of boulders on moraines and other landforms that are important to paleoclimate reconstructions. Potentially the largest and least quantifiable source of uncertainty of these surface exposure ages is the variable exposure histories of individual boulders. We use the mean square of weighted deviates (MSWD) statistic and cumulative frequency plots to identify groups of boulders that have statistically similar ages based on the number of analyses and their uncertainties. These samples most likely represent the true age of the moraine. We use these tools to interpret 49 Be-10 and Al-26 surface exposure ages of erratic boulders on six last-glacial and late-glacial moraines at Lago Buenos Aires, Argentina (LBA; 71 degrees W, 46.5 degrees S). Seven of the 49 boulders are identified as anomalously young, and are interpreted to have been exhumed after moraine deposition. The remaining 42 samples indicate that glacial advances or still-stands of the ice margin occurred at 22.7 +/- 0.9, 21.4 +/- 1.9, 19.9 +/- 1.1, 17.0 +/- 0.8, 15.8 +/- 0.6, and 14.4 +/- 0.9ka (weighted mean ages 2(+/- 2 sigma, analytical, erosion rate, and attenuation length uncertainties). This chronology of an outlet of the Patagonian Ice Cap is comparable to many records in the Northern Hemisphere despite a maximum in local summer insolation during this period. The implication is that climate during the Last Glacial Maximum was generally synchronous at the global scale. However, the late-glacial readvance to 95% of the extent of the largest advance during the Last Glacial Maximum at 14.4 +/- 0.9 ka is distinctively "Antarctic" in nature. It is contemporaneous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal, and precedes the Younger Dryas Chronozone. Further, our precise exposure ages highlight climatic asynchrony across southern South America between 23 and 14 ka. The timing of maximum ice extent and onset of deglaciation at LBA occurred similar to 4 ka later than in the northern parts of the Chilean Lake District (41 degrees S), but were synchronous with glacial advances or still stands in the Strait of Magellan (52 degrees S). This regional asynchrony is likely related to the strength and position of the Southern Westerlies. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Occupancy and detectability of Snowy Plovers in western Utah: an application to a low density population	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Occupancy modeling can be used to identify habitat characteristics associated with species occurrence. Additionally, occupancy sampling can provide measures of detection probability, increasing confidence in monitoring efforts. Little is known about the distribution and habitat preferences of a small population of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius nivosus) in western Utah. We conducted a study to estimate occupancy and detection probability of Snowy Plovers in western Utah during 2011 and 2012. We made repeated visits to randomly selected survey plots during the breeding period, sampling 84 64-ha plots in 2011 and 100 64-ha plots in 2012 and recording the number of adults and habitat characteristics in each plot. We then modeled the relationship between detection, occupancy, and covariates that included distance to water, distance to roads, land cover types, and characteristics of the vegetation. We also included covariates for observer, Julian date, temperature, cloud cover, and wind speed when modeling detection probability. Detection probability was high (0.74, 95% CI = 0.57-0.86) and positively influenced by temperature. Occupancy of 64-ha plots was low (0.27, 95% CI = 0.18-0.39) and did not vary by year. Occupancy of Snowy Plovers was negatively associated with distance to water ( = -0.62 0.31, 95% CI = -1.23 to -0.01) and percent shrub cover ( = -0.28 0.02, 95% CI = -0.58 to -0.01). Land cover types also influenced plot occupancy. Management actions that conserve shallow water and adjacent habitats or minimize disturbance in these areas are likely to have conservation benefits for Snowy Plovers where water is scarce. Because our detection probabilities were high, investigators involved in future monitoring efforts can achieve reasonable precision with limited revisits to sample plots.

En los anos 2011 y 2012, hemos muestreado 84 parcelas de 64-ha y 100 parcelas de 64-ha, respectivamente. En cada parcela de muestreo, registramos el numero de adultos y las caracteristicas del habitat. Luego modelamos la relacion entre la deteccion, la presencia, y las covariables que incluyeron la distancia al agua, distancia a las carreteras, tipos de cobertura vegetal y las caracteristicas vegetativas. Cuando modelamos la probabilidad de deteccion, tambien se incluyeron covariables para el observador, el dia juliano, la temperatura, la nubosidad, y la velocidad del viento. Probabilidad de deteccion fue alta (0.74, 95% CI = 0.57-0.86) e influenciada positivamente por la temperatura. Presencia en terrenos de 64-ha fue baja (0.27, IC 95% = 0.18-0.39) y no vario de un ano a otro. Presencia del Chorlitejo Blanco se asocio negativamente con la distancia al agua ( = -0.62 +/- 0.31, IC 95% = -1.23 a -0.01) y con el porcentaje de arbusto ( = -0.28 +/- 0.02, IC 95% = -0.58 a -0.01). Los tipos de cobertura vegetal tambien influyeron la presencia del chortilejo blanco en las parcelas. En areas donde el agua es escasa, medidas administrativas que conservan aguas poco profundas y habitats adyacentes, o que reduzcan al minimo las perturbaciones en estas areas, son probable que pueden apoyar a la conservacion del Chorlitejo Blanco. El modelo de presencia proporciono un metodo para estudios de esta poblacion del Chorlitejo Blanco, y ademas podria ser utilizado en otras areas. Debido a que nuestras probabilidades de deteccion eran altas, las encuestas futuras puedan obtener una precision de presencia razonable con visitas limitadas a las parcelas de muestreo.

In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene to investigate the impact of the thermal pollution on the bacterioplankton communities in a subtropical bay (the Daya Bay). We observed that thermal pollution from the cooling system of the nuclear power plant caused a pronounced thermal gradient ranging from 19.6 degrees C to 24.12 degrees C over the whole Daya Bay. A temperature difference of 4.5 degrees C between the northern and southern parts of the bay led to a regime shift in the bacterioplankton community structure. In the three typical scenarios of regime shifts, the steady-state transition of bacterioplankton community structure in response to temperature increasing was more likely consistent with an abrupt regime shift rather than a smooth regime or a discontinuous regime model. Water temperature was a decisive factor on the regime shift of bacterioplankton community structure. High temperature significantly decreased bacterioplankton diversity and shifted its community compositions. Cyanobium and Synechococcus of Cyanobacteria, NS5 marine group of Bacteroidota, and Vibrio of Gammaproteobacteria were found that favored high temperature environments. Furthermore, the increased water temperature significantly altered the community assembly of bacterioplankton in Daya Bay, with a substantial decrease in the proportion of drift and others, and a marked increase in the proportion of homogeneous selection. In summary, we proposed that seawater temperature increasing induced by the thermal pollution resulted in an abrupt regime shift of bacterioplankton community in winter subtropical bay. Our research might broad our understanding of marine microbial ecology under future conditions of global warming.

J	CORDONE, AJ; FRANTZ, TC				CORDONE, AJ; FRANTZ, TC			AN EVALUATION OF TROUT PLANTING IN LAKE TAHOE	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Experimental plants of various strains of rainbow and cutthroat trout (Salmo gairdnerii and S. clarkii) made in Lake Tahoe from 1960 to 1963 were evaluated for both immediate and long-range contributions to the sport fishery. None of the plants was considered as successful as was desired. Lahontan and Yellowstone cutthroat (S. c. henshawi and S. g. lewisi) contributed least to the fishery. Estimated total harvests of various Kamloops rainbow (S. g. kamloops) plants were never greater than 4%. However, they showed some potential for providing a long-range or premium fishery. Domestic rainbow contributed relatively few premium fish to the creel, but had the highest immediate returns (3 to 36%). The majority of those caught were recaptured within 60 days of release. An occasional Kamloops and domestic rainbow survived in the lake for as long as 3 to 4 years. To demonstrate other characteristics (e. g., movements, growth, etc.) of trout stocked in Lake Tahoe, returns from plants made over a 9-year period (1956-1964) were used. Kamloops and Williams Lake rainbow (a wild strain from Idaho) distributed themselves widely in Tahoe''s limnetic zone, and the Kamloops commonly entered its tributaries. Domestic and Pyramid Lake rainbow (a wild strain from Nevada) tended to remain in the lake in shallow, rocky areas. Initially, planted trout grew at a rate of about 0. 4 in. per month and then gradually tapered off to about 0. 1 in. per month after 30 months in the lake. The largest premium trout came from plants of domestic rainbow trout. Lack of an adequate food supply, mortality associated with life in the tributaries, and predation of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) appear to be the factors most responsible for the poor survival of stocked trout. Put-and-take plants of large (10- to 14-in.) domestic rainbow made from the shore during summer months appear to offer the best means of improving fishing through stocking, particularly for anglers fishing from the shore or from piers.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1968	54	2					68	+																WOS:A1968B044900001

A 250 ka sedimentary record from a small karstic lake in the Northern Levant (Yammouneh, Lebanon) Paleoclimatic implications	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Levant, influenced by both the Mediterranean Sea and the Saharan-Arabian deserts, is a key region for understanding climatic changes in response to glacial/interglacial boundary conditions that have greatly affected regional hydrology. Here, we present the first long-term paleoenvironmental record from the northern Levant, presently much wetter than the southern Levant. Our record derives from the multi-proxy study of a sediment core (36 m long) retrieved from the small intra-mountainous, tectonic basin of Yammouneh (Lebanon), which is mainly supplied by karstic springs. Sediments consist of a thick accumulation of brownish to greenish clayey silts, interrupted by intervals of whitish marls composed of CaCO3 rich material. The core chronology is based on radiometric dating (C-14 and U/Th) and paleomagnetic techniques. The sedimentary sequence spans approximately the last two glacial-interglacial cycles (similar to 250 ka). Carbonate content is relatively high throughout the profile due to a perennial input of detrital calcite from the watershed, but varies significantly. The marls are mostly composed of authigenic and biogenic calcite and reflect lacustrine environments with high carbonate productivity during peaks of interglacial periods. Their occurrence suggests low physical erosion of the basin slopes which were covered by arboreal vegetation, and intense karstic water circulation under warm and relatively wet conditions, in agreement with pollen data. The clayey silts are dominated by quartz and clay minerals, and a few amounts of K-feldspars and dolomite. They are characterized by high concentration in magnetic particles, and high relative concentrations of Si, Al, K and Fe considered as strictly of detrital origin. Due to the carbonated nature of the watershed, quartz and K-feldspars are attributed to eolian origin from a distal source. The clayey silt intervals generally suggest palustrine conditions with abrupt flows responsible for runoff-derived material, or subaerial environments and low local water availability in particular during the Last Glacial Maximum. High Si/Al and K/Al ratios, during interglacials, are attributed to relatively high eolian dust contribution due to the decrease of local detrital inputs. Our study reveals significant differences between Yammouneh and lake records from the Dead-Sea basin (southern Levant), the latter showing high/low levels during glacial/interglacial periods. These hydrological differences might reflect either changes in the North-South (NS) rainfall gradient in response to the development of the northern ice sheet and the southward migration of the westerly belt, or local factors, i.e., a decrease in efficient precipitation and water availability at Yammouneh during the coldest glacial periods (e.g., the Last Glacial Maximum), due to water storage by ice caps on the Mount Lebanon range and frozen soils in the Yammouneh basin.

M.; Perez-Sanchez, Julio; De Girolamo, Anna Maria; Gentile, Francesco			Assessment of pollutants from the Canale d'Aiedda basin to the sea: SWAT model and Remote Sensing Approach	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Water quality impairment is a concern in water resources management. During floods, a large amount of sediment and pollutants may be delivered to the river reaching the coastal zone and forming plumes that impact coastal water bodies. The present paper aims to assess spatial patterns of pollutants from the catchment to the sea, identifying the sources of nutrients within a basin, and their fate in the sea. An ecohydrological model, Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and remote sensing techniques (Sentinel-2 imagery, processed on Google Earth Engine), using the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), were coupled and tested in the Canale d'Aiedda basin and Mar Piccolo Sea (Apulia, Southern Italy). The SWAT model was calibrated using daily flow and discrete sediment and nutrient concentrations. The highest specific load of total nitrogen (TN) (similar to 10 kg ha(-1)y(-1)) was simulated in the agricultural subbasins (vineyards, olive groves, and winter wheat). Similarly, the highest specific load of total phosphorus (TP) (0.7 kg ha(-1)y(-1)) was predicted in the subbasins where the vineyard was the prevalent crop production. NDTI was analyzed for detecting sediment concentrations in river plumes during a flash flood event (0.066 m(3)s(-1), June 10, 2023). The post-event NDTI showed increased turbidity along the coast. The results indicate that flash floods play an important role in sediment and pollutant loads delivered to the sea. This study also shows that Sentinel-2 satellite data and cloud computing enhanced turbidity monitoring into the sea or lake, complementing the SWAT results. The methodology applied in the study showed that hydrological models and remote sensing should be coupled for basins and coastal areas ecosystems protection.

Initial Thermal Performance of Diavik's A21 Dike	COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING 2019					18th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering and the 8th Canadian Permafrost Conference (ICCRE/CPC)	AUG 18-22, 2019	Quebec, CANADA	Canadian Geotechn Soc Eastern Quebec & Natl, Canadian Permafrost Assoc, Int Permafrost Assoc, Canadian Natl Comm, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Cold Reg Engn Div				Following four years of construction, a new open-pit to access a diamondiferous kimberlite pipe (A21 Pipe), was officially opened at the Diavik Diamond Mine on August 20, 2018. The site is located approximately 300 km northeast of Yellowknife, NT, in a zone of continuous permafrost. The A21 Pipe is in a depression just offshore of South Island in Lac de Gras that had developed a through talik. A 2,200 m long ring dike was constructed to allow dewatering of the depression and to mine the kimberlite pipe by open-pit mining. Near the lake shore, the rockfill dike is founded on permafrost, whereas in deeper waters, the foundation is on unfrozen lakebed sediments and till over bedrock. A cut-off wall was installed to reduce seepage through the dike and its unfrozen foundation. Within the section of the dike founded on permafrost, the frozen soil and bedrock are used as a hydraulic barrier. It was therefore essential to understand the extent of the permafrost into Lac de Gras, especially on the South Abutment, where the water is shallow, and the lakebed topography forms a complex-shaped submerged peninsula with talik under the permafrost. Boreholes and geophysical surveys were used to estimate the extent of the talik and provide input for the design. During the initial phase of construction, extensive ground temperature monitoring and detailed observations were used to verify the extent of permafrost assumed in the design. These measures helped with the understanding of the complex ground thermal regime and provided information on the thermal behaviour of the foundation required to guide some of the construction decisions, such as the required initiation of active freezing by the use of thermosyphons or the timing of the placement of additional dike embankment construction material to accurately lock in winter frost and protect the permafrost from thawing.

CONSUMPTION OF MINE WATER BY WILD UNGULATES IN THE SOURCES OF THE USSURI RIVER, ON THE TERRITORY OF THE NATIONAL PARK ⟪CALL OF THE TIGERS	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the study is determined by the need to clarify the reason for the use of mineralized water by wild animals, which is typical for many areas of the world. The new knowledge is closely related to the geophagy problem, the solution of which opens a wide prospect of fundamental research in the fields of landscape biogeochemistry, ecology and medicine.Purpose: to study chemical composition of the mineralized mine water in the lake located on the territory of the out-of-operation tinpolymetallic ores concentrator dump in the upper Ussuri river which is being consumed actively by wild ungulates; to reveal number of animal visitors to the lake during an annual cycle; to reveal the reason of mine water consumption.Objects: ungulates visiting the lake with mine water; lake water and bottom sediments.Methods: estimation of visitation of the mine lake by animals by means of photographic traps; chemical composition determination: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent 7700x spectrometer, Agilent Techn., USA); atomic emission spectrometry (spectrometer iCAP 7600 Duo); ion chromatography (LC-20 ion-liquid chromatograph, Shimadzu, Japan).Results. It was revealed that animals come to the lake uniformly throughout the year, except for the winter period, when the water is covered by a thick layer of ice. In high concentrations trace elements were found, including both elements with high toxicity (Cd and Pb) exceeding MAC for drinking water from 20 to 80 times and essential elements such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Cr, Ni, Se, Li, which concentration either does not exceed MPC or exceeds it insignificantly. The concentration of REE, especialy of the light subgroup, is also very high. The reason for mine water consumption by animals, most likely, is the high concentration of rare-earth elements of the light subgroup in it.

A first research drilling through this "inner crystalline ring" of the Ries was performed at the Erbisberg hill (SW Ries) to better understand the internal structure and lithology of this feature, and possibly reveal impact-induced hydrothermal alteration. The drill core intersected the slope of a 22 m thick postimpact travertine mound, before entering 42 m of blocks and breccias of crystalline rocks excavated from the Variscan basement at >500 m depth. Weakly shocked gneiss blocks that show that shock pressure did not exceed 5 GPa occur above polymict lithic breccias of shock stage Ia (10-20 GPa), with planar fractures and planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz. Only a narrow zone at 49.20-50.00 m core depth exhibits strong mosaicism in feldspar and {101 over bar 2} PDFs in quartz, which are indicative of shock stage Ib (20-35 GPa). Finally, 2 m of brecciated Keuper sediments at the base of the section point to an inverse layering of strata. While reverse grading of clast sizes in lithic breccias and gneiss blocks is consistent with lateral transport, the absence of diaplectic glass and melt products argues against dynamic overthrusting of material from a collapsing central peak, as seen in the much larger Chicxulub structure. Indeed, weakly shocked gneiss blocks are rather of local provenance (i.e., the transient crater wall), whereas moderately shocked polymict lithic breccias with geochemical composition and Sr-87/Sr-86 signature similar to Ries suevite were derived from a position closer to the impact center. Thus, the inner ring of the Ries is formed by moderately shocked polymict lithic breccias likely injected into the transient crater wall during the excavation stage and weakly shocked gneiss blocks of the collapsing transient crater wall that were emplaced during the modification stage. While the presence of an overturned flap is not evident from the Erbisberg drilling, a survey of all drillings at or near the inner ring point to inverted strata throughout its outer limb. Whether the central ring of the Ries represents remains of a collapsed central peak remains to be shown. Postimpact hydrothermal alteration along the Erbisberg section comprises chloritization, sulfide veinlets, and strong carbonatization. In addition, a narrow zone in the lower parts of the polymict lithic breccia sequence shows a positive Eu anomaly in its carbonate phase. The surface expression of this hydrothermal activity, i.e., the travertine mound, comprises subaerial as well as subaquatic growth phases. Intercalated lake sediments equivalent to the early parts of the evolution of the central crater basin succession confirm a persistent impact-generated hydrothermal activity, although for less time than previously suggested.

C-band RISAT-1 imagery for geospatial mapping of Cryospheric surface features in the Antarctic environment	EARTH OBSERVING MISSIONS AND SENSORS: DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION IV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Earth Observing Missions and Sensors - Development, Implementation, and Characterization IV	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			Cryospheric surface feature classification is one of the widely used applications in the field of polar remote sensing. Precise surface feature maps derived from remotely sensed imageries are the major requirement for many geoscientific applications in polar regions. The present study explores the capabilities of C-band dual polarimetric (HH & HV) SAR imagery from Indian Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1) for land cryospheric surface feature mapping. The study areas selected for the present task were Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. RISAT-1 Fine Resolution STRIPMAP (FRS-1) mode data with 3-m spatial resolution was used in the present research attempt. In order to provide additional context to the amount of information in dual polarized RISAT-1 SAR data, a band HH+HV was introduced to make use of the original two polarizations. In addition to the data calibration, transformed divergence (TD) procedure was performed for class separability analysis to evaluate the quality of the statistics before image classification. For most of the class pairs the TD values were comparable, which indicated that the classes have good separability. Fuzzy and Artificial Neural Network classifiers were implemented and accuracy was checked. Nonparametric classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) was also used to classify RISAT-1 data with an optimized polarization combination into three land-cover classes consisting of sea ice/snow/ice, rocks/landmass, and lakes/waterbodies. This study demonstrates that C-band FRS1 image mode data from the RISAT-1 mission can be exploited to identify, map and monitor land cover features in the polar regions, even during dark winter period. For better landcover classification and analysis, hybrid polarimetric data (cFRS-1 mode) from RISAT-1, which incorporates phase information, unlike the dual-pol linear (HH, HV) can be used for obtaining better polarization signatures.					; Jawak, Shridhar/G-9678-2012	Luis, Dr Alvarinho J./0000-0002-3425-8048; Jawak, Shridhar/0000-0002-0648-3109													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0122-2				2016	9881								98811R	10.1117/12.2222782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2222782													WOS:000385792900039
J	HERCZEG, AL; CHAPMAN, A				HERCZEG, AL; CHAPMAN, A			URANIUM-SERIES DATING OF LAKE AND DUNE DEPOSITS IN SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA - A RECONNAISSANCE	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					CONF ON SALT LAKES, EVAPORITES AND AEOLIAN DEPOSITS	AUG 08-16, 1988	ARKAROOLA, AUSTRALIA	SALT LAKES EVAPORITES & AEOLIAN DEPOSITS PROGRAM				Changes in the hydrologic cycle throughout the late Quaternary in Australia are evident from raised lake shorelines in the interior salt-lake basins, evaporites recovered from cores within these lakes, and carbonate pedogenesis within aeolian dune sequences. Most of these features are fraught with poor absolute chronologic control especially beyond the range of radiocarbon dating (> 35,000 yr B.P.). Uranium-series methods can potentially extend the chronology to about 350,000 yr B.P. provided that the minerals remain closed to uranium and thorium exchange after deposition and that corrections to detrital contamination can be adequately made. Samples of carbonates, gypsum and halite were collected from a variety of sites within the semi-arid and arid regions of southeastern Australia in an attempt to assess the feasibility of the U-series dating technique. The U-series method shows some promise for placing constraints on the timing of palaeoclimatic changes in Australia. Contamination with non-radiogenic Th-230 can be overcome in most instances using an isochron correction scheme for a sequential acid-leach procedure. Uranium-series methods can provide the most reliable dates from samples in the arid regions of the continent where post-depositional exchange with groundwater U can be assumed to be minimal. Where "reliable" C-14 dates have already been obtained, the U-series dates are in general accord except at Lake Mungo, N.S.W., where U-series dates are considerably younger. Two major high lake-stands were identified at Lake Frome, South Australia at approximately 21,500 and 140,000 yr B.P. Dune stabilisation (i.e. humid conditions) inferred from dates of pedogenic CaCO3 occurred within the Strzelecki dunefield of northern South Australia at around 22,000, 68,000 and 145,000 yr B.P. These dates fall between most TL dates for dune-building episodes within the Strzelecki desert and therefore are consistent with palaeoclimatic reconstructions for the arid core of Australia. U-series dates on upper salt horizons of Lake Eyre and Lake Frome suggest that at least two periods of hyper-aridity occurred within the Holocene (< 10,000 yr B.P.).

J	Deswal, S; Dogra, SK				Deswal, Surinder; Dogra, Sachin Kumar			Water Quality Assessment of Brahma Sarovar: A Sacred Lake at Kurukshetra (India)	ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS												Brahama Sarovar, in Kurukshetra city (India), is an ancient sacred lake where devotees perform various religious activities/offerings on daily basis, and on special occasions of solar and lunar eclipses, millions of pilgrims all over the country have mass bathing (holy-dip) for internal and external purity. Along with religious importance, this artificial lake also acts as a sacred grove/wetland that serves as an important wintering and stopover site for migratory birds from the Palearctic region. The study was carried out with the objective to analyze the improvement in water quality status after the provision of a closed conduit for the supply of fresh water to the lake and additional measures required for public health safety. For this, the water quality of this sacred lake has been spatially analyzed and compared with Indian standards prescribed for 'Designated Best Use Class-B: Outdoor Bathing (Organised)' in the present study. Though the parameters - pH (7.94 within the limits of 6.5-8.5), turbidity (3.63 < 5 NTU), TDS (222.33 < 500 mg/L), TSS (100.25 mg/L) and MPN (239.25 < 500 per 100 ml) were observed to be within the permissible limits, but DO (4.7 < 5.0 mg/L) and BOD (3.54 >= 3.0 mg/L) of the lake water were found beyond the permissible limits. Thus, making the lake water unfit for human use for bathing. The comparison with the previous two studies revealed that the lake's water quality has improved in the last couple of years through the provision of a closed conduit, in place of an open channel, for the supply of fresh canal water to the lake. A couple of additional measures have also been suggested to maintain the water quality standards in the lake so as to protect the human health of the devotees and pilgrims.

J	He, WY; Zhi, YJ; Shao, MQ				He Wenyun; Zhi Yijin; Shao Mingqin			Sex Ratio, Habitat Selection and Foraging Behavior of Mandarin Duck in Water Systems of Poyang Lake, China	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												From February to March 2017, November 2017 to March 2018 and November 2018 to March 2019 we used the point count method to survey the sex ratio, habitat selection and foraging behavior of Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) in water systems (Raohe River, Ganjiang River and Xiuhe River) of Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China. We recorded 162 individuals and determined 141 by gender: the sex ratio was 1.07. There was no significant male bias (n = 141, p = 0.210). Habitat selection results indicated that Mandarin duck tended to choose habitat with vegetation cover (2.40 +/- 0.84) on riverbanks, with shoal proportions of 8.00 +/- 6.00%, water velocity of 0.16 +/- 0.12m/s and wider river widths of 190.90 +/- 113.80 m. The foraging habitats were far from sources of disturbance such as mine factory (2.70 +/- 0.48), village (286.10 +/- 168.97 m) and road (114.50 +/- 105.01 m). Our study showed that riverbank vegetation (Z=2.614, P=0.009), distance to village (Z=-2.859, P=0.004) and road (Z=-2.085, P=0.037) in the foraging habitats were significantly higher than in control plots, indicating that Mandarin duck clearly preferred habitats with higher vegetation cover remote from both village and road. Principal component analysis indicated that water flow speed, distance to village, river width, vegetation cover, distance to mine factory and shoal proportion were the main factors for habitat selection. The results suggested that safety was the primary factor in habitat selection. The main foraging method was up-ending (61.54%); the duration of each up-ending foraging behavior was 1.92 +/- 0.83 s and foraging frequency was 14.67 +/- 4.43 times/min. This foraging strategy may be determined by food distribution and morphological structure.																			0030-9923					DEC	2020	52	6					2251	2256		10.17582/journal.pjz/20191113041120	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/20191113041120													WOS:000591649900026

Winning the shell game: environmental DNA (eDNA) confirms local control of the invasive apple snail, Pomacea maculata	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												In 2019, the South American apple snail Pomacea maculata established a reproductive population in a six-acre retention pond, Bear Lake, in south Austin, Texas, USA. Community-led removal efforts provide a case study to examine how environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring may play a role in management of biological invasions. Since 2020, concerned neighbors have removed 4,942 snails by hand and destroyed 1,734 egg clutches. In October 2021, we began collecting surface water samples for eDNA analysis with quantitative PCR as visual surveys still occasionally found snails. Without intervention, the high reproductive capacity of P. maculata could cause the population to rebound. However, multiple factors, including homeowner hand removal and cold winter freezes, have kept population numbers low. A few monthly nearshore eDNA samples indicated the ongoing presence of apple snails, and we hypothesized that deeper areas of Bear Lake might provide refuge. To test our hypothesis, we used a Van Dorn sampler to collect water at five mid-lake locations from surface, 1 m, 2 m, and (variable) bottom depths. We detected no eDNA to indicate snail presence in deeper water. Particularly in the colder months (November-January), detection of small amounts of apple snail eDNA in surface water samples occurred without coincident collection of snails or egg clutches, suggesting either a residual source of eDNA or a few individuals remaining. Throughout 2023, we continued to encounter fewer than 5 snails per month, which did not correspond to the monthly eDNA sampling results, indicating standing eDNA concentrations below the limit of detection or a need for more frequent sampling. Overall, due to intense efforts, especially in 2020 (with an estimated 99% of snails removed), visual and eDNA monitoring efforts suggest that the snail population may be close to local extirpation. We recommend cautious optimism but continued vigilance to assure that the population does not recover.

Relief Structure and Postglacial Evolution of Natural and Climatic Conditions of the Central Part of the Oka Plateau (Eastern Sayan)	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This article presents the results of a comprehensive geomorphological and paleogeographic study of the central part of the Oka Plateau (Eastern Sayan). The relief structure of the region is characterized in detail. A special place in it is occupied by elements of the paleohydronetwork: basins of drained moraine-dammed water bodies and abandoned fragments of valleys, including marginal channel. A comprehensive record has been obtained from the bottom sediments of Lake Sagan-Nur, which makes it possible to reconstruct a consistent picture of changes in the natural environment in the lake basin in the Holocene. It is shown that, about 8600-7100 BP, the lake was fed by glaciers, large flood events occurred in its basin, the water level in the lake was higher than today, and it was probably connected to a moraine-dammed paleowater body (traces of which are recorded in the estuary part of the Aynak River valley). Later, about 7100-5500 BP, a sharp drop in the rate of lacustrine sedimentation and a gradual attenuation of the relative amplitude of flood events occurred. After 5500 BP, the warming of the regional climate, especially in winter, and the disappearance of the "remnants" of the late Pleistocene glaciers caused a gradual expansion of dry areas at lower hypsometric levels favorable for the regional development of pine forests and the rise of the upper boundary of pine on the slopes. At the end of this time interval, the last restructuring of the local hydrographic network occurred and the modern river system was finally formed. Reconstructions for the last 5500 years show a much calmer hydrological regime and sedimentation pattern. Palynological indices also suggest a warming of the regional climate and a decrease in soil moisture, which took place following a change in the influx of solar radiation in the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated northern hardwood forests in the Upper Great Lakes region may be particularly sensitive to chronic NO3- deposition, because relatively moderate experimental increases (three times ambient) have resulted in substantial N leaching over a relatively short duration (5-7 years). Although microbial immobilization is an initial sink (i.e., within 1-2 days) for anthropogenic NO3- in this ecosystem, we have an incomplete understanding of the processes controlling the longer-term (i.e., after 1 year) retention and flow of anthropogenic N. Our objectives were to determine: (i) whether chronic NO3- additions have altered the N content of major ecosystem pools, and (ii) the longer-term fate of (NO3-)-N-15 in plots receiving chronic NO3- addition. We addressed these objectives using a field experiment in which three northern hardwood plots receive ambient atmospheric N deposition (ca. 0.9 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and three plots which receive ambient plus experimental N deposition (3.0 g NO3--N m(-2) year(-1)). Chronic NO3- deposition significantly increased the N concentration and content (g N/m(2)) of canopy leaves, which contained 72% more N than the control treatment. However, chronic NO3- deposition did not significantly alter the biomass, N concentration or N content of any other ecosystem pool. The largest portion of 15 N recovered after 1 year occurred in overstory leaves and branches (10%). In contrast, we recovered virtually none of the isotope in soil organic matter (SOM), indicating that SOM was not a sink for anthropogenic NO3- over a 1 year duration. Our results indicate that anthropogenic NO3- initially assimilated by the microbial community is released into soil solution where it is subsequently taken up by overstory trees and allocated to the canopy. Anthropogenic N appears to be incorporated into SOM only after it is returned to the forest floor and soil via leaf litter fall. Short- and long-term isotope tracing studies provided very different results and illustrate the need to understand the physiological processes controlling the flow of anthropogenic N in terrestrial ecosystems and the specific time steps over which they operate.

Evaluating Regeneration in Heterobasidion Root Disease Infested Stands in the Lake States	FOREST SCIENCE												Heterobasidion root disease (HRD) infection is becoming increasingly common in red pine plantations of the Lake States. Although stump treatment can reduce rates of overland transmission, infested stands continue to experience expansion of mortality pockets. Natural regeneration into HRD mortality pockets can assist with revegetation. The objective of this study was to determine what tree species naturally regenerate in red pine plantations impacted by HRD in Wisconsin and Michigan. We visited 49 pockets (in 31 stands) in Wisconsin and Michigan that had existing confirmed HRD infections during the fall of 2017. We surveyed the regeneration in the pocket and measured the species and basal area of overstory trees 10 m from the expanding edge of the pocket. Overall, pockets were regenerating with desirable species, some of which are susceptible to HRD. Additionally, woody invasive species were present in 39 percent of the pockets. We expect these pockets to generally fill with desirable species of regeneration, although long-term successful regeneration by susceptible species such as pines may be limited. Study Implications: Heterobasidion root disease is an important cause of mortality in conifer plantations in the Lake States. Just for red pine, the states of Michigan and Wisconsin have a combined total of over half a million hectares of plantation. Because of the regional importance of red pine plantations, efforts to control forest health issues are both ecologically and economically important. Management should focus on reducing pathogen introduction, because, once a site is infested, both aboveground and belowground transmission is possible. Once the pathogen is introduced to a stand, pockets continue to expand through time and serve as a reservoir of inoculum for aboveground transmission. After infestation, the combination of both above and belowground transmission can severely reduce viable conifer growing stock within a stand. Landowners often choose either to clearcut stands with significant infestation or to presalvage future mortality by cutting a buffer zone of live trees around existing pockets. Although pockets generally have adequate regeneration of desirable species, conversion from heterobasidion-root-disease-susceptible conifers to resistant hardwoods may occur over time, potentially impacting the economic value of stands.

An experiment was carried out in the watershed of Lake Koronia in northern Greece in 1991/1992 to study the effect of wheat cultivation practices on the quality of surface runoff water and transported soil sediments. The treatments were a combination of ploughing and no ploughing, of straw burning and no straw burning. and of N application at four rates (0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha(-1), with the highest rate supplied as split application). The surface runoff water and the transported soil sediments in it were collected from the lower parts of the field edge for analysis. The NO2- and NH4+ in the runoff water were not affected by the rate of applied fertiliser. The NH4+ concentration was independent of the way the fertiliser was applied, while NO3- increased when the fertiliser was applied pre-planting and NO2- decreased. The NO3- concentrations in the runoff water decreased during the plant-growing period, while the concentrations of the major cations K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and the anion Cl- decreased significantly. Sediments also decreased significantly during the growing period in both ploughing and burning treatments. The concentrations of total N (Kjeldahl), P, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the sediments were not affected by the ploughing, straw burning and application of fertilisers. In most of the treatments, the grain yield was higher in ploughed plots than in the unploughed ones and higher in burnt than in unburnt plots. The highest grain yield was observed when 50 kgN ha(-1) were applied. A small reduction of grain yield was found for application of 100 and 150 kg N ha(-1). When 150 kg N ha(-1) were applied in split application (pre-plant and spring). the grain yield was almost the same as with the application of 50 kg N ha(-1). The results indicate that some eutrophication of field margins from runoff occurs and that there are opportunities to reduce field application rates of N fertiliser. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

On the energy transfer of tsunamis generated by subaerial granular landslides: A 2D numerical analysis	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Tsunamis generated by landslides represent a significant hazard in coastal, fjord and lake environments. Their accurate modeling, using both physical and mathematical models, is crucial for activities such as risk assessment and mitigation strategies. Both approaches can provide valuable insights on the physics of landslide-tsunamis; however, due to the very complex nature of the problem, more efforts are needed to further understand the basic process of tsunami generation and propagation. In this sense, the study of the problem from an energetic perspective can provide valuable information, especially focusing on the energy transfer mechanisms between landslides and water waves. This paper presents a two-dimensional (2D) numerical study aimed at the energy mapping of tsunamis generated by subaerial granular landslides. To this end, several parametric simulations are carried out with OpenFOAM (R), systematically varying some selected governing parameters (landslide falling height, water depth, and slope angle). For each simulation, several dimensionless energy quantities were computed and analyzed to investigate the energy transfer mechanisms between the landslide and the water waves. Further, the ability of some parameters to describe the efficiency of the energy transfer process for tsunami generation and propagation is investigated. At least for the cases considered in this study, it appears that the shape of the landslide vertical front at the impact and the extent of the submerged path are more important than the landslide velocity at the impact in terms of tsunamis generation efficiency. Finally, synthetic energy quantities have been examined from a broader perspective to derive overall insights into the energy transfer process between subaerial granular landslides and tsunamis, leading to the formulation of a first basic version of a nondimensional energy wavemaker curve.

Power outputs associated with these events approach 600 MW and are superimposed on a baseline energy flux of approximately 200 MW. The baseline heat flux suggests a magma solidification rate of 0.012 km3/yr and background volatile release rates of 1000 t/d H2O, 66 t/d, S, 13 t/d Cl, and 0.5 t/d F. These fluxes are comparable to fluxes of F, Cl and S exiting the magmatic/hydrothermal system through acidic flank springs and are about a factor of five less than estimated volatile fluxes through summit fumaroles during the high-temperature event of 1981-1983. Mass balance considerations suggest that heat released at the lake surface is primarily supplied by the ascent of heated brines supplemented by condensation of fumarolic steam. Calculated average seepage rates out of the lake (almost-equal-to 450 kg/s) indicate rapid convection of acidic lake brine through underlying lake sediments and pyroclastic deposits. Circulation of the extremely corrosive lake brine through the volcanoclastic material beneath the lake may enhance subsurface permeabilities. Fluxes of rock-forming elements observed in the Rio Agrio basin on the northwest flank of Poas suggest that dissolution and removal of volcano-clastic material occurs at a rate of approximately 1650 m3/yr. However, estimated sulfur fluxes from the cooling magma body suggest that porosity created by this dissolution could quickly be filled by the deposition of native sulfur. Finally, analysis of heat and water budgets for the crater lake over the period 1978-1989 indicates that the recent decline and disapperance of the lake was caused by variations in summit rainfall combined with an increase in subsurface heat flow to the lake in 1987-1988. The increase in heat flow is related to continued degassing of high-temperature volatiles following a hydrofracturing/magma ascent episode that occurred in 1986.

This exceptional sensitivity to climate change, and the availability of long sedimentary archives, make the Dead Sea a benchmark for long quantitative paleohydrological reconstructions. However, discontinuities and chronological uncertainties in the marginal sedimentary record have hampered the reconstruction of Dead Sea lake levels beyond the Last Glacial (70-14 ka before present, BP). Here, we apply a two-pronged methodology. First, we measure the lake water density along ICDP deep core 5017-1-A using a new method, Brillouin spectroscopy on two-phase halite fluid inclusions; we combine it with the composition of pore water and the thickness of halite layers in the core to reconstruct lake level, volume, mass balance and subsidence rate. Second, we tune the chronology of lake levels from outcrops by matching it to the chronology of the deep core. The resulting lake level reconstruction, spanning 237-70 ka BP, is validated by the excellent agreement between outcrop-and mass balance-based methodologies. It shows a long-term recession of the lake, its level decreasing from one interglacial to the other, down to a Holocene record low. There are two reasons for this lake level fall. First, with an average rate of 2.65 +/- 0.15 m/ka, subsidence has outpaced sedimentation at least over the last-130 ka. Second, by reducing the solute inventory of the lake, massive halite pre-cipitation events such as that of 131-116 ka BP have durably increased surface water activity and evaporation, and thus lowered the lake level, up to today. Conversely, our analysis suggests that, during 191-11 ka BP, the dissolution of Mount Sedom salt diapir and freshwater inflows provided to the lake about three times the mass of solute NaCl contained in the modern Dead Sea (in 1985). This massive solute influx, occurring mainly during glacial highstands, strongly contributed to lowering surface water activity and evaporation and, therefore, to increasing the lake volume. Our results suggest that Dead Sea lake levels are more accurately interpreted in terms of climatic change if surface water activity is taken into account.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterization of Western Painted Turtle Bycatch in Fyke Nets During Freshwater Fish Population Assessments	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												In fisheries management, fish populations are assessed using various net types that invariably also capture nontarget species. Although the bycatch of turtles tends to be a common occurrence, data describing the bycatch of turtles during freshwater fish sampling are lacking. To improve the available knowledge base concerning the bycatch of turtles during fish sampling, we characterize the dynamics of western painted turtle Chrysemys picta bellii bycatch in unbaited modified fyke nets used in fish population sampling in northeastern South Dakota. We collected data from June to September during fish population assessments in 39 lakes and nine impoundments between 2007 and 2012. We characterize western painted turtle bycatch relating to water type (lake and impoundment) including catch rates (number of turtles/net night), size structure, and sex ratio. Catch rates were higher in impoundments than lakes. Total mean annual catch rates ranged from 1.07 to 3.28 for lakes and from 0.70 to 6.63 for impoundments and the variation among years was significant for both water types. We observed no annual variation in water surface area or mean depth, precluding either from explaining the variation in annual catch rates. We observed a significant relationship between mean depth and catch rate for lakes, but not impoundments. We observed no significant relationship relating surface area to catch rate for lakes or impoundments. Catch rates differed significantly from June to September for lakes but not impoundments. Annual variation in catch rates was best explained by the previous winter precipitation for both water types. The sex ratio was skewed toward males and differed significantly from June to September for lakes but not impoundments. The size structure was skewed toward large turtles. Understanding bycatch dynamics during fish population assessments is a critical first step to understanding the impact of biological sampling on nontarget species and may prove useful in minimizing future bycatch of western painted turtles.																			1944-687X					JUN	2016	7	1					222	230		10.3996/102014-JFWM-077	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/102014-JFWM-077													WOS:000378082600023

The delta(13) C and delta(15)N of a taphonomic series of Rhizophora mangle L. (Red mangrove) leaves were analyzed from Twin Cays, Belize, to facilitate reconstruction of past mangrove ecosystems. On Twin Cays, fresh leaves of dwarf R. mangle trees (similar to0.5 m high) were found to have more negative delta(15) N values (mean = -10%.) and more positive delta(13)C values (mean = -25.3parts per thousand) compared to tall R. mangle trees (mean delta(15)N = 0parts per thousand, delta(13)C= -28.3parts per thousand). These isotopic differences can be related to nitrogen and phosphorus availability [Ecology 83 (2002) 1065]. We investigated three taphonomic stages in the fossilization of R. mangle leaves into peat with the following: (1) senescent leaves; (2) fallen leaves on the surface of the peat; and (3) sub-fossil leaves found within mangrove peat. In addition, by examining natural leaf assemblages we established that VC and delta(15)N of R. mangle leaves were not altered during senescence, despite a significant (50%) decrease in the N%. Modern dwarf and tall trees could still be identified from delta(13) C and delta(15)N analyses of the leaf assemblages found directly below a tree. Dwarf and tall trees could also be identified from VC analyses of leaves that had decomposed for four months. Although dwarf and tall trees could not be statistically separated after four months according to delta(15)N analyses, leaves with very negative delta(15)N (-7parts per thousand) were only collected below dwarf trees. Leaf fragments were present in similar to50 cm long cores of peat from four sites on the island, and their isotopic compositions were determined. The ranges of delta(13)C (-29 to -22parts per thousand) and delta(15)N (-11 to +2parts per thousand) values from sub-fossil leaves were similar to the ranges from modern leaves (delta(13)C = -29 to -23parts per thousand, delta(15)N = -11 to +1parts per thousand). The sub-fossil leaf isotopic compositions were independent values, in comparison to the uniform values of the surrounding peat. Because of the stability and persistence of the stable isotopic signals, they could contribute significantly to a multi-proxy approach to mangrove palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

Cuona Lake, located on the central TP, is a transitional zone of atmospheric circulation that is well situated for investigations on the interplay between the ISM and mid-latitude westerlies. In this study, multiple proxies of lacustrine sediments from Cuona Lake were measured, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13(org), n-alkanes, and their hydrogen isotopes, to reconstruct the evolution of climate on the central TP over the past 13 cal kyr BP. Decreased TOC/TN ratios, dominant short-chain n-alkanes/alkanoic acid C-15/16/17, and lower values of n-alkane indicator ratios (carbon preference index and average chain length) throughout the investigated period suggest that the organic matter of the lake essentially originated from aquatic algae, and was weakly affected by terrestrial input. The historic variations in the delta D, TOC, and delta C-13(org) values revealed cold-wet conditions during 12.4-11.4 cal kyr BP, warm-wettest environments during the early Holocene (from 11.4 to 8.2 cal kyr BP), cool-wet conditions in the mid-late Holocene (from 5 to 3 cal kyr BP), and warm-dry conditions since 3 cal kyr BP. The reconstructed climatic variability in the Cuona area agrees well with previous indexes in south-central TP, indicating that the climatic pattern of the studied area is basically controlled by the monsoonal circulation from the late part of the last deglaciation to the early Holocene, with the ISM reaching the north-central TP at similar to 11 cal kyr BP. During the mid-late Holocene, the humid conditions coincided with an enhanced influence of westerlies, providing strong evidence for the contribution of westerlies-delivered moisture to the central TP. Based on a comparison of paleoclimate records, the Cuona region displays a transitional phase between monsoon circulation and westerly jets during the Holocene.

MODERN POLLEN RECORD ON BAT GUANO DEPOSIT FROM SIJU CAVE AND ITS IMPLICATION TO PALAEOECOLOGICAL STUDY IN SOUTH GARO HILLS OF MEGHALAYA, INDIA	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												Meghalaya is well known for its rich tropical biodiversity and numerous natural caves. The Siju Cave of Meghalaya, also known as cave of the bat, is among the longest caves on the Indian subcontinent. The palynological study of fifty bat-guano samples from Siju Cave and of thirty surface soil and moss cushion from the area immediate surrounding the cave reflects the close similarity between the modern pollen and vegetation in the region in the two areas sampled. The resulting palynodata comprise mainly the native flora, dominated by riparian taxa like Duabanga, Syzygium, Careya, and Ficus, along with evergreen and deciduous elements in the region. The evergreen taxa Mesua, Elaeocarpus, and Garcinia, along with Impatiens, reflect the high precipitation in the region. The climate of the region and the vegetation are strongly influenced by the Simsang River, and the heavy rainfall results in the dominance of riparian taxa and other high-rainfall indicator taxa. The occurrence of pollen from Nepenthes khasiana, an endemic and endangered plant of Meghalaya, in bat guano is significant and may be due to its insectivorous and entomophilous nature. However, medicinal plants like Swertia chirata, Cinchona, and Rauvolfia are not encountered in the bat-guano sediments, despite their luxuriant growth around the cave, and these species could be avoided by the insects due to their alkaloid contain and bitter taste. The presence of highland taxa such as Pinus, Abies, Picea, and Larix in the bat guano deposit is significant and suggestive of high winds from higher altitudes, or the pollen may be introduced by the return of migratory Siberian birds during winter to the nearby Siju wildlife and bird sanctuary. The recovery of cerealia along with Areca catechu and Citrus pollen indicate the human activity in the region. The abundance of fungal remains, namely Meliola, Glomus, and Microthyriaceae along with degraded palynomorphs are suggestive of strong microbial activity under warm and humid conditions during sedimentation in the region. The main objective of this study is to identify the potential of bat guano for palaeoecological research and as supportive data for surface and sedimentary soil profiles in the South Garo Hills of Meghalaya. The palynodata from the bat guano of the Siju Cave provides a useful source for palaeoecological information for the South Garo Hills, where intensive natural and human-caused forest fires, heavy rainfall, and soil erosion occur every year and there is a relative scarcity of the lake, wetland, and swamp habitats that normally preserve pollen.																			1090-6924	2331-3714				DEC	2014	76	3					173	183		10.4311/2013PA0119	http://dx.doi.org/10.4311/2013PA0119													WOS:000348409500003

This study examines the concentrations of zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in sediments, seawater, and marine organisms (Ulva lactuca and Epinephelus marginatus) along the coastlines of Susah and Tobruk, Libya. The sampling involved 66 samples from 10 sites conducted in winter 2023. The contamination of cadmium clearly showed in all studied samples in Susah and Tobruk, whereas lead surpassed permissible in seawaters and livers, gills, and tissues of E. marginatus. The iron was high in the seawaters of Susah and Tobruk, particularly near Susah port and in Tobruk Gulf, reflecting the influence of industrial and anthropogenic activities. The results revealed that cadmium levels in the sediments indicated considerable contamination in Susah (CF = 5.897) and moderate contamination in Tobruk (CF = 1.12). The assessment employed several pollution indices, including the Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), which indicated that all studied metals were uncontaminated in Tobruk, while Cd showed moderate contamination in Susah (Igeo = 1.975). The Nemerow Pollution Index (NI) categorized Susah as seriously polluted (NI = 6.01) and Tobruk as lightly polluted (NI = 1.195). Additionally, bioaccumulation factors for heavy metals in both U. lactuca and E. marginatus indicated acute contamination, particularly lead in fish tissues. These findings underscore the urgent need for effective environmental management strategies to address heavy metal pollution and protect the health of marine ecosystems and local communities reliant on these coastal resources.Practitioner Points Comprehensive pollution profiling (CF, Igeo, NI, and EF) in the study areas.

Yet, it comes as an astonishment that a few reported near-surface items and water vapor fluxes as so far required for water resources decision support, particularly in a scarce observation data region. As a contributive effort, here we adjusted the sensible heat flux (H) calibration mechanism of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to high-resolution satellite dataset coupled with in-situ observation, through a wise guided "anchor" pixel assortment from surface reflectance-alpha, Leaf area index-LAI, vegetation index-NDVI, and surface temperature (P-cold, P-hot) to model the robustness of energy fluxes and Evapotranspiration-ETa over the basin. Results reasonably reflected ETa which returned low RMSE (0.6 mm d(-1)), MAE (0.48 mm d(-1)) compared to in-situ recordings, indicating the competence of SEBAL to predict vapor fluxes in this region. The adjustment unveiled the estimates of the land-use contribution to evapotranspiration with an average ranging from 3 to 4.69 mm d(-1), reaching a maximum of 5.5 mm d(-1). Furthermore, findings showed a high striking energy dissipation (LE/Rn) across grasslands and wetlands. The vegetated surfaces with a great evaporative fraction were associated with the highest LE/Rn (70-90%), and water bodies varying between 20% and 60%, while the desert ecosystem dissipated the least energy with a low evaporative fraction. Still, besides high portrayed evaporation in water, grasslands and wetlands varied interchangeably in accounting for the highest ETa followed by cropland. Finally, a substantial nexus between available energy (Rn-G) and ETa informed the available energy, influenced by NDVI to be the primary driver of these oases' transpiration. This study provides essentials of near-surface energy fluxes and the likelihood of ETa with considerable baseline inferences for Yanqi that may be beneficial for long-term investigations that will attend in agrometeorological services and sustainable management of water resources in semi-arid regions.

However, stressors such as climate change, land use, or land-cover change threaten the ecological functions of lakes. National and international legislations address these threats and establish consistent, long-term monitoring schemes. Remote sensing techniques based on the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have recently been demonstrated to provide accurate and low-cost spatio-temporal views for the assessment of the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems and the identification of areas at risk of contamination. Few studies have been carried out so far on the employment of these tools in the monitoring of lakes. Therefore, high-resolution UAV surveys were used to analyse and evaluate natural and anthropogenic impacts on the habitat status of a volcanic lake in a protected area. Five UAV flights took place during a year-long cycle (November 2020 to November 2021) in a volcanic lake located in southern Italy. For each flight performance, an orthomosaic of georeferenced RGB images was obtained, and the different features of interest were monitored and quantified using automated processing in a GIS environment. The UAV images made it possible not only to estimate the flooded shores but also to detect the impact of human-made structures and infrastructures on the lagoon environment. It has been possible to observe how the rapid changes in lake-water level have led to the submersion of about 90.000 m(2) of terrain in winter, causing the fragmentation and degradation of habitats, while the connectivity of the natural ecosystem has been threatened by the presence of the road around the lake. The proposed methodology is rather simple and easily replicable by decision makers and local administrators and can be useful for choosing the best restoration interventions.

Several target options have been proposed, including sites that may harbor extant life and sites most likely to preserve evidence of past life. These sites have specific mineralogic characteristics. Extant life might be gathered around the sinters and associated mineral deposits of rare active fumaroles, or held within brine pockets and inclusions in a few evaporite-mineral deposits. Possibilities for fossilization include deltaic and lake-bottom sediments of once-flooded craters, sinters formed by ancient hot-spring deposits, and the carbonate deposits associated with some evaporite systems. However, the highly varied mineralogy of fossil occurrences on Earth leads to the inference that Mars, an equally complex planet, could host a broad variety of potential fossilizing deposits. The abundance of volcanic systems on Mars and evidence for close associations between volcanism and water release suggest possibilities of organism entrapment and mineralization in volcaniclastic deposits, as found in some instances on Earth. Thus the targets being considered for exploration include a wide variety of unique deposits that would be characterized by silica or various nonsilicate minerals. Beyond these "special" deposits and in the most general case, an ability to distinguish mineralized from uncemented volcanic detritus may be the key to success in finding possible fossil-bearing authigenic mineralogies. A prototype miniaturized X ray diffraction/X ray fluorescence (XRD/XRF) instrument has been evaluated with silica, carbonate, and sulfate minerals and with a basalt, to examine the capabilities of this tool in mineralogic and petrologic exploration for exo-biological goals. This instrument, CHEMIN (chemical and mineralogical analyzer), is based on an innovative low-power X ray tube, transmission geometry, and CCD collection and discrimination of diffracted and fluoresced X rays. The ability to accumulate and integrate the entire circumference of each complete Debye diffraction ring compensates for poor powder preparations, as might be produced by robotic sampling systems. With CHEMIN, a wide range of minerals can be uniquely identified. Using Rietveld analysis of the XRD results, mineral quantification is also possible. Expanded capabilities in phase analysis and constrained data solutions using quantitative XRD and XRF are within reach.

J	Varekamp, JC				Varekamp, Johan C.			The volcanic acidification of glacial Lake Caviahue, Province of Neuquen, Argentina	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Lake Caviahue (northern Patagonia, Argentina) is a large glacial lake acidified by volcanic fluids from Copahue volcano. The lake and the feeding rivers were sampled annually from 1997 till early 2006, including the eruptive period of 2000. Lake Caviahue waters evolved over time, with the most concentrated waters in 2000 during the eruptive period, followed by gradual dilution that was interrupted by renewed acidification in 2003-2004. Inversion of the lake water data and application of a dynamic non-steady state model for the lake provides our best quantitative estimates for the variation in element fluxes over the 9-year period. The model flux results agree well with most of the measured fluxes. The Copahue hydrothermal system had gently declining element fluxes between 1997 and mid-1999, although the lake was still becoming more concentrated. About 2-3 months before the 2000 eruption, element fluxes increased strongly, but the hydrothermal fluxes almost shutoff directly after the main eruptive events. The fluxes of several elements recovered post-2001, with an increase in element fluxes in 2003-2004; the lake became more dilute between 2004 and 2006. The intrusion of new magma into the hydrothermal system just prior to the 2000 eruption led to enhanced water rock interaction, with higher concentrations of the rock forming elements in the fluids, and the hot spring flow rate increased as a result of the higher pressure in the reservoir. The fluids became saturated in alunite and jarosite, and they were already saturated with anhydrite. Precipitation of these minerals possibly led to a decreased permeability of the hydrothermal reservoir, leading to the strongly reduced element fluxes just after the eruption. In addition, K, Al and S were retained in the newly precipitated minerals as well, further diminishing their export. The acidification in 2003-2004 may have resulted from a new small intrusion of magma or resulted from seismic activity that created new permeability and fresh rock surfaces for water rock interaction. The volcano is a significant source of toxic trace elements such as F, As, B and Li as well as a nutrient (P) for the local watershed. Monitoring of the hydrothermal fluids in the river that drains Copahue, especially the S/Cl, Mg/Cl and Mg/K values as well as the magnitude of the element fluxes would provide the best information for eruption forecasting for this volcano.

J	Stickney, M				Stickney, Michaela			Building bridges, fording streams, reaching agreement in the Lake Champlain basin: Alternatives to legislation and regulation rooted in citizen and science-based approaches to inspire watershed protection	WATER SA					Symposium on Hydrology for Environment, Life and Policy (HELP) in Action - Local Solutions to Global Water Problems	NOV 04-09, 2007	Johannesburg, SOUTH AFRICA	Dept Water Affairs & Forestry S Africa				Challenges and opportunities arise when jointly managing international waters shared by two countries and two states with different political and governmental systems. Lake Champlain's vast watershed is shared by the states of Vermont and New York in the United States of America and the Province of Quebec in Canada. Transboundary relations are characterised by consensus reached through a continuous sequence of non-binding, non-regulatory environmental agreements. Since the historic 1988 Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Cooperation on the Management of Lake Champlain, 16 additional agreements have been signed - averaging nearly one per year. They range from joint declarations and watershed plans to phosphorus standards and toxic spill responses. They are renewable agreements bearing the support and participation of state, provincial and federal agencies; local government; and businesses with a very strong citizen component. This progression of cooperative agreements falls under the auspices of the Lake Champlain Basin Program, a quasi-governmental partnership among Vermont, New York and Quebec that coordinates Lake Champlain's long-term management plan, Opportunities for Action: An Evolving Plan for the Future of the Lake Champlain Basin. The Lake Champlain Basin Program achieves significant watershed improvements through its consensus-based, decision-making policies bolstered by state-to-state, state-to-province agreements. This incremental approach, steeped in multi-level partnerships and institutions, epitomises the theory of natural resource regimes which emphasise roles of intermediate institutions in environmental management. Use of non-binding, renewable agreements more easily bridges differences among jurisdictions, whether interstate, intrastate or international. Additionally, such agreements can be updated more immediately as new information and technologies emerge. Voluntary, renewable agreements can be assembled more quickly than pursuing a traditional regulatory or legislative response. It is precisely the voluntary nature of these agreements and their successes that has captured the attention of other basins worldwide as a model for replication and reaching agreement on difficult issues.																			0378-4738						2008	34	4					468	475																WOS:000261307800007
J	Rougvie, JR; Carlson, WD; Copeland, P; Connelly, JN				Rougvie, JR; Carlson, WD; Copeland, P; Connelly, JN			Late thermal evolution of Proterozoic rocks in the northeastern Llano Uplift, central Texas	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The Llano Uplift of central Texas, USA contains large exposures of polydeformed Grenvillian metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks that were intruded by late- to post-orogenic granites. New U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar Single mineral ages and Rb-Sr mineral isochrons document the retrograde cooling history that followed Grenville-age metamorphism in the north-central and northeastern Llano Uplift, and explain discrepancies between previous U-Pb crystallization ages and younger determinations based on Rb-Sr and K-Ar isotopic systems. Dating has been carried out in the Valley Spring Gneiss (VSG) and the post-tectonic Lone Grove Pluton (LGP) in three areas of the Llano Uplift, from west to east: VSG rocks in the Babyhead area north of Llano, Texas, yielding hornblende, muscovite and biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages and Rb/Sr mineral isochron ages from similar to 1098 to similar to 1014 Ma; a sample from the LGP at Petrick Quarry, yielding U-Pb titanite and hornblende and biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages from similar to 1096 to similar to 1076 Ma; and VSG samples from the Inks Lake area in the eastern Llano Uplift, yielding U-Pb titanite, hornblende and biotite 40Ar/39Ar, and Rb-Sr mineral isochron ages from similar to 1087 to similar to 1029 Ma. Titanite from the Oatman granite to the southwest of these areas yields a U-Pb age of 1119 +/- 6 Ma. These ages, combined with closure-temperature estimates, document cooling in the Llano Uplift from similar to 1100-1000 Ma at rates between 5 and 14 degrees C Ma(-1). Although rapid uplift following early high-pressure metamorphism has important regional thermal effects, the cooling rates documented in this study are interpreted to represent the relaxation of local geotherms following local magmatic activity. The low-temperature history documented in this study is probably unrelated to uplift rates. This supports the suggestion that magmatic heating was an important factor in the late high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphism of the Llano region. It further suggests that the late pressure and temperature conditions recorded in the rocks were likely not synchronous across the region. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the north and middle basins have not been the object of high-resolution palynological reconstructions. This new study presents the pollen, spores and dinoflagellate cysts records obtained from a 10 m-long sediment core recovered in the middle basin, which currently has brackish waters and is surrounded by arid and semi-arid vegetation. An age-depth model built based on six radiocarbon dates on ostracod shells indicates that the sequence spans the period from 14.47 to 2.43 cal. ka BR The present palaeoenvironmental study focuses on the top 666 cm, or from 12.44 to 2.43 cal. ka BR At the vegetation level, the Younger Dryas is characterised by an open landscape dominated by desert vegetation composed by Amaranthaceae with shrubs and salt-tolerant plants. However, although the Early Holocene is also characterised by desert vegetation, it is enriched in various shrubs such as Ephedra and Calligonum, but tree expansion is not important at the Holocene onset. After a major shift at 8.19 cal. ka BP, the Middle Holocene displays now both the character of desert and of steppe, although some trees such as Quercus and Corylus slightly spread. The Late Holocene records steppe vegetation as dominant, with more tree diversity. Regarding the lacustrine signal, the dinocyst assemblage record fluctuates between slightly brackish conditions highlighted by Pyxidinopsis psilata and Spiniferites cruciformis, and more brackish ones similar to the present day with the dominance of Impagidinium caspienense. The Late Pleistocene is characterised by low salinities, related to the Khvalynian highstand. From 11.56 cal. ka BP, slightly more saline waters are reconstructed with an increase of L caspienense for a period of 1000 years, which could be attributed to the Mangyshlak lowstand. From 10.55 cal. ka BP, low salinity conditions return with remains such as Anabaena and Botryococcus abundant until 8.83 cal. ka BP, followed by a slow, progressive decrease of P. psilata and S. cruciformis until 4.11 cal. ka BP, which is the main assemblage change at lacustrine scale. Since then, higher salinities, similar to the present one, are reconstructed. Finally, Lingulodinium machaerophorum starts its development only at 2.75 cal. ka BP, in the Late Holocene. The present research revealed fundamental differences from previously published sea-level curves, in that a 6000 yr-long highstand suggested by low salinities is shown between 10.55 and 4.11 cal. ka BP. Amongst other arguments, using a comparison to a similar palynological regard but in the south basin, a N-S salinity gradient that is the reverse of the present one across the CS, suggests that the Amu Darya was flowing in the CS. Hence the CS levels during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene were influenced by a combination of precipitation over the high European latitudes and the indirect influence of the Indian summer monsoon over the Pamirs.

The cyclones were observed over the central Great Lakes region during the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment/Snowband Dynamics Project field campaign. The cyclones had different origins, with the first forming east of the Colorado Rockies and the second forming over the Gulf of Mexico. They were associated with different upper-level flow regimes, one located just north of a nearly zonal jet and the other located just west of a nearly meridional jet. Both storms produced heavy swaths of snow across the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. High-resolution observations of frontal structure were made during flights of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Electra aircraft using drop-sondes and the Electra Doppler Radar tail radar system. The high-resolution observations suggest a different arrangement of air masses in the trowal region compared with the classical occlusion model, where the trowal axis forms at the intersection of a warm front and a cold front that has overtaken and subsequently ascended the warm front. In both cyclones dry air intruded over the warm front, isolating the warm, moist airflow within the trowal airstream. Very sharp moisture gradients were present at the leading edge of the dry air in both cyclones. In each case, relative humidity differences of over 50% were observed over distances of 10-20 km. The thermal gradient near the leading edge of the dry air in one cyclone was diffuse, so that the moist-dry boundary could best be characterized as an upper-level humidity front. In the other cyclone, the thermal gradient was sharper and aligned with the moisture boundary and was best characterized as a cold front aloft. The analyses suggest that the classical conceptual model of the trowal, at least in some cyclones such as the two illustrated here, needs to be revised to include the possibility that the warm moist airstream aloft may sometimes be bounded on its south side by an upper-level front rather than a surface-based cold front. Since the two cyclones discussed here had different origins, tracks, and flow regimes, the similarity of their structure suggests that these features may be common.					; Han, Mei/H-2344-2012	Han, Mei/0000-0001-5218-8728; Rauber, Robert/0000-0003-2880-6148; Grim, Joseph/0000-0002-8776-5860													0027-0644					MAY	2007	135	5					1629	1646		10.1175/MWR3378.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR3378.1													WOS:000246366700001

This idea is illustrated in an iconic plot in planetary science, the so-called Urey-Craig (UC) diagram, where the amount of iron accommodated in sulfides and metallic alloys is plotted versus that found in oxides and silicates. Hydrous carbonaceous chondrites (i.e., CI and CM type) are usually considered as the oxidized end-member. Here, we reevaluate the position of CIs in the UC diagram based on available data from recent space missions that sampled CI-like materials and by a recently found CI meteorite (Oued Chebeika 002) using X-ray diffraction and Mo<spacing diaeresis>ssbauer spectroscopy. Moreover, we report new data for C2-ungrouped (e.g., Tagish Lake and Tarda), CM, and CR chondrites containing varying proportions of clay minerals. The results show that the recently fallen CI and C2-ungrouped samples contain a considerable amount of iron sulfides, and metallic iron was identified in less altered CM samples, indicating that they are not completely oxidized. The updated UC diagram shows that the formation environments of CI materials are much more reduced than previously assumed, possibly implying that the oxygen fugacity that prevailed during CI material formation might not be far from that of some non-carbonaceous chondrites (e.g., L and LL type). Furthermore, the metal-bearing CM samples have Fe3+-rich poorly-crystalline phases, and the Fe3+/(Fe3++Fe2+) ratio in clay minerals decreases with increasing alteration intensity. The CI and C2-ungrouped samples do not follow this CM trend, suggesting distinct redox-controlling processes.

The Rise and Fall of Marpha Lake, a Late Quaternary Dammed Lake in the Himalayan Rain-Shadow With Implications to Landscape Evolution and Sediment Dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Understanding landscape evolution history and sedimentary dynamics in high mountainous regions is tampered by rapid erosion of the sedimentary archives. Naturally dammed lakes provide unique snapshots of these processes and enable evaluating these processes under climatic conditions different from the present. Marpha Lake, in the Himalayan rain-shadow of the upper Kali Gandaki, central Nepal, with its similar to 450 m thick lacustrine sequence provides a rare opportunity to study these processes. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) of quartz and feldspars was used to date the full sequence of filling, breaching and sediment evacuation of the lake. The results show that the lake initiated at similar to 120 ka and sediment accumulated until similar to 80 ka, corresponding to the intense monsoon period of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. The calculated minimum catchment erosion rate during the lake filling is typical of modern erosion rates of the Himalayan rain shadow (similar to 150 mm/ka). The lake was breached at similar to 30 ka and the majority of sediments were evacuated within 10 kyr. Between 80 and 30 ka, there was little sedimentation, corresponding to the Last Glacial period (MIS 2-4) associated with weaker Indian monsoon and possible ice coverage of the lake's drainage basin down to the elevation of the lake. Breaching of the dam may have been the result of ice pressure from the lake and/or ice build-up in the pores within the dam. Thus, the sediments of Marpha Lake provide a fascinating archive for understanding how the interplay between mass movement and climate shaped the Himalayan rain shadow morphology during the Late Quaternary.

Traditional ways of teaching logic design using discrete components (TTL: Transistor-Transistor Logic and CMOS: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors) have been replaced by Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD: Complex Programmable Logic Devices and FPGA) [1, 2, 3]. Today, a more standard development process is widely used in industry. The process uses Hardware Description Languages as a design entry to describe the digital systems. The two most widely used Hardware Description Languages in industry are VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) and Verilog (Verifying Logic). Although most traditional electrical and computer engineering programs have updated their curriculum to include topics in hardware description language and programmable logic design (FPGA/CPLD), two-year and four-year electrical engineering technology programs have fallen behind and are moving slowly in updating their curriculum. A survey of 107 two-year electrical engineering technology programs and 52 four-year electrical engineering technology programs showed that only 16.5% of two-year and only 19.5 % of four-year programs in electrical and computer engineering technology at US academic institutions currently have a curriculum component in hardware description language and programmable logic design [5]. Clearly, electrical engineering technology programs are far behind in teaching the skills that represent current and future industry needs. The School of Technology at Michigan Technological University in partnership with College of Lake County is stepping up to this challenge by developing and introducing curriculum in hardware description languages and programmable logic design. This paper will discuss the curriculum development and course assessment results at Michigan Technological University Electrical Engineering Technology Program and The partner Community College. The paper also addresses project activities including the two-day Faculty Professional Development workshop on VHDL and FPGA design implemented in December 2012, assessment results and lessons learned, and finally, the undergraduate research experience at Michigan Technological University.																			2153-5965						2013																								WOS:000367454801045

The New Lake Champlain Bridge design process	MODERN TECHNIQUES IN BRIDGE ENGINEERING					6th New York City Bridge Conference on Modern Techniques in Design, Inspection, Monitoring and Rehabilitation of Bridge Structures	JUL 25-26, 2011	New York City, NY					The Lake Champlain Bridge, also known as the Crown Point Bridge, was an historic steel truss bridge stretching 2,187 feet across Lake Champlain between Crown Point, New York, and Chimney Point, Vermont. After significant deterioration was discovered in the unreinforced concrete bridge piers in the fall of 2009, the bridge was abruptly closed to all traffic. An emergency declaration was issued by the Vermont Agency of Transportation and by New York State. HNTB prepared a Safety Assessment Report, and together with New York and Vermont, concluded that the existing truss bridge should be demolished. The two regions connected by the bridge are economically linked and share services, including hospitals and fire departments. Given the criticality of the bridge for the regional economies, it was imperative that the design and construction of a replacement bridge be expedited as soon as possible. Together with New York, Vermont, and the FHWA, the HNTB design team developed plans for the demolition of the original truss bridge and the design and construction of a new network tied arch bridge. Utilizing design-bid-build contracting methods, the demolition of the existing deteriorated bridge, and the design and construction a new signature crossing was to be completed within twenty months. This paper discusses reasons for the bridge closure and the innovative design-bid-build approach that enabled an extremely expedited replacement of the Lake Champlain Bridge. The design was completed under a compressed schedule with traditional linear functions done concurrently with bid advertisement, packaging and permitting. The teamwork between the two states and numerous local and federal agencies allowed for a cooperative process that can serve as a model for success in collaboration amongst various agencies and interest groups, thus aiding in significant time and cost savings. Topics of the paper include multi-agency coordination, the importance of the public involvement process, environmental process, design methodology, constructability, and measures taken to expedite bridge construction.

J	Timperley, MH; Hill, LF				Timperley, MH; Hill, LF			Discharge of mercury from the Wairakei geothermal power station to the Waikato River, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The Wairakei geothermal power station on the west bank of the Waikato River 10 km north of Lake Taupo, New Zealand, discharges a warm mixture of cooling water and geothermal steam condensate to the river. This discharge contains at least two chemical species of mercury (Hg): elemental mercury (Hg-0) at a mean concentration of 42 mu g m(-3); and other unidentified species, not reducible by acidic stannous chloride, at a mean concentration of 79 mu g m(-3). The annual discharge to the river of total Hg is 46.5 kg (CI95 42.0-51.8) of which 19.3 kg (CI95 18.3-20.0) is Hg-0. On average 53 g d(-1) of Hg-0 is discharged from the Wairakei station to the river and 50 g d(-1) of Hg-0 flows out of Lake Aratiatia, the reservoir formed for the Aratiatia hydro-electric power station 3 km down-stream from the Wairakei station. The residence time of the condensate in Lake Aratiatia varies between 1.5 h at high river flow and 12 h during winter when water is accumulated in the lake overnight. The warm condensate initially floats on the surface of the river but only a small proportion of the Hg-0 is lost to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the short residence time of the condensate in the lake probably limits the extent to which other mechanisms can remove Hg-0 from the river water. For these reasons it is concluded that most of the Hg-0 discharged to the river from the Wairakei station remains as Hg0 in the water flowing out of Lake Aratiatia. Fine-grained bed sediments in Lake Aratiatia are an insignificant sink for Hg because of their very small area and relatively low total Hg concentrations. It seems likely, therefore, that the non-reducible forms of Hg discharged with the condensate also remain in the river water and pass out of the lake.																			0028-8330					SEP	1997	31	3					327	336		10.1080/00288330.1997.9516770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1997.9516770													WOS:A1997YA25200004

Nutrient and Sulfate Variations along the Maumee River, Ohio, USA	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2019: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					World Environmental and Water Resources Congress / 19th Annual Congress of the Environmental-and-Water-Resources-Institute (EWRI) / EWRI History and Heritage Symposium	MAY 19-23, 2019	Pittsburgh, PA	Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers				Sulfate (S), nitrate (N), and phosphate (P) are the primary contaminants that contribute to harmful algae blooms (HABs). Combined with warm waters and sunlight, the photosynthetic blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) can flourish. Previous work has established Lake Erie's western basin as a point of origin for HABs due to its relatively shallow waters, which can quickly reach warm temperatures in the summer, and its proximity to the mouth of the 137 mile long Maumee River. The Maumee originates in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and flows northeast through largely agriculture dominated counties and numerous urban areas until it drains directly into Lake Erie's western basin. Along its flow path, the Maumee accumulates large amounts of contaminants from agricultural fertilizers, urban runoff, and bedrock. This research quantifies the contaminants present in the water and sediment of the lower similar to 60 miles of the Maumee River over the course of six months through monthly water quality monitoring at seven sampling points along the river and subsequent laboratory analysis of the samples. The results from the data collected for nutrients and sulfate in the water correlate with precipitation. Each contaminant (N, P, S) exhibit unique concentration patterns over time; each respond differently to precipitation events, which provide some insight about their sources. The results of this study have shown relationships between many of the measured parameters such as the correlations between dissolved oxygen (DO), organic matter (OM) in the sediments, pH, and phosphate concentration in the water. The data have shown that as OM increases, DO and pH decrease due to OM decomposition which releases CO2. With regard to phosphate, it is more soluble in lower pH waters. Considering that phosphate is one of the fundamental nutrients that fuel HAB development, this is an important relationship. It puts in evidence for the internal sources of phosphate as the minerals stored in the sediments. The input of contaminants into the western basin is not the only factor to consider with regard to HABs. Wind, water temperature, and currents combined with contaminant concentrations determine the presence and severity of HABs in Lake Erie.																					978-0-7844-8233-9				2019							321	333																WOS:000473308300033

An ∼11,200 year paleolimnological perspective for emerging archaeological findings at Quartz Lake, Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Wetlands and lakes in the Tanana Valley, Alaska, have provided important resources for prehistoric humans who inhabited this region. We examine an similar to 11,200 cal yr BP record of environmental and paleolimnological changes from Quartz Lake in the middle Tanana Valley. Our data are also presented in the context of recent archaeological findings in the lake's general vicinity that have 18 associated AMS C-14 dates. We analyzed the stable-carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of total organic matter from the core, coupled with oxygen and carbon isotope analyses of Pisidiidae shells (fingernail clams), in addition to chironomid assemblage changes. Lacustrine sediments began to accumulate at similar to 11,200 cal yr BP. Initially, autochthonous production was low and allochthonous organic input was negligible between 11,000 and 10,500 cal yr BP, and were associated with relatively cool conditions at Quartz Lake at similar to 10,700 cal yr BP. After 10,500 cal yr BP, autochthonous production was higher coincident with a shift to chironomid assemblages dominated by taxa associated with warmer summer climates. A decrease in delta C-13 values of total organic carbon (TOC) and organic content of the sediment between 9,000 and 4,000 cal yr BP may indicate declining autochthonous primary production. This period ended with an abrupt (similar to 7 %(0)) decrease in the delta O-18 values from Pisidiidae shells at similar to 3,000 cal yr BP, which we hypothesize represented an episodic connection (flood) of the lake with flow from the nearby (similar to 6 km) Tanana River. Our findings coincide with evidence for major flooding at other locations connected to the Tanana River and further afield in Alaska. From similar to 3,000 cal yr BP Quartz Lake subsequently appeared to become a relatively closed system, as indicated by the delta O-18(Pisidiidae) and delta C-13(Pisidiidae) data that are positively correlated and generally higher, which also correlates with a shift to moderately higher abundances of littoral chironomids. The cause of the transition to closed-basin conditions may have been geomorphic rather than climatic. This evidence of a progressively stronger evaporative influence on the lake's closed hydrology after similar to 3,000 cal yr BP is consistent with our modern delta O-18 and delta D water data from Quartz Lake that plot along a regional evaporative line we base on isotopic measurements from other local lakes and rivers.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Cwynar, Les/I-4214-2012	Wooller, Matthew/0000-0002-5065-4235; Bigelow, Nancy/0000-0001-5020-5002; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Gaglioti, Benjamin/0000-0003-0591-5253													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2012	48	1			SI		83	99		10.1007/s10933-012-9610-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9610-9													WOS:000304566900007
J	Blake, S; Rogers, N				Blake, S; Rogers, N			Magma differentiation rates from (226Ra/230Th) and the size and power output of magma chambers	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												We present a mathematical model for the evolution of the (Ra-226/Th-230) activity ratio during simultaneous fractional crystallization and ageing of magma. The model is applied to published data for four volcanic suites that are independently known to have evolved by fractional crystallization. These are tholeiitic basalt from Ardoukoba, Djibouti, MORB from the East Pacific Rise, alkali basalt to mugearite from Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, and basaltic andesites from Miyakejima, Izu-Bonin arc. In all cases (Ra-226/Th-230) correlates with indices of fractional crystallization, such as Th, and the data fall close to model curves of constant fractional crystallization rate. The best fit rates vary from 2 to 6 x 10(-4) yr(-1) . Consequently, the time required to generate moderately evolved magmas (F <= 0.7) is of the order of 500 to 1500 yrs and closed magma chambers will have lifetimes of 1700 to 5000 yrs. These rates and timescales are argued to depend principally on the specific power output (i.e., power output per unit volume) of the magma chambers that are the sites of fractional crystallization. Equating the heat flux at the EPR to the heat flux from the sub-axial magma chamber that evolves at a rate of ca. 3 x 10-4 yr(-1) implies that the magma body is a sill of ca. 100 m thickness, a value which coincides with independent estimates from seismology. The similarity of the four inferred differentiation rates suggests that the specific power output of shallow magma chambers in a range of tectonic settings covers a similarly narrow range of ca. 10 to 50 MW km(-3). Their differentiation rates are some two orders of magnitude slower than that of the basaltic Makaopuhi lava lake, Hawaii, that cooled to the atmosphere. This is consistent with the two orders of magnitude difference in heat flux between Makaopuhi and the East Pacific Rise. (Ra-226/Th-230) data for magma suites related by fractional crystallization allow the magma differentiation rate to be estimated and, from this, the thermal budget of the magma chamber addressed, and where an independent measurement of heat flux exists, to place constraints on the size of the magma chamber. Such results have the potential to constrain the likely timescale and size of future eruptions of evolved magmas. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Speciation, Size Fractionation and Transport of Trace Elements in the Continuum Soil Water-Mire-Humic Lake-River-Large Oligotrophic Lake of a Subarctic Watershed	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The concentration and size fractionation of major and trace elements (TEs) linked to organo-mineral colloids along the landscape gradient soil water-peat mire-humic lakes-river-large oligotrophic lake have been investigated within two watersheds located in the subarctic region (Karelia, Russia) in the summer base-flow period. A large volume of natural waters was filtered in the field using cascade filtration and ultrafiltration (UF) with a progressively decreasing pore size [100, 20, 10, 5, 0.8, 0.4, 0.22, 0.1, 0.046, 0.0066 (100 kDa), 0.0031 (10 kDa) and 0.0014 mu m (1 kDa)] followed by multi-elemental ICP-MS and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis. In situ dialysis with 10 and 1 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes was also conducted. According to the TE distribution among different size fractions in the continuum soil (mire)-humic lake-river-large lake, the following groups of elements could be distinguished: (1) elements significantly bound to the colloidal (1 kDa-0.22 mu m) fraction and decreasing the proportion of this fraction from the feeding lake and stream to the terminal oligotrophic lake (Fe, Ti and U); (2) colloidally dominated (>80 %) elements exhibiting similar size fractionation in all studied settings (Y, REEs, Zr, Hf and Th); (3) elements appreciably bound to colloids (20-40 %) in organic-rich soil and bog waters and decreasing their colloidal fraction to approximately 10 % in the oligotrophic lake (Mg, Ca, Sr, Rb and Mo); and (4) elements linked to the colloidal fraction (40-80 %) and not demonstrating any systematic variation between different landscape units (Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Mn, Zn and Pb). The in situ dialysis technique produced a similar picture of the colloidal size fractionation with generally lower proportions of elements in the colloidal fraction compared to the UF. Thermodynamic modeling of trace element speciation using available codes demonstrated that complexation with dissolved organic matter and adsorption at the surface of ferric colloids can adequately model the observed colloidal speciation of divalent metals. However, the modeling could not describe the distribution of trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates (TE3+,4+) among different size fractions and cannot reproduce the experimentally observed proportion of their colloidal forms. Therefore, coprecipitation with organo-ferric colloids should be considered to account for the partitioning of TE3+,4+ between truly dissolved (<1 kDa) and various colloidal fractions. It follows from the results of this study that autochthonous processes of organic matter fractionation, such as (1) transformation of initially allochthonous soil-derived colloids via photo-and biodegradation or (2) new organic ligand production by plankton and periphyton, cannot appreciably affect the distribution of TEs among various size fractions of colloids and particles along the landscape gradient from soil water to terminal lake. Thus, even crucial changes in the environmental conditions, such as the river discharge regime and relative lake versus bog coverage, surface water pH, pCO(2) and DOC changes that are likely to occur according to the "extreme" scenario of the climate warming in the Arctic, should not affect the size fractionation and, therefore, the potential aquatic lability and biodisponibility of TEs present as organic (divalent transition metals, alkaline earth metals) and organo-mineral (Fe, Al, insoluble trivalent and tetravalent elements and U) colloids.

Constraints on the evolution of the eastern margin of the Hearne craton: New data from the southwestern Rottenstone Domain, Trans-Hudson Orogen, Saskatchewan	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The Rottenstone Domain (RD) is a complex lithotectonic supracrustal belt of the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogen in Saskatchewan, Canada, located between the Archean Hearne craton and the juvenile Paleoproterozoic Reindeer Zone (RZ). Its evolution and crustal affinity have been under considerable debate in the past few de-cades, with most interpretations considering it to be part of RZ, but some hinting that certain elements might have affinities to the Archean hinterland. On the basis of bedrock mapping, U-Pb, Sm-Nd and lithogeochemical data, the rocks of the southwestern RD were subdivided into several lithodemic entities, which were used to reconstruct a plate tectonic framework for the western part of the Trans-Hudson Orogen during Orosirian time.A U-Pb zircon crystallization age of 2518 +/- 6 Ma and depleted mantle model age (TDM) of 2.8 Ga for an augen granite confirmed that the western part of RD is part of the Hearne craton. A newly discovered structural inlier at the eastern boundary of RD consists of a central unit of 2045 +/- 9 Ma augen granite, with TDM ages between 2.8 and 2.6 Ga, that was intruded into gneissic granite with a TDM of 3.3 Ga. The augen granite was interpreted as representing a rift-related granite, emplaced into Archean rocks of the Hearne craton. Two lithotectonic as-semblages, one dominated by feldspathic quartzite and psammite the other by migmatitic psammite-psammopelite, are in structural contact with the granitic inliers and have model ages of 2.6-2.4 Ga. One of the feldspathic quartzite samples contains detrital zircon age modes at 1910 and 1860 Ma, and lesser Archean modes. Both assemblages were likely deposited in a forearc basin to the 1.865-1.850 Ga Wathaman continental arc.Recognition of Archean components and metasedimentary assemblages with older model ages than those in the RZ to the east, suggest that this southern part of RD is more closely affiliated with the Hearne craton. The eastern edge of RD coincides with a mylonite zone (Howard Lake shear zone), which likely represents a fundamental, although multiply reactivated, structural break separating Archean granitoids and structurally overlying metasedimentary rocks from rocks of the more juvenile Reindeer Zone.

A 274-lake calibration data-set and inference model for chironomid-based summer air temperature reconstruction in Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A 274-lake calibration data-set for chironomid-based temperature reconstruction is presented which is based on the taxonomic amalgamation of a 117-lake data-set from Switzerland and a 157-lake data-set from Norway and Svalbard. Taxonomic consistency of the two data-sets was ensured by joint microscope sessions by the two involved analysts, re-identifying chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set to reach an identical taxonomic resolution as in the Norwegian data, and by double-checking selected samples of the Norwegian calibration data-set. The combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set contains information on the distribution of 154 chironomid taxa over a July air temperature range of 3.5-18.4 degrees C, a pH range of 4.7-8.8, and an altitudinal range of 5-2815 m asl from lakes in temperate, subarctic, arctic, and alpine environments. Inference models developed based on this data-set using weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression outperformed inference models based on maximum likelihood regression. After outlier deletion WA-PLS regression predicted July air temperature with a bootstrapped (cross-validated) root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 1.40 degrees C. Inference models developed from the separate regional data-sets have an RMSEP of 1.16 and 1.43 degrees C for the Norwegian and the Swiss calibration data-set, respectively. The WA-PLS inference model based on the Norwegian data-set adequately predicted July air temperature based on chironomid assemblages in the Swiss data-set (RMSEP 2.05 degrees C; r(2) 0.74). In contrast, the WA-PLS model based on the Swiss chironomid assemblages performed poorly in inferring July air temperatures based on the Norwegian chironomid assemblages (RMSEP 2.70 degrees C; r(2) 039). We attribute this discrepancy to the large proportion of chironomid taxa in Norwegian samples not represented in the Swiss data-set, the larger range of both pH and lake types included in the Norwegian calibration data-set, and the lack of some chironomid taxa with an arctic and boreal distribution in the Swiss data-set. The WA-PLS inference model based on the combined Swiss-Norwegian calibration data-set is the largest taxonomically consistent chironomid-based inference model available to date and outperforms other existing models if the r(2) and RMSEP relative to the overall temperature gradient are examined. We demonstrate that the combined model can reconstruct a larger range of temperatures when applied to fossil assemblages than models based on the Norwegian or Swiss calibration data-sets only. The combined data-set includes the majority of chironomid taxa expected in late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments of lakes from Northern, Eastern, and Central Europe as well as from southern European mountain lakes. The newly developed WA-PLS inference model is therefore well suited for developing continental-scale reconstructions of late Quaternary temperature change based on chironomid records from different parts of Europe.

J	Li, ZL; Yu, JW; Yang, M; Zhang, J; Burch, MD; Han, W				Li, Zonglai; Yu, Jianwei; Yang, Min; Zhang, Jing; Burch, Michael D.; Han, Wei			Cyanobacterial population and harmful metabolites dynamics during a bloom in Yanghe Reservoir, North China	HARMFUL ALGAE												A significant outbreak of odorous and toxic cyanobacteria occurred in Yanghe Reservoir, North China, in the summer of 2007. The dominant species was Anabaena spiroides and it was accompanied with the occurrence of very high concentrations of the odor metabolite geosmin. The event included two cycles of growth of A. spiroides: the first one of approximately 16 days between 21 June and 8 July, with the peak density 70,000 cells mL(-1) on 2 July, and the second smaller bloom of over 50 days between 9 July and the end of August. The bloom also included a range of species of Microcystis, predominantly M. aeruginosa, as the second largest population, which varied from 5800 cells mL(-1) to 28,000 cells mL(-1) in the first cycle and from 2000 cells mL(-1) to 11,000 cells mL(-1) in the second. Geosmin reached the peak value of 7100 ng L-1 on 3 July, which was the highest value ever reported. The average geosmin production potential for A. spiroides cells was approximately 0.1 pg cell(-1), which was also very high and 85-97% of geosmin was found within the cells and in addition the dissolved geosmin did not increase even during the cyanobacterial decay period. In addition to odor metabolites, three microcystin variants MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR and anatoxin-a, most of which were intracellular, were detected, with MC-RR being the dominant cyanotoxin. The highest cyanotoxin concentrations were: dissolved: MC-RR 1.56 mu g L-1, MC-YR 0.066 mu g L-1, MC-LR 0.544 mu g L-1, anatoxin-a 0.106 mu g L-1; intracellular: MC-RR 70.1 mu g L-1, MC-YR 3.76 mu g L-1, MC-LR 24.6 mu g L-1, anatoxin-a 0.184 mu g L-1, and these occurred on 2 July. The correlation between geosmin and A. spiroides was excellent (R-2 = 0.912), however the correlation between anatoxin-a concentrations and Anabaena densities and between MCs concentrations and Microcystis densities was not as strong. This study demonstrated the relatively complex requirement for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms in this lake in China, where both the range of odors and cyanotoxins can be produced in concentrations which can change rapidly over a short time along with the bloom composition. It also demonstrated that both odor compounds and cyanotoxins should be considered in terms of the potential hazard to public water supply when a bloom was dominated by Anabaena and Microcystis occurs.

We studied Recent/Subrecent and Late Glacial/Holocene sediments from Germany, Austria, Russia, and the U.S. to test for a correspondence between LCA distribution and surface water temperature in limnic systems. Previously, reports of LCA occurrence were restricted to sediments of 6 wide distributed freshwater and alkaline lakes. In this study 13 of 27 investigated lakes contained LCAs in surface sediments with concentrations varying between 12 to 205 mug/g TOC. Late Glacial to Holocene sediment sequences from Lake Steisslingen and Lake Wummsee, (Germany), Lake Pichozero (Russia), and Brush Lake (U.S.A.) contained abundant LCAs with averaged concentrations of 33 to 7536 mug/g TOC. For the first time we observed the occurrence of LCAs within in the water column of oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (NE-Germany). Alkenones were restricted to the zone of maximum chlorophyll concentration within the water column indicating that LCAs have a biosynthetic origin and can be attributed to phototrophic (micro)algae. Attempts to identify the producing organism, however, were not successful. Culture experiments allow various phytoplankton to be excluded as producers. Alkenone-producing algae are evidently of small size, hindering microscopical identification. LCAs commonly occur in high concentrations in Late Glacial sediments, mainly during the cold period of the Younger Dryas, whereas the Holocene usually is devoid of polyunsaturated alkenones. The episodic occurrence of LCAs restricts their utility as proxies for continuous geological records. Furthermore, lack of microscopical verification and the episodic distribution allow for different producers of unsaturated alkenones in Recent and Late Glacial sediments. An empirical relationship between LCA distribution and temperature was observed. In fossil sediments from Lake Steisslingen, there is a good correspondence between Uk37 and the temperature controlled delta O-18 isotope ratio of lake chalk. Comparison of LCA patterns obtained from the uppermost centimetres of lake sediments with averaged summer surface water temperatures of the lakes studied, demonstrates a trend of covariance (r(2): Uk'37 = 0.90, Uk37 = 0.67; n = 9). Hence, the same mechanism that causes temperature-dependence of LCA patterns in marine systems might be effective in limnic settings. Identification of alkenone producers and their culture under controlled temperature are still mandatory before LCAs can be routinely applied as paleotemperature proxy in limnic systems.

Source-rock potential of the lowest coal seams of the Marcelina Formation at the Paso Diablo mine in the Venezuelan Guasare Basin: Evidence for the correlation of Amana oils with these Paleocene coals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												The aims of this work were to carry out a combined petrographic, palynofacies, and organic geochemical study of twelve drill-core samples collected from the lowest coal seams in the Paleocene Marcelina Formation (Paso Diablo mine, Guasare Basin, northwestern Venezuela), to characterize crude oil samples from three wells in the nearby Amana Field and to evaluate oil-source correlations of these crude oils with the Paso Diablo coal extracts. The coals under study were classified as high volatile bituminous A or at the B-A boundary, and showed vitrinite contents between 50.0 and 89.4 vol.%, liptinites ranging from 1.4 to 24.2 vol.%, and inertinites in the 62-30.8 vol.% range. Results from organic geochemical investigations indicate that the Guasare coals were generated in a limno-telmatic to telmatic zone under fluctuating oxygen conditions. A Type III kerogen with relatively high hydrogen content and a thermal maturity corresponding to the early oil window are proposed for these coals as supported by Rock-Eval and petrographic data, as well as biomarker interpretations. Oil generation potential from Marcelina Formation coals is probably due to the perhydrous nature of the vitrinite, high bitumen contents, and considerable liptinite concentrations, mainly oil-prone resinites and exsudatinites. Palynofacies observations denote a dominance of psilate pollen grains related to angiosperm plants and, as expected, Type III kerogens or humic coals in the studied seams, the parent material of which contained a significant contribution of algae. The non-detection of 18 alpha(H)-oleanane does not preclude the fact that angiosperms are the dominant plants in the Guasare paleomire. On the other hand, the characterization of the Amana oils suggests that they all fall into a unique oil family; the presence of 25-norhopanes in them could indicate paleobiodegradation and mixing from various hydrocarbon charges in the reservoir. Thus, the crude oils from the Amana Field seem to be a mixture of one or more oil charges from the early mature marine carbonate source rocks of the La Luna Formation, deposited under anoxic reducing conditions, and a later pulse of hydrocarbon generation which originated from an unknown - so far - nonmarine source rock. In this regard, hydrocarbon liquid derived from the lowest Marcelina coal seams may be tentatively identified as the latter oil charge. Also, this work delineates some components of a currently subcommercial and hypothetical Tertiary petroleum system - identified and named as Marcelina/Misoa C5(.) - in the lake Maracaibo region. Finally, the coalbed gas contents of sampled coals were determined. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bright, J; Kaufman, DS				Bright, Jordon; Kaufman, Darrell S.			Amino acid racemization in lacustrine ostracodes, part I: effect of oxidizing pre-treatments on amino acid composition	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Bleaching biominerals reduces the concentration of amino acids to a residual fraction which is thought to be preserved within intra-crystalline proteins. Intra-crystalline amino acids represent a relatively closed-system and may be superior for amino acid geochronological and paleothermometry investigations. Here we quantify the effects of extended bleaching (to 144 h) on amino acid concentrations and D/L values in the valves of seven modern ostracode species. Then we compare the effects of increasingly aggressive pre-treatments (sonication, exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide for 2 h, and exposure to 10% bleach for 48 h) on amino acid concentrations and D/L values in fossil ostracode (Candona) valves from numerous locations throughout the western United States and northern Mexico. Bleaching modern ostracode valves results in a rapid order-of-magnitude reduction in amino acid concentrations and a slight increase in D/L values. Amino acid concentrations in five of the seven modern species increased slightly after prolonged exposure to bleach, suggesting that bleaching weakens a resistant protein source within the ostracode valves. Increasingly aggressive pre-treatments had virtually no effect on amino acid concentrations, D/L. values, or inter-sample variability in fossil Candona valves older than about 1 ka. Candona valves younger than about I ka showed a progressive decrease in amino acid concentrations with more aggressive oxidizing pre-treatments. Valves older than 1 ka generally had amino acid concentrations < 10 nM mg(-1). A delayed increase in amino acid concentrations (15-30 nM mg(-1)), followed by a gradual decrease to residual concentrations consistently < 10 nM mg(-1), was observed in both outcrop and core samples. We propose that a large amount of weakly bound proteins is leached geologically instantaneously from Candona valves. Long-term (10's of ka) diagenesis gradually weakens and then destroys a secondary pool of tightly bound proteins contained within the valves. Residual amino acid concentrations are likely derived from intra-crystalline proteins and resistant inter-crystalline proteins that are essentially immune to leaching. Candona valves deposited in pluvial Lake Chewaucan and exposed in sediments that crop out along the Ana River, Oregon, have unexpectedly well-preserved proteins and lower D/L values compared to fossil Candona valves of similar age from other locations. The Ana River results argue for developing site-specific calibrations for amino acid geochronology or paleothermometry studies that utilize ostracodes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

High-frequency paleoenvironmental evolution is an important controlling factor for the formation of small-scale sedimentary cycles. However, the driving factors of high-frequency paleoen-vironmental evolution and the formation process of sedimentary cycles under its constraint remain spec-ulative. In this study, which focuses on lacustrine shales, we find that the alternating deposition of variable thickness of organic-rich lamina (ORL) and silty-grained felsic lamina (SSFL) form sedimentary cycles on the micron to centimeter scale in the Chang 73 sub-member of the Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin. Based on detailed petrographic characterization, in-situ geochemical parameter testing, and high-resolution cycle analysis, the formation process of cyclical sedimentary records and related paleoenvironmental evolution are investigated. Three solar activity cycles were identified from the shales, namely the 360-500 yr, 81-110 yr, and 30-57 yr cycles (cycles I, II, and III, respectively). High -frequency paleoenvironmental evolution caused by solar activity induced lake-level fluctuation, which further controlled silty-grained sediment deposition and organic matter preservation in deep lake areas. Cycle I controlled relatively long-term lake-level fluctuation, driving several pairs of SSFL and ORL depo-sition at the centimeter scale. Cycles II and III were short-term cycles and acted on the millimeter to micrometer scale, further complicating the sedimentary strata forming during the period of lake-level fall induced by cycle I. The cyclic deposition of SSFL and ORL correspond to cycle III. Lake-level fluctuation influenced by cycle II mainly caused SSFL thickness variation in each lamina couplet. During the period of lake-level rise induced by cycle I, periods of lake level rise during cycles II, and III show cyclic variation in reducibility, and are not thought to control the supply of coarse-grained sediments in to the deep lake areas. Frequent lake-level fluctuation promotes lamina couplet formation in thickly-bedded shales, which creates favorable conditions for shale-oil accumulation. Oil produced from ORL can migrate-locally into dissolved feldspar porosity in SSFL and therefore is able to accumulate in shales, which creates high potential for future oil exploration in thickly-bedded lacustrine shales.(c) 2023 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Our results document lake level fluctuations in this lowland Neotropical region that were related to glacial-to-interglacial climate change during the Late Pleistocene. A bathymetric survey of Lake Peten Itza (area =100 km(2)) revealed a maximum water depth of similar to 160 m and the existence of a deep cryptodepression that extends 50 m below modern sea level. The great depth suggests that the basin held water even during arid conditions associated with full glacial periods. Lake Peten Itza may thus possess the only long continuous lacustrine sediment record of Late Pleistocene environmental and climate change in the lowland Neotropics. Two seismic reflection campaigns imaged the subsurface basin sediments that overlie basement. The sediment package was divided into four major seismic sequences (T, G, R, and B). Sequences are separated by unconformities that represent depositional cycles related to lake level fluctuations. Sediments of the uppermost sequence (T) were recovered and radiocarbon-dated in Kullenberg piston cores taken along a water depth transect. Seismic profiles reveal a basin-wide paleoshoreline just below sequence T at similar to 56 m below present lake level. This constructional feature formed during a lowstand of the last glacial period when the lake was reduced to only similar to 13% of its present volume. In cores taken landward of the paleoshoreline, Late Glacial-age deposits consist of paleosols, indicating subaerial exposure. Basinward of the shoreline, sediments are composed of dense gypsum sands and interbedded silty clays, reflecting authigenic gypsum formation under arid climate conditions. The top of the soil horizon and cessation of gypsum precipitation are represented by a strong seismic reflection (t). It marks the base of the uppermost seismic sequence T and is dated in several cores between similar to 11.1 and 10.2 cal kyr BP. Lake level rose quickly at this time in response to a shift from arid-to-humid climate conditions at the Late Glacial/Early Holocene transition. We infer a similar sediment response to climate variations in the older stratigraphic sequences (G, R, and B), related to earlier glacial-to-interglacial and stadial-to-interstadial cycles. Older sequences are also distinguished from one another by erosional unconformities that probably represent major lake level falls. Future recovery of the older stratigraphic record by drilling in Lake Peten Itza will provide ages for these older units and enable us to test the depositional model inferred from seismic stratigraphy.

J	Coshell, L; Rosen, MR; McNamara, KJ				Coshell, L; Rosen, MR; McNamara, KJ			Hydromagnesite replacement of biomineralized aragonite in a new location of Holocene stromatolites, Lake Walyungup, Western Australia	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Holocene stromatolites are described from Lake Walyungup, a coastal hyposaline lake in south-western Australia. At summer low water, this groundwater-fed depression comprises two permanent shallow water bodies and an ephemeral southern pool, set within an areally extensive littoral zone of variably cemented carbonate crust. Up to 5 m of organic-rich carbonate mud has been deposited within each of these basins in less than 7000 years. Stromatolites rim the water bodies with individual columns up to 2 m tall. Stromatolite-capped tepee structures in subparallel alignment are widespread in the littoral crust, suggesting a linkage between stromatolite growth and zones of groundwater discharge. Lake Walyungup stromatolites, regardless of external morphology and setting, are coarsely laminated and have aragonitic mesoclot microfabrics. These microfabrics are similar to those from lithified portions of active thrombolitic microbialites from nearby Lake Clifton. Hydromagnesite is a minor to subdominant phase (up to 47 wt%) of the carbonate mineral assemblage in Lake Walyungup. It occurs mainly in the littoral zone as a diagenetic replacement of precursor aragonite, particularly within the mesoclot fabric of stromatolites, but also in sediments (strandline and dune sand, crusts) derived mainly from erosion of stromatolites. In contrast with nonreplaced and impermeable inorganic aragonitic cements, stromatolite mesoclots are micropermeable. Micropermeability is inferred to facilitate hydromagnesite diagenesis. Dolomite is also present in minor amounts as a pore fill in stromatolites, and as a subdominant to dominant (up to 100 wt%) phase in thin, mudcracked micrite layers within the crust package. The layered dolomite may be precipitated directly from the lake water. Major element abundance of the lake water is: Na+ > Mg2+ much greater than K+ > Ca2+ for cations, and Cl- much greater than SO42- approximate to HCO3- > CO32- for anions. Compared to other nearby coastal lakes, Lake Walyungup has a high pH (> 9.0), and an extremely high molar Mg/Ca ratio of > 90. Groundwater in the area has a Mg/Ca ratio generally less than 1. The unusual Mg/Ca ratio in Lake Walyungup is partially a result of in-lake processes with additional minor contribution of Mg2+ sourced from basal marine sand because no Mg-rich bedrock source has been found in the region.

The magnitude and spatial pattern of changes indicate that mussels had a significant impact on nutrients in Saginaw Bay. Annual means for total suspended solids, particulate organic carbon, particulate phosphorus, and particulate silica in the inner bay were significantly lower in 1992 and 1993 (post-zebra mussel) than in 1991 (pre-zebra mussel). Annual means decreased from 11.5 mg L(-1), 1.45 mg C L(-1) (121 mu M), 20.4 mu g P L(-1)(0.66 mu M), and 1.52 mg SiO2 L(-1) (24 mu M) respectively in 1991 to 4.4 mg L(-1), 0.79 mg C L(-1) (66 mu M), 11.2 mu g P L(-1) (0.36 mu M), and 0.77 mg SiO2 L(-1) (12 mu M) in 1993. In contrast, there were no significant differences among years for these parameters at control stations, which were located in the outer bay and had no known populations of mussels. Annual means for nitrate, ammonium, and silica were significantly higher in the inner bay in 1992 than in 1992, but not significantly different in 1993. Means increased from 0.39 mg N L(-1), 21.0 mu g N L(-1), and 1.11 mg SiO2, L(-1) respectively in 1991 to 0.47 mg NL(-1) 30.9 mu g N L(-1), and 1.71 mg SiO2 L(-1) in 1992. No significant differences were observed for these parameters in the control 2 group. Differences between 1992 and 1993 may reflect differences in the amount of runoff and circulation between Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron. A phosphorus budget indicated that zebra mussels were a significant sink for phosphorus. Mussels from the inner bay accumulated 108, 682, and 52 t respectively in 1991, 1992, and 1993. Comparatively, the annual pool of phosphorus in the water column of the inner bay decreased from a pre-zebra mussel (1979-1980) average of 712 t to 421 and 382 t in 1992 and 1993 respectively.

However, individuals performing DVM incur several trade-offs since they might suffer from resource limitation and a slower instantaneous birth rate in deeper depths. DVM patterns may be modified by abiotic factors such as temperature, food concentration, or pH and vary among different Daphnia species and genotypes. Furthermore, Daphnia host a variety of microparasites that might pose an additional factor influencing DVM behaviour. For infected individuals, migration into cooler temperature layers might slow down parasite growth. Moreover, parasites can increase opacity of their hosts. Non-migrating individuals might then be selectively purged from the upper layers by visually hunting predators. With these premises we asked, whether epidemics of the ichthyosporean parasite Caullerya mesnili affect or are affected by the DVM behaviour of Daphnia in Lake Greifensee, Switzerland by analysing the vertical distribution of Daphnia during day and night on two dates. Furthermore, we were interested whether a potential interaction depends on host genotype. We therefore studied the genotypic composition of the integrated population in regular sampling intervals over the course of one year and on a fine-grained vertical resolution during the Caullerya epidemic in late summer. Since Caullerya-infected Daphnia migrated equally well as uninfected ones, the findings of this study suggest that Caullerya epidemics neither affected nor were affected by the DVM behaviour of Daphnia. We observed clonal succession in the lake but could not link this succession to the Caullerya epidemic; all except one of the common multilocus genotypes were under-infected. In addition, outbreak and course of this Caullerya epidemic seemed to rely mainly on environmental cues. Because this first study only provides a snapshot of time, we hope that further studies will be done to verify our results.

That and marsh, fed by springs derived from mountain snowpack, differs in climate and hydrology from glaciated potholes of the northern prairies where most Canvasbacks breed. Fourteen years of nesting data on Canvasbacks over a 31 year period (1970-2000) were analyzed to determine factors affecting breeding performance at Ruby Lake and whether they differed from those in the prairies. Long-term Mayfield nest success at Ruby Lake (50% of all nests) was in the range of that in the northern prairies (21-65%). Of all Canvasback nests, 73% were parasitized (mostly by Redheads [Aythya americana]) as compared to 83-97% in a large Manitoba marsh and 57-65% in Manitoba potholes. However, as in the northern prairies, nest parasitism generally had little or no effect on either nest success or percentage of host eggs that hatched. In Manitoba potholes, nest success was unrelated to habitat variables measured; but successful nests at Ruby Lake were over shallower water, farther from shore, in wider bands of emergent vegetation, and surrounded by lower stem densities than unsuccessful nests. Water level is the key factor in breeding performance of Canvasbacks at both Ruby Lake and the northern prairies; however, the source of water differs (mountain snowpack at Ruby Lake, direct precipitation in the prairies) and effects of water-level variations are reversed. In small prairie potholes (mostly <0.4 ha) with many mammalian predators, productivity of Canvasbacks (which build floating nests) is increased by high water that floods the emergent fringe. At Ruby Lake, a very large marsh (2,830 ha) with mostly avian predators, Canvasback productivity is decreased by high water that floods interior emergent stands too deeply. Water level at Ruby Lake was highly correlated (multiple R-2 = 0.91) with mountain snowpack up to three years earlier, emphasizing the strong effect of climatic variations on wetland birds in that and region.

J	Kuhle, M				Kuhle, Matthias			Critical approach to methods of glacier reconstruction in high Asia and discussion of the probability of a Qinghai-Xizang(Tibetan) Inland ice	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												This overview discusses old and new results as to the controversy on the past glacier extension in High Asia, which has been debated for 35 years now. This paper makes an attempt to come closer to a solution. H.v. Wissmann's interpretation (1959) of a small-scale glaciation contrasts with M. Kuhle's reconstruction (1974) of a large-scale glaciation with a 2.4 million km(2) extended Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) inland glaciation and a Himalaya-Karakorum icestream network. Both opinions find support but also contradiction in the International and Chinese literature (Academia Sinica). The solution of this question is of supraregional importance because of the subtropical position of the concerned areas. In case of large albedo-intensive ice surfaces, a global cooling would be the energetical consequence and, furthermore, a breakdown of the summer monsoon. The current and interglacial heat-low above the very effective heating panel of the Qinghai-Xizang (Tibetan) Plateau exceeding 4000 m, which gives rise to this monsoon circulation, would be replaced by the cold-high of an inland ice. In addition, the plate-tectonically created Pleistocene history of the uplift of High Asia - should the occasion arise up to beyond the snowline (ELA) - would attain a paleoclimatically great, perhaps global importance. In case of a heavy superimposed ice load, the question would come up as to the glacio-isostatic interruption of this primary uplift. The production of the loesses sedimentated in NE-China and their very probable glacial genesis as well as an eustatic lowering of the sea-level by 5 to 7 m in the maximum case of glaciation are immediately tied up with the question of glaciation we want to discuss. Not the least, the problems of biotopes of the sanctuary-centres of flora and fauna, i.e., interglacial re-settlement, are also dependent on it. On the basis of this Quaternary-geomorphological-glaciological connection, future contributions are requested on the past glaciation, the current and glacial permafrost table and periglacial development, the history of uplift, and the development of Ice Age lakes and loess, but also on the development of vegetation and fauna in High Asia.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				JUN	2007	4	2					91	123		10.1007/s11629-007-0091-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-007-0091-7													WOS:000254540200001

Influence of cultural eutrophication, climate, and landscape connectivity on 3 Kawartha lakes (Ontario, Canada) since the early 1800s	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Laird KR, Li S, Gushulak CAC, Moir KE, Wang Y, Leavitt PR, Cumming BF. 2023. Influence of cultural eutrophication, climate, and landscape connectivity on 3 Kawartha lakes (Ontario, Canada) since the early 1800s . Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX.Paleolimnological analyses of 3 lakes within the Trent-Severn Waterway (TSW) were examined to evaluate the role of regional land-use practices (forestry and agriculture), climate change, and landscape position on cultural eutrophication and lake response over the past similar to 200 yr. The lakes were selected to represent lake position along the chain of lakes of the TSW; these 3 lakes vary in lake-water conditions from a lower nutrient headwater lake (Cameron Lake) to more nutrient-rich sites (Pigeon and Stony lakes) downstream. Diatom-inferred total phosphorus (TP) concentrations estimate that all lakes had TP levels of similar to 15 mu g/L in the 1700s, which increased to similar to 20-30 mu g/L in the 1800s and 1900s. Significant changes in diatom and Cladocera assemblages circa the 1830s are consistent with increased water levels and elevated phosphorus conditions associated with the intensification of forest harvest, agriculture, and development of the TSW. Diatom-inferred TP levels varied among lakes since the early 1900s, declining in Cameron Lake, increasing in Pigeon Lake, and stabilizing in Stony Lake, reflective of landscape position, degree of water inflow from the northern forested regions, and responsiveness of basins to point-source nutrient reductions and climate change. Timing of changes in TP, and changes in planktonic community composition varied among lakes. Lake production (as pigments) increased coherently in 2 lakes over the past similar to 20 yr, and modern algal composition (diatoms and pigments) are lake specific and unique in comparison to the last similar to 200 yr, likely reflecting combined effects of climate change and changes in nutrient loading.

J	DALRYMPLE, GB; RYDER, G				DALRYMPLE, GB; RYDER, G			40AR/39AR AGE SPECTRA OF APOLLO-15 IMPACT MELT ROCKS BY LASER STEP-HEATING AND THEIR BEARING ON THE HISTORY OF LUNAR BASIN FORMATION	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												We have obtained 26 high-resolution (16-51 steps) 40Ar/39Ar age spectra using a continuous laser system on submilligram fragments of recrystallized melt and single-crystal plagioclase clasts from 12 Apollo 15 impact melt rocks collected at the Apennine Front where the Imbrium and Serenitatis basins intersect. These melt rocks represent a wide range of compositions and at least half a dozen different impacts. Six of the melt rocks have reproducible, intermediate-temperature plateaus over 40% or more of the 39Ar released; the plateaus are interpreted as crystallization (impact) ages and much of the non-plateau behavior is attributable to recoil. Samples 15294,6,21, 15304,7,69, 15314,26,156, 15357,15, and 15359,12 have mean 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages that are statistically indistinguishable and fall within the narrow range 3852 +/- 14 (2sigma) Ma to 3870 +/- 12 Ma with a weighted mean of 3865 +/- 5 Ma. Sample 15356,9 has a mean plateau age of 3836 +/- 11 Ma and may represent a distinctly younger impact. A seventh sample (15314,30,158) has a peculiar but reproducible double plateau; a low-T one at 3873 +/- 9 Ma, which we think records the crystallization age, and a high-T one of 3831 +/- 10 Ma, which we interpret as an experimental (39Ar recoil) artifact. Four of the remaining melt rocks (15308,9, 15414,2,37, 15436,2, 15445,253) have complex 40Ar/39Ar age spectra that indicate that they either formed in or were disturbed by impacts that occurred less-than-or-equal-to 3850 Ma but did not completely reset the K-Ar isotopic system. Sample 15414,3,36 is different. Its spectrum may represent release mainly from clasts that were not well degassed in a melt event at 3870 Ma; the melt phase contains little potassium. Because most of the Apennine Front material must be coeval with or predate formation of the Imbrium Basin, it seems likely that the Imbrium impact is no older than 3870 Ma and probably no older than 3836 Ma. So far there is no convincing evidence in the lunar record for melt-producing impacts, such as basin formation, older than about 3.9 Ga.																			2169-9097	2169-9100				JUL 25	1993	98	E7					13085	13095		10.1029/93JE01222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JE01222													WOS:A1993LP80800001

To determine the main cause of soil pollution at coal gangues, several coal gangues in Guizhou Province, China that had undergone natural recovery via native plants for 8 years were investigated in summer 2019. Three plots (2 mx2 m) from the coal gangue area were selected for the treatment (GP). Control plots that were 100 m away from GP were also investigated in contrast (CK-near). In addition, plots from forest, farmland and lake land that were far from GP and largely undisturbed were also investigated as more extreme contrasts (CK-far). A series of soil indicators that can be affected by coal-gangue, such as heavy metals (Mn, Cr, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Pb), As, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), sulfur (S) and iron (Fe), were tested for in the plots. Plant species, coverage and height were also analyzed to uncover biodiversity and dominant species information. The results suggested that coal gangue significantly influences soil S, pH and plant species after 8 years of natural recovery. The CK-far plots contained relatively low soil sulfur content, normal pH (close to 7) and abundant plant biodiversity. Generally, pH related positively with both the Patrick (R=0.79, n=22, p<0.001) and Shannon indices (R=0.67, n=22, p<0.001); the soil S related negatively with both the Patrick (R=0.85, n=22, p<0.001) and Shannon indices (R=-0.79, n=22, p<0.001). S content was highest (S=1.0%) in GP plots, was lower in CK-near plots (S=0.3%) and was the lowest of all in the plots distant from the coal mine (S=0.1%, CK-far). S content was negatively correlated with pH. Soil pH decreased significantly, from 7.0 in CK-far, to 5.9 in CK-near, to 4.2 in GP. Soil Fe was 3.4 times higher in GP and CK-near than in CK-far. The excess sulfur and Fe elements and the acidified soil drove changes in soil and vegetation in the coal gangue areas. After 8 years of natural recovery, only a few plants, like Miscanthus floridulus, were able to live near the coal gangue in the area where the soil was still acidic and high in S and Fe.

Reduced nutrient retention, and more rapid removal, in catchments as a result of agricultural drainage of wetlands and lakes and channelisation or culverting of streams also play a role. Attempts have recently been made to reduce nutrient loading on lakes by intervening at the source level and by improving the retention capacity of catchment areas. The former measures include phosphorus stripping and nitrogen removal at sewage works, increased use of phosphate-free detergents, and regulations concerning animal fertiliser storage capacity, fertiliser application practices, fertilisation plans and green cover in winter. In order to improve nutrient retention capacity of catchments, wetlands and lakes have been re-established and channelised streams have been remeandered. In addition, cultivation-free buffer strips have been established alongside natural streams and there has been a switch to manual weed control. These measures have resulted in a 73% reduction of the mean total phosphorus concentration of point-source polluted streams since 1978; in contrast, there has been no significant change in the total nitrogen concentration. Despite the major reduction in stream phosphorus concentrations, lake water quality has often not improved. This may reflect a too high external or internal phosphorus loading or biological resistance. Various physico-chemical restoration measures have been used, including dredging and oxidation of the hypolimnion with nitrate and oxygen. Biological restoration measures have been employed in 17 Danish lakes. The methods include reducing the abundance of cyprinids, stocking with 0(+) pike ( Esox lucius) to control 0(+) cyprinids, and promoting macrophyte recolonization by protecting germinal submerged macrophyte beds against grazing waterfowl and transplanting out macrophyte shoots. In several lakes, marked and long-lasting improvements have been obtained. The findings to date indicate that fish manipulation has a long-term effect in shallow lakes, providing nutrient loading is reduced to a level so low as to ensure an equilibrium lake water phosphorus concentration of less than 0.05-0.1 mg phosphorus l(-1). If nitrogen loading is very low, however, positive results may be obtained at higher phosphorus concentrations. Macrophyte refuges and transplantation seem to be the most successful as restoration measures in the same nutrient-phosphorus regime as fish manipulation.

J	Marshall, BC; Henshaw, C; Evans, DA; Bleyl, K; Alder, S; Liou, TG				Marshall, BC; Henshaw, C; Evans, DA; Bleyl, K; Alder, S; Liou, TG			Influenza vaccination coverage level at a cystic fibrosis center - art. no. e80	PEDIATRICS												Background. Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Annual vaccination is the most effective means to prevent or attenuate this illness. The vaccine is recommended for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) older than 6 months, but the degree of adherence with this recommendation is unknown. Objectives. To determine 1) the vaccination coverage level for the 1997-1998 influenza season in a population of CF patients, and 2) the factors associated with nonadherence with vaccination. Design. Retrospective chart review, a mailed survey, and telephone interviews. Setting. Intermountain CF Center. This center, accredited by the CF Foundation, delivers health care to affected individuals throughout the Intermountain West. Care of children and adults is based at Primary Children's Medical Center and the University of Utah Hospital, respectively. The adjacent hospitals are comprehensive, tertiary care medical centers on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City. Approximately one third of the center's patient population lives in southern Idaho. There are 2 affiliate centers in Idaho, one based in Pocatello/Idaho Falls and the other in Boise. Patients. All patients over 6 months of age on the center's roster. Results. We found documentation of influenza vaccination status in the medical records of 99 patients; 98 who received the vaccine and 1 who did not because of an allergy to egg products. Through the mailed surveys and telephone interviews, we collected data on 236 additional patients. Thus, we report data on 335 (92.5%) of 362 patients on the center's roster. A total of 256 (76.4%) of 335 patients received the influenza vaccine before the 1997-1998 flu season, including 181 (79.4%) of 228 children (<18 years of age) and 75 (70.1%) of 107 adult patients (<= 18 years of age). We also analyzed the data assigning all patients to their major site of care, either the Salt Lake parent center or one of the Idaho affiliates. We found no difference in the vaccination rate when comparing parent center to affiliates: 179 (78.2%) of 229 patients at the parent center were vaccinated versus 77 (72.6%) of 106 patients at the affiliates. For the 79 patients who did not obtain the influenza vaccine, the major reasons were: "forgot," "too healthy," "too busy," "worried about the side effects," or "too sick at the time." The unvaccinated group had fewer clinic visits, fewer CF-related hospitalizations, and lived further from the care center than the vaccinated group. To further explore the association between contact with the center and vaccination status, we categorized patients into those who were evaluated in the outpatient clinic and/or hospitalized in 1997 and those who were not. We found that 80.8% of the 281 patients who actually received care at the center during 1997 were vaccinated as compared with only 59.5% of the 42 patients who did not receive care during that year. The timing of clinic visits also appears to be a critical factor. We found that 87.1% of patients who had a visit during the fourth quarter of the year had the vaccination as compared with 64.9% of patients who did not have a fourth quarter visit. A fourth quarter visit remained highly associated with vaccination in a logistic regression analysis, whereas number of clinic visits did not. Conclusions. The vaccination coverage level in this vulnerable population is higher than other high-risk groups of comparable age. Nonetheless, there is room for improvement. Strategies aimed at increasing patient contact with the CF center, particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year, may result in improved vaccination rates. Additional data encompassing a cross-section of CF centers would be helpful in ensuring that influenza vaccination is receiving adequate attention in this patient population. Systematic monitoring of influenza vaccination rates at a national level should be considered as a means of encouraging compliance with this important preventive measure.

J	Tigen, MG; Özcan, O				Tigen, Meltem Gunes; Ozcan, Osman			Assessment of spatial changes in Lake Karataş using remote sensing and GIS: ecological and hydrological transformation	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining hydrological balance, conserving biodiversity, and storing carbon. However, they are increasingly threatened by climate change, agricultural expansion, urbanization, and excessive water use. Lake Karata & scedil;, a critical wetland in T & uuml;rkiye that supports diverse avian and aquatic species, has experienced significant hydrological changes in recent decades. This study examines the spatiotemporal changes in the lake's surface area and its interaction with land use between 1985 and 2024 using remote sensing techniques. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS summer imagery were analyzed to assess water surface changes using the MNDWI, NDVI, and NDMI indices. The results indicate that Lake Karata & scedil;, which covered 11.45 km2 in 1985, had completely dried up by 2024, leading to biodiversity loss and the disappearance of aquatic habitats. According to CORINE land use data, between 1990 and 2018, permanently irrigated areas expanded by 21.78%, while dry farming areas decreased by 14.39%. These land use changes coincide with a significant decline in lake water levels, confirming that agricultural expansion has been a major driver of ecosystem degradation. Temporal analysis shows that between 1985 and 2005, lake surface fluctuations were primarily influenced by climatic factors, as indicated by proportional trends in the NDMI, MNDWI, and NDVI indices. However, after 2005, anthropogenic activities, particularly the expansion of irrigated agriculture, became the dominant cause of lake desiccation. To protect the Lake Karata & scedil; ecosystem and ensure sustainable water management, it is essential to regulate irrigated agriculture and prioritize regionally adapted crop production models. Key strategies include promoting drought-resistant crops, implementing high-efficiency irrigation systems, and adopting sustainable water management policies. This study highlights the effectiveness of remote sensing in monitoring long-term wetland transformations and identifying their primary drivers.

However, the dynamics of lacustrine organic carbon burial are more complex than marine systems, and the mechanisms linking it to global and regional tectonic-climatic factors remain poorly understood. Here, we present an organic carbon burial record from the Dongying paleolake in the Bohai Bay Basin during the middle Eocene, integrated with high-resolution reconstructions of terrestrial paleoclimate and paleolake environments, to elucidate the controls on organic carbon burial in large lacustrine systems. Our findings indicate that middle Eocene terrestrial paleoclimate evolution in the Bohai Bay Basin was modulated by both global and regional forcing, resulting in two climate transitions at similar to 43 Ma and similar to 42 Ma. The first transition is attributed to the southward migration of subtropical high pressure caused by global cooling, while the second transition is associated with regional factors, including the Tibetan Plateau uplift and Paratethys Sea retreat. Terrestrial paleoclimate profoundly influenced the co-evolution of paleolake environments and organisms, causing significant differences in the source, accumulation, and preservation of organic matter during different phases, along with notable variations in organic carbon burial. We propose that organic carbon burial in the large paleolakes of the Bohai Bay Basin was a response to global and regional climate changes. These findings highlight the climatic sensitivity of lacustrine organic carbon burial, which may in turn play a key role in climate regulation. This study enhances our understanding of lacustrine carbon burial potential, patterns, and mechanisms, as well as the role of lakes in the global carbon cycle.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2025	677								113183	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113183		NOV 2025											WOS:001581243900001

We analyzed the grain size, branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), and leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (delta D-wax) of sediments from Lake Tianchi in the ISM region, to reconstruct the temperature and monsoon history for the past 23 kyr. The results reveal a notable negative correlation between the abundance of brGDGT-IIIa and grain size, indicating the non-negligible influence of soil-derived brGDGTs on temperature. Using the grain size-brGDGT-IIIa relationship, we assessed the contribution of soil-derived brGDGTs and corrected the temperature accordingly. The results reveal a similar to 6 degrees C warming from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 23-20 kyr) to the mid-Holocene (similar to 8-6 kyr), punctuated by several millennial-scale events, including Heinrich event 1 (H1; 16.5-15 kyr), the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d (B/A; 15-12.8 kyr), and the Younger Dryas (YD; similar to 12.8-11 kyr), with H1 being the coldest interval. The delta D-wax records show that H1 was the driest interval, with a drier LGM and YD and a wet B/A and early- to mid-Holocene. Furthermore, the delta D-wax records display a pattern of variation similar to the interhemispheric temperature gradient, indicating that the intensity of this gradient is the primary factor controlling the ISM precipitation. Given the significant influence of Antarctic ice on the interhemispheric temperature gradient, the anticipated loss of half of the Antarctic sea ice by 2100 would lead to the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and associated drought in the ISM region.

Previous studies of lake response to El Nino events have focused on a limited number of lakes. Despite advances in remote sensing technology, there have been few comprehensive and largescale studies using deep learning, and there are still gaps in understanding the response mechanisms on a larger scale. This study leverages advanced deep-learning techniques to map lake responses, offering unprecedented insights into the large-scale hydrological impacts of El Nino. Our results show that lakes shrink significantly during El Nino events on the TP. Lakes located in the central and southern parts of the TP and small lakes with areas ranging from 1 to 50 km2 (over 60 % of them) exhibited strong responses. The range of lake response to El Nino events varies with their intensity, with stronger El Nino events causing an expansion of the response range along the latitudinal direction. We propose four possible mechanisms for lake response patterns to El Nino from the perspective of lake water sources. Strong shrinkage is primarily caused by decreased precipitation and increased evaporation, with a possible contribution from reduced meltwater. Strong expansion is due to increased precipitation, more glacier and frozen soil meltwater, and reduced evaporation. For slight shrinkage and expansion patterns, the balance of meltwater may offset or even counteract the El Nino signal. The study's results could improve predictions of extreme weather events like droughts and floods in the Third Pole region, enhance water resource management and responsiveness, and offer valuable insights for ecological monitoring and early warning systems development.

The assessment of the bacterial community structure was done by using the Next Generation Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicon, a bacterial phylogenetic marker. Sultanpur Lake is located in Sultanpur National Park Gurugram, in the state of Haryana, India. This place harbors great plant and animal biodiversity and serves as an important feeding, roosting and breeding ground for both resident and migratory avian fauna. Increasing pollution level and scarcity of water during summer months impose a great threat to the lake. Sediment bacteria are considered as reliable recorders of nutrient cycling and active mediums of biogeochemical processes and thus were assessed in this study. Wet and dry sediment samples were taken and analyzed for their bacterial community structure and diversity. The amplicon sequencing generated 881,118 reads which corresponded to 93 known species in case of dry sediments and 8,71,102 reads corresponding to 44 species in case of wet sediments. In dry sediments the top ten phyla were Firmicutes (26%), Bacteroidetes (14%), Proteobacteria (15%), Cyanobacteria (12%), Parcubacteria (7%), Euryarcheota (6%), Actinobacteria (5%), Armatimonadetes (5%), Chloroflexi (2%) and Planctomycetes (2%). In case of wet sediments, the top ten phyla were Firmicutes (35%), Bacteroidetes (22%), Proteobacteria (22%), Actinobacteria (7%), Chloroflexi (5%) Parcubacteria (3%), Verrucomimicrobia ( 3%) and, Deinococcus-Thermus (3%).There was change in the community structure at species level too with Clostridium species as the most dominant species in case of wet sediments and Lactobacillus species as the predominant one in dry sediments. This study provides an insight into the changes in the bacterial communities due to changes in hydrology and how this change will affect the health of this wetland as irregular water supply is a major stressor of this wetland.

GHEORGHE BRANCH (DANUBE DELTA) AS A RESULT OF THE HYDROTECHNICAL WORKS	4TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE GEOBALCANICA 2018	International Scientific Conference Geobalcanica Proceedings				4th International Scientific Conference on Geobalcanica	MAY 15-16, 2018	Ohrid, MACEDONIA					The hydrotechnical works on Sf. Gheorghe arm in Danube Delta was done by Institute for Research and Planning for Water Management. The work was part of the framework scheme for the Dobrogea hydrographic area and was nominated in the investment plan of the National Water Council. The regularization works, started in 1988, consists in the rectification of the main meanders of the arm in the following sectors: lvancea, Dranov, Dunavat and Murighiol. The total length of the rectification is 15 km and the shortening of the natural course is 32 km. These works impose changes in the balance of the hydrological regime on the main course, along the meanders and on the channels connecting the arm waters and the aquatic complexes within the delta. By altering the fractal dimension of the arm, fluviatile processes are intensified and have irremediable long-term repercussions. This leads to the eutrophication of lakes in the aquatic complexes by low water intake, then clogging of the channels and, also, of the lakes resulting in diminishing / changing the habitats. As clear evidence are these two channels: Ivancea and Erenciuc north (completely clogged). Now, other 4 channels are threatened, which already show very low depths at the confluence with the Sf. Gheorghe arm. This is an exhaustive study of the current situation of the meanders of the Sf. Gheorghe arm from the morphological point of view and the fragile longitudinal and lateral connectivity through morphometric analysis methods using geomatics techniques. The foundation of this study will be based on existing literature, field data, historical and current data, in collaboration with other institutes and universities capable of providing important data such as sediments, hydro-technical works, etc.					; Mierla, Marian/ABB-7696-2020; Mihu-Pintilie, Alin/I-5906-2017	Mierla, Marian/0000-0001-8622-570X; 																			2018							421	431		10.18509/GBP.2018.46	http://dx.doi.org/10.18509/GBP.2018.46													WOS:000467951300046
J	Temimi, M; Leconte, R; Brissette, F; Chaouch, N				Temimi, M; Leconte, R; Brissette, F; Chaouch, N			Flood monitoring over the Mackenzie River Basin using passive microwave data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Flooding over the Mackenzie River Basin, which is situated in northwestern Canada, is a complex and rapid process. This process is mainly controlled by the occurrence of ice jams. Flood forecasting is of very important in mitigating social and economic damage. This study investigates the potential of a rating curve model for flood forecasting. The proposed approach is based on the use of a Water Surface Fraction derived from SSM/I passive microwave images and discharge observations. The rating curve model is based on an existing correlation between flooded areas and measured discharge. However, a time lag can be observed between these two variables. Thus, the rating curve model has been modified by the introduction of a lag term that could vary depending on the flooding intensity and the features of the basin. Hence, the lag term is computed dynamically using a cross-correlation function between Water Surface Fraction values which are derived from SSM/I observations and the discharge vectors. The rating curve model is based on two empirical parameters that depend on the site features, which vary in both space and time. To overcome this dependency, the rating curve model was linked to a Kalman filter in order to dynamically estimate the empirical parameters according to the forecasting errors encountered at each time step. With the Kalman filter, the dynamic rating curve model continuously readjusts its parameters to satisfy the non-stationary behavior of hydrological processes. The model is thus sufficiently flexible and adapted to various conditions. Simulations were carried out over the Mackenzie River Basin (1.8 million km(2)) during the summers of 1998 and 1999. NOAA-AVHRR images were used to validate the forecast WSF values. The predicted flooded areas agree well with those derived from the NOAA-AVHRR images. Further simulations were carried out from 1992 to 2000 using the rating curve model to predict discharge at a downstream location. Even though an interannual variability of the water surface fractions was observed over the PAD area, the modified model was sufficiently flexible to be readjusted and to reproduce satisfactory results. This implies that a combination of passive microwave data and discharge observations presents an interesting potential in flood and discharge prediction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-two lowland small and large lakes sampled using a grab in soft substrate were selected to develop biotic indices. Diversity indices based on species numbers - abundances and indices using species sensitivity values were compared. The lakes selected were all situated in the Alpine Ecoregion below 800 in a.s.l. and had similar chemical composition but different levels of anthropogenic pressure. Lakes with data available in different years were included as separate lakes in the analysis; littoral-sublittoral samples of large lakes were also separated from profundal samples yielding a total of 41 sites for analysis. Seven different biotic indices were compared: (I) Shannon diversity index (H), (2) weighted Shannon diversity index (Hw) including in the calculation a sensitivity value assigned to each species. (3) a benthic quality index based on means of three different environmental variables, measuring trophic status, weighted by species abundances (BQITS), (4) an index based on weighted means using a larger set of environmental variables (BQIENV), (5) a modified BQITS, which included both species numbers and total abundance of individuals (BQIES), (6) an index calculated according to a rarefaction method (ES), (7) an index considering indicator species based on experts judgment (BQIEJ). The indices were compared with a trophic status index (TSI) constructed by joining three environmental variables: O-2% saturation in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, total phosphorous and transparency during full circulation. Comparisons were also made with another environmental stress index (EN!) constructed on a larger number of variables. All the biotic indices had significant correlations with both TSI and ENI. BQIES, WED compliant and well correlated with TSI and EN., was selected to tentatively assign the investigated lakes into 5 quality classes: high (H), good (G), moderate (M), poor (P) and bad (B). The statistical power of the classification was estimated. Assuming tentatively equal intervals for each of the five quality classes, 2 lakes were classified at high status, 7 lakes were classified as good, 13 were classified as moderate, 13 were classified as poor and 4 were classified as bad. Fifteen lakes were classified with a power less than 80%. Some of the lakes resampled in different periods displayed a shift of class in the different years. Future work should focus on extending the database to test the indices in other lake types subjected to different pressures.

J	Andrews, P; Cameron, D				Andrews, Peter; Cameron, David			Rudabanya: Taphonomic analysis of a fossil hominid site from Hungary	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The late Miocene deposits at Rudabanya, Hungary, were laid down in a shallow valley sloping westwards from a range of hills and opening out into the Pannonian Lake. Rise and fall of lake level gave rise to varying conditions, from dry land with soil formation to swamp and lake. The stratigraphic and palaeontological succession has been investigated at one of the sites. Rudabanya 2, where two cycles of deposition and erosion are represented, with soil formation, swamp conditions with lignite formation, and periods of extended high lake level succeeding each other. Both mammal and plant fossils are present at several levels. Taphonomic modifications in the Rudabanya 2 vertebrate faunas include losses of skeletal elements through carnivore selection, fluvial sorting at some levels, and post-depositional destruction by leaching and/or acid soils. The lowest level, the lower lignite, has few fossils. The fossil mammals from the level above, the grey marl, are the least modified but they are mixed with abraded, probably allochthonous, bone fragments and more complete specimens resulting from near-lake deaths. Modifications of bones by carnivores are indicated, but the specimens were too broken post-depositionally for the impact of the carnivores to be assessed. Carnivore action is also indicated for the fauna of the black clay which formed on the surface of the grey marl. The fauna consists of relatively abundant small mammals and the primates Anapithecus hernyaki and Dryopithecus hungaricus, with the latter much less common. The predator accumulating the smaller species was probably a viverrid. The red marl fauna is a transported assemblage from higher up the valley with the fossils extremely fragmentary and abraded and few identifiable specimens, almost all of which are teeth. The black mud fauna is also probably a transported assemblage, lower energy than the red marl environment, and the bones are much modified subsequently by acid corrosion similar to that seen today in bone preserved in peat bogs. Dryopithecus is a major constituent of the fauna, with Anapithecus less common. D. hungaricus is thus associated more strongly with swamp forest and shallow riverine conditions with low energy movement of water, and A. hernyaki is associated with lake shore (probably forest) conditions, accumulating in lake sediments and lake-flat sediments. The palaeoecology of the area as a whole, based on the associated flora and fauna, is a combination of swamp forest, lake shore forest and open mud flats.

Production profiles, expressed as frequency distributions of (+):(-) ipsdienol ratios [= ratio of (S)-(+)-ipsdienol to (R)-(-)-ipsdienol], were bimodal for four western British Columbia populations. The (+):(-) ratios ranged from 63:37 to 71:29, consistent with those previously found for the New York race. The profile for a southeastern population from Radium, British Columbia, was intermediate between those for the four western British Columbia populations and that from one population in Kimberley, British Columbia, just south of Radium. Males in the Kimberley population produce predominantly (R)-(-)-ipsdienol, typical of California and Idaho males. Response profiles of different individuals of I. pini, determined by captures of beetles in multiple-funnel traps baited with ipsdienol of 11 different(+):(-) ratios, were not consistent with production profiles. Populations in Williams Lake and Princeton, in western British Columbia, and Radium, in southeastern British Columbia, had response profiles with maximal attraction to ipsdienol over a broad range of (+):(-) ratios, falling off as enantiomeric purity was approached at either end of the spectrum. This type of response profile is consistent with that for the New York race, which has been shown to respond optimally to (+):(-) ratios ranging from 40:60 to 70:30. The response profile of the Kimberley population gradually declined from maximal attraction to ipsdienol with a (+):(-) ratio of 2:98 to the lowest response at a (+):(-) ratio of 98:2. The attraction of I. pini to chemical stimuli in California is interrupted by ipsdienol with a (+):(-) ratio > 5:95, a pheromone of a host competitor, the California five-spined ips, Ips paraconfusus Lanier. We hypothesize that the Idaho race, which does not compete with I. paraconfusus due to geographical separation, is characterized by a Kimberley-type enantiomeric response profile, intermediate between those of the New York and California races.																			0098-0331					NOV	1996	22	11					2157	2172		10.1007/BF02040100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02040100								24227221					WOS:A1996VW74100013

Cellular responses to thermal stress and moderate oxygen limitation in juvenile lake trout	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is an important food fish in northern communities, inhabiting cool, well-oxygenated water, but climate change is reducing available habitat, with extended summer stratification of lakes creating an upper thermal barrier (similar to 15 degrees C) and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) boundary (4-7 mg L-1). Together, these environmental factors can influence tolerance thresholds and climate change may lead to abiotic factors exceeding these physiological thresholds in lake trout habitats. Thresholds can shift with environmental acclimation in lake trout populations, but the functional basis of this shift has yet to be examined. The abundance of transcripts offers insight into underlying cellular responses to environmental stressors that can provide an early warning of adverse physiological outcomes. Here, we used a stress-response transcriptional profiling chip to investigate a suite of genes involved in thermal and general stress in lake trout acclimated to a range of temperatures (6-18 degrees C) and two DO conditions (similar to 10 or similar to 6 mg L-1), as well as following acute thermal stress (i.e. CTmax). Transcriptional profiles were assessed in the gill, liver and epidermal mucus. Generally, fish acclimated to the greatest combined stressor (i.e. 18 degrees C and 6 mg L-1 DO) had the largest transcriptional response, suggestive of a transition from a routine stress response to an extreme survival response. A noted temperature dependence occurred in liver tissue, which was not evident in gill or mucus tissues. Further, transcriptional responses in the gill and mucus were highly correlated (r = 0.74-0.87), highlighting the potential use of these tissues for non-lethal sampling methods to enhance management and conservation strategies for lake trout.

Samples were collected from June until September 2008. Non-toxic cyanobacterial samples from urban Stefanski Reservoir were used as a negative control for genetic analysis. All the physico-chemical and biological parameters exceeded threshold limits for the process of eutrophication. The total phosphorus (TP) was found to be the decisive parameter for the development of toxigenic cyanobacterial bloom and MCs presence. Toxigenic MCs-producing cyanobacteria dominated by M. aeruginosa were found in almost all analyzed samples in Jeziorsko Reservoir, in opposite to non-toxigenic cyanobacteria in Stefanski Reservoir. The result of semi-quantitative measurements of mcyA gene band indicated the highest toxigenic potential in late summer in Jeziorsko Reservoir. The highest risk related with recreational use of this reservoir was identified in August and September (MCs > 2 mu g/L). A positive correlation between chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial biomass (R=0.73, p<0.05) and total MCs concentration (R=0.78 and 0.84, p<0.05, respectively for the ELISA and HPLC) was observed. Moreover, the variation of results of semi-quantitative measurements of mcyA gene correlated positively with M. aeruginosa (R=0.76, p<0.05), also with the total cyanobacterial biomass (R=0.81, p<0.05), MCs concentration (R=0.95 and 0.85, p<0.05, for the ELISA and HPLC respectively) and chlorophyll a (R=0.79, P<0.05). The analysis of chlorophyll a concentration and densitometrical semi-quantification of mcyA gene were recommended for application in the early warning system against cyanobacteria and MCs-producing cyanobacteria dominated by M. aeruginosa in Jeziorsko Reservoir.

John B.; Huser, Brian; Veski, Siim			Chironomid-climate continentality conundrum	PLOS ONE												It is predicted that continentality, a climate parameter representative of a region's annual temperature and precipitation range, will undergo significant changes in the future. The lack of past continentality reconstructions makes it impossible to decipher any long-term patterns of continentality changes. Here, we investigate the extent to which continentality influences modern chironomid assemblages and evaluate their ecological relevance for palaeolimnological data-based reconstructions of past continentality. We selected 53 lakes along a longitudinal gradient covering the East European Plain (Western part of Russia, Estonia, Latvia) and southern Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway). We analysed the dependency of chironomid assemblages on a variety of environmental parameters including two continentality indices (annual temperature range (ATR) and the Kerner Oceanity Index (KOI)), growing degree days at base temperature 5 degrees C, mean air temperatures of July, April, and October, number of ice-cover days, lake-water pH, loss-of-ignition and water depth using redundancy analysis. Correlations between all variables were tested to check for possible confounding effects. KOI had the highest explanatory power of 18.4% in the dataset and an absence of collinearity (correlation index < 0.7) with all the other tested variables. Further, we estimated weighted average optima to investigate the distribution of the morphotypes along the continentality gradient in the dataset. Glyptotendipes pallens-type, Neozavrelia, Polypedilum sordens-type, and Microchironomus showed a preference for a continental climate, while Paratanytarsus penicillatus-type, Pseudorthocladius, Thienemannimyia, and Limnophyes were found mainly in samples from oceanic areas. Weighted averaging-partial least squares regression was used for a trial test of the data, resulting in a promising KOI-based model performance with R2 = 0.73 and RMSEP = 5.1. Despite the relatively small dataset, our study suggests that chironomid data have the potential for further development as a tool for reconstructing palaeocontinentality.

To elucidate the impact of Chagan Nur Lake on an extreme precipitation process in the marginal region of the East Asian monsoon during summer and to contribute to the knowledge concerning extreme weather variability in mid-latitude semi-arid regions, this study focused on the extreme precipitation event that transpired between 24 and 27 July 2021 within the Chagan Nur Lake basin using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The experiment involved modifying the subsurface characteristics of Chagan Nur Lake to simulate scenarios with and without the lake. The results indicated that the large-scale circulation triggered intense convective processes in the Chagan Nur Lake area, while the lake itself affected the local climate and regional precipitation patterns. Overall, Chagan Nur Lake exerted a negative influence on the precipitation process, leading to a reduction of 20-30 mm in the total precipitation. In the six hours preceding the precipitation, Chagan Nur Lake caused an average decrease of 0.2-0.4 degrees C in both the 2 m temperature (T2) and dew point temperature (TD), as well as a decrease of 0-10 m in the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). The "cold" effect of Chagan Nur Lake inhibited atmospheric convective processes, thereby reducing the development of vertical motion. Subsequent to the terrestrialization of the lake, stronger thermal and dynamical conditions led to an increase in precipitation in the region. This study highlights the pivotal role of lakes in the occurrence of extreme precipitation in watersheds. It will be of paramount importance to consider the impact of the lake climate when forecasting precipitation in the semi-arid lake regions.

This study investigates the concentrations of five toxic heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Zn, Cu, and Cr) and their potential health implications in two economically important fish species (Otolithoides pama and Labeo bata) from a subtropical estuarine wetland system (Feni estuary, Bangladesh). Muscle and gill samples from 36 individual fish were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). The results revealed that the average quantities of heavy metals in both fishes' muscle followed the declining order of Zn (109.41-119.93 mg/kg) > Cu (45.52-65.43 mg/kg) > Hg (1.25-1.39 mg/kg) > Pb (0.68-1.12 mg/kg) > Cr (0.31-5.82 mg/kg). Furthermore, Zn was found to be present in the highest concentration within the gills of both species. While the levels of Cu, Zn, and Cr in the fish muscle were deemed acceptable for human consumption, the concentrations of Pb and Hg exceeded the permissible limits (>0.5 mg/kg) for human consumption. Different risk indices, including estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), and carcinogenic or target risk (TR), revealed mixed and varying degrees of potential threat to human health. According to the EDI values, individuals consuming these fish may face health risks as the levels of Zn, Cu, and Cr in the muscle are either very close to or exceed the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI) threshold. Nevertheless, the THQ and HI values suggested that both species remained suitable for human consumption, as indicated by THQ (<1) and HI (<1) values. Carcinogenic risk values for Pb, Cr, and Zn all remained within permissible limits, with TR values falling below the range of (10(-6) to 10(-4)), except for Zn, which exceeded it (>10(-4)). The correlation matrix and multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) findings revealed that Pb and Cr primarily stemmed from natural geological backgrounds, whereas Zn, Cu, and Hg were attributed to human-induced sources such as agricultural chemicals, silver nanoparticles, antimicrobial substances, and metallic plating. Given the significance of fish as a crucial and nutritious element of a balanced diet, it is essential to maintain consistent monitoring and regulation of the levels and origins of heavy metals found within it.

Peaks of Cs-137 and apparent density gave estimated sedimentation rates of around 1 and 2 kg m(-2) y(-1) in Lakes Kasumigaura and Suwa, respectively. Slight decreases of TP and TN contents (0.07 and 0.63 mg g(-1) for TP and TN, respectively, in Lake Kasumigaura and 0.90 mg g(-1) for TN in Lake Suwa) were observed by comparison between the cores obtained around 1980 and those of recent years except for a considerable decrease in TP in Lake Suwa (1.0 mg g(-1)). This decrease probably came from the higher percentage of easily releasable phosphorus in the past sediments of Lake Suwa. Using the TP and TN increases in lake waters during summer, the averaged nutrient release rates were estimated to be within the ranges of those observed by laboratory core experiments and by measuring the vertical profiles of interstitial concentrations except for a smaller estimation of TN in Lake Kasumigaura. On the other hand, the nutrient release rates were also determined using the long-term changes in sediment nutrient contents. The estimated rates were a little lower than the rates determined by the method using the increase in lake nutrient concentrations other than the higher ones for TP in Lake Suwa, which were originally based on the higher percentage of easily releasable phosphorus as mentioned above. Net sedimentation rates for 24 years in Lake Kasumigaura and those for 26 years in Lake Suwa calculated as the sum of new sedimentation and changes in old sediments during these periods were compared with the net input loads based on the per capita/exporting method. In the case of TP, we observed a fairly good agreement because of its conservation, whereas the residuals were larger for TN due to denitrification in the overlying waters of sediments. The rates estimated from the imbalances in TN were in the ranges of the measured denitrification rates in laboratory tests with the sediments. Thus, the information on the long-term changes in sediment nutrients could provide the average rates of these fundamental processes in lake environments.					; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019; Onda, Yuichi/N-6527-2014	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; Onda, Yuichi/0000-0001-8753-0378													1863-9135					NOV	2010	177	3					177	188		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0177													WOS:000284218100002

Meanwhile, climate warming also causes atmospheric stilling, a phenomenon of the significant decrease of surface wind speed, which reduces the water column mixing and exacerbates hypoxia in lake bottom water. However, the relative importance and compound impacts of heatwaves and atmospheric stilling on lake deoxygenation and hypoxia remain poorly understood, inhibiting our deep understanding of aquatic ecosystem response to global climate change. Here we use the long-term meteorological and hydrological observations, combined with high-frequency dissolved oxygen profile measurements to explore compound processes and their impact on deoxygenation in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake. Our findings reveal a rapid increase in the frequency and duration of lake heatwaves and atmospheric stilling extremes in Lake Taihu from 1980 to 2023, with more frequent and prolonged compound heatwaves and stilling extremes (CHSEs). The linear increasing rates of heatwaves, stilling extremes and CHSEs duration are 14.8, 6.6, and 1.9 day/decade, respectively. Quadratic models outperform the linear fitting for heatwaves and CHSEs demonstrating accelerating trends. Hypoxia (DO <= 2.0 mg/L at 7:00 a.m.) occurred 14.1 % vs 11.8 %, 21.6 % vs 12.3 %, and 30.4 % vs 11.9 % of the time in bottom waters during heatwave vs non-heatwave periods, stilling extremes vs no-stilling periods, and CHSEs vs non-CHSEs, respectively, in the summer half year (May-October). Our results highlight that atmospheric stilling extremes drive stronger deoxygenation and hypoxia than heatwaves, while CHSEs exacerbate this trend in large shallow lake.

Through extensive field investigations, a complete Holocene sedimentary profile has been discovered in the Zoige Basin of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The history of Holocene wildfire activities and climate change in this region was reconstructed using various paleoclimate proxies, including charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, and total organic carbon. This study also elucidated the relationship between Holocene paleoenvironmental conditions and wildfire activities. The results indicated that during the Holocene, the wildfire activities in the Zoige Basin were primarily regional, with local fires mainly involving woody plants and regional fires dominated by herbaceous plant burning. In the early Holocene, before 8.5 ka, despite a temperature increase, the climate in the Zoige Basin remained dry and cold. During this period, an aeolian sand layer was deposited, and the limited plant biomass restricted wildfire occurrence, resulting in the low frequencies of both local and regional fires. During the middle Holocene (8.5-3.1 ka), the warm and moist climate driven by the East Asian summer monsoon led to the development of a paleosol layer in the Zoige Basin. The increased temperature and precipitation enhanced the plant biomass, and frequent regional and local wildfire activities were observed. In the Late-Holocene, after 3.1 ka, as the climate cooled and dried, a modern soil layer formed and wildfire activities decreased. The reduction in plant biomass likely contributed to the decline in regional wildfires, whereas the intensification of local fires may have been influenced by human activities. The results enhanced our understanding of wildfire history and climate evolution in the Zoige Basin.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2025	35	9					854	864		10.1177/09596836251340835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836251340835		JUN 2025											WOS:001508111600001

Given the in-lake P concentration and the Connell hypothesis (1978) on species richness control, we asume that species richness is medium. Lake food webs were analyzed based upon morphological species and on ecological traits, resulting in lowering << species >> richness, trophic links and links per << species >> but increasing connectance when traits were used. Connectance diminishes if all lake environments (planktic and benthic) are included in the analysis as compared with values when only the pelagial environment is analyzed. Lacustrine producton is dominated by benthic processes, in which the role of stoneworts and submerged and emergent phanerogams are very important. At least in summer, when our data were available, the lake is truly autotrophic. Monthly CO2 outgassing to the atmosphere is high, but a large fraction comes from hydrological or calcifying processes. The short retention time of lake waters results in high export of nutrients downstream; however, bicarbonate flux, which might be related with calcium and magnesium fluxes in this karstic environment, cannot be explained easily. Joint analysis of all these features enable us to place Laguna de Somolinos an overall category which we envisage for small lakes worldwide, having short water retention time and low DOC and P contents. In order to better understand all these lacustrine processes, the entire Somolinos watershed need to be included in the study, including the groundwater environment, since it is possible that many of the uncertainties that emerge in this book can be explained by expanding the study scale of the environmental processes. But this depends on the knowledge of our natural resources will receive adequate financing in the future, unusual in Spain during the 2010 decade.																					978-84-00-10443-6; 978-84-00-10442-9				2018	46						251	292																WOS:000637015500013
J	Klaminder, J; Bindler, R; Emteryd, O; Renberg, I				Klaminder, J; Bindler, R; Emteryd, O; Renberg, I			Uptake and recycling of lead by boreal forest plants: Quantitative estimates from a site in northern Sweden	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												As a consequence of deposition of atmospheric pollution, the lead concentration in the mor layer (the organic horizon) of remote boreal forest soils in Sweden is raised far above natural levels. How the mor will respond to decreased atmospheric pollution is not well known and is dependent on future deposition rates, downward migration losses and upward fluxes in the soil profile. Plants may contribute to the upward flux of lead by 'pumping' lead back to the mor surface through root uptake and subsequent litter fall. We use lead concentration and stable isotope (Pb-206, Pb-207 and Pb-208) measurements of forest vegetation to quantify plant uptake rates from the soil and direct from the atmosphere at two sites in northern Sweden; an undisturbed mature forest and a disturbed site with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) growing on a recently exposed mineral soil (C-horizon) containing a minimum of atmospherically derived pollution lead. Analyses of forest mosses from a herbarium collection (spanning the last similar to 100 yr) and soil matrix samples suggest that the atmospheric lead deposited on plants and soil has an average Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of 1.15, while lead derived from local soil minerals has an average ratio of similar to 1.47. Since the biomass of trees and field layer shrubs has an average Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio of similar to 1.25, this indicates that 70% +/- 10% of the inventory of 1 +/- 0.8 mg Pb m(-2) stored in plants in the mature forest originates from pollution. Needles, bark and apical stemwood of the pine growing on the disturbed soil, show lower Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios (as low as 1.21) than the roots and basal stemwood (having ratios > 1.36), which indicate that plants are able to incorporate lead directly from the atmosphere (similar to 50% of the total tree uptake). By partitioning the total uptake of lead into uptake from the atmosphere and different soil layers using an isotopic mixing model, we estimate that similar to 0.03 +/- 0.01, 0.02 +/- 0.01 and 0.05 +/- 0.01 mg Pb m(-2) yr(-1) (mean +/- SD), is taken up from the mor layer, the mineral soil and the atmosphere, respectively, by plants in the undisturbed mature forest. These small fluxes, which are at least a magnitude lower than reported downward migration losses, suggest that plant uptake will not strongly prolong the self-cleaning rate of the mor layer.

Foraging and predation risk for larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Lake Superior: A modelling synthesis of empirical survey data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The relative importance of predation and food availability as contributors to larval cisco (Coregonus artedi) mortality in Lake Superior were investigated using a visual foraging model to evaluate potential predation pressure by rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and a bioenergetic model to evaluate potential starvation risk. The models were informed by observations of rainbow smelt, larval cisco, and zooplankton abundance at three Lake Superior locations during the period of spring larval cisco emergence and surface-oriented foraging. Predation risk was highest at Black Bay, ON, where average rainbow smelt densities in the uppermost 10 m of the water column were >1000 ha(-1). Turbid conditions at the Twin Ports, WI-MN, affected larval cisco predation risk because rainbow smelt remained suspended in the upper water column during daylight, placing them alongside larval cisco during both day and night hours. Predation risk was low at Cornucopia, WI, owing to low smelt densities (<400 ha(-1)) and deep light penetration, which kept rainbow smelt near the lakebed and far from larvae during daylight. In situ zooplankton density estimates were low compared to the values used to develop the larval coregonid bioenergetics model, leading to predictions of negative growth rates for 10 mm larvae at all three locations. The model predicted that 15 mm larvae were capable of attaining positive growth at Cornucopia and the Twin Ports where low water temperatures (2-6 degrees C) decreased their metabolic costs. Larval prey resources were highest at Black Bay but warmer water temperatures there offset the benefit of increased prey availability. A sensitivity analysis performed on the rainbow smelt visual foraging model showed that it was relatively insensitive, while the coregonid bioenergetics model showed that the absolute growth rate predictions were highly sensitive to input parameters (i.e., 20% parameter perturbation led to order of magnitude differences in model estimates). Our modelling indicated that rainbow smelt predation may limit larval cisco survival at Black Bay and to a lesser extent at Twin Ports, and that starvation may be a major source of mortality at all three locations. The framework we describe has the potential to further our understanding of the relative importance of starvation and predation on larval fish survivorship, provided information on prey resources available to larvae are measured at sufficiently fine spatial scales and the models provide a realistic depiction of the dynamic processes that the larvae experience.

Neon is in approximate atmospheric equilibrium throughout the lake, but the concentrations of both helium isotopes increase with depth and reach values of up to 10 (He-4) and 50 (He-3) times the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The isotopic ratio of the helium excess, R(ex) = He-3(ex)/He-4(ex), is (7.42 +/- 0.03) . 10(-6), i.e., R(ex)/R(a) = 5.36 +/- 0.02, where R(a) = 1.384 . 10(-6) is the isotopic ratio in air. This indicates the presence of mantle-derived helium. Laacher See is thermally stratified during the summer. It acts as an almost perfect trap for injected gases. The helium concentration in the hypolimnion (deep water) approximately doubled from May to September 1991 yielding a mean He-4-flux of (10 +/- 2) . 10(12) atoms m(-2) s(-1). This value is 30 times smaller than in Lake Nyos, Cameroon, but 20 times larger than in Crater Lake, USA. Release of bubbles of nearly pure CO2 (>99%) observable in shallow waters at the eastern shore, as well as detected by divers in about 30 m depth, was identified as an important source of the helium excess in the lake. If carefully sampled by divers to avoid air contamination, the bubbles exhibit mantle influenced isotopic signatures not only for helium, but also for neon and argon (Ne-20/Ne-22 = 9.92 +/- 0.03; Ar-40/Ar-36 = 391 +/- 4). Based on the elemental ratios of carbon, neon, and argon to He-3, the fluxes of volatiles from the mantle into Laacher See are determined as 7.4 . 10(7) atoms m(-2) s(-1) for He-3, 13 . 10(7) atoms m(-2) s(-1) for Ne-20, 26 . 10(7) atoms m(-2) s(-1) for Ar-36, and 6.4 . 10(17) molecules m(-2) s(-1) for CO2. Non-atmospheric neon was also found in the well ''Wallenborn'' in the West EifeI volcanic field with a Ne-20/Ne-22-ratio as high as 11.21 +/- 0.06.					; Aeschbach, Werner/C-1026-2008; Wieler, Rainer/A-1355-2010	Wieler, Rainer/0000-0001-5666-7494; Aeschbach, Werner/0000-0003-0917-1239; 													0016-7037	1872-9533				JAN	1996	60	1					31	41		10.1016/0016-7037(95)00370-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(95)00370-3													WOS:A1996TQ46100004

Environmental monitoring of water reservoirs of Kumo-Manych depression	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The reservoirs of the Kumo-Manych depression are of relict origin and function due to leaching of the sea sediments composing the depression by surface and ground waters. The article presents the results of long-term environmental monitoring of reservoirs of Manych group of lakes with high mineralization, which contributes to the formation of a specific biocenosis. The study of ecological features of water bodies under the conditions of limiting influence of salinity showed that a high degree of water salinity (80-200 g/L) contributes to the active development and reproduction of Artemia salina L. in lakes Bol'shoe Yashaltinskoe and Jama. The main source of nutrition of the parthenogenetic population of Artemia are microphytes Dunaliella salina, Nitzschia, Navicula, Surirella, which have high plasticity and are able to withstand sudden changes in water mineralization. 24 species of diatoms and 1 species of green algae were found. The analysis of the results showed that the composition, dynamics of abundance and genesis of biota are subject to fluctuations, depending on the cumulative effect of environmental factors. The strongest degree of mineralization of surface waters in the lakes of Manych group is formed during the summer period at the value of hydrothermal factor of 0.3-0.4. In the lakes, it is noted the development of two or three generations of crustaceans Artemia salina, the average number of different age crustaceans for the period April-August in the lake Bol'shoe Yashaltinskoe is 23.07-61.14 thousand ind./m(3), in the lake Jama - 10.05-23.15 thousand ind./m(3). The dependence between the mineralization of water (x) and the average body length of crustaceans (Y) is approximated by the equation of the form: Y = 8,9118 + 0,0041 x (n = 60; r = 0.38;. = 0.03; r(2) = 0.14).

The site and surrounding area have been significantly contaminated by direct discharges of radionuclides for over 40 years, the Techa River alone having received more than 100 PBq of waste in the period 1949-1956. The aim of this study was to consider the levels of Sr-90 and Cs-137 in water, sediment and biota samples for two industrial reservoirs in the Mayak PA area, thus allowing a biogeochemical assessment of the behaviour of radionuclides in the system. Four sediment cores were collected and sectioned along with four water samples and seven fish samples (pike, perch and roach). Samples were analysed using (i) standard gamma-spectrometric techniques (HPGe and NaI(TI) detectors) for Cs-137 determination; and (ii) radiochemical separation and beta-counting (low-background, anti-coincidence and Geiger-Muller counters) for Sr-90 determination. Maximum specific activities (dry weight) of 3350 kBq kg(-1) Cs-137 and 720 kBq kg(-1) Sr-90 were measured in sediments from Reservoir 10. Activity levels of sediment-bound radionuclides in Reservoir 11 were 403 kBq kg(-1) Cs-137 and 670 kBq kg(-1) Sr-90. Water concentrations in Reservoir 10 were as high as 100 Bq 1(-1) Cs-137 and 8.4-14 kBq 1(-1) Sr-90. A dramatic decrease in Cs-137 concentrations was observed in Reservoir 11, i.e. 1.1-1.5 Bq 1(-1), but Sr-90 levels fell to a lesser extent, i.e. 1.9-2.4 kBq 1(-1). Sediment and water activity data allowed the calculation of distribution coefficients (K-d values). This parameter fluctuated for both radionuclides reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the sediment deposits in the reservoirs. Caesium-137 Concentration Factors (CFs) as high as 1400 1 kg(-1) were calculated for pike from Reservoir 10. A pronounced 'trophic level' effect was evident in Reservoir 11 (pike CF = 1000, roach CF = 240). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Yang, B; Sheng, JY; Hatcher, BG; Petrie, B				Yang, Bo; Sheng, Jinyu; Hatcher, Bruce G.; Petrie, Brian			Numerical study of circulation and temperature-salinity distributions in the Bras d'Or Lakes	OCEAN DYNAMICS					25th Anniversary Joint-Numerical-Sea-Modelling-Group Meeting (JONSMOD)	JUN 26-28, 2006	Univ Plymouth, Plymouth, ENGLAND	Joint Numer Sea Modelling Grp	Univ Plymouth			The Bras d'Or Lakes (BdOL) are a large, complex and virtually land-locked estuary in central Cape Breton Island of Nova Scotia and one of Canada's charismatic ecosystems, sustaining ecological and cultural communities unique in many aspects. The BdOL comprise two major basins, many deep and shallow bays, several narrow channels and straits and a large, geologically complex watershed. Predictive knowledge of the water movement within the estuary is a key requirement for effective management and sustainable development of the BdOL ecosystem. A three-dimensional (3D) primitive-equation ocean circulation model is used to examine the estuary's response to tides, winds and buoyancy forcing associated with freshwater runoff in a series of numerical experiments validated with empirical data. The model results generate intense, jet-like tidal flows of about 1 m s(-1) in the channels between the basins and connecting them to the ocean and relatively weak tidal currents in other regions, which agrees well with previous observations and numerical results. Wind forcing and buoyancy forcing associated with river runoff play important roles in generating the significant sub-tidal circulations in the estuary, including narrow channels, deep basins and shallow bays. The circulation model is also used to reconstruct the 3D circulation and temperature-salinity distributions in the summer months of 1974, when current and hydrographic measurements were made at several locations. The sub-tidal circulation in the estuary produced by the model is characterised by wind and barometric set-up and set-down in different sections of the system, and a classic two-layer estuarine circulation in which brackish, near-surface waters flow seaward from the estuary into the Atlantic Ocean, and deep salty waters flow landward through the major channel. The model results reproduce reasonably well the overall features of observed circulation and temperature-salinity fields made in the BdOL in 1974 but generally underestimate the observed currents and density stratification. The model discrepancies reflect the use of spatially mean wind forcing and spatially and monthly mean surface heat flux and the inability of the coarse model horizontal resolution (similar to 500 m) to resolve narrow channels and straits.																			1616-7341	1616-7228				OCT	2007	57	4-5					245	268		10.1007/s10236-007-0120-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-007-0120-7													WOS:000250486100003

At Lake Nero in the Rostov-Jaroslavl' area, which is outside the maximum limit of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, sedimentation recommenced shortly after 15 cal ka BP in response to increases in temperature and humidity during Greenland Interstadial 1 (GI-1; Bolling-Allerod). However, climatic amelioration during GI-1 was slow to increase lake organic productivity or trigger large-scale changes in much of northwestern Russia. In general, this region was characterised bv long-lasting lake-ice cover, low lake productivity, soil erosion, and dwarf shrub and herb tundra until the end of Greenland Stadial 1 (GS-1: Younger Dryas). At some sites, distinct increases in lake organic productivity, mean Summer temperatures and humidity and the expansion of forest trees coincide with rapid warming at the beginning of the Holocene and the increasing influence of warm air masses from the North Atlantic. At other sites, particularly on the Karelian Isthmus, but also in Russian Karelia, the delayed response of limnic and terrestrial environments to early Holocene warming is likely related to the cold surface waters of the Baltic Ice Lake, the proximity of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and associated strengthened easterlies, and/or extensive permafrost and stagnant ice. These multi-proxy studies underscore the importance of local conditions in modifying the response of individual lakes and their catchments. While Lateglacial vegetation was dominated by Betula nana and Salix shrubs and various herbs, pollen and plant macrofossils suggest that Betula pubescens trees became established as early as 14-13 cal ka BP in the Rostov-Jaroslavl' area. In general, our data sets suggest that trees migrated from the southeast to the west and then spread later to the northeast and northwest, paralleling the direction of ice retreat, with Betula pubescens immigrating first, followed by Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies. However, palaeoecological records from Lake Terebenskoye in the Valdai Highlands suggest that the arrival of Picea abies preceded other trees in that area and that it colonised tundra communities as early as 12 cal ka BP. Since Lateglacial vegetation change in north-western Russia was time-transgressive, independent measures of palaeoclimate (e.g., chironomid-based palaeotemperature estimates) are needed for this region.

J	Du, DD; Mughal, MS; Zhang, CJ				Du Ding-ding; Mughal, Muhammed Saleem; Zhang Cheng-jun			Petrography, geochemistry and provenance of the sediments of the Early Cretaceous Yanguoxia Formation, Lanzhou-Minhe Basin, Northwest China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Lanzhou-Minhe Basin is situated on the middle Qilian orogenic belt. Yanguoxia Formation contains abundance of maroon siltstones, mudstones and red sandstones of the lake facies. These sedimentary rocks recorded the process of the tectonic uplift of Qilian Mountains during the Early Cretaceous. We discovered plentiful dinosaur footprints, worm burrows, bird footprints, worm tracks-trails, ripple marks and cross lamination in the Yanguoxia site. Integrated petrographic studies classified sandstones of Yanguoxia Formation as feldspathic litharenite. All plots in the QFL (Q or Qt, total quartz; F, feldspar; L, lithic grains) and QmFLt (Qm, monocrystalline quartz; Lt, lithic grains plus polycrystalline quartz) diagrams fall in the recycled orogen provenance field and quartzose recycled field, respectively, implying the source occurred the tectonic activity. Furthermore, geochemical study indicates that the Yanguoxia standstone was formed in an unstable continental setting due to the northwards movement of Indian Plate triggered the collision between the Qilian fold belt and the Qinling fold belt. These sediments were derived from a mixed source and then deposited in the Lanzhou-Minhe Basin. Most of the felsic components were derived from the granitoid rocks of the Qilian Mountains due to the rapid and intense uplift during the Early Cretaceous while the mafic components were contributed by the basic and ultrabasic rocks of the rapidly rising ophiolite in the Qilian Mountain area. Bivariant log-log plot of Qp/(F+L) (Qp, polycrystalline quartz) against Q/(F+L) shows that Yanguoxia Formation was deposited in the semi-humid and semi-arid. Moreover, the pollen also exhibits that the environmental condition during the deposition of Yanguoxia Formation was warm and wet, which affirm such environment was benefit to dinosaur survival. Geochemical study also infers that the Yanguoxia Formation was deposited under the oxidizing condition in a shallow marine environment. The minerals identified from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of shale and siltstone samples are 4.74%-33.53% clays, 23.45%-4l.70% carbonates and 33.99%-71.81% quartz, respectively, which infer that depositional conditions remained uniform during the formation of shales or siltstones of Yanguoxia Formation.

The Devil and the Deep Blue Lake: How Natural Area Acquisition and Stewardship Helps Protect the Major Drinking Reservoir in Northwestern Arkansas	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission (ANHC)'s 1225-ha Devil's Eyebrow Natural Area (DENA), located at the northern end of Beaver Lake along Indian Creek, Butler Creek, and their tributaries, is an ecologically significant site in the Ozark Highlands that falls primarily within the Beaver Lake Watershed, deemed the number-one priority watershed by Arkansas's Unified Watershed Assessments and Restoration Priorities Report due to its designation as an extraordinary water resource, the presence of imperiled aquatic species in the watershed, its role as one of the most important supplies of drinking water in the state, and its status as both an impaired water body and an interstate "water of concern." Beaver Lake supplies drinking water to more than 420,000 people. one in eight Arkansans, and industries including the Walmart Home Office in northwest Arkansas. DENA protects 5 km of Beaver Lake frontage and 7.5 km of critical tributaries in the watershed and is part of a broader interconnected Conservation Corridor that includes Nature Conservancy preserves, Army Corps of Engineers property surrounding Beaver Lake, Hobbs State Park Conservation Area in Arkansas, and the Mark Twain National Forest and Roaring River State Park in Missouri. Water quality protection and improvement has been a critical component driving the funding of DENA, as well as both a direct and indirect focus of much of ANHC's ongoing restoration efforts on the property. Road improvements to decrease sedimentation, reforestation efforts, and feral swine removal have all served to improve water quality in the watershed. A project to improve glade habitat for several species of greatest conservation need through cedar removal has had the added benefit of providing aquatic habitat structure for fish and improving angling opportunities in Beaver Lake. This project serves as a model for conservation partnerships in critical watersheds and also highlights how efforts to directly improve water quality. as well as efforts with indirect benefits to watersheds (conceived primarily to restore terrestrial habitats), can have far-ranging benefits for ecosystems, imperiled species, and stakeholders. Here we present how the ANHC and its conservation partners have successfully used various strategies to build local support, leverage funding. engage the public. and conduct meaningful conservation at a regional scale.

Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Plant Pigments in Bottom Sediments of the Volga River Reservoirs	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												New data on the contents of plant pigments in bottom sediments (BSs) of the Volga River reservoirs in the summer of 2015-2021 are presented. It has been shown that the production properties of benthal do not differ significantly from those at the end of the 20th century. The concentrations of Chl a and its degradation products, pheopigments, in the upper 5-cm layer of sediments decrease from the Upper Volga to the Lower Volga and its unregulated part, with the exception being the Cheboksary Reservoir, which has high values of pigment indicators. The spatial dynamics of sedimentary pigments largely depends on the morphometry of reservoirs and hydrodynamic activity affecting the distribution of BSs. The concentrations of sedimentary pigments are positively related to the content of organic matter (OM), water content, and the total contribution of aleuritic and pelitic fractions and negatively related to the water current velocity, the mean diameter of particles, and volumetric mass of BSs. It has been shown that the relationship between pigment content and depth in the reservoirs of the lower part of the cascade is weakened. No temporal trends in the content of sedimentary pigments in reservoirs were identified during the study period. The average concentrations of sedimentary pigments in 2015-2021 characterize benthal in the Ivankovo Reservoir as hypertrophic; in the Uglich, Rybinsk, Gorky, and Cheboksary reservoirs as eutrophic; in the Kuybyshev, Saratov, and Volgograd reservoirs as mesotrophic; and in the unregulated Volga as oligotrophic. The content of Chl a (with pheopigments) in BSs in terms of the conditional biomass of algae amounts to an insignificant part (0.24-0.86%) of the primary production of phytoplankton, the main producer of OM in the Volga River reservoirs.

J	DUMONT, P; MONGEAU, JR				DUMONT, P; MONGEAU, JR			AN EVALUATION OF THE INTRODUCTORY TRIALS OF THE BROWN TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA) IN THE WATERS OF THE MONTREAL LOWLANDS, QUEBEC	BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE												Introduced into North America in 1883, brown trout (Salmo trutta) was planted for the first time in Quebec in 1890. However, it is only at the beginning of the 1950s that this species began to arise interest among Quebec wildlife managers, biologists and fishermen on account, comparatively to native charrs (Salvelinus spp), of its greater tolerance for rather high temperatures and interspecific competition. In 1965, the discovery of this species in the lowlands of the Montreal area, considered of poor interest for salmonids, has been the starting-point of a sustained planting program in the Saint-Laurent river and in the lower reaches of a certain number of its tributaries. In spite of the relatively high summer temperatures (max. > 25-degrees-C) and the abundant and diversified fish fauna in these waters, the brown trout thrives successfully and grows rapidly. Its sport fishing yield is satisfactory as to fishing success, size of specimen caught and amount of fish planted returned. Spawning has been observed on many occasions. However, the analysis of recent statistics derived from the catch of a group of devoted fishermen supports the hypothesis of a significant contribution of the plantings to the fishing harvest and, on the other hand, the possibility of an insignificant contribution by natural reproduction. The planting possibilities of the brown trout are limited by measures aiming to protect the integrity of aquatic communities north of the 46-degrees N. However, on account of the fact that this species, like many other non native salmonids, is already present in many basins like the Great Lakes, the Saint-Laurent river and several watercourses of many provinces and states of the Atlantic Cost, it seems likely that it will eventually establish itself in the Saint-Laurent estuary and Gulf tributaries, where it might interfere with the anadromous and fresh water populations of atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) and arctic charr (Salvelinus salvelinus).																			0767-2861						1990		319					153	166		10.1051/kmae:1990001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1990001													WOS:A1990FP30500001

Glaciers are important freshwater resources and cause disasters such as glacier collapse and landslides. Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor the movement characteristics of large active glaciers and analyze the process of mass migration, which may cause serious threats and damage to roads and people living in surrounding areas. In this study, we chose a glacier with strong activity in Lulang County, Tibet, as the study area. The complete 4-year time series deformation of the glacier was estimated by using an improved small-baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets. Then, the three-dimensional time series deformation field of the glacier was obtained by using the 3D decomposition technique. Furthermore, the three-dimensional movement of the glacier and its material migration process were analyzed. The results showed that the velocities of the Lulang glacier in horizontal and vertical directions were up to 8.0 m/year and 0.45 m/year, and these were basically consistent with the movement rate calculated from the historical optical images. Debris on both sides of the slope accumulated in the channel after slipping, and the material loss of the three provenances reached 6-9 x 103 m3/year, while the volume of the glacier also decreased by about 76 x 103 m3/year due to snow melting and evaporation. The correlation between the precipitation, temperature, and surface velocity suggests that glacier velocity has a clear association with them, and the activity of glaciers is linked to climate change. Therefore, in the context of global warming, the glacier movement speed will gradually increase with the annual increase in temperature, resulting in debris flow disasters in the future summer high-temperature period.					yao, jiaming/ONK-1143-2025; Yao, Jiayi/IXN-4828-2023	Wang, Xinyao/0009-0008-4740-5706; Cao, Yanbo/0000-0002-9713-4341														2073-445X				AUG	2024	13	8							1126	10.3390/land13081126	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13081126													WOS:001305807900001
J	Genkai-Kato, M				Genkai-Kato, Motomi			Linking population dynamics models with empirically derived models through phytoplankton primary production	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												There are alternative methods for estimation of phytoplankton primary production (PP) that are fundamentally different in the calculation approach. The process-oriented PP model is a mechanistic, empirically derived method based on the photosynthesis-light relationships. The population dynamics-based PP calculation, which is a synthetic method, provides a production estimate based on population dynamics of phytoplankton. These alternative methods were here compared with regard to production estimates and linked to enhance the performance of the existing models of population dynamics applied to a wide variety of lakes worldwide in terms of morphometry, nutrient status, and light environments. Estimates of PP were shown to be sensitive to changes in phytoplankton sinking and zooplankton grazing rates in both methods. Production estimates in the process-oriented PP model were also sensitive to light-associated parameters such as day length. Although the production estimated from the population dynamics-based PP calculation tended to be lower than that from the process-oriented PP model irrespective of lake morphometry, production estimates calculated from both methods with standard parameterization were comparable when production was estimated on an annual timescale. However, it was also shown that the alternative methods could produce different production estimates when estimated on shorter timescales such as cyanobacterial blooms in summer. Cyanobacteria with low mortality due to grazing and sinking losses have been considered as trophic bottlenecks, but there is increasing evidence that their mortality is, to a considerable extent, due to parasitic pathogens. In the case of cyanobacterial blooms, an addition of parasite-related loss term (19%-33% of standing stock) resulted in a resolution of the difference in production estimates between the methods. These analyses theoretically support the critical role of parasitism and resolve the bottleneck problem in aquatic ecosystem metabolism.

Crossing boundaries: Introduced trout alter the bird community in a naturally fishless headwaters ecosystem	ECOSPHERE												Alpine areas such as the headwaters of California's Sierra Nevada are increasingly imperiled by climate change and other human-induced stressors. For one, the introduction of non-native fishes into over 60% of its historically fishless watersheds has profoundly restructured the aquatic food web, depressed the abundance, biomass, and diversity of native invertebrates, and endangered endemic vertebrate taxa. Lakes and their surrounding land are reciprocally connected through flows of organic matter, such as emerging aquatic insects; however, the extent to which trout introductions disrupt such flows to the terrestrial environment is poorly understood. Emerging aquatic insects are a potentially important prey source for birds; thus, we hypothesized that the community composition, diversity, and abundance of birds differ between fishless lakes and those stocked with trout due to reduced emerging aquatic insect biomass and diversity. We conducted lakeside bird surveys in headwater lake basins in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks for three summers (2014-2015, 2020) at a total of 39 lakes and quantified the emergence of mayflies between lake types using sticky traps. In addition to major reductions in mayfly densities, we documented lower overall bird abundance at stocked lakes, as well as turnover in avian community composition between stocked and fishless lakes. A fish eradication project at one lake between 2016 and 2019 allowed us to conduct a multiple-control before-after-control-impact (M-BACI) case study to assess changes in the avian community following fish removal. After fish were removed, bird abundance was two times higher than at the control lake. Given the global decline of insect populations and their importance in bird diets, this study reinforces the importance of studying aquatic and terrestrial habitats as interdependent systems and motivates the restoration of naturally fishless habitats impacted by introduced fishes.					; Patricelli, Gail/L-3730-2017	Clapp, Mary/0000-0001-5311-4720; 													2150-8925					SEP 2	2025	16	9							e70389	10.1002/ecs2.70389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70389													WOS:001563881800001

However, the regional characteristics of hydrological climate change in southwestern China and their dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, we reconstruct a hydroclimatic record from AD670 to AD1310 using a high-resolution stalagmite oxygen isotope record from Riyue Cave, Guizhou Province, southwestern China. The stalagmite delta 18O record shows a good agreement with hydrological reconstructions from cave and lake sediments in southern China during the overlapped period, indicating a monsoon precipitation increase during the late Dark Age Cold Period (DACP) and a monsoon precipitation decrease during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). Geological and historical records from the monsoonal region of China display a dipolar rainfall pattern in southern China and northern China, with a "wet north and dry south" pattern during the MCA and a "wet south and dry north" pattern during the DACP. Meanwhile, a rapid DACP-MCA transition at approximately AD960 +/- 30 was detected in Riyue record, which is widely observed in other climatic reconstructions in the mid- to low-latitude regions, indicating a fast global reorganization of atmospheric circulation within decades. Comparison shows that the rainfall pattern in the monsoonal region of China should be dominantly modulated by temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere and China which could influence the temperature gradients and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and secondly the internal variabilities such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Changes in temperature, ENSO and IOD could also cause the rapid transition from the DACP to the MCA.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 1	2025	675								113114	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113114		JUL 2025											WOS:001533029400001

Thermokarst Lakes of Taiga and Tundra Zones of the Siberian Arctic Based on Kanopus-V and Sentinel-2 Images	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The patterns of size distribution of thermokarst lakes in the tundra and taiga Arctic zones of northeastern Siberia have been studied based on space images from the Kanopus-V and Sentinel-2 satellites (with spatial resolutions of 2.1 and 20 m, respectively) acquired in the summer months of 2017-2021. The lakes are interpreted on a mosaic of Sentinel-2 satellite images and on 16 test plots (TPs) on Kanopus-V images in order to determine the number of lakes and their areas within each of the specified zones. Experimental histograms of distribution of the number and total areas of lakes by their sizes are obtained for the studied tundra and taiga zones in an extremely wide range of lake sizes from 50 to 10(8) m(2) based on the integration of data from images of different spatial resolution. The histograms of the distribution of the number of lakes by their sizes demonstrate a similar behavior in both zones, manifested in the growth of the number of lakes as their sizes decrease. It is shown that the main contribution to the total area of lakes is made by large lakes (more than 200 000 m(2)), the share of which exceeds 80% of the total area of lakes (in the tundra 82% and in the taiga zone 85%). The contribution of small lakes (less than 500 m(2)) to the total area of Arctic lakes in both tundra and taiga zones is negligible and does not exceed 0.20-0.17%, respectively. The characteristics of lake density and the degree of lake coverage of the studied territories are studied. It is shown that the lake coverage and density in the tundra is 1.9 and 2.5 times higher than in the taiga zone.																			0001-4338	1555-628X				DEC	2024	60	12					1607	1616		10.1134/S0001433825700276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001433825700276													WOS:001508279800007

Too Hot to Handle: A Meta-Analytical Review of the Thermal Tolerance and Adaptive Capacity of North American Sturgeon	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Understanding how ectotherms may fare with rising global temperatures and more frequent heatwaves is especially concerning for species already considered at-risk, such as long-lived, late-maturing sturgeon. There have been concerted efforts to collect data on the movement behavior and thermal physiology of North American sturgeon to enhance conservation efforts; thus, we sought to synthesize these data to understand how sturgeon respond to thermal stress and what capacity they have to acclimate and adapt to warming. Here, we combined a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, integrating field-based observations (distribution and spawning) and laboratory-based experiments (survival, activity, growth, metabolism, and upper thermal limits) for large-scale insights to understand the vulnerability of North American sturgeon to rising global temperatures. We summarized the preferred thermal habitat and thermal limits of sturgeon in their natural environment and using meta-analytical techniques, quantified the effect of prolonged temperature change on sturgeon whole-animal physiology and acute upper thermal limits. While acclimation did not have significant effects on physiological rates or survival overall, there were positive trends of activity and metabolism in young-of-the-year sturgeons, likely offset by negative trends of survival in early life. Notably, North American sturgeon have a greater capacity for thermal tolerance plasticity than other fishes, increasing upper thermal limits by 0.56 degrees C per 1 degrees C change in acclimation temperature. But with limited laboratory-based studies, more research is needed to understand if this is a sturgeon trait, or perhaps that of basal fishes in general. Importantly, with these data gaps, the fate of sturgeon remains uncertain as climate change intensifies, and physiological impacts across life stages likely limit ecological success.

Spatial heterogeneity in sediment phosphorus pools and phosphatase activity in a eutrophic reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agriculture is necessary for food production, but agricultural inputs of phosphorus (P) to waterways can lead to harmful algal blooms in downstream reservoirs. Some of the P that enters these water bodies can be stored in reservoir sediments and later contribute to internal P loading, supplementing external P loads carried in from rivers. Increased P can lead to harmful algal blooms. However, how P is cycling in the sediment of these water bodies varies spatially and temporally has been relatively unstudied. Our objective was to understand how P concentration and form vary spatiotemporally, as well as how P is processed in the sediment of the reservoir. We sampled 30 locations in both August and October 2018 around Milford Reservoir (Kansas), a man-made eutrophic reservoir with frequent harmful algal blooms. We collected water chemistry samples, field measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, and sediment samples to analyze for P chemical speciation and phosphatase enzyme activity. We show that P release by phosphatase activity was higher under anaerobic and basic conditions, which subsequently affects spatiotemporal variation in sediment P pools. We found that low oxygen positively influenced phosphatase activity and sediment P pools, and may drive high internal P loading and harmful algal blooms in the summer months. This research increased our understanding of P cycling in a reservoir highly impacted by agricultural inputs and contributed to a small but growing body of research on internal P loading in midwestern reservoirs. Agriculture can increase phosphorus (P) loading to reservoirs, but spatiotemporal P variation and organic processing are understudied. Low oxygen increased water P concentrations, sediment P pools, and phosphatase activity. This study provides information of what may drive high internal P loading rates in eutrophic reservoirs.

In this context, National Parks are the leading natural resources under protection. Since national parks are natural assets used for recreational and tourism purposes, they provide important contributions to the country's economy as well as the social benefit they provide to the society. Therefore, natural resources need to be included in the calculations of national income, which is a measure of the growth rate of countries, and economic value determination is needed for this. For this purpose, Beysehir Lake National Park, which is the second largest national park, has been valued. Contingent Valuation Method and Travel Cost Method are used in the appraisal. During the data collection phase, 383 samples were determined using the Proportional Sampling Method, and the surveys were conducted with visitors within the national park in the summer of 2019. According to the Conditional Valuation Method, 186.838.123 TL was calculated, 453.612.000 TL according to the Travel Cost Method and the total economic value was determined as 640.450.123 TL. The consumer surplus per visitor, that is, the fee that a visitor is willing to pay for a visit to the national park in one year, was calculated as 2.202 TL. All findings obtained with a stake in the country's national income in light of the economic value of Turkey and the second largest national park was revealed the existing potential. Its economic value should be evaluated in development policies, and its existing potential should be presented to the social benefit of people by protecting it within the framework of environmental protection policies.

J	Portielje, R; Rijsdijk, RE				Portielje, R; Rijsdijk, RE			Stochastic modelling of nutrient loading and lake ecosystem response in relation to submerged macrophytes and benthivorous fish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The strong stabilising effect of increased submerged macrophytes (charophytes) and benthivorous fish reduction on the clear water state was shown for shallow Lake Veluwe and Lake Wolderwijd. 2. The first two links in the chain of relationships from external phosphorus (P) loading to in-lake total-P concentrations to chlorophyll a concentrations to water transparency, showed a significant correlation with the areal fraction of coverage with charophytes. Higher coverages lead to (i) lower ratios of the in-lake total-P concentration compared with the volume weighted average concentration in the inlet water, indicating a higher retention of P in the presence of charophytes (ii) lower chlorophyll a to total-P ratios, indicating a positive effect of charophytes on top-down control of algae, and (iii) higher water transparency because of lower algal turbidity. Transparency further improved as a result of benthivorous fish reduction and a significant positive correlation between non-algal turbidity and benthivorous fish biomass. 3. A model was developed taking into account the inherent variability in precipitation and uncertainties in the empirical relationships determining phosphorus export from stream catchments and other sources and eutrophication variables in the receiving lakes. The model was used to compute (i) probability distributions for in-lake total-P, chlorophyll a and Secchi Disc transparency in relation to the coverage with charophytes and benthivorous fish biomass, and (ii) exceedence probabilities with respect to critical values for in-lake total-P and water transparency for several management scenarios. 4. The effects of an expected rise in external nutrient loading on the in-lake total-P and chlorophyll a concentrations and on water transparency can be compensated for by two proposed control measures: (i) extended treatment at a waste water treatment plant directly discharging into Lake Veluwe, and (ii) diverting the outlet of a stream draining a catchment with high fertilisation. The minimal internal charophyte coverage needed to sufficiently stabilise the clear water state and to meet with the objective of a summer mean water transparency of at least 1 m was estimated at well over 30% of the lake area, while the benthivorous fish stock should be maintained at the present level of c . 20 kg ha(-1) .																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2003	48	4					741	755		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01029.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01029.x													WOS:000181632400015
J	Kennedy, CR				Kennedy, CR			Interspecific interactions between larval digeneans in the eyes of perch, Perca fluviatilis	PARASITOLOGY												The changes in prevalence and abundance of the three species of metacercariae in the humour of the eyes of perch Perca fluviatilis in Slapton Ley, Devon, have been monitored over a period of 29 years. Earlier studies had revealed that Diplostomum gasterostei was originally the sole occupant of this niche, but Tylodelphis clavata colonised in 1073 and T. podicipina in 1976. A decline in the number of perch with heavy infections of D. gastrostri was significantly negatively correlated with population abundance of T. clavata and a decline in recruitment rate of D. gasterostei coincided with the population increase in T. podicipina over the period 1976 - 1979. It was suggested that the decline in population size of D. gasterostei was due to inter-specific competition, but this hypothesis could not be tested experimentally. Subsequent investigations, reported here, confirmed the decline when the data set was extended to 1085. A severe decline in the perch population over the winter of 1984-1985 resulted in the disappearance of D. gasterostei and T. podicipina and this was followed by a slow recovery from 1900 onwards. This natural experiment provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis. Only T. clavata survived throughout the perch crash and the population continued at pre-crash levels up to 1999. Its congener T. podicipina did not re-appear until 1991 land was probably a re-introduction: it did not attain pre-crash levels until 1999. It is likely that D. gasterostei survived the crash as it re-appeared in 1991, but was confined to young of the year fish and barely approached pre-crash levels even in 1999. Its continual low levels cannot be explained by changes in the lake or in densities of snail intermediate or bird definitive hosts. New data revealed that the suspensory ligaments of the eye were the preferred site of all three species and that the eye was partitioned out between them. The data from the post-crash period do not refute but rather confirm earlier conclusions that inter-specific competition is responsible for the decline in D. gasterostei and this remains the preferred hypothesis.																			0031-1820	1469-8161					2001	122			S			S13	S22		10.1017/S0031182000016851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000016851								11442192					WOS:000169818300003

The mine, which included primarily underground workings, a processing plant and a tailings Impoundment, operated intermittently over a period of less than 2 years in the late 1960's before being abandoned. An environmental assessment conducted in 1997 revealed that tailings seepage has a low pH and high metal concentrations, and is discharging into a small lake adjacent to the impoundment. The Arctic Gold and Silver Working Group was established in 1997 with the objective of guiding the development and selection of a rehabilitation plan for the abandoned mine facilities. The Working Group comprises representatives of affected stakeholders, including the Carcross-Tagish First Nation and various government departments. The development of a detailed rehabilitation plan commenced in 1998 with a detailed assessment of the environmental conditions at the site. A series of options for remediating the tailings were subsequently developed and each of the options underwent an evaluation to determine its probable effectiveness. Based on this evaluation, two options were "short-listed" for further consideration. The first consisted of consolidation and covering of the tailings, a well established technological approach. The second consisted of chemical amendment by heap leaching and reprocessing of the tailings, a technology that has become common in recent years although there are relatively few such cases in the North. The two short-listed options were compared on die basis of factors such as environmental benefits, estimated costs and the level of certainty associated with each of the cost estimates. The results of these comparative evaluations were submitted to the Arctic Gold and Silver Working Group who, following a review of all the options, selected the consolidation and cover option. The rehabilitation activities were implemented during summer 1999.																									2000							63	71																WOS:000189456000007

Harmful algal bloom impacts on foodweb structure in western Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Human-driven environmental change has caused harmful algal blooms to increase in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, yet our understanding of their impacts on foodwebs and the fisheries that they support remains incomplete. This information gap is especially conspicuous in Lake Erie (USA-Canada), where harmful algal blooms have been increasing owing to nonpoint source nutrient runoff and climate change. From a summer 2019 field investigation designed to test hypotheses concerning the effects of harmful algal blooms on western Lake Eries' foodweb, we confirmed that nanoplankton and netplankton primary production rates, cyanobacteria biomass, and microcystin, chlorophyll a, and turbidity concentrations were higher inside of the blooms than outside, with Secchi disk transparency being similar to 3-fold lower inside of these blooms. Harmful algal bloom sites also had higher levels of total and soluble reactive phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and silica than non-harmful algal bloom sites, with nitrate and nitrate showing the opposite pattern. Counter to expectations, crustacean zooplankton biomass was higher inside than outside the blooms due to more calanoid copepod and non-daphnid cladoceran biomass inside the harmful algal blooms; Daphnia spp., bosminid, cyclopoid copepod, and predatory cladoceran biomass did not differ between areas. Dreissenid mussel veligers were almost 10-fold lower inside than outside the blooms. Finally, fish community structure was near-identical between harmful algal bloom and non-bloom areas, except for Shiner (Notropis) species, which were more abundant inside. Collectively, our findings indicate that, despite their negative effects on water quality (e.g. toxin production, reduced water clarity), western Lake Erie harmful algal blooms are biologically productive and may not be a trophic dead end as is commonly believed. In discussing these findings, we identify knowledge gaps that can help fishery management agencies better understand how these blooms affect foodwebs and the fisheries that they support.

J	Guo, ZF; Liu, JQ; Chen, XY				Guo ZhengFu; Liu JiaQi; Chen XiaoYu			Effect of Miocene basaltic volcanism in Shanwang (Shandong Province, China) on environmental changes	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												Miocene (16-10 Ma) basalts, together with significantly well-preserved fossils (including animal and plant fossils) in the contemporaneously tephra-rich Maar sediments, are located in Shanwang volcanic region, Shandong Province, China. Distribution area of the basaltic eruption products is about 240 km(2). Detailed field observations indicate that most of basaltic rocks are fissure eruptive products and some are central eruptives constrained by linear faults. The well-preserved fossils in the lacustrine deposits have been considered to be a result of mass mortalities. Based on physically volcanologic modeling results, eruption column of the basaltic fissure activities in the Shanwang volcanic region is estimated to have entered the stratosphere. Petrographic observations indicate that the basalts have porphyritic textures with phenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar and alkali feldspar setting in groundmass of plagioclase feldspar, alkali feldspar, quartz, apatite and glass. Based on observations of tephra, tuff and tuffites collected in the Maar sediments of the Shanwang area, we determined major element oxide concentrations and volatile composition of melt inclusions in phenocrysts and matrix glasses by electron microprobe analysis. Volatile (including S, Cl, F and H2O) concentrations erupted into the stratosphere were estimated by comparing pre-and post-eruptive volatile concentrations. Our determination results show that contents of S, Cl, F and H2O emitted into the stratosphere were 0.18%-0.24%, 0.03%-0-05%, 0.03%-0.05% and 0.4%-0.6%, respectively, which was characterized by high-S contents erupted. Amounts of volatiles emitted in the Shanwang volcanic region are much higher than those in eruptions which had a substantial effect on climate and environment. According to the compositions and amounts of the volatiles erupted from the Miocene basaltic volcanism in Shanwang, we propose a hypothesis that volatile-rich basaltic volcanism could result in the mass mortalities by injecting volatiles (e.g., SO2, H2S, HCl, HF and H2O) into the stratosphere that would have triggered abrupt environmental changes (including formation of acid rain, temperature decline, ozone depletion, etc.) and altered lake chemistry, and subsequently volcanic ash fall buried and covered the dead animals and plants, forming well-preserved fossils in Shanwang Maar sediments.

PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF VOLCANIC AND HYDROTHERMAL HAZARDS IN YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK AND VICINITY	VOLCANOES: FORMATION, ERUPTIONS AND MODELLING												Possible future violent events in the active hydrothermal, magmatic, and tectonic system of Yellowstone National Park pose potential hazards to park visitors and infrastructure. Most of the national park and vicinity are sparsely populated, but significant numbers of people as well as park resources could nevertheless be at risk from these hazards. Depending on the nature and magnitude of a particular hazardous event and the particular time and season when it might occur, 70,000 to more than 100,000 persons could be affected; the most violent events could affect a broader region or even continent-wide areas. This assessment of such hazards is presented both as a guide for future activities of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) and to aid appropriate response planning by the National Park Service and surrounding agencies and communities. Although the assessment is presented here in some technical detail, this summary is intended to be understandable to non-scientists. The principal conclusions also will be made available in other forms, more accessible to general readers. The Yellowstone Plateau was built by one of Earth's largest young volcanic systems, having episodically erupted great volumes of both lava and explosively ejected pumiceous ash for more than 2 million years. These eruptive materials are products of two compositional types of subsurface magma: basaltic magma is relatively fluid and, in this setting, generally produces small to moderate volumes of lava in relatively brief eruptions; rhyolitic magma is more viscous and either can erupt effusively to produce small to large volumes of lava or explosively to produce coarse pumice and finer ash. The three largest Yellowstone eruptions produced blanketing deposits of rhyolitic ash so hot that they welded into sheets of dense rock covering large areas, extending beyond the national park. Each of them also produced a rain of ash that spread over much of western and central North America and beyond; these ash deposits are greater than 2 m thick near their eruptive sources and as much as a meter thick in Surrounding areas. Each of these three eruptions produced a caldera, or deep crater-like depression, tens of kilometers wide, formed by collapse of the ground surface into a partly emptied subterranean magma chamber. The latest of these three great eruptions formed the Yellowstone caldera. Renewed rhyolitic magma influx beneath the Yellowstone caldera in central Yellowstone National Park uplifted parts of the caldera floor and produced voluminous intracaldera lavas, the youngest of which extruded in a series of eruptive episodes about 164,000, 152,000, 114,000, 102,000, and 72,000 years ago. During the same span of time, generally smaller flows of both basalt and rhyolite have erupted in several areas outside the Yellowstone caldera: (1) northwest of the caldera, (2) near the southern boundary of the park, (3) in the basin of Island Park, west of Yellowstone National Park, and (4) especially in the southern part of a corridor between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs. Disruption of the Earth's surface by faulting and regional uplift characterize the geologic framework of Yellowstone Plateau volcanism. Some of the regional faults that bound the mountain ranges around the Yellowstone Plateau are capable of producing large-magnitude (M>7) earthquakes. In contrast, faults within the caldera are mainly small, produce smaller-magnitude (M 6.8), relatively shallow earthquakes, and reflect strains in the Earth's crust associated with magmatic intrusion and hydrothermal activity. Swarms of generally small earthquakes occurring within localized areas over restricted periods of time characterize much of the earthquake activity within and adjacent to the Yellowstone caldera. This seismicity is monitored by a network of seismographs within and adjacent to the park and is recorded and processed nearly in real time at the University of Utah as part of the YVO program and archived as a contribution to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Advanced National Seismic System database. Leveling surveys, satellite-based measurements, and geologic studies of former shorelines of Yellowstone Lake all show that the entire area of the Yellowstone caldera and a seismically active zone to the northwest undergo episodes of ground uplift and subsidence, sometimes encompassing the entire caldera and sometimes in more local and complex patterns of both uplift and subsidence. Such deformation in the Yellowstone region is monitored by YVO mainly through a network of continuously recorded Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers recorded at the University of Utah. The GPS data are incorporated as part of the National Science Foundation's EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, archived at UNAVCO and available through the YVO website (http://voIcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/index.html). The active hydrothermal system of Yellowstone National Park is one of the largest on Earth. Although accidents involving hot water injure Yellowstone visitors from time to time, conformance with normal Park Service procedures and regulations would ordinarily be sufficient to prevent most of them. By contrast, a commonly recurring, more acute hazard at Yellowstone is the explosive ejection of steam, water, and rock with no associated volcanism. These hydrothermal explosions are caused by hot subsurface waters that flash to steam, breaking the overlying rocks that confine them and ejecting the debris to form a crater. It is generally not clear just what triggers these events, but possible triggers include strong local earthquakes, seasonal or long-term declines in ground water levels, and changes in the underground distribution of heat. Many hydrothermal explosions have few if any premonitory indications. At least 26 hydrothermal explosions have been documented in the 126-year historic record of the national park, and others undoubtedly escaped observation. Since the Yellowstone Plateau was last glaciated, ending about 16,000 years ago, at least 18 large hydrothermal explosions have formed craters wider than 100 m. Conservatively, at least one rock-hurling explosion every two years is estimated to occur at Yellowstone, but because most of these events are small and usually Occur when few visitors are present, the likelihood of harm to park visitors is relatively small. The average recurrence of an explosion that could cause personal injury is probably between 10 and 100 years. Average recurrence time of an explosion large enough to produce a 100-m-diameter crater is probably about 200 years, but such an event could expel rocks and other hot debris more than 2 km from the explosion site. Most hydrothermal-explosion craters at Yellowstone are in the Firehole River geyser basins, beneath or around Yellowstone Lake, and in the southern part of the Norris- Mammoth Corridor. In addition to hydrothermal explosions, toxic gases-mainly carbon dioxide and hydro-en sulfide-pose hazards. Concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere are generally low at Yellowstone, but they can build Lip in confined areas such as valleys, caves, and tunnels, especially during windless conditions. Most areas with toxic-gas hazards can be kept off-limits to people, but gas emissions should continue to be monitored. No volcanic eruption has Occurred in Yellowstone National Park or vicinity in the last 70,000 years or more. Nevertheless, several types of volcanic eruption hazards are possible in the future. Basaltic lavas have erupted around the margins of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field throughout its evolution. These relatively low-viscosity lavas generally erupt rapidly, most eruptions lasting no more than a few weeks to a few months though the largest flow fields may accumulate in multiple eruptions lasting months to years. The average period between basaltic eruptions in the Yellowstone region since formation of the Yellowstone caldera has been about 16,000 years. The most likely location of a future basaltic eruption is within the basin of Island Park, west of Yellowstone, but basalts could erupt anywhere in a 40-km-wide band around the caldera. Future basaltic eruptions could cover several square kilometers with lava up to tens of meters thick. Basaltic ash and cinders also might blanket hundreds of square kilometers to depths of a few meters to a few centimeters, and if a vent emerged beneath water or saturated ground, more explosive eruptions could cause significant destruction, such as blasting down trees or structures. Large rhyolitic lava flows, many having volumes greater than 10 km(3), have erupted within the Yellowstone caldera during the past 170,000 years. Initially these larger eruptions were preceded by explosively ejected pumice and ash. In a similar future eruption, ejecta could bury broad areas, locally to many meters. Subsequent lava extrusion could last for years, covering areas as great as 350-400 km2 to thicknesses of tens or hundreds of meters and volumes of 5 to more than 50 km3. Because such voluminous rhyolitic lava eruptions have not been observed anywhere in historical time, it is uncertain how long such an event might continue; extrusion might be orders of magnitude faster than for smaller flows. The probability of a future large intracaldera rhyolitic eruption is difficult to estimate. Available data suggest a highly episodic behavior of past eruptions of this sort, periods of a few thousand years characterized by numerous eruptions being separated by longer intervals of about 12,000 to 38,000 years without eruption. One statistical measure of eruption probabilities based on this episodic behavior suggests an average recurrence of 20,000 years. The fact that no such eruption has occurred for more than 70,000 years may mean that insufficient eruptible magma remains beneath the Yellowstone caldera to produce another largevolume lava flow. Small rhyolitic lava flows postdating the Yellowstone caldera have erupted mainly north of the caldera, but one such flow also lies near the South Entrance to the park. Two distinct types of primary hazards might be associated with small rhyolitic eruptions at Yellowstone. Just as for larger rhyolitic lava eruptions, initial venting almost certainly would explosively eject rhyolitic pumice; the coarser fragments would fall back close to the vent, but finer pumiceous ash would enter the atmosphere and fall downwind for many kilometers. Structures, power lines, etc. could be damaged by ash loading, especially if eruption were accompanied by heavy rain. The initial explosive eruptions could last a few hours to several weeks and be followed by viscous extrusion of rhyolitic lava, covering several square kilometers to tens of meters thick; lava could continue to extrude for many months or even years. Viscous rhyolitic lava would advance much more slowly than a basaltic flow; most affected facilities could be safely evacuated and perhaps relocated. The average recurrence period of small extracaldera rhyolitic eruptions in the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field is about 50,000 years. In addition to the primary hazards posed by any future eruption of basalt or a small or large rhyolitic lava eruption, important possible secondary consequences include wildland fires, debris flows, and floods triggered by the displacement of surface drainages by lava. Systematic seismic, deformation, and hydrothermal monitoring by YVO is likely to provide indicators of any impending volcanic eruptive activity in Yellowstone National Park. Premonitory events detected by such monitoring might include multiple shallow earthquake swarms of increasing frequency and intensity, the ground vibrations called volcanic tremor, localized uplift of the surface, ground cracks, and anomalous gas emissions. Of all the possible hazards from a future volcanic eruption in the Yellowstone region, by far the least likely would be another explosive caldera-forming eruption of great volumes of rhyolitic ash. Abundant evidence indicates that hot magma continues to exist beneath Yellowstone, but it is uncertain how much of it remains liquid, how well the liquid is interconnected, and thus how much remains eruptible. Any eruption of sufficient volume to form a new caldera probably would occur only from within the present Yellowstone caldera, and the history of postcaldera rhyolitic eruptions strongly suggests that the subcaldera magma chamber is now a largely crystallized mush. The probability of another major caldera-forming Yellowstone eruption, in the absence of strong premonitory indications of major magmatic intrusion and degassing beneath a large area of the caldera, can be considered to be below the threshold of useful calculation.

Over the years, raw material sourcing has emerged as an important research topic in lithic analysis as it can allow for the identification of resource extraction points and transport distances as a means to infer other aspects of hominin behaviour that are of high evolutionary significance. The goal of this article is to review and synthesise the aims, methods, challenges, and knowledge on raw material sourcing from Plio-Pleistocene contexts in Eastern Africa. Beginning with a review of the Oldowan and Acheulean records, four over-arching patterns are identified based on evidence from 130 localities. First, hominin toolmakers regularly exerted selective criteria when choosing raw materials by way of opportunistic and more specialised procurement strategies. Second, the fragmentation of technological activities across the palaeolandscape emerged as a behavioural characteristic among Oldowan toolmakers before the first appearance datum of the Acheulean. Third, hominins across Eastern Africa preferentially utilised igneous rock types followed by metamorphic and sedimentary lithologies mirroring the regional lithostratigraphy. Finally, Acheulean toolmakers largely mimicked their Oldowan counterparts in terms of raw material provisioning until the late Early Pleistocene, when they began to engage in qualitatively different behaviour best evidenced by stone transport over longer distances. This state of archaeological knowledge serves as the basis to then review the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of raw material sourcing followed by interpretive challenges. On a fundamental level, the identification of raw material sources is contingent on the implementation of a systematic sequence of analysis in which the resulting data abide to the provenance postulate. This serves to preface a devoted section on the array of analytical methods that can be successfully employed by archaeologists to source raw materials. Proven and innovative methods are identified by bringing into dialogue key factors such as accuracy, precision, reproducibility, discriminatory power, sensitivity, destructiveness, throughput, cost, ease, and the question of spatial scale. According to cost-benefit considerations, analytical methods that fall under the umbrella of geochemical fingerprinting are found to generally outperform macroscopic and petrographic techniques. It is also argued that characterising non-obsidian lithologies is best accomplished using more than one analytical method, with the understanding that once positive baseline results are obtained subsequent testing can be narrowed down from a methodological standpoint. Regardless of the characterisation method, it is imperative to implement effective means to analyse the resulting data, which constitutes this article's penultimate section. Ranging from traditional graphical data representations to multivariate statistics and emerging branches of artificial intelligence, there are countless means through which characteristic source signals can be identified regardless of rock type. The final section reviews common interpretive challenges when studying raw material provisioning in deep time. While the concepts of mobility, time-averaging, recycling, source differentiation, and selection criteria each present unique challenges, it is argued that they can be reasonably overcome by way of multidisciplinary lines of evidence. Ultimately, it is found that the future of raw material sourcing from Plio-Pleistocene contexts in Eastern Africa is promising given what is currently known along with the subfield's robust foundations.

J	Clow, DW; Mast, MA; Campbell, DH				Clow, DW; Mast, MA; Campbell, DH			Controls on surface water chemistry in the upper Merced River basin, Yosemite National Park, California	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Surface water draining granitic bedrock in Yosemite National Park exhibits considerable variability in chemical composition, despite the relative homogeneity of bedrock chemistry. Other geological factors, including the jointing and distribution of glacial till, appear to exert strong controls on water composition. Chemical data from three surface water surveys in the upper Merced River basin conducted in August 1981, June 1988 and August 1991 were analysed and compared with mapped geological, hydrological and topographic features to identify the solute sources and processes that control water chemistry within the basin during baseflow. Water at most of the sampling sites was dilute, with alkalinities ranging from 26 to 77 mu equiv. l(-1). Alkalinity was much higher in two subcatchments, however, ranging from 51 to 302 mu equiv. l(-1). Base cations and silica were also significantly higher in these two catchments than in the rest of the watershed. Concentrations of weathering products in surface water were correlated to the fraction of each subcatchment underlain by surficial material, which is mostly glacial till. Silicate mineral weathering is the dominant control on concentrations of alkalinity, silica and base cations, and ratios of these constituents in surface water reflect the composition of local bedrock. Chloride concentrations in surface water samples varied widely, ranging from < 1 to 96 mu equiv. l(-1). The annual volume-weighted mean chloride concentration in the Merced River at the Happy Isles gauge from 1968 to 1990 was 26 mu equiv. l(-1), which was five times higher than in atmospheric deposition (4-5 mu equiv, l(-1)), suggesting that a source of chloride exists within the watershed. Saline groundwater springs, whose locations are probably controlled by vertical jointing in the bedrock, are the most likely source of the chloride. Sulphate concentrations varied much less than most other solutes, ranging from 3 to 14 mu equiv. l(-1). Concentrations of sulphate in quarterly samples collected at the watershed outlet also showed relatively little variation, suggesting that sulphate may be regulated to some extent by a within-watershed process, such as sulphate adsorption.

Four major rivers, many smaller creeks, five wastewater treatment plants, and groundwater discharge to the Chehalis River. Flooding is a major problem in the relatively flat areas surrounding the cities of Chehalis and Centralia. As a result, construction of a flood-control dam in the upper basin has been proposed. One major concern of constructing a dam is the potentially severe impacts to fish health and habitat. The Chehalis River has routinely violated water quality standards for primarily temperature and dissolved oxygen. CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional (longitudinal and vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model, was used to simulate the Chehalis River, including free flowing river stretches and stratified (in summer) lake-like stretches. The goals of this research were to assess the flood retention structure's impacts to water quality, as well as river responses to potential climate change scenarios. In order to use the model to achieve these goals, calibration to field data for flow, temperature, and water quality constituents was performed for the years 2013 and 2014. Once calibration was complete, model scenarios for future climate conditions and dam operating regimes were conducted. Future conditions showed predictions of warmer water temperatures and slight changes to water quality conditions on the river. As fish in the area prefer cooler water temperatures, this could pose a threat to fish health and habitat. Flood retention structures with the purpose of flood retention only (only operating during times of flooding) gave model predictions for daily maximum temperature higher than structures that employed flood retention and flow augmentation (operating during all times of the year). This suggested the management of flow passage or retention by the dam is important for water quality on the river.																					978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							203	217																WOS:000404786200019

However, only a few such studies have been concerned with Corbicula Japonica, which is the most popular brackish-water species in Japan. C japonica is a tiny suspension-feeding bivalve very abundant in the littoral region of Lake Shinji, Japan. Although the lake is well fed with nutrients, it still remains less eutrophied than other lakes with comparable external nitrogen and phosphorus loadings. Also, less turbid water often develops in littoral regions of the lake where bivalves dominate. Attributing these facts to the functional role of C japonica, we have adapted a microcosm approach utilizing a continuous-flow microcosm and a batch system technique subjected to several selected temperature conditions to assess the bivalve's role in lake ecosystem. Results show that filtration, excretion and respiration rates of C. japonica significantly depend on temperature having a maximum value for temperatures close to 25 degreesC. Also C japonica selectively grazes phytoplankton with high content of Chl.a, creating a possibility for the change of the phytoplankton composition in the lake. C. japonica shortcuts the internal nutrient circulation, excreting ca. 87 % of the nitrogen uptake and ca. 60 % of the phosphorus uptake. At the end, the laboratory results were extrapolated to the scale of the whole lake and the mass balance of nitrogen and phosphorus for summer and wintertime was evaluated. The fisheries output consisted 15 % of external loading of River Hii, it is suggested that C. Japonica is very efficient tool for natural eutrophication control during summertime. Also, it results that abatement of pollutant loading is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving and restoring water quality and quantity, and ecosystem function.																									2001							764	769																WOS:000175456900108
J	Puczko, K				Puczko, Katarzyna			Estimation of summer CO2 emission from the littoral of lakes of different trophic levels in North-Eastern Poland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Evaluating the extent of CO2 emissions from lakes exhibiting diverse trophic levels is essential for advancing our current understanding of the influence of ecological and climatic processes on these ecosystems. This research consisted in measuring CO2 emission during the day hours from lakes located in the Suwalki Lake District and was carried out in the littoral zone using a closed floating chamber. Based on the trophic indexes, oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and dystrophic lakes were distinguished. The emission from all investigated lakes ranged from -0.354 g (CO2) per m h(-1) to 0.142 g (CO2) per m h(-1). This research confirms that lakes could be absorbers or emitters of CO2 to the atmosphere. Only the Arkadia reservoir was in a state close to equilibrium in the water-air phase system. Most of the lakes were oversaturated with CO2 resulting in its release to the atmosphere. Their CO2 excess is widely attributed to in-lake oxidation of terrestrially organic matter. The humic lake despite lower production at the level of about 80 mgC m(-2) d(-1) compared to the other lakes (net production > 100) showed a negative CO2 gradient in the water-to-air system, which resulted in the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. Both natural and anthropogenic factors are crucial in controlling the rate at which CO2 is released into the atmosphere. An emphasis should be placed on controlling external loadings of organic matter, where decomposition could release CO2 to the water column and oversaturation results in higher CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Engaging in such research has the potential to aid in the formulation of water conservation management strategies. These investigations can further contribute to the development of lake conservation strategies that specifically address the mitigation of CO2 emissions from these aquatic ecosystems into the atmosphere.

Our results support concepts of a dominantly humid period persisting until ca. 5 ka, succeeded by a significantly drier phase with weaker monsoon, including various prominent drying pulses. Throughout the Holocene, plant diversity at Lonar was composed of a variable proportion of herbaceous PFTs (ca. 40-60%) and mainly angiosperm woody PFTs. Changes in herbaceous diversity account for a considerable part of the observed PFT data variability. PCA analysis reveals a total of four partly alternating diversity associations (DAs) interpretable in terms of vegetation spanning from drier Savanna and dry deciduous forest to (semi-) evergreen woody vegetation, mainly recorded in older strata. It is shown that the succession of the DAs is largely triggered by climate change inferred from other proxies. Correlation analysis with geochemical data testifies that the diversity signal obtained is largely unaffected by sedimentary processes and detrital inflow, highlighting the potential of this archive to reflect 'true' diversity signals, rather than artefacts of sedimentary processes. While warm and humid conditions promoted diversity, drying and weak monsoon tended to cause diversity loss. In contrast, the relative diversity of dry herbs increased during drier periods. Short-term variability in our data is evident in varying diversity percentages of single PFTs and their ratios. Changing ratios of dry on mesic herbs, the relation of shrub and tree diversity, tropical on temperate PFTs, and total plant diversity are likely related to solar cycles. Evidence for recurrent cooling episodes through solar forcing comes from the observed coincidence of Grand Solar Minima and minima in the tropical/temperate PFT ratio.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2023	33	5					491	504		10.1177/09596836231151801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836231151801		JAN 2023											WOS:000919999900001
J	Robinson, AG; Rudat, JH; Banks, CJ; Wiles, RLF				Robinson, AG; Rudat, JH; Banks, CJ; Wiles, RLF			Petroleum geology of the Black Sea	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Black Sea comprises two extensional basins formed in a back-are setting above the northward subducting Tethys Ocean, close to the southern margin of Eurasia. The two basins coalesced late in their post-rift phases in the Pliocene, forming the present single depocentre. The Western Black Sea was initiated in the Aptian, when a part of the Moesian Platform (now the Western Pontides of Turkey) began to rift and move away to the south-east. The Eastern Black Sea probably formed by separation of the Mid-Black Sea High from the Shatsky Ridge during the Palaeocene to Eocene. Subsequent to rifting, the basins were the sites of mainly deep water deposition; only during the Late Miocene was there a major sea-level fall, leading to the development of a relatively shallow lake. Most of the margins of the Black Sea have been extensively modified by Late Eocene to recent compression associated with closure of the Tethys Ocean. Gas chromatography- mass spectrometry and carbon isotope analysis of petroleum and rock extracts suggest that most petroleum occurrences around the Black Sea can be explained by generation from an oil-prone source rock of most probably Late Eocene age (although a wider age range is possible in the basin centres). Burial history modelling and source kitchen mapping indicate that this unit is currently generating both oil and gas in the post-rift basin. A Palaeozoic source rock may have generated gas condensate in the Gulf of Odessa. In Bulgarian waters, the main plays are associated with the development of an Eocene foreland basin (Kamchia Trough) and in extensional structures related to Western Black Sea rifting. The latter continue into the Romanian shelf where there is also potential in rollover anticlines due to gravity sliding of Neogene sediments. In the Gulf of Odessa gas condensate has been discovered in several compressional anticlines and there is potential in older extensional structures. Small gas and oil discoveries around the Sea of Azov point to further potential offshore around the Central Azov High, In offshore Russia and Georgia there are large culminations on the Shatsky Ridge, but these are mainly in deep water and may have poor reservoirs. There are small compressional structures off the northern Turkish coast related to the Pontide deformation; these may include Eocene turbidite reservoirs. The extensional fault blocks of the Andrusov Ridge (Mid-Black Sea High) are seen as having the best potential for large hydrocarbon volumes, but in 2200 m of water.																			0264-8172					MAR	1996	13	2					195	223		10.1016/0264-8172(95)00042-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0264-8172(95)00042-9													WOS:A1996TX49200004
J	Löffler, R; Steinicke, E				Löffler, R; Steinicke, E			The consequences of counterurbanization in the Californian high mountainous zone	MITTEILUNGEN DER OSTERREICHISCHEN GEOGRAPHISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT												The consequences of counterurbanization in the Californian high mountainous zone. While the number of emigrants from California clearly surpassed that of immigrants from other parts of the U.S. since 1990, things are different rent in the Sierra Nevada: due to domestic migration the population kept increasing in this region, affecting both the zone of foothills - that has become part of the Sacramento Metropolitan Area meanwhile - and various regions at high elevations far removed from metropolitan areas ("counterurbanization "). In this paper first results of a project supported by the Austrian Science Foundation are presented, focusing on the effects of settlement growth in high mountainous areas, a phenomenon rarely taken notice of so far in research into demographic deconcentration, with regard to their impact on socio-economic conditions. Though recent population growth in the High Sierra definitely slowed down in comparison with pre-1990 decades, private land available for residential development has become scarce, even though the upper limit of settlement has surpassed 2400 metres in the Lake Tahoe/Donner region and even 2600 metres in the Mammoth Lakes area by now. Tourism is the most important factor for High Sierra counterurbanization - oil the one hand many of those who had moved here from Californian metropolitan areas had had become acquainted with, and learned to appreciate, the high quality of life in the High Sierra during vacations or outings before, and oil the other hand tourism had become a major source of income in this region. The newcomers since 1990 are predominantly while, well-educated, in the higher household income ranges and do not fall into the senior citizens category. Due to the high demand for new housing real estate prices have risen excessively, causing an additional problem besides the planning and ecological problems resulting from settlement expansion in high mountainous regions anyway, namely a potential conflict between the local population and the newcomers. The study finally discusses various planning deficits in the Sierra Nevada, suggesting the possibility of adopting specific land use models developed for the Eastern Alps in order to prevent undesireable dispersed settlement patterns.																			0029-9138						2004	146						221	246																WOS:000227520900013

The objective of the study was to estimate the annual input of nutrients (N, P) resulting from avian excrement, deposited by birds feeding out of the lake and returning to its waters for breeding or roosting, as compared to the input by the rivers that enter in the lake. Two years are compared: 1981-82 and 1990-91. About 1600-2000 breeding herons and cormorants, 20 000-33 000 wintering ducks, gulls and cormorants and 1-2.4 million starlings deposited about 5800 kg total N in 1981-82 and 7640 kg in 1990-91. Respectively, 2000 and 2530 kg total P were deposited over the same time periods.These represent 0.7% and 0.4% of the total N input of the lake and 2.4 and 6.6% of the total P input in 1981-82 and 1990-91. Starlings account for 74% of the N and mallards most of the rest. P input by starlings (36% in 1981-82, 41% in 1990-91), and by mallards and herons (35% and 27% in 1981-82 and 22% and 24% in 1990-91 respectively) plays an appreciable role among birds. During the plant growing period (April-September), the contribution by birds can increase to 37% of total P input of the lake. Piscivorous bird colonies concentrate Phosphorus 42 times more within the colony than outside the colony. Overall, the role birds play in total N and P input is relatively small due to very high inputs from human sewage and agriculture run off. The monthly mean concentration of the water of the two rivers reaches currently 10 mg l-1 of N (to 23 mg during peak floods) and 394 mg m-3 of P (to 468 mg during peak floods). Earlier, for example in the 1960's, water in Brittany only contained 0.1 to 1.1 mg l-1 of N and 1 to 5 mg m-3 of P during the maximum flow period. At this time, birds could probably have represented annually up to 37% of the N input and up to 95% of the P input to the lake.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						133	147		10.1007/BF00027848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027848													WOS:A1994NK39900014

Hyper-arid climatic zones, known for their extreme temperatures and precipitation, have complex interactions due to changing climatic conditions. The study investigated a shallow core of 5 m from a lacustrine environment in the marginal part of the Little Rann of Kachchh, Kachchh, Western India. The hyper-arid climate and active tectonism make the site crucial for reconstructing changes in the Holocene epoch, which is known to have experienced rapid climatic shifts affecting ancient human settlers. The core has been subjected to a multiproxy (grain size analysis, elemental geochemistry, environmental magnetism, organic carbon, palynology, and chronology) assessment for the three periods of varying environmental conditions during Greenlandian (similar to 11-8.2 ka), Northgrippian (similar to 8.2-4.2 ka), and Meghalayan (similar to 4.2-2 ka) stages of the Holocene epoch. The Early Holocene sediments suggest arid conditions with high-energy depositional environments and weak monsoons, transitioning to fluctuating monsoonal activity by the Middle Holocene. The Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum (similar to 6-5 ka) marks a peak in monsoonal intensity, with heightened chemical weathering and organic productivity. In contrast, the Late Holocene is characterized by reduced hydrological variability and episodic climatic perturbations, including the 4.2 ka arid event. The climatic conditions during the prominent short-lived arid episode (8.2 ka) exhibit contrasting anomalies, revealing intriguing environmental patterns in the region due to the lack of response by the hyper-arid landscape. These findings provide valuable insights into the unique behavior of hyper-arid regions and their relevance to broader regional climatic reconstructions, with caution.

Response of phytoplankton to ecological engineering remediation of a Canadian Shield Lake affected by acid mine drainage	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					5th Annual Conference of the American-Ecological-Engineering-Society	MAY 18-20, 2005	Ohio States Univ, Columbus, OH	Amer Ecol Engn Soc	Ohio States Univ			Multivariate analyses were used to relate changes in water chemistry with those in the composition of the phytoplankton in two adjacent northern Ontario shield Lakes in Canada. One of the lakes is affected by both acid mine drainage (AMD) and a succession of remediation measures. The other, much larger lake is pristine and was monitored for both water quality and phytoplankton. The AMD lake, already contaminated at the start of the 17-year project, experienced further increases in Zn concentrations from around 10 mg L-1 to 35 mg L-1 and a pH decrease from 5 to 3 during the project. Over the same period, phytoplankton diversity declined from 52 taxa in 59 samples to 42 taxa in 74 samples. Only Ochromonas spp. and Chlamydomonas spp., apparently tolerant of a wide range of physical and chemical conditions, were consistently present in both lakes. Other taxa (Peridinium, Pinnularia and Euglena) were frequent in the AMD lake in the early stages of the project but then declined. Asterionella and Botrycoccus (although common in the pristine lake), were rarely observed in the AMD lake. Lepocinclis proliferated as metal concentrations increased and pH declined in the AMD lake but was rarely found in the clean lake. Such gradual adaptation or changes in phytoplankton populations have not been reported previously for such extreme chemical conditions. The multivariate statistical analysis (PCA, CCA, DCA) revealed that the highest number of taxa were found to be controlled by pH and Ni in the years 1986-1992. One-third of the taxa in that period were more closely associated with pH alone. In the late stages of the study (1999-2003) the predominant controlling factors appeared to be metals and conductivity Most of the taxa followed the time/pH/metal axis, suggesting that occurrence changed with slowly changing water conditions. Those taxa which fell outside the time/pH/Zn/Cu/Al axis included mostly Chrysophytes, Cryptophytes, and Chlorophytes, although there were some Euglenophyceae and diatoms in this group. By the end of the study in 2003, the combined effect of the restoration measures brought about the development of an extensive periphytic underwater meadow, along with a slight improvement in water quality and an increase in the number of phytoplankton taxa.

Mercury distribution and transport in a contaminated river system in Kazakhstan and associated impacts on aquatic biota	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The River Nura in Central Kazakhstan has been heavily polluted by Hg originating from an acetaldehyde plant. A number of studies were undertaken to investigate the transport, fate and bioavailability of Hg in this river system. The sediments within a 20 km section of the river downstream of the effluent outfall canal are highly polluted and are acting as a strong source of surface water contamination. Mercury transport in the river is dominated by the remobilization of contaminated bed sediments and river bank erosion during the annual spring flood. Peak Hg concentrations in unfiltered surface water samples during a larger than usual flood event in 2004 were in the order of 1600-4300 ng L-1. The majority of the particulate-bound Hg appears to be sedimented in the shallow Intumak reservoir similar to 75 km downstream of the source of the pollution, leading to a drop in aqueous Hg concentrations by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, background concentrations of Hg in surface water are not reached until at least 200 km downstream, and during the flood period Hg is also detected in the terminal wetlands of the river. Mercury concentrations in sediment cores taken from the river bed in the most contaminated section of the Nura ranged from 9.95 to 306 mg kg(-1). Methylmercury (MeHg) levels in shallow sediment cores were highest in surface sediments and ranged between 4.9 and 39 mu g kg(-1), but were generally less than 0.1% of total Hg (THg). A significant inverse relationship was found between THg concentrations and the percentage of MeHg formed in the sediments, irrespective of the sampling depth. The observed relationship was confirmed by comparison with results from a different river system, indicating that it may be true also for other highly contaminated aquatic systems. It is hypothesized that at high THg levels in severely contaminated sediments, the accumulation of MeHg may be limited by increasingly efficient demethylation processes, and that this underlying trend in sediments is the reason why MeHg levels in surface water are often found to be higher at less contaminated sites compared to upstream sites. Mercury concentrations in biota in the most contaminated section of the river were 15-20 times higher than background levels. Fish were found to be impacted for more than 125 km downstream from the source, indicating significant transport of dissolved MeHg to downstream areas and/or in-situ MeHg production in less contaminated downstream reaches. There were also indications that impoundments may increase the bioavailability of Hg. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main water source into the Dead Sea is runoff, and its level is highly sensitive to the annual rainfall in the upper Jordan River drainage basin. Here, we summarize relevant data about present and past surface-water hydrology in the drainage basin and water input into the Dead Sea. The lower Jordan River, with a natural mean annual discharge of similar to 1100 106 m(3) yr(-1), drains Mediterranean to semiarid areas in northern Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Additional water is contributed from tributaries such as the Zarqa River (64 10(6) m(3) yr(-1)). The diversion of water from these and other sources since the 1960s to an inflow of only similar to 210 10(6) m(3) yr(-1) caused a 20 m decline of the Dead Sea level. The ephemeral Nahal Arava drains hyperarid areas south of the Dead Sea and contributes small volumes of water (similar to 5 10(6) m(3) yr(-1)) but experiences occasional large floods (up to 1000 m(3) s(-1)); the smaller, steep ephemeral tributaries west of the Dead Sea produce relatively large fl oods (up to 775 m(3) s(-1)) due to their wetter headwaters, but their volumes are relatively small (<3 10(6)m(3)). The annual inflow (similar to 200 10(6)m(3) yr(-1)) to the Dead Sea from the eastern, semiarid tributaries is divided between base flows (similar to 65% of annual discharge) and winter fl oods. In the arid part of the basin, transmission losses and recharge into the shallow alluvial aquifers and probably also to the deeper aquifers during fl oods are directly related to flow volume. Transmission losses in Nahal Zin decrease with flood magnitude from similar to 86% to 100% in small fl oods of <10 m(3) s(-1) to similar to 10% for large floods of up to 1500 m(3) s(-1). During the largest floods, the volume of these losses can exceed 4 10(6) m(3). Rare paleofloods during the past 2000 yr in the Negev were 2-3 times larger than present-day measured floods. The temporal distribution of paleofloods shows that periods with a high frequency of large floods alternate with periods of few large floods. Periods with a high frequency of large floods correlate with high Dead Sea levels, and a low frequency of floods correlates with low lake levels.

Comparison of Different Foliar-Fertilization Strategies on Yield, Fruit Size and Quality of 'Nules' Clementine Mandarin	VII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MINERAL NUTRITION OF FRUIT CROPS	Acta Horticulturae				7th International Symposium on Mineral Nutrition of Fruit Crops	MAY 19-25, 2012	Chanthaburi, THAILAND	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				Foliar fertilizers reduce the potential for nutrients to accumulate in soil, move in run-off to surface waters (streams, lakes, ocean), and leach into the groundwater (drinking water supply), where they can contribute to salinity, eutrophication and nitrate contamination, leading to deleterious effects on the environment and human health. Thus, it is prudent to replace soil-applied fertilizer, at least in part, with foliar-applied fertilizer. Foliar fertilization is a rapid, efficient way to improve crop nutrient status during periods of high nutrient demand or when soil conditions (low temperature, salinity, pH) render soil nutrients and soil-applied fertilizers less available to the plant's roots. Foliar fertilization provides nutrients required for photosynthesis and other important metabolic functions essential to plant growth and productivity. However, not all nutrients move efficiently into leaves or other target organs. A priori knowledge (research) is necessary to develop a foliar fertilization program for a crop. Growers need this information to make cost-effective choices. Yield losses resulted when 'Nules' Clementine mandarin trees (Citrus reticulata) were sprayed with water containing no fertilizer. Thus, to attain yields equal to or greater than untreated control trees, foliar-fertilization strategies must compensate for the negative effect of application. For citrus, the standard time for applying foliar fertilizers is when leaves are 1/3 to 2/3 expanded (March-April) to take advantage of the thin cuticle, yet large surface area. Foliar fertilizers applied at this time to 'Nules' Clementine mandarin trees increased leaf concentrations of the applied nutrients through September (standard leaf analysis) (P < 0.0001); other application times had no effect on September leaf nutrient status, except boron applied at 10% anthesis. Winter prebloom foliar-applied low-biuret urea increased the 2-year cumulative yield (P = 0.0197) and 2-year average yield (P = 0.0273) of commercially valuable size fruit compared to all other treatments, except boron applied at 2/3-leaf expansion.																			0567-7572	2406-6168	978-90-66052-99-4				2013	984						247	255		10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.984.28	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.984.28													WOS:000323639300028

GREECE AND NORTH MACEDONIA: BREAKTHROUGH IN BILATERAL RELATIONS	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA												After the collapse of the united Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the so-called "Macedonian question" was considered the strongest constraining and destabilizing factor to integration processes in the Balkans in general and the post-Yugoslav space in particular. It was an unsolvable problem in the bilateral relations between Greece and the neighboring Macedonia (recently known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM). The main value of the problem is that the Greek side considered it unlawful and immoral to use its historical, cultural and linguistic features by the current Slavic state for its own purposes, which could create sufficient preconditions for separatist manifestations not only in Greece but also in Bulgaria. Furthermore, the use of ancient symbols by the Macedonian side as its state insignia (for example, the Vergina Sun, official language or citizenship) provoked resistance from the Greeks. In addition, the unresolved Macedonian question blocked Skopje's entry into the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union structures. The Greek government was able to enlist the support of not only the local population, but also its main partners among the EU and NATO member states. A long-awaited GreekMacedonian agreement was signed near the Prespa border lake after lengthy and thorough negotiations in the summer of 2018. Undoubtedly, it was the result of a compromise solution on the main issues causing mutual discontent. As the Prespa Agreement outcome, the Republic of North Macedonia appeared on the political map of Europe in February 2019. In fact, immediately after the Prespa Agreement conclusion, a serious impetus and breakthrough were given not only to continue mutually beneficial cooperation between the Hellenic Republic and the North Macedonia, but also to intensify the negotiation process for Skopje's accession to the NATO already in March 2020 and the European Union on an earlier date.

The purpose of the research is to assess the ecological state of the lake and the coastal zone and to develop a landscaping project. Hydrochemical studies revealed supersaturation of the surface layers of water with oxygen and deficiency at the bottom, the increase of nutrient content, a high content of organic substances, and increased pH values of the water. All of the abovementioned indicates an intensively ongoing process of eutrophication. The basis of the community was represented by rotifers. The summer abundance of zooplankton over the years varied from 406.2 thousand un./m3 to 4120.9 thousand un./m3, biomass from 1.6 g/m3 to 12.0 g/m3. By the value of the saprobity index, the reservoir belonged to the beta-mesosaprobic zone in most cases. The values of biotic indices, high quantitative indicators of zooplankton characterize the Lake Beloye as eutrophic. The analysis of the ecological state of the lake and its coastal territory showed that the main problems are the intake of suspended solids, the compounds of nutrients and pollutants with tributary water, as well as an intensive recreational load, leading to land litter, trampling of vegetation, and lake pollution. In accordance with the environmental problems and ecological restrictions of the territories, they developed the recommendations to reduce the anthropogenic load and project proposals, including the creation and arrangement of a recreation area. Prior to the commencement of improvement, it is recommended to carry out restoration measures, such as aeration of the reservoir, mechanical collection and mowing of plants, cleaning of coastal territory and the lake itself, installation of information signs.

J	Maxwell, AL				Maxwell, AL			Fire regimes in north-eastern Cambodian monsoonal forests, with a 9300-year sediment charcoal record	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To provide insights concerning changes in fire regime in north-eastern Cambodia over the course of the Holocene, and discuss implications of these long-term data for fire management in the present day. Location Southern Ratanakiri Province, north-eastern Cambodia. The lake sites sampled here are embedded in a mosaic of mostly open, strongly deciduous dipterocarp forest, with patches of riparian, semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. Methods Background information on the environmental and cultural setting comes from informal and semi-structured interviews of local villagers to determine present-day burning patterns and customs. Primary data come from analysis of changes in charcoal concentration within sediments from small, closed basin lakes. Charcoal data are compared with changes in pollen and sediment physical characteristics, and to present-day local customs, to infer or speculate on changes in human use of fire. Results Interviews with local people reveal two general types of human-induced fires, one type for swidden cultivation in denser forests, the other type for clearance of ground layer vegetation in more open forests. A 9300-year sediment record of microscopic charcoal deposition shows strongest fire activity ending by 8000 years ago, and the remainder of the early Holocene reflecting a strong summer monsoon and low fire activity. Beginning c. 5500 years ago, forest disturbance and fire activity increased. A subtle change in the record at c. 3500 years ago and more marked change at c. 2500 years ago suggest that fire frequency, and maybe human control over fire, became more important during that period and continuing up to the present. Main conclusions With this type of empirical data from only one site, it is impossible to make accurate conclusions about long-term human impacts from burning. However, this record does show that present-day charcoal input from fire activity is among the lowest for the last 9300 years. Considered together with other changes in the record and with present-day customs, there is a suggestion that anthropogenic fire is an adaptation to the monsoonal environment, and may be conservative of forest cover in open forest formations. This long-term perspective on the role of indigenous land-use customs in landscape evolution should be considered in forest management and biological conservation, as it differs significantly from the traditional rationale for policies of fire suppression in tropical forests.																			0305-0270	1365-2699				FEB	2004	31	2					225	239		10.1046/j.0305-0270.2003.01015.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0305-0270.2003.01015.x													WOS:000188864500004
J	Bechtel, A; Schubert, CJ				Bechtel, Achim; Schubert, Carsten J.			A biogeochemical study of sediments from the eutrophic Lake Lugano and the oligotrophic Lake Brienz, Switzerland	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The biomarker composition and stable isotope (C, O) ratio values of organic matter (OM) and carbonate from sediment cores from the oligotrophic Lake Brienz and the eutrophic Lake Lugano (both in Switzerland) are compared, in order to obtain information about OM sources and transformation processes. Eutrophic conditions at Lake Lugano are reflected in elevated total organic carbon (TOC) content and hydrogen index (HI) values, as well as higher lipid concentrations. Parallel down core trends in delta C-13 values of TOC and calcite in the Lake Lugano sediments reflect bioproductivity cycles. Variations in delta O-18 values of calcite are consistent with changes in mean summer temperature over the time interval covered by the core. In contrast, such a correlation does not exist for Lake Brienz and there the stable isotope composition of calcite reflects its allochthonous origin. In the sediments of both lakes, fatty acid (FA) distributions and the composition of n-alkanols and n-alkanes indicate highly variable proportions of autochthonous OM sources (algae, zooplankton, bacteria) and OM from land plants. Enhanced in situ microbial synthesis during sediment deposition in Lake Lugano is suggested by the higher TOC-normalised concentrations of branched chain FAs (C-15-C-17), hopanoic acids and triterpenoid alcohols (i.e. tetrahymanol, diplopterol). Variations in the concentrations of cholesterol are related to contributions from zooplankton and/or green algae, while sitosterol concentrations reflect the input of vascular plants. Periods of increased input of OM from diatoms are evidenced by high 24-methylcholesta-5,22-dien-3 beta-ol (either epibrassicasterol or brassicasterol) and/or highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes concentrations. High relative concentrations of diplopterol in Lake Lugano sediments are consistent with the predominance of cyanobacteria commonly observed in eutrophic lakes. The presence of archeol and hydroxyarcheol in very low concentrations in the Lugano sediments argues for the activity of methanogens and/or anaerobic methanotrophs. Differences in OM degradation processes are reflected in higher chlorin index values in the Brienz sediments but higher saturated vs. unsaturated n-FAs in the core from Lugano. Higher concentrations of branched chain FAs and 16: 1 omega 7 n-FA, as well as enhanced 18:1 omega 7/18: 1 omega 9 n-FA, are consistent with enhanced bacterial biomass in the Lugano water column or sediments. The preservation of phytol seems to be enhanced in sediments with a high relative contribution of land plant OM. Major factors affecting OM accumulation in the lakes are differences in OM sources (i.e. terrestrial OM vs. autochthonous production), extent of bacterial activity and most likely oxygen availability in the water column.

J	LaPerriere, JD; Jones, JR; Swanson, DK				LaPerriere, JD; Jones, JR; Swanson, DK			Limnology of Lakes in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Alaska	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Limnological reconnaissance data were collected during summers 1992-93 and 1995 from 16 major lakes within Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Alaska (GAAR) located above the Arctic Circle. In GAAR the southern lakes (similar to67degreesN) and those in the Brooks Range foothills are in watersheds with taiga and tundra vegetation. The northern lakes (similar to68degreesN) are at higher elevations in the Brooks Range in watersheds that lie wholly beyond the treeline. Average sum of the cations for all takes matches the world average for fresh waters and the average for drainage from tundra and taiga landscapes. Local lithography explains the measured decrease in calcium equivalents and silica, and an increase in magnesium with altitude because of more calcareous rock in the southern basins at low altitude and shale/conglomerate in northern mountain catchments. In most low altitude takes Secchi depth was located in sub-surface algal peaks at temperatures averaging similar to8.5 C cooler than the surface, typically with double the surface chlorophyll value. Mineral turbidity, and less so color, controlled transparency in several high altitude lakes where turbid inflows were a factor. Lakes were oligotrophic based on nutrients and algal chlorophyll, but a doubling of TP and concurrent halving of TN was measured in GAAR lakes with altitude. Both patterns were correlated with the decreasing density of terrestrial vegetation with altitude, resulting in a sharp decline in the TN:TP ratio. This pattern suggests sources of these nutrients change across the landscape continuum within GAAR described by altitude and vegetation zones. Nitrogen fixation associated with terrestrial vegetation most likely accounts for greater TN in lakes within the taiga and moist or wet tundra, whereas TN levels approximated the N content of regional rainfall in high elevation lakes with predominately barren land and prostrate shrub in the catchments. Ratios of TN:TP and Nutrient Stimulation Bioassays suggest P limitation was likely among low altitude lakes and N limitation increased in importance in takes at high altitude. The particulate composition ratio (as C:N:P molar ratio) of these lakes averaged similar to200:20:1.																			1040-2381					JUN	2003	19	2					108	121		10.1080/07438140309354077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354077													WOS:000184887600003

A multi-proxy approach to reconstruct hydrological changes and Holocene climate development of Nam Co, Central Tibet	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Holocene lake level fluctuations were reconstructed from a 2.7-m sediment core from Nam Co, Central Tibet, China dating to > 7.2 cal ka BP. Results were compared to existing lake records from the Tibetan Plateau to infer variations in the strength of the Asian Monsoon. Geomorphological features in the Nam Co catchment, such as beach ridges and lake terraces, indicate high lake stands during the late Glacial. A major low stand is suggested for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Sands and sandy silts at the base of the core are transgressive facies, with material transported by melt water and deposited under rising lake level conditions that followed the LGM low stand. Variations in grain size, major elements, biomarker stable isotopes and minerals in the core suggest a climate evolution reflected in at least five depositional units and subunits. Sediments in Unit I (similar to 7.2 to similar to 5.4 cal ka BP) were deposited at highest lake levels. Large amounts of allogenic minerals and allochthonous organic matter suggest high precipitation and melt water input, implying positive water balance. Increasing aquatic productivity points to favourable environmental conditions. Unit II (similar to 5.4 to similar to 4.0 cal ka BP) marks a transition between favourable, stable hydrological conditions and lake level decrease. Lower lake levels were a consequence of drier climate with less monsoonal precipitation, higher evaporation rates, and increased moisture recycling in the catchment. Unit III (similar to 4.0 to similar to 1.4 cal ka BP) reflects the driest periods recorded, at similar to 3.7 cal ka BP and 1.6 cal ka BP. Lake shrinkage and salinization was interrupted as suggested by the deposition of Unit IV (similar to 1.4 to similar to 0.8 cal ka BP), when increased precipitation and runoff that might be related to the Medieval Warm Period, led to a stable, but still low lake level. Unit V (800 cal years BP-present) is characterized by progressive lake shrinkage due to intense evaporation. Large fluctuations in geochemical variables indicate humid and arid periods, respectively, at Nam Co between similar to 450 and similar to 200 cal years BP, with the latter assumed to correspond to the Little Ice Age. Modern hydrological data indicate the lake level is rising. Comparison of the Nam Co record with other lake records from the Tibetan Plateau suggests general agreement with the broader picture of Holocene environmental evolution. The timing of dry and wet climate conditions at lake sites across Tibet indicates a gradually decreasing influence of the southern monsoon during the Holocene, from NW to SE. Nevertheless, further research is needed to improve our understanding of Holocene spatio-temporal hydrological variations across the Asian continent.

Wastes from steel-making frequently fall into this category, and there are numerous steel plants, and allied industries, operating around the world producing large quantities of such waste. Many of the waste slurries from the steel industry are characterized by their low solids content (< 25% solids by weight), high iron content (> 50% Fe), high content of magnetic material (> 50% Fe3O4), and fine particle size (< 25 mu m). These properties often preclude effective dewatering, which is necessary to reduce the volume of the waste materials for disposal or recycling. In addition, an effective dewatering process can produce a solids-free liquid product, which can be recycled or discarded as non-hazardous stream. This paper deals with the development of a novel process for dewatering waste pulps containing fine, magnetic material. The process involves chemical flocculation in a magnetic field and the application of a vacuum to remove the water from the flocced pulp producing a filter cake and a filtrate. The patented technique of multi-force dewatering has been implemented through the construction of a novel piece of equipment, consisting of a vacuum drum filter fitted with an internal, fixed magnet. A rare earth magnet fabricated by Eriez Magnetics of Erie, PA, has been incorporated into a laboratory vacuum drum filter by WesTech Engineering Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT. The paper describes the results of multi-force dewatering tests using artificial magnetic mineral pulps and actual steel plant wastes. It has been shown that the application of a magnetic field significantly alters the filtration mechanisms for pulps containing magnetic particles. The filter cake appears to be kept open, possibly due to the formation of channels resulting from the alignment of magnetic particles along the lines of magnetic force. This permits a thick filter cake to be formed while maintaining filtrate flow through the bed. The overall result of the multi-force filtering is a large increase in filtration capacity.																			0892-6875					JAN-FEB	1995	8	1-2					191	200		10.1016/0892-6875(94)00113-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0892-6875(94)00113-Q													WOS:A1995QE61300017
J	Saban, C; Gavin, DG				Saban, Chantel; Gavin, Daniel G.			Reconstruction of Holocene aridity, fire, and vegetation patterns using lake sediments from Dog Lake, Oregon, USA	HOLOCENE												The Holocene history of vegetation and fire in the northern Great Basin (USA) is poorly understood, especially concerning forest-steppe ecotones. Dog Lake is a rare perennial freshwater landslide-dammed lake located near the lower elevation of conifer forests. The lake has a maximum water depth of 8 m which often lowers by several meters during late summer. A 13 m, 9600-yr sediment core revealed periods of increased aridity from indicators of lake levels (aquatic macrophytes, elemental analysis of carbon and nitrogen, and sediment composition), vegetation change (pollen assemblages) and fire (macroscopic charcoal). From 9200 to 8700 cal yr BP, 122 cm of dense Chara matting indicates that lake levels were periodically lower than ca. 3 m. From 8700 to 8200 cal yr BP, high detrital silt input and lower C:N suggests high levels of regional dust and/or erosion, consistent with increased drought, reduced terrestrial plant cover, and dust-fertilized aquatic productivity. Fire activity was also low between 8700 and 8200 cal yr BP, consistent with limited herbaceous fuel availability. Following 8200 cal yr BP, silt levels declined, and pollen assemblages show vegetation trending toward mesic conditions. Deposition of 12 cm of Mazama tephra had no discernable effect on vegetation or fire. Fires increased during the mid-Holocene between 6000 and 4000 cal yr BP during higher grass cover, consistent with cooler conditions relaxing fuel limitation on the fire regime. Vegetation changed little during the late Holocene, with Cupressaceae increasing at 5400 cal yr BP through to current day, and Pinus fluctuating, peaking at 800 cal yr BP and declining through to current day. Our findings matched other regional paleodrought studies and reveals the millennial-scale pattern of climate and fuel limitation on the fire regime at lower treeline.

Slip along the Sultanhani Fault in Central Anatolia from deformed Pleistocene shorelines of palaeo-lake Konya and implications for seismic hazards in low-strain regions	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Central Anatolia is a low-relief, high-elevation region where decadal-scale deformation rates estimated from space geodesy suggest low strain rates within a stiff microplate. However, numerous Quaternary faults have been mapped within this low-strain region and estimating their slip rate and seismic potential is important for hazard assessments in an area of increasing infrastructural development. Here we focus on the Sultanhani Fault (SF), which constitutes an integral part of the Eskisehir-Cihanbeyli Fault System, and use deformed maximum highstand shorelines of palaeo-lake Konya to estimate tectonic slip rates at millennial scale. Some of these shorelines were previously interpreted as fault scarps, but we provide conclusive evidence for their erosional origin. We found that shoreline-angle elevations estimated from differential GPS profiles record vertical displacements of 10.2 m across the SF. New radiocarbon ages of lacustrine molluscs suggest 22.4 m of relative lake-level fall between 22.1 +/- 0.3 and 21.7 +/- 0.4 cal. kaBP, constraining the timing of abrupt abandonment of the highstand shoreline. Models of lithospheric rebound associated with regressions of the Tuz Golu and Konya palaeolakes predict only similar to 1 m of regional-scale uplift across the Konya Basin. Dislocation models of displaced shorelines suggest fault-slip rates of 1.5 and 1.8 mm yr(-1) for planar and listric fault geometries, respectively, providing reasonable results for the latter. We found fault scarps in the Nasuhpinar mudflat that likely represent the most recent ground-breaking rupture of the SF, with an average vertical displacement of 1.2 +/- 0.5 m estimated from 54 topographic profiles, equivalent to a M similar to 6.5-6.9 earthquake based on empirical scaling laws. If such events were characteristic during the ultimate 21 ka, a relatively short recurrence time of similar to 800-900 yr would be needed to account for the millennial slip rate. Alternatively, the fault scarp at Nasuhpinar might represent a larger earthquake requiring more frequent smaller events to account for the millennial rate. The relatively fast slip rate of the SF over the past 21 ka is unlikely to have persisted over longer timescales and might reflect spatiotemporal variations in deformation rates within kinematically-linked fault systems within Central Anatolia, or a transient perturbation to the local stress field or fault strength. Such perturbation might have been related to climatically controlled changes in surface and near-surface loads and by interactions among the different tectonic processes that have been proposed to drive the overall slow uplift and associated extension in the Central Anatolian Plateau.

J	Nedzarek, A; Budzynski, M				Nedzarek, Arkadiusz; Budzynski, Michal			Trophic Status of Lake Niesłysz (Poland) and Related Factors	WATER												In order to ensure the protection of lakes against eutrophication, an ongoing global problem, its causes should be determined on an individual basis. In this study, we investigated Lake Nies & lstrok;ysz in northwestern Poland in terms of (i) the impact of nitrogen and phosphorus on primary production, (ii) the Trophic State Index (TSI), and (iii) the hydromorphological characteristics and watershed features. We determined the thermal conditions, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, and selected forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. TSI was determined using Secchi depth (SD), chlorophyll a, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN). Hypolimnetic anoxia was observed in summer. Surface concentrations of chlorophyll a and organic carbon, total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), and total reactive phosphorus (TRP) were 5 mu g L-1, 11.7 mg C L-1, 0.049 mg N L-1, and 0.018 mg P L-1, respectively. The TN:TP ratio was >30, while TIN:TRP was <10. The TSIs for chlorophyll a, SD, and TP ranged from 42 to 59, and for TN it was >145. The total trophic state index (T-TSI) exceeded 72. In conclusion, Lake Nies & lstrok;ysz has an average resistance to degradation and the catchment has little influence on the release and transport of biogenic matter into the lake. The limiting nutrient for primary production was phosphorus, but the influence of nitrogen or covariates of nitrogen cannot be excluded. Based on the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion, the lake should be classified as eutrophic. Most of the TSIs were in the mesotrophic range, while the TSIs for TN and T-TSI classified the lake as hypertonic. The results show that Lake Nies & lstrok;ysz is currently at a critical stage of progressive degradation, and it is advisable to develop and implement protective measures immediately.

The effect of climate change on Galaxias maculatus thermal habitat availability in northern Andean Patagonian lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Temperature is a prime driver of biological systems, and has implications for populations, community dynamics and stability across entire lake food webs. Galaxias maculatus is a keystone prey species in Patagonian lakes due to its trophic and habitat coupling roles. Adverse effects on this species could cascade through food webs, threatening the biotic integrity of Patagonian lakes. Our aim was to define the current use of available thermal habitats by three G. maculatus life stages in three morphologically dissimilar lakes of the Andean range and to simulate potential shifts in thermal habitat availability. Thermal habitat availability simulations derived for the 4.5- and 8.5-W/m(2) radiative forcing values of greenhouse gas Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios up to 2099 were run for the three lakes. The availability of simulated thermal habitats for 2099 was used to analyse possible consequences for G. maculatus, using thermal habitat suitability index curves. The curves were defined from the temperature dependence of the maximum consumption of each life stage of G. maculatus considered. Our results showed that thermoclines would form at greater depths in the two deep lakes and remain stable for longer periods than at present. For the shallow lake, which does not currently form a thermocline, Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios predict higher water temperatures and absence of winter freezing. Galaxias maculatus currently encounters better thermal habitat for food consumption in the shallow than the deep lakes. Simulations for the deep lakes indicated that future climate change will not be detrimental to any G. maculatus life stage. However, in shallow lakes its earlier life stages will encounter lower quality thermal conditions. Lower quality thermal conditions in shallow lakes could result in a reduction in G. maculatus numbers, which could affect entire food webs given that this species is a keystone prey species. In turn, this could threaten the biotic integrity of these lakes. Our results raise the question: what happens in other lakes around the world that have low food web complexity, dynamic processes, and structure, which depend on a single vulnerable keystone prey species? The lack of research addressing the role of keystone species in relation to global climate change suggests that this question has not been thoroughly addressed and requires further study around the world.

The usefulness of traditional optical images highly depends on cloudless weather conditions and suitable solar illumination, while lake area detection procedures in optical images might be prevented by the presence of shadows, variations in solar illumination, and geometric distortions. In contrast, SAR imagery has its advantage of relative insensitivity to atmospheric conditions and independence from sun illumination. In this work, high-resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight mode images are utilized to monitor area fluctuation in Namco. As narrow observation area is the expense of high resolution in SAR imaging, scene size of TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight mode is only 5km * 10km (Azimuth* Range). Therefore, for a great lake around 2000 km(2) such as Namco, the selection of observation position is very important for assessing the resolution accuracy. Based on the lake bathymetric survey data, the northeast corner of Namco is chosen as the observation area, as the most obvious water level fluctuations is located in this part. To quantitative calculation the water area of lake from temporal SAR images, A four-step approach is proposed: 1) Orthorectification and Data Coregistration; 2) Speckle Filtering; 3) Segmentation of SAR Image; 4) Water Area Detection and Calculation. The quantitative analysis of the water area, which is calculated utilizing the corresponding technique mentioned above, are 32982205, and 33253869 m(2) in July 11, 2014 and August 2, 2014, respectively. The largest area change part is located in the valley region, with lake area increasing by 79824 m(2). In accordance with prior investigation and meteorological data set, the average precipitation, glacial meltwater supply, as well as runoff reaches the maximum of the whole year in the duration from June to September on Tibet Plateau. Thus it is easy to understand the extensive tendency of the lake.

J	Raun, AL; Borum, J; Sand-Jensen, K				Raun, Ane Lovendahl; Borum, Jens; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			Influence of sediment organic enrichment and water alkalinity on growth of aquatic isoetid and elodeid plants	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Lake eutrophication has increased phytoplankton blooms and sediment organic matter. Among higher plants, small, oligotrophic rosette species (isoetids) have disappeared, while a few tall, eutrophic species (elodeids) may have persisted. Despite recent reduction of nutrient loading in restored lakes, the vegetation has rarely regained its former composition and coverage. Patterns of recovery may depend on local alkalinity because HCO(3)- stimulates photosynthesis of elodeids and not of isoetids. In laboratory growth experiments with two isoetids (Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora) and two elodeids (Potamogeton crispus and P. perfoliatus), we test whether organic enrichment of lake sediments has a long-lasting influence by: (i) reducing plant growth because of oxygen stress on plant roots and (ii) inhibiting growth more for isoetids than elodeids. We also test whether (iii) increasing alkalinity (from 0.17 to 3.20 meq. L-1) enhances growth and reduces inhibition of organic sediment enrichment for elodeids but not for isoetids. 2. In low organic sediments, higher oxygen release from roots of isoetids than elodeids generated oxic conditions to greater sediment depth for Lobelia (4.3 cm) and Littorella (3.0 cm) than for Potamogeton species (1.6-2.2 cm). Sediment oxygen penetration depth fell rapidly to 0.4-1.0 cm for all four species at even modest organic enrichment and oxygen consumption in the sediments. Roots became shorter and isoetid roots became thicker to better supply oxygen to apical meristems. 3. Growth of elodeids was strongly inhibited across all levels of organic enrichment of sediments being eight-fold lower at the highest enrichment compared to the unenriched control. Leaf biomass of isoetids increased three-fold by moderate organic enrichment presumably because of greater CO(2) supply from sediments being their main CO(2) source. At higher organic enrichment, isoetid biomass was reduced, leaf chlorophyll declined up to 10-fold, root length declined from 7 to < 2 cm and mortality rose (up to 50%) signalling high plant stress. 4. Lobelia was not affected by HCO(3)- addition in accordance with its use of sediment CO(2). Biomass of elodeids increased severalfold by rising alkalinity from 0.17 to 3.20 meq. L-1 in accordance with their use of HCO(3)- for photosynthesis, while the negative impact of organically enriched sediments remained. 5. Overall, root development of all four species was so strongly restricted in sediments enriched with labile organic matter that plants if growing in situ may lose root anchorage. Other experiments demonstrate that this risk is enhanced by greater water content and reduced consolidation in organically rich sediments. Therefore, formation of more muddy and oxygen-demanding sediments during eutrophication will impede plant recovery in restored lakes while high local alkalinity will help elodeid recovery.

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR FRESHWATER MUSSEL REPRODUCTION AND POSSIBLE APPLICATION FOR EXTENSIVE REARING IN ITALY	JOURNAL OF CONCHOLOGY												The present work is aimed to investigate the physiology of reproduction Of the freshwater mussel (Anodonta anatina) for future extensive farming. In this paper the knowledge of life history traits and reproductive aspects is considered as the first step for obtaining juveniles for rearing mussels in captivity. In the first part of this research 2,285 specimens of A. anatina were placed in 5 sites hi the Avigliana Lakes (NW Italy) and reared for a 2 years period, A sample of 180 specimens was collected in the Lake in November 2003 and 57% of mussels were gravid. The brooding period started from late August to the next spring. Histology performed on 11 individuals collected in April and late June 2004 clearly showed either females or hermaphrodites, confirming that A. anatina sexual strategy is characterised by a high plasticity. In order to obtain juveniles in captivity, a correct assessment of glochidial maturity Was necessary. In April hooks of glochidia were completely developed and the adductor muscle was clearly visible. A partial extrusion of the mantle before glochidial release can be considered a good indicator of glochidial maturity, while water temperature and glochidial snapping activity are less reliable. Four Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), 8 Bleaks (Alburnus alburnus) and an European Perch (Perca fluviatilis), were infested with glochidia in aquarium, confirming that A. anatina is a low selective host fish species and that host fish parasitism can be easily performed in artificial conditions with fish species commonly found in Avigliana Lakes. A cast of direct development to a juvenile A. anatina without the parasitic stage on fish was also observed: a metamorphosed glochidium (juvenile) was found in the genital duct together with sub-triangular glochidia of smaller size. This is the first observation of direct development reported for an European unionid. Freshwater mussel farming could be interesting activity for the future for bacteria filtration in integrate productions and as alternative feedstuffs for farmed fish nutrition. This preliminary Work is the first step for larval rearing and potential future European freshwater mussel farming.

J	Edwards, ME; Mock, CJ; Finney, BP; Barber, VA; Bartlein, PJ				Edwards, ME; Mock, CJ; Finney, BP; Barber, VA; Bartlein, PJ			Potential analogues for paleoclimatic variations in eastern interior Alaska during the past 14,000 yr: atmospheric-circulation controls of regional temperature and moisture responses	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Beringian Paleoenvironments Workshop	1997	BERINGIA, RUSSIA					The paleoclimatic history of a region can be viewed as a series of surface temperature and moisture anomalies through time. The effects of changes in large-scale climatic controls (e.g., insolation, major circulation controls) can be mediated by the influence of smaller-scale controls (e.g., topographic barriers, coastlines); this may result in heterogenous surface climatic responses at the regional and sub-regional scale. Divergent paleoclimatic trajectories between regions may be explainable in terms of such meso-scale patterns. Using modern analogues for paleoclimate we examine how the sequence of climatic variations in eastern interior Alaska during the interval 12,000-0 C-14 yr BP could have been generated by specific atmospheric circulation patterns. Fossil-pollen and lake-level records document the long-term trends in temperature and effective moisture for the region. Water-balance modelling provides additional estimates of paleoprecipitation. Synoptic climatological patterns are described using the modern (instrumental) record of upper-level and sea-level pressure, surface temperature, and precipitation. At 12,000 C-14 yr BP, eastern interior Alaska was cooler and drier than present, a situation generated today by a southward displacement of the jet stream. Conditions warmer and drier than present at 9000 C-14 yr BP may have been generated by increased ridging north of Alaska and a weakened westerly circulation. Warmer, wetter conditions than present possibly prevailed in the late-middle Holocene; these might reflect ridging over Alaska and troughing further west. Cool, wet conditions feature enhanced westerly flow into Alaska through an eastward shift in the east Asian trough and positive pressure anomalies in the North Pacific; they may be analogous to cold periods of the Little Ice Age. The analogues demonstrate how surface conditions in other parts of Beringia may sometimes be similar to, while at other times different from those in the eastern interior. These broader spatial patterns provide hypotheses about past climates that can be tested with paleoclimatological data. For example, the widespread positive temperature anomalies associated with the warm/dry (9000 C-14 yr BP) analogue fit with the expansion northward of the eastern Siberian treeline. The anomalously cool conditions in northeast Siberia associated with the warm/wet analogue may explain the continued (late-middle Holocene) treeline advance in Alaska while there was retreat in Siberia.

J	Kim, H; Chung, Y				Kim, H; Chung, Y			On surface O3 associated with long-range transport in the Yellow Sea region	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Measurements of surface ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were conducted at Tae-ahn (TAP) and Chongwon (CHN) on the Korean Peninsula, during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment-Asian Pacific region (ACE-Asia) campaign, March-May 2001. The measurements provide ground-based data at a western remote site of south Korea and characterize the long-range transport of O-3 over the Yellow Sea region during spring. The mean values of O-3 and NO2 concentration at TAP were 42 ppb and 12 ppb, respectively. The average O-3 diurnal variation of 17 ppb at TAP indicates that the loss of O-3 was not pronounced during the night. The highest NO2 concentrations, with an average diurnal variation of 8 ppb, occurred in the afternoon at 13-15 LST. The day-to-day variation of daily O-3 concentrations at TAP is strongly influenced by the movement of synoptic scale weather patterns. In general, the O-3 concentration in a southwesterly airflow tended to increase when a moving anticyclone crossed the site, ahead of a cold front. By contrast, north-northwesterly airflows associated with the passage of a cold front bring fresh continental outflow and decrease O-3 concentrations. Surface O-3 data at TAP were classified utilizing backward trajectory analysis based on the residence time, as well as the path of the airflows, in the boundary layer (1500 m asl) over the Yellow Sea region. The results show that north-northwest continental airflows, that were transported around Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia at an altitude of approximately 3 km at relatively high speed and came straight down at TAP, represent continental background O-3 concentrations with a mean value of 29 ppb for this period. These airflows have a short period of residence of less than one day in the boundary layer over the Yellow Sea region. In contrast, the mean O-3 value of 45 ppb was observed in regionally polluted airflows mainly passing through the east-southeast part of China and remaining for 3 days, on average, in the Yellow Sea region. These three days residence time of the regionally polluted airflows over the Yellow Sea region allowed sufficient time for photochemical O-3 formation.

Twenty-five hundred years later, after a massive regression, a new transgressive phase, produced paleolake Coipasa, smaller than Tauca and restricted to the southern part of the basin. These paleolakes were overlooked at the west by the Sajama ice cap. The latter provides a continuous record of the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-precipitation for the last 25 ka. Contemporaneously to the end of paleolake Tauca, around 14.3 ka, the Sajama ice cap recorded a significant increase in ice oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18(ice)). This paper examines to what extent the disappearance of Lake Tauca contributed to precipitation on the Sajama summit and this specific isotopic variation. The water delta O-18 values of paleolakes Tauca and Coipasa (delta O-18(lake)) were quantitatively reconstructed from 18.5 to 11.7 ka based on diatom isotopic composition (delta O-18(diatoms)) and ostracod isotopic composition (delta O-18(carbonates)) retrieved in lacustrine sediments. At a centennial time scale, a strong trend appears: abrupt decreases of delta O-18(lake) during lake fillings are immediately followed by abrupt increases of delta O-18(lake) during lake level stable phases. The highest variation occurred at similar to 15.8 ka with a delta O-18(lake) decrease of about similar to 10%o, concomitant with the Lake Tauca highstand, followed similar to 400 years later by a 7 parts per thousand increase in delta O-18(lake). A simple hydro-isotopic modeling approach reproduces consistently this rapid "decrease-increase" feature. Moreover, it suggests that this unexpected re-increase in delta O-18(lake) after filling phases can be partly explained by an equilibration of isotopic fluxes during the lake steady-state. Based on isotopic calculations during lake evaporation and a simple water stable isotopes balance between potential moisture sources at Sajama (advection versus lake evaporation), we show that total or partial evaporation (from 5 to 60%) of paleolake Tauca during its major regression phase at 14.3 ka could explain the pronounced isotopic excursion at Sajama ice cap. These results suggest that perturbations of the local hydrological cycle in lacustrine areas may substantially affect the paleoclimatic interpretation of the near-by isotopic signals (e.g. ice core or speleothems).

Still, very little is known about its injury profile. Purpose: To analyze the incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors for SUP-related injuries in mainly calm waters and the use of safety equipment. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: The authors distributed an online survey that gathered information on characteristics, injury history over the past 12 months, use of (safety) equipment, and health issues of SUP riders in German-speaking countries. Results: A total of 438 participants completed the survey. The mean participant age was 45 years (range, 8-82 years), 48% were female athletes, and 19.6% took part in competitions. Over the past 12 months, 72 (17%) of 431 respondents experienced a SUP-related injury, resulting in an overall incidence rate (IR) of 1.95 injuries per 1000 hours of activity. Male competitive athletes using a hardboard had the highest risk of injury. The IR for competitive riders was higher (3.21 injuries per 1000 hours) than that for recreational riders (1.41 injuries per 1000 hours). Mechanisms of injury were overuse (n = 29) and contact with the board (n = 18) or ground (n = 12). Injuries affected mainly muscles/tendons and joints of the upper arm/shoulder (n = 20), followed by wrist/hand (n = 18), knee (n = 16), elbow/forearm (n = 12), and foot (n = 11). The highest risk of injury occurred when paddling in wild water (33.3%), followed by SUP surfing (29.4%), and the lowest risk occurred while paddling on a lake (16.1%). A life vest was always used by 27, depending on the situation by 201, and never by 202 participants; a leash was always used by 161, depending on the situation by 244, and never by 26 participants. Of the 272 participants who paddled in winter, 253 wore a drysuit or wetsuit, whereas 19 paddled without any special clothing. Conclusion: SUP-related injuries predominantly happened in wild water or while SUP surfing, and male competitive athletes using a hardboard had the highest risk of injury. The main mechanisms of injury were overuse and hitting the board or ground. The upper extremity was more prone to injury, followed by the knee and foot. More effort should be made to educate paddlers on the necessity and correct use of the life vest, leash, and specialized outfits.

J	BERGER, GW; BUSACCA, AJ				BERGER, GW; BUSACCA, AJ			THERMOLUMINESCENCE DATING OF LATE PLEISTOCENE LOESS AND TEPHRA FROM EASTERN WASHINGTON AND SOUTHERN OREGON AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ERUPTIVE HISTORY OF MOUNT ST-HELENS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The first numeric dating of late Pleistocene loess from the Palouse region of eastern Washington is reported. This loess is interbedded with thin, distal tephra layers, some identified as Mount St. Helens products. Both the interbedded tephra layers and thick paleosols that have developed in the loess have previously been correlated across the region. A thicker correlative of one of these tephra layers (Mount St. Helens set C) was collected from Summer Lake, Oregon, for direct dating by thermoluminescence (TL). Polymineral, fine grain TL ages for loess from three chosen sections in Washington range from 17 to 83 ka. These imply ages for some tephra beds that are significantly older than implied by earlier radiocarbon (C-14) dating. For example, TL ages of 17-21 ka for loess bracketing a tephra layer correlated to Mount St. Helens set S suggests a somewhat older age for this ash than the previously accepted C-14 age of similar to 15.5 +/- 0.5 ka cal yr (corrected to calendar years). TL ages of 46 +/- 6 (1 sigma) ka and 57 +/- 7 ka for loess above, and of 53 +/- 7 ka and <75 +/- 6 ka below a tephra bed correlated to a Mount St. Helens set Cw layer, along with a TL age of 46 +/- 5 ka for fine-silt-sized glass from a Mount St. Helens set Cy bed in Oregon, revise upward from similar to 38 ka cal yr (C-14 age is similar to 36 ka B.P.) to similar to 50 ka the age of this regionally important marker ash set. Several TL ages, taken together, imply a much longer eruptive history for Mount St. Helens than previously thought. A TL age of 83 +/- 8 ka just below a previously undated tephra layer from Mount St. Helens (EMSH ash) suggests that the eruptive history of the mountain extends back to at least 80 ka. Furthermore, age depth extrapolation through our sections to an ash (WA-5C) probably correlated to Mount St. Helens suggests an eruptive history of at least 120 ka.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				NOV 10	1995	100	B11					22361	22374		10.1029/95JB01686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JB01686													WOS:A1995TE22500024

Regional reconstruction of subglacial hydrology and glaciodynamic behaviour along the southern margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in British Columbia, Canada and northern Washington State, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Subglacial landsystems in and around Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, Canada are investigated in order to evaluate landscape development, subglacial hydrology and Cordilleran Ice Sheet dynamics along its southern margin. Major landscape elements include drumlin swarms and tunnel valleys. Drumlins are composed of bedrock, diamicton and glaciofluvial sediments; their form truncates the substrate. Tunnel valleys of various scales (km to 100s km length), incised into bedrock and sediment, exhibit convex longitudinal profiles, and truncate drumlin swarms. Okanagan Valley is the largest tunnel valley in the area and is eroded >300 m below sea level. Over 600 m of Late Wisconsin-age sediments, consisting of a fining-up sequence of cobble gravel, sand and silt fill Okanagan Valley. Landform-substrate relationships, landform associations, and sedimentary sequences are incompatible with prevailing explanations of landsystem development centred mainly on deforming beds. They are best explained by meltwater erosion and deposition during ice sheet underbursts. During the Late-Wisconsin glaciation, Okanagan Valley functioned as part of a subglacial lake spanning multiple connected valleys (few 100s km) of southern British Columbia. Subglacial lake development started either as glaciers advanced over a pre-existing sub-aerial lake (catch lake) or by incremental production and storage of basal meltwater. High geothermal heat flux, geothermal springs and/or subglacial volcanic eruptions contributed to ice melt, and may have triggered, along with priming from supraglacial lakes, subglacial lake drainage. During the underburst(s), sheetflows eroded drumlins in corridors and channelized flows eroded tunnel valleys. Progressive flow channelization focused flows toward major bedrock valleys. In Okanagan Valley, most of the pre-glacial and early-glacial sediment fill was removed. A fining-up sequence of boulder gravel and sand was deposited during waning stages of the underburst(s) and bedrock drumlins in Okanagan Valley were enhanced or wholly formed by this underburst(s). Subglacial lake development and drainage had an impact on ice sheet geometry and ice volumes. The prevailing conceptual model for growth and decay of the CIS suggests significantly thicker ice in valleys compared to plateaus. Subglacial lake development created a reversal of this ice sheet geometry where grounded ice on plateaus thickened while floating valley ice remained thinner (due to melting and enhanced sliding, with significant transfer of ice toward the ice sheet margin). Subglacial lake drainage may have hastened deglaciation by melting ice, lowering ice-surface elevations, and causing lid fracture. This paper highlights the importance of ice sheet hydrology: its control on ice flow dynamics, distribution and volume in continental ice masses. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jellyman, DJ; Chisnall, BL				Jellyman, DJ; Chisnall, BL			Habitat preferences of shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis), in two New Zealand lowland lakes	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The habitats used by shortfinned eels (Anguilla australis (Richardson)) in Lakes Ellesmere (Canterbury) and Waahi (Waikato), New Zealand, were determined using a variety of capture techniques during the summers of 1994/95-1997/98. The most successful technique used to catch juvenile eels (<300 mm total length (TL)) in Lake Ellesmere was a 2-m wide beam trawl; larger eels were captured mainly by fine-meshed fyke nets. Trawl catches during the night exceeded catches during the day by a factor of 2.4. In Lake Ellesmere, juvenile eels were mainly caught in the depth range 0.6-1.2 m, on a gravel and/or mud substrate, and within 1 km of the shore. In contrast, larger eels (greater than or equal to 300 mm) preferred sandy substrates, but showed no marked preference for particular depths or distances offshore. The spatial distribution of both size groups was non-random. Although water temperature did not influence catch rates (CPUE, catch-per-unit-effort) of either size group, catches of the smaller eels were greater during the new moon phase than during the other phases-catches of larger eels were unaffected by lunar phase. Length-frequency distributions of eels from Lake Ellesmere were strongly bimodal, with eels 200-300 mm poorly represented-this probably reflects poor recruitment for several years, either because lake opening times did not coincide with the availability of glass eels, or because overall numbers of glass eels were low.;Juvenile eels in Lake Waahi, caught in fine-meshed fyke nets and in special brush collectors, were also inshore residents; unlike Lake Ellesmere, juvenile eels could be caught at the lake margins, probably because Lake Waahi is not subject to the same wind-induced water level fluctuations as Lake Ellesmere. Recruitment into Lake Waahi commenced in mid December, but there was evidence of low recruitment in past years for this lake also. An important outcome of this research is that estimates of the number of juvenile eels to be transplanted during stocking programmes should be made using the area of the shallow littoral rather than the area of the whole lake.																			0028-8330					JUN	1999	33	2					233	248		10.1080/00288330.1999.9516873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1999.9516873													WOS:000083585800009
J	Larsen, D; Crossey, LJ				Larsen, D; Crossey, LJ			Depositional environments and paleolimnology of an ancient caldera lake: Oligocene Creede formation, Colorado	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Oligocene Creede Formation represents an exceptionally well-preserved intra-caldera sedimentary sequence within a large, resurgent caldera, The tuffaceous, epiclastic, and limestone deposits observed in surface exposures and Continental Scientific Drilling Program (CSDP) core provide a record of depositional processes and basin evolution following caldera collapse, The basal part of the Creede Formation is characterized by interbedded caldera wall-derived debris-flow breccias and ephemeral lake deposits. This unit is succeeded by deep-water lacustrine beds that constitute the bulk of the Creede Formation, Interbedded fallout tuffs from intracaldera volcanic eruptions significantly affected lacustrine sedimentation patterns and provide a means of basinwide correlation, Prominent sublacustrine travertine accumulations circumscribe the margins of the moat basin and probably outline the structural margin of the caldera. Deposition in a cool, montane climate is indicated by the presence of pseudomorphs after ikaite in the travertine and lake beds, and corroborative paleofloral analyses. Distinctive lowstand (shallow lake) and highstand (deep lake) facies-association distributions were deposited. Changes in the proportion and character of lowstand versus highstand sequences imply an evolution from a narrow, deep, steep-walled basin to a broad, shallow, incised basin through time. Carbonate minerals were deposited in the lake as travertine at spring-orifices, and as suspension-fallout laminae across the bottom, Little evidence for shelly or fish fauna is preserved in the lake beds. The character of the laminated strata and abundance of depositional carbonate suggest that the lake evolved into a permanently stratified, bicarbonate lake, The volume and mineralogy of depositional carbonate changed through time, but evidence for development of hypersaline, alkaline lake-water compositions is not observed. The level of basin-fill and geomorphic considerations preclude control of lake level by a hydrologic sill; thus, the basin hydrology appears to have been controlled through a combination of climate and groundwater seepage. The deposits of the Creede Formation closely resemble those in modern and ancient caldera and crater lake basins. The effects of volcanism on detrital lacustrine sedimentation are profound; however, the influences on lake chemistry and biology are less clear, The extensive travertine in the Creede Formation appears to be related to the volcanic setting, although the origin is as of yet unclear.

Impact of native and non-native aquatic plants on methane emission and phytoplankton growth	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Freshwater plants affect the ecosystem functioning of shallow aquatic ecosystems. However, because native plants are threatened by environmental change such as eutrophication, global warming and biological invasions, continued ecosystem functioning may be at risk. In this study, we explored how the growth of native and non-native plant species in eutrophic, warm conditions impacts two plant ecosystem functions: regulation of phytoplankton growth and methane emission. We expected that plants would inhibit phytoplankton growth, while for methane emission both inhibition and stimulation are possible. We conducted an outdoor experiment using monocultures of four native and four non-native freshwater plant species planted at three different densities, as well as a no-plant control. Monocultures of each species were planted in 65 L mesocosms and after three weeks of acclimatisation each mesocosm was inoculated with phytoplankton. Subsequently, we added nutrients twice a week for eight weeks, before harvesting the plant biomass. During these eight weeks, we measured chlorophyll-a concentration thirteen times and the diffusive methane emissions once after four weeks. The mesocosms amplified the temperature of a warm summer so that plants were exposed to higher-than-average temperatures. We found that five plant species lost biomass, two species increased their biomass only at the highest initial plant density (native Myriophyllum spicatum and non-native Lagarosiphon major) and a single species increased its biomass at all densities (on average 14 times its initial mass; amphibious non-native Myriophyllum aquaticum). Overall, the mean biomass change of non-natives was positive, whereas that of natives was negative. This difference in biomass change between native and non-native plants did not relate to overall differences in phytoplankton mass or diffusive methane emissions. In mesocosms where submerged plant species gained biomass, chlorophyll-a concentration was lower than in the no-plant control and mesocosms with biomass loss. Diffusive methane emissions were highest in mesocosms where plants lost considerable biomass, likely because it increased substrate availability for methanogenesis. However, mesocosms where plant biomass increased had emissions similar to the no-plant control, hence we found no inhibitory effects of plant presence on diffusive methane emission. We conclude that plant growth in eutrophic, warm conditions varies strongly with plant identity. Our results furthermore suggest that plant identity determines whether the replacement of native by non-native freshwater plants will alter ecosystem functions such as regulation of phytoplankton growth and methane emission.

Legacy Phosphorus and Ecosystem Memory Control Future Water Quality in a Eutrophic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake water clarity, phytoplankton biomass, and hypolimnetic oxygen concentration are metrics of water quality that are highly degraded in eutrophic systems. Eutrophication is linked to legacy nutrients stored in catchment soils and in lake sediments. Long lags in water quality improvement under scenarios of nutrient load reduction to lakes indicate an apparent ecosystem memory tied to the interactions between water biogeochemistry and lake sediment nutrients. To investigate how nutrient legacies and ecosystem memory control lake water quality dynamics, we coupled nutrient cycling and lake metabolism in a model to recreate long-term water quality of a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA). We modeled long-term recovery of water quality under scenarios of nutrient load reduction and found that the rates and patterns of water quality improvement depended on changes in phosphorus (P) and organic carbon storage in the water column and sediments. Through scenarios of water quality improvement, we showed that water quality variables have distinct phases of change determined by the turnover rates of storage pools-an initial and rapid water quality improvement due to water column flushing, followed by a much longer and slower improvement as sediment P pools were slowly reduced. Water clarity, phytoplankton biomass, and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen differed in their time responses. Water clarity and algal biomass improved within years of nutrient reductions, but hypolimnetic oxygen took decades to improve. Even with reduced catchment loading, recovery of Lake Mendota to a mesotrophic state may require decades due to nutrient legacies and long ecosystem memory. Lake water quality, as measured by algae concentration near the lake surface, the clarity of the water, and the availability of dissolved oxygen, is greatly reduced in lakes with nutrient pollution from phosphorus. In Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, phosphorus applied to the surrounding landscape for more than a century has accumulated in catchment soils and in the lake water column and sediments (i.e., "legacy phosphorus"), leading to poor water quality. To investigate how water quality in Lake Mendota might respond to nutrient reduction, we used computer models to simulate the elimination of phosphorus inputs from the catchment and track water quality change. Phosphorus in the lake water column initially decreased quickly, due to water column flushing, but then decreased very slowly due to release of legacy phosphorus from lake sediments. Water quality recovery lagged that of phosphorus, indicating an inherent "ecosystem memory" for past phosphorus levels. Ecosystem memory was due to biological activity that remained elevated, even when phosphorus was declining in the water column. When nutrient inputs to the lake were eliminated in the model, recovery of algae concentrations and water clarity to pristine conditions required decades, and a return to a fully oxygenated condition required a century. Legacy phosphorus in lake sediments controls long term lake water quality response to nutrient remediationCoupled cycles of nutrients, physics, and metabolism explain ecosystem memory of lake phosphorus, water clarity, and oxygen habitatImprovement in lake water quality to pristine levels will require decades of commitment to nutrient load reductions					; Albright, Ellen/HTM-7898-2023; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020	Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061; Albright, Ellen/0000-0002-6226-9158													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2023	128	12							e2023JG007620	10.1029/2023JG007620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007620													WOS:001111077500001
J	Csoma, AÉ; Goldstein, RH; Mindszenty, A; Simone, L				Csoma, AÉ; Goldstein, RH; Mindszenty, A; Simone, L			Diagenetic salinity cycles and sea level along a major unconformity, Monte Camposauro, Italy	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												In shallow-water carbonates, position of the water table and the chemistry of early diagenetic fluids are controlled in large part by sea-level and climate fluctuations. These fluctuations may result in cyclic progression from marine diagenesis or sedimentation, to mixing zone, meteoric, mixing zone, and then marine diagenesis or sedimentation. Herein we term such a cyclic progression as a diagenetic salinity cycle. This diagenetic study along a single unconformity in Cretaceous limestones of Monte Camposauro, southern Apennines, Italy, demonstrates the presence of four diagenetic salinity cycles and their link to relative changes in sea level. Data consist of field observations, transmitted light and cathodoluminescence microscopy, fluid inclusions, and carbon and oxygen isotopes. They show that twenty-one unconformity-related diagenetic features predated deposition of marine limestones above the unconformity. Fossiliferous internal sediments and stable-isotope data from radiaxial fibrous calcite and recrystallized aragonite are used to indicate marine diagenesis. Fluid-inclusion and stable-isotope data are used to indicate precipitation of calcite cement in all mixing ratios of the mixing-zone environment and in the freshwater phreatic zone. Paleocave morphology indicates vadose and water-table dissolution, and bauxite sediments support extensive vadose diagenesis. In each diagenetic salinity cycle, there is evidence for relative fall or rise of sea level, indicated by transitions from marine sedimentation to mixing zone and freshwater phreatic diagenesis, marine phreatic to freshwater vadose diagenesis, vadose diagenesis to marine phreatic diagenesis, and freshwater phreatic diagenesis to normal marine sedimentation. During the time interval of the development of the unconformity (beginning some time in the Aptian and ending in the early middle Cenomanian) at least seven third-order eustatic fluctuations have been hypothesized during an overall second-order eustatic rise. At a given elevation, the third-order eustatic fluctuations would not be able to produce four diagenetic salinity cycles without tectonic uplift of 3.5 to 8 mm/ky. Our study illustrates that the formation and the timing of diagenetic salinity cycles are highly sensitive to paleoelevation. Diagenetic salinity cycles, preserved along unconformities, can be used to interpret relative changes of sea level and to predict the presence of depositional sequences in downdip positions. Conversely, downdip depositional sequences, tectonic history, and sea-level history can be used to predict some aspects of diagenetic alteration updip.

J	Yehdegho, B; Probst, G				Yehdegho, B; Probst, G			Chemical mass budget of two dredged lakes embedded in shallow Quaternary aquifers in southern Austria	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Determination of the chemical mass budget is of major importance in evaluating the resulting hydrogeochemical and biochemical changes due to the formation of dredged lakes. This is not only very useful to enable precautionary measures to be taken to protect shallow aquifers from pollution, it also provides a basis fur decisions regarding the location of future projects for sand and gravel mining in shallow groundwater fields. The Schwarzl and the Weizelsdorfer Lakes are typical through-flow systems, whose water and solute budgets are primarily controlled by transient groundwater. Through-flow rates, estimated with the help of stable isotopes, deuterium and oxygen-18, together with the hydrochemical data from 1991 allowed the quantification of the chemical mass budget of the major chemical species within 20-30% of uncertainty. The hydrochemical composition of studied lakes is considerably altered by dilution and in-lake source/sink processes. The dilution effect (due to precipitation falling direct on the surface of the lakes) was approximated at. 26 and 14% of the inputs to the Schwarzl Lake and the Weizelsdorfer Lake respectively, using chloride concentration data. The change in concentration of the major dissolved solutes resulting from in-lake source/sink function (net annual budget - dilution effect) was variable. The general change pattern was a decrease of Na+, Ca2+, HCO3-, NO3- and SiO2 components and an increase in Mg2+, SO42- and K+ concentrations in both lakes. SIcalcite and SIdolomite together with P-CO2 and the evaporative signature on delta H-2 and delta O-18 prove to be very useful tools in determining the impact of dredged lakes on the mixing zones, i.e. in identifying the wells containing lake water and to quantify the mixing ratio. From chemical data, only the wells that contain a large fraction of lake water (> 60-70%) could be identified. This fact emphasizes the advantage of the stable isotopes as conservative tracers over chemical parameters in determining the impact of evaporated lakes on the down-gradient groundwater fields.																			0943-0105					MAY	2001	40	7					809	819																WOS:000168922400002

The diversity of wild trout stocks in Montenegro is compromised by insufficiently controlled stocking. Adriatic and Mediterranean areas show a high degree of endemism of the salmonid species, with numerous native Salmo taxa described. The invasive effect of brown trout, Salmo India Linnaeus, 1758, of the Atlantic haplogroup on the endemic Adriatic trout, Salmo farioides Karaman, 1938, in the drainage area of the Adriatic Sea basin is lower compared to the effect inflicted by S. trutta has on Salmo labrax Pallas, 1814 of the Danubian haplogroup. The presently reported study was intended to describe the genetic structure of the population of Adriatic trout, Salmo farioides, from the Mrtvica River, a right tributary of the Moraca River, Montenegro, in order to get an insight into the spread of non-native strains and their introgression into the native Adriatic trout gene pool. Material and methods. Trout specimens sampled from the lower section of the Mrtvica River from 2004 to 2007, and from its upper section in the spring of 2014, were analysed for their mtDNA haplotypes. Nuclear DNA markers (microsatellites, LDH-C1* gene) were also included in genetic analyses since mtDNA is inherited only maternally. After statistical analyses, relations between individuals from the upper and lower Mrtvica River were reconstructed. Results. Using both LDH-C1* and seven microsatellite loci with several alleles exclusive to S. trutta, an introgression was detected only in the upper reaches of the Mrtvica River, where only stream-dwelling trout form occurs. In the lower reaches no introgression was detected at all, as revealed by the absence of both the Atlantic mitochondrial haplotype and microsatellite alleles exclusive to S. trutta. Conclusion. The allelic frequency at seven microsatellite loci of Salmo spp. from the two river sections revealed very different population structure, as a consequence of a low rate of gene flow between them. In addition to the physical barrier that prevents Salmo sp. from the lower Mrtvica River to migrate to the upper river section, it seems that the opportunity to mate with the large pool of conspecifics, including lake-dwelling S. farioides (i.e., Salmo cf. dentex), prevents Salmo trutta from surviving at the lower reach and spread to the rest of the Morava River and Lake Skadar systems.

J	Irving, E; Baker, J; Hamilton, M; Wynne, PJ				Irving, E; Baker, J; Hamilton, M; Wynne, PJ			Early Proterozoic geomagnetic field in western Laurentia: implications for paleolatitudes, local rotations and stratigraphy	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The east-west trending, post-orogenic subvertical Cleaver Dykes from the Great Bear Magmatic Arc are dated by the U-Pb (baddeleyite) method to be 1740 +5/-4 Ma. They have a mean direction of magnetization of D, I = 136.5 and 57.4degrees, k = 64, alpha(95) = 4.5degrees, based on samples from 17 diabase dykes, a mean location 65.7degreesN, 118.03degreesW, and a corresponding paleopole at 19.4degreesN, 83.3degreesW, A(95) = 6.1degrees. Studies of baked contacts, country rocks distant from dykes, and later intrusions that cut them, show that the dykes became magnetized soon after intrusion. The paleopole is not significantly different from that obtained from the 1759 +/- 1 Ma post-orogenic Jan Lake Granite from the Hudsonian Orogen in southeast Saskatchewan. These paleopoles fall among a cluster previously determined from post-orogenic overprints in a wide variety of rocks and geological settings across Laurentia. Their mean is 20.8degreesN, 94.5degreesW, A(95) = 5.2degrees. Collectively they record a widespread remagnetization episode following the Hudsonian Orogeny, during which the polarity of the field remained constant. This single polarity interval (the Cleaver Superchron) has a mean age of approximately 1747 Ma, and its duration is at least 13 million years but is probably much longer. With further refinement, it could become a global statigraphical. marker. There are 18 paleopoles from red beds and igneous rocks which record the paleofield in western Laurentia mainly over an extended interval we estimate to be at least 100 million years between about 1960 and 1830 Ma during the Hudsonian Orogeny. Over this interval, western Laurentia remained at a low and essentially constant latitude. Reversals of the geomagnetic field occurred opposed magnetizations being of approximately equal frequency; there are numerous magnetochrons which could, in future, assist in regional stratigraphic correlations. On the basis of six studies, we estimate that the reference paleopole for this interval is at 1.1degreesS, 71.7degreesW, A(95) = 12.1degrees (N = 6). Paleopoles from the other 12 studies are spread over a 100degrees arc indicating large variable rotations about local vertical axes which probably resulted from transcurrent faulting caused by indentation of the bordering Archean Slave and Superior cratons during the Hudsonian Orogeny. These reference paleopoles show that during the Hudsonian Orogeny, western Laurentia was in paleolatitudes of 15-30degrees. During post-Hudsonian time (ca. 1750Ma) paleolatitudes were about 20degrees higher. Paleowind directions inferred by others, indicate that Laurentia during these intervals was in the northern hemisphere.

To evaluate the impact of salt dust on environment, monthly dust samples were collected from six monitoring stations between January 2020 and March 2023 and analyzed for dust and salt dust deposition flux (DF), mineral composition, water-soluble ions, trace elements, and carbonaceous content. The study used backward trajectory modeling, Pearson correlation, enrichment factor (EF) analysis, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) to quantify salt lake contributions to atmospheric dust. Results revealed that halite and gypsum content ranged from 0 to 47 wt%, with salt dust deposition flux (SDF) varying between 0 and 2.54 g/m(2)<middle dot>30d. Key soluble ions included non-playa salt sulfate (nps-SO42-), playa salt chloride (ps-Cl-), and sodium (ps-Na+). Trace elements such as iron, aluminum, silicon, and titanium originated from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The organic carbon to element carbon (OC/EC) ratio and PMF model pointed to vehicle emissions, coal combustion, and biomass burning as major pollution sources, particularly in urban areas. PMF analysis showed that salt lakes contributed 5.23%-29.76% of total dust mass, aligning with changes in soluble ion and halite gypsum content. As the region is a key source of river systems, the soluble salts in dust pose risks to glaciers and freshwater resources. These findings highlight the substantial impact of inland salt aerosols in arid inland regions, emphasizing that their contribution to atmospheric processes is significant and should not be overlooked. Plain Language Summary The ocean releases a lot of dust containing soluble salts (e.g., Na+ and Cl-) into inland areas, but we should not ignore the dust from salt lakes found in dry regions. Our study focuses on the Qaidam Basin in Northeastern Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, which has large salt lakes and a very delicate ecosystem. By continuously collecting dust samples from six observation stations in the southern part of the basin, we confirmed that dust from salt lakes is very important. We discovered that salt dust makes up a significant part of what falls from the atmosphere, which can harm glaciers and freshwater resources because of some ions it contains. Additionally, human activities and dust from the soil are also important sources of atmospheric dust. Our findings underscore the need for more attention to dust emissions from inland salt lakes, as previous studies may have overestimated the impact of ocean aerosols. Tackling the issue of saline dust emissions is essential for improving local air quality and protecting human health.

J	Wald, EJ; Kronberg, SL; Larson, GE; Johnson, WC				Wald, EJ; Kronberg, SL; Larson, GE; Johnson, WC			Dispersal of leafy Spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) seeds in the feces of wildlife	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is an exotic, perennial, invasive weed in many areas of the northern United States and Canada. There are many instances in pastures and wildlands where individual or small clusters of leafy spurge plants are distant and upslope from larger patches, and wildlife have been suspected as seed dispersal agents. Wildlife can disperse seeds by ingestion then excretion of seeds in their feces. Fecal deposits of free-ranging deer (Odocoileus hemionus and O. virginianus; n = 176), sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus; n = 201) and wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo; n = 206) were collected during a summer in Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) in western North Dakota, and for deer only in Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge (MLNWR) in northeastern Montana. Feces were analyzed for the presence of leafy spurge seeds and any seeds found were tested for germinability and viability. Only one intact leafy spurge seed was found in one grouse fecal deposit and it was not viable. No leafy spurge seed was found in turkey feces. Two seeds that appeared to be immature leafy spurge seeds were found in one deer fecal deposit in TRNP, but neither seed was viable. One leafy spurge seed was found in each of four deer fecal deposits from MLNWR, but only one seed was viable and germinated. Seed-feeding trials with captive deer (n = 4), sharp-tailed grouse (n = 4) and wild turkeys (n = 4) were conducted to determine how leafy spurge seeds interact with the digestive systems of these animals. The only viable seeds defecated by grouse and turkeys were seeds excreted one day after ingestion. Two turkeys did not excrete any leafy spurge seeds and only a few viable seeds were defecated by the other two. One grouse defecated a larger number of viable seeds, but the other three grouse excreted only a few. Deer defecated viable seeds each of 4 d after ingesting them with most viable seed excreted on the first 2 d. These findings, along with those for the free-ranging animals, indicate that wild turkeys probably do not disperse leafy spurge seed while sharp-tailed grouse and deer may do so on a limited basis.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	2005	154	2					342	357		10.1674/0003-0031(2005)154[0342:DOLSEE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2005)154[0342:DOLSEE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232670900007

We evaluate sources of individual variation in Cs-137 Of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) from a Norwegian lake contaminated by fall-out from the Chernobyl accident. Samples were collected on 14 occasions between July 1986 and October 1989. 2. The relationship between Cs-137 concentration, and fish weight, age and growth rate, changed with time. In 1986 the Cs-137 concentration in Arctic charr was negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with growth rate. Later, after a transition period, Cs-137 concentration in Arctic charr became positively correlated with weight and age, and negatively correlated with growth rate. The timing of this change was associated with changes in prey relative to fish radioactivity. 3. From September 1987 and throughout the study, the increase in Cs-137 concentration with fish weight could be described by a power-function with weight exponents of 0.39 and 0.11 for Arctic charr and brown trout, respectively. We could detect no diet changes with size in brown trout, while Arctic charr showed a diet shift from zooplankton to zoobenthos with increasing age and weight. This diet shift probably accounted for the larger increase in Cs-137 concentration with weight in charr than trout. 4. Variation in fish weight accounted for 29 and 11% of the individual variation in Cs-137 concentration in Arctic charr and brown trout, respectively. Most of the variation in caesium concentrations can be attributed to size independent factors, of which individual variation in diet composition is suggested to be the most important one. 5. Frequency distributions of Cs-137 concentration in fish were positively skewed, leptokurtic and differed significantly from the normal distribution, but not from the log-normal distribution. Individual variation in caesium concentration was rather large, and larger in Arctic charr than in brown trout, probably because of a wider niche utilization by Arctic charr than by brown trout. These large individual variations necessitate large sample sizes if representative values of Cs-137 concentration for the populations shall be obtained.

Wind and temperature structure can be determined from observations of the Doppler shift and Doppler broadening of the airglow and auroral emissions from the mesosphere and thermosphere. The mesospheric winds recorded at the end of August, September and early October 1992 are consistent with a semi-diurnal tidal variation. The amplitude of this variation is approximately 30 ms(-1) at the end of August and early September and approximately 20 ms(-1) at the end of September and early October. However, during June and July, the semi-diurnal tidal variation, if present, is weak, with amplitude < 5 ms(-1). No consistent semidiurnal tidal variation is observed during late October 1992. During the solstice period, antisymmetric tidal components may be preferentially generated in such a way that they can result in destructive interference with the normally dominant symmetric modes, resulting in a decrease of tidal variation. This is consistent with the observed decrease in tides during the June, July and late October periods. Near the equinoxes, however, the excitation of these antisymmetric modes is expected to be weaker, possibly explaining why a pronounced and consistent semi-diurnal tidal Variation has been observed during the August, September and early October periods. In contrast, the mesospheric winds derived from the Sheffield Meteor Wind Radar (53.4 degrees N, 1.5 degrees W) reveal a clear semi-diurnal tidal variation throughout the year, with an amplitude that may vary between 15 ms(-1) and 50 ms(-1), being about 25 ms(-1) on average. The IFPI records winds from a region of the atmosphere centred at 87 km, whereas the Sheffield Meteor Wind Radar measures winds centred at 95 km. Therefore, the two regions may experience different tidal modes due to the different latitude, longitude and altitude of the observed regions and/or the different topography of the observing sites. Some proposed reasons for these differences are presented.

The significance and timing of sheetflood vs braided channel deposition on lacustrine fan deltas, Junggar Basin, NW China	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The fan-delta reservoir play has become an important exploration target within the Junggar Basin, especially in the Mabei area within the Mahu Sag, where a fan-delta oil and gas pool has been recently discovered. The sedimentary characteristics, distribution patterns and formation mechanisms of the fan-delta clastic bodies in Lower Triassic Baikouquan Formation (T1b) were studied using seismic, well log and core data accompanied by a flume tank experiment and a modern analogue depositional study. The T1b in the Mabei area is composed of a fan delta consisting of fan-delta plain (including debris flow deposits, sheetflood deposits, braided channel deposits, and floodplain deposits), fan-delta front (including subaqueous reworked sheetflood deposits and distal sheetflood deposits) and muddy lake deposits. The sheetflood deposits, characterised by moderately sorted conglomerates with brown matrix, form during the peak flooding. They are widespread and sheet-like, occupying the major portion of the fan-delta plain. The braided channel deposits are characterised by well-sorted and clast-supported conglomerates and pebbly sandstones, formed later during the falling flow stage. Owing to the decline in volume and velocity, and the formation of continuously braided fluid flow, the sediments of the flood period are reworked, generating the braided channels. Laterally, the braided channels occur as belts of clastic bodies surrounded by continuous sheetflood deposits. Vertically, the braided channels are interbedded between the sheetflood deposits. The subaqueous reworked sheetflood deposits are characterised by greyish-green, well-sorted and clast-supported conglomerates, whereas the distal sheetflood deposits are characterised by well-sorted sandstones, intercalated with mudstone. The subaqueous reworked sheetflood and distal sheetflood deposits are a distal partly subaqueous extension of the main sheetflood deposits, albeit reworked by basinal currents and waves. The distal sheetflood deposits form on distal fringes of the sheetfloods and are more thoroughly reworked by longshore and wave currents. The braided channel, subaqueous reworked sheetflood and distal sheetflood deposits can form high-porosity reservoirs. These findings challenge the common view and suggest that the channelised facies on the fans are not the main flood events; rather, the more extensive sheetfloods are the major flood events.																			0812-0099	1440-0952					2017	64	7					919	930		10.1080/08120099.2017.1379436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2017.1379436													WOS:000415670200006

SULFUR	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					CONF ON SALT LAKES, EVAPORITES AND AEOLIAN DEPOSITS	AUG 08-16, 1988	ARKAROOLA, AUSTRALIA	SALT LAKES EVAPORITES & AEOLIAN DEPOSITS PROGRAM				The delta-S-34 values of a variety of gypsum types from the modern playa lakes of southern Australia show little relationship with underlying bedrock types or the delta-S-34 values of the bedrock sulphur. On a regional scale, in both Western Australia (Yilgarn Block) and South Australia, the delta-S-34 values of surficial gypsum have a regular pattern over distances of 500 to 1000 km with highest values (approximately + 21 parts per thousand) near coastlines decreasing to delta-S-34 values of approximately 14 parts per thousand further inland. Sea-salt sulphate is the dominant source of sulphur to the lakes investigated, although the proportion decreases from approximately 100% near coastlines to approximately 55% in some inland areas. A secondary source of sulphate is also airborne, but derives from volatile biogenic sulphur compounds of largely marine origin. Sulphur derived from rock weathering is a minor component, except in areas where the bedrock contains abundant sulphur. Thus Lake Cadibarrawirracanna receives approximately 10% of its sulphur from weathering of the pyritic Bulldog Shale (Cretaceous), and Lake Amadeus, possibly up to one-third of its sulphate from evaporites of the Bitter Springs Formation (Late Proterozoic). Our delta-S-34 measurements are the first tracers to directly establish the marine origin of components in Australian surface brines. The delta-S-34 analyses indicate the accession of sulphur from both sea-salt and marine biogenic sulphur and clearly support delivery of salts to the Australian landscape as aerosols following established wind patterns. The data negate the possibility of derivation of the lacustrine "seawater-like" brine chemistry from either marine transgressions or weathering of connate salts from marine strata alone. The occurrence of non-marine evaporites exhibiting largely marine-like chemistry and isotopic signatures is probably common to low-latitude tectonically stable areas and will make the distinction between some marine and non-marine evaporites from the geological record more difficult. The regular pattern of delta-S-34 values of surficial sulphate in lakes and groundwaters in southern Australia provides an ideal baseline against which to search for anomalous delta-S-34 values associated with base-metal or gold mineralization.

Spatial variation in flux, δ13C and δ2H of methane in a small Arctic lake with fringing wetland in western Greenland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Small lakes in northern latitudes represent a significant source of CH4 to the atmosphere that is predicted to increase with warming in the Arctic. Yet, whole-lake CH4 budgets are lacking as are measurements of delta C-13-CH4 and delta H-2-CH4. In this study, we quantify spatial variability of diffusive and ebullitive fluxes of CH4 and corresponding delta C-13-CH4 and delta H-2-CH4 in a small, Arctic lake system with fringing wetland in southwestern Greenland during summer. Net CH4 flux was highly variable, ranging from an average flux of 7 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in the deep-water zone to 154 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1) along the lake margin. Diffusive flux accounted for similar to 8.5 % of mean net CH4 flux, with plant-mediated and ebullitive flux accounting for the balance of the total net flux. Methane content of emitted ebullition was low (mean +/- SD 10 +/- 17 %) compared to previous studies from boreal lakes and wetlands. Isotopic composition of net CH4 emissions varied widely throughout the system, with delta C-13-CH4 ranging from -66.2 to -55.5 %, and delta H-2-CH4 ranging from -345 to -258 %. Carbon isotope composition of CH4 in ebullitive flux showed wider variation compared to net flux, ranging from -69.2 to -49.2 %. Dissolved CH4 concentrations were highest in the sediment and decreased up the water column. Higher concentrations of CH4 in the hypoxic deep water coincided with decreasing dissolved O-2 concentrations, while methanotrophic oxidation dominated in the epilimnion based upon decreasing concentrations and increasing values of delta C-13-CH4 and delta H-2-CH4. The most deplete delta C-13- and H-2-isotopic values were observed in profundal bottom waters and in subsurface profundal sediments. Based upon paired delta C-13 and delta H-2 observations of CH4, acetate fermentation was likely the dominant production pathway throughout the system. However, isotopic ratios of CH4 in deeper sediments were consistent with mixing/transition between CH4 production pathways, indicating a higher contribution of the CO2 reduction pathway. The large spatial variability in fluxes of CH4 and in isotopic composition of CH4 throughout a single lake system indicates that the underlying mechanisms controlling CH4 cycling (production, consumption and transport) are spatially heterogeneous. Net flux along the lake margin dominated whole-lake flux, suggesting the nearshore littoral area dominates CH4 emissions in these systems. Future studies of whole-lake CH4 budgets should consider this significant spatial heterogeneity.					; White, Jeffrey/A-6965-2017	Sauer, Peter/0000-0002-3756-4366; White, Jeffrey/0000-0002-7541-3737													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2016	131	1-2					17	33		10.1007/s10533-016-0261-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0261-1													WOS:000391423500002
J	Page, KS; Wagner, CP; Lewis, E				Page, Kevin S.; Wagner, Curtis P.; Lewis, Edward			Using mark-recapture techniques to evaluate catch and release, recycling, and associated survival probabilities of stocked Muskellunge at two Ohio reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveMuskellunge Esox masquinongy fisheries in Ohio are almost exclusively catch and release. Catch and release is expected to benefit anglers via recaptures of previously caught fish (i.e., recycling). We used mark-recapture techniques to evaluate catch-and-release dynamics over multiple years in two stocked Muskellunge fisheries in Ohio.MethodsMuskellunge were collected and tagged each spring by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife (ODNR-DOW) at Clearfork Reservoir (1991-2006) and Leesville Lake (2016-2022). A total of 4139 Muskellunge were tagged, of which 38% (n = 1575) were recaptured at least once by either the ODNR-DOW or anglers. A total of 252 anglers reported 1339 catches of tagged fish. Multistate modeling was used to estimate survival and transition probabilities across years for the following marked fish states: at large (L, ODNR-DOW marked fish not reported caught by anglers); catch and release (C, those fish reported caught and released by anglers); and recycled (R, catch-and-release fish caught and reported by anglers again). Transition probabilities between states L to C and C to R estimated Muskellunge catch and release and recycling, respectively.ResultRaw angler catch reports indicated that intra-annual recycling was rare, with the median time between recapture events exceeding a year. Modeled annual survival probability of L fish at Clearfork Reservoir and Leesville Lake was 0.67 and 0.87, respectively. About a quarter of these fish were caught and released by anglers at both reservoirs. Survival of C fish was lower than L fish at both reservoirs (Clearfork Reservoir = 0.58; Leesville Lake = 0.67), suggesting a "catch-and-release effect" on survival. Joint probability of catch-and-release fish surviving and being recycled annually was 0.24 and 0.23 for Clearfork Reservoir and Leesville Lake, respectively.ConclusionIntegration of survival and catch probabilities over the long-term provides a comprehensive evaluation of catch-and-release dynamics. Estimates suggest that post-catch-and-release survival and probability of recycling may be lower than anticipated, which may have implications for managing Muskellunge fisheries and angler expectations.

J	Eronen, M; Hyvärinen, H; Zetterberg, P				Eronen, M; Hyvärinen, H; Zetterberg, P			Holocene humidity changes in northern Finnish Lapland inferred from lake sediments and submerged Scots pines dated by tree-rings	HOLOCENE												Conclusive evidence for a rise in water levels has been found in connection with lake-sediment studies undertaken partly in collaboration with the pine megafossil sampling and dendrochronological work in northern Finnish Lapland. The change in lake-level stands is shown by slow sedimentation rate in the early to mid-Holocene and an increase thereafter. These data indicate a regional rise in water levels during the latter part of the Holocene following a relatively dry period between 8000 and 4000 BP. Synchronous changes, also indicating rising water levels, have been observed in the diatom and cladoceran assemblages of the sediment cores. Subfossil Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris, L.) have been preserved in large quantities in small lakes in Lapland, because in many cases the rising water level has inundated the trunks after death. The position of the subfossil trunks and stumps often indicates that the pines have been growing on dry land at the sides of the lakes in which they are now submerged. Traces of a bark beetle (Tomicus minor, Hart.) have been detected in a few old pine logs found far outside the present distribution area of this insect. A total of 1722 samples of pine subfossils have been collected in the forest-tundra ecotone region of Lapland to build a continuous pine ring-width chronology over 7000 years long. The long chronology is almost finished, but its two parts are still separated by a short discontinuity around 250 Be. An absolutely dated, year-by-year chronology over 2000 years long extends from the present close to that time. The older, over 5000 years long continuous floating chronology is fixed to the timescale by several radiocarbon dates. A total of 1212 samples of pine wood have been dared and assembled within the chronologies by tree-ring cross-matching. These substantial data indicate a gradual retreat of pine tree and forest limits with some marked regional differences during the past 5000 years. According to the preliminary interpretations of the tree-ring data the variability of Holocene summer temperatures has increased towards the present time. Shifts in climatic development leading to cooler and more unstable conditions seem to have occurred in mid-Holocene time, and between 2500 and 2000 BP. The increase in humidity is probably in association with these changes in the high-frequency variability of temperature.																			0959-6836					SEP	1999	9	5					569	580		10.1191/095968399677209885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968399677209885													WOS:000082453600008

In the austral summer of 2005 visible and infrared observations of the Erebus lava lake were obtained with sensors on three space vehicles Terra (ASTER, MODIS), Aqua (MODIS) and EO-1 (Hyperion, ALI). Contemporaneous ground-based observations were obtained with hand-held infrared cameras. This allowed a quantitative comparison of the thermal data obtained from different instruments, and of the analytical techniques used to analyze the data, both with and without the constraints imposed by ground-truth. From the thermal camera data, in December 2005 the main Erebus lava lake (Ray Lake) had an area of approximate to 820 m(2). Surface colour temperatures ranged from 575 K to 1090 K, with a broad peak in the distribution from 730 K to 850 K. Total heat loss was estimated at 23.5 MW. The flux density was approximate to 29 kW m(-2). Mass flux was estimated at 64 to 93 kg s(-1). The best correlation between thermal emission and emitting area was obtained with ASTER, which has the best combination of spatial resolution and wavelength coverage, especially in the thermal infrared. The high surface temperature of the lava lake means that Hyperion data are for the most part saturated. Uncertainties, introduced by the need to remove incident sunlight cause the thermal emission from the Hyperion data to be a factor of about two greater than that measured by hand-held thermal camera. MODIS also over-estimated thermal output from the lava lake by the same factor of two because it was detecting reflected sunlight from the rest of the pixel area. The measurement of the detailed temperature distribution on the surface of an active terrestrial lava lake will allow testing of thermal emission models used to interpret remote-sensing data of volcanism on lo, where no such ground-truth exists. Although the Erebus lava lake is four orders of magnitude smaller than the lava lake at Pele on lo, the shape of the integrated thermal emission spectra are similar. Thermal emission from this style of effusive volcanism appears to be invariant. Excess thermal emission in most Pele spectra (compared to Erebus) at short wavelengths (<3 mu m) is most likely due to disruption of the surface on the lava lake by escaping volatiles.

Cultivable bacterial composition and BIOLOG catabolic diversity of biofilm communities developed on Phragmites australis	AQUATIC BOTANY												Biofilm samples formed on submerged young and old stems of reed, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steudel were taken during summer at different sites of Lake Velencei, Hungary. BIOLOG GN microplates were used to analyze the patterns of sole carbon source utilizations by microbial communities. From the carbon sources, carbohydrates and amino acids were preferred by all microbial communities. In the case of the old reed stem samples, higher number of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polymers were used than in young samples. Biofilm bacterial communities from the old reed samples of the nature conservation area of the lake used the highest number of (>= 50% of the available) substrates. In principal component analysis (PCA), the metabolic potential of the microbial communities from the middle open water region of the lake showed the smallest variability. The variability within metabolic potential of the reed stem microbial communities from a given sampling site was the largest in the case of samples originating from the western, reed-covered nature conservation area. A total of 251 bacterial isolates obtained after serial dilutions and plating onto different media were characterized by traditional phenotypic tests. The strains showed high activities mainly in the hydrolysis of certain biopolymers (gelatine and casein). PCA was used to evaluate the phenotypic variability of strain groups of different sampling sites. The two open water regions were similar to each other, and separated from the western reed covered part of the lake. Similarly to the BIOLOG community-level physiological profiles, strain groups of the young and old reed stem samples originating from the nature conservation area had the largest metabolic potential. On the basis of 16S rDNA sequence analysis, 23 representative strains with different ARDRA patterns were identified. The cultivation-based investigations of bacterial diversity showed characteristic differences in the number of identified taxa in connection with the sampling sites. No characteristic differences could be observed according to medium or sample type (young, first year and more than 1-year old stems) among the identified species. 16S rDNA sequence comparisons resulted in the identification of the genera Aureobacterium, Arthrobacter, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Rhodococcus, Bacillus, Marinibacillus, Rhodobacter, Defluvibacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia and Aeromonas.

This correlation has enabled the section to be related to Muller's (1974) tentative Eemian absolute chronology, and shows that the Hollerup Eemian sediments appear to cover c. 11,000 yr. Our studies show that the onset of the Eemian was characterized by a major lake level rise followed by an almost 3000 yr long period of high, but oscillating lake levels. It is argued that the latter part of this period of highly maritime climate can be defined as the Eemian climatic optimum. This period was interrupted by a few hundred years long phase of low lake level, coinciding with the immigration of spruce, followed by medium-high lake levels. The next c. 3500 yr, coinciding with the Carpinus pollen zone, seem to have been characterized by fairly humid and mild conditions, although slightly more arid than during the preceding optimum. The Carpinus period ended with a more than 1000 yr long gradual lake level fall, and this period of lake level change, concurring with the transition into the Pinus pollen dominated period, terminated with an extreme low lake level event. This 300-500 yr long arid phase coincides with a distinct peak in pine pollen, and was followed by higher but slightly oscillating lake levels in a cooler climate. The end of the Eemian seems to have been characterised by a gradual cooling, until almost pure elastic sedimentation and a marked expansion of herb pollen grains mark the onset of the Weichselian. Based on regional correlations to other European terrestrial and North Atlantic marine proxy records, we argue that the distinct hydrologic and climatic events displayed in the Hollerup record were possibly caused by a combination of sea level changes, changes in the hydrologic cycle and changing oceanic circulation patterns. The latter two may have been triggered by the opening and closure of the Baltic Sea-White Sea connection, the initial build-up of continental ice sheets, and the first major impacts of meltwater induced freshwater in key areas for thermohaline circulation.

Most existing studies on urban water systems have focused on individual water cycle processes linked with water supply and sewage treatment plants, but mutual feedback between the water cycle and its associated material circulation and water ecology, as well as human processes, still needs further exploration. In this paper, the concept, theory, and technical methodology of the urban water system were developed based on the water cycle and basin water system science. The Urban Water System 5.0 (UWS 5.0) model was developed by integrating the Time Variant Gain rainfall-runoff Model with Urban water system (TVGM_Urban) in different underlying surface conditions for analyzing the natural-social water cycle processes and their associated water environmental and ecological processes and the influence of multiscale sponge measures. Herein, five major simulation functions were realized: rainfall-runoff-nonpoint source pollutant load, water and pollutant transportations through the drainage network system, terminal regulation and purification, socioeconomic water cycle, and water system assessment and regulation. The location for the case study used in this paper was Wuhan City. The findings showed that the entire urban water system should consider the built-up area and its associated rivers and lakes as the research object and explore the integrations among the urban natural-social water cycle and river regulations inside and outside of the city as well as the effects of socioeconomic development and sponge measures on the water quantity-quality-ecology processes. The UWS 5.0 model efficiently simulated the urban rainfall-runoff process, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in water bodies, and characteristic indicators of socioeconomic development. For the rainfall-runoff simulations, the correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) fall under the excellent and good classes, respectively. For the TN and TP concentration simulations, results exhibited good bias and the correlation coefficients exceeded 0.90 for 78.1% of the sampled sites. The simulation of 18 socioeconomic indicators provided excellent bias, correlation coefficient, and NSE values of 100%, 83.3%, and 69.4% to total indicators, respectively. Based on the well-calibrated UWS 5.0 model, the source sponge, artificial enhancement, and source reduction-path interception-terminal treatment measures were optimized, which considerably mitigated waterlogging, black and odorous water, and lake eutrophication, respectively. The mitigation performance revealed that the maximum inundated area for a once-in-10-year rainfall event was reduced by 32.6%, the removal ratio of the black and odorous water area was 65%, the comprehensive trophic state index of water bodies was reduced by 37%, and the green development level of Wuhan City in 2020 increased from 0.56 to 0.67. This study is expected to advance the intersection and development of multidisciplinary fields (e.g., urban hydrology, environmental science, and ecology) and offer an important theoretical and technical basis for solving urban complex water issues and promoting green development of cities.					she, dunxian/B-4667-2018; Zhang, Yongyong/I-9367-2014; ZHANG, Xiang/H-3158-2013; Luo, Anqi/KEJ-6939-2024; yang, jun/GQH-0635-2022	Luo, Anqi/0000-0001-5069-108X; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				MAR	2024	67	3					704	724		10.1007/s11430-023-1226-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-023-1226-9		JAN 2024											WOS:001157191300001

River flooding and landscape changes impact ecological conditions of a scour hole lake in the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A 400-year sediment record from an 18 m deep scour hole lake (Haarsteegse Wiel) near the Meuse River in the Netherlands was investigated for past changes in water quality, flooding frequency and landscape change using geophysical, geochemical and micropaleontological information. The results are highly significant for determining long-term trends of water quality, the impact of atmospheric (as SCP, spheroidal carbonaceous particles) and industrial (chromium) pollution on the terrestrial and aquatic flora, and the impact of river floods. The studied sediment record was dated by combining Cs-137 activities, biostratigraphical ages, micro-tephra layers, and historically documented floods indicated by the magnetic susceptibility. The oldest flooding event is indicated at AD 1610 when the lake was created by water masses bursting through a dike. Large historical river floods are well documented in regional chronicles and thus may provide reliable age calibration points. Based on assumptions about the timing of flood events and constant rate of sedimentation, it appears that sedimentation rates in Haarsteegse Wiel declined after ca. AD 1880. This decline might be a result of a widespread change from wheat cultivation to pasture land from around AD 1875 as a direct result of falling wheat prices and intensified cattle farming linked to the agricultural crisis in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Water quality changes and absolute phosphorus concentrations were reconstructed using a diatom-based transfer function. Results show that the currently nutrient-rich lake has mostly been in a mesotrophic state prior to ca. AD 1920, with the exception of several apparently sharp eutrophication events that were coeval with river floods. River flooding also impacted the vegetation composition by importing allochthonous components, and indirectly by the influx of nutrients which had a clear influence on the composition of the water plant communities and aquatic species diversity. Magnetic susceptibility changes and pollen data show that within the period AD 1610-1740, within the Little Ice Age period, several undocumented floods may have occurred. Thus, documentation of geophysical, geochemical, and biological flooding signals in a high-resolution archive present the possibility to detect flooding regimes further back in time.					; Donders, Timme/J-5044-2012	Donders, Timme/0000-0003-4698-3463; Hoek, Wim/0000-0001-7313-100X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2010	44	3					789	801		10.1007/s10933-010-9452-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9452-2													WOS:000281973500004
J	FOX, GA				FOX, GA			EGGSHELL QUALITY - ITS ECOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN A DDE-CONTAMINATED COMMON TERN POPULATION	WILSON BULLETIN												A portable beta-backscatter gauge was used to measure the shell quality of 416 eggs laid in a colony of Common Terns [Sterna hirundo] located on Buffalo Lake, Alberta, Canada (52.degree. 20'' N, 112.degree. 50'' W) in 1972. Eggshell quality as measured by beta-backscatter (a composite response to thickness, chemical composition and ultrastructure) was an important determinant of hatching success. Abnormalities in shell structure and chemical composition were responsible for shell damage, which resulted in egg disappearance, and for death through hypoxia. There were also indications that low levels of DDE contamination had detrimental effects on the visual perception of chicks. No difference in intensity of incubation instinct could be detected between parents who produced eggs with high and low quality shells. Eggshells had a mean thickness index which was 3.8% lower than the pre-1945 mean for this geographical population. Denting of shells accompanied a 13.3% decrease in the thickness index which was not accompanied by a significant decrease in Ca content, but by increased molar Mg:Ca ratio. Dented shells and shells of eggs in which the embryo died had significant increased P contents when compared to shells surrounding viable embryos. Although small size of the pre-1945 sample prevented statistical comparisons, the chemical and physical characteristics of shells surrounding viable embryos were very similar to pre-1945 shells. Scanning EM revealed that shells of eggs in which embryos died had 44% fewer pores, and 21% fewer mammillae which were larger and more irregular in their distribution than those of shells of eggs which hatched. Evaporative water loss from eggs which were incubated but failed to hatch was 39% less than that from eggs which hatched, reflecting the reduction in pore numbers. The mean DDE content of 39 eggs with nondented shells was 3.42 ppm wet wt, while 5 eggs with dented shells contained a mean of 6.77 ppm. PCB''s [polychlorinated biphenyls] were present at about 1/10 the concentration of DDE. Food fish from Buffalo Lake contained a mean DDE content of 0.02 ppm wet wt basis. Contamination is assumed to occur on the wintering grounds.																			0043-5643						1976	88	3					459	477																WOS:A1976CJ11000007

In large channel-type reservoirs, it additionally influenced by inflows and reservoir regulation. However, the surface turbulent mixing and its impact on phytoplankton dynamics in these channel-type reservoirs have rarely been investigated, despite its potential to significantly influence the vertical distribution of phytoplankton, which are crucial for understanding the health and productivity of large regulated water systems. In this study, high-frequency meteorological data, water temperature, flow velocity, and phytoplankton parameters were continuously measured for one week in Xiangjiaba Reservoir, located in the upper Yangtze River, during early spring, divided into two periods: a 5-day period of normal conditions and 2 days experiencing cold fronts. During the initial phase, diurnal variations in thermal structure, mixing scales, and chlorophyll-a were observed, with an average bulk Richardson number (Ri(bulk)) of 3.6 and relatively low turbulence dissipation rates (epsilon) ranging from 10(-9) similar to 10(-5) W/kg. In the subsequent cold front events, stronger atmospheric forces and intensified hydrodynamics resulted in a decrease in Ri(bulk). During wind and convection co-occurrence, Ribulk dropped to similar to 1.84, and the co-effects between these forces increased the mixed depth;while Ri(bulk) decreased further to 0.71 with only convection, deepening the mixed layer even more. Cold fronts markedly increased near-surface turbulence with epsilon escalating to 10(-4) similar to 10(-3) W/kg during wind-convection events and 10(-5) similar to 10(-4) W/kg during the convective-only period. Thermal stratification and active mixing regulated the phytoplankton vertical distribution. When stratified, diurnal vertical migrations of Eudorina elegans determine the Chl-a distribution, while the thermocline can act as a physical barrier, confining phytoplankton near its depth. In contrast, actively wind-induced mixing redistributed phytoplankton more evenly throughout the water column, while convective mixing led to the formation of a deep chlorophyll-a peak, indicative of phytoplankton downward migration.					zhu, xinyu/HJJ-1063-2023; Morovati, Khosro/R-7855-2019; Lidi, Shi/MGT-7997-2025; Gualtieri, Carlo/A-5686-2009	Lidi, Shi/0000-0001-6746-2726; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2025	659								133220	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133220		APR 2025											WOS:001465655900001

Both conditions are met for most lakes in Bohemia and Slovakia. Since 1978 we have studied mountain lakes in the Sumava and in the High Tatra Mountains. In Sumava the three lakes under study are of glacial origin. The catchments are small, with steep sides covered by spruce. The bedrocks are biotite-rich paragneiss, together with gneiss, quartzite and granite. In summer 1936 surface pH was 5.7-6.9 in the Lake Certovo and 6.9-7.0 in the Lake Cerne. Now the pH values are 4.3-4.8 in the two lakes and in the Lake Prasilske as well. Old reports on zooplankton are from the years 1871, 1892-96, 1935-37, 1947 and 1960. Since 1979 we have not found any planktonic Crustacea in the lakes Cerne and Certovo. Lake Prasilske is inhabited by Daphnia longispina and Cyclops abyssorum. In July 1989 the pH values were 4.4, 4.7 and 4.7, concentrations of labile monomeric Al were 0.83, 0.68 and 0.24 mg l-1 in the lakes Certovo, Cerne and Prasilske, respectively. High levels of toxic Al compounds might be responsible for the extinction of planktonic Crustacea in the lakes Certovo and Cerne. All the three lakes are void of fish at present. In the High Tatra Mts. we examined more than 40 lakes above timberline in altitudes 1 12-2145 m. They are all clearwater, naturally fishless lakes. The bedrock is granite. Owing to different levels of calcium the lakes are now in different stages of acidification. According to recent changes in the zooplankton they can be divided into three groups: (1) Species composition of planktonic Crustacea has not changed. (2) Planktonic Crustacea were present until 1973 but are absent now. (3) From the original species of Crustacea only Chydorus sphaericus is present. The three groups are well separated along the gradients of calcium, ANC and pH. They can be identified with the Henriksen's bicarbonate (our group 1), intermediate (our group 2) and acid (our group 3) lakes. We suppose that in the process of acidification the lakes of the group (2) have been shifted from oligotrophy to ultraoligotrophy.

In the past 25 years the iron ore pits have gradually filled with groundwater and surface water, forming lakes on the Cuyuna, Mesabi, and Vermillion Iron Ranges in northeastern Minnesota. Most remain abandoned, but besides creating a small number of recreational parks and fisheries, the regional economic development agency promoted approximately 20 of the pit lakes for economic reclamation by using them for salmonid aquaculture. Intensive net-pen aquaculture was carried out from 1988 to 1995 in the Twin City-South and Sherman pit lakes on the Mesabi Range. A water quality controversy resulted over the potential for long-term degradation of the lakes and regional aquifer. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency then mandated that aquaculture be terminated in Twin City-South in May 1993 and the lake restored to preaquaculture conditions by 1996. With no management other than artificial aeration for one summer, the lake rapidly recovered to near baseline water quality and returned to an oligomesotrophic (unproductive) status. Within 18 months the phosphorus budget was typical of reference pit lakes in the area and dissolved oxygen in bottom water remained above similar to 4 mg O(2)/L without artificial aeration. Algal growth was low in 1993, due to light limitation from artificial mixing, but it remained low in 1994 without any management due to renewed phosphorus limitation. Inorganic nitrogen initially decreased faster than expected, at a rate similar to its increase during intensive aquaculture. More rapid reductions in water column nutrients might have occurred in 1993 by reducing aeration to allow anoxia in the lower hypolimnion, promoting denitrification and minimizing sediment resuspension, but this was precluded by water quality standards. The "natural" burial of solid wastes under inorganic sediment eroded from the basin walls effectively minimized transport of sediment nutrients to the overlying water. Fallowing for several years provided a simple, effective method for restoration of these pit lakes from aquacultural impacts. No change attributable to aquaculture was observed in the water quality of three nearby pit lakes, including a drinking water source. This fact suggests that there were few or no impacts from off-site migration of aquaculturally enriched water into the regional aquifer.																			1061-2971					MAR	1998	6	1					1	19		10.1046/j.1526-100x.1998.00612.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100x.1998.00612.x													WOS:000072503300001
J	Talon, B; Payette, S; Fillon, L; Delwaide, A				Talon, B; Payette, S; Fillon, L; Delwaide, A			Reconstruction of the long-term fire history of an old-growth deciduous forest in Southern Quebec, Canada, from charred wood in mineral soils	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Charcoal particles are widespread in terrestrial and lake environments of the northern temperate and boreal biomes where they are used to reconstruct past fire events and regimes. In this study, we used botanically identified and radiocarbon-dated charcoal macrofossils in mineral soils as a paleoecological tool to reconstruct past fire activity at the stand scale. Charcoal macrofossils buried in podzolic soils by tree uprooting were analyzed to reconstruct the long-term fire history of an old-growth deciduous forest in southern Quebec. Charcoal fragments were sampled from the uppermost mineral soil horizons and identified based on anatomical characters. Spruce (Picea spp.) fragments dominated the charcoal assemblage, along with relatively abundant wood fragments of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and birch (Betula spp.), and rare fragments of pine (Pinus cf. strobus) and white cedar (Thuja canadensis). AMS radiocarbon dates from 16 charcoal fragments indicated that forest fires were widespread during the early Holocene, whereas no fires were recorded from the mid-Holocene to present. The paucity of charcoal data during this period, however, does not preclude that a fire event of lower severity may have occurred. At least eight forest fires occurred at the study site between 10,400 and 6300 cal yr B.P., with a dominance of burned conifer trees between 10,400 and 9000 cal yr B.P. and burned conifer and deciduous trees between 9000 and 6300 cal yr B.P. Based on the charcoal record, the climate at the study site was relatively dry during the early Holocene, and more humid from 6300 cal yr B.P. to present. However, it is also possible that the predominance of conifer trees in the charcoal record between 10,400 and 6300 cal yr B.P. created propitious conditions for fire spreading. The charcoal record supports inferences based on pollen influx data (Labelle, C., Richard, P.J.H. 1981. Vegetation tardiglaciaire et postglaciaire au sud-est do Pare des Laurentides, Quebec. Geographie Physique et Quaternaire 35, 345-359) of the early arrival of spruce and sugar maple in the study area shortly after deglaciation. We conclude that macroscopic charcoal analysis of mineral soils subjected to disturbance by tree uprooting may be a useful paleoecological tool to reconstruct long-term forest fire history at the stand scale.

Analysis of lacustrine carbonate rocks in Shashi Formation of Paleocene shows that the delta 13CPDB values of carbonate rocks range from -4.8 %o to -1.0 %o, with an average value of -3.3 %o. The delta 18OPDB values ranged from -5.4 %o to -0.6 %o, with an average value of -3.2 %o. The positive correlation between delta 13CPDB and delta 18OPDB of the Shashi Formation carbonate rocks indicates that they developed in a relatively closed brackish lake system with obvious evaporation. The homogenization temperature of the upper Shashi Formation in Jiangling sag ranges from 15.3 degrees C to 51.8 degrees C, mainly concentrated in 25-30 degrees C. The delta 18O isotope of halite inclusions ranges from -0.8%o to 9.4%o, with an average of 4.9%o. The delta D isotope of halite inclusions ranges from -91.3%o to -65.0%o with an average of -79.3%o, which are all lower than the Global Meteoric Water Line. The intense evaporation environment is consistent with the overall drought paleoclimate at that time. The quantitative LA-ICP-MS was used to analyze the composition of the primary inclusion of halite, and it was concluded that the original brine composition was Na-K-Mg-Cl-SO4 system with relative low concentration of Ca2+, high concentration of Mg and SO42- ions and K ions. The high content of Li, B, Br and Rb is related to the intense volcanic activity, deep fluid source and hot spring recharge in Jiangling Depression at that time. Based on carbonate carbon and oxygen isotopes, fluid inclusions temperature and composition, it is concluded that during the Shashi Formation period of Paleocene in Jiangling Sag, the lake basin was well sealed, with high salinity and high temperature, and belonged to a salt lake sedimentary environment, which was favorable for the deposit of salt deposits.					; wang, jiuyi/KHZ-2030-2024	Wang, Chunlian/0000-0002-3449-4315; 													0169-1368	1872-7360				MAR	2024	166								105949	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.105949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.105949		FEB 2024											WOS:001207505300001
J	Liao, XR; Meng, C; Cai, BF; Zhao, WJ				Liao, Xianrui; Meng, Chong; Cai, Baofeng; Zhao, Wenjin			Interval-Parameter Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (IPTSP) Model of Ecological Water Replenishment Scheme in the National Nature Reserve for Improved Suitable Habitat for Rare and Endangered Migrant Birds	WATER												In this work, an interval-parameter two-stage stochastic programming (IPTSP) model of water resources allocation was established for maximizing the restored habitat area of large, rare, and endangered water birds by adjusting the recommended scheme of water replenishment under different scenarios and constraints. The established model can efficiently deal with the uncertainties, such as the interval parameters and random variables, in the management system of water resources simultaneously. A case study was conducted in the Momoge National Nature Reserve (MNNR) in northeast China to maximize the restored habitat area of large, rare and endangered water birds based on limited water resources. According to the previous studies, a water area with a depth of 0-40 cm is a suitable habitat area in the MNNR for the Siberian crane, oriental stork, and red-crowned crane. The results of the present work show that the habitat area restored by water replenishment schemes under low, medium, and high flood flow scenarios after optimization increased in comparison to 13.36 x 10(3)ha of the recommended scheme, with an increase of [0.62, 5.23], [1.49, 6.42], and [2.43, 7.17] x 10(3)ha, respectively (the two numbers within each bracket represent the lower and upper bounds of the restored habitat areas). As a result, the carrying capacity of suitable habitat areas increased by [0.82, 6.88], [1.96, 8.45], and [3.21, 9.43] x 10(3)birds, correspondingly. The restored wetland area of the project recommendation scheme was 34.23 x 10(3)ha, and that of the optimal water replenishment schemes was [29.35, 41.01], [31.02, 44.13], and [33.88, 46.04] x 10(3)ha, respectively under the three flood flow scenarios. The results reveal that the model constructed in this work realizes the optimization and adjustment of the initial scheme to an increased restored wetland and habitat area with an increase in the flow level. Here, the upper bound of the interval value mentioned above is significantly higher than the lower bound value, which indicates that a feasible decision space was provided for decision makers to optimize and adjust the recommended scheme on the basis of the actual situation. The model-optimized schemes significantly improved the utilization of limited water resources. The results of this study can provide valuable theoretical support for the restoration and protection of rare and endangered water bird habitats and planning and management of water resources.

J	Rodusky, AJ; Maki, RP; Sharfstein, B				Rodusky, Andrew J.; Maki, Ryan P.; Sharfstein, Bruce			Back-pumping of agricultural runoff into a large shallow lake and concurrent changes in the macroinvertebrate assemblage	WATER RESEARCH												Macroinvertebrates were monitored during the summer of 2001 at two paired reference and impact sites, to assess potential effects of agricultural runoff, which was back-pumped upstream into Lake Okeechobee, USA. Monitoring was conducted prior to back-pumping (Pre, April-May), during back-pumping (BP, June-September) and during the following year (Post, April-September, 2002, impact sites only). Prior to back-pumping, the macroinvertebrate communities at both impact sites differed from those at their respective reference sites. During back-pumping, differences in the macroinvertebrate communities were slightly less pronounced among the eastern pair of sites but were more pronounced at the western sites than they were prior to back-pumping. There also were marginal differences in the macroinvertebrate communities at both impact sites between the Pre and BP periods, while very little change was observed in the communities among the same periods at both reference sites. For the Post-Pre and Post-BP period comparisons, there were clear differences between the macroinvertebrate communities at the western impact site, while less pronounced differences were observed at the eastern impact site. This suggests that the Post back-pumping assemblage did not return to that observed prior to back-pumping activity. During BP, several water-quality variables appeared to be different among each of the paired sites and the correlation between water-quality variables and macroinvertebrate community structure was strong at the western sites but weaker at the eastern sites. This suggests that a combination of abiotic variables may have been influencing the community structure at the western sites while back-pumping was occurring. Macroinvertebrates at all sites reflected poor water quality, but more taxonomic changes during back-pumping were observed at the impact sites than at the reference sites. It is not known if these taxonomic changes resulted in impacts among the macroinvertebrate community or to higher-trophic-level predators such as fish. If lake restoration activities result in a shift to a less pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrate community, and the anticipated reduction in future back-pumping activity does not occur, the macroinvertebrate community may return to one that is dominated by pollution-tolerant taxa in affected portions of the lake.

Late Quaternary Changes in Lakes, Vegetation, and Climate in the Bonneville Basin Reconstructed from Sediment Cores from Great Salt Lake	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											Sediment cores from Great Salt Lake (GSL) provide the basis for reconstructing changes in lakes, vegetation, and climate for the last similar to 40 cal ka. Initially, the coring site was covered by a shallow saline lake and surrounded by Artemisia steppe or steppetundra under a cold and dry climate. As Lake Bonneville began to rise (from similar to 30 to 28 cal ka), Pinus and subalpine conifer pollen percentages increased and Artemisia declined, suggesting the onset of wetter conditions. Lake Bonneville oscillated near the Stansbury shoreline between similar to 26 and similar to 24 cal ka, rose to the Bonneville shoreline by similar to 18 cal ka, and then fell to the Provo shoreline, which it occupied until similar to 15 cal ka. Vegetation changed during this time span, albeit not always with the same direction or amplitude as the lake. The pollen percentages of Pinus and subalpine conifers were high from similar to 25 to 21.5 cal ka, indicating cool and moist conditions during the Stansbury oscillation and for much of the rise toward the Bonneville shoreline. Pinus percentages then decreased and Artemisia became codominant, suggesting drier and perhaps colder conditions from similar to 21 to similar to 15 cal ka, when Lake Bonneville was at or near its highest levels. Lake Bonneville declined to a low level by similar to 13 cal ka, while Pinus pollen percentages increased, indicating that conditions remained cooler and moister than today. During the Younger Dryas interval, the brief Gilbert episode rise in lake level was followed by a shallow lake with a stratified water column. This lake rise occurred as Pinus pollen percentages were declining and those of Artemisia were rising (reflecting increasingly dry conditions), after which Artemisia pollen was at very high levels (suggesting cold and dry conditions) for a brief period. Since similar to 10.6 cal ka lacustrine conditions have resembled those of present-day GSL. Pollen spectra for the period from similar to 10.6 to 7.2 cal ka have low levels of conifer pollen and high (for the Holocene) levels of desert and steppe taxa, suggesting generally dry conditions with maximum aridity occurring prior to the deposition of the Mazama tephra (similar to 7.6 cal ka). After similar to 10.6 cal ka, Juniperus pollen percentages began to increase and by similar to 7.2 cal ka juniper woodlands were well established on lower mountain slopes. From similar to 7 to 4 cal ka, pollen percentages fluctuated near their mean values for the entire Holocene. The neopluvial (similar to 4 to 2 cal ka) was the wettest part of the Holocene, with higher levels of Juniperus pollen and lower levels for steppe and desert taxa than in older Holocene sediments. Pollen percentages for the last similar to 2 cal ka are variable, but generally indicate a return to drier conditions.

SUBSURFACE SEDIMENTS	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												During the summer of 1990, 12 gravity cores were collected in Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho at various depths and in a variety of depositional environments. All core subsamples were analysed to determine the bulk sediment chemistry; selected subsamples were analysed for trace element partitioning and Cs-137 activity. The purpose of these analyses was to determine the trace element concentrations and distributions in the sediment column and to try to establish a trace element geochemical history of the lake in relation to mining and mining-related discharge operations in the area. Substantial portions of the near-surface sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene are markedly enriched in Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn, and slightly enriched in Cu, Fe and Mn. Variations in the thickness of the trace element-rich sediments, which range from more than 119 cm to as little as 17 cm, indicate that the source of much of this material is the Coeur d'Alene River. An estimated 75 million tonnes of trace element-rich sediments have been deposited on or in the lake bed. Estimated trace element masses in excess of those considered representative of background conditions range from a high of 468 000 tonnes of Pb to a low of 260 tonnes of Hg. The similarity between the trace element-rich surface and subsurface sediments with respect to their location, their bulk chemistry, their interelement relations and their trace element partitioning indicate that the sources and/or concentrating mechanisms causing the trace element enrichment in the lake sediments have probably been the same through-out their depositional history. Based on a Mt St Helens' ash layer from the 1980 eruption, ages estimated from Cs-137 activity and the presence of 80 discernible and presumably annual layers in a core collected near the Coeur d'Alene River delta indicate that deposition rates for the trace element-rich sediments have ranges from 2.1 to 1.3 cm/year. These data also indicate that the deposition of trace element-rich sediments began, at least in the Coeur d'Alene River delta, some time between 1895 and 1910, dates consistent with the onset of mining and ore processing activities that began in the area in the 1880s.																			0885-6087					JAN	1995	9	1					35	54		10.1002/hyp.3360090105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360090105													WOS:A1995QL75000004
J	Heusser, CJ; Heusser, LE; Peteet, DM				Heusser, CJ; Heusser, LE; Peteet, DM			Humptulips revisited: a revised interpretation of Quaternary vegetation and climate of western Washington, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												New pollen data from a 770-cm core of a mire at Humptulips on the southwestern Olympic Peninsula (47 degrees 17'00"N, 123 degrees 54'40"W) and from a nearby deposit regarded as interglacial in age on the West Fork of the Humptulips River provide evidence for a reinterpretation of previous accounts of the Quaternary vegetation and climate. Using a new age model, the highly variable record at Humptulips is here correlated with marine oxygen-isotope stages (OIS) 1-5a. Vegetation during OIS 5a was pine-dominated, mixed woodland and tundra. In OIS 4, 3, and 2, oscillations in pollen assemblages imply repeated intervals of mountain hemlock parkland and tundra. Pine, as an indicator of openness, is also abundant in these stages. Interstadial fluctuations in OIS 3 reflect episodes of lowland western hemlock communities. The earliest of the episodes is of infinite radiocarbon age and the latest dates to approximately 30,000 C-14 yr B.P Parkland in OIS 2, occurring after 24,600 until at least 18,440 C-14 yr B.P., was replaced by transitional pine-alder in OIS 1 (Holocene), which, unlike any of the earlier stages, conveys the development of modem lowland forest dominated by western hemlock. Pollen assemblages over the length of record imply that temperature and humidity at no time were as high as at present; only in OIS 3 do conditions approach those occurring in OIS 1. During OIS 2, 3, and 4, when tree line apparently stood at the location of the site, climate was colder and drier. Temperatures were depressed an estimated greater than or equal to 5 degrees C with precipitation close to 1000 mm compared with 2000-3000 mm at present. Atmospheric circulation during OIS 2 appears to have been much controlled by the location of the Laurentide ice sheet in the continental interior, whereas under the current climatic regime beginning in the early Holocene, westerly air flow has dominated, regulated by interplay between the North Pacific high in summer and the wintertime Aleutian low.

In this study, we performed three-dimensional laboratory experiments to investigate the saltwater intrusion dynamics in estuarine aquifers under tidal conditions. Fully-coupled numerical models were constructed considering surface water-groundwater interactions and tidal fluctuations. The simulations were used to interpret the experimental observations and to investigate the sensitivities of tidal amplitude and aquifer hydraulic conductivity on saltwater intrusion with an extended model size. Our results show that flow and salt transport in estuarine aquifer is significantly influenced by the interactions between the river water and groundwater at different tidal stages. At high tide, saltwater rapidly enters into the river channel and penetrates into the upstream aquifer driven by density gradient. At this time, flow is converged from the aquifer to the river close to the sea boundary and dispersed from the river to the aquifer at the inland side. At low tide, inland freshwater flushes the river and leads to the retreat of the salt. Yet, since the flow velocity in the aquifer is very slow, salt in the aquifer is not completely flushed out but accumulated. The flow in the aquifer is focused into the river at the inland side and defocused close to the sea boundary. The salt flux quantification indicates a net salt flux from the river and sea to the aquifer at high tide and a remarkable discharge to the sea at low tide and falling mid-tide. Both saltwater intrusion area and mass in the aquifers evidence a much stronger saltwater intrusion degree in estuarine aquifers in comparison to the classical coastal seawater intrusion without river. Furthermore, a higher tidal amplitude or a larger hydraulic conductivity result to a more significant saltwater intrusion in estuarine aquifers. The former contradicts to the trend observed in the classical coastal seawater intrusion without river due to the additional path of groundwater salinization the river offered in estuarine systems.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2025	659								133281	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133281		APR 2025											WOS:001470219600001

Deep desert aquifers as an archive for Mid- to Late Pleistocene hydroclimate: An example from the southeastern Mediterranean	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many efforts have been made to illuminate the nature of past hydroclimates in semi-arid and arid regions, where current and future shifts in water availability have enormous consequences on human subsistence. Deep desert aquifers, where groundwater is stored for prolonged periods, might serve as a direct record of major paleorecharge events. To date, groundwater-based paleoclimate reconstructions have mainly focused on a relatively narrow timescale (up to similar to 40 kyr), limited by the relatively short half-life of the widely used radiocarbon (5.73 kyr). Here we demonstrate the usage of deep regional aquifers in the arid southeastern Mediterranean as a hydroclimate archive for earlier Mid-to-Late Pleistocene epochs. State-of-the-art dating tools, primarily the Kr-81 radioisotope (t(1/2) = 229 kyr), were combined with other atmosphere-derived tracers to illuminate the impact of four distinguishable wetter episodes over the past 400 kyr, with differences in climatic conditions and paleorecharge locations. Variations in stable water isotope composition suggest moisture transport from more proximal (Mediterranean) and distal (Atlantic) sources to different parts of the region at distinct times. Large variability in the computed noble gas-based recharge temperature (NGT), ranging similar to 15-30 degrees C, cannot be explained by climate variations solely, and points to different recharge pathways, including geothermal heating in the deep unsaturated zone and recharge from high-elevation (colder) regions. The obtained groundwater record complements and enhances the interpretation of other terrestrial archives in the arid region, including a contribution of valuable information regarding the moisture source origin as reflected in the deuterium-excess values, which is unattainable from the common practice analysis of calcitic cave deposits. We conclude that similar applications in other deep (hundred-m-order) regional groundwater systems (e.g., the Sahara desert aquifers) can significantly advance our understanding of long-term (up to 1 Myr) paleo-hydroclimate in arid regions, including places where no terrestrial remnants, such as cave, lake, and spring sediments, are available.					; Lu, Zheng-Tian/G-1131-2017; Mueller, Peter/AAC-7708-2022; Yechieli, Yoseph/ABA-5546-2020; Aeschbach, Werner/C-1026-2008; Solomon, Douglas/C-7951-2016; Armon, Moshe/GWQ-4177-2022	Seltzer, Alan/0000-0003-2870-1215; Ram, Roi/0000-0002-6046-2093; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2024	951								175737	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175737		AUG 2024						39187079					WOS:001313579100001
J	ROGNON, P; WILLIAMS, MAJ				ROGNON, P; WILLIAMS, MAJ			LATE QUATERNARY CLIMATIC CHANGES IN AUSTRALIA AND NORTH AFRICA - PRELIMINARY INTERPRETATION	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Geological and biological data for the period 0-40,000 B.P. suggest that variations in precipitation and evaporation along the temperate and tropical margins of Australia and North Africa are closely related to variations in the position and strength of the subtropical anticyclones. Such changes in the subtropical anticyclones seem related to changes in the position and wave amplitude of the subtropical westerly jet stream. A dynamic interpretation of the inferred palaeoclimates suggests that important additional factors were the distribution of surface temperature anomalies over Siberia and the Sahara at 30,000 B.P.; the location of North Pacific and North American surface temperature anomalies at 24,000 B.P.; compression of the westerlies over Tasmania during 20,000-15,000 B.P.; breakdown of the summer monsoon during 17,000-12,000 B.P.; and a possible change in the slope and nature of the Intertropical Convergence during 11,000-7000 B.P. Major environmental changes associated with the above influences were heavy rainfall, high lake levels, and increased fluvial activity in southern Australia and along both margins of the Sahara between 40,000 and 20,000 B.P.; low lake levels in the Afar at 30,000 B.P.; intertropical aridity and dune-building along the tropical margins of the Sahara and Australia, and desiccation in semi-arid New South Wales during the interval 17,000-12,000 B.P.; and very high lake levels and increased precipitation in the Sahel and in northern and southern Australia from 11,000-5000 B.P. The past and present sole of the desert anticyclones in controlling the start and the close of the arid phases is demonstrated, as is the correlation between Southern Hemisphere pressure systems and Saharan rainfall, and between Northern Hemisphere circulation changes and Australian rainfall. The subtropical anticyclones may act as buffers when the thermal balance between the 2 hemispheres is upset by an excess of surface ice in either hemisphere, and this influences the climate well beyond the deserts.																			0031-0182	1872-616X					1977	21	4					285	327		10.1016/0031-0182(77)90040-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(77)90040-2													WOS:A1977DG69100004

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its biota is represented by unique fauna and flora, with endemics accounting for more than 60%. What is happening in the Baikal ecosystem in recent decades due to global climate change and anthropogenic impacts? In this paper, we studied this issue on the example of one of the few open bays on the western shore of Lake Baikal, as well as of some remote areas. It has been found that the plankton composition is dominated by thermophilic species; the role of endemic species in the formation of total biomass is decreasing, which confirms the ecosystem's response to climate warming. As a result of human activity, filamentous algae bloom suppresses endemic algae species and reduces mollusk proportion. The coastal zone of Lake Baikal is taking on the features of common shallow freshwater lakes due to the predominance of cosmopolitan and widespread Palearctic species. It is necessary to monitor the Baikal ecosystem in the changing climate and to strengthen control over human activities on the shores of the lake. Recent studies have revealed how the freshwater biota of Lake Baikal responds to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. We studied phyto- and zooplankton, as well as phyto- and zoobenthos, in the open coastal waters of the southern basin of the lake and of Listvennichny Bay. A total of 180 aquatic organism taxa were recorded. The response of the Baikal ecosystem to climate change can be traced by changes in the species composition of planktonic communities of the lake's open coasts in summer. The key species were thermophilic the Anabaena lemmermannii P. Richt. (F-ij = +0.7) blue-green algae, the Asplanchna priodonta Gosse (F-ij = +0.6) rotifers in 2016, the Rhodomonas pusilla (Bachm.) Javorn. (F-ij = +0.5) cold-loving algae, and the Cyclops kolensis Lilljeborg (F-ij = +0.9) copepods in the past century. The proportion of Chlorophyta decreased from 63% to 17%; the Cyanophyta increased from 3% to 11% in the total biomass of phytoplankton; and the proportion of Cladocera and Rotifera increased to 26% and 11% in the biomass of zooplankton, respectively. Human activity makes an additional contribution to the eutrophication of coastal waters. The Dinobryon species, the cosmopolitan Asterionella formosa Hass. and Fragilaria radians Kutz., dominated phytoplankton, and filamentous algae, Spirogyra, dominated at the bottom in the area with anthropogenic impact. The trophic level was higher than at the unaffected background site: the saprobity index varied from 1.45 to 2.17; the ratio of eutrophic species to oligotrophic species ranged from 1:2 to 3:1, and the ratio of mesosaprobiont biomass to endemics biomass ranged from 2:1 to 7:1. Currently, the boundaries of eutrophication zones of shallow waters in Lake Baikal are expanding, and its coastal zone has acquired features typical of freshwater bodies of the eutrophic type.					; Kravtsova, Lyubov/J-3365-2018; Минчева, Елена/AAQ-1666-2020	Nebesnyh, Ivan/0000-0001-5961-0514; Kravtsova, Lyubov/0000-0003-0862-4726; Onishchuk, Natalya/0000-0001-8496-2757; 														2079-7737				SEP	2021	10	9							904	10.3390/biology10090904	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10090904								34571780					WOS:000699144800001

However, the solute sources and the provenance of B in the TTR are still unclear, which significantly hinders a deeper understanding of the source-sink processes of the boron deposits in the QB. In this study, water samples were collected from tributaries, mainstreams, mud volcanoes, hot springs, and rainwater in the TTR area. Through hydrochemical analysis, forward modeling, and B isotope geochemistry methods, combined with the previous research results, some findings were obtained. The hydrochemical type of TTR is Ca-Mg-Cl, and the major mechanism of controlling chemical composition is rock weathering. The solute sources in the TTR are mainly from dissolution of evaporites (75.9%), atmospheric precipitation (20.8%), and a minor contribution from carbonates (3.1%) and silicates weathering (0.6%). The higher B content (0.89-4.30 mg/L, mean = 2.13 mg/L) and lower delta 11B value (0.79 parts per thousand-4.71 parts per thousand, mean = 4.17 parts per thousand) of the TTR indicate that the B sources are mainly from mixture of mud volcanic waters (56.19-199.98 mg/L, mean = 113.51 mg/L, - 1.26 parts per thousand-2.22 parts per thousand, mean = 0.85 parts per thousand) in the upper reaches, and the deep groundwater near the Indosinian granite in the lower reaches. The significant difference in boron resources between the two lakes may be due to the enrichment of B in the late Pleistocene in the DQSL, which received exceptionally rich soluble B carried by the ancient TTR during an active tectonic period, while the weakening of tectonic activity and the diversion of the ancient TTR resulted in the supply of B with significantly reduced content to the XQSL. These results are helpful for a deeper understanding of the ore-forming mechanisms of the boron deposits in salt lake.

J	Frohlich, RK; Barosh, PJ; Boving, T				Frohlich, Reinhard K.; Barosh, Patrick J.; Boving, Thomas			Investigating changes of electrical characteristics of the saturated zone affected by hazardous organic waste	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The Picillo Farm, EPA Superfund Site, in western Rhode Island was an unauthorized disposal site of hazardous organic chemicals. Predominantly organic contaminants have entered an aquifer comprised of layered glacial deposits and fractured bedrock and spread past the site boundaries with groundwater flow. Hydraulic conductivities in the glacial deposits range over two orders of magnitude and fractures and faults in the granitic bedrock further complicate the spreading of contaminants. Monitoring wells delineate two plumes that extend towards a fault-controlled valley with lakes and wetlands; one to the northwest and the other to the southwest. In this investigation we studied the electrical characteristics of both plumes. One dimensional Schlumberger depth soundings were conducted along several profile lines over the plumes and compared to those over non-contaminated sections of the site. With regard to the southwestern plume, high formation factors (ratio of bulk layer to pore water resistivity) between 12 and 45 were observed compared to values between 2.5 and 7.7 measured over the non-contaminated sections. Also, high values (>5) of vertical electrical anisotropy (ratio of geoelectrically determined depth to high resistivity bedrock to drilled depth to bedrock) were measured over the contaminated part of the site. These values are extremely high compared to other non-contaminated sites (range: 2 to 3) in glacial stream channels of southern Rhode Island. Geoelectric measurements were affected by lateral effects. However, the consistency of high formation factors (I I to 3 5) and high vertical anisotropies (3 to 5) over the southwestern plume in comparison to low formation factors (3 to 8) and vertical anisotropies (I to 1.5) over non-contaminated sites represents a marked difference between both sites. Overall, the Schlumberger depth soundings are less susceptible to near-surface lateral inhomogeneities than expected from other geoelectrical methods. Also, the disadvantage of a 1D interpretation was compensated by estimating resistivity and thickness ranges within the concept of non-uniqueness using the Dar Zarrouk parameters (Maillet, R., 1947. The fundamental equations of electrical prospecting. Geophysics, 12(4): 529-556.). The results over the northwestern plume, i.e. an area with higher contaminant concentration than the southwestern plume, were mixed and showed no consistent trends. Predominantly reducing conditions, as indicated by the presence of soluble ferric (Fell) iron hydroxides in ground water samples, increased the electrical conductivity.

J	BALL, E; GLUCKSMAN, J				BALL, E; GLUCKSMAN, J			LIMNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF LAKE WISDOM, A LARGE NEW-GUINEA CALDERA LAKE WITH A SIMPLE FAUNA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Lake Wisdom is of interest because it is large and deep, has O2 throughout, and yet, apparently as a result of its recent formation, its biota has some surprising lacunae. It is nearly circular and fills the central caldera of Long Island, Papua New Guinea (5.degree.20''S, 147.degree.6''E). Its maximum length is 13.4 km, and area approximately 95 km2. A bathymetric map of the lake to depths of 300 m was constructed from fathometer transects. Repeated soundings in the deeper parts gave depths of about 360 m. The surface of the lake is approximately 190 m above sea level and water samples from the deepest part of the lake are fresh, so the basin is apparently sealed. The lake level shows annual fluctuations of about 1.0 m. Limnological information was collected during 7 visits to Lake Wisdom over the period 1969-1976. The surface temperature of the lake was constant at 28.degree. C throughout this period and the temperature falls very gradually to 26-27.degree. C at 60 m, except for a relatively rapid drop of approximately 1.degree. C from 10-20 m. One of the most unusual features is the relatively high O2 concentration in the deepest parts of the lake. Living chironomid larvae and mollusks were collected from the bottom in depths of 360 m. Light penetration in the lake varies greatly depending on the amount of rainfall and the volcanic activity of Motmot, a secondary cone within the lake. The biota of Lake Wisdom is rather simple. There is a low standing crop of phytoplankton. Benthic algae are abundant and diverse although they cover only a limited area because of the depth of the lake. There are no vascular aquatic plants. The pelagic fauna consists of 2 spp. of Cladocera and 1 spp. of notonectid. There is 1 sp. of sponge, 4 spp. of mollusks, and a small number of species of aquatic insects including Hemiptera, Odonata and the larvae of chironomids, mayflies, a caddisfly and a pyralid moth. Water birds, including ducks, grebes and waders, are fairly numerous. The lake also contains 1 or more crocodiles.

The project goal is to develop cost and performance data of the treatment approach for potential application in long-term water treatment/management activities at the Gilt Edge site, as well as potential application at other similar sites. The Anchor Hill Pit initially contained approximately 265 000 m(3) of acidic mine water, with elevated metals, sulfate, and nitrate content and a pH of approximately 3. The first step of the two-stage in situ treatment consisted of using a Neutra-Mill (developed in Australia, licensed to Shepherd-Miller, Inc. in US.) to neutralize the pit pH to approximately 7 using lime, accomplished between late March and early May 2001. After a stabilization period, a patented process for in situ pit lake treatment using an organic formulation of molasses, methanol, and proprietary ingredients was implemented in the pit by Green World Science, Inc. in late May 2001 to create reducing conditions; stimulate bacterial activity for nitrate, selenium, and sulfate reduction; improve water quality; and create a stable system. Additional neutralizing reagent was added in September 2002. Additional organic dosages have occurred in October 2001, April 2002, and September 2002. As of June 2003, bacterial activity has reduced nitrate concentrations to non-detectable levels and bacterial sulfate reduction has been initiated, with associated decreases in metals concentrations. The pit lake has become a meromictic lake with a chemocline at a depth of approximately 10 meters. Quarterly monitoring of pit water quality and annual monitoring of pit sediment is ongoing, and is planned to continue through the summer of 2003. This paper will describe project activities, results, and lessons-learned to-date as well as future plans. The MWTP is funded by the US. EPA and is jointly administered by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under DOE contract number DEAC22-96EW96405.																					90-5809-593-2				2003							345	357																WOS:000186710100042

Lh & ugrave;'& agrave;& agrave;n M & acirc;n' (Kluane Lake), located in southwestern Yukon, is a region of frequent dust activity. In 2016, the lake level fell due to a dramatic decrease in inflow from glacier meltwater, and the delta of the lake became an important source of dust to surrounding ecosystems. To determine the impacts of dust deposition on vegetation and soil trace element concentrations and characteristics, we sampled the lichen Peltigera canina and soil layers at 57 sites along a deposition gradient located 1.4-33.6 km downwind from the principal dust source. Arsenic, Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb in lichens were negatively correlated with the distance away from the dust source, with the highest correlations in Ni and Pb (r2 = 0.50 and 0.48, respectively). Lichen and tree abundances were negatively impacted by dust deposition, suggesting that dust can affect ecosystem vegetation composition. Starting 8 km away from the dust source, the concentrations of As, Ni, and Pb decreased by more than 50% per km, while Cd and Cu concentrations decreased by more than 40% per km. Overall, within the sampled ecosystems, soil pH is 1.4 times higher in the first 8 km from the dust source while carbon content and nutrients are lower, which implies changes in nutrient availability and cycling in dust-affected ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The delta of Lhuaan Man' (Kluane Lake), located in south west Yukon and on the traditional lands of Kluane First Nation, Champagne-Aishihik First Nation, and White River First Nation, is an are a where dust often settles and climate change has accelerated the melting of glaciers since the last iceage. Due to reduced glacier water flowing into the lake, the sediments in the delta are more exposed to wind, creating dust storms. To understand the impacts of dust deposition with in the surrounding ecosystems, we assessed the levels of trace metals in lichens and soils across a gradient from the delta to the lake. We found that distance from the dust source affected trace metal concentration sinlichens, surfacesoils, and vegetation. It is essential to understand how these metals spread as they can be potentially toxic and harmful to ecosystems and humans.

J	Green, PF				Green, PF			Early Tertiary paleo-thermal effects in Northern England: reconciling results from apatite fission track analysis with geological evidence	TECTONOPHYSICS					9th International Conference on Fission Track Dating and Thermochronology	FEB 06-11, 2000	LOME, AUSTRALIA					The Paleozoic Lake District Block in northwest England has traditionally been thought of as tectonically stable since the Late Paleozoic, receiving only small thicknesses of Late Palcozoic to Mesozoic cover (although some workers have put forward different views). Apatite fission track analysis (AFTA) data from outcrop samples across the region reveal Early Tertiary paleotemperatures around 100 degreesC, requiring kilometre-scale Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic cover, removed during Tertiary uplift and erosion. With no evidence for elevated basal heat flow in NW England during, the Early Tertiary, and no a priori justification for invoking it, earlier studies favoured an explanation involving burial by up to 3 km of overburden removed during Tertiary uplift and erosion. This conclusion was met with scepticism by many workers, and provoked a range of comments and criticisms, with a variety of alternative interpretations put forward, although these are also open to criticism. Results from the West Newton-1 hydrocarbon exploration well on the northern flank of the Lake District gave the first indication of a possibly more realistic interpretation, involving a combination of elevated heat flow and more restricted burial, but some aspects of the interpretation of these data were equivocal. More detailed sampling was therefore undertaken, in order to shed more light on the origin of the elevated Early Tertiary paleotemperatures observed across NW England. New AFTA data in outcrop samples from different elevations around Sea Fell (characterised by the highest elevations in the Lake District with the summit of Scafell Pike at 978 in asl) define an Early Tertiary paleogeothermal gradient of 61 degreesC/km, and require around 700 m of section removed from the summit during Tertiary uplift and erosion. These results, together with those from the West Newton-1 well, provide strong support for an interpretation involving Early Tertiary paleogeothermal gradients between 50% and 100% higher than present-day values, providing clear evidence of elevated basal heat flow during the Early Tertiary, contrary to earlier assumptions. Combined with amounts of section removed during Tertiary exhumation varying between similar to 0.7 km (from mountain peaks) and similar to 1.5-2 km (from coastal plains and glacial valleys near sea level) over the region, this interpretation finally provides a geologically plausible mechanism for the origin of the observed Early Tertiary paleo-thermal effects in NW England.

Wolong Lake is located in boundary of Liaoning, Jilin and Inner Mongolia Province, and closed to Horqin sandy land. It is the second largest fresh water lake in northeast China, which is important node for eastern Asia bird migration and for migratory bird propagation in summer. It is the important ecological security strategy node in Liaoning Province and even in Northeast China for the ecological security effect of sand fixation, freshwater supply, birds conservation, etc. It has some practical significance for the study of lake and estuary landscape ecological planning in small town of Northeast China, especially for the the green infrastructure planning. Wolong Lake is located in Kangping County of Shenyang, Liaoning Province. The ecological environment of Wolong Lake has been badly damaged, so that the ecological security protection foundation is weak. The water is insufficient in water system; Biological habitat with birds as the core has been damaged by human activities; Constructions of city and town are lack of positive interaction with biological environment of lake area; the degree of regional ecosystem network is low, and there is lack of construction in different degree. According to the existing problems of ecological system in Wolong lake area, main influence factors of Wolong Lake are analyzed in this paper. In the Green Infrastructure Planning of Wolong Lake, the green infrastructure network construction based on protection of lake overall protection is planned to solve the influence of diffuse pollution, point pollution and natural factor. Meanwhile, the Green Infrastructure Planning of Wolong Lake emphasizes the application of ecological technology in the green infrastructure solutions planning, and focus on the improvement of water self-purification, hydraulic circulating and wind energy utilization through the technology of constructed wetland, natural rainwater collection system, ecological revetment and floating island, tower eco-filter, wind energy pump, etc.					Wang, Yuncai/W-8509-2019														1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						3947	3952		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.3947	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.3947													WOS:000333767501275
J	Tripoli, GJ				Tripoli, GJ			Numerical study of the 10 January 1998 lake-effect bands observed during Lake-ICE	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This paper presents the results of a series of idealized cloud resolving simulations of the evolution of moist roll convection observed as part of the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) that took place during the 1997/98 winter over central Lake Michigan. Satellite and radar observations of the roll convection depict striking linear rolls stretching from 10 km off the western shore of the lake, across to the eastern shore, and then continuing across Michigan. The spacing of the primary rolls was observed to be 6 km, giving a ratio of spacing to depth of about 5:1, which is consistent with theory. In addition, a longer wavelength (13 km) of stationary banding was observed parallel to the shoreline. In an earlier study of this case, multiply nested simulations of the convective rolls based on real data variable initialization were successful in producing banded structures with similar spacing and location over the water to those observed using fine grid resolution of about 500 m. Unfortunately, the initial locations of simulated bands were organized primarily by numerical effects of grid interpolation. This suggested that the spacing of the bands was robust, but that their initial location was highly sensitive to subtle systematic forcings. In this paper, a set of idealized model experiments, designed to isolate the role that physically realistic local forcing plays in the organization of the rolls, was performed. Because externally generated upstream turbulence was suppressed in these tests so as not to bias the result, the generation of rolls was delayed until 20-30 km downwind of the observed location and the location simulated in the previous grid nesting experiments. It was shown that the subtle effects of the shoreline geometry were sufficient to spawn a near-surface streamwise vorticity that became the primary seed for roll development at the most efficient mode of roll convection. These results suggest that previous structures evolved in the upstream shear-driven land-based mixed layer were likely also important in determining where the nonlocal overturning was first triggered. It is not clear from these results whether the shear-driven structures that evolved over the land also played a significant role in organizing the structural geometry of the lake rolls. Results also suggested that the shore parallel bands were a robust feature of the atmospheric structure resulting from resonant gravity wave trapping in the frontal layer.																			0022-4928					SEP	2005	62	9					3232	3249		10.1175/JAS3462.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS3462.1													WOS:000232275300013
J	Rogers, DB; Dreiss, SJ				Rogers, DB; Dreiss, SJ			Saline groundwater in Mono basin, California .2. Long-term control of lake salinity by groundwater	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Mono Lake is a perennial, closed-basin lake that has existed for at least 700 kyr. This 46-m-deep alkaline lake's present concentration is about 90,000 ppm total dissolved solids. Well logs show that beneath part of the lake, saline groundwater of concentration >18,000 ppm extends to the bottom of the basin fill aquifer (Rogers and Dreiss, this issue), Numerical simulations indicate that redistribution of the basin's solutes between the lake and underlying saline groundwater body, driven by late Quaternary lake level changes, may be responsible for the high present-day solute content of Mono Lake. At low lake levels, the high lake concentration causes solute loss via free convection; this might occur more rapidly through faults or fractures. The saline-fresh groundwater interface position reflects a balance between the saline groundwater density and the force of inflowing fresh groundwater discharging near the shoreline. At higher lake stages, the shoreline discharge zone moves toward the basin edge, and the unrestrained saline groundwater mass subsides, drawing solutes from the lake into the basin sediments. Falling lake levels again constrict the saline groundwater beneath the lake, forcing saline water into the lake and increasing its solute content, The sediment permeability below the lake is the major control on the solute transfer rate between the lake and the groundwater reservoir. Only the larger, longer-term lake stage changes cause saline groundwater movement; depending on the assumed basin fill aquifer permeability, equilibration of the saline groundwater and lake solute content with lake stage changes requires hundreds to thousands of years. Simulations suggest that the historical conditions, where a more saline Mono Lake (50,000-90,000 ppm) overlies less concentrated groundwater (apparently similar to 18,000 ppm), could be due to the still present impact of late Pleistocene lake high stands. Mono Lake's historical salinity data have a large scatter, but suggest a 5% decrease in the lake's solute content over the last 50 years, We estimated the diffusive solute flux into lacustrine sediments for this period from core data. The salinity data are consistent with a combination of solute diffusion into sediments and an equal, or greater, model-predicted advective solute loss to groundwater.																			0043-1397					DEC	1995	31	12					3151	3169		10.1029/95WR02109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR02109													WOS:A1995TK64700024

Lake Victoria is the second largest lake in the world and the largest tropical lake. Bordered by Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, it provides a livelihood for millions of Africans in the region. However, the lake is under threat from eutrophication, a huge decline in the number of native fish species caused by several factors including loss of biodiversity, over fishing and pollution has been recently documented. Increasing usage of pesticides and insecticides in the adjacent agricultural areas as well as mercury contamination from processing of gold ore on the southern shores are currently considered among the most emergent phenomena of chemical contamination in the lake. By the application of globally consistent and comprehensive geospatial data-sets based on remote sensing integrated with information on heavy metals accumulation and insecticides exposure in native and alien fish populations, the present study aims at assessing the environmental risk associated to the contamination of the Lake Victoria water body on fish health, land cover distribution, biodiversity and the agricultural area surrounding the lake. By the elaboration of Landsat 7 TM data of November 2002 and Landsat 7 TM 1986 we have calculated the agriculture area which borders the Lake Victoria bay, which is an upland plain. This process has greatly enhanced nutrient loading to the soil, which is subsequently transported to the lake by rain or as dry fall. All the data has been insert in the Geographical information System (ARCGIS) to be upgraded and consulted. Heavy metals in fish fillets showed concentrations rather low except for mercury being higher than others as already described in previous investigations. In the same tissue, cholinesterases activity (ChE) as an indicator of insecticides exposure showed significant differences among fish species in both activity and sensitivity of selected inhibitor insecticides. This integrated approach aims at identifying and quantifying selected aquatic environmental issues which integrated with monitoring techniques such as contaminant concentrations and biological responses to insecticides exposure in fish populations will provide a scientific basis for aquatic zones management and assist in policy formulations at the national and international levels.

Typical conditions include water, pH=10, titration alkalinity >300 mM, osmolality=525 mOsm, temperatures ranging from 23degrees to 42degreesC, and O-2 levels fluctuating diurnally between extreme hyperoxia and anoxia. A number of relatively small tilapia populations are present in various thermal spring lagoons around the margin of the lake separated by kilometers of solid trona crust (floating Na2CO3) underlain by anoxic water. Despite the apparent isolation of different populations, annual floods may provide opportunities for exchange of fish across the surface of the trona and subsequent gene flow. To assess the question of isolation among Lake Magadi populations, we analyzed the variable control region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from six lagoons. A total of seven mtDNA haplotypes, including three common haplotypes, were observed in all six populations. Several of the Lake Magadi populations showed haplotype frequencies indicative of differentiation, while others showed very little. However, differentiation among lagoon populations was discordant with their geographical distribution along the shoreline. All populations exhibited the unusual trait of 100% ureotelism but specialized morphological and physiological characteristics were observed among several of the lagoon systems. In addition, distinct differences were observed in the osmolality among the lagoons with levels as high as 1,400-1,700 mOsm kg(-1), with corresponding differences in the natural levels of whole-body urea. These levels of osmotic pressure proved fatal to fish from less alkaline systems but remarkably were also fatal to the fish that inhabited lagoons with this water chemistry. Upon more detailed inspection, specific adaptations to differential conditions in the lagoon habitat were identified that allowed survival of these cichlids. Additional evidence against potential for gene flow among lagoons despite the sharing of common mtDNA haplotypes was that the osmolality of floodwaters following a heavy rain showed lethal levels exceeding 1,700 mOsm kg(-1). In isolation, different mtDNA haplotypes would be predicted to go to fixation in different populations due to rapid generation times and the small effective population sizes in a number of lagoons. We propose a model of balancing selection to maintain common mtDNA sequences through a common selection pressure among lagoons that is based on microhabitats utilized by the tilapia.					; Wood, Chris/C-3021-2009	Wood, Chris/0000-0002-9542-2219; 													1522-2152	1537-5293				JUL-AUG	2004	77	4					537	555		10.1086/422054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/422054								15449226					WOS:000224412700001
J	Derlet, RW; Richards, JR; Goldman, CR				Derlet, Robert W.; Richards, John R.; Goldman, Charles R.			Does Above-Normal Precipitation Reduce the Impact of Mountain Cattle Grazing on Watershed Algae and Bacteria?	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Cattle grazing is believed to have a harmful impact on high elevation Sierra Nevada mountain (Sierra) watersheds. During normal precipitation years, the prevalence of suspended stream and small lake aquatic coliforms and E. coli is significantly increased in cattle-grazed areas, and periphytic algae biomass is amplified. In addition, large numbers of E. coli are found attached to algae only in cattle-grazed areas. During 2011 the Sierra experienced 200 % above-normal precipitation, mostly as snow. Delayed snowmelt and higher volume stream flows provided a unique opportunity to determine if cattle grazing remained harmful to the aquatic environment. A total of 45 remote sites, including both lakes and streams, were sampled during the summer of 2011. Risk determinants for non-point pollution were divided into four categories: (1) cattle grazing areas (C), (2) recreation areas with predominant impact from pack animals (PA), (3) recreation areas used only by humans (H), and (4) remote wildlife areas (W). Algal biomass was accessed, and samples collected for taxonomy and analysis of microbes suspended or attached to algae. Ten species of algae were identified including Cladophora, Chlorella, Spirogyra, Zygnema, Ulothrix, and mixed Diatoms. Mean benthic coverage area of algae was 30 % at C sites compared to only 2 % at W sites (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of E. coli attached to algae was 90 % at C sites, 23 % at PA sites, 0 % at H sites and 0 % at W sites. Mean E. coli CFU/gm of algae found by pollution risk category was (x1000): C = 267 +/- 215.5, of sites at which suspended aquatic E. coli was detected (> 100 CFU/100 mL): C = 7 (70 %), and none at PA, H, and W sites (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The fecal indicator E. coli was detected suspended in water only in C areas. Significantly higher periphytic algal biomass and uniform presence of algae-attached E. coli was detected in C watersheds. The 200 % above-normal precipitation year did not decrease the impact of non-point pollution by cattle in the Sierra watershed.

J	Yang, ZR; Teller, JT				Yang, ZR; Teller, JT			Modeling the history of Lake of the Woods since 11,000 cal yr BP using GIS	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Because of differential isostatic rebound, many lakes in Canada have continued to change their extent and depth since retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Using GIS techniques, the changing configuration and bathymetry of Lake of the Woods in Ontario, Manitoba, and Minnesota were reconstructed for 12 points in time, beginning at 11,000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 9.6 C-14 ka B. P.), and were also projected 500 years into the future, based on the assumption that Lake of the Woods continued to have a positive hydrological budget throughout the Holocene. This modeling was done by first compiling a bathymetric database and merging that with subaerial data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). This DEM. le was then adjusted by: (1) isobase data derived from Lake Agassiz beaches prior to 9000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 8.1 C-14 ka B. P.) and (2) modeled isostatic rebound trend analysis after 9000 cal yr B. P. Just after the end of the Lake Agassiz phase of Lake of the Woods, only the northernmost part of the basin contained water. Differential rebound has resulted in increasing water depth. In the first 3000 years of independence from Lake Agassiz, the lake transgressed > 50 km to the south, expanding its area from 858 to 2857 km 2, and more than doubling in volume. Continued differential rebound after 6000 cal yr B. P. (similar to 5.2 14 C ka B. P.) has further expanded the lake, although today it is deepening by only a few cm per century at the southern end. In addition, climate change in the Holocene probably played a role in lake level fluctuations. Based on our calculation of a modern hydrological budget for Lake of the Woods, reducing runoff and precipitation by 65% and increasing evaporation from the lake by 40% would end overflow and cause the level of the lake to fall below the outlets at Kenora. Because this climate change is comparable to that recorded during the mid- Holocene warming across the region, it is likely that the area covered by the lake at this time would have been less than that determined from differential isostatic rebound alone.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				MAY	2005	33	4					483	498		10.1007/s10933-005-0813-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-0813-1													WOS:000229189000005

Studies carried out in the Potosi basin show that these formations were deposited within an almost continuous lacustrine system subjected to large variations in hydrology independent of any significant marine contribution. Thus, in addition to tectonic effects, the hydrology was mainly governed by changes in the evaporation/precipitation ratio. Major evaporitic phases took place during arid periods which caused the contraction of the lakes and induced the formation of sub-perennial to ephemeral residual brine ponds trapped in the deep part of the lacustrine system (upper Aroifilla, middle Chaunaca, Santa-Lucia Formations). The crystallization of evaporitic minerals occurred as subaqueous precipitation in brine sheets and as interstitial growth both in the dry peripheral mud hats and in the central area when the water table fell below the sediment surface. Although the evaporite mineral assemblage only includes calcium sulfate, it is likely that more soluble salts may have crystallized and subsequently underwent a partial or total dissolution. The source ions were the catchment basin rocks with a probable contribution of reduced sulfur compounds of volcanic origin. Wide Variations of water redox conditions are substantiated by the isotopic composition of the sulfates. During wetter periods (Chaunaca p.p., El Molino), the expansion of the lacustrine system induced perennial conditions with slightly saline to freshwater although episodic desiccations may have occurred. The sedimentation is therefore characterized by decreasing evaporitic influences, carbonate sedimentation (shell coquinas, oolite/oncolite deposits, stromatolitic and thrombolitic buildups, organic-rich laminated carbonates, etc) and, the diversification of the fauna and flora in the lake waters and near the shorelines. Toward the top of the Fl Molino Formation, episodic prevalence of sodic alkaline waters induced the formation of analcime-rich laminites. The rise of the lake level was responsible for the sporadic development of seaward outflows by which marine organisms may have entered into the lacustrine system. This late Cretaceous-early Tertiary continental domain was located in the subtropical belt where aridity and sub-desertic conditions alternated with more humid periods.

J	Lion, A				Lion, A			Thixotropic behaviour of rubber under dynamic loading histories: Experiments and theory	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS												In the first part of this essay we investigate the thermomechanical behaviour of carbon black-filled rubber under dynamic loading conditions. The loadings consist of static predeformations which are superimposed by small sinusoidal oscillations, The frequency was varied between 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz, the deformation amplitude between 0.006 and 0.06, the temperature between 253 K and 373 K and the storage and dissipation moduli measured. The data show that the frequency dependence of the moduli is of the power-law type. They also depend on the deformation amplitude and the temperature. If the temperature is constant, increasing amplitudes lead to decreasing moduli. As discussed by Payne (1965), this behaviour can be interpreted in terms of a thixotropic change. If, on the other hand, the deformation amplitude is kept constant, increasing temperature levels lead to decreasing moduli. In the second part of this work we develop a constitutive theory to represent the material behaviour observed. We consider the dissipation principle of thermodynamics and formulate the model for three-dimensional finite deformations. To describe thermal expansion effects, we decompose the deformation gradient into a thermal and a mechanical part as proposed by Lu and Pister (1975). We prescribe the thermal part by a constitutive function and assume the mechanical part to be the driving force for the stress tenser. As motivated in earlier works we split the total stress into an equilibrium stress and a rate-dependent overstress. We represent the equilibrium stress using a modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy function and the overstress by a series of Maxwell elements whose springs are of Neo-Hookean type. Both the kinematic tenson and the associated stress measures are defined by using the concept of dual variables proposed by Haupt and Tsakmakis (1989). In order to represent the thixotropic effects, the viscosities depend on the temperature and the deformation history. The history dependence is implied by an internal variable which is a measure for the deformation amplitude and has a relaxation property as discussed by Payne (1965); To determine the material parameters, we linearise the constitutive equations with respect to the static predeformation and lake the analytical solution for harmonic strain-controlled loadings into account. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the constitutive theory describes all phenomena experimentally observed with a fairly good approximation. The model is compatible with the second law of thermodynamics in the form of the Clausius Duhem inequality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

(i) Ecological connectivity is essential for the maintenance and support of migratory bird habitats. Enhancing control measures to expand ecological corridors can effectively safeguard flagship and umbrella species, thereby promoting biodiversity conservation. (ii) The establishment of ecological corridors can facilitate the reconciliation of conflicts between conservation efforts and development goals, thereby yielding significant theoretical implications for achieving a harmonious coexistence between humans and birds within the migratory bird sanctuary of Poyang Lake.Abstract Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity. However, the rapid expansion of urbanization and the intensification of human activities have significantly disrupted environmental integrity, leading to a continuous deterioration in both the quantity and quality of large ecological patches. This has further diminished the connectivity among ecological patches, leading to significant consequences for regional biodiversity conservation. Taking Poyang Lake as a case study, which serves as a crucial wintering habitat for migratory birds along the East Asia-Australasia flyway, this research employs ArcMap technology. It considers various factors including land use type, slope, and elevation to evaluate habitat quality and degradation through the application of the InVEST model. Additionally, the study utilizes the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model alongside circuit theory to delineate ecological corridors within the area and to establish a comprehensive ecological network system. The research results in this paper are as follows. (i) During the period from 2000 to 2020, there was an overall decline in habitat quality within the study area, indicating a clear trend of habitat degradation. However, it is worth noting that there was an increase in habitat quality in certain local areas within the protected area. (ii) The ecological resistance values in the core area of the migratory bird reserve in Poyang Lake are generally low. However, the ecological resistance values of the habitats have shown a consistent increase from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, there has been a significant decrease in the density of ecological corridors during this time period. (iii) Over the period from 2000 to 2020, both the number and connectivity of ecological corridors decreased and their integrity and functionality degraded. Consequently, this weakened role of the ecological network has had implications for maintaining regional biodiversity and ecosystem service functions. The findings indicate two conclusions. (i) Ecological connectivity is essential for the conservation of migratory bird habitats. Strengthening control measures aimed at expanding ecological corridors can effectively safeguard flagship and umbrella species, thereby promoting biodiversity conservation. (ii) The establishment of ecological corridors can help reconcile conflicts between conservation efforts and development objectives. This reconciliation carries significant theoretical implications for fostering a harmonious coexistence between humans and birds in Poyang Lake's migratory bird sanctuary.																				2079-7737				OCT	2024	13	10							786	10.3390/biology13100786	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology13100786								39452095					WOS:001342998400001

I. Vegetation, lake levels and geochemistry	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Palaeodata in synthesis form are needed as benchmarks for the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), Advances since the last synthesis of terrestrial palaeodata from the last glacial maximum (LGM) call for a new evaluation, especially of data from the tropics. Here pollen, plant-macrofossil, lake-level, noble gas (from groundwater) and delta(18)O (from speleothems) data are compiled for 18 +/- 2 ka (C-14), 32 degrees N-33 degrees S. The reliability of the data was evaluated using explicit criteria and some types of data were re-analysed using consistent methods in order to derive a set of mutually consistent palaeoclimate estimates of mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), mean annual temperature (MAT), plant available moisture (PAM) and runoff (P-E). Cold-month temperature (MAT) anomalies from plant data range from -1 to -2 K near sea level in Indonesia and the S Pacific, through -6 to -8 K at many high-elevation sites to -8 to -15K in S China and the SE USA. MAT anomalies from groundwater or speleothems seem more uniform (-4 to -6 K), but the data are as yet sparse; a clear divergence between MAT and cold-month estimates from the same region is seen only in the SE USA, where cold-air advection is expected to have enhanced cooling in winter. Regression of all cold-month anomalies against site elevation yielded an estimated average cooling of - 2.5 to - 3 K at modern sea level, increasing to approximate to - 6 K by 3000m. How ever, Neotropical sites showed larger than the average sea-level cooling (- 5 to - 6 K) and a non-significant elevation effect, whereas W and S Pacific sites showed much less sea-level cooling (- 1 K) and a stronger elevation effect. These findings support the inference that tropical sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were lower than the CLIMAP estimates, but they limit the plausible average tropical sea-surface cooling, and they support the existence of CLIMAP-like geographic patterns in SST anomalies. Trends of PAM and lake levels indicate wet LGM conditions in the W USA, and at the highest elevations, with generally dry conditions elsewhere. These results suggest a colder-than-present ocean surface producing a weaker hydrological cycle, more arid continents, and arguably steeper-than-present terrestrial lapse rates. Such linkages are supported by recent observations on freezing-level height and tropical SSTs, moreover, simulations of "greenhouse" and LGM climates point to several possible feedback processes by which low-level temperature anomalies might be amplified aloft.					; Hope, Geoffrey/O-2757-2019; Holmgren, Karin/HTT-0489-2023; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010; Bartlein, Patrick/E-4643-2011; Ramstein, Gilles/L-3328-2014; Farrera, Isabelle/JJE-0575-2023; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022; Cramer, Wolfgang/B-8221-2008; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011	Bush, Mark/0000-0001-6894-8613; Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Bartlein, Patrick/0000-0001-7657-5685; Cramer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9205-5812; Farrera, Isabelle/0000-0002-1210-5032; Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	1999	15	11					823	856		10.1007/s003820050317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003820050317													WOS:000083837000002

Distinct Hydrologic Pathways Regulate Perennial Surface Water Dynamics in a Hyperarid Basin	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In water-stressed hyperarid basins, questions mount over the impacts of anthropogenic groundwater extraction and climate-driven perturbations on groundwater-surface water interactions and the resilience of ecosystem-critical surface water. Coupling groundwater with surface water observations from Sentinel-2 data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate surface water connectivity with local aquifers following intense precipitation events in arid basins. Surface water area and groundwater level data were analyzed for trends following precipitation, including peak lag time, post-peak recession rates, and changes in hydraulic gradients. Results indicate variable connectivity following large precipitation events between surface water change and groundwater level fluctuations in the upgradient freshwater aquifer, whereas the downgradient brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer indicated virtually no connectivity with the aquifer. Comparison between precipitation and surface water response indicate distinct responses based on the physical relationship of the surface water body with the brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer. Lumped parameter modeling of surface water inundation also constrains the possible hydrologic dynamics of the post-precipitation response. While modeled influx to surface water seems primarily controlled by watershed hydraulics rather than direct hydraulic connectivity of the aquifers, the relationship between surface water and adjacent groundwater levels coupled with surface water area indicates that local aquifers are primarily connected to the surface water bodies through discharge via subsurface infiltration. Modeling results imply that the existence of brine-adjacent surface water in arid basins relies on upgradient discharge from freshwater aquifers. Our results further support that marginal surface water systems can serve as a critical recharge mechanism to local aquifers.Plain Language Summary Surface water is important for desert ecosystems, but the future of surface water remains uncertain because of climate change and human consumption. Understanding how surface water responds to precipitation and interacts with groundwater is useful for better predicting future water availability. Advancements in the quality of satellite imagery provide an opportunity to combine satellite data with rain gauge and water level data to investigate the connection of surface water to rainfall patterns and groundwater. Observations from flooding behavior show two different types of surface water. Both types can be categorized by proximity to the brine that exists in the aquifer underlying the basin floor: transitional pools occur at the edge of the transition to brine while terminal lagoon systems occur in the brackish groundwater zone. Calculations indicate that the two groups have different inflow and outflow mechanisms that occur over varying timescales. These mechanisms indicate that intense rainfall events will lead to increased inundation over longer periods of time for transitional surface water bodies. However, despite rapid rates of recession, terminal pools will also experience prolonged inundation above background levels for up to a year after large rainfall events because of increased spring discharge from rainfall-driven recharge to groundwater.					; Moran, Brendan/I-5147-2019; Moran, Brendan J./I-5147-2019; Boutt, David/G-1146-2010	Boutt, David/0000-0003-1397-0279; McKnight, Sarah/0000-0002-6013-193X; Moran, Brendan J./0000-0002-9862-6241; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2023	59	4							e2022WR034046	10.1029/2022WR034046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR034046													WOS:000973255800001

The lake is characterized by high nutrient levels, high turbidity caused by algae and resuspended sediments, and almost no remaining submersed or emergent macrophytic vegetation. Phosphorus loading to Lake Apopka is being reduced through the purchase of the riparian farms and restoration to aquatic habitat. Additional management activities to accelerate recovery of the lake are creation of a treatment wetland to remove nutrients and suspended solids from lake water, removal of gizzard shad(Dorosoma cepedianum), and replanting of littoral vegetation. Because of concerns that reduction in phosphorus (P) loading will be ineffective in restoration of Lake Apopka, we have reexamined the empirical and theoretical basis for P load reduction as a lake restoration technique. Case studies of control of P loading show that a proportional improvement in lake trophic condition often is obtained when a significant reduction in P loading is effected. Restoration of hypereutrophic, shallow, turbid lakes requires reduction in P loading to lower the stability of phytoplankton dominance and increase the stability of macrophyte dominance. Several characteristics of Lake Apopka increase the probability that the lake will respond to reduction in P loading from adjacent farms. First, P loading (approx. 0.55 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) to the lake during the last 30 years has been elevated about seven-fold compared to prefarming levels, and P loading is dominated by farm discharges. Second, biogeochemical processes will dampen internal loading from P-rich sediments after external loading is reduced. The majority of P enters the lake as soluble reactive P. However, as a result of chemical and biological processes, almost 80% of the P in surficial sediments is in Ca-Mg-bound (33%) or organic (46%) forms resistant to rapid biological uptake. Since summer 1995, trophic indicators (TP, TSS, Chi, Secchi depth) in Lake Apopka have improved significantly based on an Ii-year data set. These changes are consistent with modest reductions in P loading achieved since 1993 through regulatory actions. Recently, patches of submersed vegetation (e.g., Vallisneria, Chara) have established naturally at more than 20 sites around the lake.																					1-56670-331-X				1999							511	526																WOS:000080499000023

Late glacial and Holocene paleoenvironments in the midcontinent United States, inferred from Geneva Lake leaf wax, ostracode valve, and bulk sediment chemistry	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Geneva Lake in Wisconsin, USA, is > 20,000 years old and contains a 30-m thick lacustrine sediment record of mid-continent North American climate and environmental change. Here we describe a sediment record from Geneva Lake spanning the past 14,500 years. From scanning X-ray fluorescence, organic C and N concentrations and isotopes, X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and grain size of bulk sediments, we infer changes in sediment sources over time including: abrupt decline in inputs of remobilized loess similar to 13,400 cal yr BP followed by a gradual transition to organic-rich marl deposition by similar to 10,400 cal yr BP as the landscape stabilized following a period of permafrost thaw and vegetation development; deposition of a minerogenic unit at similar to 8,200 cal yr BP that may record enhanced eolian activity during the widespread "8.2 ka event; " and elevated zinc, lead, and arsenic from human activities following regional industrialization. Within the Holocene marl, we also use isotopic (delta O-18 and delta C-13) and trace metal ratio (Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) analyses of ostracode valves paired with concentrations and hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2) of leaf wax n-alkanes to infer climate and hydrological change. Groundwater had a large but declining influence on lake water chemistry from 11,800 to 9,700 cal yr BP, precluding inferences of regional climate from our lacustrine proxies during this period. d2H values of terrestrial n-C-29 alkanes show little variability from 9,700 to present, indicating the average isotopic composition of local precipitation was relatively stable, reflecting stable condensation temperatures and source. In contrast, a gradual trend towards more delta O-18-and delta H-2-depleted lake water and lower lake water Sr/Ca from 9700 cal yr BP to present suggest decreasing evaporation of lake water and increasing precipitation amounts throughout the Holocene and resulting shorter lake water residence times. Lake water Mg/Ca variations over the past 9,700 years broadly parallel regional pollen-based reconstructions of summer temperatures. Neither Mg/Ca nor terrestrial leaf wax delta H-2 suggest long-term directional shifts in temperature at this site through the middle to late Holocene, as climate became wetter. It appears that precipitation isotopes did not track local temperatures on millennial timescales in this part of midcontinent North America through the Holocene, and instead may have covaried with changes in Northern Hemisphere latitudinal temperature gradients driven by large Arctic temperature changes.

J	Reynolds, CS				Reynolds, CS			Phosphorus recycling in lakes: Evidence from large limnetic enclosures for the importance of shallow sediments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The dynamics of phosphorus in large field enclosures are described from a series of experimental manipulations directed primarily to the study of phytoplankton populations. The enclosures were similar in size but differed in their depth contours. The aim of the present analysis was to detect systematic differences in the phosphorus budgets of deep and shallow systems. 2. The sequence of events in each of six year-long experiments is described in terms of algal production. The values are compared with water-column measurements of total phosphorus (TP) the reactive fraction (SRP) and changes in the particulate fraction (PP, assumed to be TP minus SRP). Stoichiometric ratios for larger phytoplankton crops were in the range 85-110 C/P (molar). 3. The annual aggregate of new carbon produced in the two uniformly deep enclosures (approximate to 11.5 m) in relation to the phosphorus supplied was also remarkably close to Redfield stoichiometry, with between 87 and 97 mol C yielded per mol P added. However, in the graded enclosure (< 4-13.5 m), the yield was up to twice as great (maximum: 197 mol C mol(-1) P available). 4. There are two possible mechanisms. A graded surface permits a greater area of sediment to be in contact with the hypolimnion and for the sediment oxygen demand to deplete a greater hypolimnetic volume; the associated fall in redox would have been adequate to explain the observed increment of dissolved phosphorus to the hypolimnion, associated with the Einsele-Mortimer model (ferric --> ferrous iron reduction). There was no clear evidence that this phosphorus supported autotrophic production until late in the year. 5. The alternative mechanism is based on the association of phosphorus 'injection' to the epilimnion during wind-mixed episodes, when the enhanced shear stress on shallow sediments resuspends fine, superficial deposits and their interstitial waters into the full circulation. Circumstantial evidence suggests this second pathway predominated in the graded enclosure but was ineffective in the uniformly deep enclosures. 6. The role of mechanical, aerobic phosphorus cycling in the nutrient economy of lakes, especially small or shallow ones, may have been underestimated in the past but it must be considered when evaluating any proposal to reduce the external nutrient loads to lakes.																			0046-5070					JUN	1996	35	3					623	645																WOS:A1996UY07900011

Population and outmigration characteristics of juvenile Bull Trout in a montane ecosystem	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus is a federally threatened species in the conterminous United States. Although some populations are stable or increasing, Bull Trout in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's designated Coeur d'Alene Core Area in Idaho have experienced substantial declines in abundance. Today, the remaining extant population in the Coeur d'Alene Core Area returns to the headwaters of the St. Joe River to spawn. The population has been monitored annually since 1992 using spawning ground surveys, but little is known about early life stages in the system. The objective of our research was to evaluate the distribution and abundance, age and size structure, habitat associations, and outmigration characteristics of juvenile Bull Trout in the upper St. Joe River basin. In 2022-2023, we sampled 200 stream reaches on the mainstem St. Joe River and four tributaries (Heller, Medicine, Sherlock, and Wisdom creeks). We sampled 1,529 Bull Trout varying in length from 29-257 mm in total length (TL; mean +/- SD; 108 +/- 44 mm). Population estimates suggested there were 1,841 (95% CI = 1,188-2,494) juvenile Bull Trout in the study area in 2022 and 2,388 (1,646-3,130) in 2023. Regression models indicated that abundance was positively related to canopy cover, amount of large substrate, amount of large woody debris, and amount of gravel, and negatively related to water temperature. We tagged 1,142 fish with passive integrated transponders (PIT) and detected 163 (14%) of these fish using a stationary tag array that was operational during June or July through October. Peak autumn outmigration occurred in October of both sampling years. Of the fish that were detected moving, age varied from 1-4 years, but age-1 and age-2 fish were more commonly detected moving downstream compared to other age classes. This study provides important information on the ecology of juvenile Bull Trout that can be used to guide conservation and recovery efforts in montane ecosystems. Furthermore, juvenile Bull Trout in the upper St. Joe River basin were present at similar densities and experienced growth rates similar to more robust adfluvial populations (e.g., Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho), thereby indicating that factors contributing to the low abundance of adults are not likely occurring in the headwaters of the St. Joe River. Thus, conservation efforts may be more successful if they are focused on the migration corridor and Coeur d'Alene Lake.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				2025 SEP 22	2025										10.1002/jwmg.70116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.70116		SEP 2025											WOS:001575910800001

Horn and Cicindela Linne are distinguished in a key. For each of the 1st 5 genera, numbers of Australian species, geographical distributions and habitats of the adults are described. Diagnostic characteristics are provided for the genus Cicindela Linne. Australian species (29) are arranged in 7 species-groups as follows: the C. iosceles group, 6 spp.; the C. higrina group, 2 spp.: the C. carnarvona group (= subgenus Grandopronotalia W. Horn, genus Prothyma), 1 sp., C. carnarvona, nom. nov.; the C. tetragramma group, 7 spp., including C. levitetragramma, sp. nov. (type locality, western Australia, Port Hedland); the C. ypsilon group, 4 spp.; the C. igneicollis group, 5 spp., including C. gairdneri, sp. nov. (type locality, southern Australia, Lake Gairdner); the C. semicincta group, 4 spp., including C. parasemicincta, sp. nov. (type locality, south Australia, Wobna Mound Spring). Placement of the C. iosceles and C. carnarvona groups is discussed. A key is provided for all species and 5 subspecies. Species-groups, species and subspecies are revised, described and illustrated, and the ranges of species indicated by maps. A history of the Australian species of Cicindela is derived, which comprises a reconstructed phylogeny, based on adult characteristics and zoogeography based on patterns of geographical distributions of species-groups, ecological requirements, vicariance relations of sister group and climatic events of the past. Five species-groups are endemic to Australia. Geographical distributions indicate that 4 (C. iosceles, C. nigrina, C. tetragramma and C. carnarvona) are relicts of extinct Oriental lineages, and one (C. igneicollis) a relict of a south ancient lineage. Species-groups (C. ypsilon and C. semicincta) are southernmost extensions of extant Oriental groups. Zoogeographical evidence suggests that most founding stocks invaded northern Australia through New Guinea during the Tertiary and Pleistocene, and speciation in the Pleistocene was generated in the northeast by periodic retreats and invasions of the sea in the Gulf of Carpentaria during glacial and interglacial phases.																			0004-959X	1446-5698					1979				66			1	99																WOS:A1979GX04200001

Methodological Approach to the Identification of the Sources and Genesis of Buried Organic Matter in Holocene Sections of Lake Sapropels (Southern West Siberia and Eastern Baikal Area)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We present results of study of the chemical composition of organic matter (C, H, N, and S) from Holocene sections of lake sapropels with undisturbed stratification penetrated by vibratory drilling of the bottom sediments, down to the underlying rocks, of Lakes Bol'shie Toroki (1.8 m), Minzelinskoe (5 m), Ochki (4.5 m), Dukhovoe (7 m), and Kotokel' (6 m). We consider methodological approaches to the identification of the sources and genesis of buried organic matter in marine and lacustrine sediments by a number of organogeochemical indicators: data of a biological analysis (biostratification based on layer-by-layer determination of organic relics in bottom sediment sections); hydrocarbon biomarkers (molecular composition of normal aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-alkanes), nitrogen compounds of a protein complex, etc.); and C/N ratio reflecting a difference in the biochemical compositions of bioproducers. The results of biological analysis (biostratification) show that planktonogenic sapropel (phyto- and zooplankton, the autochthonous source of organic matter) in Lake Ochki formed for 10,760 years, and sphagnum and hypnum moss were supplied from the bogged shores (allochthonous source of organic matter). In Lake Minzelinskoe, peaty sapropel formed at the stage of a flooded lowland bog (5905 years ago); since 3980 years ago and till the present, macrophytogenic sapropel has formed. Pyrolytic study (RE pyrolysis and Pyr-GC-MS analysis) of bioproducers and sapropel from Lake Ochki has shown that phytoplankton and zooplankton were the main autochthonous source of OM in the lake, which is confirmed by the identified macromolecules of nitrogen compounds of different compositions. The presence of hopanes indicates the contribution of microorganisms to the formation of OM in the sediments. The organic matter of sapropel has a terrigenous component, which is confirmed by the presence of high-molecular odd-numbered n-alkanes, ketones, and methyl esters of fatty acid. The C/N ratios in the stratified sections of macrophytogenic sapropels of Lakes Bol'shie Toroki and Minzelinskoe fall in the range of values specific to higher aquatic and terrestrial vegetation (C/N = 15-18), whereas the C/N ratios in planktonogenic sapropel of Lake Dukhovoe are typical of marine and lake plankton (C/N = 5.7-8.6).

J	Brown, PG; ReVelle, DO; Tagliaferri, E; Hildebrand, AR				Brown, PG; ReVelle, DO; Tagliaferri, E; Hildebrand, AR			An entry model for the Tagish Lake fireball using seismic, satellite and infrasound records	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												We present instrumental observations of the Tagish Lake fireball and interpret the observed characteristics in the context of two different models of ablation. From these models we estimate the pre-atmospheric mass of the Tagish Lake meteoroid to be similar to56 tonnes and its porosity to be between 37 and 58%, with the lowest part of this range most probable. These models further suggest that some 1300 kg of gram-sized or larger Tagish Lake material survived ablation to reach the Earth's surface, representing an ablation loss of 97% for the fireball. Satellite recordings of the Tagish Lake fireball indicate that 1.1 x 10(12) J of optical energy were emitted by the fireball during the last 4 s of its flight. The fraction of the total kinetic energy converted to light in the satellite pass band is found to be 16%. Infrasonic observations of the air-wave associated with the fireball establish a total energy for the event of 1.66 +/- 0.70 kT TNT equivalent energy. The fraction of this total energy converted to acoustic signal energy is found to be between 0.10 and 0.23%. Examination of the seismic recordings of the airwave from Tagish Lake have established that the acoustic energy near the sub-terminal point is converted to seismic body waves in the upper-most portion of the Earth's crust. The acoustic energy to seismic energy coupling efficiency is found to be near 10(-6) for the Tagish Lake fireball. The resulting energy estimate is near 1.7 kT, corresponding to a meteoroid 4 in in diameter. The seismic record indicates extensive, nearly continuous fragmentation of the body over the height intervals from 50 to 32 kin. Seismic and infrasound energy estimates are in close agreement with the preatmospheric mass of 56 tonnes established from the modeling. The observed flight characteristics of the Tagish Lake fireball indicate that the bulk compressive strength of the pre-atmospheric Tagish Lake meteoroid was near 0.25 MPa, while the material compressive strength (most appropriate to the recovered meteorites) was closer to 0.7 MPa. These are much lower than values found for fireballs of ordinary chondritic composition. The behavior of the Tagish Lake fireball suggests that it represents the lowest end of the strength spectrum of carbonaceous chondrites or the high end of cometary meteoroids. The bulk density and porosity results for the Tagish Lake meteoroid suggest that the low bulk densities measured for some small primitive bodies in the solar system may reflect physical structure dominated by microporosity rather than macroporosity and rubble-pile assemblages.

As the sodium chloride is a high demanded resource since ancient times, old salt mining works are documented to have been executed even in areas nowadays exploited. The lack of precise location of ancient mine entrances and abandoned underground fieldwork locations poses severe problems to current mining activity, as well for other types of land use. Sinkholes, landslides, induced seismicity and eruptions of pressured salt brines springs are among the most common geological hazards associated to salt mining activities. Geophysics is known to play an important role in rock mineral exploration due to the capability of geophysical methods to explore the specific structures of geological formations or the rocks petrophysical properties. The same techniques of investigation, adequately adapted to the site specific requirements and targets, can be used for hazard delineation in nowadays exploited or in old mine areas. For hazard assessment, several studies which implied the use of gravity and resistivity prospection methods have been executed in high risk zones of a salt mine. The studied mine area is a joint between ancient exploitation zones still undiscovered, already collapsed salt mines or recently exploited and abandoned ones, placed in active mining areas. The complex salt tectonics, the presence of land instability areas and lakes with salty water (formed after the collapse of old mines roof), the presence of platforms covered with thick concrete layers and the recent constructed industrial buildings, created a challenging environment for the geophysical prospection. Despite the field impediments, the employed geophysical methods proved to be very useful for hazard delineation in salt mine areas. Gravimetric maps revealed the cause of a building subsidence, the data processing allowing the characterization of the buried hazardous source. The resistivity geoelectrical measurements (VES and ERT) revealed old mine shafts, abandoned salt exploitation rooms displaying broken roofs, fractures affecting the entire salt deposit and neighboring geological formations. Through the use the mentioned geophysical methods it was possible to characterize this very unstable industrial area.

J	Gliwicz, ZM; Slon, J; Szynkarczyk, I				Gliwicz, ZM; Slon, J; Szynkarczyk, I			Trading safety for food: evidence from gut contents in roach and bleak captured at different distances offshore from their daytime littoral refuge	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Regular diel habitat shifts in roach were detected by hydro-acoustics in five moderately eutrophic, stratifying (maximum depth 24-27 m) and approximately circular lakes (of surface area 15, 75, 125, 300 and 900 ha and diameters 250, 600, 1000, 1700 and 2600 m) in north-eastern Poland in the years 1998-2000, when the lakes were free of smelt and other typical offshore planktivores, and their offshore areas were completely free of fish during the day. 2. The diel change in roach distribution was shown to assume a similar pattern in each lake: fish migrated from a daytime littoral refuge towards the centre of the lake at dusk, and returned to the littoral refuge at dawn. After sunset, fish gradually dispersed offshore until they covered the entire lake area in each of the three smaller lakes. In each of the two larger lakes, only small numbers of fish were seen in the central area at night, implying that the centre of the lake retained high food availability throughout the summer. 3. Inshore-offshore gradients in zooplankton prey density, body size, and numbers of eggs per clutch were weak or undetectable in the two smallest lakes, but strong and persistent in the three larger lakes, with Daphnia densities 5-30 times as high and body length 1.2-1.5 times as great in the central area as inshore. 4. The likely increase in the potential predation risk with distance from the littoral daytime refuge was found to be compensated by increased food gains in those fish which moved offshore at dusk to feed within a short time window, when light intensity was lower to make the risk reduced, but still high enough to see zooplankton prey. The benefit because of increased prey acquisition was greatest in the centre of the largest lake (at 1300 m from the shore), as revealed from gut inspections of roach and bleak trawl-sampled at different distances from the edge of the reed belt, and seen as a gradual, order-of-magnitude increase in the volume of food in the foregut, The food volume against distance-from-shore regression was highly significant on each of the four sampling dates in the largest lake, in spite of the wide variability of food volume in individual fish.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2006	51	5					823	839		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01530.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01530.x													WOS:000236767100003

Diatoms, chrysophyte stomatocysts, chironomids, plant pigments and spheroidal carbonaceous particles ( SCPs) were analysed as well as sediment lithostratigraphic parameters. Using a radiometric approach the sediment core was dated and a depth of 4.6 cm was found to correspond to 1852 AD. The sediment accumulation rate ( 0.0034 g.cm(-2).yr(-1)) was one of the lowest identified in the European mountain lake project, MOLAR. Despite this slow accumulation rate a remarkably coherent lithological and stratigraphic record has been recovered. The sediments of this remote mountain site, largely free from the effects of direct human impact, have been found to display a wealth of variability over the last 200 years. The record of spheroidal carbonaceous particles, indicators of anthropogenic pollution deposition, begins around 4.5-5.0 cm in depth (1833-1857). Temporal patterns are typical of European lake sites with the concentration peaking in the late 1970 s. The SCP/(210)Pb inventory ratio for the site is also in good agreement with the European latitudinal pattern. A strong influence of sample age on the chrysophyte assemblage composition in the upper-most 4 6 cm indicates that the main changes in the cysts have been related to long term environmental changes, probably pH. Analysis of chironomid remains revealed a stable profundal community. Chironomids as a whole showed no correlations to temperature fluctuations in the last 200 years. Relatively abundant remains of Diamesa sp. head capsules and other taxa closely associated with stream conditions in the older layers contrast with the absence of Diamesa sp. in the recent sediments. This change is considered to be evidence for the existence of a stronger, more stable inlet supplied from permanent granular snow fields in the lake basin. The most important changes in diatom assemblages were observed at 3 cm. Many species of the genus Achnanthes spp. together with Navicula schmassmannii and Orthoseira roeseana made up the greatest part of the diatom community above 3 cm, being absent or rare lower in the record. A positive correlation between diatoms and mean summer temperature was found.

A depositional history of particulate organic carbon in a floodplain lake from the lower Ob' River, Siberia	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Northern, high latitude soils have stored vast amounts of organic carbon (OC) in permafrost and peats for many millennia, however, climate change may mobilize and release this particulate OC (POC) to arctic rivers. Deltaic and floodplain lakes that receive fluvial sediments, primarily during the spring freshet, may provide records of such changes in riverine POC. Here, we examine properties of OC in a sediment core from a lake in the lower floodplain of the Ob' River, west Siberia, to determine how the properties of OC deposited in this lake varied over many decades and to evaluate use of this sedimentary OC as a recorder of riverine POC load and properties. The core predates the most recent, dramatic changes in arctic climate and hence may serve as a benchmark against which to contrast future variations in fluvial POC discharge. Elemental, stable carbon and radiocarbon isotopic analyses, along with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular-level information (lignin phenol composition), indicate two major sources of OC to most of the sediments in this lake: plant-derived OC and algal-derived OC. However, a mixing model indicates that the nature and C-14 content of these two sources change with depth in the sediment, resulting in three distinct layers: surface horizons, a "high-OC" layer and "mixing" horizons found above and below the high-OC layer. The plant-derived component is significantly aged throughout the core (C-14 ages of 1300-3900 years) and appears to derive from primarily local, tundra sources, whereas the algal component is modern. Our analysis suggests that the usual mode of OC deposition, as exemplified by the "mixing" and surface horizons, involved mixing of varying amounts of new algal production (35-65%) with aged permafrost-or peat-derived OC. This deposition was interrupted by an event, such as the collapse of a riverbank, which laid down the compositionally distinct "high-OC" layer in which plant-derived OC mixes with aged mineral-soil-derived OC without clear input from algae. The relative amounts of the plant and algal components in the lake sediments appear to be controlled primarily by local hydrological conditions rather than by river-wide processes, suggesting that comparison of sediment records from multiple lakes within a floodplain will be important to assess changes in POC export by arctic rivers. However, the flux and nature of the higher plant-derived OC may carry important information on the sources and dynamics of OC stored within the drainage basin. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	He, Q; Fok, HS; Chen, Q; Chun, KP				He, Qing; Fok, Hok Sum; Chen, Qiang; Chun, Kwok Pan			Water Level Reconstruction and Prediction Based on Space-Borne Sensors: A Case Study in the Mekong and Yangtze River Basins	SENSORS												Water level (WL) measurements denote surface conditions that are useful for monitoring hydrological extremes, such as droughts and floods, which both affect agricultural productivity and regional development. Due to spatially sparse in situ hydrological stations, remote sensing measurements that capture localized instantaneous responses have recently been demonstrated to be a viable alternative to WL monitoring. Despite a relatively good correlation with WL, a traditional passive remote sensing derived WL is reconstructed from nearby remotely sensed surface conditions that do not consider the remotely sensed hydrological variables of a whole river basin. This method's accuracy is also limited. Therefore, a method based on basin-averaged, remotely sensed precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and gravimetrically derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) is proposed for WL reconstruction in the Yangtze and Mekong River basins in this study. This study examines the WL reconstruction performance from these two remotely sensed hydrological variables and their corresponding drought indices (i.e., TRMM Standardized Precipitation Index (TRMM-SPI) and GRACE Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI)) on a monthly temporal scale. A weighting procedure is also developed to explore a further potential improvement in the WL reconstruction. We found that the reconstructed WL derived from the hydrological variables compares well to the observed WL. The derived drought indices perform even better than those of their corresponding hydrological variables. The indices' performance rate is owed to their ability to bypass the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in a standardized form and their basin-wide integrated information. In general, all performance indicators (i.e., the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Root-mean-squares error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE)) reveal that the remotely sensed hydrological variables (and their corresponding drought indices) are better alternatives compared with traditional remote sensing indices (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), despite different geographical regions. In addition, almost all results are substantially improved by the weighted averaging procedure. The most accurate WL reconstruction is derived from a weighted TRMM-SPI for the Mekong (and Yangtze River basins) and displays a PCC of 0.98 (and 0.95), a RMSE of 0.19 m (and 0.85 m), and a NSE of 0.95 (and 0.89); by comparison, the remote sensing variables showed less accurate results (PCC of 0.88 (and 0.82), RMSE of 0.41 m (and 1.48 m), and NSE of 0.78 (and 0.67)) for its inferred WL. Additionally, regardless of weighting, GRACE-DSI displays a comparable performance. An external assessment also shows similar results. This finding indicates that the combined usage of remotely sensed hydrological variables in a standardized form and the weighted averaging procedure could lead to an improvement in WL reconstructions for river basins affected by ENSO events and hydrological extremes.

Soil and sediment properties affecting the accumulation of mercury in a flood control reservoir	CATENA												Mercury accumulations in some fish species from Grenada Lake in north Mississippi exceed the Food and Drug Administration standards for human consumption. This large flood control reservoir serves as a sink for the Skuna and Yalobusha River watersheds whose highly erodible soils contribute to excessively high sediment yields and impaired water quality. This study was conducted to characterize the distribution of total Hg in watershed soils and determine the relationship between the easily transportable clay, organic C (OC), and Fe oxide fractions and the movement of Hg from upland sources to reservoir sinks. Cores were collected from soils, of different land-use, representative of the three soil orders (Alfisols, Entisols. and Vertisols) found in the watersheds. Sediment cores were collected from the Yalobusha River and Grenada Lake. In the laboratory, soil cores were sampled by horizon while sediment cores were sampled in 10 cm increments. These samples were characterized for total Hg, particle size distribution. OC, Fe oxide contents, and pH. Mercury concentrations ranged from 10 to 112 mu g kg(-1) in the soil profiles, with average regression coefficient (r(2)) values of 0.104, 0.362, and 0.06 for Hg versus clay, CC, and Fe oxides, respectively. River sediment cores had Hg concentrations ranging from 0 to 38 mu g kg(-1), and significant (1% level) r(2) values of 0.611, 0.447, and 0.632 versus clay, OC, and Fe oxides, respectively. Mercury concentrations in the lake sediment ranged from 0 to 125 mu g kg(-1). The r(2) values for Hg versus clay, OC, and Fe oxides in the lake sediment were 0.813, 0.499, and 0.805, respectively. all significant at the 1% level. These results indicate that total Hg is poorly correlated with the clay, OC, and Fe oxide fractions at depth in the soil profiles because maximum Hg concentrations occur in the surface horizons due to atmospheric in-fall. The statistically significant r(2) values for Hg versus these components in the sediment cores are the result of particulate clay, Fe oxides, and finely divided OC sorption of Hg from solution during the runoff and sediment transport process. The higher correlations for the lake sediment reflect an enrichment of the Hg-laden clay fraction relative to stream sediment through flocculation and sedimentation processes in the slack-water environment of the reservoir.

Additionally, the effects of complex terrain and associated orographic forcing are crucial in wind energy production. Furthermore, the use of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations in the analysis of complex terrain is still considered the "workhorse" since millions of mesh points are required to accurately capture the details of the surface. On the other hand, solving the same problem by means of the instantaneous governing equations of the flow (i.e., in a suite of DNS or LES) would imply almost prohibitive computational resources. In this study, numerical predictions of atmospheric boundary layers are performed over a complex topography located in NygArdsfjell, Norway. The Nygardsfjell wind farm is located in a valley at approximately 420 meters above sea level surrounded by mountains in the north and south near the Swedish border. Majority of the winds are believed to be originated from Tornetrask lake in the east which is covered with ice during the winter time. The air closest to the surface on surrounding mountains gets colder and denser. The air then slides down the hill and accumulates over the lake. Later, the air spills out westward towards Ofotfjord through the broader channel that directs and transforms it into highly accelerated winds. Consequently, one of the objectives of the present article is to study the influence of local terrain on shaping these winds over the wind farm. It is worth mentioning that we are not considering any wind turbine model in the present investigation, being the main purpose to understand the influence of the local surface topography and roughness on the wind flow. Nevertheless, future research will include modeling the presence of a wind turbine and will be published elsewhere. The governing equations of the flow are solved by using a RANS approach and by considering three different two-equation turbulence models: k-omega (k -omega), k-epsilon (k - epsilon) and shear stress transport (SST). Furthermore, the real topographical characteristics of the terrain have been modeled by extracting the required area from the larger digital elevation model (DEM) spanning over 100 km square. The geometry is then extruded using Rhino and meshed in ANSYS Fluent. The terrain dimensions are approximately 2000x1000 meter square.					; Birkelund, Yngve/G-5358-2016	Birkelund, Yngve/0000-0003-3244-5613; 															978-0-7918-5685-7				2016									V002T19A005															WOS:000374279500065

Samples were collected at 30 measurement sites, from 0.8. 1.6, 2.4, 3.2 and 4.0 in depths and analysed for their molecular and isotopic compositions. Most of the methane and all higher gaseous hydrocarbons accumulated within the near-surface zone are of thermogenic origin. The distribution of thermogenic methane and higher gaseous hydrocarbons in Quaternary sediments is variable and,, generally, increases with depth. Microbial methane or a mixture of microbial and thermogenic methane also Occurs at the near-surface zone. The presence of hydrogen and alkenes in the near-surface gases also suggests a contribution from recent, microbial processes. Helium of crustal origin migrated through the Rinne Fault and other tectonic zones located in the study area, and was subsequently dispersed during migration through the lithologically diversified Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. The high variability of the carbon dioxide concentration and stable carbon isotope composition at various depths in the near-surface zone is caused by its polygenetic origin (thermogenic, microbial, and oxidation of hydrocarbons and Quaternary organic matter), and also by its dissolution in water and oil during migration through lithologically diversified Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. Zones of thermogenic methane occurrence within Pleistocene sediments, dominated by muds saturated with bitumen and brines, provide the most favourable environment for preservation of large extinct mammals. It is likely that during the Pleistocene winters, when thick ice and snow covered the tundra lake and swamp, zones of Outflow of brines, oils, helium, and thermogenic gaseous hydrocarbons had a higher temperature, Which Could have resulted in melting and cracking of the ice cover and drowning of large mammals. The most favourable conditions for preservation of large, extinct mammals probably still exists in the vicinity of sampling probe sites Nos 21, 22, 23 and 36. Zones of dominance of microbial methane concentrations are less favourable sites for preservation of extinct mammals, because this methane was generated within recent swamps and also within recent descending meteoric waters which infiltrated into Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. Older Pleistocene microbial gases have already escaped to the atmosphere.

J	Puleo, PJK; Axford, Y				Puleo, Peter J. K.; Axford, Yarrow			Duration and ice thickness of a Late Holocene outlet glacier advance near Narsarsuaq, southern Greenland	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) outlet glaciers are currently losing mass, leading to sea level rise. Reconstructions of past outlet glacier behavior through the Holocene help us better understand how they respond to climate change. Kiattuut Sermiat, a southern Greenland outlet glacier near Narsarsuaq, is known to have experienced an unusually large Late Holocene advance that culminated at similar to 1600 cal yr BP and exceeded the glacier's Little Ice Age extent. We report sedimentary records from two lakes at slightly different elevations in an upland valley adjacent to Kiattuut Sermiat. These reveal when the outlet glacier's surface elevation was higher than during the Little Ice Age and constrain the associated outlet glacier surface elevation. We use bulk sediment geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, color, texture, and the presence of aquatic plant macrofossils to distinguish between till, glaciolacustrine sediments, and organic lake sediments. Our 14C results above basal till recording regional deglaciation skew slightly old due to a reservoir effect but are generally consistent with regional deglaciation occurring similar to 11 000 cal yr BP. Neoglacial advance of Kiattuut Sermiat is recorded by deposition of glaciolacustrine sediments in the lower-elevation lake, which we infer was subsumed by an ice-dammed lake that formed along the glacier's margin just after similar to 3900 cal yr BP. This timing is consistent with several other glacial records in Greenland showing neoglacial cooling driving advance between similar to 4500-3000 cal yr BP. Given that glaciolacustrine sediments were deposited only in the lower-elevation lake, combined with glacial geomorphological evidence in the valley containing these lakes, we estimate the former ice margin's elevation to have been similar to 670 m a.s.l., compared with similar to 420 m a.s.l. today. The ice-dammed lake persisted until the glacier surface fell below this elevation at similar to 1600 cal yr BP. The retreat timing contrasts with overall evidence for cooling and glacier advance in the region at that time, so we infer that Kiattuut Sermiat's retreat may have resulted from reduced snowfall amounts and/or local glaciological complexity. High sensitivity to precipitation changes could also explain the relatively limited Little Ice Age advance of Kiattuut Sermiat compared with the earlier neoglacial advance.

These changes are accompanied by various anomalies and extreme events that negatively impact ecosystems worldwide. Monoculture forests, including Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) monocultures, are particularly vulnerable to these changes due to their homogeneous structure and simplified ecosystem linkages compared to mixed forests, making them more sensitive to extreme events such as insect outbreaks, droughts, fires and strong winds. In the context of global warming, forest fires are becoming extremely dangerous, and the risk of their occurrence increases as average temperatures rise. The situation becomes even more dramatic when fire enters areas of peatlands, as these ecosystems effectively withdraw carbon from the rapid carbon cycle and store it for up to thousands of years. Consequently, peatlands become emitters of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.In this study, we aim to trace the last 300 years of historical development of a peatland situated in a Scots pine monoculture. Our focus is on the Okoniny (Jezierzba) peatland located within Tuchola Forest in northern Poland, one of the country's largest forest complexes. We delved into the phase when the peatland's surroundings transitioned from a mixed forest to a pine monoculture and investigated the impact of changes in forest management on the peatland vegetation and hydrology. Our reconstructions are based on a multi-proxy approach using pollen, plant macrofossils, micro- and macro-charcoal, and testate amoebae. We combine the peatland palaeoecological record with the dendrochronology of Pinus sylvestris to compare the response of these two archives. Our results show that a change in forest management and progressive climate warming affected the development of the peatland. We note an increase in acidity over the analysed period and a decrease in the water table over the last few decades that led to the lake-peatland transition. These changes progressed along with the strongest agricultural activity in the area in the 19th century. However, the 20th century was a period of continuous decline in agriculture and an increase in the dominance of Scots pine in the landscape as the result of afforestation. Dendroclimatic data indicate a negative effect of temperature on Scots pine and pressure from summer rainfall deficiency. Additional remote sensing analysis, using hyperspectral, lidar and thermal airborne data, provided information about the current condition of the peatland vegetation. With the application of spectral indices and the analysis of land surface temperature, spatial variations in peatland drying have been identified. Considering the context of forest management and the protection of valuable ecosystems in monocultural forests, the conclusions are relevant for peatland and forest ecology, palaeoecology, and forestry.					; Lamentowicz, Mariusz/E-8784-2010; Wietecha, Martyna/R-5120-2018; Marcisz, Katarzyna/C-4021-2013; Kołaczek, Piotr/HLX-2920-2023; Kopeć, Dominik/AHA-5976-2022	Bak, Mariusz/0000-0002-5812-1943; Kopec, Dominik/0000-0003-0831-2992; Lamentowicz, Mariusz/0000-0003-0429-1530; Marcisz, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2655-9729; matulewski, pawel/0000-0002-5670-3579; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				NOV 19	2024	21	22					5143	5172		10.5194/bg-21-5143-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-5143-2024													WOS:001357838900001

NOVA HEDWIGIA												Material derived from several mass developments of Cyclostephanos delicatus (Genkal) Casper & Scheffler in younger sediments of shallow, eutrophic Lake Vielbeck (Northern Germany) was used for morphological and ecological investigations. The mass occurrence of C. delicatus at a sediment depth of 40 cm is considered to have started approx. 70 years ago, and it became the dominant species of all diatoms recorded between a sediment depth of 30 cm and the top of the core. C. delicatus from these samples was compared with a very similar taxon, Cyclostephanos tholiformis Stoermer, Hakansson & Theriot. The examinations included light and scanning electron microscopy of both, C. tholiformis (Isotypes from the type locality Lazy Lagoon, North America) and C. delicatus (Lake Vielbeck, Northern Germany) as well as the evaluation of the ecological data of Lake Vielbeck. The latter is similar to reported data from other localities of both, C. delicatus and C. tholiformis, which prefer well-mixed shallow waters with high nutrient levels and summer temperatures, often connected with high organic load. The extensive material of C. delicatus obtained from sediments of Lake Vielbeck showed great morphological variability which mainly concerning cell diameter, degree of silicification, appearance and number of spines, mode and size of areolae and number of cowlings around the mantle area fultoportulae. In this regard, the original descriptions of C. delicatus and C. tholiformis proved not to be complete. Both, this fact and much confusion in the related literature, complicated the differentiation between these two species. As a result of our investigations it must be concluded that the morphological variability of C. delicatus is much greater than assumed in the hitherto existing literature. Furthermore, C. tholiformis lies within the range of morphological variability of C. delicatus and it must be formally expressed as a synonym of C. delicatus. A second important result of our investigation is the fact that the number of cowlings surrounding inside tubes of mantle area fultoportulae is not always constant within a species, because we found some valves of C. delicatus with two and some with three cowlings around the inside tubes of mantle area fultoportulae. It must therefore be stressed that the number of cowlings is not always a reliable criterion for species differentiation within the Thalassiosiraceae.																			0029-5035					MAY	2006	82	3-4					409	434		10.1127/0029-5035/2006/0082-0409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0029-5035/2006/0082-0409													WOS:000237903800009

New insights into the southern margin of the Archean-Proterozoic boundary in the north-central United States based on U-Pb, Sm-Nd, and Ar-Ar geochronology	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												New geophysical analysis of the Precambrian basement in Minnesota-lowa-Wisconsin indicates that an Archean-Proterozoic boundary (Spirit Lake trend) previously recognized in NW Iowa can be continued eastward into central Wisconsin and farther east as the Spirit Lake tectonic zone (SLtz). To test the age of Paleoproterozoic crust south of this structure, several subsurface samples of Precambrian basement from the north-central United States have been analyzed or re-examined using modem techniques of U-Pb, Sm-Nd, and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology. The results fill in a major data gap for the region and show that all U-Pb crystallization ages for samples south of the SLtz are geon 17 (1700-1800 Ma). Bedrock core samples from eastern Nebraska are ca. 1760-1800 Ma, and two samples from SE South Dakota, immediately south of the SLtz, yield ages of 1762 28 Ma (Vermillion) and 1733 2 Ma (Elk Point). Xenoliths from impact breccia in the Manson structure in north-central Iowa yield a similar age of ca. 1705 +/- 30 Ma and metagabbro from SE Minnesota yields an age of 1760 +/- 9 Ma. Farther to the northeast, zircons from Paleoproterozoic gneiss in the basement of Manitoulin Island, only a few krn south of the Superior craton in Ontario, also yield a geon 17 age (1714 +/- 10 Ma). Sm-Nd model ages (T-DM) for samples immediately south of the SLtz fall in the range 1.9-2.2 Ga, indicating limited involvement of Archean crust. In contrast, Sm-Nd T-DM ages for samples north of the SLtz typically range from 2.5 to 3.0 Ga, for both Paleoproterozoic plutons and Archean gneisses. lon microprobe analyses of zircons from the Elk Point and Manson samples also show the presence of geon 16 overgrowths, indicating a strong regional thermal overprint during geon 16 accretion. This is supported by mid-geon 16 homblende 40Ar/39Ar ages for samples from SE South Dakota and SE Minnesota. Although no U-Pb ages are available for juvenile basement beneath the ca. 1760 Ma granite-rhyolite suite of southern Wisconsin, south of the SLtz, Sm-Nd model ages are typically ca. 1.9-2.0 Ga, consistent with basement to the rhyolites being geon 17 in age. Collectively, the data require that most, if not all, of the Paleoproterozoic crust immediately south of the SLtz formed during geon 17 and probably represents eastward continuation, from Colorado, through Nebraska, of the Yavapai crustal province in the SW United States. Penokean (geon 18) crustal rocks are limited mainly to northern and central Wisconsin, east-central Minnesota, and northern Michigan. These results also show that medium grade (> 500 degrees C) tectonothermal effects of the subsequent geon 16 (approximate to Mazatzal) orogeny to the south continue into the north-central United States.

Bioluminescent reporters, constructed by fusing the fepA - fes promoter of Escherichia coli (an Enterobactin biosynthesis gene regulated by the ferric uptake regulatory [Furl] system) to a luxCDABE cassette, were integrated into the chromosome of a halotolerant Pseudomonas putida, which uses the Fur system to regulate high-affinity Fe uptake. The resultant P. putida bioreporter has been successfully tested both in lab and field studies. Laboratory cultures were maintained at a range of concentrations of total Fe (0-25 nM) or limited by the addition of concentrations of well-characterized siderophores (desferrioxamine B [DFB], ferrichrome, 2,2'-dipyridyl [DP] and Rhodotorulic acid [RA], 0-200 nM) and used to establish the dynamic range of this reporter system. Analysis of sample incubations after only 4 h suggest that both of the trihydroxamate-type siderophores DFB and ferrichrome efficiently reduced Fe availability, resulting respectively in a 1.77- and 1.88-fold increase in luminescence relative to Fe-replete conditions. In contrast, additions of the dihydroxamate-type siderophore RA and the synthetic chelator DP resulted in no response from the system, suggesting that cells could access Fe complexed to these compounds without activating high-affinity Fe transport systems. Field studies were performed in the central basin of Lake Erie, which has previously been shown to undergo sporadic Fe limitation during summer stratification. DFB concentrations were titrated across a range of 0-50 nM into unfiltered water to manipulate Fe availabilities. Bioreporters expressed Fe stress (ca. a 2-fold increase in luminescence) at concentrations of DFB equivalent to the total (dissolved + particulate) Fe in the system ( approximate to 30 nM), indicative of the concentration of bioavailable Fe. In a similar experiment with 0.2-mum pre-filtered water (2.25-5.24 nM Fe), a 6-fold increase in luminescence (relative to controls) was observed at the lowest (15 nM) concentration of chelators. The results of this study demonstrate the validity of bioreporters as a complimentary tool to measurements of total Fe. Moreover, these results suggest that a significant source of bioavailable Fe flux may be particulate in nature, and support the hypothesis that Fe recycling from microorganisms may play a key role in the regeneration of bioavailable forms of Fe.

Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging may predict poor outcome in children with severe traumatic brain injuries who undergo cranial surgery	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS												OBJECTIVE Multiple studies have evaluated the use of MRI for prognostication in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and have found a correlation between diffuse axonal injury (DAI)-type lesions and outcome. However, there remains a limited understanding about the use of MRI for prognostication after severe TBI in children who have undergone cranial surgery. METHODS Children with severe TBI who underwent craniectomy or craniotomy at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, between 2010 and 2019 were identified retrospectively. Of these 92 patients, 43 underwent postoper- ative brain MRI within 4 months of surgery. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and FLAIR sequences were used to designate areas of hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic cerebral lesions related to DAI. Patients were then stratified based on the location of the DAI as read by a neuroradiologist as superficial, deep, or brainstem. The location of the DAI and other variables associated with poor outcome, including Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pediatric trauma score, mechanism of injury, and time to surgery, were analyzed for correlation with poor outcome. Outcomes were reported using the King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI). RESULTS In the 43 children with severe TBI who underwent postoperative brain MRI, the median GCS score on arrival was 4. The most common cause of injury was falls (14 patients, 33%). The most common primary intracranial pathology was subdural hematoma in 26 patients (60%), followed by epidural hematoma in 9 (21%). Fifteen patients (35%) had cerebral herniation and 31 (72%) had evidence of contusion. Variables associated with poor outcome included cerebral herniation (r = 0.338, p = 0.027) and location of DAI (r = 0.319, p = 0.037). In a separate analysis, brainstem DAI was shown to predict poor outcome, whereas location (no, superficial, or deep DAI) did not. Logistic regression showed that brainstem DAI (OR 22.3, p = 0.020) had a higher odds ratio than cerebral herniation (OR 10.5, p = 0.044) for poor outcome. Thirty-six children (84%) had a satisfactory outcome at last follow-up; 3 (7%) children died. CONCLUSIONS The majority of children in this series who presented with a severe TBI and underwent craniectomy or craniotomy made a satisfactory recovery. In patients in whom there is a concern for poor outcome, the location of DAI-type lesions with SWI and FLAIR may assist in prognostication. The authors' results revealed that DAI-type lesions in the brainstem and evidence of cerebral herniation may indicate a poorer prognosis; however, more studies with larger cohorts are needed to make definitive conclusions.

J	Katz, A; Agnon, A; Marco, S				Katz, Amitai; Agnon, Amotz; Marco, Shmuel			Earthquake-induced barium anomalies in the Lisan Formation, Dead Sea Rift valley, Israel	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Prominent barium concentration anomalies that appear within earthquake brecciated layers (seismites) in the late Pleistocene lacurstrine Lisan Formation in the Dead Sea Basin (DSB) are described and discussed here for the first time. Chemical analyses of samples from vertical profiles through the seismites display asymmetric Ba concentration peaks. The peaks start a few centimeters above the seismite's base and gradually rise to maxima reaching some 1000 ppm Ba, before falling off to background values (around 100 ppm), or abutting against the upper boundary of the breccia layer. High resolution SEM and electrcon microprobe analyses disclose that the Ba in the anomalies resides within prismatic crystallites (mostly <2 mu m in length) composed of a Ba(Sr)SO4 mineral (designated "BM" henceforth). These are lacking altogether in the normal (non-seismic) underlying and overlying sediments. The crystallites are much smaller than the adjacent, supporting matrix grains of the gradually-bedded seismite, and show no size-sorting relationship with the latter. The peaks of the anomalies reflect higher population density, rather than larger crystal sizes, of the BM crystallites therein. Mass balance calculations show that the mass of Ba2+ dissolved in the lake above a unit area of the seismites was mostly several times larger than that found in the seismite. The concentration of Ba2+ in DSB Ca-chloride brines is mostly lesser than that in the DSB Lake, ruling out the former as a source of Ba to the anomalies. We propose that, during earthquakes, the uppermost bottom sediment layers in the DSB Lake were shaken and re-suspended into the overlying brine. The larger, faster-settling fragments and grains remained almost intact or were rapidly removed, unaffected, from the slurry. However, the finer grains remained in suspension for longer periods, allowing nucleation and growth of BM crystallites on their surfaces from the surrounding brine before reaching the bottom. The lag of Ba trapping behind the breccia accumulation and the asymmetrical peak shapes of the anomalies are accounted for by decreasing dilution of the Ba-rich finer particles by Ba-poor coarse grains during seismite accumulation, as reflected by the graded bedding of the seismite layers. The supply rate of Ba2+ to the lake by freshwater and brines was more than sufficient to account for the buildup of Ba in recurring seismites separated by seismically quiescent intervals as short as 100 yr.

Although it is completely devoid of life, except for a few bacteria and algae, the climatic and geological conditions in the Dead Sea basin have produced circumstances which made this lake important for the economy of the area. The salt which was produced by evaporation of the water, or by quarrying from the salt diapir of Mt. Sodom, on the Dead Sea coast, is referred to in the Bible and in the Talmud. It was harvested until the 1930's. Potash has been extracted from the brine, by solar processes, since 1931 and today the Dead Sea is a major source of potash and bromine. The asphalt, which is found in seepages along the shores and in large blocks, occasionally found floating on the lake, has been used by the inhabitants of the area for waterproofing baskets and for decorative purpose, since the Pre-ceramic Neolithic Period, 10000 years ago. Later, the asphalt became a major export item to Egypt. During the Early Bronze age, 4000 years ago, it was used mostly to glue flint implements to wooden handles and in the Graeco-Roman period it was used as one of the components in the embalming of Egyptian mummies. The area around the Dead Sea was the only source of balsam, perhaps the most important incense and medication of the Ancient World. Remains of a 7th century B.C. perfume factory, were found in Ein Gedi. During later periods, until the Arab conquest in the 7th century A.D., the growing of balsam was an imperial monopoly. The area of the Dead Sea was famous, for over 2000 years, for its dates and sugar. The therapeutical and medicinal properties of Dead Sea water and the hypersaline hot springs on its shore, were famous throughout the Ancient World. For example, King Herod the Great, 2000 years ago, used to visit the area to cure his many diseases. This practice continues today, and the lakes has become a major center for treatment of psoriasis. There is pictorial, archaeological and historical evidence to support the Dead Sea's importance as a trade artery for over 2300 years.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					127	141		10.1007/BF00018795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018795													WOS:A1993MB13700009
J	Herbig, C; Sirocko, F				Herbig, Christoph; Sirocko, Frank			Palaeobotanical evidence for agricultural activities in the Eifel region during the Holocene: plant macro-remain and pollen analyses from sediments of three maar lakes in the Quaternary Westeifel Volcanic Field (Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz)	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												As a part of the ELSA-project (Eifel Laminated Sediment Archive) new pollen and plant macro-remain analyses have been carried out on a series of Holocene lacustrine sediments from three open maar lakes of the Quaternary Westeifel Volcanic Field. In combination with already existing pollen analyses, the archaeological record and written sources, the present study casts new light on settlement activities and henceforth the development of agriculture from the prehistoric to historic times in this region. While there are clues that wood pasturing was practised in the Eifel region from the Michelsberg Culture onwards (c. 4300 cal. b.c.), the Vulkaneifel is a remote area with relatively poor soils and a humid climate and was not constantly settled until the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, when cereal pollen was found regularly in the deposits. Plant macro-remains (chaff), which give us direct evidence for arable agriculture in the surroundings of the maars, were also found in layers belonging to the Early Bronze Age (c. 1900 cal. b.c.). At the same time we can observe the massive spread of Fagus sylvatica (beech) in all pollen diagrams, which was most probably caused by a combination of climatic, anthropogenic and competitive factors. Later impacts of agriculture were an abundance of crop weeds and pollen in the following Middle Bronze Age. Nevertheless human impact remained discontinuous until the Urnfield Culture (1200-800 cal. b.c.). A layer of weeds dating at the end of the Urnfield Culture was found and also flax (Linum usitatissimum) cultivation first becomes apparent. However, the subsequent Iron Age and Roman Period reveal only crop weeds and cereal pollen in slightly higher concentrations, but the abundance of Poaceae pollen at this time is most probably consistent with grazing activities. There follows compelling evidence of the importance of flax cultivation and processing at the maars from the Merovingian Period (5th century a.d.) onwards. A detailed insight into the agriculture of the High Medieval comes from flash flood layers of the 14th century a.d., where remains of Secale cereale (rye) and crop weeds reflect winter-sown cultivation of rye. Cannabis sativa (hemp) was also cultivated and processed during the medieval. Finally we can trace the Prussian reforestation in the 19th century a.d., with an increase in Pinus sylvestris (pine) and Picea abies (fir), by both pollen and plant macro-remains.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				NOV	2013	22	6					447	462		10.1007/s00334-012-0387-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-012-0387-6													WOS:000325709100001
J	Kleynhans, CJ				Kleynhans, CJ			The development of a fish index to assess the biological integrity of South African rivers	WATER SA												A biological integrity index that uses attributes of fish assemblages was developed and applied to a part of the Crocodile River (Incomati System, Mpumalanga Province). Fundamentally, the fish assemblage integrity index (FAII) is based on the fish species expected to be present in biological (fish habitat) segments which are sections of river with relatively homogeneous fish habitat. Within this framework fish are categorised according to an intolerance index which lakes into account trophic preferences and specialisation, habitat preferences and specialisation, requirement for flowing water during different life-stages and association with habitat with unmodified water quality. This intolerance index. the expected frequency of occurrence and expected health of fish species in a particular fish habitat segment was used to formulate an index for the situation expected under minimally impaired conditions which was used as the comparative basis for the observed (sampled) situation. The observed situation was expressed as a fraction of the expected situation to arrive at a relative FAII index value which was grouped into one of six descriptive fish assemblage integrity index classes. It was found that the index reflected several aspects of the modifications that have occurred in the Crocodile River, i.e. water quality modifications; flow modifications and introduction of alien fish. However, now releases from Kwena Dam hampered fish sampling while the floods that occurred in the summer prior to the survey, extensively modified physical habitat conditions that existed for some years. It was concluded that the index provides a broad, synoptic estimation of the biological integrity of the river. It is highly likely that the index in its current form provides an underestimation of the biological integrity due to the species expected to be present, being based on all species listed fora segment, and not on the fish species expected to be present in the habitats actually sampled. It is suggested that refinement of the index should include development of improved methodology;to determine not only the fish species expected per segment, but also species expected per habitat type. In its current form, the index to the potential to provide qualitative, descriptive criteria for the desired ecological condition or integrity of rivers for management purposes in terms of the new South African Water Law. The development of numerical criteria will, however, require development in terms of the statistical properties (i.e. statistical power) of the index.					kleynhans, cj/ISG-9009-2023														0378-4738	1816-7950				JUL	1999	25	3					265	278																WOS:000081780900001
J	Forster, RM; Schubert, H				Forster, RM; Schubert, H			The effects of ultraviolet radiation on the planktonic community of a shallow, eutrophic estuary: results of mesocosm experiments	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												This paper describes the results of pelagic mesocosm experiments designed to test the effects of enhanced and reduced ultraviolet radiation (UV) on the planktonic community of a Baltic Sea estuary. The Darss-Zingst estuary consists of a series of brackish lagoons with high concentrations of chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter. The shallow depth of the estuary ensures that organisms in the water are regularly exposed to high levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and UV. During the summer of 1995 and 1996, four 1-m(3) mesocosms were filled with water from the mid-point of the estuary. Each compartment was equipped with a pump to simulate natural rates of wind-induced vertical mixing. The mesocosms were hung in the estuary from a floating raft and were shielded from above by filters to give the spectral treatments PAR only, PAR+UV-A, and PAR+UV-A+UV-B. Enhanced levels of UV-B, i.e. twice that of midday sunlight, were provided in a further treatment by artificial sunlamps. Experi ments were conducted for periods of 3-14 days. No sig nificant effects of enhanced or reduced UV-B were observed on chlorophyll a concentrations or photosynthetic performance, although the PAR-only treatment did show higher final chlorophyll concentrations in two of the trials. Phytoplankton pigment composition was measured by in vivo absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra, and was similar in all mesocosm treatments indicating that there were no major differences in functional group composition. Bacterial secondary production rates as measured by thymidine incorporation increased with time in all mesocosms, probably due to enhanced production of phytoplankton exudate. There was evidence for a small depression of secondary production by enhanced UV-B, but only on certain days. Microzooplankton generally increased in all mesocosms to population densities higher than those observed in the estuary, and tended to reach higher final values in the mesocosms exposed to UV. It is concluded that vertical mixing which reduces the residence time of planktonic organisms in the surface layers, and high concentrations of chromophoric, dissolved organic matter, which greatly reduce the penetration of UV-B, combined to protect the planktonic community from UV-B damage.					; Forster, Rodney/J-1756-2019	Forster, Rodney/0000-0001-6990-1673; 													1438-387X	1438-3888					2001	55	1					23	34		10.1007/s101520000058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101520000058													WOS:000167849700004
J	Cruikshank, K; Bouchier, NB				Cruikshank, K; Bouchier, NB			'The heritage of the people closed against them': Class, environment, and the shaping of Burlington Beach, 1870s-1980s	URBAN HISTORY REVIEW-REVUE D HISTOIRE URBAINE												Following serious flooding in the 1970s, Hamilton, Ontario politicians and planners sought to transform the Burlington Beach area into a recreational parkland. This dream was not a new one. One hundred years earlier, Hamilton social and political leaders also had envisioned the area, with its fine lakeside beaches and scenic bayside shoreline, as a recreational area. In the 1870s they consciously took control of this small fishing and farming community, contending that the area should be preserved for 'the health and welfare of the people'. The people, it turned out, were well-to-do residents eager to create a private summer refuge from the beat, dirt, and people of an industrializing city. Within a generation, however, city residents of more modest means challenged 'the aristocratic seclusion' of the beach, and successfully struggled to create beaches and parks that would be open to a wider public. Not for long. Within another generation, the beach strip ceased to be an attractive recreational area. Working Hamiltonians saw it as a site for relatively inexpensive housing, and expanded the private residential community. They helped to build the unique community that would frustrate a new generation of recreational promoters in the 1970s. Residents of the community had inherited the private property claims and rights that city politicians had fostered in the area since the 1870s, and forced politicians and planners of the 1970s and 1980s to adopt an alternative vision of the beach strip. This paper traces the struggle of social groups to create and enforce their vision of the beach, a struggle that was in turn shaped by the particular urban and industrial development of the Hamilton region between the 1870s and 1980s. The environmental transformation of this strip of land, and the degradation of the waters surrounding it, affected the ways in which social groups perceived the beach and the purposes it might serve. Its history provides insights into the interaction of leisure, class, and the environment in an industrial city.																			0703-0428					OCT	2001	30	1					40	55		10.7202/1015941ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/1015941ar													WOS:000172951800003
J	Vanni, MJ; Layne, CD; Arnott, SE				Vanni, MJ; Layne, CD; Arnott, SE			''Top-down'' trophic interactions in lakes: Effects of fish on nutrient dynamics	ECOLOGY												We conducted enclosure experiments over two summers in Tuesday Lake, Michigan, to assess how a gradient of zooplanktivorous fish biomass affected the dynamics of nutrients (nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P), and their partitioning among ecosystem compartments. In both years, fish (the cyprinid Phoxinus eos) reduced the abundance of large zooplankton species and increased the biomass of phytoplankton as predicted by the top-down control hypothesis. Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of N and P. Total P concentrations in the water column declined over time in all enclosures, but fish slowed the rate of decline. Thus total water column P increased with increasing fish biomass. Total N increased less strongly with increasing fish biomass, and thus the total N:P ratio decreased with increasing fish biomass. The concentrations of particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the water column also increased with increased fish biomass. Particulate N:P ratio decreased with increased fish biomass, but effects were weaker compared to effects on total N:P ratios. Nutrient ratios of the zooplankton fraction (particles >63 mu m) showed a response that was transient but consistent with observed trends in zooplankton species composition. In particular, when the large cladocerans Daphnia and Holopedium increased upon exclusion of fish, C:P and N:P ratios of the zooplankton fraction showed distinct declines, corresponding to the relatively high body P contents of these taxa. Phosphorus budgets revealed that fish were a net source of P to the water column, because they lost mass during the experiments, even at densities below those in the lake. However, loss of P from fish could not account for the higher total P concentration observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. The absolute amount of P sinking from the water column increased with increasing fish biomass but decreased when expressed as percentage of total P sinking, again suggesting that the presence of fish increases the relative retention of P the water column. The rate of decline in water column total P in the presence of fish was accurately predicted by sedimentation of P from the water column and other fluxes. Our results support the hypothesis that fish can exert major influences on the dynamics, distribution, and ratios of limiting nutrients.

The varve, on average, ca. 1.5 mm thick, consists of light-and dark-green laminae sets, and is predominately composed of planktonic diatoms. Several facies types of sediment gravity-flow deposits are intercalated in the varved diatomite. In this study, we examined the sedimentary facies, lateral changes, and stratigraphic variations of these sediment gravity-flow deposits. In addition, we also analyzed a time series of varve thickness fluctuations. Based on their sedimentary facies, composition, and diatom species, sediment gravity-flow deposits in the varved diatomite can be classified as flood-generated or slope-failure-generated. Sedimentary facies analysis indicates that the slope-failure deposits were deposited by slope failure within the lake. Since no significant segregation of rip-up clasts is observed in the deposits, a proximal depositional setting at the base of the lake slope is suggested. The flood-generated deposits have eroded lower contacts, which indicate deposition by hyperpycnal flows. In contrast, deposits with no basal erosion indicate deposition by homopycnal or hypopycnal flows. The thickness time series of the varve shows a thickening-upward trend indicating an increase in diatom production or in diatom shells sizes. Running mean thicknesses show non-stationary periodicities of 200-500 y. The frequency of the deposit varies, but is approximately 10 events per 400 y. Flood deposits in the middle part of the section are dominated by volcaniclastic silt. This suggests that vegetation around the lake was reduced by ash fall, resulting in frequent flood events during this interval. The frequency and thickness of slope failure deposits increases in the lower part of the succession, together with the occurrence of slump scars. The frequency of the deposits in the upper part of the section is approximately 100-500 y, similar to the postulated interval at activity of the nearby Yamasaki Fault System. The results of this study improve our knowledge of paleoenvironmental changes in the study site, and also provide new criteria for classifying sediment gravity-flow deposits in lacustrine sedimentary cores.

Fluvial responses to late Holocene hydroclimate variability in the midcontinental United States	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Long-term relationships between mean-state climatic conditions and flood frequencies in the mid -continental United States (US) are not well established because instrumental records of fluvial processes are limited to the current warm period (CWP; the last ca. 150 years) and continuous paleo-flood records are exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate climate-flood relationships in the midcontinental US by reconstructing flood frequencies at Half Moon Pond, a 1600-year-old oxbow lake on the lower White River, Indiana (watershed 1/4 ca, 29,000 km2). We used sediment accumulation rates and clastic fluxes constrained by high-resolution radiocarbon (14C) dating. Frequent flooding, as indicated by high sedi-mentation rates and clastic fluxes to Half Moon Pond, occurred leading up to and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950-1250 CE) when paleoclimate records suggest the predominance of ocean -atmosphere mean states resembling the negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (-PDO-like) and Pacific North American Mode (-PNA-like). Reductions in sedimentation rates and clastic fluxes, indicating reduced flooding, subsequently occurred during the transition out of the MCA and into the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1250-1830 CE) as ocean-atmosphere conditions shifted to + PDO-like and +PNA-like mean states. Sedimentation rates and clastic fluxes increased again after ca. 1800 CE, indicating increased flooding during the CWP as ocean-atmosphere conditions returned to-PDO-like and-PNA-like mean states. The White River trends were notably antiphased with sedimentation-rate-based flood frequencies for the lower Ohio River (500,000 km2 watershed) prior to 1830 CE. This antiphased relationship is consistent with flooding in moderate to small watersheds in the Midwest being sensitive to the occur-rence of rainstorm events, which were more frequent leading up to and during the MCA, and flooding in large watersheds being more sensitive to large spring melts associated with extensive snowpacks, which characterized the LIA. That both the White and Ohio rivers experienced their most frequent flooding during the CWP suggests deforestation and changing land use practices increased flooding on Mid-western watersheds across scales despite a current climatic mean state that in the past only resulted in increased flooding on moderate to small watersheds. Continued increased in midcontinental rainfall are therefore likely to enhance the occurrence of floods in Midwestern watersheds across different geographic scales.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Longmore, ME; Heijnis, H				Longmore, ME; Heijnis, H			Aridity in Australia: Pleistocene records of Palaeohydrological and Palaeoecological change from the perched lake sediments of Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A Quaternary sedimentary sequence (ca. 600 ka) from a perched lake (Old Lake Coomboo Depression) on the World Heritage-listed coastal sandmass of Fraser Island has been analysed for dry bulk density, carbonised particles, pollen and chemistry. A chronology has been constructed for the organic sediments using a combination of radiocarbon and uranium/thorium disequilibrium analysis. The lake basin is small (ca. 9 ha) with a restricted groundwater catchment, delimited by an aquitard, and minimal surface runoff. It therefore acts as a sensitive raingauge with the perched groundwater-table, and hence the sediment facies deposited within the lake, reacting sensitively to any changes in the water budget. The sequence passes through a series of glacial cycles, demonstrating hydrologic and vegetation change. The record indicates a long-term, three-stage fall in the water-table from lake-full ca. 600 ka to an ephemeral lake in the Holocene, paralleled by a shift in the vegetation composition from predominantly rainforest to sclerophyllous components. The evidence for fire is minimal at the beginning of the record, increases from >350 ka through the sequence culminating at or before the LGM, is low during the LGM and is relatively high during the Holocene. Succession, fire and climatic change, along with the accumulative effect of a series of 100 ka cycles, are believed to have driven the hydrologic and vegetation change and a human factor is not required to explain the record. Within the overall long-term increase in aridity recorded through about six glacial cycles, there appears to be a variation in the 'dryness' signal of glacial maxima, suggesting some form of 'supercycle' phenomenon. This record complements and extends the information available from some of the oldest pollen-analysed Quaternary lake sequences in Australasia, such as Lynch's Crater in the Atherton Tableland of north Queensland and Lake George in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales; and from some of the most sensitive lacustrine/ fluvial sedimentary records in the Lake Lyre basin. Signals for major environmental changes recorded in deep sea cores and the loess deposits of China may also be represented in the record. The implications of the Depression record, if further corroborated, are significant in relation to climatic modelling, rainforest survival and faunal extinction. (C) 1999 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

The melting of Folgefonna has implications for meltwater drainage and hydropower production, as well as the potential for geohazards and impacts to tourism, the communities and infrastructures surrounding the glacier. To support future adaptation strategies, we need to know the subglacial topography of the ice caps to identify water divides and possible areas for geohazards. Therefore, we mapped the subglacial topography at Sorfonna, the largest of the Folgefonna ice caps, using an ice-penetrating radar (2.5 MHz antennas; 1,000 x 500 m grid). The results show a highly irregular subglacial landscape, with deep valleys and high mountain peaks. The maximum ice thickness is 570 m and the mean ice thickness is 190 m. We examined the retreat pattern of Sorfonna using the subglacial topography map in combination with a simple ice flow model and simulated the ice retreat 150 years into the future. We used two climate scenarios (one with a 1.5 degrees C warming and a 3% increase in precipitation, and a second with a 3.5 degrees C warming together with 15% increase in precipitation) and focused on how the glacial retreat will cause hydrological changes in the catchments surrounding the glacier. The main drainage pattern shifts during glacial retreat, with a larger proportion of southward drainage compared to the present day. The ice flow modelling also reveals that the southern part of Sorfonna is more durable during climate change whereas the thinner part of the ice cap, in the north, melts faster. We suggest that increased winter precipitation in a future warmer climate makes the southern part of Sorfonna more resilient than many other glaciers in southern Norway. The subglacial topography map and the retreat pattern also reveal areas that may accumulate water and could potentially generate a future glacial outburst flood. Sediments from distal glacier-fed lakes around Sorfonna have been used to constrain the thresholds identified on the subglacial topography map. Combining sedimentological evidence from distal glacier-fed lakes with the new subglacial topography map confirms that the retreat of specific outlet glaciers, such as Bondhusbreen, Buerbreen, and Mosevassbreen, will have a large impact on meltwater routing, as they are situated behind bedrock thresholds in the upper part of the glacier's catchment area.

Shallow subaqueous to emergent intra-caldera silicic volcanism of the Motuoapa Peninsula, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand-New constraints from geologic mapping, sedimentology and zircon geochronology	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Motuoapa Peninsula, located in the southeast of the Taupo Volcanic Centre, New Zealand, is dominated by a silicic pyroclastic cone and overlaying lavas. The pyroclastic succession has not been recognised and studied before, and its thickness and sedimentological characteristics indicate completely different eruption mechanisms than proposed for the other pyroclastic successions within the central Taupo Volcanic Zone. Here, we present the results of field mapping and sedimentological characterisation of accessible pyroclastic deposits, and complement these data with combined U-Th and (U-Th)/He zircon geochronology providing first constraints on the succession's crystallization and eruption history. (U-Th)/He zircon eruption ages of 77.2 +/- 6.3, 81.3 +/- 9.2 and 34.5 +/- 3.1 ka indicate that volcanic activity in the Motuoapa Peninsula occurred in two distinct eruptive episodes that were separated by ca. 45 kyrs. The earlier rhyolitic eruption at ca. 80 ka is inferred to have commenced in a shallow subaqueous environment. Its lowermost succession includes breccias and tuff breccias sourced from an extruding lava dome by autobrecciation, quench-fragmentation and localised debris flows. With gradual emergence of the growing volcanic pile, explosive hydrovolcanic activity became dominant, constructing an emergent cone by pyroclastic density currents and fall-out. The lack of exotic/accidental clasts, along with an abundance of low-vesicularity rhyolitic juvenile fragments, suggests fragmentation driven by magma-water interaction, which predominantly occurred at shallow depths within the outgassed part of the ascending magma. The frequency and thickness of ash-dominated units increases upwards, suggesting a gradual increase in explosive energy of tephra jets. The final phase of the rhyolitic activity was dominated by emplacement of viscous lava that breached the crater rim and flowed onto the SE sector of the pyroclastic cone. The remnant of the Motuoapa pyroclastic cone, along with the bedded structure of deposits that comprise fallout and surge-dominated units, appears very similar to Surtseyan tuff cones and silicic tuff/pumice cones described elsewhere. A dacitic eruption that produced a nearby lava dome at ca. 35 ka, represents a significantly younger event that occurred after substantial erosion of the earlier pyroclastic cone. The Motuoapa Peninsula deposits most likely record the evolution of a subaqueous silicic eruption, where hydrovolcanism played a fundamental role on subaerial pyroclastic cone formation in a terrestrial environment with abundant surface water availability.

J	Scott, HEM; Aherne, J				Scott, Heidi E. M.; Aherne, Julian			Mercury concentrations in Irish headwater lake catchments	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												An estimated 215,000 tonnes of mercury (Hg) have been emitted to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources since the nineteenth century, igniting widespread environmental monitoring owing to its toxicity. The environmental fate of Hg is strongly determined by catchment characteristics, especially soil organic matter. In this study, concentrations and pools of Hg were determined for lakes and soils in upland peat-dominated catchments in Ireland to assess controls of aquatic Hg and soil response to changes in emissions. Headwater lakes in upland coastal regions were surveyed for water chemistry and total Hg (THg) during spring 2008. In addition, a sub-set of lakes (n = 5) were repeatedly sampled during 2009-2011, and their surface soils collected for Hg analysis, including a short (30 cm) peat core to assess temporal Hg fluxes using radiometric Pb-210 dating. Peat cores indicated a significant decrease in Hg deposition since the 1980s, in broad agreement with other 'background' regions. Total Hg was correlated with total organic carbon (TOC) in the survey and intensive study lakes (r = 0.70 and 0.45), indicative of the strong affinity of Hg to organic matter. At the intensive lakes, monomethylmercury (MMHg) made up 3.3 % of mean THg and exhibited a positive correlation with total SO4 (2-) (r = 0.55). Further, both THg and MMHg were significantly correlated with conductivity (r = 0.48 and 0.54, respectively) potentially owing to marine inputs, and negatively correlated with pH (r = -0.59 and -0.56 respectively). Significant differences in THg (and MMHg) were observed between the five lakes, the highest concentrations (4.45 and 0.16 ng L-1, respectively) tended to be associated with TOC in lakes and occurred at sites in the northwest, characterized by higher levels of soil organic matter (peat) and soil moisture relative to the other sites. In contrast, surface soil pools of THg ranged between 13.6 and 20.8 mu g m(-2) across study sites and did not vary significantly, but were typical of global background regions. Nonetheless, the organic rich soils that dominate Ireland are a natural sink for THg, and peat harvesting for energy production may release long-term stores of Hg from deeper soil layers.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2013	116	1-3					161	173		10.1007/s10533-013-9885-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-013-9885-6													WOS:000328197800012

The Missoula and Bonneville floods-A review of ice-age megafloods in the Columbia River basin	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington State, USA, brought megafloods to the scientific forefront. A 30,000-km(2) landscape of coulees and cataracts carved into the region's loess-covered basalt attests to overwhelming volumes of energetic water. The scarred landscape, garnished by huge boulder bars and far-travelled ice-rafted erratics, spurred J Harlen Bretz's vigorously disputed flood hypothesis in the 1920s. First known as the Spokane flood, it was rebranded the Missoula flood once understood that the water came from glacial Lake Missoula, formed when the Purcell Trench lobe of the last-glacial Cordilleran ice sheet dammed the Clark Fork valley in northwestern Idaho with ice a kilometer thick. Bretz's flood evidence in the then-remote Channeled Scabland, once widely seen and elaborated by the 1950s, eventually swayed consensus for cataclysmic flooding. Missoula flood questions then turned to some that continue today: how many? when? how big? what routes? what processes? The Missoula floods passed through eastern Washington by a multitude of valleys, coulees and scabland tracts, some contemporaneously, some sequentially. Routings and their timing depended on the positions of various lobes of the multi-pronged Cordilleran ice sheet and the erosional development of the channels themselves. The first floods mostly followed the big bend of Columbia valley looping through north-central Washington. But the south-advancing Okanogan ice lobe soon blocked that path, forming long-lasting glacial Lake Columbia in the impounded Columbia valley. Missoula floods into this lake were diverted south out of the Columbia valley and into eastern Washington coulees and scabland tracts. At least four floods entered Moses Coulee, but then as the Okanogan lobe advanced over and blocked the head of that coulee, more eastern paths took the water, including Grand Coulee and the Telford-Crab-Creek and Cheney-Palouse scabland tracts. Flood routing also depended on the erosion of the coulees. At some point, headward erosion of upper Grand Coulee lowered the divide saddle between the west-running Columbia valley and the deep and wide Grand Coulee heading southwest. Still uncertain is when this happened and the consequences with respect to the stage and extent of glacial Lake Columbia and to flood access to the other, higher, flood routes. Downstream, all flood routes converged into Pasco Basin, flowed through Wallula Gap and the Columbia River Gorge into the Pacific Ocean, following submarine canyons and depositing sediment layers on abyssal plains. Stratigraphic studies indicate dozens-likely more than a hundred-of separate Missoula floods during the last glacial period. Over the length of the flood route, backwater areas and depositional basins preserve multiple flood beds, many of which are separated by signs of time, including volcanic ash layers and soil development in subaerial environments; and varve-like beds and pelagic mud layers in lacustrine and marine settings. Evidence also comes from the glacial Lake Missoula basin, where stratigraphy indicates dozens of filling and emptying cycles. Varve counts in conjunction with radiocarbon dating and paleomagnetic secular variation show the repeated filling-and-release cycles of glacial Lake Missoula had intervals possibly as long as 100 years early in the lake's history but diminished to just one or two years for the last few floods. This behavior accords with jokulhlaup-style floods released by subglacial drainage from a self-dumping ice-dammed lake. Not yet clear is whether such a mechanism applies to all the floods or if some emptied more cataclysmically as hypothesized by some. Radiocarbon dating of sparse organic materials remains key to defining flood chronology but has been lately bolstered by analyses of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides and optically stimulated luminescence. Varve counts and paleomagnetic secular variation studies help to define durations and intervals represented by sequences of flood beds. The similar to 16 ka Mount St. Helens Set S tephra is commonly interbedded within flood deposits, enabling correlation of deposits among sites. Tephra from the 13.7-13.4 ka eruption of Glacier Peak overlies all glacial Lake Missoula and Missoula flood deposits, defining an end time. Overall conclusions are that glacial Lake Missoula was extant and producing floods for at least 3-4 ky during 20-14 ka. At least similar to 75 floods preceded Mount St Helens Set S, followed by 30 or more after the tephra fall. Most floods entered glacial Lake Columbia, impounded by the Okanogan lobe, for 2-5 ky between about 18.5 and 15 ka. Glacial Lake Columbia outlived Lake Missoula by > 200-400 yr but may have been born later since at least one flood came down the Columbia valley before the Okanogan ice lobe blocked the Columbia valley at 18.5-18 ka. The maximum extent of the Okanogan and Purcell Trench lobes, many Missoula floods, substantial erosion of upper Grand Coulee, and the widespread tephra falls from Mount St. Helens eruptions all happened about 17-15 ka. People, in the area since 16.6-15.3 ka, almost certainly witnessed the last of the Missoula floods and later large floods from other icedammed lakes in the Columbia River basin. Quantitative flow analyses give peak discharge estimates and support understanding of erosional and depositional processes. The first flow assessments were simple cross-section calculations but recent assessments employ two-dimensional hydrodynamic models. The general finding is that emplacement of the maximum stage evidence requires about 20 million m(3)/s near the Lake Missoula outlet and about 5-15 million m(3)/s through Wallula Gap and downstream in the Columbia River Gorge. These hydraulic analyses raise still-unresolved questions regarding canyon erosion and possible additional water sources. The large Pleistocene Bonneville flood entered the Columbia River system from the southeast from pluvial Lake Bonneville, the Pleistocene predecessor to Great Salt Lake in the eastern Great Basin. During the last glacial, the lake basin filled, covering > 50,000 km(2) with 10,400 km(3) of water before reaching its maximum possible stage governed by Red Rock Pass, the lowest divide separating the basin from the Snake River basin to the north. The overtopping lake rapidly incised 108-125 m into the Red Rock Pass outlet, spilling half of its total lake volume. G.K. Gilbert described the essential sequence in the 1870s, but the flood was mostly forgotten until the late 1950s when Harold Malde linked the spectacular scabland topography and bouldery "melon gravel" on the Snake River Plain to the Lake Bonneville overflow. The Bonneville flood appears to have been a singular event at about 18 ka. No evidence of multiple or pre-last-glacial spillovers has yet been found. Its total volume was about twice that of a maximum Lake Missoula flood yet its peak discharge was similar to 1 million m(3)/s, less than a tenth of the largest Missoula floods. Its comparatively simple flow path and much steadier flow make the Bonneville flood ideal for new studies of erosional and depositional processes. At least two floods seem to have passed down the Columbia valley after the last of the Missoula floods, including a large flood about similar to 14 ka likely from cataclysmic demise of the thinning Okanogan ice lobe dam impounding glacial Lake Columbia. Floods from earlier glacial ages left scant yet clear evidence in the Channeled Scabland and Columbia valley. But their source, timing, and magnitudes are little understood. Some deposits are paleomagnetically reversed, thus older than similar to 800 ka. Last-glacial floods and perhaps older ones affected the Snake River Plain, some likely sourced in lakes dammed by alpine glaciers in central Idaho.

J	Pierson, DC; Strömbeck, N				Pierson, DC; Strömbeck, N			Estimation of radiance reflectance and the concentrations of optically active substances in Lake Malaren, Sweden, based on direct and inverse solutions of a simple model	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A semi-analytical model which predicts radiance reflectance just below the water surface (L-u/E-d 0 -) has been developed and used to predict the spectral variability of radiance reflectance in Lake Malaren, Sweden. Radiance reflectance is predicted as a function of the optically active substances in the water, which include the concentrations of chlorophyll-a + phaeophytin-a, suspended particular inorganic material (SPIM), suspended particulate organic material (SPOM), and dissolved yellow substances. These substances are linked to the absorption and backscattering coefficients through a series of empirical relationships, and ultimately radiance reflectance is estimated as a function of the ratio of backscattering to absorption. Parameterization of the model, i.e. the development of the empirical relationships linking the optically active substances to the inherent optical properties (IOPs), is based on both in situ measurements and laboratory analyses. We have collected data that allowed us to examine the potential variability in radiance reflectance, as predicted by our model, due to both variations in the optically active substances, and in the model parameterization. Simulations based on a data set collected during the fall of 1997 from 12 sites, which span a large range in water quality (secchi depth 0.8-5.0 m), suggest that, with the proper parameterization, the model can accurately predict the spectra of radiance reflectance as a function of the concentration of optically active substances. Variations in the concentrations of optically active substances accounted for a large portion of the total simulated variability in radiance reflectance (i.e. that resulting from variations in parameterization and in the concentrations of optically active substances). However, the measured variability in parameterization could account for up to 50% of the total variability in simulated radiance reflectance. This suggests that variability in the model parameterization, arising from both real variability and experimental error, will limit the use of this model for interpreting remote sensing data. Nevertheless, inverse solutions of the model are able to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll, suspended inorganic material (SPIM) and the absorption of yellow substances from measured radiance reflectance spectra The average error for the 12 sites was a -0.07 for chlorophyll, -0.15 for dissolved yellow substances (measured as the absorption at 400 nm) and 0.07 for SPIM, even though individual errors could be as great as 50%.

J	Green, AN				Green, A. N.			Palaeo-drainage, incised valley fills and transgressive systems tract sedimentation of the northern KwaZulu-Natal continental shelf, South Africa, SW Indian Ocean	MARINE GEOLOGY												Two sequence boundaries are recognised in seismic data collected from the narrow northern KwaZulu-Natal continental shelf. These correspond to late Cretaceous and latest Pleistocene-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) periods of sea-level fall where fluvial incision into the shelf resulted in several incised valleys having formed. In both examples, the ensuing transgressive valley fills document an evolution from fluvially dominant sedimentation to classic backbarrier estuarine conditions. Central estuary basin sedimentation is most prominent within each fill and is separated from the underlying fluvial sediments by bayline ravinement processes. Tidal-ravinement surfaces separate the upper estuarine sequences from barrier and shoreface deposition, most easily observed in the latest Pleistocene/Holocene valley fills where a Holocene unconsolidated sediment wedge overlies the estuarine fill. The wedge itself is characterised by two packages of sediment separated by a regionally occurring wave/shoreface transgressive ravinement surface which crops out as a semi-indurated shell hash in the mid to outer shelf Late Cretaceous examples are capped by deposits exhibiting oblique parallel to wavy reflectors interpreted as increasingly energetic deposits analogous to flood-tide deltaic sedimentation. Valley incision and fill are linked to two onshore coastal lake systems. Lake Sibaya and Lake St Lucia and appear to be the product of barrier breaching and fluvial readjustment to baseline shifting of these systems during forced regression. Lake St Lucia exhibits a composite palaeo-drainage channel where both sequence boundaries merge within the lake margins. Lake Sibaya has two distinct palaeo-channels for each sequence boundary episode, a late Cretaceous channel which fed a small incised valley within which a modern day submarine canyon is located, the other an LGM channel directed in towards the head of Wright Canyon. the subsequent input of sediment causing this canyon to breach furthest into the shelf than any other canyon in the area. Offshore of Lake St Lucia. the most proximal portions of the associated Leven Canyon occupy the mid shelf and are underlain by Lake St Lucia palaeo-drainage channels of LGM age where erosion along the initial LGM palaeo-channel has occurred. Freshwater exchange between the shelf and the fringing lake system has resulted in the development of sinuous features of Leven Canyon which have eroded in a downslope-fluvial like manner, thus occupying palaeo-drainage lows as erosive flows were entrained. Models proposed here indicate that 1) the limited accommodation space offered by a narrow continental shelf may allow for a greater preservation potential of wave-dominated estuarine facies: 2) the seismic expression of these fills may vary, yet still satisfy similar sedimentological conditions and 3) antecedent valley topography increases the preservation potential of these valley fills by providing a preferred space in which to re-incise and then fill during sea-level rise.

J	Buynevich, IV; FitzGerald, DM				Buynevich, Ilya V.; FitzGerald, Duncan M.			Organic-Rich Facies in Paraglacial Barrier Lithosomes of Northern New England: Preservation and Paleoenvironmental Significance	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Geological controls on the origin and preservation of organic-rich fades in Holocene barrier sequences of northern New England are documented using sedimentological and geophysical databases. In addition to backbarrier marsh interfingering with washover/aeolian deposits, several distinct modes of organic accumulation are recognized in association with elastic barrier facies. These include: 1) basal lake gyttja or wetland peats (thickness: 0.1-2.5 m); 2) intra-barrier saltwater/freshwater horizons (0.01-1.2 m); and 3) foreshore peat exposures (up to 1.2 m). Freshwater peat and gyttja underlying bather lithosomes below contemporaneous Mid-Holocene sea level suggest extensive backbarrier lake and wetlands, possibly due to a wetter climate. Present freshwater organics accumulate up to several meters below lake level, which is controlled by the elevation of groundwater table and, over the long term, sea level trends. In some areas, the saltwater-freshwater peat transition is attributed to cessation of long-term saltwater input into the backbarrier, commonly as a result of tidal inlet closure, rather than relative sea-level fall. The association of well-preserved tree stumps and saltmarsh peat exposed on the foreshore suggests drowning of the upland fringe by rising sea level around 2.5-3.0 ka BP and subsequent barrier rollover. Whereas basal ages of high-marsh peats are conventionally used for sea-level reconstruction, radiocarbon dates of the top portions of in-situ organic units may provide near-maximum ages of burial by barrier sediments. This information is independent of compaction and type of dated material and may be used to estimate the timing of barrier emplacement at or near its present position. Age estimates are less constrained when dating allochtonous organic material, but may still provide upper age limits for overlying elastic sequences. Similar to other mid- to high-latitude coastal settings, parts of maritime bogs and ponds in mid-coastal Maine have been buried episodically by storm overwash or dune migration over the past 5,000 years. The chronology of these events varies over a short distance along the coast as a function of bather exposure and morphology, antecedent geology, and changes in sediment supply and vegetation cover.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2002					36		109	117																WOS:000209071900013
J	Jarcho, S; Van Burkalow, A				Jarcho, Saul; Van Burkalow, Anastasia			A GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY OF "SWIMMERS' ITCH" IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA	GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												A skin eruption developing after swimming or wading in certain lakes in midwestern U.S. and Canada, known technically as "cercarial or schistosome dermatitis" is a disease of place; that is, it can be acquired only at certain places and is not communicable from person to person. Its occurrence is more severe in children who wade in shallow onshore waters where the larvae are most abundant than in adults. Mechanism of transmission involves the trematode worm; the definitive host, either bird or mammal; intermediate host, a snail; and man, an accidental intruder into the cycle. This is a 4-factor complex and may involve a 5th, bacteria, when secondary infection occurs. The major endemic area extends from parts of the U.S. near the Great Lakes north-west into Canada. The general distr. of reported cases suggests that infection of snails occurs during migration of aquatic birds, and that outlying foci arise by crossing over of birds from one flyway to another. Reported cases in Tenn. Valley Authority, where migratory waterfowl were formerly uncommon, coincides with increased use of this area by birds from the Mississippi flyway. Cases of proved cercarial dermatitis are acquired in lakes; rivers are less favorable and there are no proven marine cases. Physical environmental factors influencing dermatitis distr. are the multitude of lakes and sloughs within the area of Pleistocene glaciation. Here lies the breeding grounds of migratory water-fowl, the center of the present distr. of the fresh-water pulmonate mollusca, and environments more or less favorable for the schistosomes, including the most important Stagnicola emarginata. Larger glacial lakes with clear water and sandy beaches relatively free of vegetation are suitable habitats. Chemical composition of water is important in limiting distr. of snail and cercarial dermatitis; neutral or moderately acid pH is less favorable than where pH is on alkaline side. Wave-swept beaches are unsuitable; snails and dermatitis are more widely distr. on leeward shores. Max. infection of dermatitis occurs in mid-July to August during the warmer season. Incidence of schisto-some infection of snail hosts varies. This may be due to variation in number and distr. of snails, to pollution of water, the migratory behavior of bird hosts, and the habits of man. Human factors influencing the distr. of the dermatitis include the increased use of automobiles and development of roads which make lakes more accessible to a greater number of people; this provides a rise in the number of cases of cercarial dermatitis in the "silent zone" or areas where the definitive and intermediate hosts exist. Swimmers prefer lakes with sandy rather than muddy bottoms and it is in the sandy environment that the pathogenic complex is completed. Voluntary controls include: restriction of swimming in endemic areas which is undesirable for recreational and financial reasons; control of the static host, the snail, by use of Cu which may be impractical in large lakes. Involuntary influences on distribution by bird hosts has been brought about by reduction of breeding grounds through agriculture, lowering of water table, and by introduction of carp. In spite of decreasing waterfowl population, cases of swimmers'' itch are increasing. This is partially due to increased use of larger lakes by birds, and the impounding of water for various purposes. Thus the silent zone of cercarial dermatitis is spreading farther south, and more summer visitors are gaining access to lakes in the northern endemic areas.																			0016-7428	1931-0846				APR	1952	42	2					212	226		10.2307/211386	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/211386													WOS:000206047400004

Vertical stratification of physical, chemical and biological components in two saline lakes Shira and Shunet (South Siberia, Russia)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A feature of meromictic lakes is that several physicochemical and biological gradients affect the vertical distribution of different organisms. The vertical stratification of physical, chemical and biological components in saline, fishless meromictic lakes Shira and Shunet (Siberia, Russia) is quite different mainly because both mean depth and maximum depth of lakes differ as well as their salinity levels differ. The chemocline of the Lake Shira, as in many meromictic lakes, is inhabited by bacterial community consisting of purple sulphur and heterotrophic bacteria. As the depth of the chemocline is variable, the bacterial community does not attain high densities. The mixolimnion in Lake Shira, which is thermally stratified in summer, also creates different habitat for various species. The distribution of phytoplankton is non-uniform with its biomass peak in the metalimnion. The distribution of zooplankton is also heterogeneous with rotifers and juvenile copepods inhabiting the warmer epilimnion and older copepods found in the cold but oxic hypolimnion. The amphipod Gammarus lacustris which can be assigned to the higher trophic link in the fishless lake's ecosystem, such as Lake Shira, is also distributed non-uniformly, with its peak density generally observed in the thermocline region. The chemocline in Lake Shunet is located at the depth of 5 m, and unlike in Lake Shira, due to a sharp salinity gradient between the mixolimnion and monimolimnion, this depth is very stable. The mixolimnion in Lake Shunet is relatively shallow and the chemocline is inhabited by (1) an extremely dense bacterial community; (2) a population of Cryptomonas sp.; and (3) ciliate community comprising several species. As the mixolimnion of Lake Shunet is not thermally stratified for long period, the phytoplankton and zooplankton populations are not vertically stratified. The gammarids, however, tend to concentrate in a narrow layer located 1-2 m above the chemocline. We believe that in addition to vertical inhomogeneities of both physicochemical parameters, biological and physical factors also play a role in maintaining these inhomogeneities. We conclude that the stratified distributions of the major food web components will have several implications for ecosystem structure and dynamics. Trophic interactions as well as mass and energy flows can be significantly impacted by such heterogeneous distributions. Species spatially separated even by relatively short distances, say a few centimetres will not directly compete. Importantly, we demonstrate that not only bacteria, phytoflagellates and ciliate tend to concentrate in thin layers but also larger-sized species such Gammarus (amphipods) can also under certain environmental conditions have stratified distribution with maxima in relatively thin layer. As the vertical structure of the lake ecosystem is rather complex in such stratified lakes as ours, the strategy of research, including sampling techniques, should consider potentially variable and non-homogeneous distributions.					; Zadereev, Egor/J-2200-2012; Barkhatov, Yuri/T-6681-2017; Mooij, Wolf/C-2677-2008; Gulati, Ramesh/F-4943-2013; Andrei, Degermendzhi/P-8042-2015; Prokopkin, Igor/T-2023-2017; Tolomeev, Aleksandr/I-9601-2018; Rogozin, Denis/AAE-8113-2019	Tolomeev, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9124-4566; Barkhatov, Yuri/0000-0003-4547-0439; Mooij, Wolf/0000-0001-5586-8200; Andrei, Degermendzhi/0000-0001-8649-5419; Zadereev, Egor/0000-0003-2366-8604; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2010	44	3					619	632		10.1007/s10452-010-9336-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9336-6													WOS:000285338600011
J	Starratt, SW				Starratt, Scott W.			Holocene climate on the Modoc Plateau, northern California, USA: the view from Medicine Lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Medicine Lake is a small (165 ha), relatively shallow (average 7.3 m), intermediate elevation (2,036 m) lake located within the summit caldera of Medicine Lake volcano, Siskiyou County, California, USA. Sediment cores and high-resolution bathymetric and seismic reflection data were collected from the lake during the fall of 1999 and 2000. Sediments were analyzed for diatoms, pollen, density, grain size (sand/mud ratio), total organic carbon (TOC), and micro-scale fabric analysis. Using both C-14 (AMS) dating and tephrochronology, the basal sediments were estimated to have been deposited about 11,400 cal year BP, thus yielding an estimated average sedimentation rate of about 20.66 cm/1,000 year. The lowermost part of the core (11,400-10,300 cal year BP) contains the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. From about 11,000-5,500 cal year BP, Medicine Lake consisted of two small, steep-sided lakes or one lake with two steep-sided basins connected by a shallow shelf. During this time, both the pollen (Abies/Artemisia ratio) and the diatom (Cyclotella/Navicula ratio) evidences indicate that the effective moisture increased, leading to a deeper lake. Over the past 5,500 years, the pollen record shows that effective moisture continued to increase, and the diatom record indicates fluctuations in the lake level. The change in the lake level pattern from one of the increasing depths prior to about 6,000 cal year BP to one of the variable depths may be related to changes in the morphology of the Medicine Lake caldera associated with the movement of magma and the eruption of the Medicine Lake Glass Flow about 5,120 cal year BP. These changes in basin morphology caused Medicine Lake to flood the shallow shelf which surrounds the deeper part of the lake. During this period, the Cyclotella/Navicula ratio and the percent abundance of Isoetes vary, suggesting that the level of the lake fluctuated, resulting in changes in the shelf area available for colonization by benthic diatoms and Isoetes. These fluctuations are not typical of the small number of low-elevation Holocene lake records in the region, and probably reflect the hydrologic conditions unique to Medicine Lake.

The results are as follows: 1) the ecosystem service value in Circum-Taihu Lake region in recent 20 years has decreased 0.81 billion yuan with yearly decrease of 0.04 billion yuan and the decreasing speed in recent 10 years has slowed down a little. The great decrease in arable land chiefly accounts for the decrease in ecosystem service value; 2) the profits and losses of the ecosystem service value is quite varied in different places, the ecosystem service value in the entire area has been on the decline and that of some local areas has been falling faster and faster; 3) the gravity center of the ecosystem service value in Circum-Taihu Lake region is gradually moving southwestward. The spatial difference of the ecosystem service value in different regions tends to decrease. The decreasing speed in E-W direction is faster than that in S-N direction. The spatial difference changes are chiefly due to the spatial difference changes of arable land and water area; 4) The whole spatial pattern of the ecosystem service value in Circum-Taihu Lake region remains relatively stable; however, it shows the spatial autocorrelation. areas similar in land capita ecosystem service value in Circum-Taihu Lake region tend to cluster, that is, areas with high or low land capita ecosystem service value cluster respectively in space. This trend is becoming stronger with the passage of time. The changes of the spatial pattern of ecosystem service value are mainly driven by the evolution of the spatial pattern of arable land.																					978-1-4244-7302-1				2010																								WOS:000296522300446

M.; Finsinger, Walter; Cagliero, Eleonora; Heiri, Oliver			Holocene ecosystem and temperature development inferred from invertebrate remains in Zminje Jezero (Dinaric Alps, Montenegro)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lake Zminje Jezero (1535 m a.s.l.) in Montenegro was studied for chironomid and other aquatic invertebrate remains in a sediment sequence dating back to 12,000 calibrated 14C years before present (cal yr BP), providing, to our knowledge, the first lake-sediment record studied for chironomids and other associated chitinous aquatic invertebrate remains in the Dinaric Alps. Changes in chironomid and other invertebrate remains along the record make it possible to constrain changes of relevant environmental variables for aquatic invertebrates in the lake including temperature, oxygen availability, trophic status and water depth. The results suggest moderate changes in trophic conditions with chironomid assemblages indicating meso- to eutrophic conditions during the analysed interval. Invertebrate assemblages were typical for lakes with relatively high oxygen availability with a minor trend during the middle to late Holocene to conditions observed in lakes that are more hypoxic. A change in temperature is suggested in the earlier part of the record when the share of chironomid taxa adapted to warmer conditions increased, at the Younger Dryas to Holocene transition, whereas later no particularly pronounced shifts in temperature-sensitive taxa were observed. July air temperatures were estimated based on chironomid assemblages using a transfer function based on calibration data consisting of 117 lakes sampled in the Swiss Alps and northern Switzerland. The results suggest that temperatures rapidly increased by 5 degrees C at the onset of the Holocene (11,500 cal yr BP) leading to a relatively warm early to mid-Holocene and thereafter slightly decreased during the late Holocene. Reconstructed temperatures are discussed together with a previously published pollen record for our study site and are broadly consistent with other chironomid-based temperature reconstructions from Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. From ca. 3000 cal yr BP sedimentation rates increased and from ca. 500 cal yr BP onwards pollen data suggest that the vegetation and lake catchment were affected by human activities, possibly influencing chironomid and other invertebrate assemblages in the lake and thereby also reconstructed temperatures. Overall, our results show that combining analyses of chironomid and other invertebrate assemblages can provide valuable insights into long-term environmental changes and can provide temperature reconstructions for small mountain lakes in the Balkans, such as Zminje Jezero.

The gas is contained in a high-quality dryland sandstone reservoir at approximately 2,900 m below sea level. The Groningen Field was discovered in 1959 by well Slochteren-1 with production starting in 1963. In this paper, the different phases of field development are discussed, illustrating the improved understanding of the subsurface over the past five decades through continued data acquisition like coring and advancements in technology, particularly of 3D seismic. The initial field development phase took some fifteen years, during which 29 well cluster locations were built and a total of over 300 wells were drilled for production and observation purposes. Integration of acquired data from the field together with state-of-the-art static and dynamic modelling technology now allow operating the Groningen system as a smart field, which requires only a few operators to produce up to 255 x 10(6) m(3)/d (9 x 10(9) scf/d) of gas on peak days during winter. Interestingly, the main focus of early exploration drilling was on oil prospects in Zechstein carbonates, and only with well Slochteren-1 did the focus change to gas prospects in the underlying Rotliegend Group. As is well established now, this gas petroleum system of Palaeozoic origin is the most important one in the Netherlands and is responsible for the generation of the Groningen Field gas predominantly during the Jurassic and, less importantly, during the Tertiary. Furthermore, a characterisation of the Rotliegend reservoir is provided. Its complex reservoir architecture is, firstly, a function of the sedimentary facies distribution, ranging from proximal alluvial-fan deposits in the south to playa-lake deposits in the north and, secondly, of the multiphase structural deformation of the Groningen High in the northern Netherlands. Diagenetic impairment of reservoir quality plays only a minor role in the field, which is related to the relatively early gas charge in the field. Gas retention over such a long time is attributed to the perfect top seal formed by the Zechstein evaporites. Fifty years after discovery, the Groningen Gas Field is still the most important gas supplier in Europe, with the end of field life expected in some fifty years from now. A review of this history to date is presented in this paper.						Grotsch, Jurgen/0000-0002-5013-1952													1060-071X		978-1-56576-300-5				2011		98					11	+																WOS:000308513900003
J	Wehner, H; Huchler, K; Fritz, J				Wehner, Helena; Huchler, Katharina; Fritz, Johannes			Quantification of Foraging Areas for the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita) in the Northern Alpine Foothills: A Random Forest Model Fitted with Optical and Actively Sensed Earth Observation Data	REMOTE SENSING												The Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is an endangered migratory species, which went extinct in Europe in the 17th century. Currently, a translocation project in the frame of the European LIFE program is carried out, to reintroduce a migratory population with breeding colonies in the northern and southern Alpine foothills and a common wintering area in southern Tuscany. The population meanwhile consists of about 200 individuals, with about 90% of them carrying a GPS device on their back. We used biologging data from 2021 to model the habitat suitability for the species in the northern Alpine foothills. To set up a species distribution model, indices describing environmental conditions were calculated from satellite images of Landsat-8, and in addition to the well-proven use of optical remote sensing data, we also included Sentinel-1 actively sensed observation data, as well as climate and urbanization data. A random forest model was fitted on NBI GPS positions, which we used to identify regions with high predicted foraging suitability within the northern Alpine foothills. The model resulted in 84.5% overall accuracy. Elevation and slope had the highest predictive power, followed by grass cover and VV intensity of Sentinel-1 radar data. The map resulting from the model predicts the highest foraging suitability for valley floors, especially of Inn, Rhine, and Salzach-Valley as well as flatlands, like the Swiss Plateau and the agricultural areas surrounding Lake Constance. Areas with a high suitability index largely overlap with known historic breeding sites. This is particularly noteworthy because the model only refers to foraging habitats without considering the availability of suitable breeding cliffs. Detailed analyses identify the transition zone from extensive grassland management to intensive arable farming as the northern range limit. The modeling outcome allows for defining suitable areas for further translocation and management measures in the frame of the European NBI reintroduction program. Although required in the international IUCN translocation guidelines, the use of models in the context of translocation projects is still not common and in the case of the Northern Bald Ibis not considered in the present Single Species Action Plan of the African-Eurasian Migratory Water bird Agreement. Our species distribution model represents a contemporary snapshot, but sustainability is essential for conservation planning, especially in times of climate change. In this regard, a further model could be optimized by investigating sustainable land use, temporal dynamics, and climate change scenarios.

J	Rife, DL; Davis, CA; Liu, YB; Warner, TT				Rife, DL; Davis, CA; Liu, YB; Warner, TT			Predictability of low-level winds by mesoscale meteorological models	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This study describes the verification of model-based, low-level wind forecasts for the area of the Salt Lake valley and surrounding mountains during the 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah, Winter Olympics. Standard verification statistics (such as bias and mean absolute error) for wind direction and speed were compared for four models: the Eta, Rapid Update Cycle (RUC-2), and Global Forecast System of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5). Even though these models had horizontal grid increments that ranged over almost two orders of magnitude, the highest-resolution MM5 with a 1.33-km grid increment exhibited a forecast performance similar to that of the other models in terms of grid-average, conventional verification metrics. This is in spite of the fact that the MM5 is the only model capable of reasonably representing the complex terrain of the Salt Lake City region that exerts a strong influence on the local circulation patterns. The purpose of this study is to investigate why the standard verification measures did not better discriminate among the models and to describe alternative measures that might better represent the ability of high-horizontal-resolution models to forecast locally forced mesogamma-scale circulations. The spatial variability of the strength of the diurnal forcing was quantified by spectrally transforming the time series of wind-component data for each observation location. The amount of spectral power in the band with approximately a diurnal period varied greatly from place to place, as did the amount of power in the bands with periods longer (superdiurnal) and shorter (subdiurnal) than the diurnal. It is reasonable that the superdiurnal power is largely in the synoptic-scale motions, and thus can be reasonably predicted by all the models. In contrast, the subdiurnal power is mainly in nondiurnally forced small-scale fluctuations that are generally unpredictable with any horizontal resolution because they are unobserved in three dimensions by the observation network. A strong positive relationship is demonstrated between the strength of the local forcing at each observation location, as measured by the spectral power in the diurnal band of the wind component time series, and forecast skill, as reflected by an alternative verification metric, a measure of anomaly correlation. However, the mean-absolute error showed no relationship to the power in the diurnal band. Two other measures of comparison among the low-level wind forecasts, the direction climatology and the spatial variance, showed a positive correlation between forecast quality and horizontal resolution.					; Davis, Chris/KBA-9010-2024	Davis, Christopher/0000-0003-4530-2726; 													0027-0644					NOV	2004	132	11					2553	2569		10.1175/MWR2801.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR2801.1													WOS:000225098900003

The main sources of pollution are urban and industrialwastewater and agricultural and livestockactivities. Studies have found the water quality and trophic status of the basin to be mesotrophic. The aim of the study is to examine the correlations between various physicochemical parameters, phytoplankton species, biotic indices, and abiotic indices, and to evaluate the ecological status of the lentic systems in the Eastern Mediterranean River basin in Turkey. The results showed that phytoplankton species such as Peridinium cinctum, Ceratium hirundinella, and Gyrosigmabalticum were the most significant contributors to the algal biomass of the lake systems in the basin.The findings indicated that the water quality of the lakes was better in the spring season, and Akgol Lake was found to be the shallow lake with the lowest ecological status among the lakes in the Eastern Mediterranean River basin. The results of the biotic and abiotic indices mostly indicated that the distal areas of the lakes, L1, L3, L4, L5, L6, and L7, had high ecological status.The results showed that the main ecological factors affecting the dominant phytoplankton species were conductivity and ammonium levels. The relationship between the biotic and abiotic indices was strong, with diatom-based TDIL and the physicochemical-based WQI appearing to be the most suitable for assessing the ecological status of lentic systems in the region. The study concluded that combining both biotic and abiotic indices provides a more accuratedetermination of water quality in lentic systems. The objective of this research was to assess the ecological status of lentic systems in the Eastern Mediterranean River basin (Turkiye) using some biotic (Q index, PT-BV, MedPTI, TDIL, and PTI) and abiotic (WQI, WQImin-nw, TSI, TLI, and Kna) indices. Phytoplankton species such as Peridinium cinctum, Ceratium hirundinella, and Gyrosigma balticum were the species that contributed the most to the algal biovolume of lake systems with different ecological statuses in the basin. According to the results, it was seen that CCA coordination, which analyzed the relationship structures between dominant phytoplankton taxa and environmental water quality parameters, explained the variation sufficiently. As pointed out in the CCA analysis, conductivity and ammonium were the main environmental parameters influencing algal assemblages at sampling sites in the basin (p < 0.01). Strong correlations were observed between TSI and TLI (correlation coefficient: 0.99), and TDIL showed significant correlation only with the Q index (p < 0.01). TSI, TLI and WQI, abiotic indices, indicated significant correlations with most environmental parameters (p < 0.01), while PTI, a biotic index, had weak correlations with most environmental parameters (p > 0.05). Among the indices used in this study, it seems that diatom-based TDIL and physicochemical-based WQI appear to be the most suitable indices for assessing the ecological status of lentic systems in the Mediterranean region. Accordingly, it can be deduced that coupling biotic and abiotic indices is more accurate in determining the water quality of lentic systems.

The forecasting system operated on two separate domains centered on Chicago, IL, and New York City, NY, and provided 72-hour predictions of atmospheric composition, aerosols, and clouds. This study evaluates the Chicago-centered forecasting system's 1-, 2-, and 3-day ozone (O3) forecast skill for Chiwaukee Prairie, WI, a rural area downwind of Chicago that often experiences high levels of O3 pollution. Comparisons to vertical O3 profiles collected by a Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) instrument revealed that forecast skill decreases as forecast lead time increases. When compared to surface measurements, the forecasting system tended to underestimate O3 concentrations on high O3 days and overestimate on low O3 days at Chiwaukee Prairie regardless of forecast lead time. Using July 25, 2023, as a case study, analyses show that the forecasts underestimated peak O3 levels at Chiwaukee Prairie during this regionwide bad air quality day. Wind speed and direction data indicates that this underestimation can partially be attributed to lake breeze simulation errors. Surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measurements, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and back trajectories from the NOAA Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model show that transported Canadian wildfire smoke impacted the Lake Michigan region on this day. Errors in the forecasted chemical composition and transport of the smoke plumes also contributed to underpredictions of O3 levels at Chiwaukee Prairie on July 25, 2023. The results of this work help identify improvements that can be made for future iterations of the WRF-Chem forecasting system.Implications: Air quality forecasting is an important tool that can be used to inform the public about upcoming high pollution days so that individuals may plan accordingly to limit their exposure to health-damaging air pollutants. Forecasting also helps scientists make decisions about where to make observations during air quality field campaigns. A variety of observational datasets were used to evaluate the accuracy of an air quality forecasting system that was developed for NOAA and NASA field campaigns that occurred in the summer of 2023. These evaluations inform areas of improvement for future development of this air quality forecasting system.

In this paper, we decompose the grain size frequency distributions (GSFD) for 196 lake surface sediments from 61 lakes and 9 reservoirs across the Inner Mongolia Plateau and adjacent areas and divide them into five GSFD components. We statistically analyze the relationship between the GSFD components and influencing variables to determine the taphonomic dynamics and their environmental implications. Within individual lakes, we found that GSFD component 4 (74.00-209.30 mu m) and GSFD component 5 (209.30-592.00 mu m) dominate near the lake margin and reduce toward the lake center in proportions. By contrast, GSFD component 2 (2.75-15.56 mu m) increases toward the lake center. Therefore, the proportions of GSFD component 2, 4, and 5 reflect the relative distance to the lakeshore and allow inferences about lake area changes. We apply this large modern dataset to a sediment core obtained from Lake Wulanhushao (WLHS) on the Inner Mongolia Plateau and link the lake surface sediment-based GSFD components to BEMMA end-members of grain size records to define their environmental implications over the last 18.59 cal. kyrs BP. We found that the Lake WLHS has responded to the orbital and suborbital climate changes since the last deglaciation. Specifically, maximum lake transgression prevailed during the early to middle Holocene (11.70-7.10 cal. kyr BP), medium lake transgression dominated during 17.05-15.80 cal. kyr BP, and weak transgression developed during 14.60-12.90 cal. kyr BP. Maximum lake regressions prevailed before 17.05 cal. kyr BP, during 15.80-14.60 cal. kyr BP and 12.90-11.70 cal. kyr BP. Our reconstructed early Holocene maximum lake area is consistent with regional abiotic proxy-based moisture records, but contrasts with the regional biotic proxy-based moisture records, which reconstruct increasing moisture conditions. Our new method to determine lake area changes will provide valuable data to understand the climate dynamics of northern China.

Over the last 20 years there have been efforts in many countries to halt the process of eutrophication, and to restore lakes to some "ideal" state. There have been three phases in this process: Reduction or removal of point source discharges of nutrients; Reduction of diffuse source discharges of nutrients; Physical or biological manipulation of lakes. There have been attempts to combine the knowledge from these individual cases to produce general predictive models of the process of lake restoration following nutrient reduction. There are three major factors that tend to reduce the applicability of general predictive models of lake restoration, and they clearly operate at local scales. These are: (1) the local geological context, which among other things determines the limiting nutrient (eg nitrogen vs phosphorus) and the extent to which groundwater affects nutrient inputs to lakes from the catchment, (2) the effect of climate (which influences the stratification and the extent of internal loading), and (3) regional or local biogeography. Examples are provided for lakes that do not conform to traditional Northern Hemisphere eutrophication models and where restoration needs to be specific to local conditions. These are lakes of the volcanic areas that are nitrogen limited due to local P-rich soils, and lakes of some south temperate latitudes that have the peak phytoplankton biomass in winter due to local or regional climatic conditions influencing the stratification cycle. The importance of local biogeography and biodiversity is a key factor on restoration processes. Some areas simply have no herbivorous fish for instance, and in other areas invasive species have so modified lake systems that the goals of restoration are inherently compromised. We argue that local perspectives are likely to override conclusions derived from global models of the lake restoration process. As a consequence, a recommended approach is to use some type of expert system tool applied to lakes on a case-by-case basis. We also recognise that linking lakes with the people of the lake catchment is central to any programme. It is local communities who decide on the goals of the restoration taking into account affordability and local cultural ideals.																					4-431-00488-2				2003							153	175																WOS:000182379700010

Climatic interpretation of a 1.9 Ma environmental magnetic record of loess deposition and soil formation in the central eastern Pampas of Buenos Aires, Argentina	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Much of what we know about Quaternary climate has been learned from sedimentary records from the world's oceans. With the exception of the extensive studies of the Chinese loess/paleosol sequence and more recent studies of long lake records, there are few long terrestrial climate records, particularly from the southern hemisphere. The loess record of Argentina provides an important opportunity to further our understanding of climate change from a terrestrial environment, but its complexity and discontinuity have led to difficulty in formulating a climatological model of depositional and pedogenic processes. In this study, we present one of the longest and most continuous loess/loessoid records from the central eastern Pampas of Argentina. Our age model is based on optically stimulated luminescent dates and a paleomagnetic reversal stratigraphy and indicates a basal age around 1.9 Ma. Within the age model uncertainties, we characterize the environmental magnetic properties associated with loess deposition and soil formation with respect to wind patterns, moisture availability, and temperature. Major changes in magnetic grain size are linked to a differential northward shift of the subtropical high-pressure cell during glacial periods. We suggest that coarser (finer) magnetic grains correspond to weaker (stronger) glacial periods when the high-pressure cell is located in a more southerly (northerly) position and the source region is more proximal (distal) to our study area. An abrupt increase in the ultrafine-grained magnetic material around 0.9 Ma is related to an increase in moisture transport from the South Atlantic driven by an increase in summer sea surface temperatures at the mid-Pleistocene transition (similar to 1 Ma). In addition to these grain size variations, there is a relative decrease in the amount of goethite compared to hematite beginning around 0.5 Ma, which has been related to the temperature increase observed after the mid-Brunhes Event (similar to 450 ka) in the EPICA ice core temperature record. A more detailed comparison to insolation indicates that, for portions of the record, ferrimagnetic minerals are depleted during periods of low insolation. This result suggests that Argentine loess deposition and soil formation follows a model more similar to the Alaskan loess sequences than the Chinese loess sequences. Although further work is needed to validate the models and mechanisms proposed in this study, our record indicates that the mineral magnetic properties of the loess and paleosol deposits record major changes in deposition and soil formation and provide insight into possible mechanisms relating to global and/or hemispheric climate change.

Knowledge of the history of long-term P dynamics is essential for understanding present-day landscape P export and for managing both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This study is the first attempt to constrain the timing and magnitude of terrestrial changes in Holocene P dynamics across the Northern Hemisphere using lake sediment records. Here we reconstruct trajectories in terrestrial Holocene P dynamics for the Northern Hemisphere. We apply a simple process model to published lake sediment geochemical P records from 24 sites, producing records of landscape P yield and reconstructing lake water total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Individual site trajectories of landscape P yield and lake water TP vary systematically, with differences attributable to local landscape development history. Three distinct traits are apparent. Mountain sites with minimal direct human impact show falling P supply and conform to conceptual models of natural soil development (Trait 1). Lowland sites where substantial (pre-)historic agriculture was present show progressively increasing P supply (Trait 2). Lowland sites may also show a rapid acceleration in P supply over the last few centuries, where high-intensity land use, including settlements and farming, is present (Trait 3). Where data availability permitted comparison, our reconstructed TP records agree well with monitored lake water TP data, and our sediment-inferred P yields are comparable to reported catchment export coefficients. Comparison with diatom-inferred TP reveals good agreement for recent records. Our reconstructions form the first systematic assessment of average terrestrial P export for the Northern Hemisphere over the Holocene and provide the empirical data needed for constraining long-term landscape P cycling models and values for terrestrial P export that could be used for ocean P cycling models. The long-term perspective provided by our sediment-inferred TP can be used to identify pre-disturbance baselines for lake water quality, information essential to target-driven lake management. We find the first detectable anthropogenic impacts on P cycling ca. 6000 BP, with more substantial impacts as early as 3000 BP. Consequently, to characterize pre-disturbance lake P conditions at Trait 2 and Trait 3 sites, it is necessary to consider time periods before the arrival of early farmers. Our use of trait classifications has a predictive power for sites without sediment records, allowing prediction of TP baselines and P trajectories based on regional landscape development history.					; Chiverrell, Richard/A-9115-2011	Chiverrell, Richard/0000-0002-7307-2756; Moyle, Madeleine/0000-0002-7661-598X; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 20	2021	18	20					5609	5638		10.5194/bg-18-5609-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5609-2021													WOS:000710515000001

Harvesting with advance regeneration protection (HARP) is one such technique practised in the Lake Abitibi Model Forest of northeastern Ontario on peatland sites. In this system, winter harvesting operations clear trees in strips about 5-7 m wide and using a minimum diameter limit cut extract trees from the adjacent residual forest rows, 5-9 m wide. In order to assess the effectiveness of HARP in retaining forest structure, we quantified forest and understorey structural features in 24 1.65-ha plots spanning a wide range of forest retention, including clearcuts, three levels of HARP, and the edge and interior of unharvested forest (logging had occurred 2.5-3.5 years before the study). Mean tree age, diameter, and height in HARP forests in all cases exceeded 68% of the mean values found in unharvested forest, which was strikingly higher than the percent retention of basal area (20-43%). Also, unlike clearcuts, HARP forests retained the inverse-J curves between stem density and size class observed in unharvested forests, although stem densities in all size classes were lower. The percentage of black spruce regeneration originating from seed versus vegetative layering was directly related to the amount of forest basal area retained, averaging 2-5% in unharvested forests, 9-38% in HARP forests, and 67% in clearcuts. Many understorey characteristics closely followed the harvest intensity gradient, with amounts of moss, lichen, and Ledum highest at the unharvested end of the gradient and amounts of decaying moss, coarse and fine downed woody debris, exposed soil, and sedge highest at the clearcut end of the gradient. When the structural features were combined into a single composite variable using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and the scores plotted against basal area, the relationship was curvilinear, with HARP treatments retaining greater amounts of structural characteristics than expected based solely on the basal area of wood harvested. This research suggests that the retention and redevelopment of old-growth features in peatland black spruce forests will be better under a HARP system than under a traditional clearcut system. Longer-term research, specifically on the edge habitats created by the HARP system, is required.																			0015-7546					MAY-JUN	2003	79	3					579	589		10.5558/tfc79579-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc79579-3													WOS:000184445600043

Simultaneously, effects of oxygen deficiency on glycogen utilization and survival were experimentally studied. The population consisted of almost fullgrown 4th instar larvae in 1992 and 2nd and 3rd instar larvae in 1993. Growth rate and glycogen content changed as hypolimnetic oxygen deficiency increased. During a 1st phase of stratification dry weight and glycogen content increased (2nd and 3rd instars) or was almost constant (4th instar) but decreased significantly during the following 2nd phase. This change from growth to degrowth and utilization of endogenous glycogen reserves correlated with a change in the thickness of the microxic layer (<0.2 mg O-2 l(-1)) above the sediment surface. The layer increased from 2-3 m in phase 1 to 4-5 m in phase 2, and we suggest that this deteriorated the oxygen conditions and resulted in a change in larval energy metabolism from fully aerobic during the 1st phase to partly anaerobic in the 2nd phase. During the 2nd phase larval metabolism was estimated at less than 20% of normoxic rate. Experimental exposure of the larvae to anoxia indicated highly different survival of young larvae (2nd and 3rd instars) and older larvae (large 4th instars). The mortality of young larvae was 50% after three days in anoxia at 10 degrees C, whereas only 25% of the older larvae had died after 3-4 weeks under similar conditions. Extending the treatment, however, resulted in increased death rate of the 4th instar larvae with only 10% surviving after seven weeks. The anaerobic metabolism of 4th instar larvae as estimated from glycogen degradation at 10 degrees C was 5% of normoxia in the interval from 0-5 days but 1.5% in the interval from 20-25 days. It is concluded that survival of C. anthracinus in anoxia is very limited, but traces of oxygen in the environment allowing for faint aerobic metabolism prolong the survival time of the larvae from a few days (2nd and 3rd instars) or a few weeks (4th instar) to probably 3-4 months.																			0018-8158					FEB 17	1995	297	3					187	200		10.1007/BF00019284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019284													WOS:A1995QJ79500002

Transepithelial potential in the Magadi tilapia, a fish living in extreme alkalinity	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												We investigated the transepithelial potential (TEP) and its responses to changes in the external medium in Alcolapia grahami, a small cichlid fish living in Lake Magadi, Kenya. Magadi water is extremely alkaline (pH = 9.92) and otherwise unusual: titratable alkalinity (290 mequiv L-1, i.e. HCO3 (-) and CO3 (2-)) rather than Cl- (112 mmol L-1) represents the major anion matching Na+ = 356 mmol L-1, with very low concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (< 1 mmol L-1). Immediately after fish capture, TEP was +4 mV (inside positive), but stabilized at +7 mV at 10-30 h post-capture when experiments were performed in Magadi water. Transfer to 250% Magadi water increased the TEP to +9.5 mV, and transfer to fresh water and deionized water decreased the TEP to -13 and -28 mV, respectively, effects which were not due to changes in pH or osmolality. The very negative TEP in deionized water was attenuated in a linear fashion by log elevations in [Ca2+]. Extreme cold (1 vs. 28A degrees C) reduced the positive TEP in Magadi water by 60%, suggesting blockade of an electrogenic component, but did not alter the negative TEP in dilute solution. When fish were transferred to 350 mmol L-1 solutions of NaHCO3, NaCl, NaNO3, or choline Cl, only the 350 mmol L-1 NaHCO3 solution sustained the TEP unchanged at +7 mV; in all others, the TEP fell. Furthermore, after transfer to 50, 10, and 2% dilutions of 350 mmol L-1 NaHCO3, the TEPs remained identical to those in comparable dilutions of Magadi water, whereas this did not occur with comparable dilutions of 350 mmol L-1 NaCl-i.e. the fish behaves electrically as if living in an NaHCO3 solution equimolar to Magadi water. We conclude that the TEP is largely a Na+ diffusion potential attenuated by some permeability to anions. In Magadi water, the net electrochemical forces driving Na+ inwards (+9.9 mV) and Cl- outwards (+3.4 mV) are small relative to the strong gradient driving HCO3 (-) inwards (-82.7 mV). Estimated permeability ratios are P (Cl)/P (Na) = 0.51-0.68 and P-HCO3/P-Na = 0.10-0.33. The low permeability to HCO3 (-) is unusual, and reflects a unique adaptation to life in extreme alkalinity. Cl- is distributed close to Nernst equilibrium in Magadi water, so there is no need for lower P (Cl). The higher P (Na) likely facilitates Na+ efflux through the paracellular pathway. The positive electrogenic component is probably due to active HCO3 (-) excretion.					; Wood, Chris/C-3021-2009; Bianchini, Adalto/C-5384-2013; Babak, Michael/AAJ-1448-2021	Babak Papah, Michael/0000-0003-0306-7510; Bianchini, Adalto/0000-0002-7627-7650; Wood, Chris/0000-0002-9542-2219; 													0174-1578	1432-136X				FEB	2012	182	2					247	258		10.1007/s00360-011-0614-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-011-0614-y								21912898					WOS:000299332400007

Tree Regeneration Structure Following Beech Bark Disease-Motivated Harvests: Factors Associated with Patterns and Management Implications	FORESTS												In the northern Appalachian region of North America, mortality of mature American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) via the introduced beech bark disease (BBD) can result in dense thickets of beech saplings that inhibit the regeneration of other species. It is unknown if similar structures characterize more recently infested managed forests in the Great Lakes region. If these dense beech sapling layers do exist, management would be aided by knowing which site/regional factors they are associated with and by identifying particular sapling structures that may threaten the sustainability of these forests under current management paradigms. To examine these patterns, we used a natural experiment with sample plots in 69 unevenly aged, selection silviculture-managed, maple (Acer spp.)-dominated northern hardwood stands. Our stands were dispersed across northern Michigan, USA and had undergone BBD-motivated partial harvests favoring beech removal (mean = 5.5 years before measurement). In each stand, we quantified tree regeneration structure in relation to winter deer use (fecal pellet count density), site quality (habitat type), geographic region (Eastern Upper Peninsula and Northern Lower Peninsula), and multiple measures of overstory stand density. We also examined the density effects of taller regeneration strata on subordinate strata. Across sites, the small sapling recruit class (i.e., >137 cm tall and <5 cm diameter at 137 cm tall) was dominated by beech and was often dense (44% of subplots > 2000 stems ha(-1) and 16% of subplots > 5000 ha(-1)) but never exceeded the > 10,000 stems ha(-1) reported in the northern Appalachian region. Beech sapling density was higher in the Northern Lower Peninsula, on lower quality sites, at lower postharvest overstory densities, and on sites with higher densities of preharvest overstory beech. In contrast to the beech-dominated small sapling recruit class, seedlings (i.e., <25 cm tall) were generally more species diverse than sapling strata and were dominated by maple species. Although generally dense, seedling density was negatively related to small sapling recruit density, suggesting that saplings may suppress the seedling stratum. The general pattern for the small sapling recruit layer of browsing-insensitive beech (and ironwood, Ostrya virginiana Mill. K. Koch) dominance and low representation of browsing-sensitive species (e.g., Acer spp.) circumstantially supports the notion that regeneration structure is heavily influenced by deer. However, current deer use was generally low in our stands, and relationships with tree regeneration structure were weak. Instead, regeneration structure is likely shaped by a combination of factors operating at long time scales (i.e., legacies of deer browsing pressure, selection silviculture (given beech and ironwood are shade tolerant), overstory composition, and site quality) and by those effects that are more proximal, such as postharvest overstory density. Minimum stocking criteria for species considered desirable for management (e.g., sugar maple and Acer saccharum Marshall) suggest many stands are inadequately stocked in the sapling recruit classes. Although future regeneration dynamics are unclear, current patterns suggest that many stands with high beech/ironwood small sapling recruit densities may require management intervention to overcome insufficient recruitment of species targeted for management.																				1999-4907				FEB	2020	11	2							180	10.3390/f11020180	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11020180													WOS:000519236600005

Soil signifies a composite ecosystem that includes a variety of microorganisms including bacteria. In this study, the bacterial diversity of soil samples from different sites of Ajodhya hill was estimated. Materials and methods: Study sites include Ajodhya hilltop, Marble lake, Upper dam, Loharia lake, Thurga falls, and Vertical hill of Ajodhya. Soil samples from these regions were collected and different groups of bacterial populations were enumerated by colony forming unit (cfu). Physico-chemical parameters of soil samples were analysed. Results and discussion: The population of aerobic heterotopic, starch hydrolyzing, phosphate solubilizing, lipid solubilizing, nitrate reducing, spore forming, Gram-negative, and nitrifying bacteria varied from 9.43 to 12.55 x 10(6), 2.88 to 6.11 x 10(3), 6.07 to 9.23 x 10(3), 2.21 to 5.91 x 10(2),3.23 to 9.7 x 10(3), 6.81 to 12.30 x 10(5), 2.22 to 8.6 x 10(3), 2.7 to 8.63 x 10(3) cfu/g of dry soil respectively.The organic carbon content ranged from 0.39% to 0.68% in the soil sample collected. The available nitrogen, potassium, phosphate, and pH levels in the soil sample ranged from 42.55 to 144.68 mg/kg, 1661.61 to 3749.28 mg/kg, 153.37 to 349.36 mg/kg, and 5.4 to 8. Results of one-way ANOVA indicated significant variation (p < 0.05) in the bacterial population of the soil sample among the various sites. Hierarchical clustering analysis between the various bacterial groups present in the soil helped with unraveling the similitudes connecting them. The Renyi diversity index helped with understanding the diversity, richness, and evenness of the microbial population of the soil samples. Conclusion: The outcomes reveal the highest bacterial diversity in Vertical hill and the least diversity in Ajodhya hilltop. The highest value for the Berger-Parker index found on the Ajodhya hilltop shows that the dominant species represent the larger part of the entire bacterial population of the hill. This variation in the diversity of soil bacteria is due to different microhabitats present in that area from where soil samples were collected.					; MONDAL, AYAN/HNB-6056-2023; Bag, Souvik/MBV-0283-2025	Bag, Souvik/0009-0008-9663-8389; 													1872-2032					OCT	2023	43	5					899	906		10.1016/j.chnaes.2023.01.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2023.01.004		AUG 2023											WOS:001103090500001

Reconstructed values at the sites around 36.6 degrees N and 700 m altitude are as follows. In marine isotope stage (MIS) 6, the average annual mean temperature was about 2.1 degrees C, with a coldest month temperature of -11.8 degrees C, which suggest very cold climate conditions. The climates of MIS 4 and 2 were similarly cold, and the precipitation was low with similar to 1050 mm for mean annual precipitations during these cold periods. In contrast, the annual mean temperatures of MIS 5e and MIS 1, among the warmest periods, averaged about 5.5 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C, respectively. The annual mean temperature of MIS 5e was significantly lower than that of the Holocene. We estimate that an intensely cold winter controlled the vegetation, which resulted in the lower temperature reconstruction for MIS 5e. The annual mean temperatures of intermediately warm periods such as MIS 5c and 5a were a slightly high, with averages of 4.4 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C, respectively. Annual precipitations increased up to similar to 1400 mm on average in these warmer periods. Annual mean temperatures of MIS 5d and 5b were low with averages of about 3.0 degrees C. Annual mean temperatures reconstructed for MIS 3 fluctuated over short periodicities that correspond to DansgaardeOeschger cycles. For example, the annual mean temperature of the interstadial GI-8 (Greenland Interstadial 8), 38-39 cal ka BP (calendar ka before 1950 CE) was about 4.0 degrees C, and that of the stadial HE 4 (Heinrich event 4) in 42-43 cal ka BP was about 2.6 degrees C. From 14 to 12 cal ka BP, annual mean temperature increased significantly in a relatively short period, from 1.3 to 9.5 degrees C, and annual precipitation also increased from 1040 to 1380 mm. A cool event corresponding to the Younger Dryas was identified in this deglaciation process, but its intensity was much weaker than that in the North Atlantic region. The climate in the Holocene (MIS 1) was warm, with an average annual mean temperature of 9.0 degrees C with wide variation, by a maximum of about 2 degrees C, which suggests temporal change of the Arctic polar front situated in mid-latitude regions.

Paleogeography of the Atelian regression in the Caspian Sea (based on drilling data)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Caspian Sea is the world's largest lake noted for a unique history of its evolution in the past. One of most important events in the Caspian history is the Atelian regression. The purpose of this work is to specify the extent, the time, and environments of the Atelian regression, as well as its correlation with events in the adjacent regions, on the basis of multidisciplinary studies of the Atelian deposits penetrated by engineering boreholes in the Northern Caspian. Processing of two-frequency seismoacoustic profiles permitted to stratify the sequence and to perform a spatial correlation between the determined boundaries of the sedimentary series. The laboratory studies included lithological and geotechnical analysis of the cores, floristic and faunal studies of the organic remains extracted from the cores, as well as analyses of pollen and spores, the isotope and radiocarbon (14C) analysis. In the seismic-acoustic profiles Atelian regression is represented by erosional landforms (incisions) under the reflecting horizon at the base of Khvalynian sediments. The regressive series is noted for inhomogeneous lithology. In depressions they are represented by interlayered clays and clay loams. The elevations between the depressions are composed of loamy sands in association with loams. Plant detritus occur as separate inclusions, or forms layered concentrations; there are also shells of freshwater and terrestrial mollusks. The paleontological material suggests aquatic or wetland environments with freshwater or freshened brackish-water shallow water bodies. The palynological materials provide evidence of diversified landscapes in the northern Caspian Lowland at the time of the Atelian regression - from forests dominated by conifers to periglacial foreststeppe and tundra-forest-steppe, mostly resulting from the climate fluctuations. The redeposited pollen is present in abundance, often well-preserved, indicative of highly active erosion at the time of regression. The Atelian regression maximum and the erosional processes on the northern Caspian Lowland correspond to the maximum cooling of the Kalinin (MIS 4) glacial time. The final stages of the regression fell on the initial phases of the MIS 3 interstadial. As follows from materials obtained by seismic-acoustic profiling and drilling, the Caspian level dropped to -100 m. We attribute the sea level lowering to the Caspian (Hyrcanian) water discharge through the Manych into the Pontian basin and to the specific glacial environment during the Valday (MIS 4) time. The Atelian regression maximum is correlatable with the maximum of the post-Karangatian regression of the Black Sea. It was at the same time that the lacustrine Burtass (Gudilo) series were deposited in the Manych depression. In the stratigraphic scheme of the Caspian Sea the Atelian regressive horizon (as a stratigraphic unit) is positioned between Hyrcanian and the base of Lower Khvalynian deposits. In the Northern Caspian the continental Atelian formation spans a greater chronological interval and should be considered as a suite (or formation) in the regional stratigraphic scheme. A comparison between the position of Atelian deposits in the Pleistocene sequence within the sea basin and on the dry land supports the assumption that the geological records exposed in the coastal zone are incomplete. Only a thorough analysis of the materials obtained from the offshore drilling and from the sequences studied in exposures on land can give a comprehensive picture of the history of regional environments and present them correctly in a stratigraphic scheme.

We systematically investigated fluvial-aeolian deposits in the Middle Jurassic Toutunhe Formation, Upper Jurassic Kalazha Formation, and Lower Cretaceous Tugulu Group in the Junggar Basin to the north of the Tianshan Orogenic Belt via unmanned aerial vehicle-based photogrammetry, scanning electron microscope, grain-size analysis, and detrital zircon geochronology. Paludal and deltaic environments transitioned to a fluvial-aeolian environment from the late Middle Jurassic to the Late Jurassic. Fan delta and incisive braided river deposits accumulated in the earliest Cretaceous and evolved into a lacustrine environment with aeolian deposits in the lakeshore. Aeolian deposits are characterized by moderate- to well-sorted and subangular to subround sandstones with large-scale, high-dip cross-bedding, inversely graded lamination, dominant saltation grains, crescent-shaped, and dish-shaped impact structures. Aeolian deposits contain heavy minerals including more ilmenite, zircon, garnet, and, tourmaline and less magnetite and epidote than the fluvial deposits. The preserved aeolian sediments of the Kalazha Formation extend west-east for more than 100 km, suggesting a wide desert area during the latest Jurassic. The detrital zircon age patterns indicate that the provenance of the aeolian deposits was similar to that of coeval fluvial deposits. The cooccurrence of fluvial and aeolian deposits and the similar provenances but orthogonal flow directions indicate that the aeolian deposits were mainly sourced from the nearby fluvial material within the basin. The evolution of the fluvial-aeolian system responded to a complete base-level cycle controlled by the aridification and tectonics. Due to decreased sediment supply caused by aridification, the base level rose, leading to the change from braided rivers to meandering rivers, along with the deposition of aeolian sediments. Due to the tectonic reactivation in the Late Jurassic, the base level fell, causing the occurrence of alluvial fans and the expansion of the aeolian sediments. Previous studies revealed that the Tianshan in the Jurassic exhibited low relief. The fluvial-aeolian system played an important role in maintaining the limited relief in southern Central Asia. The aeolian sediments were sourced from fluvial sediments with a short transport distance. Controlled by the arid climate, aeolian transport capacity, and the size of aeolian deposits, the evolution of the fluvial-aeolian system responded to a complete base-level cycle controlled by tectonics and palaeoclimate.image					; Xu, Yan/JYP-6729-2024	Guan, Xutong/0000-0003-4858-2292; Jolivet, Marc/0000-0002-1160-9386; Xu, Yan/0000-0001-6656-6718; Wu, Chaodong/0000-0002-5503-8853													0950-091X	1365-2117				MAY	2024	36	3							e12879	10.1111/bre.12879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bre.12879													WOS:001248466300001

In 1989 it was awarded the "European Diploma" because of its international importance. Therefore some measures have been planned to regenerate the affected parts (e.g. by raising the groundwater table) and protect the undisturbed areas. The effects of the measures should be controlled by monitoring vegetation development. Because of the sensitivity of the bog vegetation it is aimed to realize monitoring by means of remote sensing. In 1994 three flights with aerial survey cameras were carried out in order to receive large scaled (1:2.000, 1:1.000, 1:500) images in colour-infrared (CIR) and true colour technique. The vegetation cover in the training areas was sampled simultaneously to the air photo night. The sampling methods differed from Blaun.Branquet approach to sampling of vegetation structure at different scales. The sampling data were compared to the structures and colours in the air photos and thus helped designing an interpretation key. It can be shown, that many important plant species (especially indicator species) and plant communities can be identified in large stale air photos. The best date for laking the photos proved to be late spring (begin of lune). At this phenological state many species did not grow yet, whilst other species (particularly members of the grass familiy) are green, so that they can be distinguished easily. The search for uncommon means of remote sensing such as helicopter models or airship was not successfull, because ail of them have important disadvantages e.g. high costs. As a result it turned out, that the large amount of data collected by means of air photos, which are hardly to be handled, will produce great problems. Therefore it seems useful to get as much data as possible stored, processed, handled and interpreted automatically i.e. by geographic information systems. Consequently we are intending to test airborne scanner data, which are primarily digital data and can be interpreted in a GIS more easily than air photos.																					3-437-25058-2				1996							43	48																WOS:000075264500007
J	Dai, SB; Yang, SL; Zhu, J; Gao, A; Li, P				Dai, SB; Yang, SL; Zhu, J; Gao, A; Li, P			The role of Lake Dongting in regulating the sediment budget of the Yangtze River	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lake Dongting, the second largest freshwater lake in China and located in the middle reaches of the River Yangtze catchment, was formed at the beginning of the Holocene period by sea level rise and has varied in size with changes in local weather patterns. The sedimentation rate in Lake Dongting during the Holocene is about 50 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1), or 80 x 10(6) t yr(-1) (a sand bulk density of 1.6 x 10(3) kg m(-3)), given the sediment deposition rate as 10 mm yr(-1) and the average lake size as 5000 km(2). By comparing the sediment import and export, it is estimated that the sediment deposition rate of Lake Dongting was 110.6 x 10(6) t yr(-1) from 1956 to 2003. Siltation and raised embankments reduced the size of the lake and its capacity to accommodate floods. The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) of the middle and lower Yangtze is about 0.92 (total sediment output divided by total sediment input) given that the total sediment supply into the middle and lower Yangtze is 455.1 x 10(6) t yr(-1) and the total sediment discharge into the sea is 419 x 10(6) t yr(-1). Therefore, if it were not for Lake Dongting, the sediment flux at Datong would be 73.6 x 10(6) t yr(-1) (80 x 10(6) t yr(-1) x 0.92) more, an increase of 27% during the Holocene and an increase of 26% to 101.75 x 10(6) t yr(-1) from 1956 to 2003. Historically, Lake Dongting had a considerable influence in regulating the sediment budget of the Yangtze. However, afforestation and the construction of large dams, such as the Three Gorges Dam, reduced significantly the sediment deposition in Lake Dongting. In 2003, the completion of the Three Gorges Dam and the subsequent impoundment of water reduced the sediment input from the Yangtze and net deposition in Lake Dongting dropped to 25% and 18% of the mean values of the historic records (1956-2003). During the same period, the amount of sediment deposited in Lake Dongting was only 10% of the sediment discharge at Datong. The influence of the sediment deposited in Lake Dongting on the sediment flux to the sea from the Yangtze has fallen since the completion of the Three Gorges Dam and will be further reduced in future. The evolution of the relationship between Lake Dongting and the Yangtze is a compound result of human impacts coupled with natural self-adjusting processes in the river system.

J	Gasperini, L				Gasperini, Luca			Lake Cheko and the 1908 Tunguska Event	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												The so-called Tunguska Event (TE), of June 30 1908, is one of those phenomena that have generated a great and durable interest into generations of earth and planetary scientists and a worldwide audience. This is due to several causes, including the remoteness of the site where it occurred and the global scale of its effects. Thousands of kilometers from the epicentre, over Russia and the Northern Europe, the TE was perceived as a series of unusual phenomena, such as seismic and pressure waves and a bright luminescence in the night skies. Only several years later, in 1927, Leonid Kulik reached the explosion site, a remote region of Central Siberia close to the river Podkamennaya Tunguska, which gave later the name to the event. Kulik identified the epicentre of the explosion in a heavily forested area from the radial distribution of flattened trees. He also found many trees that were left standing directly below the explosion, although deprived of their branches and partially burned. Kulik reached the conclusion that he had discovered the remains of a large impact crater hidden by a swamp and a number of secondary bowl-shaped holes of different sizes covered by peat bogs. This pattern could have been caused by an asteroid that fell in a swarm of separate fragments. Other authors questioned this interpretation, suggesting that the observed circular features were not necessarily related to extraterrestrial impacts, but probably to seasonal thawing and freezing of the ground. Two observations favoured this second interpretation: circular features of similar size are common at these latitude; these depressions were found in low-lying areas, but not on the slopes of the hills, or on any of the reliefs occupying a considerable part of the epicentre region. Moreover, all attempts at finding macro-remnants of the cosmic body by digging these circular depressions were unsuccessful; therefore, the hypothesis of an impact with the ground was abandoned. Subsequent expeditions have been devoted mainly to the study of the tree patterns in the devastated taiga and to the search for micro particles of the cosmic body, under the assumption that it exploded in the atmosphere. After more than a century, the TE is far from being completely understood, although it has been the object of several studies. The most probable hypothesis is that it was caused by the impact with the Earth of a cosmic body, a comet or an asteroid, which exploded about 5-10 km above the ground, releasing in the atmosphere 10-15 Mtons of energy. However, fragments of the impacting Tunguska Cosmic Body (TCB) have never been found, and its nature is still a matter of debate. Geophysical and geological data collected from a small lake about 8 km NNW of the inferred TE epicentre suggest that it is probably a crater left by the impact of a large TCB fragment. Evidence supporting this interpretation includes its funnel-like bottom morphology, revealed by high-resolution bathymetry, and the structure and composition of sedimentary deposits below the lake floor, studied through acoustic imagery and direct sampling. Seismic reflection profiles collected from the lake show a density/P-wave velocity anomaly located about 10 m below its bottom, probably the effect of a buried object, which could have created the lake's depression, or a density anomaly caused by overpressure due to the impact. A magnetic anomaly also marks the presence of such feature. If Lake Cheko, as much evidence seems to suggest, was formed as a consequence of an extraterrestrial impact, it opens the problem of recognizing impact-related features on a composite target such as the Earth surface, very different from the Moon and the other terrestrial planets of the Solar System, where the morphology of "typical" impact features has been mostly studied.					; Gasperini, Luca/B-8796-2017	Gasperini, Luca/0000-0002-0276-0607; 													2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2015	26	2					97	108		10.1007/s12210-015-0403-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-015-0403-8													WOS:000355228400002

However, impacts on boreal lake ecosystems in eastern Siberia remain underexplored. Our aim is to determine if shifts in diatom assemblages in a remote lake in eastern Siberia are related to climate warming, similar to observations in temperate regions, while also exploring how the ecosystem might be influenced by hydroclimate and human-induced air pollution. We analysed continuous sediment samples from a 210Pb-137Cs-dated short core from Lake Khamra (59.99 degrees N, 112.98 degrees E), covering similar to 220 years (ca. 1790-2015 CE), following a multiproxy approach on the same sample material to provide a comprehensive record of environmental changes. Biogeochemical proxies include total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and corresponding stable isotopes of bulk sediment samples (delta 13C, delta 15N), as well as diatom silicon isotopes (delta 30Sidiatom), alongside light microscope diatom species analysis. The diatom assemblage at Lake Khamra is dominated by few planktonic species, primarily Aulacoseira subarctica and Aulacoseira ambigua. At ca. 1970 CE, we observe a major shift in diatom assemblages, characterised by a marked increase in the planktonic species Discostella stelligera and a decrease in both Aulacoseira taxa. We attribute these changes to recent global warming, which is likely associated with earlier ice-out and enhanced summer thermal stratification, consistent with similar observations in temperate lake ecosystems. A rapid increase in chrysophyte scales (Mallomonas) from the 1990s onward further supports an increasing thermal stratification of the lake driven by rising temperatures. Biogeochemical proxies indicate substantial limnological changes around 1950 CE, preceding the major shift in diatom communities, likely driven by hydroclimatic variability. Increased precipitation and weathering are further discussed in order to explain changing silica sources leading to decreasing delta 30Sidiatom after similar to 1970CE. Nevertheless, the interpretation of delta 30Sidiatom in lacustrine systems is complex, likely influenced by both in-lake biogeochemical processes and catchment dynamics. Indications of anthropogenic influences on Lake Khamra include a delta 13C depletion, likely linked to fossil fuel combustion and emissions, coinciding with industrial growth in Asia and Russia. Nonetheless, we find no evidence for atmospheric nitrogen deposition. We conclude that the Lake Khamra ecosystem is severely affected by climate warming and shows indications of human influence. This emphasises the urgent need for comprehensive research to mitigate these impacts on remote lake ecosystems in order to secure natural water resources.

J	Epp, RG; Erickson, DJ; Paul, ND; Sulzberger, B				Epp, R. G.; Erickson, D. J., III; Paul, N. D.; Sulzberger, B.			Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycling	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												This report assesses research on the interactions of UV radiation (280-400 nm) and global climate change with global biogeochemical cycles at the Earth's surface. The effects of UV-B (280-315 nm), which ate dependent on the stratospheric ozone layer, on biogeochemical cycles are often linked to concurrent exposure to UV-A radiation (315-400 nm), which is influenced by global climate change. These interactions involving UV radiation (the combination of UV-B and UV-A) are central to the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B radiation has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with implications for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. The cycling of carbon and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen can be affected by UV-B-mediated changes in communities of soil organisms, probably due to the effects of UV-B radiation on plant root exudation and/or the chemistry of dead plant material falling to the soil. In and environments direct photodegraclation can play a major role in the decay of plant litter, and UV-B radiation is responsible for a significant part of this photodegraclation. UV-B radiation strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metals cycling that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B radiation changes the biological availability of dissolved organic matter to microorganisms, and accelerates its transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium. The coloured part of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) controls the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies, but CDOM is also photodegraded by solar UV radiation. Changes in CDOM influence the penetration of UV radiation into water bodies with major consequences for aquatic biogeochemical processes. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply occur concurrently with exposure to increased UV-B radiation, and have synergistic effects on the penetration of light into aquatic: ecosystems. Future changes in climate will enhance stratification of lakes and the ocean, which will intensify photodegradation of CDOM by UV radiation. The resultant increase in the transparency of water bodies may increase UV-B effects on aquatic biogeochemistry in the surface layer. Changing solar UV radiation and climate also interact to influence exchanges of trace gases, such as halocarbons (e.g., methyl bromide) which influence ozone depletion, and sulfur gases (e.g., dimethylsulfide) that oxidize to produce sulfate aerosols that cool the marine atmosphere. UV radiation affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting metal toxicity and the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Future changes in ecosystem distribution due to alterations in the physical and chemical climate interact with ozone-modulated changes in UV-B radiation. These interactions between the effects of climate change and UV-B radiation on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic, systems may partially offset the beneficial effects of an ozone recovery.

We conducted a large-scale (4 ha) restoration experiment in an isolated part of Lake Yanglan, a shallow eutrophic lake in subtropical China. Here, lanthanum-modified bentonite and polyaluminium chloride were applied after fish removal, followed by transplantation of submerged macrophytes. Samples were collected from within the experimentally restored area and the unrestored area of the lake throughout the study period (August 2017 to May 2018), and data were compared for three periods: 1) fish removal period, 2) chemical treatment and macrophyte transplantation period, and 3) after full restoration. Compared to the unrestored area, water clarity (Secchi depth, SD) increased, total suspended solids and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations decreased significantly in the restored area across the whole study period, while total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations declined significantly in the second and third period. Phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll alpha concentrations, Chl a) decreased significantly during fish removal in period 1 and after full restoration in period 3, but not in the intervening chemical treatment in period 2. After full restoration, mean SD had increased by a factor of 6.2 (from 29 to 181 cm), mean TN had decreased by 26 % (from 1.68 to 1.25 mg/L), TP by 72 % (from 0.18 to 0.05 mg/L), and Chl a by 78 % (from 49 to 11 mu g/L) in the restored area compared to the control. The mobile phosphorus content of surface sediments significantly decreased after full restoration. The zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the restored area increased after full restoration, peaking in March when Daphnia abundance was high, indicating enhanced grazing control on phytoplankton. However, the ratio was low in the warm months, likely due to fish recruitment that led to stronger predation on zooplankton. Our eight-month experiment showed that a clear-water state can be successfully restored using a combined approach of biomanipulation and chemical in a subtropical shallow lake. Yet, given that external and internal nutrient loading may increase and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio decrease in summer due to the region's subtropical monsoon climate, maintaining a stable clear-water state in the long term may require additional measures such as periodic thinning of the fish stock and/or chemical treatment.

J	McCarty, JA				McCarty, J. A.			ALGAL DEMAND DRIVES SEDIMENT PHOSPHORUS RELEASE IN A SHALLOW EUTROPHIC COVE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Algae play an important role in the internal nutrient cycling of shallow lakes and coves. Algae of shallow water bodies have been shown to thrive and even lead to eutrophic conditions despite a lack of measurable quantities of biologically available phosphorus (P) in the water during summer months. To study how sediment P release and algal growth are connected, water and sediment samples were collected in a shallow eutrophic cove on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas. Water quality profiles depicting temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, metals, and photic zone chlorophyll-a were collected weekly from 21 May to 10 July 2018 at three points in the cove: one shallow, one at the cove midpoint, and one at the deepest part of the cove. Cove sediment samples were collected at similar points as the water quality samples for equilibrium P concentration (EPCo) analysis, sediment core incubation, and sediment composition. EPCo for the sediments ranged from 0.024 to 0.027 mg L-1. Sediment cores exposed to aerobic conditions typical of shallow areas had P release rates ranging from 1.37 to 2.02 mg m(-2) d(-1). Concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP) in the water column from the weekly water quality sampling averaged 0.002 +/- 0.003 mg L-1, and photic zone SRP concentrations averaged 0.002. +/- 0.004 mg L-1 for all sampling sites. The chlorophyll-a concentration increased from 10 to 40 mu g L-1 during the period from 21 May to 25 June. When SRP << EPCo, conditions favor the release of SRP from sediments to the overlying water. This was confirmed with the aerobic sediment core incubation in which algal demand was controlled using dark conditions and the release rates were >1.37 mg L-1 d(-1). Core aerobic release rates and EPCo conditions both confirmed the release of P under aerobic conditions; however, it appears that algal demand sustained low SRP conditions. This created a nutrient cycle in which algae imposed a nutrient gradient favoring P release by keeping SRP conditions below the EPCo. This study indicates that algal growth potential in shallow water bodies is not limited by SRP concentrations measured within the water column. Studies of shallow water bodies with low SRP concentrations and high productivity should look to the sediments as a source of P to fuel algal growth. Finally, these findings suggest that coves play an integral part in algal production and should not be overlooked when determining the overall P budget for a lake or reservoir.																			2151-0032	2151-0040					2019	62	5					1315	1324		10.13031/trans.13300	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/trans.13300													WOS:000510170700026

One of the unresolved major issues is whether variations of leaf wax delta D (delta D-wax) signals along a precipitation gradient reflect changes of precipitation delta D, precipitation amount, and/or evapo-transpiration. This ambiguity limits our interpretation of delta D-wax in geological records as well as the quantitative reconstruction of paleohydrological variability. Here we systematically investigated delta D of soil water and waxes extracted from soil and plant leaves in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and its surrounding areas along a precipitation gradient with mean annual precipitation (MAP) varying from 140 mm to 676 mm. The results showed that while the variation of modeled precipitation delta D has no significant correlation with MAP, soil water delta D, soil delta D-wax, and individual plant delta D-wax exhibit negative correlations with MAP. In relatively arid areas, the delta D values of soil water and plant leaf waxes are significantly more positive due to much lower precipitation relative to evapo-transpiration, suggesting that effective precipitation (P:E ratio) has played a crucial role in the D-enrichment of soil and plant leaf waxes in this region. While parallel decreasing trends in delta D-wax are found along the increase of precipitation gradient among dominant plants (including Artemisia spp., Aster hispidus, Stipa bungeana, and Cleistogenes squarrosa) in the region with similar slopes, the large delta D offsets between plant groups suggest that plant type is an important factor in controlling plant hydrogen isotope fractionations. Our results indicate that delta D-wax preserved in paleosols can be used to infer past conditions of water availability in arid and semi-arid inland regions, but with a mechanism that is different from the influence of "amount effect" in humid areas. Moreover, vegetation changes should be constrained by independent paleobotanical data before monsoon related paleohydrology in the CLP and its surrounding areas can be quantitatively reconstructed using the plant wax delta D proxy.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Li, Wenbao/HQZ-4391-2023														0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2024	633								131008	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131008		MAR 2024											WOS:001206176400001
J	Dar, FA; Venkateshwarlu, M; Khan, I; Ahmad, MZ				Dar, Farooq Ahmad; Venkateshwarlu, Mamilla; Khan, Imran; Ahmad, Malik Zubair			Modeling the environment and climatic conditions of Ladakh Himalaya using Quaternary sediments	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												A model of the environmental and climatic conditions in the Ladakh Himalaya is presented by studying the lake sedimentation records preserved in the Shey area of Leh, India. The different layers of the paleolacustrine section were sampled and analyzed for sedimentological, petrological, and magnetic characteristics. The study indicates that a separate lake-damming event, favored by topography, granite bedrock, and moraine and debris material, deposited the 16-m thick sediments. This and similar other past lakes were formed due to the coalescing of southern fan deposits with granite spurs. Locally transported sediments were deposited in three major fluctuating climate and environmental phases. The lower coarser sandy unit represents a fluvial-lacustrine high-energy environment. The middle, thinly laminated clayey unit with uniform characteristics, represents a calm lacustrine and a reducing environment. The topmost 7 m consist of alternating sandy and clayey layers representing an intermittent climate in the catchment. Petrography and magnetic data of the sandy and clayey layers of the section suggest different climates, environments, and mineral assemblages. The average magnetic susceptibility is chi = 0.1 to < 2.9 x 10(-3) and 2.9 to 5.7 x 10(-3) for the clayey and sandy layers, respectively. Magnetic hysteresis indicates wider loops in clayey layers and thinner loops in sandy layers with saturation fields up to 3000 Oe, whereas thermomagnetic curves show a Curie temperature of 580 degree celsius in most the samples. The hysteresis and K-T curves infer that the clayey layers have a predominance of paramagnetic silicate minerals like haematite, maghemite, ilmenite, goethite, and pyrrhotite and a higher concentration of ferrimagnetic magnetic minerals i.e., magnetite, in the sandy layers. The sandy layers represent a warm and humid climate and a good amount of vegetation cover in the catchment. The sediments were generally transported from variable rock types from the nearby glaciated terrain. The clayey layers represent cooler events. The study indicates that warm and moist conditions occurred at around ca. similar to 100 ka BP that coincided with the intensified Indian Summer Monsoon during the warm interstadial MIS 5c event. The event is attributed to increased glacial melting and intense precipitation in the Ladakh region during the warm interstadial period.					; Khan, Imran/KBC-1319-2024; Dar, Farooq/AFP-8458-2022	DAR, FAROOQ AHMAD/0000-0002-2897-7804; 													2363-6203	2363-6211				JUN	2024	10	3					3495	3515		10.1007/s40808-024-01965-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-024-01965-w		MAR 2024											WOS:001177773600001

They were carried out on organic matter (OM) that had been deposited from the Younger Dryas to the Subboreal chronozone in palaolake sediments (north-eastern Poland). OM from the late Younger Dryas consists only a small amount of TOC and TN, which together with the lack of aquatic macrophyte macrofossils confirm low primary production in the then reservoir. The higher values of C/N ratio (18-27) and delta C-13 (ca. -26 parts per thousand) suggest that OM was mainly terrestrial in origin. During the Preboreal chronozone (11,450-10,150 cal. BP), there was a probable deepening of the reservoir through the melting of dead ice. This might have been intensified by an increase in precipitation and a fall in evapotranspiration during the 'Preboreal oscillation'. From the early Preboreal chronozone (ca. 11,345 cal. BP), a mixed source of OM is indicated by C/N ratio (from 8 to 13). At the same time significant increase in TOC and TN probably registered a rise in primary production in the palaeolake. From the older part of the Boreal chronozone (ca. 9865 cal. BP) algae productivity increased (the C/N ratio dropped to ca. 8 and was then constant). At the beginning of the Atlantic chronozone (ca. 8650 cal. BP) a probable increase in the water level caused the partial relocation of OM from the reed swamp belt and/or the adjacent alder carr into deeper sections of the palaeolake (an increase in TOC and TN). In the late Atlantic chronozone (ca. 6965-6650 cal. BP), TOC and TN decreased while delta C-13 had high values, which probably reflected a more distinct stratification of the water column with anoxic bottom waters. Next, in the late Atlantic and early Subboreal chronozone (ca. 6650-5205 cal. BP) the amount of OM in palaeolake sediments was still rising. The delta C-13 values dropped, suggesting an intensification of processes of water mixing. These processes were simultaneous with the constant shallowing of the palaeolake and the disappearance of habitats suitable for submerged macrophytes. The topmost part of the profile is characteristic of a strong decomposition of peat, causing a release of carbon dioxide and therefore the depletion of the carbon pool in the peat (a drop in the C/N ratio). The concurrent upward trend of the delta N-15 curve is probably the effect of a greater anthropogenic impact on the palaeolake/mire and its catchment and/or more recent human interference in the topmost peat layers.

On-Campus Field Experiences Help Students to Learn and Enjoy Water Science During the COVID-19 Pandemic	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Online modes of teaching and learning have gained increased attention following the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in education delivery trends likely to continue for the foreseeable future. It is therefore critical to understand the implications for student learning outcomes and their interest in or affinity towards the subject, particularly in water science classes, where educators have traditionally employed hands-on outdoor activities that are difficult to replicate online. In this study, we share our experiences adapting a field-based laboratory activity on groundwater to accommodate more than 700 students in our largest-enrollment general education course during the pandemic. As part of our adaptation strategy, we offered two versions of the same exercise, one in-person at the Mirror Lake Water Science Learning Laboratory, located on Ohio State University's main campus, and one online. Although outdoor lab facilities have been used by universities since at least the 1970s, this research is novel in that 1) it considers not only student achievement but also affinity for the subject, 2) it is the first of its kind on The Ohio State University's main campus, and 3) it was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time when most university classes were unable to take traditional field trips. We used laboratory grades and a survey to assess differences in student learning and affinity outcomes for in-person and online exercises. Students who completed the in-person exercise earned better scores than their online peers. For example, in Fall 2021, the median lab score for the in-person group was 97.8%, compared to 91.7% for the online group. The in-person group also reported a significant (p < 0.05) increase in how much they enjoyed learning about water, while online students reported a significant decrease. Online students also reported a significant decrease in how likely they would be to take another class in water or earth sciences. It is unclear whether the in-person exercise had better learning and affinity outcomes because of the hands-on, outdoor qualities of the lab or because the format allowed greater interaction among peers and teaching instructors (TAs). To mitigate disparities in student learning outcomes between the online and in-person course delivery, instructors will implement future changes to the online version of the lab to enhance interactions among students and TAs.					; Sawyer, Audrey/W-3729-2017	Lamantia, Kara/0000-0002-1448-3280; Sawyer, Audrey/0000-0001-8174-0542; Chen, Zhaozhe/0000-0003-3964-6573; Schulze, Joseph/0000-0003-3570-422X														2296-665X				MAY 16	2022	10								877327	10.3389/fenvs.2022.877327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.877327													WOS:000804208600001

This basin is a large, tectonically active system, isolated from the ocean and composed of thick elastic and evaporite sediments. The modern playas are subject to intense evaporation and are characterized by hypersaline brines as well as potash and borate evaporites. The chemical composition of the dissolved solutes in the modern brines and waters reveals three main sources: (1) inflow of hot springs enriched in sodium, sulphate and boron. Evaporation of these waters leads to a high Na/Cl ratio (>1), a Na-Cl-SO4 brine and an evaporite mineral assemblage of halite-mirabilite-borate (Lakes Daqaidam and Xiaoqaidam); (2) inflow surface river waters which are modified by preferential dissolution of halite and potassium and magnesium salts characterized by a Na-(Mg)-Cl solute type with low Na/Cl (<1), Br/Cl, Li/Cl and B/Cl ratios; and (3) Ca-chloridic subsurface brines which are controlled by both salt dissolution and dolomitization processes. Evaporation and salt crystallization of mixtures of the latter two types leads to a ''marine-like'' brine (e.g., a Na-Mg-Cl type, Na/Cl ratio <<1) and mineral assemblages similar to that predicted for progressive evaporation of seawater (e.g., Qarhan playa: halite-sylvite-carnallite-bischofite). The delta(11)B-values of the input waters to the Qaidam Basin (range of -0.7 to +10.9 parts per thousand vs. NBS-951) and brines from salt lakes (+0.5 to +15.0 parts per thousand) are similar to those of associated granitic rocks (delta(11)B = -2.3 to +3.7 parts per thousand; n = 3) and hence indicate the non-marine origin of these fluids. The highest delta(11)B-values are associated with fluids with low B/Li ratios, indicating selective removal of elemental boron and B-10 by adsorption onto clay minerals. The magnitude of B-11 enrichment due to adsorption is similar to 15-20 parts per thousand, and thus non-marine brines are well distinguished from marine-derived brines (delta(11)B of +39 to +59 parts per thousand) preserving the large isotopic difference (similar to 40 parts per thousand) of their source waters. It is proposed to use this distinctive isotopic signature for tracing the origin of ancient evaporite environments.					; Vengosh, Avner/AAE-7173-2019; Chivas, Allan/B-4242-2013	Chivas, Allan/0000-0002-1459-6330; Vengosh, Avner/0000-0001-8928-0157; 													0009-2541					FEB 1	1995	120	1-2					135	154		10.1016/0009-2541(94)00118-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(94)00118-R													WOS:A1995QK51900008

The chemical composition of precipitation in Ukraine and its potential impact on the environment and water bodies	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY												This article provides characteristic of the chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation on the territory of Ukraine and its potential impact on the environment and water bodies. In Ukraine, the rainfall is 650 mm/year in the northwest of the country (mixed forests), up to 300 mm/year in the south (steppe zone), in the Ukrainian Carpathians - up to 1,600 mm/year. Acidity of atmospheric precipitation (pH) on the territory of Ukraine according to monitoring meteorological stations is 5.9-6.3. Minimum values of mineralization of atmospheric precipitation are observed in a zone of mixed forests in the north of the country. In particular, according to the weather station of Teteriv, the mineralization of atmospheric precipitation is 27.0 mg/l. In forest-steppe and steppe zones, this rate gradually increases to 35-45 mg/l, reaching a maximum in the steppe zone at the Askania-Nova meteorological station (82.4 mg/l). In the chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation, anion predominates sulfates, and among cations - magnesium. Anthropogenic component of the total mineralization of atmospheric precipitation, calculated for the first time on the territory of Ukraine (meteorological station Kobelyaki) by comparison with the regional natural background, is 69%. Concentration of sulfate ions (8-24 mg/l) in atmospheric precipitation on the territory of Ukraine shows a high level of pollution with sulfur, which corresponds to IV-V levels of environmental pollution. It is noted that with increasing concentrations of sulfates in atmospheric precipitation a tendency towards a decrease in the pH in the water of Svityaz Lake is projected. Current research shows that at high concentrations of sulfates in atmospheric precipitation, the risk of falling individual rains with low pH (so-called acid rains) increases. Waters of high concentration of organic matter and low mineralization of water are widely distributed on the territory of Ukraine (catchments of Polissya and the Carpathian region): up to 100 mg/l in the meadows and up to 30 mg/l in the flood period. Often, the pH of water in them is 6-6.5 and precipitation of acidic precipitation can significantly affect their hydroecological state. The obtained results on the influence of chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation on water objects have a diagnostic character. For more specific results, special synchronized studies of the chemical composition of the water of experimental water reservoirs with sampling of atmospheric precipitation are required.

However, its influence on regional climate in other parts of China is still poorly understood, especially further inland in north China and northwest China. Here we review fossil pollen records available from arid and semi-arid areas of China (including Inner Mongolia, the northwestern Loess Plateau, the northern Tibetan Plateau, and Xinjiang) to document regional patterns of Holocene vegetation and climate change, and to understand the large-scale controls of these changes. Pollen records from the four regions reveal different vegetation and wet-dry changes during the Holocene. With the exception of the westernmost sites, vegetation at most sites in Inner Mongolia switches between forest, forest steppe, and typical steppe. There is a dry climate after similar to 6 ka following early to Early - Mid Holocene maximum moisture conditions. At western sites, the climate was dry in the Early Holocene, wet in the Middle Holocene and dry again in the Late Holocene. Vegetation in the northwestern Loess Plateau switches between desert steppe, steppe, and steppe forest, with corridor forests often occurring in loess valleys during the steppe forest period. These changes indicate wet-dry oscillations, from an initial dry climate to a wet Middle Holocene and then back to a dry climate in the Late Holocene. In the northern Tibetan Plateau, vegetation is characterized by steppe, desert steppe, or desert. However, the Qinghai Lake area was dominated by tree pollen during the Early-and Mid-Holocene, indicating a wet climate, until a drying trend started after 6-4.5 ka. In Xinjiang, pollen assemblages show changes between desert, desert steppe or steppe during the Holocene, with a wet period occurring briefly during the early Mid-Holocene at most sites. The highest moisture interval during the Holocene (the so-called Holocene climate optimum) occurred in the Early-to Mid-Holocene in eastern Inner Mongolia, but apparently occurred later during the Mid-Holocene at sites in the west (northern Tibetan Plateau and Xinjiang). The complex climate patterns during the Holocene in arid and semi-arid China suggest regional climate responses to large-scale climate forcing was controlled by interactions of competing factors including the monsoons, westerlies and topography. The decline of forest in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, the Loess Plateau valleys and Inner Mongolia during the Late Holocene may have been caused by human activity.

J	REHEIS, MC; SLATE, JL; SARNAWOJCICKI, AM; MEYER, CE				REHEIS, MC; SLATE, JL; SARNAWOJCICKI, AM; MEYER, CE			A LATE PLIOCENE TO MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE PLUVIAL LAKE IN FISH LAKE VALLEY, NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The question of whether a pluvial lake existed in Fish Lake Valley, Nevada and California, has been debated for more than 100 yr. New stratigraphic evidence indicates that a lake did exist in this valley at intervals during late Pliocene to middle Pleistocene time. This lake may have drained northward, or it may have been periodically contiguous with a pluvial lake to the north in Columbus Salt Marsh. Proof of the existence of this lake, informally named Pluvial Lake Rennie, is derived from three principal outcrops of shallow-water deposits, two outcrops of deep-water deposits, and several drilling logs. The deposits contain beds of silicic tephra, which provide age control. On the basis of thickness, grain size, major-oxide chemistry of glass shards, and paleomagnetism, three of the shallow-water deposits, including deltaic(?), beach, and siliceous hot-spring sediments, consist mainly of Bishop ash derived from the 0.77 Ma eruption of the Long Valley caldera. A fourth shallow-water deposit(?) is associated with approximately 1 Ma Glass Mountain tephra beds. The exposed deep-water deposits consist of green claystone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone containing tephra derived from the eruptions of the approximately 2.1 Ma tuff of Taylor Canyon and the approximately 2.0 Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff. The drilling logs record numerous thick beds of clay and sandy clay inferred to be deep-water lacustrine deposits. Pluvial Lake Rennie fluctuated in size and depth beginning prior to 2 Ma and continuing until sometime after 0.77 Ma. At about 0.77 Ma, the lake had a highstand at an elevation of approximately 1,460 m, covered an area of 400-500 km2, and had a maximum depth of approximately 250 m. The lake level dropped just after the eruption of the Bishop ash, but the lake may have persisted at a lower level until approximately 0.5 Ma. No large, long-lived lake existed in Fish Lake Valley in late Pleistocene time, probably due to the increasing rain-shadow effect caused by the relative uplift of the White Mountains and Sierra Nevada in the Pleistocene. These results indicate that the late middle to late Pleistocene history of Pluvial Lake Rennie is similar to that of Lake Tecopa but is quite different from those of Lake Lahontan and Searles Lake.																			0016-7606					JUL	1993	105	7					953	967		10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0953:ALPTMP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0953:ALPTMP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LM16000008

We selected Lake Maggiore, one of the most important freshwater reserve in Northern Italy, to study the horizontal and vertical distribution of TEP and of its possible drivers. Samplings along a transect in the Borromeo basin were performed in May, July and September 2019. Total organic carbon (TOC), TEP, chlorophyll-alpha (Chl) of different algal groups, picocyanobacteria, bacteria and eukaryotes counting, were measured at six stations and five depths. Our study showed that TEP exhibited a clear vertical heterogeneity from surface to the bottom related to the autotrophic microorganisms that are the main source of TEP and are prevalent in the euphotic zone of the lake. On the other hand, TEP was fairly evenly distributed along the horizontal transect from littoral to pelagic zone, although patches were present in spring, when TEP concentrations were low. in contrast to TEP, TOC and to a lesser extent Chl and bacteria showed horizontal heterogeneity, in some months. In Lake Maggiore TEP indeed was an important fraction of total organic carbon (TOC), making up to 54% of TOC (in carbon units: 910 mu g C L-1) and it was significantly correlated with Chl. The highest TEP concentration (1.44 mg GX eq L-1) was measured in September 2019, in coincidence with an episode of superficial foam appearance. Considering the biomass as Chl concentrations, the algal group mostly related to TEP was that of brown algae, particularly diatoms; but considering the numbers, the picocyanobacteria and bacteria were more significantly correlated to TEP. The presence of pennate diatoms in May and July, with their TEP-related chlorophyll, did not produce TEP in as high concentration as that observed in September in the presence of centric diatoms and of very high numbers of picocyanobacteria and bacteria.

Effects of recent climate and environmental changes on the ecology of a boreal forest lake in Manitoba, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Application of paleoenvironmental approaches provides insight into the magnitude and timing of responses to climate warming in aquatic-ecosystems of northern Canada. We examined subfossil biological (Diptera:Chironomidae) and geochemical indicators (organic carbon and elemental nitrogen and stable isotope composition) in a sediment core from Buckland Lake, northern Manitoba, to assess the influence of recent warming (1981-2011) in the central subarctic region of Canada. The earlier part of the paleolimnological record (1830-1980) was characterized by relatively low chironomid diversity (N2 similar to 6), consisting primarily of profundal taxa (Orthocladius consobrinus and Chironomus), low organic matter content of sediments (< 12%), low C:N ratios (< 9), and high delta N-15 values (> 3 parts per thousand), indicative of a cold-water environment with low nitrogen demand. Between 1910 and 1980, there was a decline in profundal taxa, with small gradual increases in littoral taxa, such as Cladotanytarsus mancus-group. Post-1980 sediment core intervals had distinct geochemistry, with declines in delta C-13(org) from - 27.5 parts per thousand to almost - 29 parts per thousand, consistent with warming, increased terrestrial influence, and increased snowfall and runoff. We found substantial inferred warming (+ 1-2 degrees C), with several chironomid-inferred temperatures nearly 3 degrees C warmer than typical pre-1980 inferences. Concurrently, several warm-water-adapted littoral chironomid taxa (Cladopelma, Cryptochironomus, Polypedilum) recorded increases. The post-1990 records reflected continued increases in warm-water taxa, changes in the benthic:pelagic trophic structure, and reversal of previous trends in the delta C-13(org), %Organic Carbon, and delta N-15 profiles, suggestive of increased aquatic productivity. The meteorological station at Gillam, Manitoba, also recorded warming (1.5 degrees C) and a reduction in snowfall during that time period. A reduction in spring recharge may have increased littoral habitat associated with lake-level drawdown. The climate-driven shift observed similar to 1980 is in generally good agreement with other regional analyses, which show regime shifts occurred similar to 1995. The earlier lake response (similar to 1980), however, demonstrates the role of increased catchment-mediated influences on northern boreal lake productivity that may only appear in records with sufficiently high resolution and multiple paleolimnological indicators.					; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019	Quinlan, Roberto/0000-0002-6691-795X; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2021	66	1					15	27		10.1007/s10933-021-00180-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00180-2		APR 2021											WOS:000639784400001
J	Yang, XP; Scuderi, L; Paillou, P; Liu, ZT; Li, HW; Ren, XZ				Yang, Xiaoping; Scuderi, Louis; Paillou, Philippe; Liu, Ziting; Li, Hongwei; Ren, Xiaozong			Quaternary environmental changes in the drylands of China - A critical review	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper reviews our current understanding of Quaternary climate and landscape changes in the desert areas of northern China, a key portion of the middle-latitude drylands on Earth. Combining earlier studies with our recent research and experience, we offer a comprehensive picture of the state of Chinese deserts during the Quaternary and, in the interest of enhancing future research, identify knowledge gaps and areas of uncertainty. Lacustrine deposits found over an area ranging from China's western Taklamakan Desert to the eastern Hunshandake Sandy Lands suggest that extensive lakes occurred in China's deserts during the Pleistocene. Analysis of digital elevation models from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data supports this interpretation and shows the significant extent of these former lakes. New estimates of mean annual evaporation of ca. 1000 mm from lake surfaces and ca. 100 mm from land surfaces, confirms that local and regional rainfall is critical for maintenance of desert lakes in this temperate zone, especially during intervals when the mean annual rainfall is more than 100 mm. Rapid shifts between sand seas and lakes in geologically and environmentally diverse settings suggest that the drylands of China are very sensitive ephemeral systems, and not long-lasting as previously thought. Available chronologies suggest that there were large lakes in the western Taklamakan Desert and the Chadamu Basin during MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 3, at similar to 30 ka, probably related to a period of strong influence of northern hemispheric westerly winds. Channels and elevation models revealed by SRTM data and remains of lacustrine sediments also indicate that there was a large lake in the Hunshandake Sandy Lands in the eastern portion of the desert belt during the Quaternary. There is significant evidence that during the middle Holocene strong summer monsoons led to a relatively large increase in moisture availability in the entire desert belt of northern China. Lacustrine records from the Badain Jaran Desert in western Inner Mongolia suggest that it was generally dry before 10 cal ka, becoming wetter from 10 to 4 cal ka, and dry again afterwards. Study of palaeosols widely occurring in dune stratigraphy in the eastern portion of the desert belt, suggests that there was a period of wet and warm climate in this region during the mid-Holocene Optimum, at a minimum between 6 ka and 4 ka, but possibly lasting longer. Recent observations dealing with the generation and transport of dust from Central Asia indicate that the causal relationship between sand seas and loess sequences is not as close as previously assumed. These results suggest that there is an urgent need to examine whether the frequency and amplitude of climatic variation in Chinese deserts are somehow similar to that having occurred in the Sahara Desert of North Africa. Deserts in northern China were also important focal regions for Neolithic cultures during intervals when environmental conditions supported a denser vegetative cover. There is evidence that some areas of woody vegetation to the west of Badain Jaran Desert were deforested by humans by ca. 4000 yr B P. although it is still debatable whether humans have had a significant impact in other areas at that time. Opinions on the severity of desertification vary and are sometimes contradictory due to the lack of long-term, field-based, investigations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chiang, CH				Chiang, Chih-hua			Evidence for human-environment interactions as the driver for the abandonment of long-term Neolithic occupation at the Wansan site (NE Taiwan) around the 7th century BCE	ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA												The purpose of this study is to investigate how the Neolithic Wansan people in the Yilan Plain in NE Taiwan interacted with their environment from ca. 2070 to 540 BCE. As an island prone to natural disaster, Taiwanese scholars tend to attribute the abandonment of prehistoric settlements to the influence of climate change and overlook the contribution of human activity to environmental change. This research investigates the temporal-spatial variation of the intra-site scale archaeological material excavated at the Neolithic Wansan site, which is located on a small isolated hill, to explore the complexity of how humans interacted with their surroundings on a daily basis. It applies Bayesian modelling to a set of radiocarbon dates to construct a refined chronology for the prehistoric human habitation. Based on the analysis of stratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, and the spatial layout of archaeological features and objects, I demonstrate how the Neolithic Wansan people established the settlement by modifying the sloping terrain into several terraces, carving the bedrock to store goods and bury their deceased, and utilizing rocks from the hill to make tools and assemble coffins, hearths, and other alignments needed for daily life. However, these activities potentially worsened the already fragile sloped environment of this small hill. Together with the rainy climate, the long-term exploitation of this fragile and sloping terrain probably forced the Wansan people to invest time and energy in sustaining their environment. Growing re-quirements for maintaining the hill environment may have eventually motivated the Neolithic inhabitants to leave their settlement by 540 BCE. Although well-dated paleoenvironmental records from suitable archives covering the Neolithic period for the study region are still scarce, there is initial evidence that continuously increasing winter monsoon precipitation may have further enhanced human-driven erosional processes on the hill. The research thus demonstrates that together with paleoclimate reconstructions, study of archaeological sites can provide us with a more nuanced and direct understanding of the relationship between humans and their environment.																			2352-2267	2352-2275				JUN	2022	30								100365	10.1016/j.ara.2022.100365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ara.2022.100365		FEB 2022											WOS:000777336500001
J	GARCES, BLV				GARCES, BLV			LACUSTRINE DEPOSITION AND RELATED VOLCANISM IN A TRANSTENSIONAL TECTONIC SETTING - UPPER STEPHANIAN LOWER AUTUNIAN IN THE ARAGON-BEARN BASIN, WESTERN PYRENEES (SPAIN FRANCE)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Stephanian to Early Autunian lacustrine series are exposed in the Aragon-Bearn Basin (western Pyrenees) and comprise two main lithostratigraphic units that represent the infilling of a closed lake located in a transtensional setting accompanied by extensive pyroclastic deposition. The Lower Lacustrine Unit overlies epiclastic conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones and it is mainly formed of massive and laminated grey limestones, laminated carbonates and grey, organic-rich, tuffaceous siltstones. A freshwater, probably stratified, lake with frequent depth fluctuations is proposed for this first stage. Limestones show very light deltaO-18 values (- 10 to - 14 parts per thousand PDB) believed to represent a primary isotopic signal which is consistent with an intracontinental setting of the basin and the influx of O-18-depleted meteoric waters derived from the adjacent Hercynian mountains. A wide-spread pyroclastic flow deposit marks the limit with the Upper Lacustrine Unit which comprises the following lithofacies: pisolitic dolostones, stromatolites, massive and laminated dolostones and limestones, and variegated siltstones. This final stage of the lake infilling is interpreted as a shallow, brackish environment. The transition between both units is marked by nodular limestones and dolomitization of some limestone layers, but the stable isotopic composition remains similar to the lower unit. Strong evaporative concentration, shallow well-mixed waters and re-equilibration with the atmospheric reservoir are suggested by the heavier deltaO-18 (- 2 to - 10) and deltaC-13 (0 to - 4) values in the dolomites and the heavier deltaC-13 values in the limestones (- 1.5 to + 2). The lacustrine episode ended with the progradation of an alluvial plain. Because many documented lacustrine deposits in volcanic settings are poor in carbonates, the Stephanian-Autunian series provide a case study for concomitant carbonate and pyroclastic deposition. High volcanic inputs are implied by the tuffaceous facies, the ubiquitous presence of volcanic and pyroclastic components in both detrital and carbonatic facies, and by the numerous intercalated pyroclastic layers. Several criteria are applied to discriminate subaerial and sublacustrine pyroclastic fall-out and flow deposits. Similar lake sequences are found in other Stephanian-Autunian basins in Western Europe suggesting that sedimentation in the Variscan continental basins reflects the dominant climate of the time.

The vuggy/cement interval is 12-16 m below core top, and most of the interval is below the modern water table (13 m). The top of the interval corresponds to the top of the 194 ka coral reef terrace, which is unconformably overlain by the 122 ka terrace. ARC was precipitated after a period of meteoric diagenesis during which vuggy porosity was produced. ARC shows variable ultrastructures, including (1) loosely packed, randomly oriented rays (< 1 mm long), (2) coalescing splays of elongate fibers (up to 5 mm long) radiating from the substrate, and most commonly, (3) closely packed isopachous rays (4 mm long) that are oriented perpendicular to large vug walls. Generally, ARC is pristine, but evidence of minor dissolution and incipient replacement by LMC microspar is present in some samples from below the modern water table. The 100% ARC has uncharacteristically low deltaC-13 values relative to predicted and reported values for marine aragonite cement. Likewise, the deltaO-18 values are lower than both reported and most predicted deltaO-18 values for marine aragonite. Stable-isotope compositions of this cement fall along a mixing line between aragonite equilibrium compositions calculated for meteoric and marine end-member fluids. Strontium concentrations are greater than in most known marine aragonite; this suggests precipitation from fluids with an elevated Sr/Ca ratio. Such fluids are found in modern Barbados mixed waters whose elevated Sr/Ca ratios result from updip meteoric dissolution of aragonite. Magnesium concentrations are slightly higher and more variable than in reported Pleistocene marine aragonite. Sodium concentrations are lower than expected marine values and covary with changes in deltaC-13 and deltaO-18 values. Isotope and minor-element geochemistry of these cements suggests precipitation from mixed meteoric-marine waters. Fluid mixing models for modern Barbados waters suggest precipitation from mixed fluids ranging from 50% to 75% seawater. Precipitation of aragonite from mixed waters may be facilitated by degassing of CO2-charged mixed waters within large vugs and by Mg/Ca ratios sufficiently elevated to inhibit precipitation of calcite.

J	Cheng, SJ; Li, MC; Wang, SS; Liang, SJ				Cheng, Shanjun; Li, Mingcong; Wang, Shanshan; Liang, Sujie			Spatial patterns of torrential rain in the Haihe River Basin and the corresponding large-scale circulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The classification of torrential rain is crucial to the flood mitigation and water resources, but the relevant research in the Haihe River Basin (HRB) is lacking. In this study, 156 regional torrential rain events from 1972 to 2022 were classified into two types using cluster analysis: eastern type and southern type. The eastern type is the typical torrential rain in the HRB, accounting for 61.5% of the total days, whereas the southern type mainly occurs in the piedmont plain with larger intensity and scope, which would pose more severe hazards. Corresponding large-scale circulation patterns of the two types reveal a clear relationship between the HRB torrential rain and ascending motion, associated with the anomalies of low-level moisture convergence and upper-level wind divergence. The anomalous upper-level divergence is accompanied by the northward expansion of South Asian High and intensified westerly jets. In the eastern type, strong low-pressure anomalies north of Lake Baikal at mid-level produce anomalous northwesterlies. The cold air from mid-high latitudes encounters enhanced southwesterly moist air accompanied by the northward expansion of Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), resulting in the low-level moisture convergence. In the southern type, the low-level anomalous convergence is caused by a relatively weak cyclonic anomaly and significantly strengthened southeasterly moisture from the Pacific. The enhancement of southwesterlies results from the cooperative effect of the remarkably northwesterly WPSH and low-pressure anomalies in South China Sea. As a whole, the eastern type is the result of convergence of cold air and southwesterly moisture driven by a dipole pattern at mid-high latitudes, whereas the southern type is mainly attributed to the accumulation of abundant southeasterly water vapour. This classification can identify high-risk areas for torrential rain in the HRB and contribute to the forecast skills of extreme precipitation. Torrential rain in the Haihe River Basin was classified into two types. The eastern type is the typical type, driven by a dipole pattern at mid-high latitudes. The southern type occurs in the piedmont plain with larger intensity, mainly attributed to the accumulation of abundant southeasterly water vapour.image					Wang, Shanshan/ABB-9121-2020; Mingcong, Li/JOK-3935-2023	Wang, Shanshan/0000-0001-6373-8908; Cheng, Shanjun/0000-0003-4361-4208; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JAN	2024	44	1					237	252		10.1002/joc.8325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8325		DEC 2023											WOS:001123777700001

Three tumor-bearing and three tumor-free walleyes were collected in the spring from Oneida Lake, New York, and analyzed for viral infection and transcriptional activity. Specifically, the target organs for viral infection and supporting viral transcriptional activity were determined by assessing for the presence of WDSV DNA and RNA in the brain, liver, kidney, skin, and spleen. For each organ, WDSV DNA and RNA were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) respectively. Quantitative estimates of the number of viral DNA and RNA copies were obtained in each case by comparing the signal intensity of the sample to that of external controls. WDSV RNA/DNA ratios, based on those quantitative estimates, were computed for each organ. An RNA/DNA ratio of 3 was arbitrarily chosen as the threshold above which there was viral transcriptional activity. Viral DNA was found in all the organs examined from the three tumor-free walleyes. In those three tumor-free walleyes, low levels of WDSV RNA were detected in only one kidney and two spleen samples. In the three tumor-bearing walleyes, viral DNA was found in one brain, one kidney, two liver, and two skin samples. In contrast to the few organs from tumor-free walleyes in which WDSV RNA was detected, in tumor-bearing walleyes WDSV RNA was present in the one brain examined and in 2/3 kidney, 2/3 liver, 3/3 skin, and 3/3 spleen samples. A WDSV RNA/DNA ratio above 3 was obtained in all three tumor-bearing walleyes but in only one tumor-free fish. These data indicated that 1) both tumor-bearing and tumor-free walleyes were infected by WDSV, 2) many cell types were targeted by WDSV and supported viral transcription, and 3) tumor-bearing walleyes harbored a transcriptionally active WDSV, whereas tumor-free walleyes contained mostly silent WDSV DNA.																			0300-9858					JAN	1996	33	1					66	73		10.1177/030098589603300107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/030098589603300107								8826007					WOS:A1996TR22000007

Volcanic and structural evolution of the Okataina Volcanic Centre; dominantly silicic volcanism associated with the Taupo Rift, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Joint Annual Conference of the Geological-Society-of-New-Zealand/New-Zealand-Geophysical-Society	NOV 26-29, 2007	Tauranga, NEW ZEALAND	Geol Soc New Zealand, New Zealand Geophys Soc				The Okataina Volcanic Centre (OVC) contains the northeastern most caldera complex in onshore Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), New Zealand, sited largely within the Taupo Rift. Pyroclastic fall deposits and ignimbrites deposited in the Bay of Plenty coast area between 420 and 625 ka were probably erupted from OVC, and these provide a maximum age for the centre. The earliest ignimbrite for which there is good evidence for eruption from OVC is the c.550 ka Quartz-biotite Ignimbrite, exposed to the west of Lake Okataina and to SE of OVC. This ignimbrite probably correlates with one of the early ignimbrites found in the Kawerau geothermal wells, and is large enough to have been accompanied by caldera collapse. It was followed by extensive rhyolitic explosive eruptions of the Murupara Subgroup. culminating with eruption of the Matahina Ignimbrite at c.325 ka. This c.160 km(3) (magma Volume) eruption was accompanied by caldera collapse to form the southern part of the present day Okataina caldera complex. A long duration sequence of rhyolite lavas and pyroclastics was then erupted on the southern and western sides of OVC, before eruption of the > 100 km(3) Rotoiti Pyroclastics at c.61 ka was accompanied by caldera collapse on the northern side of the centre. The Rotoiti episode was followed by an intensive period of intra-caldera volcanic activity which is still going on today. The Mangaone Subgroup pyroclastics were erupted between 40 and 31 ka, and include the c.33 ka Kawerau Ignimbrite (similar to 20 km(3)), large enough to have caused further minor caldera collapse. In the last 26 ka, nine rhyolite eruption episodes have built the Haroharo and Tarawera lava and pyroclastic massifs (>85 km(3) magma volume) within the caldera complex. The structural boundaries of the OVC calderas are buried by the products of later eruptions, but are probably controlled by regional tectonic features. Both the Matahina and Rotoiti calderas appear to have embayments which represent downsags where magma has migrated along regional structures associated with the Taupo Rift. OVC is sited at a major offset within the young Taupo Rift and represents a structurally complex transfer zone. Some early rhyolite domes are aligned north-northwest suggesting control by structures in the subvolcanic basement, while more recent domes are aligned northeastwards, reflecting the orientation of the Taupo Rift. Southwestward propagation of the axial rift of the Whakatane segment and northeastward propagation of the Kapenga segment have created two linear vent zones through OVC (Harcharo and Tarawera). At Tarawera, fissures and near surface dikes formed during the 10 June 1886 basalt eruption are oblique to the vent lineation suggesting some near surface strike-slip component consistent with OVC being in a zone of transtension.

Plant Community Structure within a Reclamation Field Trial and Forested Reference Sites in a Post-Mine Environment	FORESTS												Early successional plant community assemblage within a reclamation field trial at the Detour Lake Mine in northeastern Ontario is assessed, and compared with reference forested and historically reclaimed sites. The reclamation field trial examines eight amendment treatment combinations that include treatments with a winter kill cover crop of oats, fertilizer, biosolids, peat, and combinations thereof. The objectives of this study are to: (1) Investigate how soil amendments influence plant functional group establishment and growth in mine overburden; and (2) Explore the amendment properties that best support the establishment and growth of a plant community that resembles the baseline reference sites. Currently, the presence of non-native species and a dominant woody plant community explains the largest proportion of variance between the forested upland and lowland reference sites and all reclaimed sites. Similar to non-native species, graminoids were absent from the upland forested reference sites. The difference in the graminoid community explains much of the variance between the forested reference sites and all reclaimed sites. The cumulative additions of fertilizer and peat increased alpha diversity of non-native and graminoid plants within the amendment treatments, which had greater alpha diversity of these plant functional groups than the forested reference sites. Within the amendment treatments, non-native and graminoid alpha diversity was initially greater in the nutrient treatments, but by 2019 there was no significant difference in non-native or graminoid alpha diversity between amendment treatments. The results indicate that applications of nutrients through fertilizer or biosolids may increase graminoid alpha diversity and abundance within reclamation units in year 1. The results also confirm that the vascular plant community composition present within the historically reclaimed sites and amendment treatments does not resemble the forested reference sites. The plant community present within the amendment treatment sites is best described as early successional, with the presence of non-native herbaceous legumes dominating the historically reclaimed sites. Despite this, the results indicate that fertilizer and biosolids-based treatments have developed a vascular plant community, excluding woody species that is more similar to the forested reference sites than the peat-based treatments. Further research and long-term monitoring are needed to determine which amendment treatment will best support a plant community that resembles the forested reference sites. In addition, future studies of this nature might consider including wildfire affected and post-harvested forest stands as additional reference sites, to better capture possible plant community trajectories of a severely disturbed environment.

J	Ejsmont-Karabin, J; Karabin, A				Ejsmont-Karabin, Jolanta; Karabin, Andrzej			THE SUITABILITY OF ZOOPLANKTON AS LAKE ECOSYSTEM INDICATORS: CRUSTACEAN TROPHIC STATE INDEX	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Industrial processes and the use of fertilizers are the main causes for the rapid eutrophication of lakes. Different indices, both chemical and biological, may be used to assess a level and a rate of the eutrophication process. Zooplankton indices can be among them, as zooplankton community structure is determined primarily by the physical and chemical environment and modified by biological interactions, i.e. predation and interspecific competition for food resources. Among biological indices of trophic state of lake, those based on densities and structure of crustacean communities seem to respond weaker. There are, however, patterns of crustacean communities connected with trophic state of lakes. Thus, an increase in trophic state causes: (1) an increase in the total numbers of crustaceans; (2) an increase in the total biomass of Cydopoida; (3) an increase in the contribution of the biomass of Cydopidae to the total crustacean biomass; (4) an increase in the ratio of the biomass of Cydopoida to the biomass of Cladocera; (5) a decrease in the average body weight of Crustacea; (6) an increase in the ratio of Cladocera to Calanoida numbers; (7) an increase in the ratio of Cydopoida to Calanoida numbers; (8) an increase in the dominance of species indicative of high trophy (Mesocyclops leuckartii, Thermocyclops oithonoides, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina (Eubosmina) coregoni thersites) in the numbers of all indicative species. Crustacean zooplankton was sampled at the deepest place in a lake at 1 m intervals from the surface to the bottom of epilimnion layer, and then samples were pooled together for the layer. Samples were taken once a year, during the summer stagnation. The material was collected from a total of 41 dimictic and 33 polymictic lakes within Masurian Lake District, Ilawa Lake District and Lubawa Upland. Among above-mentioned indices, six were the best correlated with trophic state of lakes. Below are formulas which enable to assess trophic state of lakes regardless of their mixis type (TSICR) from parameters of abundance and structure of crustacean communities: (1) TSICR1 = 25.5 N-0.142 (R-2 = 0.32), where TSI = trophic state index; N = numbers (id. I-1); (2) TSICR2 = 57.6 Busi (R-2 = 0.37), where B = biomass (mg w.wt. I-1); (3) TSICR3 = 40.9 CB0.097 (R-2 = 0.35), where CB = percentage of biomass of Cyclopoida in the total biomass of Crustacea (%); (4) TSICR4 = 58.3 (CY/CL)(0.071) (R-2 = 0.30), where CY/CL = ratio of the Cydopoida biomass to the biomass of Cladocera (%); (5) TSICR5, = 5.08 Ln (CY/CA) + 46.6 (R-2 = 0.37), where CY/CA = ratio of Cydopoida numbers to the numbers of Calanoida; (the relationship covering exclusively dimictic lakes); (6) TSICR6 = 43.8 e(0.004 (IHT)) (R-2 = 0.30), where IHT = percentage of species indicative of high trophy in the indicative group's numbers. It was assumed that the lakes with a TSICR under 45 are mesotrophic, those with a TSICR value of 45-55 are meso-eutrophic, those with a TSICR value of 55-65 - eutrophic and those with a TSICR above 65- hypertrophic. Although crustacean indices of trophic state of lakes seem to be less useful than other biological indices, they may be recommended in assessing the quality of lake waters.																			1505-2249						2013	61	3					561	573																WOS:000324790100012
S	Boak, J; Poole, S		Smith, ME; Carroll, AR		Boak, Jeremy; Poole, Sheven			Mineralogy of the Green River Formation in the Piceance Creek Basin, Colorado	STRATIGRAPHY AND PALEOLIMNOLOGY OF THE GREEN RIVER FORMATION, WESTERN USA	Syntheses in Limnogeology											Quantitative X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on 82 samples spanning the Green River Formation in the Piceance Creek Basin of Colorado. Samples represented basin margin (outcrop sections in Douglas Pass), and basin center (Savage 24-1 and Shell 23X-2 core) depositional environments. Bulk mineralogy is integrated into a stratigraphic framework of lake stages, incorporating variations in organic richness. Twenty-eight Douglas Pass samples consist of argillaceous, siliceous, feldspathic and dolomitic mudstone and siltstone composed predominantly of clay minerals, quartz, carbonate minerals, feldspar, and analcime. Fifteen Shell 23X-2 well samples cover the lower third of the basin center section. Data for 35 additional Shell 23-X2 samples from the U. S. Geological Survey core database were added to the dataset. The lower 24 Shell 23-X2 samples consist of argillaceous and siliceous mudstone and siltstone composed of clay minerals, carbonate minerals, quartz, feldspar and dawsonite. The upper 26 samples overlap the lower John Savage well section. Thirty-nine Savage 24-1 well samples cover the upper 2/3 of the basin center section. With the upper part of the Shell 23-X2 well samples, they consist of feldspathic and dolomitic mudstone and siltstone composed of feldspar, carbonate minerals, quartz, nahcolite [NahCO(3)], dawsonite [NaAl(OH)2(CO3)], and clay minerals. Buddingtonite [(NH4) AlSi3O8 center dot 0.5H(2)O] comprises a significant fraction of the feldspar. Overall, basin center samples are clay-poor (6 %), and organic matter-rich (12 %), whereas basin margin samples are clay-rich (22 %), with more diverse clay types, and less organic matter (7 %). Divalent carbonates are dominantly dolomite-ankerite, with calcite essentially absent in the middle basin center, but commonly present in the basin margin section. Buddingtonite, nahcolite, dawsonite, and halite (NaCl) are common in the basin center, but sparse to absent in the basin margin, whereas analcime (NaAlSi2O6 center dot H2O) is abundant in the basin margin (max 37 %), and sparse in the basin center. Changes in mineralogy are related to lake stages (as defined by Tanavsuu-Milkeviciene and Sarg 2012), including a sharp reduction in clay and increase in authigenic dawsonite and feldspar content during Stage 2 (transitional lake), and a fall in quartz and dawsonite near the end of Stage 3 (rapidly fluctuating lake) in the basin center. These changes are attributed to reactions controlled by variations in salinity, alkalinity, pH, and silica concentration. Halite and nahcolite reflect saturation in the deep lake center. Differences between basin margin and center likely reflect varying lake levels but persistent stratification of the lake throughout most of its history. Mineralogic variations in the Green River Formation have relevance to other organic-rich shale and mudstone formations in lacustrine and potentially even in marine environments where organic matter preservation is enhanced by water column stratification.																			2211-2731		978-94-017-9906-5; 978-94-017-9905-8				2015	1						183	209		10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5_8	10.1007/978-94-017-9906-5												WOS:000380960200009
J	PARNELL, RA				PARNELL, RA			HYDROLOGIC CONTROL OF CHEMICAL DISEQUILIBRIA IN SOIL AND SURFACE WATERS, SOGNDAL, NORWAY	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Two small (96,290 and 7,220 m2) gneissic bedrock, alpine watersheds with thin (< 50 cm) Haplumbrept soils were used to quantify the role of antecedent soil moisture conditions in fractionating unsaturated zone flow. Soil solutions were collected with 66 lysimeters of two types, one proven to collect primarily gravitational (macropore) flow and one proven to collect capillary (micropore) flow. Irrigation experiments over a 4-year period used 30-mm events. The manipulated catchment received pH 3.4 water, acidified with sulfuric acid and LiBr tracer, while the control catchment was irrigate with unacidified water with LiBr. Waters were applied only to the terrestrial parts of the watersheds and not directly to the lakes. Antecedent soil moisture conditions ranging from 18 to 53 wt% water produce significant variations in soil solution flowpath in both watersheds. These variations, in turn, create significant differences in the compositions and relative volumes of macropore, micropore and surface waters. Tracer results from the manipulated catchment demonstrate that soil waters reach the lake sooner under the driest conditions and that flows are restricted to the upper 20 cm of soil under wetter conditions. Under progressively drier conditions, the pH of all soil waters (macropore and micropore, shallow and deep) decreases, while inorganic monomeric Al (IMAL), Ca and sulfate all increase in deep soil waters, but remain relatively constant in shallow waters. Saturation indices for aluminum hydroxide phases are constant, averaging - 0.14 +/- 0.11 for microcrystalline gibbsite, only in shallow soil solutions. Deeper macropore and micropore solutions show increasing undersaturation with drier conditions. Drier antecedent conditions increase the importance of macropore flow, reduce the amount of flow along the organic-mineral soil interface, decrease the contact and residence time of soil waters resulting in a faster release to lakes of more acidic waters with higher IMAL concentrations. Thus, precipitation events occurring during prolonged dry periods may create more toxic conditions than those observed during the ''acid slug'' events during early spring runoff.																			0009-2541	1872-6836				MAR 15	1993	105	1-3					101	115		10.1016/0009-2541(93)90121-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(93)90121-X													WOS:A1993KW04100008

Negative ion measurements by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Electron Spectrometer (ELS) give evidence for formation of unsaturated anion carbon chains, while positive ion measurements of the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) indicate formation of more aromatic cation hydrocarbons. There is presently no direct observational evidence for large neutral molecule growth in Titan's thermosphere-ionosphere. The hydrocarbon cations are expected to form Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), those with the addition of nitrogen being called PAHNs. We theorize anion carbon chains can eventually become long enough to fold into fullerene C-60,C-70 carbon shells, of various charge states. Based on laboratory data the fullerenes can trap incoming O+ magnetospheric ions that have relatively high energy collisions with the fullerenes and, once trapped, protect the oxygen atom from Titan's reducing thermosphere-ionosphere. The fullerenes can form into larger onion fullerenes and condense into larger embryo aerosols (i.e., m/q > 10,000 amu/q anions as observed by CAPS/ELS) eventually falling onto Titan's surface and precipitating to the bottom of its hydrocarbon lakes. Molecule production composed of H, C, N is known to occur in Titan's atmosphere with energy input from the magnetosphere, solar UV, and deeppenetrating irradiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Space radiation effects by GCR irradiation of Titan's surface and lakes can lead to the manufacture of exobiological molecules with oxygen as the new ingredient. We have developed a model of galactic cosmic ray irradiation of Titan's atmosphere, surface, subsurface and bottoms of Titan lakes. GCR would provide further energy for processing of the aerosols into more complex organic forms such as tholins and precursor molecules for amino acids. A second process called hydrolysis then converts the precursor molecules into amino acids. Hydrolysis is provided via meteor impacts with size >10 km and cryovolcanism both which can produce liquid water on Titan's surface for episodic periods > several 100 to 1000 years. Our model shows that GCR secondary particles can penetrate similar to 100 m below the ice surface (including the bottom of Titan's less dense hydrocarbon lakes similar to 150 m depths) and produce chemically significant dosages over very long timescales similar to 450 Myrs. The GCR model is combined with laboratory data from experiments in which dry methyl ices were irradiated to doses producing prebiotic amino acids such as glycine. The model calculations show glycine can form to similar to 2.5 ppb levels near the surface after similar to 450 Myrs of GCR proton irradiation and potentially to 5 ppb if heavy-ion GCRs up through Fe are included. If such molecules were detected, this would not only confirm this model but indicate that life forms different from ours may not be required.					; Cooper, John/D-4709-2012; Sittler, Edward/F-5613-2012	Sittler, Edward/0000-0002-1271-8357; 													0019-1035	1090-2643				JUL 1	2020	344								113246	10.1016/j.icarus.2019.03.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.03.023													WOS:000541929400001
J	Sinai, G; Jain, PK				Sinai, G; Jain, PK			Water management of irrigated-drained fields in the Jordan Valley South of Lake Kinneret	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												The Jordan Valley is one of the primary regions for growing winter crops of fruit and vegetables in Israel and Jordan. Control of water management in these fields is obtained by solid-set irrigation systems and subsurface drainage. Detailed field observations were conducted at a location near the Jordan River, south of Lake Kinneret. Water table heights were measured by approximately 100 piezometers. An exiting wide spacing (160 m) subsurface drainage system was monitored and the total drainage discharge from this regional drainage system to Lake Kinneret was measured. Rainfall, irrigation, and evapotranspiration rates were measured and overall hydrological balance was conducted. The old irrigation method in the region was border irrigation with very high leaching fraction and poor irrigation efficiency. During the 1970s the irrigation method was changed to computer operated drip. irrigation. The leaching fraction was reduced and irrigation efficiency increased. Reduction of the total drainage discharge to Lake Kinneret by a factor of about 10 was observed. Water table rise under hand moving sprinkler and soil-set drip irrigation methods were measured and compared for assessment of salinization of the root zone by upward movement of groundwater. The result indicates the strong effect of irrigation time interval on the extent of these rises. The effect of irrigation mode on the extent of water table rises was measured at the field by comparing that under hand moving sprinkler irrigation to that under water solid set drip method. This effect depends, among other variables, on the irrigation time interval, a fact which complicates prediction of water table rise under different irrigation practices. These field results support previous theoretical analysis by the writers and highlighted the interrelationship between irrigation practice and drainage design. The effect of water table drawdown towards the Jordan River was monitored and found to be about 4.6%. The strong influence of the Jordan River on water table height at the drained field is magnified by the existence of sandy layers in the soil profile. This observed gradient may be used for the estimation of lateral seepage flow from the irrigated agricultural field towards the adjacent Jordan River. This study provides a useful source of data for future studies in similar situations.

In this study, various survey and analysis studies on soil. water, sediment and animals from 1973 to 1999 were compared, temporal trends were analyzed, and the significance was discussed. In 1973. DDT, DDE. DDD, dieldrin. lindane and aldrin were the major organochlorine insecticides found at higher levels in rice paddy soil in Taiwan. In 1981, average total DDTs concentration of surface soil decreased to one-third of the 1973 level. Subsequently in 1994, total DDTs concentration in surface soil again decreased to one-third of the 1981 level. Dieldrin, lindane and aldrin concentrations decreased even faster and were much lower compared to DDT since 1981. Organochlorine insecticide mean concentrations in river water bad reached ppt levels from 1973-1976, hilt were rarely detected in the 1990s. River sediment concentrations showed a rapid decrease from 1973 to 1976, but although there were variations among different rivers in Taiwan, sediment concentrations of lindane. DDT, DDE and aldrin reached a few ppb and were higher in 1981 compared to 1973-1976 on average. In recent years, total organochlorine insecticide concentration decreased to the ppb level, with most individual insecticide concentrations below 1 ppb. Shellfish organochlorine pesticide concentrations were slightly higher than sediment, and shellfish DDT. DDE, aldrin, dieldrin concentrations also showed an increase from 1973 to 1983 on average. The mean concentrations of DDT and aldrin were higher than 10 ppb in shellfish in 1983 and decreased to below the ppb level in the 1990s. Fish muscle contained ppb levels of organochlorine insecticides in 1973. In recent years, most of the organochlorine insecticide concentrations in shellfish and fish were less than 1 ppb except DDE. Duck eggs and human milk had been found to contain sub ppm levels of DDT and DDE in the 1970s and 1980s, but there was few recent data available. Although organochlorine insecticide levels in the environment of Taiwan have fallen fast over the last 26 years. DDTs and other organochlorine insecticide residue levels in higher animals should be determined for their bioaccumulation potential through the food chain.																			1021-9498					SEP	2000	8	3					149	158																WOS:000089691600001
J	DEEVEY, ES; STUIVER, M				DEEVEY, ES; STUIVER, M			DISTRIBUTION OF NATURAL ISOTOPES OF CARBON IN LINSLEY-POND AND OTHER NEW-ENGLAND LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												One product of lake metabolism, the CO2 that is produced anaerobically, is naturally labeled by its high C13 content, but in the presence of carbonates, even the modest amounts found in medium-hard Linsley Pond, such enrichment is not distinctive. Groundwater near the lake is highly charged (175 ml/liter) with CO2; because its source includes ancient carbonate, it is naturally labeled as C14-poor (a = -87.5%O). Com-bining these data with estimates of surface inflow, outflow, and other gains and losses of water and carbon, we can account for the C14 deficiency observed in hypolimnetic water (A = ca. -100%o) by a ground-water contribution of the order of 1 liter/(m2 x day), perhaps less than 1% of the flow expected if the lake were not well insulated by a clay basin seal. Under ice, during the winter of 1961-62, C14 depletion of the deep water developed so rapidly as to suggest direct injection of groundwater and its accumulation by gravitational flow; however, groundwater carbon is ordinarily cycled metabolically, as shown by the fact that organic surface mud has an apparent age of ca. 1000 years (S C14 = -133%O). Inadequate knowledge of the hydrology of Linsley Pond interferes with rigorous description of the carbon balance, as does recent strong but irregular contamination of air by artificial (hydrogen-bomb) C14. By 1960, submerged pondweeds and surface waters of several lakes were enriched in artificial C14 by less than 5%, while water-lily leaves, which use atmospheric rather than aquatic sources of carbon, were enriched by ca. 22%. Using the enrichment of Linsley Pond, 1.9% per year, as a tracer, we find the invasion of atmospheric CO2 to be slow, ca. 1.2 moles/(m2 x yr) [1.4 mg/(cm2 x yr)]. Contributions from groundwater and from air being small, and metabolism being an internal cycle that is nearly closed, the carbon balance of a small lake is seen as part of the hydrologic cycle and as dominated by bicaronate in surface runoff.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1964	9	1					1	11		10.4319/lo.1964.9.1.0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1964.9.1.0001													WOS:A1964WU65800001
J	Lathrop, RC				Lathrop, Richard C.			Perspectives on the eutrophication of the Yahara lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT					25th International Symposium of the North-American-Lake-Management-Society	NOV, 2005	Madison, WI	N Amer Lake Management Soc				Eutrophication of the four Yahara lakes-Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa-near Madison, Wisconsin, has been dramatic since the mid-1800s. For Lake Mendota, the erosion of sediments from higher water levels established by the damming of the lake's outlet, plus the agricultural expansion of its watershed, resulted in blue-green algal growths. These impacts, however, were dwarfed by water quality problems stemming from Madison's wastewater inputs that directly entered Lake Monona from the late 1800s through 1936, and then Lake Waubesa until 1958. Blue-green algal blooms were so bad in the lower Yahara lakes that the Madison Public Health Department conducted major copper sulfate treatments during 1925-1954. During the wastewater input years, inorganic nitrogen (N) and especially dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations in the surface waters were very high (particularly in Waubesa and Kegonsa), indicating neither nutrient was limiting algal growth. No P legacy from the wastewater inputs was found in Waubesa and Kegonsa's sediments; minimal P-binding potential due to low iron (Fe) availability is the hypothesized reason. Mendota's algal blooms were not a problem until the mid-1940s when wastewater inputs from upstream communities increased as well as the agricultural use of N and P fertilizers. This increase in eutrophication symptoms coincided with an increase in indices of DRP and inorganic N concentrations in the lake. After wastewater diversion in 1971, blue-green algal blooms persisted in Lake Mendota, and the onus of the problem shifted to agricultural and urban nonpoint source pollution. While much progress has been made in recent years to control these pollution sources to Mendota, manure runoff during late winter continues as a management problem. As evidence, P loadings during January to March constituted 48% of total loadings measured for 1990-2006 in the Yahara. River subwatershed. Much of this runoff P was dissolved and not associated with high sediment loads, whereas during other months, more of the runoff P was bound to sediments that could settle out in lower stream reaches prior to entering the lake. However, low P-binding potential of recently deposited sediments in Mendota along with signs of water quality improvements following periods of drought indicate the take could respond rapidly to nutrient input reductions. Finally, DRP and inorganic N concentrations since 1980 have indicated that algal growth in the Yahara lakes during July-August may have been limited by not only P, but N (especially in the lower Yahara lakes). Aggressive programs to reduce inputs from both nutrients will be important to prevent scum-forming blue-green algal blooms and filamentous algal growths that could become problematic once zebra mussels become established in the Yahara lakes.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				DEC	2007	23	4					345	365		10.1080/07438140709354023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140709354023													WOS:000258162200004
J	PRISCU, JC				PRISCU, JC			PHYTOPLANKTON NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY IN LAKES OF THE MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS, ANTARCTICA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The influence of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment on phytoplankton photosynthesis was investigated in Lakes Bonney (east and west lobes), Hoare, Fryxell. and Vanda, which lie in the ablation valleys adjacent to McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Bioassay experiments were conducted during the austral summer on phytoplankton populations just beneath the permanent ice cover in all lakes and on populations forming deep-chlorophyll maxima in the east and west lobes of Lake Bonney. 2. Phytoplankton photosynthesis in surface and mid-depth (13 m) samples from both lobes of Lake Bonney were stimulated significantly (P < 0.01) by phosphorus enrichment (2 mu M) With further stimulation by simultaneous phosphorus plus NH4+ (20 mu M) enrichment. Similar trends were observed in deeper waters (18 m) from the east lobe of Lake Bonney, although they were not statistically significant at P < 0.05. Photosynthesis in this lake was never enhanced by the addition of 20 mu M NH4+ alone. Simultaneous addition of phosphorus plus nitrogen stimulated photosynthesis significantly (P < 0.01) in both Lake Hoare and Lake Fryxell. No nutrient response occurred in Lake Vanda, where activity in nutrient-enriched samples was below unamended controls; results from Lake Vanda are suspect owing to excessively long sample storage in the field resulting from logistic constraints. 3. Ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (NH4+ + NO2- NO3-): soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) ratios partially support results from bioassay experiments indicating strong phosphorus deficiency in Lake Bonney and nitrogen deficiency in Lakes Hoare and Fryxell. DIN:SRP ratios also imply phosphorus deficiency in Lake Vanda, although not as strong as in Lake Bonney. Particulate carbon (PC):particulate nitrogen (PN) ratios all exceed published ratios for balanced phytoplankton growth, indicative of nitrogen deficiency. 4. Vertical nutrient profiles in concert with low advective flux, indicate that new (sensu Dugdale & Goering, 1967) phytoplankton production in these lakes is supported by upward diffusion of nutrients from deep nutrient pools. This contention was tested by computing upward DIN:SRP flux ratios across horizontal planes located immediately beneath each chlorophyll maximum and about 2 m beneath the ice (to examine flux to the phytoplankton immediately below the ice cover). These flux ratios further corroborated nutrient bioassay results and bulk DIN: SRP ratios indicating phosphorus deficiency in Lakes Bonney and Vanda and potential nitrogen deficiency in Lakes Hoare and Fryxell. 5. Neither biochemical reactions nor physical processes appear to be responsible for differences in nutrient deficiency among the study lakes. The differences may instead be related to conditions which existed before or during the evolution of the lakes.																			0046-5070					OCT	1995	34	2					215	227		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00882.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00882.x													WOS:A1995TA71400002
J	Lennartson, GJ; Schwartz, MD				Lennartson, GJ; Schwartz, MD			The lake breeze-ground-level ozone connection in eastern Wisconsin: A climatological perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Lake Michigan Air Quality Region (LMAQR) experiences exceedances of the 1 h health standard for ozone numerous times each summer. Previous short-term investigations have revealed that the lake breeze circulation is connected with very high levels of ozone in eastern Wisconsin (EWI). Findings from one of the more recent short-term research efforts have led to the development of a generalized conceptual model that details the role that the lake breeze circulation plays in transporting ozone-rich air of the Lake Michigan conduction layer onshore to EWI. Short-term studies, however, are limited by the small number of cases examined. To understand the ozone-lake breeze relationship from a climatological perspective, we analysed the spatial and temporal pattern of 1 h ozone exceedances in EWI during the months of May through to September, over the period 1985-99. Further, we used Laird et al.'s recently developed technique for discriminating lake breeze days to determine which exceedance-days over the period of our climatology occurred in association with lake breezes. Our results show: (1) a decrease in both magnitude and frequency of exceedances of the 1 h ozone standard in EWI with increasing distance from the lakeshore; (2) a positive correlation between average onset time of the initial exceedance-hour and a site's distance from Lake Michigan; (3) a very high percentage of initial exceedance-hours occurring in association with southeasterly surface air flow; and (4) exceedances occurring in association with lake breezes 82.1% of the time at near-shore sites. Collectively, our findings provide strong evidence that the lake breeze circulation is closely associated with the distribution of ozone in EWI in both space and time. Moreover, our results show that the lake breeze circulation is directly associated with a significant proportion of the exceedances of the 1 h ozone standard in EWI-particularly at near-shore sites. Thus, mandated reductions in regional-scale NOx may be sufficient to allow 'inland' locations in EWI to meet the new 8 h, 80 ppb Environmental Protection Agency health standard. However, further reductions in volatile organic compounds and NOx within the major metropolitan centres of the LMAQR will likely be necessary if 'shoreline' locations in EWI are to meet the 1 h standard, and the stricter 8 h standard in the future.

Seston quality drives feeding, stoichiometry and excretion of zebra mussels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Seston availability and quality can affect the condition, nutrient stoichiometry and nutrient excretion of dreissenid mussels and other aquatic consumers. Nutrient excretion by dreissenid mussels may affect phytoplankton community composition by altering nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios of the water and may be an important accessory factor leading to increased Cladophora and toxic Microcystis blooms in mussel-invaded lakes. 2. We manipulated phosphorus enrichment levels [no (L), moderate (M) and high (H)] and zebra mussel concentrations (1,2 and 4 g dry mass m(-2)) to produce a total of nine treatment combinations, each one held in a 31 m(3) enclosure in an oligotrophic lake. We measured zebra mussel condition, carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) tissue stoichiometry, feeding rate and nutrient excretion and egestion as related to varying conditions of chlorophyll a (Chl), particulate phosphorus (PP), particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and seston C:N:P ratios at three time periods:5-7, 18-20 and 32-34 days subsequent of adding mussels to the enclosures. 3. Consistent with approximate homeostatic control of N and P, there were only modest differences in C:N:P ratios in mussel soft tissue despite greatly different seston C:N:P ratios among enrichment treatments. Mussel condition (mass per unit length) decreased with increased seston N:P, C:P and C:N ratios and percent composition of Cyanobacteria, and increased with percentage composition of cryptophytes and other flagellates. 4. Assimilation rates of Chl and calculated potential assimilation rates of N and P linearly increased (P < 0.05) with increasing seston Chl, PON and PP concentrations. 5. P excretion measured as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) significantly decreased in exponential fashion by two orders of magnitude as C:P (R-2 = 0.71) and N:P ratios (R-2 = 0.66) increased by a factor of 4. P excretion was significantly correlated with seston PP concentration, which varied over a 19-fold range; however, there was much scatter in the relationship (R-2 = 0.29). In contrast, NH4-N excretion significantly decreased (R-2 = 0.31) with N:P ratio by a factor of 2 over this same N:P range, and was not significantly correlated with PON concentration. Soluble P excretion was significantly correlated with potential P assimilation, whereas NH4 excretion was not significantly correlated with potential N assimilation. The ratio of N:P excreted showed a significant exponential increase with seston N:P ratio. 6. P and N egestion rates were higher than corresponding P and N excretion rates from the same trials; however, the fate of this egested material - whether recycled by resuspension or remaining in the benthos - is not known. 7. Mussel excretion and its impacts are highly context dependent, varying with algal composition, seston stoichiometry, and mussel abundance and feeding rate. The low P excretion but high N excretion observed when mussel feeding stops implies that under poor feeding conditions typical of summer seston, mussels excrete little P but continue excreting N, which would slow production rate of producers such as Cladophora and Microcystis in low-P systems. In contrast, NH4 excretion by mussels may prolong Microcystis blooms as nitrate is used up by the bloom in moderate-P systems.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2017	62	4					664	680		10.1111/fwb.12892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12892													WOS:000397947100003

Palaeohydrology of the Fazzan Basin and surrounding regions: The last 7 million years	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We have integrated information on topography, geology and geomorphology with the results of targeted fieldwork in order to develop a chronology for the development of Lake Megafazzan, a giant lake that has periodically existed in the Fazzan Basin since the late Miocene. The development of the basin can be best understood by considering the main geological and geomorphological events that occurred thought Libya during this period and thus an overview of the palaeohydrology of all Libya is also presented. The origin of the Fazzan Basin appears to lie in the Late Miocene. At this time Libya was dominated by two large rivers systems that flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, the Sahabi River draining central and eastern Libya and the Wadi Nashu River draining much of western Libya. As the Miocene progressed the region become increasingly affected by volcanic activity on its northern and eastern margin that appears to have blocked the River Nashu in Late Miocene or early Messinian times forming a sizeable closed basin in the Fazzan within which proto-Lake Megafazzan would have developed during humid periods. The fall in base level associated with the Messinian desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea promoted down-cutting and extension of river systems throughout much of Libya. To the south of the proto Fazzan Basin the Sahabi River tributary know as Wadi Barjuj appears to have expanded its headwaters westwards. The channel now terminates at Al Haruj al Aswad. We interpret this as a suggestion that Wadi Barjuj was blocked by the progressive development of Al Haruj al Aswad. K/Ar dating of lava flows suggests that this occurred between 4 and 2 Ma. This event would have increased the size of the closed basin in the Fazzan by about half, producing a catchment close to its current size (-350,000 km(2)). The Fazzan Basin contains a wealth of Pleistocene to recent palaeolake sediment outcrops and shorelines. Dating of these features demonstrates evidence of lacustrine conditions during numerous interglacials spanning a period greater than 420 ka. The middle to late Pleistocene interglacials were humid enough to produce a giant lake of about 135,000 km(2) that we have called Lake Megafazzan. Later lake phases were smaller, the interglacials less humid, developing lakes of a few thousand square kilometres. In parallel with these palaeohydrological developments in the Fazzan Basin, change was occurring in other parts of Libya. The Lower Pliocene sea level rise caused sediments to infill much of the Messinian channel system. As this was occurring, subsidence in the Al Kufrah Basin caused expansion of the Al Kufrah River system at the expense of the River Sahabi. By the Pleistocene, the Al Kufrah River dominated the palaeohydrology of eastern Libya and had developed a very large inland delta in its northern reaches that exhibited a complex distributary channel network which at times fed substantial lakes in the Sirt Basin. At this time Libya was a veritable lake district during humid periods with about 10% of the country underwater. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Structure, thermal expansion and incompressibility of MgSO4.9H2O, its relationship to meridianiite (MgSO4.11H2O) and possible natural occurrences	ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION B-STRUCTURAL SCIENCE CRYSTAL ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS												Since being discovered initially in mixed-cation systems, a method of forming end-member MgSO4.9H(2)O has been found. We have obtained powder diffraction data from protonated analogues (using X-rays) and deuterated analogues (using neutrons) of this compound over a range of temperatures and pressures. From these data we have determined the crystal structure, including all hydrogen positions, the thermal expansion over the range 9-260 K at ambient pressure, the incompressibility over the range 0-1.1 GPa at 240 K and studied the transitions to other stable and metastable phases. MgSO4.9D(2)O is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c, Z = 4, with unit-cell parameters at 9 K, a = 6.72764 (6), b = 11.91154 (9), c = 14.6424 (1) angstrom , beta = 95.2046 (7)degrees and V = 1168.55 (1) angstrom(3). The structure consists of two symmetry-inequivalent Mg(D2O)(6) octahedra on sites of (1) over bar symmetry. These are directly joined by a water-water hydrogen bond to form chains of octahedra parallel with the b axis at a = 0. Three interstitial water molecules bridge the Mg(D2O)(6) octahedra to the SO42- tetrahedral oxyanion. These tetrahedra sit at a similar or equal to 0.5 and are linked by two of the three interstitial water molecules in a pentagonal motif to form ribbons parallel with b. The temperature dependences of the lattice parameters from 9 to 260 K have been fitted with a modified Einstein oscillator model, which was used to obtain the coefficients of the thermal expansion tensor. The volume thermal expansion coefficient, alpha(V), is substantially larger than that of either MgSO4.7D(2)O (epsomite) or MgSO4.11D(2)O (meridianiite), being similar to 110 x 10(-6) K-1 at 240 K. Fitting to a Murnaghan integrated linear equation of state gave a zero-pressure bulk modulus for MgSO4.9D(2)O at 240 K, K-0 = 19.5 (3) GPa, with the first pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, K-0 = 3.8 (4). The bulk modulus is virtually identical to meridianiite and only similar to 14% smaller than that of epsomite. Above similar to 1 GPa at 240 K the bulk modulus begins to decrease with pressure; this elastic softening may indicate a phase transition at a pressure above similar to 2 GPa. Synthesis of MgSO4.9H(2)O from cation-pure aqueous solutions requires quench-freezing of small droplets, a situation that may be relevant to spraying of MgSO4-rich cryomagmas into the surface environments of icy satellites in the outer solar system. However, serendipitously, we obtained a mixture of MgSO(4.)9H(2)O, mirabilite (Na2SO4.10H(2)O) and ice by simply leaving a bottle of mid-winter brine from Spotted Lake (Mg/Na ratio = 3), British Columbia, in a domestic freezer for a few hours. This suggests that MgSO4.9H(2)O can occur naturally - albeit on a transient basis - in certain terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments.

J	Thevenon, F; Williamson, D; Bard, E; Anselmetti, FS; Beaufort, L; Cachier, H				Thevenon, Florian; Williamson, David; Bard, Edouard; Anselmetti, Flavio S.; Beaufort, Luc; Cachier, Helene			Combining charcoal and elemental black carbon analysis in sedimentary archives: Implications for past fire regimes, the pyrogenic carbon cycle, and the human-climate interactions	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												This paper addresses the quantification of combustion-derived products in oceanic and continental sediments by optical and chemical approaches, and the interest of combining such methods for reconstructing past biomass burning activity and the pyrogenic carbon cycle. In such context, the dark particles >0.2 mu m(2) remaining after the partial digestion of organic matter are optically counted by automated image analysis and defined as charcoal, while the elemental carbon remaining after thermal and chemical oxidative treatments is quantified as black carbon (BC). The obtained pyrogenic carbon records from three sediment core-based case studies, (i) the Late Pleistocene equatorial Pacific Ocean. (ii) the mid-Holocene European Lake Lucerne, and (iii) the Late Holocene African Lake Masoko, are interpreted as proxy records of regional transportation mechanisms and biomass burning activities. The results show that the burial of dark carbon-rich particles in the 360 kyr-long record from the west equatorial Pacific is controlled by the combination of sea-level changes and low-latitude atmospheric circulation patterns (summer monsoon dynamics). However, the three fold increases in charcoal and BC sediment influxes between 53-43 and 12-10 kyr BP suggest that major shifts in fire activity occur synchronously with human colonization in the Indo/Pacific region. The coarse charcoal distribution from a 7.2 kyr record from Lake Lucerne in Switzerland closely matches the regional timing of major technical, land-use, and socio-economic changes during the Neolithic (between ca. 5.7 and 5.2 kyr BP and 4.9-4.5 kyr BP), the Bronze and Iron Ages (at ca. 3.3 and 2.4 kyr BP, respectively), and the industrialization (after AD 1838), pointing to the key impact of human activities on the sources, transportation processes and reservoirs of refractory carbon during the Holocene. In the tropical Masoko maar lake in Tanzania, where charcoal and BC records are highly sensitive to the local climate and environment, surface runoffs from forested areas and/or aerial transportation over short distances are also important sources for detrital charred particles. However, this 4.3 kyr-long record exhibits a major increase in charcoal and BC sediment influxes between 1.8 and 0.6 kyr BP, synchronously with the regional extent of Late Iron Age and agricultural innovations. Therefore, in both marine and terrestrial depositional environments, the climate- and vegetation-controlled fire regimes appear to be strongly associated to societal changes, or directly affected by human practices. In fact, the anthropogenic effect associated to past human activities (e.g. settlement, agriculture, and metallurgy) has temporarily at least tripled the emissions of pyrogenic carbon in the environment. However, the data from the three Late Pleistocene to Holocene sequences also show that the redistribution of fossil particles by runoff and erosion processes is a significant source of pyrogenic carbon that should be understood as a prerequisite for interpreting sedimentary records of biomass burning.

J	De Carlo, EH; Green, WJ				De Carlo, EH; Green, WJ			Rare earth elements in the water column of Lake Vanda, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We present data on the composition of water from Lake Vanda, Antarctica. Vanda and other lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are characterized by closed basins, permanent ice covers, and deep saline waters. The meromictic lakes provide model systems for the study of trace metal cycling owing to their pristine nature and the relative simplicity of their biogeochemical systems. Lake Vanda, in the Wright Valley, is supplied by a single input, the Onyx River, and has no output. Water input to the lake is balanced by sublimation of the nearly permanent ice cap that is broken only near the shoreline during the austral summer. The water column is characterized by an inverse thermal stratification of anoxic warm hypersaline water underlying cold oxic freshwater. Water collected under trace-element clean conditions was analyzed for its dissolved and total rare earth element (REE) concentrations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Depth profile, are characterized by low dissolved REE concentrations (La, Ce, < 15 pM) in surface waters that increase slightly (La, 70 pM; Ce, 20 pM) with increasing depth to similar to 55 m, the limit of the fresh oxic waters. Below this depth, a sharp increase in the concentrations of strictly trivalent REE (e.g., La, 5 nM) is observed, and a submaximum in redox sensitive Ce (2.6 nM) is found at 60- to 62-m depth. At a slightly deeper depth, a sharper Ce maximum is observed with concentrations exceeding 11 nM at a 67-m depth, immediately above the anoxic zone. The aquatic concentrations of REE reported here are similar to 50-fold higher than previously reported for marine oxic/anoxic boundaries and are, to our knowledge, the highest ever observed at natural oxic/anoxic interfaces. REE maxima occur within stable and warm saline waters. All REE concentrations decrease sharply in the sulfidic bottom waters. The redox-cline in Lake Vanda is dominated by diffusional processes and vertical transport of dissolved species driven by concentration gradients. Furthermore, because the ultraoligotrophic nature of the lake limits the potential for organic phases to act as metal carriers, metal oxide coatings and sulfide phases appear to largely govern the distribution of trace elements. We discuss REE cycling in relation to the roles of redox reactions and competitive scavenging onto Mn- and Fe-oxides coatings on clay sized particles in the upper oxic water column and their release by reductive dissolution near the anoxic/oxic interface.

The spectacularly preserved and shale-rich Chuar Group of the Grand Canyon Supergroup stands out as one of the best global records of this time period, particularly for paleobiology. A new U-Pb age of 782 Ma on detrital zircons (n = 14 young grains) from the underlying Nankoweap Formation refines the Chuar Group's maximum depositional age to younger than 782 Ma. A new 40Ar/39Ar age of 764 +/- 16 Ma (2 sigma) from K-feldspar within early diagenetic marcasite nodules from the upper Chuar Group (Awatubi Member) helps calibrate the rich Chuar microfossil record and constrain the large-magnitude shift in delta C-13(org) (up to 18 parts per thousand; referred to here as the Awatubi positive carbon- isotope excursion or APCIE) to between ca. 764 and ca. 742 Ma, the date of an ash near the top of the Chuar Group. In addition to the maximum depositional age of ca. 782 Ma, U-Pb detrital zircon analyses (n = 826 grains) on sandstone beds from the underlying Nankoweap Formation indicate the presence of multiple older Lauren-tian age peaks. The similarity of detrital zircon populations and sedimentary character to that of the overlying Chuar Group (n = 764 grains) suggests that the Nankoweap Formation should be included as the lowermost unit in the Chuar Group. This revised geo-chrono-logical framework indicates a 300 Ma unconformity between the Chuar Group (including the Nankoweap Formation) and the underlying 1.1 Ga Cardenas Basalt of the Unkar Group. Chuar Group detrital zircon populations share similarities with those of the Uinta Mountain Group and especially the -middle Pahrump Group, including ca. 780 Ma grains. Biostratigraphic correlation using micro-fossils enhances the ChUMP connection and shows a trend of higher acritarch diversity in the lower Chuar and Uinta Mountain groups, and the presence of vase-shaped microfossils in the upper intervals of all three ChUMP units. Comparisons of delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb) among ChUMP successions suggest a combination of local and regional controls. Thus, ChUMP successions are coeval within the 780-740 Ma range, show similar fossil and C-isotope trends, and derived sediments from similar Laurentian sources or source types. In light of recent age constraints and compiled paleontology in other Neoproterozoic basins, our high-resolution correlation of ChUMP successions can be extended to the Callison Lake dolostone of NW Canada and the Akademikerbreen-Polarisbreen groups of Svalbard. Biostratigraphic correlation with poorly age-constrained strata such as the Akademikerbreen-Polarisbreen groups and, farther afield, the Visingso Group of Baltica suggests that ChUMP units record continentwide-and perhaps global-evolutionary patterns. The delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb) values in the Chuar Group and its equivalents in Canada and Svalbard show broadly similar trends, including the APCIE, suggesting that delta C-13(org) values from organic-rich shale record variations in the C-isotope composition of late Tonian oceans. Intracratonic basins and contiguous rift margins of ChUMP age are inferred to have been important locations for microbial productivity and significant organic carbon burial that induced large positive shifts in delta C-13 and changes in global carbon balance prior to the onset of snowball Earth.

In 1994 and 1995, a 162-ha portion of Grayson Lake was fertilized with a liquid high-nitrogen fertilizer. In 1995, the high-nitrogen fertilizer was supplemented with a small amount of a liquid high-phosphorus fertilizer. The area fertilized in 1996 and 1997 was reduced to a 41-ha embayment originally in the area fertilized in 1994 and 1995, and the fertilizer was changed to a liquid high-phosphorus fertilizer. No major changes in the quantities of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), or chlorophyll a occurred in the fertilized portion in 1994 or 1995. Bottom-up effects were detected after application of the high-phosphorus fertilizer in 1996 and 1997. Increases in SRP occurred in the fertilized portion of the reservoir in 1996, but because of hydraulic flushing, chlorophyll a did not increase, In 1997, however, both SRP and chlorophyll a increased in the fertilized area. Zooplankton did not increase in the fertilized area of the reservoir in either 1996 or 1997. Possible middle-out effects may have suppressed Cladocera and copepod densities in the fertilized area after application of the high-phosphorus fertilizer. The middle-out effects were primarily caused by increases in stock densities (catch per unit effort; CPUE) of age-0 gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, but increased densities of age-0 largemouth bass and possibly other species in the fertilized area may have contributed to reduced zooplankton densities in the fertilized area in 1997. Increased densities of age-0 largemouth bass did not result in detectable increases in CPUE of age-1 largemouth bass in the fertilized area. No increases in the fall mean length or CPUE of age-0 largemouth bass at least 127 mm long were found in the fertilized portion of the reservoir that could be attributed to the fertilization program. Artificial fertilization of a large warmwater reservoir to increase largemouth bass populations appears to be cost-prohibitive and has limited management applications, particularly in reservoirs with low water retention rates and possibly those having a gizzard shad population.																			0275-5947					MAY	2001	21	2					393	403		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0393:RTAFAG>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0393:RTAFAG>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289100014

Delineating the origin of migratory Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) in Indiana using stable isotope analysis	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) is a highly migratory owl that occurs throughout North America. Banding stations have studied the migratory habits of this species, but these studies rarely collect significant data regarding the origin of migrant birds captured in the midwestern United States. In the last 20 years Northern Saw-whet Owl ecology has been studied broadly; however, little is known how different populations may interact with one another. Many avian species with large geographic ranges often have populations that breed and winter in separate areas. Little has been documented to establish if this pattern exists in Northern Saw-whet Owls, a species where individuals are migratory, sedentary, and nomadic. Stable isotope ratios using deuterium delta 2H in feathers have been successfully used to estimate the breeding origin of birds. We used stable isotope analysis of delta 2H in conjunction with an isoscape map to determine breeding origins for Indiana Northern Saw-whet Owls. We collected 41 feather samples from migrating owls at 6 different banding sites across Indiana from October to November 2017. Because higher enrichment values in adult owl feathers complicate analysis, we only analyzed samples from young (hatching-year) individuals. After analysis and exclusion of birds identified as outliers, the model suggested that the birds originated along 44 degrees N around the Great Lakes Region and as far east as Nova Scotia, Canada. When including outliers, the model suggested that individuals originated along 40 degrees N between Iowa and New York. The outliers-excluded model remained more consistent with the known breeding range of this species than the outliers-included model. We successfully used this technique and our data suggests that the majority of Northern Saw-whet Owls originated from the Great Lakes Region. We recommend further investigation on the physiology and behavior of owls on the breeding grounds, which could aid in the ability to better understand differences in delta 2H enrichment of this species. Better understanding of this would allow these models to be plotted more precisely onto the landscape.

Se ha documentado poco para establecer si este patr & oacute;n existe en este mochuelo, y donde sus individuos son migratorios, sedentarios y n & oacute;madas. En el pasado, se ha usado exitosamente la proporci & oacute;n de is & oacute;topos estables de deuterio delta 2H en plumas para estimar el origen reproductivo de estas aves. Usamos el an & aacute;lisis de is & oacute;topos estables de delta 2H de manera conjunta con un mapa de su isopaisaje para determinar los or & iacute;genes reproductivos de los mochuelos de Indiana. Colectamos 41 muestras de plumas de estos mochuelos en 6 diferentes sitios de anillado a lo ancho de indiana de octubre a noviembre de 2017. Debido a que los valores enriquecidos de las plumas de los adultos complican los an & aacute;lisis, & uacute;nicamente examinamos plumas de individuos juveniles (nacidos en ese a & ntilde;o). Despu & eacute;s de los an & aacute;lisis y la exclusi & oacute;n de aves identificadas como valores at & iacute;picos, el modelo sugiere que estas aves se originan a una latitud de 44 degrees N, alrededor de la regi & oacute;n de los Grandes Lagos y en su extremo este hasta Nova Scotia, Canad & aacute;.

J	NISSENBAUM, A				NISSENBAUM, A			SODOM, GOMORRAH AND THE OTHER LOST CITIES OF THE PLAIN - A CLIMATIC PERSPECTIVE	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Certain aspects of the biblical story of the Cities of the Plain have in recent years become widely accepted. Among them is the placing of those cities in the southern basin of the Dead Sea, the assumption that those cities are now covered by Dead Sea water and, in particular, the belief that their destruction was due to catastrophic geological causes, such as an earthquake. The Bible emphasizes the agricultural richness of the Jordan plain prior to the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah and its catastrophic transformation into a wasteland. Thus, stripped of ethical and religious overtones, the scenario is that of a rapid climatic change that converted a densely inhabited and richly watered area into an infertile salt playa. The region northeast and southeast of Jericho, which today is quite barren as a result of the upward movement of salty ground water but which contains some of the World's earliest known agricultural settlements, fits such a picture. Dating the Sodom event to approximately the 2 3rd-21 st centuries B.C. supports the idea that a major climatic change that occurred between the Early and Middle Bronze Ages and which resulted in profound transformations in the Middle East such as the collapse of the Ancient Kingdom of Egypt, the invasion of the Fertile Crescent by the Semitic desert nomads, and the collapse of Early Bronze Age civilization in Palestine - is also responsible for the Sodom story. Although the data are far from complete, desiccation during this period is indicated by palynological evidence pointing to the decimation of forests in Northern Israel, paleobotanical evidence from Southern Israel, the deposition of salt layers in the Dead Sea, the abandonment of almost all settlements in the Negev Desert of Southern Israel, the Jordan valley and Southern Jordan, except those which were associated with perennial springs, and further afield the drastic lowering of the level of Lake Moeris in Lower Egypt. This scenario does not exclude the possibility that a major earthquake - which may have occurred during this period - was considered to be the cause of the final physical destruction of the Cities of the Plain, delivering a coup de grace to a collapsing society, and which became through the mists of time and legend, the only agent of destruction.																			0165-0009					APR	1994	26	4					435	446		10.1007/BF01094406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01094406													WOS:A1994NQ96000006

The Last Glacial Maximum at 44°S documented by a 10Be moraine chronology at Lake Ohau, Southern Alps of New Zealand	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Determining whether glaciers registered the classic Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 26,500-similar to 19,000 yrs ago) coevally between the hemispheres can help to discriminate among hypothesized drivers of ice-age climate. Here, we present a record of glacier behavior from the Southern Alps of New Zealand during the 'local LGM' (LLGM). We used Be-10 surface-exposure dating methods and detailed glacial geomorphologic mapping to produce a robust chronology of well-preserved terminal moraines deposited during the LLGM near Lake Ohau on central South Island. We then used a glaciological model to estimate a LLGM glacier snowline and atmospheric temperature from the Ohau glacier record. Seventy-three Be-10 surface-exposure ages place culminations of terminal moraine construction, and hence completions of glacier advances to positions outboard of present-day Lake Ohau, at 138,600 +/- 10,600 yrs, 32,520 +/- 970 yrs ago, 27,400 +/- 1300 yrs ago, 22,510 +/- 660 yrs ago, and 18,220 +/- 500 yrs ago. Recessional moraines document glacier recession into the Lake Ohau trough by 17,690 +/- 350 yrs ago. Exposure of an ice-molded bedrock bench located inboard of the innermost LLGM moraines by 17,380 +/- 510 yrs ago indicates that the ice tongue had receded about 40% of its overall length by that time. Comparing our chronology with distances of retreat suggests that the Ohau glacier terminus receded at a mean net rate of about 77 m yr(-1) and its surface lowered by 200 m between 17,690 and 17,380 yrs ago. A long-term continuation of ice retreat in the Ohau glacier catchment is implied by moraine records at the head of Irishman Stream valley, a tributary of the Ohau glacier valley. The Irishman Stream cirque glacier advanced to produce a set of Lateglacial moraines at 13,000 +/- 500 yrs ago, implying that the cirque glacier was less extensive prior to that advance. We employed a glaciological model, fit to these mapped and dated LLGM moraines, to derive snowline elevations and temperature parameters from the Ohau glacier record. The modeling experiments indicate that a snowline lowering of 920 +/- 50 m and temperature depression of 6.25 +/- 0.5 degrees C below modern values allows for the Ohau glacier to grow to an equilibrium position within the LGM moraine belt Taken together with a glaciological simulation reported from the Irishman Stream valley, snowlines and temperatures increased by at least similar to 520 m and similar to 3.6 degrees C, respectively, between similar to 18,000 and similar to 13,000 yrs ago. Climate parameters derived from the Ohau glacier reconstruction are similar to those derived from glacier records from Patagonia, to air temperature indicators from Antarctica, as well as to sea-surface temperature and stratification signatures of the Southern Ocean. We think that the best explanation for the observed southern LLGM is that southern winter duration modulated Southern Ocean sea ice, which in turn influenced Southern Ocean stratification and made the surface ocean cooler. Orbitally induced cooling of the Southern Ocean provides an explanation for the LLGM in the Southern Alps having been coincident with the northern LGM. We argue further that the global effect of North Atlantic stadials led to disturbance of Southern Ocean stratification, southward shifts of the subtropical front, and retreat of Southern Alps glaciers. Collapse of Southern Ocean stratification during Heinrich Stadial-1, along with attendant sea-surface warming, triggered the onset of the Last Glacial termination in the Southern Alps of New Zealand.

J	XIANG, YC; BOWLER, JM; MAGEE, JW				XIANG, YC; BOWLER, JM; MAGEE, JW			GYPSUM GROUND - A NEW OCCURRENCE OF GYPSUM SEDIMENT IN PLAYAS OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												There are many playas (dry salt lakes) in arid central Australia (regional rainfall about 250 mm/y and pan evaporation around 3000 mm/y). Highly soluble salts, such as halite, only appear as a thin (several centimetres thick), white, ephemeral efflorescent crust on the dry surface. Gypsum is the major evaporite precipitating both at present and preserved in sediment sequences. One type of gypsum deposit forms a distinctive surface feature, which is here termed "gypsum ground". It consists of a thick (up to 80 cm) gypsum zone which rises from the surrounding smooth white playa surface and is overlain by a heaved brown crust. The gypsum zone, with an average gypsum content above 60%, consists of pure gypsum sublayers and interlayered clastic bands of sandy clay. The gypsum crystals are highly corroded, especially in the direction parallel to the c-axis and on the upper sides where illuviated clay has accumulated in corrosion hollows. Overgrowth parallel to the a- and b-axes is very common, forming highly discoidal habits. These secondary changes (corrosion and overgrowth) are well-developed in the vadose zone and absent from crystals below the long-term watertable (depth around 40 cm). These crystal characteristics indicate a rainwater leaching process. At Lake Amadeus, one of the largest playas (800 km2) of central Australia, such gypsum ground occupies 16% of the total area. The gypsum ground is interpreted as an alteration of a pre-existing gypsum deposit which probably extended across the whole playa before breaking down, leaving a playa marginal terrace and several terrace islands within the gypsum ground. This pre-existing gypsum deposit, preserved in the residual islands, consists of pure, pale, sand-sized lenticular crystals. It is believed to have been deposited during an episode of high regional watertable, causing active groundwater seepage and more frequent surface brine in the playa. A later fall in watertable, probably resulting from climatic change, caused the degradation of the gypsum deposit by dissolution and leaching processes. The common distribution of the gypsum ground and marginal terraces in the playas of central Australia demonstrates the extent of this hydrologic and climatic history.																			0037-0738					JUN	1991	72	1-2					79	95																WOS:A1991FZ17500004
J	Wood, CM; Walsh, PJ; Chew, SF; Ip, YK				Wood, CM; Walsh, PJ; Chew, SF; Ip, YK			Greatly elevated urea excretion after air exposure appears to be carrier mediated in the slender lungfish (Protopterus dolloi)	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Under aquatic conditions, Protopterus dolloi is ammoniotelic, excreting only small amounts of urea-N. However, upon return to water after 30 d estivation in air, the lungfish excretes only small amounts of ammonia-N but massive amounts of urea-N. A similar pattern is seen after 21-30 d of terrestrialization, a treatment in which the lungfish is air exposed but kept moist throughout. After both treatments, the time course of urea-N excretion is biphasic with an immediate increase, then a fall, and finally a second larger increase that peaks at about 12 h and may be prolonged for several days thereafter. Urea-N excretion rates during the second peak reach 2,000-6,000 mu mol N kg(-1) h(-1), two to three orders of magnitude greater than rates in most fish and comparable only to rates in species known to employ UT-A type facilitated diffusion urea transporters. Divided chamber studies and measurements of the clearance rates of [H-3]-PEG-4000 (a glomerular filtration and paracellular diffusion marker) and two structural analogs of urea ([C-14]-acetamide and [C-14]-thiourea) were performed to characterize the two peaks of urea-N excretion. The smaller first peak was almost equally partitioned between the head ( including internal and external gills) and the body compartment (including urinary opening), was accompanied by only a modest increase in [C-14]-acetamide clearance equal to that in [C-14]-thiourea clearance, and could be accounted for by a large but short-lasting increase in [H-3]-PEG-4000 clearance (to about fivefold the terrestrial rate). The delayed, much larger second peak in urea-N excretion represented an elevated efflux into both compartments but occurred mainly (72%) via the body rather than the head region. This second peak was accompanied by a substantial increase in [C-14]-acetamide clearance but only a modest further rise in [C-14]-thiourea clearance. The acetamide to thiourea permeability ratio was typical of UT-A type transporters in other fish. [H-3]-PEG-4000 clearance was stable at this time at about double the terrestrial rate, and excretion rates of urea and its analogs were many fold greater than could be accounted for by [H-3]-PEG-4000 clearance. We conclude that the first peak may be explained by elevated urinary excretion and paracellular diffusion across the gills upon resubmergence, while the second peak is attributable to a delayed and prolonged activation of a UT-A type facilitated diffusion mechanism, primarily in the skin and perhaps also in branchial epithelia.					; Wood, Chris/C-3021-2009; Ip, Yuen Kwong/H-8041-2012; Ip, Yuen/H-8041-2012; Chew, Shit/I-2248-2012	Chew, Shit Fun/0000-0003-4599-5817; Ip, Yuen Kwong/0000-0001-9124-7911; Wood, Chris/0000-0002-9542-2219; 													1522-2152	1537-5293				NOV-DEC	2005	78	6					893	907		10.1086/432919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/432919								16228929					WOS:000232832800003

In addition, these catfish have a protracted spawning period. The peak spawning time coincides with cultured channel catfish, but a percentage of the population spawns throughout the summer months. These fish are harvested at a small size and support an important but contentious commercial fishery. The small size and early age at sexual maturity have raised several questions: are these channel catfish, a distinct subspecies, or a hybrid between channel catfish and another ictalurid? These reproductive characteristics would prove useful for research, especially if the taxonomic uncertainty could be resolved. In this study, we differentiated these catfish by fin shape and external coloration from all other ictalurids present in Lake Maurepas except for channel catfish and blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus). Blue catfish were differentiated by the absence of spots, anal fin shape and anal fin ray count. Genome size (cellular DNA content) determined for Lake Maurepas catfish in this study (2.11 +/- 0.01 pg; N = 36) agreed with values for the Kansas strain of channel catfish (2.11 +/- 0.01 pg; N = 15). Staining of chromosomes to determine the location (chromosome pair) of the nucleolar organizing region (NOR) revealed that the NOR for Lake Maurepas catfish did not differ from that of channel catfish. In addition, NOR for hybrids of Lake Maurepas catfish x blue catfish were located on heteromorphic chromosomes. A segment of an immunoglobin gene was sequenced from channel catfish, Lake Maurepas catfish, blue catfish, and black bullhead (Ictalurus melas). The nucleotide sequences for channel catfish and Lake Maurepas catfish were identical, while differences were found among the other catfishes. These data indicate the existence of a distinct population of channel catfish in Lake Maurepas that possesses traits useful for research.																									2001							223	234																WOS:000184053000021

This study aimed to compare atopy, bronchial hyperreactivity, and reported symptoms of asthma in the power station town and a second control area with greater socioeconomic similarity. Design-A cross sectional survey was undertaken. Settings-Lake Munmorah, a coastal town near two power stations, and Dungog, a country town in the Hunter Valley, NSW, Australia Participants-All children attending kindergarten to year 6 at all schools in the two towns were invited to participate in 1990. The response rates for the questionnaire for reported symptoms and associated demographic data were 92% in Lake Munmorah and 93% in Dungog, with 84% and 90% of children respectively being measured for lung function, atopy, and bronchial reactivity. There were 419 boys and 432 girls aged 5 to 12 years. Measurements and main results-Main outcome measures were current wheeze and bronchial hyper-reactivity, defined as a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) of 20% or more. Current wheeze was reported in 24.8% of the Lake Munmorah children compared with 14.6% of the Dungog children. Bronchial hyper-reactivity was similar for both groups-25.2% in Lake Munmorah and 22.3% in Dungog. The mean baseline FEV1 was lower in Lake Munmorah than in Dungog (p<0.001). Dungog children were more likely to have positive skin test to house dust mite (Dungog 27.0%, Lake Munmorah 20.2%, p=0.028) but there were no other differences in skin test atopy in the two towns. After adjusting for age, gender, any smoker in the house, and positive dust mite skin test, the odds of current wheeze in Lake Munmorah compared with Dungog was 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.45, 3.15). Conclusions-Baseline lung function was lower and reported symptoms of asthma were higher in the power station town, but bronchial hyper-reactivity and skin test defined atopy were similar in the two communities. These results are consistent with the previous study and confirm the increased presence of reported symptomatic illness in the town near power stations.																			0143-005X					AUG	1993	47	4					282	286		10.1136/jech.47.4.282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.47.4.282								8228762					WOS:A1993LT07400007

Halophilic bacteria of salt lakes and saline soils of the Peri-Caspian lowland (Republic of Daghestan) and their biotechnological potential	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII												The article presents the results of studying the biodiversity and biotechnological potential of halophilic microorganisms from the thermal highly mineralized Berikey Lake, the salty Lake Tarumovskoye and saline soils of the Peri-Caspian Lowland (Republic of Daghestan). Denitrifying halophilic bacteria of the genus Halomonas and Virgibacillus were identified using microbiological methods and 16S rRNA gene analysis. A new species Halomonas sp. G2 (MW386470) with a similarity of the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes is 95 %. Strain G2 is an extreme halophile capable of growing in the range of 5-25 % NaCl (optimum 25 %) and forming a carotenoid pigment. Mesophil, 30-37 degrees C. (optimum 30 degrees C.); neutrophil, pH 6-8 (optimum 7.2-7.4). Strain G2 chemolithotroph; reduces nitrate or nitrite as electron donors; catalase-, amylase-, protease- and beta-galactosidase-positive; lipase-, oxidase- and urease-negative. Not able to hydrolyze inositol, indole; produces lysine, gelatin, ectoine; uses citrate and sodium malate as a source of carbon and energy; does not produce ornitin, H2S or acid from d-mannose, sucrose, glycerol, cellobiose, except for lactose and d-glucose. Susceptible to trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, kanamycin, vancomycin, rifampicin, cefuroxime, ampicillin, ceftazidime, fosfomycin, clarithromycin, cefepime, cefaclor. The G+C content in DNA is 67.3 %. A distinctive characteristic of the isolate was the production of industrially significant hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase, protease, beta-galactosidase, and oxidoreductase (catalase) at a NaCl concentration of 25 % in the medium. Habitat: saline soils on the territory of the Tersko-Kumskaya lowland (Republic of Daghestan, Russia). The rest of the halophilic isolates of H. ventosae G1 (MW386469), H. elongata G3 (MW386471), V. salinarius B2 (MW386472), and V. salinarius B3 (MW386473) had a high degree of similarity (100 %) with the type strains of H. elongata DSM 2581(T) and V. salarius DSM 18441(T); the content of G+C in DNA was 65.8, 66.5, 42.8 and 37.3 %, respectively. The strains had a high biotechnological potential at NaCl concentrations of 5 and 25 % in the medium. The data obtained expanded the understanding of the diversity and ecological significance of denitrifying bacteria in the functioning of arid ecosystems and make it possible to identify strains producing enzymes of industrial importance.

J	Ebert, SW; Rye, RO				Ebert, SW; Rye, RO			Secondary precious metal enrichment by steam-heated fluids in the Crofoot-Lewis hot spring gold-silver deposit and relation to paleoclimate	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												The Crofoot-Lewis deposit is an adularia-sericite-type (low-sulfidation) epithermal Au-Ag deposit, whose well-preserved paleosurface includes abundant opaline sinters, widespread and intense silicification, bedded hydrothermal eruption breccias, and a large zone of acid sulfate alteration. Radiogenic isotope ages indicate that the system was relatively long-lived, with hydrothermal activity starting around 4 Ma and extending, at least intermittently, for the next 3 m.y. Field evidence indicates that the surficial zone of acid sulfate alteration formed in a steam-heated environment within an active geothermal system. A drop in the water table enabled descending acid sulfate waters to leach Au and Ag from zones of low-grade disseminated mineralization, resulting in the redistribution and concentration of Au and Ag into ore-grade concentrations. These zones of secondary Au-Ag enrichment are associated with opal + alunite + kaolinite + montmorillonite +/- hematite and were deposited in open space fractures at, and within a few tens of meters below the paleowater table. The stable isotope systematics of alunite and kaolinite in the steam-heated environment are relatively complex, due to variations in the residence time of aqueous SO4 that formed from the oxidation of H2S prior to precipitation of alunite, and the susceptibility of fine-grained kaolinites to hydrogen isotope exchange with later waters. Most of the alunites are enriched in S-34 relative to early sulfide minerals, reflecting partial S isotope exchange between aqueous SO4 and H2S. About half of the alunites give reasonable calculated Delta(18)O(SO4-OH) temperatures for a steam-heated environment indicating O isotope equilibrium between aqueous SO4 and water. The delta D-H2O values of the hydrothermal fluids varied by almost 60 per mil over the life of the meteoric water-dominated system, suggesting significant climate changes. Mineralization is believed to have resulted from large-scale convection of meteoric water controlled largely by basin and range fractures and a high geothermal gradient with H2S for Au complexing derived from organic matter in basin sediments. A wet climate resulted in the formation of a large inland lake which provided abundant recharge water for the hydrothermal system. A fluctuating water table controlled by changing climatic conditions enabled steam-heated acid sulfate fluids to overprint lower grade mineralization resulting in ore-grade precious metal enrichment.																			0361-0128					AUG	1997	92	5					578	600		10.2113/gsecongeo.92.5.578	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.92.5.578													WOS:A1997YB51300005
J	Rakocevic-Nedovic, J; Hollert, H				Rakocevic-Nedovic, J; Hollert, H			Phytoplankton community and chlorophyll a as trophic state indices of Lake Skadar (Montenegro, Balkan)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH					8th Conference on New Blood in Ecotoxicology	SEP 21-23, 2003	Heidelberg, GERMANY	SETAC-GLB				Background, Aims and Scope. Phytoplankton, as a first step in trophic cascades of lakes, can be a good indicator of trophic states, considering that every environmental change affects this community and many species of this community are sensitive to changes, and that they response very quickly. In this study, we tried to assess and predict the trophic state of Lake Skadar according to phytoplankton data. Methods. Water samples were collected using Ruttner sampling bottle. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, ph, conductivity and transparence were measured in situ using portable equipment. Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured using standard spectrophotometric methods. A determination of phytoplankton species was performed using relevant keys and the counting of cells was performed using sedimentation methods. Results and Discussion. The species composition of Lake Skadar revealed 95 taxa, with Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae being represented best. According to an average chlorophyll a concentration of 5.9 mu g/l, Lake Skadar belongs to the mesotrophic level of the trophic scale. Developed prediction equation for chlorophyll a revealed a good prediction (R-2=0.71) and the parameter Secchi depth was primarily correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. Trophic state indices derived from chlorophyll a and transparency, were close together, but both were below the phosphorous index. Values of trophic state indices rank the Lake Skadar as being mesotrophic. This study also showed that indices of diversity based on phytoplankton are weak indicators of trophic status and that they can well characterize only differences between assemblages and associations. According to calculated saprobic indices (ranging from 1.5 to 2.15), Lake Skadar is on betamesosaprobic level of saprobity, which means that it is moderately polluted with organic compounds. Conclusions. Total phosphorus is not the main limiting factor for the phytoplankton community in Lake Skadar. Disagreements between chlorophyll and the transparency index, on the one hand, and the total phosphorus index, on the other, suggest that the phytoplankton in Lake Skadar is probably limited by other factors than phosphorus, such as nitrogen, toxic substances or intense zooplankton grazing. According to the majority of investigated parameters and indices derived from phytoplankton data, Lake Skadar is mesotrophic, with tendencies toward eutrophic levels during the summer period. Recommendations and Outlook. Long-term monitoring is required for a better estimation of state and the conditions of Lake Skadar. Further studies on factors influencing the phytoplankton community, especially zooplankton grazing and toxic substances, which were not included in this study, should be continued in the future to improve the efficiency of phytoplankton usage in estimating the ecological and trophic conditions of Lake Skadar.

However, the frequent scarcity of plant material in lake sediments makes it difficult to provide robust age estimates. In this study, we performed compound-specific radiocarbon analysis (CSRA) of fatty acids in a sediment core from Lake Kawaguchi in the Mount Fuji volcanic region, Japan, to assess their potential for dating sediments. The C-16 fatty acid in the core top sediments exhibits an almost identical age (983 +/- 56 years BP) to that of dissolved inorganic carbon in the modern lake surface water, which confirms that the carbon of this compound is derived from lake phytoplankton. Comparison of the C-14 age between the C-16 fatty acid and a plant leaf at the widespread (Amagi-Kawagodaira) tephra layer revealed a lake reservoir age of 1,003 +/- 73 C-14 years at ca. 3,150 cal BP, which is consistent with the modern lake reservoir age and the C-14 age of the C-16 fatty acid in the core top sediments, within error. The reservoir-corrected C-14 age of the C-16 fatty acid yielded a modeled age of 2,837 +/- 78 cal BP for the Mount Fuji Tephra (Omuro scoria-fall deposit) in the core. This age is in good agreement with the age determined from plant remains in the same core (2,938 +/- 29 cal BP), indicating that CSRA of C-16 fatty acid has the potential to date lake sediments after reservoir age correction, even in sediments with limited occurrence of plant macrofossils. Plain Language Summary Radiocarbon (C-14) measurements of land plant materials are commonly used to determine the age of lake sediments deposited over the past 50-60,000 years. However, land plant materials are not always abundantly present in lake sediments, which makes it difficult to know precisely when sedimentation occurred. In this study, we measured C-14 ages of fatty acids in lake sediments from the Mount Fuji volcanic region and compared them with those of land plant materials to examine whether the C-14 ages of fatty acids can be used as an alternative tool to determine the ages of the sediments. Our data showed that the carbon of palmitic acid, a fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms, in the sediments likely originated from phytoplankton and is able to produce depositional age that is comparable to the age determined from land plant materials when subtracting the effect of old carbon contribution in the lake water. This is the first successful case that uses palmitic acid to determine the age of lake sediments, and our method is expected to improve chronologies of lake sediments for sites where land plants are scarce.

The mean 14.3 g/l of potassium in the brines in the near-surface halite aquifer makes the Charham Salt Lake an important base for production of potassium fertilizer in China. About 30x10(4) m(3)/day of brines has been pumped from the current ditches in the Bieletan section in the west of the area, creating a cone of depression in the water table near the ditch system. A two-dimensional mathematic model describing the flow of the brines is established to predict the changes in the water table. The flow domain was discretized into 1,185 triangular elements with 641 nodes. Data of brine production through pumping ditches from November 2002 to August 2003 were used to identify the model. The developed model can be employed to predict the exploitation regimes caused by three proposed exploitation schemes A, B and C. A withdrawal rate of 22.67x10(4) m(3)/day of brines is pumped through the current ditch system in scheme A and through the current ditch system plus 16 wells in scheme B. The results of the 5 years predictive simulation for schemes A and B indicate that these rates will cause a normal fall in water table in the pumping period of 9 months and a rise in water table in the recovery period of 3 months in each of the 5 years, with one depression cone near the current ditches in scheme A and two depression cones near the current ditches and the proposed wells in scheme B. In scheme C three more ditch systems are proposed to be excavated in the northeast, northwest and southwest of the Bieletan section and brines are pumped through each of the four ditch systems in turn for 1 year in every 4 years. The predictive simulation results of scheme C suggest that normal changes in the water table will also be expected and a continual increasing or decreasing trend in the water table will not be encountered in a 12-year period of prediction. The water table near each of the four ditch systems will recover sufficiently after a 39-month recovery.																			0943-0105					APR	2006	49	7					1021	1033		10.1007/s00254-005-0140-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0140-x													WOS:000236357100009
J	HORNBACH, DJ; DENEKA, T; MILLER, AC; PAYNE, BS				HORNBACH, DJ; DENEKA, T; MILLER, AC; PAYNE, BS			VARIATIONS IN THE RATE OF SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION IN A BACKWATER LAKE, POOL 2, MISSISSIPPI RIVER	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The rates of sediment deposition in a backwater lake were examined in the summers of 1987, 1988, and 1989 in River Lake (RM 826). To ascertain the spatial variation in sediment accretion, deposition was measured using PVC tubes (height:diameter ratio, 10:1 = 38.1:3.81 cm). Nine replicates were placed at each of three stations along each of three N/S transects of the lake for two-week periods. These transects were parallel to the flow of the river. In 1987 and 1988 the total dry weight and ash-free dry weight of the accumulated sediment was measured in a subsample of the traps. For 1987-1989, the volume of sediment was also assessed. Significant differences were found among transects and stations in the rates of deposition and in the percent organic matter in the deposited sediment. Temporal variation in sediment accretion in the 10:1 traps was noted with deposition being more pronounced in July and August. Analyses indicate that for the 10:1 traps there was a small negative correlation between sedimentation and mean river discharge and that the sediment accumulation as ash-free dry weight was positively correlated to the percent organic matter in the lake sediment. Deposition rates were highest in 1988, a drought year. To examine trap efficiency, for 6 weeks in 1988 and for 14 weeks in 1989 the sampling regimen was expanded to include 5:1 (15.2:3.81 cm) and 2:1 (15.2:7.62 cm) traps. Trap size had a significant effect upon the rate of sediment accretion. The 2:1 and 5:1 traps tended to give higher rates of sedimentation, probably because they sampled a greater proportion of the water column than the 10:1 traps. The 2:1 traps tend to give higher values than the 5:1 or 10:1 traps when weight (dry or ash-free) was used as a measure of sediment deposition but lower rates when volume was used as a measure of deposition.																			0270-5060					MAR	1991	6	1					53	60		10.1080/02705060.1991.9665275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1991.9665275													WOS:A1991FJ43400006

However, long-term records of atmospheric Pb isotopic trends in Asia are still sparse. Consequently, we study changes in the concentrations, fluxes and isotopic signature of deposited Pb contained in a C-14-dated peat core from the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, dating back to 9.5 kyr BP, and present the first peat record of the changing isotopic composition of atmospheric Pb in dust in Asia during this time. Lead concentrations and fluxes vary between 2.96-21.58 mu g g(-1) and 0.06-3.52 mg m(-2) y(-1), respectively, with an average Pb baseline of 6.80 +/- 4.18 mu g g(-1). These values agree with other Pb studies of lake and peat archives in China but are one order of magnitude larger than early and mid-Holocene values measured in Europe. Lead isotopic variability throughout the core is small, varying between Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.190-1.197, Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.648-18.786, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.666-15.694 and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.890-39.090. The application of Bayesian trans-dimensional changepoint modelling to the Pb dataset enabled the identification of eight significant changes in the isotopic composition of the deposited Pb. Such changes mark different phases of atmospheric Pb deposition, and hence variations in atmospheric circulation patterns and environmental conditions. Temporal variations in the potential natural and/or anthropogenic Pb sources are assessed based on the Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208 and Pb-204 isotopic composition and the 1/[Pb] ratio of the peat samples. Our results suggest that Pb deposition throughout the Holocene was governed by local deposition and long-range input from natural dust sources in northwestern (Taklamakan desert and Qaidam basin) and northern China (Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts). Input from the northern sources seems to have been particularly important between 3.1-2.7 kyr BP and 1.7-0.9 kyr BP, suggesting a possible strengthening of the East Asian winter monsoon, in agreement with previous reconstructions in Asia. Based on the Pb/Sc and isotopic composition profiles we do not note any evidence for anthropogenic Pb derived from the thriving mining or smelting activities in northern and eastern China in the last few millennia, suggesting that atmospheric deposition to this region of the eastern Tibetan Plateau was dominated by natural Pb fluxes. These can serve as a true Asian "background" value against which anthropogenic impacts can be quantified. Our results confirm that the combination of radiogenic isotopes (Pb) and trace elements in peat bogs enables observational reconstructions of changes in past regional atmospheric circulation. Such records will enable more refined interpretations of marine and terrestrial palaeorecords in Asia and the Pacific and consequently provide further constraints for changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation and for the testing of palaeoclimate models of circulation patterns.

Little is known, however, about the presence and properties of this receptor in nonmammalian species. In these studies, we sought evidence for an Ah receptor in the liver or liver-equivalent of diverse species of invertebrate and vertebrate animals. Velocity sedimentation analysis of hepatic cytosol labeled with [H-3]TCDD gave equivocal results with three species of marine fish. In subsequent studies, photoaffinity labeling with 2-azido-3-[I-125]iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin was used to identify the Ah receptor. Specific labeling (labeling that could be displaced by an excess of unlabeled ligand) was observed in seven species of teleost and elasmobranch fish, including winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), scup (Stenotomus chrysops), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and dogfish (Mustelus canis and Squalus acanthias). Specific labeling was also found in cytosolic fractions prepared from PLHC-1 fish hepatoma cells and livers of a turtle (Chrysemys picta) and a cetacean, the beluga whale Delphinapterus leucas. The fish Ah receptor was sensitive to conditions of tissue preparation; inclusion of proteinase inhibitors in the homogenization buffer stabilized the receptor in some species. There was heterogeneity in the apparent molecular mass of the largest specifically labeled band in each species; these ranged from 105 to 146 kDa, slightly larger on average than mammalian Ah receptors (95-130 kDa). In contrast to the results obtained with teleost and elasmobranch fish, no specifically labeled polypeptides were detectable in cytosol from two agnathan fish species (hagfish Myxine glutinosa and sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus), the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, or any of nine other invertebrate species representing eight classes in four phyla. Overall these results suggest that the Ah receptor evolved at least 450 million years ago, prior to the divergence of bony and cartilaginous fishes. Although the exact relationship between receptor presence and dioxin responsiveness in these species is uncertain, our data predict that the invertebrate species examined in this study, which appear to lack an Ah receptor protein like that seen in mammals and fish, may be less sensitive than vertebrates to the effects of environmental contaminants that act through this transcriptional regulator.

Condensate is one of the important sources of water for plants in arid zones and plays an important role in alleviating the physiological state of plant water. In order to clarify the ecological role of the leaf absorption of condensation water, we took the dominant species of the desert Dugay forest plant, Populus euphratica, as the research object, and based on in situ leaf humidification field experiments, we comprehensively analyzed the effect of condensation water on the physiological state of P. euphratica and the ecological benefit of leaf water absorption on the arid zone by determining the parameters of the physiological indexes of the leaf, the leaf wettability, and the water-absorbing capacity of the leaf. The results showed that P. euphratica leaves have a water-absorbing ability on both sides, and under the condensation water treatment, the water potential of dawn leaves in the TR group (-1.75 +/- 0.12 MPa) was significantly higher than that in the CK group (-1.41 +/- 0.13 Mpa); the net photosynthetic rate of leaves in the TR group (13.08 +/- 0.68 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the CK group (10.42 +/- 0.57 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)); the proline content of the TR group (22.82 +/- 0.8 mu g<middle dot>g(-1)) was significantly lower than that of the CK group (68.67 +/- 6.14 mu g<middle dot>g(-1)); and the leaf photosynthetic capacity, leaf osmotic adjustment, and stress tolerance affected by condensation water were significantly different (p < 0.05). A leaf's water-absorbing ability is mainly affected by leaf wettability, the proline content, and other influencing factors. The mean FWU rate was positively correlated with the mean transpiration rate. Within the Ebinur Lake watershed, the water absorption rate of P. euphratica leaves accounts for 10.92% of the maximum transpiration rate (T-r); in 2022, the total summer leaf surface water uptake by P. euphratica was about 220.5 mol, a value that represents about 0.25% of the average annual evapotranspiration from Ebinur Lake. This study helps to improve the understanding of the impact of condensation water on the physiological ecology of the desert plant P. euphratica and provides a scientific basis for the ecological benefits of leaf water absorption in arid regions.					tian, junhao/KSM-8193-2024															1999-4907				MAR	2024	15	3							430	10.3390/f15030430	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f15030430													WOS:001191982000001

The Influence of Geology and Geography on the Indian Wars in Eastern Washington Territory	MILITARY GEOSCIENCES AND DESERT WARFARE: PAST LESSONS AND MODERN CHALLENGES	Advances in Military Geosciences				9th International Conference on Military Geosciences (ICMG)	JUN 20-24, 2011	Las Vegas, NV					It was a spring day in 1858 and Col. Edward Steptoe was riding north through the rolling grass prairie that covers the loess hills on the eastern side of the Columbia Basalt Plateau. His mission was to support settlers and miners in the northern part of Washington Territory with a show of force. A combined force of 1000 Plateau Indians of the Palouse, Walla Walla, Coeur d'Alene, and Spokane tribes stopped Steptoe at the Battle of Tohotonimme near Rosalia, Washington. The extensive loess "dune" fields allowed for concealed rapid movement of the mounted natives. The army dragoons were vastly outnumbered as they took a stand on a loess hilltop. Darkness, luckily, ended the battle and the troops fled south to Fort Walla Walla. It was a humiliating defeat for the army and quickly a better-equipped force under Col. George Wright was assembled to put an abrupt end to native resistance. In September, at the battles of Four Lakes and West Plains near Spokane, the army defeated the Plateau Indians. Wright positioned his troops armed with modern rifles and artillery on high ground created from basement rocks that rise above the flat basalt plains preferred by the mounted Indians. Both the Steptoe and Wright campaigns were significantly influenced by the geology and geography of eastern Washington. The juxtaposition of hills of older basement rock, a Miocene basalt plateau, and Pleistocene paraglacial loess fields and outburst flood deposits created topography with geomorphic features that were used advantageously by both sides in the conflict. The type locality of the geomorphic feature known as a steptoe is located just south of Rosalia, the site of Steptoe's defeat. These military campaigns of 1858 can be placed in the larger context involving the settlement of the Oregon country and the conflicting philosophies of land and water use of the Native Americans and the settlers. The Plateau Indians were traditional hunters, gatherers, and fishermen. With the coming of the Hudson's Bay Company, they were encouraged to trap beaver. Beginning in the 1840s, the Oregon Trail brought settlers from the eastern United States who began farming and mining, bringing Indians and settlers into conflict. In the 1850s a military road through the area further inflamed tensions. Although the Indian wars have long ended, conflict still exists in regards to land and water rights, involving fishing, hydroelectric power, and the honoring of past treaties.																					978-1-4939-3429-4; 978-1-4939-3427-0				2016							67	82		10.1007/978-1-4939-3429-4_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-3429-4_5													WOS:000389807200005

The study of small water bodies contributes to understanding aquatic organisms' adaptation to sharp fluctuations in external factors. Studies of biological communities' response to fluctuations in external factors can be used for bioindication of the ecological state of small water bodies. In this regard, the purpose of the research is to study the structure of zooplankton of small lakes in South-East Kazakhstan in connection with various physicochemical parameters to understand the role of biological variables in assessing the ecological state of aquatic ecosystems. According to hydrochemical data in summer 2019, the nutrient content was relatively high in all studied lakes. A total of 74 species were recorded in phytoplankton. The phytoplankton abundance varied significantly, from 8.5 x 10(7) to 2.71667 x 10(9) cells/m(3), with a biomass from 0.4 to 15.81 g/m(3). Shannon diversity index of phytoplankton in the lakes at high altitude varied from 1.33 to 2.39 and from 0.46 to 3.65 in the lakes at lower altitudes. The average weight of the cells of algae species varied from 0.2079 to 1.5076 x 10(-6) mg in the lakes at lower altitudes, the average weight of the cells of algae species changed from 0.6682 to 1.2963 x 10(-6) mg in the lakes at higher altitudes. Zooplankton was represented by 58 taxa. The total abundance of zooplankton varied from 0.05 to 169.00 thousand ind./m(3) with biomass of 0.51-349.01 mg/m(3). Shannon diversity of zooplankton in the lakes at lower altitude fluctuated from 0.42 to 2.32 and it was 0.66-1.77 in the lakes at higher altitudes. The average individual mass of specimens in zooplankton in mountain lakes ranged from 0.021 to 0.037 mg and varied from 0.002 to 0.007 mg in other lakes. The main factors in the development of the structure of zooplankton communities in small lakes were temperature, TDS, the content of nitrates, phosphates, and the composition and biomass of planktonic algae. The hydrochemical and biological data of the investigated lakes indicated their organic pollution. Our results once again confirmed the applicability of structural variables of zooplankton in assessing water quality.

J	GILLIOM, RJ				GILLIOM, RJ			ESTIMATION OF BACKGROUND LOADINGS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS FOR LAKES IN THE PUGET SOUND REGION, WASHINGTON	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												For lakes in watersheds that include substantial developed land the evaluation of eutrophication is facilitated by a knowledge of changes in the lake''s P concentrations that have occurred since development. Background (predevelopment) concentration data do not exist for many lakes. A method for estimating background P concentrations in lakes of the Puget Sound lowland was developed. Using a mass balance Vollenweider-type model, P loadings were calculated from present-day P concentrations measured in lake water and physical characteristics for 24 lakes in undeveloped or insignificantly developed, watersheds. From other studies, annual P loading by bulk precipitation directly on a lake''s surface was estimated to be 20 kg/km2. Loading of P from forest (undeveloped) land was derived for each lake as the difference between calculated P loading to the lake and loading by bulk precipitation. Forest land loading to each lake was converted to the annual yield (mass/unit area) of the forested portion of the watershed. P yield from forest land was logarithmically related to annual runoff and the regression equation expressing this relationship explained 73% of the sample variance. By applying that regression equation to the appropriate annual runoff data the yield of P from forest land was estimated for any lake in the study area. Loading of P from forested watershed land, calculated from forest land yield, could be added to direct loading by bulk precipitation to estimate background P loading for each lake. By applying the mass balance model to these calculated background loadings, backgrond total-P concentrations could be calculated for all lakes in the study area that had stable thermal stratification during the summer. SE of estimate for calculated background loadings and concentrations averaged .apprx. 25% for most lakes in the area. The method provided reliable estimates of background (predevelopment) P loads and concentrations for Puget Sound region lakes using data available for most lakes in the region. These estimates can be compared to present-day P levels in developed lakes to assess the impact that land use changes had on lake water quality.																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1981	17	2					410	420		10.1029/WR017i002p00410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR017i002p00410													WOS:A1981LP03600016
J	Wernicke, B				Wernicke, Brian			The California River and its role in carving Grand Canyon	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Recently published thermochronological and paleoelevation studies in the Grand Canyon region, combined with sedimentary provenance data in both the coastal and interior portions of the North American Cordillera, place important new constraints on the paleohydrological evolution of the southwestern United States. Review and synthesis of these data lead to an interpretation where incision of a large canyon from a plain of low elevation and relief to a canyon of roughly the length and depth of modern Grand Canyon occurred primarily in Campanian time (80-70 Ma). Incision was accomplished by a main-stem, NE-flowing antecedent river with headwaters on the NE slope of the North American Cordillera in California, referred to herein after its source region as the California River. At this time, the river had cut to within a few hundred meters of its modern erosion level in western Grand Canyon, and to the level of Lower Mesozoic strata in eastern Grand Canyon. Subsequent collapse of the head waters region into a continental border land and coeval uplift of the Cordilleran foreland during the Laramide orogeny reversed the river's course by Paleogene time. After reversal, its terminus lay near its former source regions in what is now the Western Transverse Ranges and Salinian terrane. Its headwaters lay in the ancient Mojave/Mogollon Highlands region of Arizona and eastern California, apparently reaching as far northeast as the eastern Grand Canyon region. This system is herein referred to after its source region as the Arizona River. From Paleogene through late Miocene time, the interior of the Colorado Plateau was a closed basin separated from the Arizona River drainage by an asymmetrical divide in the Lees Ferry-Glen Canyon area, with a steep SW flank and gently sloping NE flank that drained into large interior lakes, fed primarily by Cordilleran/Rocky Mountain sources to the north and west, and by recycled California River detritus shed from Laramide uplifts on the plateau. By Oligocene time, the lakes had largely dried up and were replaced by ergs. By mid-Miocene time, a pulse of unroofing had lowered the erosion level of eastern Grand Canyon to within a few hundred meters of its present level, and the Arizona River drainage below modern Grand Canyon was deranged by extensional tectonism, cutting off the supply of interior detritus to the coast. Increasing moisture in the Rocky Mountains in late Miocene time reinvigorated fluvio lacustrine aggradation NE of the asymmetrical divide, which was finally overtopped between 6 and 5 Ma, lowering base level in the interior of the plateau by 1500 m. This event reintegrated the former Arizona drainage system through a cascade of spillover events through Basin and Range valleys, for the first time connecting sediment sources in Colorado with the coast. This event, combined with the intensification of summer rainfall as the Gulf of California opened, increased the sediment yield through Grand Canyon by perhaps two orders of magnitude from its Miocene nadir, giving birth to the modern subcontinental-scale Colorado River drainage system. The Colorado River has thus played a major role in unroofing the interior of the Colorado Plateau, but was not an important factor in the excavation of Grand Canyon.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2011	123	7-8					1288	1316		10.1130/B30274.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B30274.1													WOS:000291248800006
J	Haberman, J; Laugaste, R				Haberman, J; Laugaste, R			On characteristics reflecting the trophic state of large and shallow Estonian lakes (L. Peipsi, L. Vortsjarv)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Mean zooplankter weight (W-Zp) and the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass (B-Zp/B-Phyt) reflect adequately the trophic state of a body of water; they decrease with increasing trophy. In the moderately trophic Lake Peipsi, W-Zp is 4.4 mug and in the strongly eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv, 2.7 mug, while B-Zp/B-Phyt is 0.49 and 0.13, respectively. Mean cladoceran weight is 28 and 10 mug, mean copepod weight 10 and 6.7 mug, mean rotifer weight 0.9 and 0.6 mug, respectively. Interestingly, in winter, W-Zp and B-Zp/B-Phyt are also significantly larger for L. Peipsi compared with L. Vortsjarv: W-Zp 1.2 and 0.7 mug, B-Zp/B-Phyt 0.4 and 0.1, respectively. This difference is caused by E. gracilis (Sars) and Cyclops kolensis Lilljeborg which are still living in L. Peipsi, but have disappeared from L. Vortsjarv. From the 1960s up to the present W-Zp has decreased appreciably. Correlation analysis showed the weak relationship between the studied characteristics and nutrient content, while the relationship between mean weight and water nutrient content is more pronounced in the strongly eutrophic L. Vortsjarv than in L. Peipsi. There was a positive correlation between W-Zp and the biomass of the genus Daphnia in L. Peipsi, while in L. Vortsjarv W-Zp was positively correlated with the biomass of Chydorus sphaericus. In L. Vortsjarv, W-Zp was negatively correlated with the abundance and biomass of rotifers, as well as with the abundance of zooplankton comprised primarily of rotifers. A clear difference in both characteristics was revealed in the comparison of Lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv with ANOVA (p-level 0.002-<0.0001 for the years 1997-2001). W-Zp and B-Zp/B-Phyt characterize both the trophy and the whole ecosystem of a body of water. Indirectly, they characterize dominating groups in phytoplankton and zooplankton, feeding relationships between phyto- and zooplankton and between zooplankton and fish, as well as the pressure of fish on zooplankton. The W-Zp and B-Zp/B-Phyt can be used as marker characteristics in the evaluation of the trophy of a body of water and its ecosystem and, particularly, in permanent monitoring of bodies of water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					737	744		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008572.77431.1b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008572.77431.1b													WOS:000188455600095
J	Pichler, T; Veizer, J				Pichler, T; Veizer, J			The precipitation of aragonite from shallow-water hydrothermal fluids in a coral reef, Tutum Bay, Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The fringing reef in Tutum Bay on the west side of Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea is the only presently known coral reef exposed to the extensive discharge of a hot, mineralized hydrothermal fluid. There, aragonite and ferrihydrite, a hydrous ferric oxide, are the prominent hydrothermal precipitates. Aragonite forms two distinct crystal habits, (a) euhedral (pseudohexagonal) crystals up to 2 cm long and (b) micro-crystals similar in appearance to "feather dendrite". Aragonite encrusts dead coral fragments, volcanielastic boulders and pebbles, and fills secondary fracture and remaining primary intergranular porosity within volcaniclastic arenite. The hydrothermal aragonite has a distinctively different isotopic composition when compared to "normal" shallow-water marine inorganic and organic carbonate that precipitated from seawater. This difference arises from precipitation at high temperature from a mixture of seawater and hydrothermal fluid that has lower Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta(18)O values than seawater. Based on a Sr-87/Sr-86 mixing model, aragonite precipitated from a hydrothermal fluid-seawater mixture of approximately 9:1. Precipitation from the hydrothermal solution is mainly caused by CO2 degassing, but mixing between hydrothermal fluid and seawater may have enhanced precipitation due to an increase in pH. The delta(13)C of Tuturn Bay hydrothermal aragonite ranges from 1.9parts per thousand to 2.2parts per thousand (VPDB). This range of values is in good agreement with experimental data [J. Phys. Chem. 72 (1968) 800; Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61 (1997) 3461], indicating that C-13-equilibirum has been reached during its formation. Values for delta(18)O range from 14.2parts per thousand to 14.7parts per thousand and calculated isotopic equilibrium temperatures are approximately 20 degreesC lower than directly measured vent fluids and those temperatures obtained from fluid inclusion experiments and the Sr-87/Sr-86 mixing model. This indicates that either oxygen isotope equilibrium was not attained or that the calcite-water fractionation factor for oxygen isotopes is not applicable for the precipitation of Tutum, Bay hydrothermal aragonite. Trace element concentrations except for the REEs, Y and Sr are low. The REE patterns of aragonite are similar to those of Tuturn Bay vent water, indicating the hydrothermal origin of the aragonite. Rare earth element concentrations are higher in the coarse than in the fine-grained aragonite, which might be caused by a change in precipitation rate and seawater mixing. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Observations of Titan's Northern lakes at 5 μm: Implications for the organic cycle and geology	ICARUS												Since Titan entered Northern spring in August 2009, the North Pole has been illuminated allowing observations at optical wavelengths. On June 5, 2010 the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft observed the Northern Pole area with a pixel size from 3 to 7 km. Since, as we demonstrate, little of the solar flux at 5 pm is scattered by the atmosphere, these observations were obtained at relatively large incidence angles and allowed us to build a mosaic covering an area of more than 500,000 km(2) that overlaps and complements observations made by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in 2007. We find that there is an excellent correlation between the shape of the radar dark area, known as Ligeia Mare and the VIMS 5-mu m dark unit. Matching most of the radar shoreline, the 2010 VIMS observations suggest that the 125,000-km(2) surface area of Ligeia Mare measured by RADAR in 2007 has not significantly changed. The VIMS observations complement the radar observations to the west of Ligeia Mare and suggest that Ligeia Mare is connected to Kraken Mare by either a diffuse network similar to a swamp area, or by well-defined, sub-pixel rivers. Considering the results of recent evaporation models of methane, our preferred interpretation of the relative constancy in surface area of Ligeia is that it is principally composed of ethane although we cannot rule out the possibility that methane evaporation is balanced with replenishment by either precipitation or underground seepage. There is also strong correlation between the location of the small radar lakes and the small VIMS 5-mu m dark patches. The geographic location of the small lakes are within a VIMS pixel of the SAR location, suggesting that the non-synchronous component of Titan's spin rate, if it exists, was less than 2.3 x 10(-4) deg/day between 2007 and 2010 in agreement with the recent T64 radar observations. These observations question the existence of non-synchronous rotation. Two radar-bright features appear dark at 5-mu m. The simplest interpretation is that these are very shallow lakes, less than one meter deep. Three new small lakes, named Freeman, Cardiel, and Towada by the IAU, are found outside of the area mapped with the SAR. A single-scattering model describing reflection of sunlight at 5-mu m suggests that the lake surface is mirror-like and that the albedo of the solid surfaces surrounding the lakes is about 8%. These observations together with information of the haze aerosols allow us to show that Titan's lakes, atmospheric ethane and aerosol haze are smaller carbon reservoirs than Titan's sand dunes and atmospheric methane. A simple model involving an outburst of methane a few hundreds of Myr ago followed by the dissociation of methane in the atmosphere leading to the formation of the haze particles that constitute the dune fields would be consistent with both the present observations and recent measurements of isotopic ratios in atmospheric methane (Mandt, K.E. et al.

J	Aas, E; Hojerslev, NK				Aas, E; Hojerslev, NK			Analysis of underwater radiance observations: Apparent optical properties and analytic functions describing the angular radiance distribution	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A primary data set consisting of 70 series of angular radiance distributions observed in clear blue western Mediterranean water and a secondary set of 12 series from the more green and turbid Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, have been analyzed. The results demonstrate that the main variation of the shape of the downward radiance distribution occurs within the Snell cone. Outside the cone the variation of the shape decreases with increasing zenith angle. The most important shape changes of the upward radiance appear within the zenith angle range 90 degrees-130 degrees. The variation in shape reaches its minimum around nadir, where an almost constant upward radiance distribution implies that a flat sea surface acts like a Lambert emitter within +/-8% in the zenith angle interval 140 degrees-180 degrees in air. The ratio Q of upward irradiance and nadir radiance, as well as the average cosines mu(d) and mu(u) for downward and upward radiance, respectively; have rather small standard deviations, 110%, within the local water type. In contrast, the irradiance reflectance R has been observed to change up to 400% with depth in the western Mediterranean, while the maximum observed change of Q with depth is only 40%. The dependence of Q on the solar elevation for blue light at 5 m depth in the Mediterranean coincides with observations from the central Atlantic as well as with model computations. The corresponding dependence of mu(d) shows that diffuse light may have a significant influence on its value. Two simple functions describing the observed angular radiance distributions are proposed, and both functions can be determined by two field observations as input parameters. The epsilon function approximates the azimuthal means of downward radiance with an average error less than or equal to 7% and of upward radiance with an error of similar to 1%. The alpha function describes the zenith angle dependence of the azimuthal means of upward radiance with an average error less than or equal to 7% in clear ocean water, increasing to less than or equal to 20% in turbid lake water. The alpha function suggests that the range of variation for mu(u), falls between 0 and 1/2, and for Q it is between pi and 2 pi. The limits of both ranges are confirmed by observations. By combining the epsilon and alpha functions, a complete angular description of the upward radiance field is achieved.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 15	1999	104	C4					8015	8024		10.1029/1998JC900088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1998JC900088													WOS:000079784700029
J	ALTHER, GR				ALTHER, GR			MONITORING OF DESCENDING DREDGED MATERIAL PLUMES	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Monitoring of 2 disposal operations on Lake Erie near Ashtabula, Ohio [USA], provided an opportunity to employ different approaches to study the physical impact of the disposal of dredged material on the hydraulic regime of the lake in this area. A study conducted in Aug. 1975 involved utilization of several transmissometers placed on 4 anchored vessels and 1 moving vessel. The transmissometers were used to monitor the dispersing plume over time. 3-Dimensional plots revealed that plumes tended to decrease in intensity beyond .apprx. 100 m from the point of discharge. Data interpretation was hampered due to difficulties in correlating data obtained from different transmissometers, and because the direction of the plume could not always be anticipated with accuracy so that the major portion of the plume sometimes bypassed the boat further away undetected. In May, 1976, another dredging operation was monitored by utilizing over-the-side current meters and thermographs placed on an anchored vessel, and by tracing the plume with recording echo sounders. The measurements indicated that .apprx. a 2.degree. C temperature increase near the disposal site resulted from the discharged material falling to the bottom. The discharge also produced surges in the currents with speeds reaching 70 cm/s. These changes returned to normal within a few min. The sediment plumes were tracked with a moving vessel by using the echo sounder, which was able to accoustically detect the suspended sediments. The measurements showed that the material settled quickly and the conditions returned to ambient within 1 h. Measurements of current speeds transmissivity and sediment plume movements taken in the disposal area indicated that the disposal of the dredged material had some short-term effect but no long-term effect on the physical nature of the area. Sediment piles from accumulating dredged material could be defined by empolying bathymetric surveys, sediment traps, survey rods and radiographs. The piles usually grew to a height of .apprx. 35 cm and were difficult to distinguish by means of echo sounders only. By employing discriminant analysis it was possible to discern the similar dredged material and original lake bottom sediments based on their grain-size distribution.																			0030-0950						1984	84	1					19	28																WOS:A1984SM12600005

Determinations were made of the total Co content of different particle-sized fractions from various horizons of 2 soils and of the A horizons of 20 of the most important agricultural soils of the state. Alfalfa from field plots limed to different pH levels was analyzed to determine the effect of soil reaction on the availability of soil Co. The effect on Co uptake of different levels of Mn and Fe was studied in soln. culture with Co60. 34 plant spp. were grown in field under identical conditions to determine their comparative Co contents. The total Co content of New Jersey soils ranged between 0.2 and 30.8 ppm. Coastal Plain soils contained less Co than did those from the Appalachian Province. The texture of soil was an important factor in determining Co content. The average Co content of alfalfa from various soils in New Jersey ranged between 0.05 and 0.22 ppm. Plants from poorly drained soils were higher in Co than were those from the well-drained soils. It was estimated that alfalfa grown on the most important agricultural soils of the state would contain only betwen 0.04 and 0.97 ppm. Co, amts. considered insufficient for the needs of sheep. All samples collected from Lakewood and Squires soils and more than 50% of those from the Collington and Rockaway soils fell into this category. Applications of liming materials reduced availability of soil Co. Alfalfa from soils with pH values above 7.2 contained only about half as much Co as did that from soils with pH values of 5.8. An increase in the amt. of available Mn or Fe in a nutrient solution caused a marked reduction in the amt. of Co taken up by the plant.

J	Morris, JR				Morris, Justin R.			Development and commercialization of a complete vineyard mechanization system	HORTTECHNOLOGY					Annual Conference of the American-Society-for-Horticultural-Science	JUL   30, 2006	New Orleans, LA	Amer Soc Horticultural Sci				A major research thrust of the University of Arkansas Enology and Viticulture Program for the past 37 years has been the development of a total vineyard mechanization system. This new system allows the mechanization of almost all practices in vineyard operations, including dormant and summer pruning, leaf removal, shoot and fruit thinning, canopy management, and harvesting while fruit quality is maintained or enhanced. Research efforts aimed to accomplish these tasks on the 12 major trellising systems used throughout the industry and to derive plans for the sequencing and timing of operations on each of the trellis systems. In 2002, the University of Arkansas patented the Morris-Oldridge Vineyard Mechanization System (M-O System). OXBO International Corp., Clear Lake, WI, purchased the patent and market M-O System components under the name Korvan (TM) Vineyard System. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanized (machine-farmed) pruning, shoot thinning, and fruit thinning using the M-O System vs. traditional methods of canopy management using hand labor (hand-farmed) in a commercial Vitis vinifera vineyard in the central coast region of California. V. vinifera cultivars evaluated included Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Syrah trellised on a lyre system and Merlot, Zinfandel, and Sangiovese trellised on a vertical shoot-positioned (VSP) system. Yield, fruit growth, fruit composition, wine quality, wine sensory attributes, and economics of mechanization were evaluated on machine- and hand-farmed grapes. Mechanized studies were initiated at French Camp Vineyards, Santa Margarita, CA, in 2002. French Camp Vineyards used a balanced cropping concept which incorporated three operations: 1) machine dormant pruning, 2) machine shoot thinning, and 3) machine fruit thinning. Results of research from 2002 to 2005 showed that yield and quality characteristics of machine-farmed grapes were not statistically different from those of hand-farmed grapes for the V. vinifera cultivars in this study. Wines from each cultivar and treatment were produced at a commercial winery and after appropriate aging, were sensory-evaluated by a professional wine analysis service. Few sensory differences were found between wines from the two farming systems. Further objective analyses of the wine components showed no commercially practical differences. In 2006, cost estimates were derived for the three vineyard activities necessary to achieve balanced cropping. Use of machine farming for balanced cropping operations resulted in savings over hand farming of 45% on the lyre trellis, 49% on the VSP system, and 62% on the quadrilateral trellis for the operations studied. Studies of mechanization of vineyard activities using the M-O System to achieve balanced cropping have shown that grapes and their wines were equivalent to those obtained using hand labor for these operations with the added benefit of cost savings for the operations evaluated.																			1063-0198					OCT-DEC	2007	17	4					411	420		10.21273/HORTTECH.17.4.411	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.17.4.411													WOS:000249637600001

Reconstructing paleoenvironment, eruption mechanism and paleomorphology of the Pliocene Pula maar, (Hungary)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Pula maar is a partially eroded Pliocene maar-diatreme volcano, part of the Mio-Pliocene Bakony-Balaton Highland Volcanic Field. The surficial remnant of the maar-diatreme volcano consists of (1) a distinct depression with a thick post-eruptive lacustrine alginite sediment infill interbedded with coarse-grained volcaniclastic sediments, (2) a narrow marginal zone inside the depression consisting of primary pyroclastic rock units that are interpreted to be partly collapsed and subsided blocks of entire sections from the tephra ring formerly surrounding the maar crater depression, and (3) coarse-grained volcaniclastic debris-flow deposits closely associated with the collapsed primary pyroclastic rock units in the marginal zone. The presence of coherent lava rocks below the crater-fill units, their distribution pattern and their association with scoriaceous beds indicate that, after the maar-diatreme-forming phreatomagmatic explosive activity, small (100 m-scale) scoria and/or spatter cones erupted in the maar crater. These cones are the likely source of the lava flows that partially filled the maar crater basin. The widespread dm-to-m thick basaltic sand and/ or silt units at the base of the post-eruptive crater-filling sedimentary succession are interpreted to be reworked volcaniclastic material from the intra-maar scoria/spatter cones as well as from the tephra ring. Based on comparative analyses of 53 core descriptions, this study reveals that the original maar crater basin was larger than previously suggested. The deep level of the maar crater is reconstructed to be a northeast-southwest elongated depression, currently forming a c. 50-m-deep basin. Geomorphological considerations suggest that most of the phreatomagmatic pyroclastic rocks are composed of base surge and tephra fall deposits around the deep maar depression. These allochthonous rock units form a 50-400 m wide zone of proximal tuff-ring sequences. The formation of this zone is inferred to be a result of a combination of syneruptive subsidence due to mass deficit in the rigid Triassic dolomite basement caused by the phreatomagmatic explosions as well as post-eruptive subsidence of the crater- and diatreme-filling successions due to diagenetic compaction. The facies in the centre of the maar lake is a soft laminated "alginite" (mainly Botryococcus colonies, diatom frustles, calcium carbonate crystals, clay minerals). In the section exposed in the Pula open cast mine, a single turbiditic layer is present. This layer originated in a landslide, which possibly could have been caused by either syn-eruptive earthquake and/or a sudden posteruptive subsidence event of the diatreme fill.

J	Kano, K; Ohguchi, T				Kano, Kazuhiko; Ohguchi, Takeshi			Intra-crater deposits of the Toga tuff ring, Oga Peninsula, NE Japan	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					17th International Sedimentological Congress	AUG 27-SEP 01, 2006	Fukuoka, JAPAN					The Toga tuff ring is a large, dissected tuff ring located on the modern shoreline of the Oga Peninsula, NE Japan. The crater measures 2 km by 2.4 km and the inner crater walls are inclined inward at 40-50 to form a funnel shape. Intra-crater beds are mainly composed of platy or blocky, non-to variably vesicular glass shards and pumice lapilli of K-rich rhyolite composition and dip inward at 10-30 or less. A gravity model suggests they fill the downward-tapering conduit to a depth of 548 m below sea level. Fission-track dates from the intra-crater deposits indicate the age of the Toga tuff ring is ca. 420 ka, likely corresponding to a stage of global sea-level fall, MIS 12. Subsequent sea-level rise and marine transgression is inferred to have resulted in erosion of almost the entire outer tuff ring by post-eruptive wave action. The intra-crater deposit's are exposed over a thickness of 50 m in the deeply incised crater floor. They comprise mainly monomictic tephra of phreatomagmatic origin and are similar in grain-size distribution and sedimentary structures to relatively high and low density turbidites, although the constituents, sparse block-sag structures, and multiple fluid-escape dikes suggest that they are the subaqueous equivalents of high-and low-density pyroclastic currents with similar grain-sizes and degree of grain-size sorting. Marine diatom frustules sparsely contained in the deposits suggest that the crater was likely open to the sea, enabling rapid access of seawater to the vent. Pyroclasts ejected through the water. owed back into the crater to form eruption-fed oscillatory or circular turbidity currents and were repeatedly recycled and variably abraded by subsequent explosions, while many juvenile pumice lapilli and ash grains were carried beyond the crater rim to form relatively dilute pyroclastic currents. The Toga example suggests that primary deposits emplaced in crater lakes are well sorted, graded and stratified with polymodal flow directions, sparse block-sags, and vesicular and fragile fragments that are more or less abraded by repeated explosions and recycling.

Three cases of such environments are surveyed at MOC high resolution in the E-Gorgonum chaos and Newton and Hale craters. The regional setting of these craters suggests that the mechanisms of aquifer destabilization, flow discharge, and gully formation in these three cases result from local geological triggers that can include impact cratering, and tectonic processes, rather than climate or insolation factor. We take as a working hypothesis that microbial life appeared on Mars in ancient geological times, probably in a geothermal environment but potentially evolving via infrared detection systems to give photosynthetic communities under the selective pressure of energetic solar radiation. We hypothesize that some microbial communities could have survived underground in either dormant or active state, or that their biomolecules could be preserved either frozen or desiccated in the subsurface beneath the upper oxidized zone. We assess the known environmental constraints for life and what type of potential habitats are provided in these three craters by aquifer discharges using comparison with terrestrial analogues and their associated microbial communities. These environments include: (1) the release of water on a dry crater floor in E-Gorgonum and the possibility for microorganisms and preserved biomolecules to be flushed out and mixed in with the sediment exposed at the surface; (2) the evidence of a recent lacustrine episode in the Newton crater with analogy to Antarctic Dry Valley lakes; (3) the exposure on the floor of Hale crater of material from a regional subsurface that is likely to have retained traces of one of the oldest martian bodies of water recognized to date (Parker et al. 2000) in the Argyre basin. We show how the water in Argyre (similar to3.8 billion years ago (Gya) was likely to have been alterated by hydrothermal processes and how the subsequent formation of the 150-km Hale crater on the northern ring of Argyre generated hydrothermal pumping. This accounts for the anomalously high location of the springs on the crater crests today with respect to the rest of the regional subsurface distribution. Finally, we envision current impact cratering as a factor for destabilizing aquifers on Mars today, thus creating new environments. We analyze the implications of impacts for two geological types of rock units that could harbor traces of life. As a result, we compare the potential of astrobiological exploration of crater floors, rims, and ejecta on future missions to Mars.

Late Noachian and early Hesperian ridge systems in the south circumpolar Dorsa Argentea Formation, Mars: Evidence for two stages of melting of an extensive late Noachian ice sheet	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The Dorsa Argentea Formation (DAF), extending from 270 degrees-100 degrees E and 70 degrees-90 degrees S, is a huge circumpolar deposit surrounding and underlying the Late Amazonian South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD) of Mars. Currently mapped as Early-Late Hesperian in age, the Dorsa Argentea Formation has been interpreted as volatile-rich, possibly representing the remnants of an ancient polar ice cap. Uncertain are its age (due to the possibility of poor crater retention in ice-related deposits), its mode of origin, the origin of the distinctive sinuous ridges and cavi that characterize the unit, and its significance in the climate history of Mars. In order to assess the age of activity associated with the DAF, we examined the ridge populations within the Dorsa Argentea Formation, mapping and characterizing seven different ridge systems (composed of nearly 4,000 ridges covering a total area of similar to 300,000 km(2), with a cumulative length of ridges of similar to 51,000 km) and performing crater counts on them using the method of buffered crater counting to determine crater retention ages of the ridge populations. We examined the major characteristics of the ridge systems and found that the majority of them were consistent with an origin as eskers, sediment-filled subglacial drainage channels. Ridge morphologies reflect both distributed and channelized esker systems, and evidence is also seen that some ridges form looping moraine-like termini distal to some distributed systems. The ridge populations fall into two age groups: ridge systems between 270 degrees and 0 degrees E date to the Early Hesperian, but to the east, the Promethei Planum and the Chasmata ridge systems date to the Late Noachian. Thus, these ages, and esker and moraine-like morphologies, support the interpretation that the DAF is a remnant ice sheet deposit, and that the esker systems represent evidence of significant melting and drainage of meltwater from portions of this ice sheet, thus indicating at least some regions and/or periods of wet-based glaciation. The Late Noachian and Early Hesperian ages of the ridge systems closely correspond to the ages of valley network/open basin lake systems, representing runoff, drainage and storage of liquid water in non-polar regions of the surface of Mars. Potential causes of such wet-based conditions in the DAF include: 1) top-down melting due to atmospheric warming, 2) enhanced snow and ice accumulation and raising of the melting isotherm, to the base of the ice sheet, or 3) basal melting associated with intrusive volcanism (volcano-ice interactions). The early phase of melting is closely correlated in time with valley network formation and thus may be due to global atmospheric warming, while the later phase of melting may be linked to Early Hesperian global volcanism and specific volcano-ice interactions (table mountains) in the DAF Crater ages indicate that these wet-based conditions ceased by the Late Hesperian, and that further retreat of the DAF to its present configuration occurred largely through sublimation, not melting, thus preserving the extensive ridge systems. MARSIS radar data suggest that significant areas of layered, potentially ice-rich parts of the Dorsa Argentea Formation remain today. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd..

The paper largely concerns silicon levels in streams, rivers and lakes based on extensive data collected as part of several research and monitoring initiatives of national and international standing. For a detailed study of an upland catchment in mid-Wales, information on atmospheric inputs and groundwater chemistries is provided to supply background information to cross link to the surface water chemistry. Several hundred streams/rivers and lakes are dealt with within the study, dealing with the main types of freshwater riverine and lacustrine environments. The streams/rivers vary from small ephemeral runoff to the major rivers of the UK. The geographical location of sites vary from local sites in mid-Wales, to regional studies across Scotland, to the major eastern UK rivers entering the North Sea and to acid sensitive upland sites across Wales, the English Lake District, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The surface waters range in silicon concentration from 0 to 19 mg-Si 1(-1) (average for individual sites vary between 0.7 and 7.6 mg-Si 1(-1)) and there are some clear variations which link to two primary processes (1) the relative inputs of groundwaters enriched in silicon and near surface waters more depleted in silicon and (2) plankton uptake of silicon during the summer months under baseflow conditions. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the waters are approximately saturated with respect to either quartz or chalcedony except for two circumstances when undersaturation occurs. Firstly, undersaturation occurs at pH less than 5.5 in the upland. areas and this is because the waters are mainly sourced from the acidic organic soils which are depleted in inorganic minerals. Secondly, undersaturation occurs in the lowland rivers when biological activity is at its highest and this leads to silicon removal from the water column. Quartz equilibrium can be approached (at pH > 5.5) mainly within the upland systems which are not aquifer recharge dominated. However, for the lowland systems that. are groundwater recharge dominated, it is chalcedony saturation which is approached, and such saturation is often observed within groundwaters. Similar patterns of undersaturation in response to biological uptake are seen in lakes and the extent of silicon depletion increases with biological productivity. Chalcedony oversaturation can occur for some UK rivers under baseflow conditions and this probably links to a higher rate of weathering. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An overfilled lacustrine system and progradational delta in Jezero crater, Mars: Implications for Noachian climate	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The presence of valley networks and open-basin lakes in the late Noachian is cited as evidence for overland flow of liquid water and thus a climate on early Mars that might have supported precipitation and runoff. Outstanding questions center on the nature of such a climate, its duration and variability, and its cause. Open basin lakes, their interior morphology, and their associated channels provide evidence to address these questions. We synthesize the extensive knowledge of terrestrial open basin lakes, deltaic environments, and fluvial systems to assess these questions with evidence from Jezero crater, a 45 km diameter open basin lake and its 15,000 km(2) catchment area, similar to 645-km long drainage network, interior sedimentary facies, and similar to 50 km long outlet channel system. We document the presence of extensive scroll bars and epsilon cross-bedding, both indicative of meandering distributary channels that are not observed on alluvial fans but are typical of fluvial-deltaic depositional environments. A fluvial-deltaic environment is further supported by the post-formational erosion of the deltaic complex: the present-day "delta front" is actually an erosional escarpment truncating delta plain features with the clay-rich prodelta environment, predicted from facies models to make up the outer third of the complex, having been largely removed by eolian erosion. The extensive development via lateral accretion of scroll bars and epsilon cross-bedding, and the reconstructed sedimentary architecture suggest a stable baselevel, in contrast to an environment of constantly rising and falling baselevel related to variable input and evaporation that would favor incision during lowstands. The development of the outlet channel is interpreted to have provided baselevel control in the Jezero open-basin lake. The maturity of the outlet channel, in contrast to the catastrophically scoured landscapes typical of dam-breach channels, favors a consistent overfilled hydrology for the paleolacustrine environment. Sediment transport modeling studies of other valley network and related deposits on Mars have suggested durations in the decades to centuries range. We review meander migration rates in terrestrial fluvial environments to provide a comparison for considering the temporal stability implied by the evolution of scroll bars; values of 20-40 years are not uncommon for the structures and migration implied by observations in Jezero. Taking sediment accumulation rates from a variety of terrestrial fluvial-lacustrine environments in conjunction with our estimates of the sedimentary basin-fill thickness suggest timescales of the order of 10(6)-10(7) years, far longer than implied by some sediment transport models, but still a short period of time geologically. The presence of significant residual accommodation space (space available for potential sediment accumulation) in Jezero indicates that sediment transport into the lake terminated before the basin was completely filled. Climate conditions sufficient for sustained overland flow of water in the valley networks are required to fill Jezero crater, to cause its breaching in a non-catastrophic manner, and to form the significant fluvial-deltaic environment of laterally migrating fluvial channels and scroll bars formed with an apparently stable baselevel. The lack of late-stage channel downcutting suggests that the conditions producing overland flow of water into the basin may have ended abruptly. Our estimates of the duration of fluvial activity (of order 10(6)-10(7) years) suggest longer times than previously suggested (years to centuries) by sediment transport models, but generally relatively short durations from a geologic perspective.

Its total surface coverage is 1887 km(2). Its boundary was delineated from 90 m Shutter Radar Terrain Mapping (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) using Global Mapper 8 software. Based on geologic information, unconfined subsurface flow condition was considered and simulated using MODFLOW 2000. The model calibration accounts the matching of the 58 observation point with simulated head with a permissible residual head of +/- 10 m. 75% of the difference between the observed and measured water level head is 5 m. The model was calibrated with mean error 0.506, absolute mean error 4.431 m and standard deviation 6.083 m. Based on the calibration process, the model is very sensitive in decreasing order change in recharge, hydraulic conductivity, and stream bed conductance. The simulated out flow of the model is 205.7 Mm(3)/year which is nearly equal to simulated inflow with difference 2,887.45 m(3)/yr. The base flow simulated discharge Megech River holds 35.8% of the out flow. The river contributed as recharge in to the aquifer that accounts to 15.3% of the inflow. Steady state withdrawal rates were increased by 15%, 35%, 55%, 75% and 100% to study the response of the system in this scenario. From the simulation results, one can observe that the development of a new groundwater sources would not pose appreciable impact in case of 15% and 35% withdrawal the head declines in this case is insignificant relative to the steady state withdrawal rate and the natural discharges were not altered highly. The simulation result indicated that the stream leakage decreased by 7.9% relative to the whole steady state value, but showed 14.9% decrease for Angereb, Keha, and Shinta river segments near the well field area. The water tables decline by 3.6 m to18.8 m in head observation in the well field area. The steady state simulated recharge was decreased by 32% and the simulation results showed on average head decrease of 8.06 m over the whole area; with the highest fall 32 m in wells to north and a minimum of about 1m in wells to the south of the catchment. In addition, the stream leakage, compared to the simulated steady state value and it was decreased by 75.36%. The simulated value showed an average 2.74 m increased head over the whole area. High difference values were observed at Tseda (7.83 m) and Koladiba (7.3 m). The minimum difference 1.08m was recorded at Angereb well field (observation 94). In addition, the stream leakage compared with the steady state value the change was about 87.43%.

The lake is primarily fed by the Chari-Logone river system draining a similar to 600 000 km(2) watershed in tropical Africa. Discharge is strongly controlled by the annual passage of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and monsoon circulation leading to a peak in rainfall during boreal summer. During recent decades, a large number of studies have been carried out in the Lake Chad Basin (LCB). They have mostly focused on a patchwork of exposed lake sediments and outcrops once inhabited by early hominids. A dataset generated from a 673m long geotechnical borehole drilled in 1973, along with outcrop and seismic reflection studies, reveal several hundred metres of Miocene-Pleistocene lacustrine deposits. CHADRILL aims to recover a sedimentary core spanning the Miocene-Pleistocene sediment succession of Lake Chad through deep drilling. This record will provide significant insights into the modulation of orbitally forced changes in northern African hydroclimate under different climate boundary conditions such as high CO2 and absence of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. These investigations will also help unravel both the age and the origin of the lake and its current desert surrounding. The LCB is very rich in early hominid fossils (Australopithecus bahrelghazali; Sahelanthropus tchadensis) of Late Miocene age. Thus, retrieving a sediment core from this basin will provide the most continuous climatic and environmental record with which to compare hominid migrations across northern Africa and has major implications for understanding human evolution. Furthermore, due to its dramatic and episodically changing water levels and associated depositional modes, Lake Chad's sediments resemble maybe an analogue for lake systems that were once present on Mars. Consequently, the study of the subsurface biosphere contained in these sediments has the potential to shed light on microbial biodiversity present in this type of depositional environment. We propose to drill a total of similar to 1800m of poorly to semi-consolidated lacustrine, fluvial, and eolian sediments down to bedrock at a single on-shore site close to the shoreline of present-day Lake Chad. We propose to locate our drilling operations on-shore close to the site where the geotechnical Bol borehole (13 degrees 28'N, 14 degrees 44'E) was drilled in 1973. This is for two main reasons: (1) nowhere else in the Chad Basin do we have such detailed information about the lithologies to be drilled; and (2) the Bol site is close to the depocentre of the Chad Basin and therefore likely to provide the stratigraphically most continuous sequence.

J	Pettigrew, NT; Hattori, KH				Pettigrew, NT; Hattori, KH			Palladium-copper-rich platinum-group element mineralization in Legris Lake mafic-ultramafic complex, Western Superior Province, Canada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION B-APPLIED EARTH SCIENCE					Conference on 21st Century Pt-Pd Deposits held at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Geological Societys Mineral-Deposits-Studies-Group	JAN, 2002	UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND		UNIV SOUTHAMPTON			The Legris Lake Complex is a northeast-trending, 7.3 km x 3.5 km, mafic-ultramafic intrusive complex located in the western Wabigoon Subprovince of the Archaean Superior Province. It is part of a circular series of mafic-ultramafic complexes, the most notable of which is the Lac des Iles Complex, ca 7 km northwest of the Legris Lake Complex, which hosts the Lac des Iles palladium mine. Four phases of exploration have been conducted on the Legris Lake Complex property since autumn, 1999, defining mineralized zones on surface and at depth, with drill-core intersections of up to 2.04 g/t Pd, 0.41 g/t Pt, 0.71 g/t Au, 0.42% Cu and 0.13% Ni over 9.95 m. The Legris Lake Complex consists of mostly gabbroic rocks but also contains lithologies ranging from anorthosite to wehrlite and a variety of igneous breccias. The gabbroic rocks vary from melanogabbro to porphyritic leucogabbro. Medium-grained, massive, biotite-rich leucogabbro is the predominant exposed variety and probably caps the complex. The northwestern margin of the complex (2 km x 600 m), which contains all the known platinum-group element (PGE) mineralization, is characterized by heterolithic breccia with abundant fragments of sedimentary rocks and numerous gabbroic dykes and sills. The PGE mineralization in the Legris Lake Complex has different characteristics from many PGE deposits, where the ore occurs in sulphide-rich bodies at the base of mafic and ultramafic rocks. In the Legris Lake Complex PGE enrichment occurs in sulphide-poor (1-10 vol%, mostly <5 vol%), medium- to coarse-grained, porphyritic leucogabbro (termed 'Main Showing-type') hosted within zones of intense magmatic brecciation. The mineralized leucogabbro is mineralogically highly evolved and exhibits a sill-like form near the stratigraphic top of the complex. The mineralization consists of disseminated to blebby sulphides rimmed by epidote and disseminated magnetite. The mineralized rocks typically contain Cu ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 wt% and Ni from 0.07 to 0.12 wt%, with low Pt/Pd ratios (ca 0.2) and high Cu/Ni ratios (ca 3). The PGE contents display a positive correlation with those of Cu and Ni. The origin of the mineralization is best explained by preferential partitioning of PGE into an immiscible sulphide melt in evolved silicate magma after fractional crystallization of olivine and clinopyroxene. The immiscible separation of sulphide melt may have been aided by incorporation of silica and sulphide from adjacent sedimentary rocks. Formation of magnetite and hydrous minerals in the mineralized zones suggests that the sulphide melt had high oxygen/(oxygen + sulphur) ratios and high contents of volatiles, most probably reflecting a high oxidation state and volatile-rich nature of the parental magmas. This primary magmatic PGE mineralization was followed by minor redistribution of PGE by deuteric hydrothermal fluids released from the parental magma.					; Hattori, Keiko/AFL-0708-2022	Hattori, Keiko/0000-0002-6757-707X; 													0371-7453	1743-2758				JAN-APR	2002	111						B46	B57																WOS:000177753500006
J	Hay, WW				Hay, William W.			Can humans force a return to a 'Cretaceous' climate?	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The modern pole-to-equator sea-level temperature difference is about 50 degrees C; that of the mid-Cretaceous ranged from 30 degrees C to as little as 24 degrees C, implying a much more equable climate. This may have been caused by 1) reduction of the ice-forced albedo of the polar regions, 2) more efficient meridional energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean, and 3) increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Earth's icy polar regions stabilize its present 'inequable' climate through the ice-albedo feedback effect The polar ice results in permanent atmospheric highs that stabilize Earth's wind systems. In turn the stable winds drive the ocean currents and determine the location of the frontal systems that separate the low- and high-latitude oceanic gyre systems and bound the region where water sinks into the ocean interior as thermocline and intermediate water masses. Increased ocean heat transport can assist in making a more equable climate, but unrealistic volume transports would be required to warm the polar regions to Cretaceous levels. The major factor forcing the equable climate of the Cretaceous is now thought to be increased greenhouse gas concentrations, dominated by CO2. The modern rate of change in atmospheric concentration is greater than 200 ppmv per century and increasing. This compares with 1 ppmv per century during the last deglaciation. At current rates of fossil fuel burning, atmospheric CO2 levels will reach Cretaceous levels of 2 times the pre-industrial level about 2070 and 8 times the pre-industrial level shortly after 2300. It is likely that Cretaceous atmospheric CO2 concentrations will last for many thousands to tens of thousands of years. In addition to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, a return to climatic conditions resembling those of the Cretaceous would require ice-free poles and large changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Arctic sea-ice is melting much more rapidly than had been expected, and the Arctic Ocean will soon be free of sea-ice in summer. The Greenland ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected because of greenhouse warming. Surface meltwater forms lakes, and then flows down through crevasses and holes in the ice to lubricate the base, allowing ice steams to flow much more rapidly. The lifetime of the Greenland ice sheet may be only a few hundred years. The West Antarctic ice sheet is inherently unstable, being grounded on rock well below sea level. The ice shelves blocking ice streams off West Antarctica have begun to melt from beneath and break up as the southern ocean warms. The East Antarctic ice sheet has been regarded as highly stable but discovery of lakes beneath the ice and fast-flowing ice streams raises questions about whether the ice sheet will ultimately succumb to global warming and disintegrate. I conclude that a return to climatic conditions resembling those of the mid-Cretaceous is not only possible but also likely unless humanity can organize an effective campaign to stop CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and remove some of the excess CO2 already introduced.

This grouplet was classified as the ''Carlisle Lakes-type'' chondrites (Weisberg et al., 1991). Recently, one Saharan sample and four more Antarctic meteorites were identified to belong to this group (Acfer 217, Y-793575, Y-82002, PCA91002, PCA91241). The latter two are probably paired. With the meteorite Rumuruti, the first fall of this type of chondrite is known (Schulze et al., 1994). We report here on the Saharan meteorite Acfer 217 which has chemical and mineralogical properties very similar to Rumuruti and Carlisle Lakes. All eight members of this group, Rumuruti, Carlisle Lakes, ALH85151, Y-75302, Y-793575, Y-82002, Acfer 217, and the paired samples PCA91002 and PCA91241 justify the introduction of a new group of chondritic meteorites, the Rumuruti meteorites (R). Acfer 217 is a regolith breccia consisting of up to cm-sized clasts (almost-equal-to 33 vol%) embedded in a fine-grained, well-lithified clastic matrix. The most abundant mineral is olivine (almost-equal-to 72 vol%), which has a high Fa-content of 37-39 mol%. The major minerals (olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, Ca-pyroxene, and plagioclase) show some compositional variability indicating a slightly unequilibrated nature of the meteorite. Considering the mean olivine composition of Fa37.8 +/- 5.7, a classification of Acfer 217 as a R3.8 chondrite would result; however, Acfer 217 is a regolith breccia consisting of clasts of various petrologic types. Therefore, we suggest to classify Acfer 217 as a R3-5 chondrite regolith breccia. The bulk meteorite is very weakly shocked (S2). The bulk composition of Acfer 217 and other R-meteorites show that the R-meteorites are basically chondritic in composition. The pattern of moderately volatile elements is unique in R chondrites; Na and Mn are essentially undepleted, similar to ordinary chondrites, while Zn and Se contents are similar to concentrations in CM chondrites. The oxygen isotopic composition in Acfer 217 is similar to that of Rumuruti, Carlisle Lakes, ALH 8515 1, and Y-75302. In a deltaO-17 vs. deltaO-18-diagram, the R-meteorites form a group well resolved from other chondrite groups. Acfer 217 was a meteoroid of common size with a radius between 15-65 cm and with a single stage exposure history. Based on Ne-21, an exposure age of about 35 Ma was calculated.

J	Castro, MS; McLaughlin, EN; Davis, SL; Morgan, RP				Castro, MS; McLaughlin, EN; Davis, SL; Morgan, RP			Total mercury concentrations in lakes and fish of western Maryland, USA	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The purpose of this study was to quantify total mercury concentrations in three species of fish in three lakes of western Maryland: Piney Creek reservoir, Deep Creek Lake, and Lake Habeeb. We measured total mercury concentrations in water from each lake and muscle tissue from 119 fish collected in fall 2000: 15 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), 15 yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and 15 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) from the Piney Creek reservoir; 15 largemouth bass, 15 yellow perch, and 14 bluegill from Deep Creek Lake; and 15 largemouth bass and 15 bluegill from Lake Habeeb. Average total mercury concentrations (+/-SD) in surface waters were 0.96 +/- 0.03 ng L-1 for the Piney Creek reservoir, 0.56 +/- 0.07 ng L-1 for Deep Creek Lake, and 0.40 +/- 0.05 ng L-1 for Lake Habeeb. These water quality differences were sometimes reflected in the total mercury concentration in fish muscle tissue. Total mercury concentrations in bluegill (0.05 +/- 0.02 mug g(-1)) and largemouth bass (0.10 +/- 0.03 mug g(-1)) from Lake Habeeb were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than the total mercury concentrations in bluegill and largemouth bass from the Piney Creek reservoir (bluegill: 0.13 +/- 0.04 mug g(-1) and largemouth bass: 0.37 +/- 0.18 mug g(-1)) and Deep Creek Lake (bluegill: 0.11 +/- 0.04 mug g(-1) and largemouth bass: 0.30 +/- 0.09 mug g(-1)). Yellow perch from the Piney Creek reservoir had significantly higher total mercury concentrations than yellow perch from Deep Creek Lake (0.20 +/- 0.08 mug g(-1) versus 0.13 +/- 0.04 mug g(-1)). In contrast, total mercury concentrations in largemouth bass from the Piney Creek reservoir and Deep Creek Lake were not significantly different. With the exception of largemouth bass from Lake Habeeb and yellow perch from Deep Creek Lake. there were relatively strong (r(2) > 0.39-0.79) log-log relationships between the size (weight and length) of the fish and total mercury concentrations in muscle tissue. The largest largemouth bass (> 800 g and > 38 cm) from both Deep Creek Lake and the Piney Creek reservoir had total mercury concentrations that exceeded the consumption advisory of 0.5 mug g(-1) that is used by many states and Canada. In contrast, total mercury concentrations in largemouth bass from Lake Habeeb did not exceed this consumption advisory. Our results suggest that fish consumption advisories are needed for largemouth bass in the Piney Creek reservoir and Deep Creek Lake.																			0090-4341					MAY	2002	42	4					454	462		10.1007/s00244-001-0039-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-001-0039-9								11994787					WOS:000175176200010
J	Wayland, M; Hobson, KA; Sirois, J				Wayland, M; Hobson, KA; Sirois, J			Environmental contaminants in colonial waterbirds from Great Slave Lake, NWT: spatial, temporal and food-chain considerations	ARCTIC												Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada, differs regionally in trophic status and local and regional inputs of contaminants. Spatial and temporal trends in contaminant levels in bioindicator species such as colonial waterbirds could offer insights into the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation in Great Slave Lake. Persistent chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminants, mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) were examined in herring gull (Laurus argentatus) eggs and livers collected from various locations on Great Slave Lake in 1995. Eggs were collected in May and June, and livers in May and August. Also, the relationship between contaminants and trophic level, as inferred from stable-nitrogen isotope analysis (delta(15)N), was examined in four colonial waterbird species: herring gull, mew gull (L. canus), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), and black tern (Clilidonias niger). Finally, the co-accumulation of mercury and selenium was examined in eggs of these birds. There were no differences in chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations among four sampling sites (colonies). Concentrations did not differ between herring gull adults collected in early May and those collected in early August. Chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations in eggs of herring gull, mew gull, Caspian tern, and black tern were related to their trophic positions as inferred from their delta(15)N values in their lipid-free egg yolks. Concentrations in these colonial waterbirds were much higher than those in fish from Great Slave Lake, but lower than those in their conspecifics from the Great Lakes. It is probable that a relatively large proportion of the chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminant load in colonial waterbird eggs on Great Slave Lake results from exposure to and storage of such contaminants at more heavily contaminated wintering and staging areas. This possibility limits the usefulness of colonial waterbirds as indicators of chlorinated hydrocarbon bioaccumulation in Great Slave Lake. Selenium and mercury concentrations in herring gull eggs differed significantly among the four breeding colonies, and concentrations in adults declined between May and August. Selenium and mercury were positively correlated in eggs of all species.					Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019														0004-0843					SEP	2000	53	3					221	233																WOS:000089687100003

In a search for detailed histories, three kinds of scale are examined. The longer-term development of cultural patterns and boundaries is found to correlate very imprecisely with the character and architecture of settlements. Individual houses and settlements were generally short-lived, suggesting considerable fluidity in social relations at the local level. Greater continuity can be found in the landscape, perhaps involving more than individual communities. We argue that the particular history of the northern Alpine foreland is best understood by interweaving multiple temporal scales, an approach that will need to be extended to other case studies. Les donnees fournies par les habitats neolithiques du nord des Alpes sont a la base d'une enquete cherchant a etablir quelle difference une chronologie de haute precision s'appuyant ici en grande partie sur la dendrochronologie peut-elle faire quand il s'agit d'ecrire l'histoire du Neolithique. Nous examinons trois types d'echelle qui pourraient contribuer a produire des recits plus etoffes. Le developpement sur la longue duree de tendances et de cadres culturels ne semble correspondre qu'approximativement au caractere et a l'architecture des sites d'habitat. En general les maisons et les habitats individuels etaient occupes sur de courtes durees, ce qui indiquerait un large degre de fluidite dans les relations sociales au niveau local. Par contre on observe plus d'elements de continuite dans les campagnes environnantes, ce qui suggererait l'engagement de plusieurs communautes. Nous soutenons que dans le cas du nord de l'arc Alpin l'histoire gagne a etre apprehendee par l'utilisation de plusieurs echelles temporelles mais qu'il faudra etendre cette approche a d'autres etudes de cas.

Am Beispiel der neolithischen Siedlungen des nordlichen Alpenvorlandes wird dargelegt, welchen Einfluss jahresgenaue Chronologien in diesem Fall auf dendrochronologischer Basis auf unsere Interpretationen der neolithischen Gesellschaft haben. Mit dem Ziel, eine detaillierte Vor-Geschichte zu schreiben, werden drei Ebenen beleuchtet. Langzeitentwicklungen kultureller Muster und Grenzen korrelieren nur ungenau mit dem Charakter der Siedlungen und dem Hausbau. Hauser und Siedlungen waren gewohnlich kurzlebig, was auf betrachtliche Flexibilitat der sozialen Beziehungen auf lokaler Ebene hinweist. Mehr Kontinuitat findet sich in der Landschaft oder Siedlungskammer, wobei hier wahrscheinlich mehr als nur eine Siedlungsgemeinschaft involviert war. Die historische Entwicklung im nordlichen Alpenvorland lasst sich allerdings am besten nachzeichnen, wenn die verschiedenen zeitlichen Ebenen miteinander verwoben werden, ein Ansatz, der sich auch auf andere Fallbeispiele ausdehnen lasst.

Geological mapping after the 1983-1985 Rabaul seismic and deformation crisis has partially revealed a long and complex eruption history dominated by numerous explosive eruptions, the largest accompanied by caldera collapse. The oldest exposed eruptives are the basaltic pre-caldera cone Tovanumbatir Lavas K/Ar dated at 0.5 Ma. The dacitic Rabaul Quarry Lavas exposed in the caldera wall and K/Ar dated at 0.19 Ma, are overlain by a sequence of dacitic and andesitic pyroclastic flow and fall deposits. Uplifted coral reef limestones, interbedded within the pyroclastic sequence on the northeast coast, suggest that explosive eruptions in the Rabaul area had commenced prior to the 0.125 Ma last interglacial high sea level stand, The pyroclastic sequence includes the large Boroi Ignimbrites and Malaguna Pyroclastics both 40Ar/39Ar dated at about 0.1 Ma, and the Barge Tunnel Ignimbrite 40Ar/39Ar dated at around 0.04 Ma. Few reliable ages exist for the many younger eruptives, These include Holocene ignimbrites of the latest caldera-forming eruptions - the Raluan Pyroclastics variously dated (C-14) at either about 3500 or 7000 yr B.P., and the ca. 1400 yr B.P. Rabaul Pyroclastics. At least eight intracaldera eruptions have occurred since the 1400 yr B.P. collapse, building small pyroclastic and lava cones within the caldera. A major erosional episode is evident as a widespread unconformity in the upper pyroclastic stratigraphy at Rabaul. Lacking relevant radiometric ages, this episode is assumed to have occurred during last glaciation low sea levels and is here arbitarily dated at ca. ?20 ka. At least five, possibly nine, significant ignimbrite eruptions have occurred at Rabaul during the last ?20 ka. The new eruptive history differs considerably from that previously published, which considered ignimbrite eruption and caldera collapse to have first occurred at 3500 yr B.P. Rabaul volcanism has been dominated by two main types: (a) basaltic and basaltic andesite cone building eruptions; and (b) dacitic, and rarely andesitic or rhyolitic, plinian/ignimbrite eruptions of both high- and low-aspect ratio types. The 1400 yr B.P. Rabaul Ignimbrite is a type example of a low-aspect ratio, high-energy, and potentially very damaging eruption. Fine vitric ash deposits, common in the Rabaul pyroclastic sequence, demonstrate the frequent modification of eruptions by external water probably related to early caldera lakes or bays. Interbedding of these fine ashes with plinian pumice lapilli beds suggests that many early eruptions occurred from multiple vents, located in both wet and dry areas.

Interbedding of these fine ashes with plinian pumice lapilli beds suggests that many early eruptions occurred from multiple vents, located in both wet and dry areas.																			0377-0273	1872-6097				DEC 30	1995	69	3-4					255	284		10.1016/0377-0273(95)00035-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0273(95)00035-6													WOS:A1995TX46900007

The Galileo Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (NIMS) detected extensive deposits of sulfur compounds, elemental sulfur and SO(2) frost on the surface of Io. There are extreme temperature variations on Io's surface - ranging from -130 degreesC to over +2000 degreesC at the Pillan Patera volcanic vent. The active volcanoes, fumaroles, calderas, and lava lakes and vast sulfur deposits on this frozen moon indicate that analogs of sulfur- and sulfate-reducing bacteria might inhabit Io. Hence Io may have great significance to Astrobiology. Earth's life forms that depend on sulfur respiration are members of two domains-Bacteria and Archaea. Two basic links of the biogeochemical sulfur cycle of Earth have been studied: a. the sulfur oxidizing process (occurring at aerobic conditions) and b. the process of sulfur-reduction to hydrogen sulfide (anaerobic conditions). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (StRB) and sulfur-reducing bacteria (SrRB) are responsible for anaerobic reducing processes. At the present time the systematics of StRB include over 112 species distributed into 35 genera of Bacteria and Archaea. Moderately thermophilic and mesophilic SrRB belong to the Bacteria. The hyperthermophilic SrRB predominately belong to the domain Archaea and are included in the genera: Pyrodictium, Thermoproteus, Pyrobaculum, Thermophilum, Desulfurococcus, and Thermodiscus. The StRB and SrRB use a wide spectrum of substrates as electron donors for lithotrophic and heterotrophic type nutrition. The electron acceptors for the StRB include: sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, sulfur, dithionite, tetrathionate, sulfur monoxide, iron, nitrite, selenite, fumarate, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and chlorine-containing phenol compounds. The Sulfate- and Sulfur-reducing bacteria are widely distributed in anaerobic ecosystems, including extreme environments like hot springs, deep-sea hydrothermal vents, soda and high salinity lakes, and cryo-environments. Furthermore, the StRB and SrRB have Astrobiological significance as these anaerobic extremophiles; may represent the dominant relic life forms that inhabited our planet during the extensive volcanic activity in the Earth's early evolutionary period.																			0277-786X		0-8194-4209-7				2001	4495						232	254																WOS:000175125700023

Negative effects of zooplankton on the availability of phosphorus (P) for phytoplankton as a result of the retention of nutrients in zooplankton biomass and the sedimentation of exoskeletal remains after moulting, have been recently proposed. 2. In a mesocosm study, the relative importance of these mechanisms was tested for the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia hyalina x galeata. A total of 13 mesocosm bags was suspended in a mesotrophic German lake during summer 2000 and fertilised with inorganic P in order to obtain a total nitrogen to total P ratio closer to the Redfield ratio. D. hyalina x galeata was then added at a logarithmically scaled density gradient of up to 40 ind. L-1. Zooplankton densities, dissolved inorganic, particulate organic (seston < 100 μm),as well as total nutrient concentrations were monitored. Additionally, nutrient concentrations of sediment water removed from the bottom of the mesocosm bags via a manual pump were determined. 3. Seston carbon (C), seston P and total P were significantly negatively correlated with Daphnia densities. The amount of particulate P (∼5-6 μg P L-1) sequestered from the seston compartment by Daphnia corresponded roughly to the increase of zooplankton biomass ( population growth). Soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) was at all times high (∼25-35 μg P L) 1) and possibly unavailable to phytoplankton as a result of P adsorption to calcite during a calcite precipitation event ( whiting). P concentrations determined in sediment water were generally < 60 mug P m(-2) and thus never exceeded 1% of the total amount of P bound in particulate matter of the overlying water column. 4. Seston C : P ratios followed a polynomial second-order function: At Daphnia densities < 40 ind. L) 1 a positive linear relationship was evident, which is explained by the stronger reduction of P compared with C in seston, and transfer of seston P to zooplankton. Highest seston C : P ratios of ∼ 300 : 1 were observed at Daphnia densities of ∼30-50 ind. L-1, which is in agreement with proposed threshold values limiting Daphnia reproductive growth. At Daphnia densities > 40-50 ind. L-1 C : P ratios were decreased because of the strong reduction of seston C at close to constantly low seston P-values of similar to3-4 mug P L-1. 5. At least for Daphnia, it may be concluded that - unlike population growth - the sedimentation of faecal pellets and carapaces after moulting seem negligible processes in pelagic phosphorus dynamics.																			0046-5070					JAN	2003	48	1					67	74		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00971.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00971.x													WOS:000179693900006
J	Robin, P; Cellier, P; Richard, G				Robin, P; Cellier, P; Richard, G			Theoretical and field comparison of two types of soil heat fluxmeter	SOIL TECHNOLOGY												Accurate measurements of soil heat flux are important for energy balance studies on bare soils. Measurements are usually made with passive transducers that transform the vertical soil heat flux into an e.m.f. Measurement errors or bias result from differences between the calibration coefficients provided by the manufacturer and those determined in the field. These differences result from bad thermal contact between the soil and the fluxmeter and/or changes in soil thermal conductivity. New printed circuit heat fluxmeters are very thin (0.2 mm) and they provide a better thermal contact with the soil because they have an external copper layer instead of an insulating resin. We carried out a theoretical analysis to identify properties of the transducers (geometrical, thermal or electrical) most important for reducing the calibration variability, The transducer thickness was found to reduce the calibration variability due to large soil thermal conductivity variations. Transducer thermal conductivity is also important when the soil thermal conductivity is accurately known. The printed circuit transducers and classical soil heat flux transducers (thermopiles) where then compared in three different soils, a sandy loam, a loamy and a chalky soil under changing climatic conditions in spring. The outputs of both transducers were compared to reference soil heat flux measurements obtained by the heat storage method. The thermopile transducers were more sensitive (4.1 mu V W-1 m(2)) than the printed circuit transducers (1.6 mu V W-1 m(2)). Both transducers gave similar responses when the soil thermal conductivity varied over a narrow range. The total variation of the calibration coefficients of the printed circuit transducer was smaller for all three soils and for days where the soil thermal conductivity varied widely. We conclude that the printed circuit transducers should be used when field calibration is not possible, or when the calibration is not stable following large soil thermal conductivity variations. The experiment also showed that the theory does not completely describe the interaction between calibration coefficients and soil properties. We have therefore developed a new interpretation of the experimental data that Lakes into account the thermal contact between the soil and the transducer. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

B	Mustafic, P; Mrakovcic, M		Berillis, P		Mustafic, Perica; Mrakovcic, Milorad			Biodiversity Status of and Threats to Freshwater Fish of Croatia and Eastern Adriatic Countries	TRENDS IN FISHERIES AND AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Eastern Adriatic countries (ecoregion Dalmatia 419) have a unique array of endemic freshwater fishes. Our knowledge about the diversity of its freshwater fishes is still incomplete, many new species having been described only in recent years. It is widely held that fish biodiversity constitutes a natural resource that is valuable not only economically, but also in terms of culture and aesthetics, science and education. We have reviewed the characteristics of fish biodiversity in the eastern Adriatic countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Montenegro), with a special emphasis on Croatia. Endemic species are found in the river Soca, Istria Mirna River, the region of Lika and in the Krka, Cetina, and Neretva River basins, in the Moraca and Skadar Lake. Usually, a single catchment supports between 6 and 10 species. Out of the 52 European threatened freshwater species, 28% occur in the eastern Adriatic, making this area a hotspot for threatened freshwater fish. Conservation management of these resources should be considered critical by all the governments involved. The area of occupancy of endangered freshwater fish is declining and if this does not change and if the loss of species continues at the current rate, the opportunity to conserve many of the remaining species will vanish. The speciation processes of endemic species started here about 5 million years ago, but the present-day distribution patterns essentially started to be established in the Pleistocene. A special mechanism for surviving drought has evolved in these populations and in general fish in the karstic area have become very hardy; however, negative anthropogenic effects have changed much of this evolution. An overview of endemic behaviour and some examples of patterns that undermine normal existing mitigation measures are provided. Human threats to global freshwater fish biodiversity fall into five categories: over-exploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Combined and interacting influences on fish biodiversity are now generally well known and have been exacerbated by climate change. We believe that knowledge of these threats is insufficiently incorporated into the development of water resources development and requires wider dissemination.																					978-1-68108-580-7; 978-1-68108-581-4				2017							23	41				10.2174/97816810858071170101												WOS:000656498500004

Its hotels and resorts were replaced by large homes and estates by 1860s and its 175km shoreline well developed by 1930s. The lake has a complex morphometry with 26 bays and coves that has created a varying water quality regions and bottom sediment types. The lake and its catchment have been well studied; however, a lake water quality model had been lacking due to the lake's complex morphology. The goals of this project, Lake Minnetonka 3D water quality modeling, were to apply a model robust enough to capture the system's large water quality heterogeneity, conduct sensitivity analysis to increase confidence in the model results, and provide engineering application of the model to aid in management of the lake. We have successfully applied a coupled 3D hydrodynamic (ELCOM) and ecological (CAEDYM) model to a number of bays of Lake Minnetonka, including: parameter calibration and model confirmation (validation), model simulations and the insights gained about the biogeochemical processes, the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses by two methods and the model parameter ranking, and examples of ecological application of the model in Lake Minnetonka. The results reflect a lake system with significant spatial and temporal water quality changes that requires the use of a 3D model. Spatial and temporal dynamics were well simulated and model output results of water temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP) and one group of algae (Cyanobacteria) as represented as chlorophyll a (Chla) compared well with an extensive field data in the bays under two very meteorologically different growing seasons. The model was able to capture water quality variations including significant sudden (days) water quality changes caused by stream inflow events that would not have been otherwise detected by typical summer monitoring. Model simulations indicate that total phosphorus variations in deeper water columns were more likely the consequences of physical perturbations caused by storm events flows. The model captured the heterogeneity of the lake and showed that the use of 3D model along with an accurate bathymetry, and a systematic calibration and confirmation process can help to analyze the hydrodynamics of a morphologically complex lake. Much effort was made in setting up and configuring the model, carrying out calibration, and confirmation. Two sensitivity and uncertainty methods were used to improve understanding of the model, identify influential model parameters, explore spatial and temporal variabilities of model prediction, and to rank 40 of the model parameters. 70% of model output uncertainty was explained by 7 parameters or less. T, DO, TP, and Chla model outputs contributed 3, 13, 26, and 58% to total model variance respectively. Results identified the need for a better understanding of biological model parameters and the need to include bacteria and zooplankton simulations in future work. The spatial and temporal variations of model outputs were found to be sensitive to the hydrodynamics of physical perturbations such as those caused by stream inflows generated from storm events. 3D sensitivity-uncertainty analyses must include periods of physical perturbations. The model has been used to examine and compare the coolwater fish habitat analysis in 3D and under a scenario where spatial heterogeneity has been eliminated by horizontally averaging T and DO. The model is currently used to investigate the relationship between climate change, shoreline plant survival, lake hydrodynamics, lake water level changes, sediment nutrient flux, and water quality.

Trees were classified as to anticipated resistance according to their o.e.p. at the onset of heavy natural invasion by Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. monticolae during the summer of 1959 and 1960. A total of 424 and 544 ponderosa pines were observed in 1959 and 1960, respectively. In 1959, 138 trees or 32.5% were attacked, 98 of them unsuccessfully. Of the 40 trees attacked successfully 33 had an o.e.p. less than 4 atmospheres. Only one out of 34 trees with an o.e.p. less than 4 atmospheres survived the mass attack, while only 7 out of 24 trees which were mass attacked with o.e.p. greater than 4 atmospheres were killed. Due to extreme drought conditions and the high population level of beetles in 1960, a total of 212 trees or 39% were attacked, 74 of them unsuccessfully. From 133 trees with o.e.p. less than 4 atmospheres, 104 succumbed but only 34 trees out of 79 trees with o.e.p. greater than 4 atmospheres were overcome by a mass invasion. Trees of both low and high o.e.p. were initially attacked at the same rate but subsequent mass attack occurred much more frequently in trees with low o.e.p. where the successful establishment of the initial attack appeared to create a mass attraction. Differences in susceptibility due to site and stand conditions among various plots were found to be expressed in the percentage of trees with high and low o.e.p. As a silvicultural practice to prevent bark beetle outbreaks, measurements of the o.e.p. are suggested for risk-rating individual trees as well as stands of second growth ponderosa pine.																									1961	21	2					67	+																WOS:A19619360A00005

Institutional Support of the Implementation of System Approach to Monitoring the Unique System of Lake Baikal	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												We examine some issues related to institutional support of the formation of the state ecological monitoring system for the unique ecological system of Lake Baikal. We provide a rationale for setting up the institute of state-governed ecological monitoring built upon active legislation, characteristics of the uniqueness, ecosystem approach, and upon the scientific support of the creation and accompaniment of ecosystem monitoring. Various institutes for implementation of system approach to monitoring are considered. It is suggested that the approach to assessing permissibility of the kinds of activity should be altered fundamentally by imposing a ban on the use of technologies involving wastes containing harmful substances falling in the category of specially hazardous and highly hazardous for the lake's ecosystem. We have formulated the conditions for updating the list of the kinds of activity banned on the territory of the central ecological zone. A package of investigations has been developed for implementation of the new approach to standardizing impacts on Baikal's ecosystem, implying the scientific substantiation of its response to anthropogenic impacts. An analysis is made of the problems and conflicts in the way of accomplishing governance of the water-economy complex caused by regulation of responsibilities in the sphere of environmental protection. We examine the attitude adopted by agencies and business entities as regards the regulation of recovery of damages done as a result of environmental offence. We suggest some ideas as to the institution of measures within the Federal Target Program of the protection of Baikal, specifically for the operation and construction of pollution control facilities in the central ecological zone of the Baikal natural territory, based on making alterations to the critical target indicators of the Program and establishing priorities of the measures and relevant parameters to be monitored for Lake Baikal. Subsequent to a relevant analysis, we make proposals for the resolution of administrative issues related to formulation and implementation of a system approach to monitoring the lake's ecosystem in view of the gap between the instituted spheres of responsibility of federal agencies and the administrative, financial and human resources available. The proposals can be used for the legal and institutional support of the protection of Baikal, and for the economic development of the Baikal region.

J	THOMPSON, TA				THOMPSON, TA			BEACH-RIDGE DEVELOPMENT AND LAKE-LEVEL VARIATION IN SOUTHERN LAKE-MICHIGAN	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					RESEARCH CONF ON QUATERNARY COASTAL EVOLUTION	MAY 08-11, 1991	WAKULLA SPRINGS, FL	SOC SEDIMENTARY GEOL, INT GEOL CORRELAT PROGRAM				The most accurate source of information on lake-level fluctuations in the Great Lakes is the historical record from lake-level gauges. Although it can be semiquantitatively extended back into the late 1700's, the historical record is too short to recognize long-term patterns of lake-level behavior. To extend the historical record, information must be obtained from the Great Lakes geologic record. Such information includes the elevation and age of geomorphic features and stratigraphic sequences. One of the longest geologic records of late Holocene lake-level variation is preserved in a beach-ridge complex along the southern shore of Lake Michigan called the Toleston Beach. This strandplain contains over 150 beach ridges that arc across northwestern Indiana and fan out into northeastern Illinois. Each ridge was formed during the fall from a high lake level, and the elevation of the foreshore deposits in each ridge provides information on the upper physical limit of lake level over the past 4000 years. Three scales of quasi-periodic lake-level variation were determined by radiocarbon-dating basal peats of wetlands between the ridges and by measuring the elevation of foreshore (swash) deposits within ridges. These three scales are: (1) a short-term and small-scale fluctuation of 25 to 35 years with a range of about 0.5 to 0.6 m; (2) an intermediate-term and meso-scale fluctuation of 140 to 160 years and a range of about 0.8 to 0.9 m; and (3) a long-term and large-scale fluctuation of 500 to 600 years and a range of 1.8 to 3.7 m. The short-term and intermediate-term fluctuations are reflected in the historical record. An increase in the rate of shoreline progradation from east to west across Indiana's shoreline causes differential preservation of the lake-level fluctuations. That is, groups of four to six ridges in the western part of the strandplain that formed in response to the small-scale fluctuations combine eastward into single ridges and groups of ridges representing the meso-scale fluctuations. The large-scale fluctuations produced the most dramatic response in the western part of the Toleston Beach. Here, following each high stand, individual spits prograded southward off of a bedrock headland. The successive spit extensions created several small lakes landward of the spits and started the 20 km eastward stream-mouth deflection of the Grand Calumet River across Indiana's western lakeshore.					; Thompson, Todd/G-6579-2011	Thompson, Todd/0000-0001-6266-2630; 													0037-0738					OCT	1992	80	3-4					305	318		10.1016/0037-0738(92)90048-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(92)90048-V													WOS:A1992KA38600013
J	Sirois, L				Sirois, L			Distribution and dynamics of balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.) at its northern limit in the James Bay area	ECOSCIENCE												A regional assessment of balsam fir distribution along a transect between 49 degrees 30' N and 53 degrees 30' N suggests that balsam fir exists as isolated populations scattered across large expanses of Quebec's boreal forest. At its northern limit, balsam fir is primarily associated with environments that have a low fire frequency, such as the coastal lands along James Bay and the shores of major hinterland water bodies. Detailed mapping of balsam fir populations, stratigraphical study of supporting organic soils, and age-structure data of forest stands around Duncan Lake (53 degrees 30' N, 78 degrees W) constituted the core of the local analysis of balsam fir ecology at its northern limit. The presence of macrofossils in a representative organic soil profile of the spruce-fir forests of the Duncan Lake area suggests that balsam fir is present in the region since 3830 years BP. Its scarcity in the peat profile indicates a low population density during much of the site history. Age-structure analysis indicates the four spruce-fir forests studied in the Duncan Lake area are old-growth, dating back to at least the 17th or 18th centuries. Balsam fir behaves like a late successional species, appearing 100-150 years after black spruce in each site. Layering started during the 19th century, and became the principal means of regeneration for both species during the 20th century. The correlation between age frequency distribution and negative exponential model estimates ranges from 0.57-0.93 For balsam fir, and 0.93-0.95 for black spruce. The distribution of residuals along the regression slope suggests a period of low black spruce recruitment between ca 1860-1930; this was followed by a sharp increase until ca 1970. Balsam fir followed a similar, though delayed, pattern. The results suggest that marginal spruce-fir communities in the Duncan Lake area have experienced accelerated layering during the 20th century. Because few dead fir trees were found in the field, this may represent a long-term increase in fir population densities. Increased snow fall since the turn of the century may have favoured the growth of Sphagnum and the rooting of basal branches; this has resulted in a continuous increase in population density.																			1195-6860						1997	4	3					340	352		10.1080/11956860.1997.11682413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1997.11682413													WOS:A1997XY28700010
J	Vergniolle, S; Bouche, E				Vergniolle, Sylvie; Bouche, Emmanuella			Gas-driven lava lake fluctuations at Erta 'Ale volcano (Ethiopia) revealed by MODIS measurements	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The long-lived lava lake of Erta 'Ale volcano (Ethiopia) is remotely monitored by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) installed on satellites. The Normalised Thermal Index (NTI) (Wright et al. Remote Sens Environ 82:135-155 2002) is shown to be proportional to the volume of the lava lake based on visual observations. The lava lake's variable level can be plausibly related to a stable foam, i.e. a mixture composed of densely packed non-coalescing bubbles in suspension within a liquid. This foam is trapped at the top of the magma reservoir, and its thickness changes in response to the gas flux feeding the foam being successively turned on and off. The temporal evolution of the foam thickness, and the resulting variation of the volume of the lava lake, is calculated numerically by assuming that the gas flux feeding the foam, initially constant and homogeneous since December 9, 2002, is suddenly stopped on December 13, 2002 and not restarted before May 2003. The best fit between the theoretical foam thickness and the level of the lava lake deduced from the NTI provides an estimate of both the reservoir radius, 155-170 m, and the gas flux feeding the foam, 5.5x10(-3) - 7.2x10(-3) m(3) s(-1) when existing. This is in agreement with previous estimates from acoustic measurements (Bouche et al. Earth Planet Sci Lett 295: 37-48 2010). The very good agreement between the theoretical foam thickness and that deduced from MODIS data shows for the first time the existence of a regime based on the behaviour of a stable foam, whose spreading towards the conduit ("wide" conduit condition), can explain the long-lived activity. Our predictive model, which links the gas flux at the vent to the foam spreading, could potentially be used on any volcano with a long-lived activity. The underlying gas flux and the horizontal surface area of the magma reservoir can then be deduced by combining modelling to continuous measurements of gas flux. The lava lake, when high, often shows regular rise and fall of its level. We have recognised a minimum of 26 very well marked cycles between January 2001 and December 13, 2002, corresponding to a typical return time of 10.8 +/- 2.3 days and a gas volume of 8.3x10(5) +/- 2.0x10(5) m(3). This corresponds to a gas volume fraction in the reservoir equal to 0.023-0.063 %. The yearly gas flux, estimated between December 13, 2002 and September 27, 2004, varies between 2.3x10(-6) and 5.9x10(-6) m(3) s(-1) at the depth of the reservoir. The long-time series provided by infra-red sensors mounted on satellites could be used on any persistent volcano to detect potential periodic variations in the level of lava lakes or lava columns, providing that the vent has a funnel shape, as often, and is sufficiently large.

J	Green, RG; Larson, CL; Bell, JF				Green, RG; Larson, CL; Bell, JF			Shock disease as the cause of the periodic decimation of the snowshoe hare	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYGIENE												The Minnesota Wildlife Disease Investigation has systematically followed the rise and fall of the snowshoe hare population in Minnesota from 1928 to 1938. A census of the hares on the Lake Alexander area was taken each year during the latter phases of the increase and the entire period of decline. The population reached its height in 1933, at which time the census showed 478 hares to the sq. mile. During the next 5 yrs. the number of hares on the area decreased, reaching the low point of 32 per sq. mile in 1938; a similar decline was evident throughout the range of this species in Minnesota. Inasmuch as the normal rate of reproduction was maintained throughout the period of decimation, the diminution in numbers must have been due to an increased rate of mortality. The distribution of parasites among the hares and the degree of individual infestation indicated that neither helminth nor arthropod parasites were an immediate factor of mortality. The only infectious disease commonly found was tularemia, and it was determined to be generally nonfatal in hares naturally infected. No previously known disease of hares seems to be a cause of the die-off. During the period of decline the hares on the Lake Alexander area, and throughout Minnesota in general, became unable to survive for more than a short time when held in captivity, and many died in live-traps almost immediately after they were caught. They appeared to be abnormal, suffering from a condition that caused them to succumb when subjected to stress. This condition, termed shock disease, is characterized by a peculiar type of degeneration of the liver, a failure of the storage of glycogen in that organ, and a terminal development of an abnormally low blood-sugar or hypoglycemia. The immediate cause of death is usually hypoglycemic shock. Shock disease produced some mortality in the Lake Alexander area as early as 1932, and subsequently it prevailed in epizootic proportions among snowshoe hares throughout Minnesota. The disease produced a definite loss in weight, afflicted hares of all ages, and had an equal incidence in [male][male] and [female][female].																			0096-5294					JUL-NOV	1939	30	1/3	B				83	102		10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118584													WOS:000202601100010

The waters in the study district have been grouped into three hydrochemical facies: Facies 1, potable spring-water, is a pH neutral (7.0), NaCa-HCO3 type water with low total dissolved solids (TDS; 0.2 g/l, fresh) and has delta O-18 of -8.3 parts per thousand, delta D of -48.2 parts per thousand, delta B-11 of 1.5 parts per thousand, and Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.70627. Facies 2 groundwaters are mildly acidic to mildly alkaline (pH of 6.5-8.0, mean 7.3), Na-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 type waters with moderate TDS (8.2 g/l-17.2 g/l, mean 9.3 g/l, brackish) and have delta O-18 values in the - 5.8 parts per thousand to - 9.3 parts per thousand range (mean - 8.1 parts per thousand), delta D values in the - 20.8 parts per thousand to - 85.5 parts per thousand range (mean - 47.0 parts per thousand),delta B-11 values in the + 9.5 parts per thousand to + 39.1 parts per thousand range (mean + 17.1 parts per thousand), and Sr-87/Sr-86 values in the 0.70595 to 0.70975 range (mean 0.70826). Facies 3, Aiting Lake water, is a mildly alkaline (pH=7.4), Na-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 type water with the highest TDS (249.1 g/l, brine) and has 6180 of -2.8 parts per thousand, delta D of -45.8 parts per thousand,delta B-11 of 21.2 parts per thousand, and Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.70840. The waters from the study district show a systematic increase in major, trace element and TDS concentrations and delta B-11 values along the pathway of groundwater migration which can only be interpreted in terms of water-rock interaction at depth and strong surface evaporation. The hydrochemical and isotopic data presented here confirm that the groundwaters in the Shihongtan ore district are the combined result of migration, water-rock interaction and mixing of meteoric water with connate waters contained in sediments.

J	Hedenquist, JW; Taran, YA				Hedenquist, Jeffrey W.; Taran, Yuri A.			Modeling the Formation of Advanced Argillic Lithocaps: Volcanic Vapor Condensation Above Porphyry Intrusions	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												Hypogene advanced argillic alteration, typically quartz-alunite with halos of kaolinite +/- dickite and roots of pyrophyllite +/- diaspore, forms in the epithermal environment from condensates of magmatic vapor that contain SO2 and HCl, which exsolved from an underlying intrusive source. The most aggressive, nearly isochemical leaching of the host rock by the most acidic condensate, commonly pH similar to 1, leaves residual silica that recrystallizes to quartz within the flow channel at a high condensate/rock ratio, forming the core of alteration. The alteration characteristically flares upward along feeder structures, and if a permeable lithologic unit is intersected, the alteration zones mushroom to form a subhorizontal blanket due to lateral flow. Where subsequently mineralized, the residual quartz, commonly with a v-uggy texture that reflects the texture of the original lithology, has higher Au (and Cu) grades than the quartz-alunite halo. Tonnage in these high sulfldation systems may develop within the subhorizontal lithocap, although the highest grades are typically confined to the structurally controlled feeders. We modeled a typical volcanic vapor condensate, starting with the measured composition of <= 877 degrees C fumaroles from Satsuma Iwojima rhyolite dome, Japan, as it cooled and reacted with a host rhyolite; the predicted hydrothermal mineralogy reproduces the alteration pattern observed in lithocaps that host high sulfidation deposits. The modeling confirms that aluminum-rich minerals (pyrophyllite, diaspore, locally andalusite) are stable at higher temperature at depth, whereas at lower temperature and shallower depth, Na and K alunite become stable. At the lowest temperature (<200 degrees C), the alunite dissolves, leaving residual silica at high condensate/rock ratios (>10:1), and where SO2 >> H2S in the original volcanic vapor; this SO2-dominant composition is typical of andesitic to rhyolitic volcanoes. The reason for this mineral transition, and the upward flare (widening) of the alteration zone along structures, is related to the dissociation and increased reactivity of H2SO4 and HCl as the temperature decreases. Below similar to 200 degrees C, only quartz, pyrite, native S, and anhydrite are stable, hence the formation of the dominant quartz from the silica residue. A further check on our modeling is the observation that the calculated composition of the condensate after reaction with fresh Satsuma Iwojima rhyolite and alteration minerals, and cooling to 100 degrees C, is similar (within a factor of two) to that of acidic springs, with pH similar to 1, that discharge around Satsuma Iwojima and other active volcanoes. The most extensive lithocap alteration, residual quartz and/or quartz-alunite, is commonly offset from the surface projection of the causative intrusion. This observation can be explained by a combination of two factors-hydrology and temperature. Due to hydraulic gradients at shallow depths in a volcanic edifice, the acidic condensate tends to flow along permeable lithologic units away from the locus of the high-temperature vapor plume, which rises directly over the intrusion. Where lateral flow occurs, the most intense leaching and widespread advanced argillic alteration, which develops largely at temperatures of <200 degrees to 250 degrees C based on our modeling, will form away from the near-surface projection of the intrusion, which is the area of highest surface temperature due to ascent of the vapor plume. This potential for lithocap alteration to form on the shoulder of the underlying causative intrusion must be assessed when exploring for high sulfldation ore; the highest ore grades are commonly related to structures that are proximal to the parent intrusion, but they are unlikely to lie directly over the intrusion. In addition, identifying the most likely location of the source intrusion will help the explorer to efficiently assess any potential for deeper porphyry-style mineralization.

J	Haupt, F; Stockenreiter, M; Boersma, M; Stibor, H				Haupt, Florian; Stockenreiter, Maria; Boersma, Maarten; Stibor, Herwig			Initial size structure of natural phytoplankton communities determines the response to Daphnia diel vertical migration	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a common behavior of many pelagic herbivorous zooplankton species in response to predation pressure. It is characterized by a twice daily habitat shift of the zooplankton species: staying in the epilimnion only during night time and migrating down in the crack of dawn in deeper water layers, staying there during the day time. This causes a discontinuous grazing regime and previous studies have shown that the direction and strength of phytoplankton community responses to zooplankton DVM most probably depends on the size of phytoplankton species. To examine the influence of zooplankton DVM on different sized phytoplankton communities, we designed an experiment where we manipulated the size distribution of a natural phytoplankton community a priori in field mesocosms. We investigated the influence of DVM of the cladoceran Daphnia hyalina on two different phytoplankton communities, by the use of deep (10 m) field enclosures. Epilimnetic lake water, containing a summer phytoplankton community, was filtered with two different mesh sizes (11 mu m and 64 mu m). The 11 mu m phytoplankton community ("small") contained mainly small algal species, while the 64 mu m community ("large") had a wider range of phytoplankton sizes. To simulate zooplankton DVM, D. hyalina were placed in mesh cages that were lowered or raised ("migration") as dictated by the study design; a "no migration" (representing absence of DVM) treatment was also tested. Phytoplankton abundance was measured using chlorophyll-a and biovolume; size distribution of the algae and nutrient availability was also determined in each treatment. The results indicated that DVM had contrasting effects on the two evaluated phytoplankton communities. Comparison of "migration'' and "no migration" zooplankton treatments showed that nutrient availability and total phytoplankton biovolume was higher in (I) "no migration" treatments with phytoplankton communities comprising mainly small algae and (2) "migration" treatments with phytoplankton communities of a broader size spectrum of algae. Hence our study showed two different mechanisms of zooplankton DVM may influence the phytoplankton community dynamics. Nutrient cycling was an important factor in phytoplankton communities of mainly small algae, whereas the refuge effect was the main driver of phytoplankton dynamics in phytoplankton communities of a large size spectrum of algae					Stockenreiter, Maria/MFI-9292-2025; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013	Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X													1129-5767	1723-8633					2012	71	1					125	134		10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e13	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e13													WOS:000303943400013

Cores PALB 94 1E and PALB 94 1C from Site 1, located at the bottom of a steep slope at 70 m water depth, where oxygen concentration is below 6 mg l(-1), spans the Holocene and the late Pleistocene until 28 kyr B. P. (calibrated age). The other cores, PALB 94 6A and PALB 94 6B taken at a depth of 30 m, where oxygen is 7-11 mg l(-1), represent mainly Pleistocene deposits. Ostracod valves were found in the lowermost ca. 3 m of the sequence at Site 1, dated to ca. 28-24 kyr B. P., and throughout the sequence from Site 6 which represents the interval 23-17 kyr B. P. Candona neglecta is the dominant species in most of the levels at Site 1, whereas both C. neglecta and Cyclocypris sp. dominate during different biostratigraphic zones at Site 6. The influx of springs entering the lake at Site 1 was inferred on the basis of species of the genus Potamocypris and Ilyocypris bradyi present in the record. Wide fluctuations in species abundance and assemblages in both coring sites indicate lake-water level oscillations between 28 to 17 kyr B. P. In particular, a strong rise in water level of the order of 40 m occurred between 24 and 23 kyr B. P. Fluctuations in productivity, oxygen availability and water temperature at both sites were also reconstructed on the basis of the ostracod assemblages and the algal and bacterial pigment concentrations. The environmental reconstruction reached using ostracod remains and pigments was verified with other proxy records published elsewhere such as invertebrate remains, diatoms, magnetic properties, etc. A synthesis of climatic reconstructions for Central and Southern Italy for the late Full Glacial is attempted on the basis of previous studies on hydrology, lithostratigraphy and palynology. Sharp fluctuations in lake palaeoproductivity/palaeoclimate recorded by invertebrate and pigment remains at both sites from Lago di Albano might be related to similar events reported in North Atlantic Full-Glacial records from marine and ice cores.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			TEMPERATURE-INDUCED CHANGES IN THE LIFE-CYCLE OF LEUCTRA-NIGRA (PLECOPTERA, LEUCTRIDAE) FROM A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The life cycle of Leuctra nigra (Olivier) took 2 years in a small stream in the English Lake District [UK] and the exponential growth of the larvae was scarcely affected by variations in water temperature (range 4.2-14.0.degree. C). Mean growth rates for three year-classes were 0.43 .+-. 0.01, 0.42 .+-. 0.01, 0.39 .+-. 0.05% body length day-1. There were thirteen or fourteen larval instars for males and fourteen or fifteen for females. The ratio between successive instars was a constant 1.20 (conformed with Dyar''s rule). 2. Larval growth and mortality were exponential at six constant temperatures (5.9, 8.2, 12.1, 15.8, 18.2, 19.8.degree. C) in the laboratory. Mean growth rates (% body length day-1) increased directly with temperature from 0.37 (5.9.degree. C) to 0.55 (19.8.degree. C). Mean mortality rates (% day-1) increased directly with temperature from 0.20 (5.9.degree. C) to 0.26 (12.1.degree. C) and then markedly increased to 0.54-0.58 at the three higher temperatures. Only 7-10% of animals completed their life cycle at the three higher temperatures compared with 23-27% at the three lower temperatures. Egg production also decreased considerably at the higher temperatures. 3. As growth rates in the stream and laboratory were similar at similar temperatures (< 14.degree. C), the optimum conditions for growth in the laboratory were probably similar to those in the stream; therefore resources such as food and space were not restricting growth in the stream. 4. The implications of the temperature-induced changes in growth and mortality are discussed and it is concluded that although the life cycle can change from semivoltine to univoltine with increasing temperature, the costs of a univoltine life cycle are high in terms of survival and egg production, both of which decreased markedly between 12.1 and 15.8.degree. C. Therefore the optimum habitat for this species appears to be a summer cool stream (maximum temperature < 14.degree. C) and the optimal life cycle appears to be about 2 years from egg to adult.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1987	18	1					177	184		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01305.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01305.x													WOS:A1987J392100015
J	Palmer, HC; MacDonald, WD; Gromme, CS; Ellwood, BB				Palmer, HC; MacDonald, WD; Gromme, CS; Ellwood, BB			Magnetic properties and emplacement of the Bishop tuff, California	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and characteristic remanence were measured for 45 sites in the 0.76 Ma Bishop tuff, eastern California. Thirty-three sites were sampled in three stratigraphic sections, two in Owens gorge south of Long Valley caldera, and the third in the Adobe lobe north of Long Valley. The remaining 12 sites are widely distributed, but of limited stratigraphic extent. Weakly indurated, highly porous to dense, welded ash-flow tuffs were sampled. Saturation magnetization vs temperature experiments indicate two principal iron oxide phases: low Ti magnetites with 525-570 degrees C Curie temperatures, and maghemite with 610 degrees-640 degrees C Curie temperatures. AF demagnetization spectra of isothermal remanent magnetizations are indicative of magnetite/maghemite predominantly in the multidomain to pseudo-single domain size ranges. Remeasurement of AMS after application of saturating direct fields indicates that randomly oriented single-domain grains are also present. The degree of anisotropy is only a few percent, typical of tuffs. The AMS ellipsoids are oblate with K-min axes normal to subhorizontal foliation and K-max axes regionally aligned with published source vents. For 12 of 16 locality means, K-max axes plunge sourceward, confirming previous observations regarding flow sense. Topographic control on flow emplacement is indicated by the distribution of tuff deposits and by flow directions inferred from K-max axes. Deposition east of the Benton range occurred by flow around the south end of the range and through two gaps (Benton notch and Chidago gap). Flow down Mammoth pass of the Sierra Nevada is also evident. At least some of the Adobe lobe in the northeast flowed around the west end of Glass mountain. Eastward flow directions in the upper Owens gorge and southeast directions in the lower Owens gorge are parallel to the present canyon, suggesting that the present drainage has been established along the pre-Bishop paleodrainage. Characteristic remanence directions from 45 sites (267 samples) yield an overall mean of D = 348 degrees, I = 53 degrees for the Bishop tuff. A correlation is found in two of the three profiles between density and remanence inclination. A mean remanence direction based on 13 localities together with data from uncompacted xenoliths and data from the ash-fall tuff at Lake Tecopa is: D = 353 degrees, I = 54 degrees, k = 172, alpha(95) = 2.9 degrees, N = 15.																			0258-8900					OCT	1996	58	2-3					101	116		10.1007/s004450050129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004450050129													WOS:A1996VQ52400002
J	Heiri, O; Wick, L; van Leeuwen, JFN; van der Knaap, WO; Lotter, AF				Heiri, O; Wick, L; van Leeuwen, JFN; van der Knaap, WO; Lotter, AF			Holocene tree immigration and the chironomid fauna of a small Swiss subalpine lake (Hinterburgsee, 1515 m asl)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Early Holocene reforestation by stone pine (Pinus cembra) and tree birch (Betula pubescens) took place ca. 500 years after the end of the Younger Dryas at Hinterburgsee, a small subalpine lake in the northern Swiss Alps. During the next ca. 3000 years the local vegetation consisted of open woodlands with many pioneer dwarf shrubs and herbs. The expansion of silver fir (Abies alba) at ca. 7400 calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal. BP) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) at ca. 6000 cal. BP in Hinterburgsee's catchment led to a closing of the local forests with a successive decrease in erosion and a distinct change in Hinterburgsee's sediment composition. First signs of probably human-induced openings of the catchment forest are apparent at ca. 2500 cal. 13P, but it is not until the past ca. 800 years that pollen analysis suggests strong local and regional anthropogenic activity. The strongest and most abrupt changes in the Holocene development of Hinterburgsee's chironomid fauna took place at ca. 11500 cal. BP and at ca. 10 000 cal. BP, when parts of the alpine taxa that were dominant during the Younger Dryas disappeared from the lake. The first change is most likely related to the increasing temperatures after the end of the Younger Dryas, the second possibly to decreasing lake depth and increasing summer insolation in the early Holocene that may have led to warmer bottom water temperatures in the lake. No clear relationship between the changes in catchment vegetation and the development of the chironomid fauna was found. Possibly the increase in sediment organic matter associated with the denser catchment forests was responsible for a succession in the chironomid stratigraphy between 7000 and 4500 cal. BP. However, due to the high sedimentation rates in Hinterburgsee this trend could also be a consequence of, or be promoted by, the sediment infilling of the lake basin. This conjecture is supported by the increasing importance of Tanytarsus lugens-type, a chironomid taxon dominant in the extant chironomid assemblages of shallow mountain lakes in Switzerland. The only shift in the chironomid fauna that clearly parallels a change in catchment vegetation is found during the past ca. 800 years. We discuss possible reasons for the comparatively weak influence of catchment vegetation on the chironomid fauna of Hinterburgsee and the implications of our results for multi-proxy studies on past climate involving both palaeobotanical and chironomid-based reconstructions.

Lithium is primarily found in pegmatites, hydrothermally altered tuffaceous clays, and continental brines. Globally, groundwater-fed salt lakes and oil field brines are attracting attention as major sources of lithium in continental brines, accounting for about 70% of global lithium production. Recently, deep groundwater, especially geothermal water, is also studied for a potential source of lithium. Lithium concentrations in deep groundwater can increase through substantial water-rock reaction and mixing with brines. For the exploration of lithim in deep groundwater, it is important to understand its origin and behavior. Therefore, based on a nationwide preliminary study on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and evolution of thermal groundwater in South Korea, this study aims to investigate the distribution of lithium in the deep groundwater environment and understand the geochemical factors that affect its concentration. A total of 555 thermal groundwater samples were classified into five hydrochemical types showing distinct hydrogeochemical evolution. To investigate the enrichment mechanism, samples (n = 56) with lithium concentrations exceeding the 90th percentile (0.94 mg/L) were studied in detail. Lithium concentrations varied depending upon the type, with Na(Ca)-Cl type being the highest, followed by Ca(Na)-SO4 type and low-pH Ca(Na)-HCO3 type. In the Ca(Na)-Cl type, lithium enrichment is due to reverse cation exchange due to seawater intrusion. The enrichment of dissolved lithium in the Ca(Na)-SO4 type groundwater occurring in Cretaceous volcanic sedimentary basins is related to the occurrence of hydrothermally altered clay minerals and volcanic activities, while enriched lithium in the low-pH Ca(Na)-HCO3 type groundwater is due to enhanced weathering of basement rocks by ascending deep CO2. This reconnaissance geochemical study provides valuable insights into hydrogeochemical evolution and economic lithium exploration in deep geologic environments.

Hydrology, sediment transport and water resources of Ammassalik Island, SE Greenland	GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												A review and a synthesis of results from previous investigations are presented. New studies and results from the Mittivakkat Glacier catchment are used in an attempt to upscale results to other catchments on Ammassalik Island, SE Greenland. A snow-evolution modelling system. SnowModel, together with the hydrological model: NAM were used to simulate the water balance components for periods when direct measurements were not possible. The total annual precipitation (TAP) was 1,500 mm w.eq. y(-1) (1999-2006) for the whole Mittivakkat Glacier catchment, and 984 mm w.eq. y(-1) (1961-1990) uncorrected at the meteorological station in Tasiilaq (Ammassalik). The solid precipitation was 67.85% of the annual precipitation. Evapotranspiration was 250 mm w.eq. y(-1) sublimation during winter time was found to be 200 mm w.eq. y(-1) or 12% of the annual precipitation. The Mittivakkat Glacier has a negative mass balance in 9 out of 11 years (1995-2006); the average annual net loss was 700 mm w.eq. y(-1). This is the dominant change in storage in the area. Runoff from the Mittivakkat catchment was 1,970 mm w.eq. y(-1), the highl values are due to the negative mass balance of the glacier. Catchments without glaciers will have runoff values of approximately 1,200-1,400 mm w.eq. y(-1). Excess runoff due to the negative net balance from glaciers on the island is approximately 81* 10(6) m(3) or 120 mm w.eq. y(-1) from the whole island. The annual sediment yield from the Mittivakkat Glacier catchment is about 1,000 l km(-2) y(-1). Bed load is approximately 20% and suspended load is approximately 80% of the total sediment load. The dissolved load or yield is equivalent to 50 l km(-2) y(-1). Catchments without glaciers or with a large percentage of lakes will have sediment yields of around 10-50 l km(-2) y(-1) depending on surface material and slope. It is shown that the Mittivakkat Glacier is delivering approximately 30% of the total estimated sediment delivery from Ammassalik Island. Water supply for drinking purpose is plentiful. The water supply for the current hydro power production plant is sufficient to cover the present consumption, although about 10% of the flow stems from negative glacier net balance and flows could therefore change in the future.

J	MOMOT, WT; GOWING, H; JONES, PD				MOMOT, WT; GOWING, H; JONES, PD			DYNAMICS OF CRAYFISH AND THEIR ROLE IN ECOSYSTEMS	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												In many lakes crayfish dominate the annual production of the benthic biomass, at times reaching mean biomass values of 1000-1400 kg/ha and numerical densities of 15/m2. Density determines the growth rate of various populations and the reproductive capacity, age at maturity and life span. For Orconectes virilis, within the lakes studied, population stability was mostly due to the short lag between a change in population density and an adjustment in fecundity. As a result, these populations appear to be self-regulated through density-dependent control of brood stock size. In O. virilis, annual production was a function of mean annual biomass. Examination of available data on the ratio between other species showed them to fall within the same range as O. virilis. The evolutionary strategy governing crayfish biomass replacement and energy turnover apparently has remained essentially unchanged. As regards their role in the community, crayfish do not fit the trophic level concept. Attempts to quantify their food habits show them to be polytrophic and a key energy transformer between various trophic links through utilization of all the trophic levels in lakes. Because of the multiple trophic roles of the crayfish, a comparison with all the bioenergetics of various freshwater crustacea is difficult. Crayfish may be most important in lakes with low phytoplankton production. In such lakes detritus and benthic algae, both of with are ingested by the crayfish, are important sources of overall energy flow. Since crayfish also function as major predators on the benthos, they most likely contribute to the stability of lake communities by interacting with a whole subweb of species ranging from large benthic invertebrates and sumberged higher aquatics to the periphytic microcommunity. Crayfish act as an important mechanism contributing to the regulation of most production processes and, most specifically, to the regulation of benthic production available to fish. In low nutrient lakes, because of their biomass dominance and functional role, crayfish greatly surpass the usual role assigned to them from their occurrence in fish diets. Manipulation of the benthic food chain would seem to be the most appropriate strategy to increase the fish production of such lakes. A greater appreciation of the complexity of the trophic organization of such food webs is necessary before such modifications can be attempted.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1978	99	1					10	35		10.2307/2424930	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424930													WOS:A1978EV04600002

Integration of tectonic, sedimentary, and geohydrologic processes leading to a small-scale extension model for the Mormon Mountains area north of Lake Mead, Lincoln County, Nevada	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Scattered remnants of highly diverse stratigraphic sections of Tertiary lacustrine limestone, andesite flows, and 23.8-18.2 Ma regional ash-flow tuffs on the north flank of the Mormon Mountains record previously unrecognized deformation, which we interpret as pre-17 Ma uplift and possibly weak extension on the north flank of a growing dome. Directly to the north of the Mormon dome, 17-14 Ma ash-flow tuffs and rhyolite are interstratified with landslides, debris avalanches, debris flows, and alluvial-fan deposits that accumulated to a thickness of more than 2 km in an extension-parallel basin. The source for the landslides and debris avalanche deposits is unknown, but it was probably an adjacent scarp along a transverse fault bounding an early part of the Mormon dome. An average 45 degrees of easterly tilt of the entire Tertiary basin-fill succession represents the major post-14 Ma deformation event in the region. We question the basis for the published estimate of 22 km of westerly displacement on the Mormon Peak detachment fault and, on the basis of landslides in the upper plate having a probable source in the adjacent Mormon dome, constrain the heave to similar to 4 km. We interpret the dome and basin as coupled strains similar to others in the region and suggest that these strains reflect a waveform pattern of extension-normal lateral midcrustal ductile flow. Previously, doming was interpreted as an isostatic response to tectonic unloading by large-displacement detachment faults or as pseudo-structural highs stranded by removal of middle crust from adjacent areas. Moreover, we argue that the strong thinning of upper-plate rock successions throughout the Mormon Mountains and Tule Springs Hills resulted from a loss of rock volume by protracted fluid flow, dissolution, and collapse, seriously limiting the usefulness of upper-plate strain in evaluating extension magnitude. We present a geohydrologic model that couples uplift driven by ductile inflow with dissolution driven by fluid infiltration, possibly augmented by mantle-derived CO2-rich fluids. Karsting in the uplands led to carbonate sedimentation in adjacent lowlands. Whether or not our downward revision of extension in the Mormon Mountains is valid, extension at that latitude is isolated from extension in the Lake Mead area by a low-strain corridor between the two areas. Recognition of the isolated and potentially diminished strain impacts estimates of maximum finite elongation of the Basin and Range Province because one of three vector paths used in those estimates passes through the Mormon Mountains.

J	Green, TS; Memon, BA; Patton, AF; Pitts, MW				Green, TS; Memon, BA; Patton, AF; Pitts, MW			Design and costs for a system to reduce chloride levels in the Red River by shallow-well collection and deep-well disposal	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The Red River drains 242000 km(2) with of this area being downstream of discharges naturally occurring brine seeps and springs. The upstream area has been designated as a major ide emission area in Texas and Oklahoma. Ten major brine source emission areas along the tributaries to the Red River were identified by U.S. Public Health Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Eight of these areas were deemed suitable re control of brine emissions by structural ods including a ring dike to enclose brine gs; low flow dams to capture and divert stream flows with high chloride content to evaporation lakes; and shallow aquifer brine collection with a deep-well disposal system. Two adjacent emission areas, designated as Areas XIII and contribute 500 metric tons of salt per day to the Red River. These areas, along Jonah Creek and,reek, tributaries to the Prairie Dog Town of the Red River were selected for investigation to control brine emission by utilization of shallow collection wells and disposal by deep injection wells. Drilling programs and pumping tests performed to determine the number and location of shallow collection wells. Eighteen wells with 12 operating full time, will be located in the primary emission areas. The collected brine will be coni through corrosion-resistant pipelines to a treatment facility for filtration at a rate of 300 l/s. Additional pipelines will convey the filtered brine ep injection wells for disposal. Nine deep wells be installed with seven operating full time. Design criteria for the project are 100-year life expectancy and automated operation with minimum supervision and maintenance. The required minimum operating, maintenance and supervision coupled 100-year life expectancy of the project added significantly to the estimated US $58 million capital cost of the project. However, the reduction in annual cost for labor, repairs and replacement of the component of the system should result in a lower life cycle cost. The estimated annual operating and maintenance cost is US $4.7 million.																			0943-0105					JUL	1999	38	2					141	148		10.1007/s002540050409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002540050409													WOS:000081856000005

The main aims of the study were to reconstruct water temperature as a signal of climate change during the last glacial termination, compare the aquatic and terrestrial response to the changing climate, and place our findings into a climatic frame on the northern hemispheric scale. A calibration data set (ALPS06) of 116 lakes was constructed using data from newly studied lakes and from two previously published data sets and we established a transfer function for predicting summer epilimnetic water temperatures (SEWT). A locally weighted weighted average regression and calibration model (R (jack) (2) = 0.89; RSMEP = 1.82A degrees C) was applied to the fossil diatom assemblages in order to reconstruct SEWT. Three major sections were distinguished in the time window of approximately 19-13 cal ka BP, which fitted well with the oxygen isotope curve and the isotope-event stratigraphy from the Greenland ice-core GRIP. The first section was a warming period (SEWT range from 11.6 to 18.0A degrees C; average 15.8A degrees C = ca. 6A degrees C below present) called the Langsee oscillation, which probably correlates with the warmer sub-section (GS-2b) of the Greenland Stadial 2. The subsequent section represents a climate cooling, called the Langsee cold period (SEWT range between 10.6 and 15.9A degrees C; average 12.9A degrees C), which probably corresponds with the sub-section GS-2a of the Greenland Stadial 2, the Heinrich 1 cold event of the North Atlantic, and partially the Gschnitz Stadial in the Alps. The Langsee cold period shows a tri-partition: Two colder phases are separated by a warmer inter-phase. The passive ordination of the core sample scores along maximum water depth indicated that the Langsee cold period was drier than the Langsee oscillation. Strong short-term fluctuations during the Langsee oscillation and the Langsee cold period indicate climate instability. The third section represented climate warming during the Langsee late glacial interstadial (=Greenland Interstadial 1, GI-1) with an average SEWT of 17.5A degrees C. From the minor climatic fluctuations during this interstadial, mainly indicated by pollen, the fluctuation most likely related to the Gerzensee oscillation showed a SEWT decline. During the early immigration and expansion period of shrubs and trees, aquatic and terrestrial records showed distinct discrepancies that might have arose because of time lags in response and differences in sensitivity.

Douglas; Weaver, Barry L.; Dulin, Shannon; Jackson, Jacob			Paleomagnetic and petrologic study of the age, origin, and significance of early and late Paleozoic events in the Long Mountain Granite, Wichita Mountains, Oklahoma	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Cambrian Long Mountain Granite, exposed in the western Wichita Mountains, Oklahoma, is red, granophyric, alkali feldspar granite. The red granite abruptly transitions into a green granite in the subsurface; both red and green granites have similar geochemical signatures. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis shows that the green granite retains a primary magnetic fabric that is consistent with the sill-like emplacement of the Wichita Granite Group. Demagnetization of green granite specimens yields a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) residing in magnetite with east declinations and moderate down inclinations. The paleopole (9.0 degrees N, 314.6 degrees E) is interpreted as a primary Cambrian thermal remanent magnetization or an early magnetization related to deuteric/hydrothermal alteration. The paleo-pole position is consistent with some other poles for Cambrian igneous rocks in southern Oklahoma but is to the southwest of the Cambrian part of the apparent polar wander path. The red granite contains abundant secondary hematite that occurs in fractures, as grain boundary coatings, and along cleavage and exsolution planes in alkali feldspars. The iron in the hematite appears to be sourced from the oxidation of primary magnetite and ilmenite and the breakdown of silicate ferromagnesian minerals. The red granite has about two orders of magnitude lower magnetic susceptibility and natural rema-nent intensity than the green granite. The magnetic fabric is interpreted as an alteration fabric. The ChRM of red granite has southeast declinations and shallow inclinations and is interpreted as a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) residing in hematite. The paleopole (44.9 degrees S, 304.9 degrees E) falls near the 290-300 Ma segment of the North American apparent polar wander path, which is consistent with inferred timing of exposure of the Long Mountain Granite. The CRM is interpreted to have been acquired during alteration by low-temperature weathering fluids near the surface during the late Paleozoic. The results from the red granite are not consistent with alteration caused by widespread paleoclimatic conditions in the Late Permian, and they are interpreted as related to local tectonic and/or weathering events.

J	Meerbeek, JR				Meerbeek, Jonathan R.			Using Radiotelemetry to Inform and Guide Muskellunge Culture and Stocking Techniques in Spirit Lake, Iowa	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Agencies commonly stock Muskellunge Esox masquinongy to maintain or augment populations throughout much of North America. Muskellunge poststocking survival is variable, and adult populations are vulnerable to periodic lapses in recruitment. Radiotelemetry evaluated whether changes in stocking techniques caused recruitment declines of spring-stocked yearling Muskellunge in Spirit Lake, Iowa, or whether total length, condition, or 10-d dispersal influenced poststocking survival. The workers fitted hatchery-reared Muskellunge (38-40 fish; n = 78 fish in total) with radio transmitters and stocked in May 2016-2017 by using one of two techniques: 1) fish stocked immediately following 6-h transport in a hatchery distribution truck with Edwards treatment-laden water or 2) fish provided 36-h recovery period after a hauling event and then stocked. Radiotelemetry revealed that stocking techniques did not influence Muskellunge survival or dispersal, but survival significantly improved for fish stocked at larger sizes. Using this information, production techniques in 2018-2019 included an additional 33-40-d rearing period for Muskellunge less than 330 mm when measured for total length in mid-May. We radiotagged a subset of these fish (14-16 fish/y; n = 30 fish total), and survival improved to more than 73.4%. Subsequent application of telemetry was via a side-by-side comparison in 2020 for greater than or equal to 330-mm Muskellunge fitted with radio transmitters and stocked in May (n = 17 fish) and those reared using the grow-out procedure and stocked in June (n = 21 fish). Both cohorts experienced poor survival (39.2-56.1%), resulting from both fish and great blue heron Ardea herodias predation, despite large differences in dispersal. Regardless of stocking technique, this study identified that most mortality occurred within the first 25 d poststocking. These results indicate that Muskellunge populations in natural lakes would benefit from a better understanding of poststocking survival and stocking practices that minimize predator threats during this critical period.																			1944-687X					DEC	2024	15	2								10.3996/JFWM-24-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-24-006													WOS:001488839600019
J	Beynen, PEV; Wang, P				Beynen, Philip Edward van; Wang, Ping			Paleoenvironmental interpretation of sinkhole sediments on a flat low-lying carbonate platform, a case study from Chassahowitzka River, west-central Florida	GEOMORPHOLOGY												After rapid increases in ocean volumes during the early Holocene, sea levels rose more slowly from the mid- to late-Holocene. The flat shelf of the eastern Gulf of Mexico meant even small rises in sea level shifted the coastline inland many kilometers. The impact of this transgression on the karst environments of western Florida is not well known. Here we investigate how one Floridian location responded to changing climate from the mid- and lateHolocene. Chassahowitzha River, representing one of many west-central Florida rivers, is spring fed and discharges into the Gulf of Mexico. Sinkholes along this river have the potential to preserve complete and undisturbed sedimentary records. Three sediment cores were collected from a sinkhole complex just north of the river. All three cores contain their sedimentary record down to the limestone bedrock. Ten radiocarbon dates were used to create the core chronologies. Interpretation of paleoenvironmental changes is based on sediment grain size analysis, microphotography, loss-on-ignition organic carbon contents and identification of microfossils in the sediments. Prior to 7 ka BP, sediments are dominated by quartz sand followed by an organic-rich layer ending at 6 ka BP. We interpret the organic sediments as the onset of a freshwater wetland/marsh environment along the river. Most of the marsh sediments are deposited between 7 and 6 ka BP when the coastline was 30 kms seaward. Next, there is a 3.8 kyr gap in deposition as demonstrated by the radiocarbon chronology. This hiatus could have been caused by changes in sea level, periods of aridity, draining of the sinkhole lakes or the development of the sinkhole complex. After this interval the sedimentary record is characterized by inorganic deposits which contain an abundance of microfossils. The topmost sediments of each core were interspersed with discrete shell layers which may be indicative of extreme storm events.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				MAR 1	2025	472								109589	10.1016/j.geomorph.2024.109589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2024.109589		JAN 2025											WOS:001402207200001

In 1970, NOAA was formed and NDBC was transferred to that agency. The first buoys operated and managed by NDBC were large, 12-meter discus buoys that were constructed of steel and deployed in deep waters off the U.S. East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. By 1979, NDBC maintained 26 stations: 16 in the Pacific Ocean, 7 in the Atlantic Ocean and 3 in the Gulf of Mexico. NDBC deployed 8 more stations in the Great Lakes during the 1980s. Today, NDBC operates 115 moored weather/ocean platforms, 52 coastal marine stations, 39 deep-ocean tsunameters and 55 tropical atmosphere ocean moored platforms in the equatorial Pacific. In response to the growing number of stations, NDBC established a data quality assurance group that quality controls data from all NDBC platforms, on a daily basis. The real-time observations are released through the NWS Telecommunications Gateway in Silver Spring, Maryland and sent to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information System telecommunication services. Automated quality control is applied before the observations are released (checking for parity errors, range checks for spurious points, time continuity checks and zero wave heights). In addition, the observations are evaluated after 45 days, edited and sent to U.S. archive data centers for permanent storage. In 2001, NDBC began receiving, processing, quality controlling and disseminating observations from 10 stations deployed by the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System. Weather Forecast Offices, mariners, transportation officials and the public wanted to ensure that the observations received NDBC's "stamp of approval" before they were used in daily operations. In July 2006, with funding from the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) Program, NDBC started the IOOS (R) Data Assembly Center - operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in response to increasing marine platforms, real-time observations and the need to support buoy recovery and deployment operations in the far reaches of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.																			0197-7385		978-1-4244-4960-6				2009							159	165																WOS:000280322600024
J	Khadka, P; Sharma, S; Mathis, T				Khadka, Pravakar; Sharma, Suresh; Mathis, Thomas			Monitoring an ungagged coastal marsh to analyze the salinity interaction of the marsh with Lake Erie	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Phragmites growth in a marsh watershed due to increased salinity has been a crucial issue across the world. The objective of this study was to investigate the salinity movement in the ungagged Mentor Marsh of Ohio, USA, where the salinity had increased due to a number of potential sources causing a decline in the native vegetation and leading to the increased invasive phragmites growth. In this study, we conducted a detailed bathymetric survey and established several monitoring stations to record hourly environmental data in Mentor Marsh. Since Mentor Marsh has a complex hydrologic characteristic, which interacts with Lake Erie due to the backwater effect, a hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC +), was developed to simulate the western Mentor Marsh wetland's salinity distribution. We evaluated the model performance by comparing water level, temperature, and salinity using statistical measures for a duration from December 2019 to March 2020. The model was calibrated using the measured time-series data of water temperatures, water levels, and water salinity from monitoring stations in the western basin. The model performance for salinity calibration (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.041, and Pbias = - 1.05%) and validation (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.066, and Pbias = - 2.05%) was good. In the next step, the calibrated model was utilized to investigate the salinity distributions under different inflow and lake level rise conditions. Our analysis suggested that during high-flow conditions, the advection of the saline water from Marsh Creek was vigorous in comparison to the diffusion of salinity mixing by tidal influence pushing the salinity towards Mentor Marsh and resulting in the lower salinity distribution within the model domain. Similarly, when the lake level rise occurred, the model predicted a significant decrease in the salinity of Mentor Marsh near Lake Erie. The average decrease of salinity from the salinity during the base run was - 45.8% near Lake Erie, - 29.7% at the junction of Mentor Marina and Mentor Marsh, - 21.2% in Mentor Marsh, and - 4.4% in Marsh Creek. The analysis further suggested that under high-flow conditions from Marsh Creek, the salinity moved towards Mentor Marsh, especially when lake level rise conditions were considered. This is mainly because the high water level of Lake Erie pushed March Creek towards Mentor Marsh. However, the salinity moved towards Lake Erie from Marsh Creek during low-flow conditions. Presumably, the phragmites growth in the western section seems to be due to the road salt used in winter for deicing purposes.

The accuracy of the model was validated by comparing the acceleration of the new model with the data achieved through experimental tests fusing a deflection measurement system mounted on a Ford F-150 truck. The experimental test for the PDMS is carried out on a random road profile, generated by an inertial profiler, over a 7.4-mile (12 km) loop around a lake near Austin, Texas. Integrating a reliability-based optimization (RBO) algorithm in a PDMS aims to optimize system parameters and reduce vibrations effectively. The PDMS noises and uncertainties make it crucial to use a robust system to ensure the stability of the system. This article presents a robust algorithm for considering the uncertainties of PDMS parameters, including the damping coefficients and spring stiffness of the supporting brackets. Moreover, it considers the variation of system parameters, such as stiffness of the vehicle's tire and changing in the weight of the vehicle based on the number of passengers sitting in the cars. This approach ensures the system's high accuracy and reliability, despite uncertainties and variations. Moreover, the presented algorithm calculates the optimum parameters of the PDMS model by minimizing the acceleration of the front and rear lasers and the rotation of the beam about the y-axis at the center of the beam. The accuracy of the RBO is being evaluated by comparing RBO with deterministic optimization methods. This comparison illustrates the accuracy of the RBO method for obtaining a more precise and reliable PDMS system. It also indicates the effectiveness of the RBO method in obtaining a more accurate and robust system, which can be utilized in real-world applications. RBO significantly minimizes the mean angular displacement of the beam (from 8.68 degrees to 2.18 degrees), as well as the RMS of front and rear accelerations (from 5.0 m/s2 to as low as 0.66 m/s2), based on variance reductions.

J	Kennedy, CR; Shears, PC; Shears, JA				Kennedy, CR; Shears, PC; Shears, JA			Long-term dynamics of Ligula intestinalis and roach Rutilus rutilus:: a study of three epizootic cycles over thirty-one years	PARASITOLOGY												Data are presented on 2 full epizootic cycles and the start of a third of Ligula intestinalis in roach Rutilus rutilus in a small lake, and the relationships of these cycles to the densities of rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, and Great Crested Grebes, Podiceps cristatus, over 31 years. The parasite was introduced to the lake by P. cristatus in 1973 at a time when the roach population had increased in response to eutrophication to a level at which individual fish growth was stunted and the hithero dominant rudd population had declined in numbers as a consequence of inter-specific competition with roach. Ligula prevalence peaked at 28% in only 2 years: thereafter parasite-induced host mortality caused a decline in the roach population, releasing fish from stunting and allowing the rudd population to recover. The consequent improved growth of roach individuals and their short life-span reduced Ligula transmission rates and prevalence levels declined to approximately 1% although Ligula nevertheless persisted for a further 10 years. Folio-wing a massive winter-kill of the fish populations in 1984-1985, fish and Ligula numbers declined to barely detectable levels and the parasite disappeared from samples. Rudd recovered first, then roach and interspecific competition again led to a decline in rudd numbers. This increase in roach numbers led to a decrease in roach growth rates, which coincided with the re-colonization of the lake by Ligula. This second epizootic of Ligula peaked within 2 years in 1991-1992, when up to 78% of roach were infected with a maximum abundance of 2-2 parasites and intensity of 21 parasites. Heavy parasite-induced mortality of roach led to a decline in numbers, an improvement in individual growth rate and a reduction of Ligula transmission rates such that the epizootic died out in 1996. Similar conditions of roach numbers and growth prevailed at the start of a third cycle in 1998. The course of events over the second cycle was so similar to that of the first that it confirms the interpretations of that cycle. Comparison with other localities shows that epizootics of Ligula always coincide with rapid increases in roach numbers, for whatever cause, and stunted growth, which together attract piscivorous birds. At the start of a cycle Ligula is a major determinant of the population dynamics of the roach, but at the end of the cycle the fish population dynamics determine those of the parasite. The cycles are not regulated and the roach-Ligula system is inherently unstable.																			0031-1820					SEP	2001	123		3				257	269		10.1017/S0031182001008538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182001008538								11578089					WOS:000171485400006

The sedimentary sequence was continuously sampled at 0.5 m resolution at a vertical Yedoma cliff starting from 24.2 m above river level (a.r.l.). The sequence differentiates into three cryostratigraphic units: Unit A, dated from ca. 52 to 28 cal kyr BP; Unit B, dated from ca. 28 to 15 cal kyr BP; Unit C, dated from ca. 7 to 0 cal kyr BP. Three chronologic gaps in the record are striking. The hiatus during the interstadial marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 (36-29 cal kyr BP) as well as during stadial MIS 2 (20-17 cal kyr BP) might be related to fluvial erosion and/or changed discharge patterns of the Lena river caused by repeated outburst floods from the glacial Lake Vitim in southern Siberia along the Lena river valley towards the Arctic Ocean. The hiatus during the MIS 2-1 transition (15-7 cal kyr BP) is a commonly observed feature in permafrost chronologies due to intense thermokarst activity of the deglacial period. The chronologic gaps of the Sobo-Sise Yedoma record are similarly found at two neighbouring Yedoma IC sites on Bykovsky Peninsula and Kurungnakh-Sise Island and are most likely of regional importance. The three cryostratigraphic units of the Sobo-Sise Yedoma exhibit distinct signatures in properties of their clastic, organic, and ice components. Higher permafrost aggradation rates of 1 m kyr(-1) with higher organic-matter (OM) stocks (29 +/- 15 kg C m(-3), 2.2 +/- 1.0 kg N m( -3); Unit A) and mainly coarse silt are found for the interstadial MIS 3 if compared to the stadial MIS 2 with 0.7 m kyr(-1) permafrost aggradation, lower OM stocks (14 +/- 8 kg C m(-3), 1.4 +/- 0.4 kg N m(-3); Unit B), and pronounced peaks in the coarse-silt and mediumsand fractions. Geochemical signatures of intra-sedimental ice reflect the differences in summer evaporation and moisture regime by higher ion content and less depleted ratios of stable delta O-18 and stable delta D isotopes but lower deuterium excess (d) values during interstadial MIS 3 if compared to stadial MIS 2. The delta O-18 and delta D composition of MIS 3 and MIS 2 ice wedges shows characteristic well-depleted values and low d values, while MIS 1 ice wedges have elevated mean d values between 11 parts per thousand and 15 parts per thousand and surprisingly low delta O-18 and delta D values. Hence, the isotopic difference between latePleistocene and Holocene ice wedges is more pronounced in d than in delta values. The present study of the permafrost exposed at the Sobo-Sise Yedoma cliff provides a comprehensive cryostrati- graphic inventory, insights into permafrost aggradation, and degradation over the last approximately 52 kyr as well as their climatic and morphodynamic controls on the regional scale of the central Laptev Sea coastal region in NE Siberia.

The establishment of Poyang Lake Pilot Ecological Economic Zone is a major strategic move to implement the scientific outlook on development in line with the actual conditions in Jiangxi Province and the country as a whole, a scientific decision concerning the long-term development of the province, and also an important action to enhance the sustainability of the Yangtze River Basin. This pilot zone covers the Poyang Lake Basin - the whole Jiangxi Province. In some sense, it renews and further advances the Mountain-River-Lake Program implemented by the science and technology community of Jiangxi Province over the years. But it's not simple inheritance. Instead, it is a significant strategic breakthrough, a shift from the development and management of the hilly or mountainous areas in the middle and upper reaches of the five major rivers in the province to ecological economic development in the Poyang Lake Basin and plains around the lake, and a transition from the management of mountains, lakes, rivers and poverty alleviation to the construction of a new economic system which embraces globalization and an innovation-oriented (resource-conserving, environmentally-friendly and low-carbon-oriented) society. It represents a major innovation and stride leap in the scientific and technological work and the Mountain-Lake-River Program in the great period of strategic opportunities. As remarked by U.S. ecological economist Lester R. Brown, economic principles and ecological principles are isomorphic, so economists and ecologists should join hands in building an economic pattern beneficial to the earth - ecological economy. Ecological economy aims to promote economic and social sustainability on the basis of ecological balance. Technological innovation is the most central issue in building ecological economy. It is not only an effective approach to attain reasonable distribution and conserve resources, but also a dominant force that boosts industrial restructuring and transformation of economic growth patterns, and more importantly, a major means for ecological construction and environmental protection. How to boost the sound and rapid development of ecological economy in the region is the most pressing task for the science and technology community of Jiangxi Province.																			2363-6866		978-981-10-0461-2; 978-981-10-0459-9				2016							111	118		10.1007/978-981-10-0461-2_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-0461-2_10	10.1007/978-981-10-0461-2												WOS:000385218300011
J	KEIZER, P; SINKE, AJC				KEIZER, P; SINKE, AJC			PHOSPHORUS IN THE SEDIMENT OF THE LOOSDRECHT LAKES AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR LAKE RESTORATION PERSPECTIVES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In 1984 the external phosphorus load of the shallow eutrophic Loosdrecht lakes was reduced from 3.3 to 1.0 mg m-2 d-1. The effect of phosphorus release from the sediment on lake restoration was investigated. Diffusive release under aerobic conditions (20-degrees-C) decreased from 1 mg m-2 d-1 in 1984 to 0.3 mg m-2 d-1 in 1990. The generation of inorganic phosphorus due to mineralization during summer equals 3 mg m-2 d-1, which is much higher than the measured rate of diffusive release. Despite that, the phosphorus release is hardly stimulated by anaerobic conditions, which indicates that only a small amount of phosphorus is adsorbed by ferric iron in the top sediment layer. This apparent discrepancy is probably caused by the uptake of inorganic phosphorus uptake during resuspension and the loss of inorganic phosphorus with downward seepage. The estimated removal of phosphorus due to downward seepage of 0.8 mg m-2 d-1 agrees well with the average phosphorus retention in the lake. This indicates that sediment burial and diagenesis are unimportant mechanisms for withdrawing phosphorus from the nutrient cycle. Between 1982 and 1991 the total phosphorus content of the upper 2 cm of the sediment decreased from 0.94 to 0.60 g kg-1 DW. At present, about 20% of total phosphorus in this layer is potentially bioavailable, but largely incorporated in easily degradable organic matter. This pool is much smaller in deeper layers. Based on the estimated and measured rates and pool sizes, the annual average phosphorus cycle in the lakes was modelled to evaluate the effects of various restoration measures. The main predictions of the model are: 1) further reduction of the external load may cause a gradual decrease of the total phosphorus concentration in the lake water; 2) dredging and iron addition, without reduction of the external load, may give a rapid improvement followed by a slow return to the present situation; and 3) reduction of the external load, combined with a cut off of downward seepage will not improve the water quality.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					39	50		10.1007/BF00016094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016094													WOS:A1992JD64800006
J	Lorenz, V				Lorenz, Volker			Syn- and posteruptive hazards of maar-diatreme volcanoes	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					2nd International Maar Conference	SEP 21-25, 2004	Lajosmizse, HUNGARY	Int Assoc Volcanol & Chem Earth Interior, IAVCEI, Commiss Volcanogen Sediments, Int Assoc Sedimentol, Int Comm Hungarh, Slovak Republic Germany				Maar-diatreme volcanoes represent the second most common volcano type on continents and islands. This study presents a first review of syn- and posteruptive volcanic and related hazards and intends to stimulate future research in this field. Maar-diatreme volcanoes are phreatomagmatic monogenetic volcanoes. They may erupt explosively for days to 15 years. Above the preeruptive surface a relatively flat tephra ring forms. Below the preemptive surface the maar crater is incised because of formation and downward penetration of a cone-shaped diatreme and its root zone. During activity both the maar-crater and the diatreme grow in depth and diameter. Inside the diatreme, which may penetrate downwards for up to 2.5 km, fragmented country rocks and juvenile pyroclasts accumulate in primary pyroclastic deposits but to a large extent also as reworked deposits. Ejection of large volumes of country rocks results in a mass deficiency in the root zone of the diatreme and causes the diatreme fill to subside, thus the diatreme represents a kind of growing sinkhole. Due to the subsidence of the diatreme underneath, the maar-crater is a subsidence crater and also grows in depth and diameter with ongoing activity. As long as phreatomagmatic eruptions continue the tephra ring grows in thickness and outer slope angle. Syneruptive hazards of maar-diatreme volcanoes are earthquakes, eruption clouds, tephra fall, base surges, ballistic blocks and bombs, lahars, volcanic gases, cutting of the growing maar crater into the preeruptive ground, formation of a tephra ring, fragmentation of country rocks, thus destruction of area and ground, changes in groundwater table, and potential renewal of eruptions. The main hazards mostly affect an area 3 to possibly 5 km in radius. Distal effects are comparable to those of small eruption clouds from polygenetic volcanoes. Syneruptive effects on infrastructure, people, animals, vegetation, agricultural land, and drainage are pointed out. Posteruptive hazards concern erosion and formation of lahars. Inside the crater a lake usually forms and diverse types of sediments accumulate in the crater. Volcanic gases may be released in the crater. Compaction and other diagenetic processes within the diatreme fill result in its subsidence. This posteruptive subsidence of the diatreme fill and thus crater floor is relatively large initially but will decrease with time. It may last millions of years. Various studies and monitoring are suggested for syn- and posteruptive activities of maar-diatreme volcanoes erupting in the future. The recently formed maar-diatreme volcanoes should be investigated repeatedly to understand more about their syneruptive behaviour and hazards and also their posteruptive topographic, limnic, and biologic evolution, and potential posteruptive hazards. For future maar-diatreme eruptions a hazard map with four principal hazard zones is suggested with the two innermost ones having a joint radius of up to 5 km. Areas that are potentially endangered by maar-diatreme eruptions in the future are pointed out. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Source apportionment of SOx and sulfate and the conversion of SO2 to sulfate in the Green River basin	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												During January-March of 1990 a study was conducted to determine the sources of sulfur oxide emissions present in the Canyonlands area in Utah. Samples were collected at the Island-in-the-Sky visitors center in Canyonlands National Park and at several sites circling the park to characterize the chemical composition of air masses influencing the receptor sites from various geographical regions. The results of the sampling program and the identified chemical fingerprints of the sources that can impact the Canyonlands receptor site have been given in the first two papers in a series of three papers. In this paper are presented the results of chemical mass balance source apportionment of the SOx present at Canyonlands, Green River, Bullfrog Marina and Edge of the Cedars, Utah, using the chemical composition and source fingerprint data given in the preceding papers. The results indicate that the presence of sulfur oxides at the Canyonlands area is a regional problem not dominated by a single source. The contributions to SOx at Canyonlands during the 21 days included in the source apportionment analyses included sources to the southwest (37%), south and southeast (20%), north and northeast (19%), and northwest (23%). At the Edge of the Cedars State Park to the southeast of Canyonlands, sources from the southeast contributed 51% of the observed SOx. At Bullfrog Marina in the Lake Powell National Recreation Area, southwest of Canyonlands, sources to the southwest were responsible for 81% of the SOx present. At Green River, to the north of Canyonlands, the contribution of sources to the north and northeast were reduced (10%) because the major transport path of sources from these directions was the movement of emission from northwestern Colorado down the Colorado River drainage and south of Green River. The apportionment of sulfate at Canyonlands has been estimated from a combination of the chemical mass balance SOx source apportionment results, the measured concentrations of SO2 and particulate sulfate, and meteorological data. This analysis indicates that, while the main source of SOx at Canyonlands is from emissions to the southwest, the main source of sulfate is from SOx emissions originating from the southeast of Canyonlands.																			1352-2310					JAN	1996	30	2					295	308		10.1016/1352-2310(95)00246-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1352-2310(95)00246-U													WOS:A1996TK58300010
J	Widerlund, A; Ebenå, G; Landin, J				Widerlund, A; Ebenå, G; Landin, J			Potential biogeochemical and ecological development of a flooded tailings impoundment at the Kristineberg Zn-Cu mine, northern Sweden	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The potential short-term (less than or equal to10(2) years) and long-term (>10(2) years) biogeochemical and ecological effects of diverting stream water (pH 4.9-6.7) into a limed, flooded tailings impoundment (pH 8-12) were studied by combining geochemical and biological data. In the long-term perspective, the successional development of lakes was used as a natural analogue. Based on the vertical distribution of temperature and total dissolved solids (TDS < 0.22 mum), the impoundment can be characterised as a continuous/discontinuous cold polymictic lake, with holomictic summer circulation. A re-inoculation study indicated that the growth of autotrophic, aerobic bacteria (presumably Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) presently is inhibited by the high pH in the impoundment. In a short-term perspective, termination of liming and diversion of stream water into the impoundment will result in a complex interplay between physical, biogeochemical and ecological effects. A reduced vertical mixing of the similar to2-m-deep water column, dissolution of calcite and gypsum (compounds of a sludge formed in the impoundment) and an enhanced microbiological activity are major expected effects. The dissolution of calcite may act as a pH buffer and result in metal remobilisation from the sludge. Excluding autochthonous organic matter produced in the impoundment, streamwater input of suspended matter and formation of settling flocculants are expected to result in a sediment accumulation rate of similar to1.5 mg cm(-2) year(-1) (1.6-3.3 cm/10(2) years). Settling allochthonous organic C (0.15-0.30 mg C cm(-2) year(-1)) may serve as an oxygen barrier and as a reservoir of organic compounds capable of driving redox reactions. In a long-term perspective, a hydroseral development into a wetland/peatland can be expected, with a bog lake, poor fen or flat bog as final stage. This development presupposes a decreasing pH when liming is terminated and stream water is diverted into the impoundment. It also assumes that the impoundment will be similar to an acidified lake, and that the succession is driven by Sphagnum colonizing the impoundment. If the hydrological conditions/water level is affected (e.g., by climatic changes or a dam failure), a terrestrialization culminating in coniferous forest on peat soil may occur.

J	LINDSTROM, K				LINDSTROM, K			EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE, LIGHT AND PH ON GROWTH, PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND RESPIRATION OF THE DINOFLAGELLATE PERIDINIUM-CINCTUM FA WESTII IN LABORATORY CULTURES	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Optimum light, temperature and pH conditions for growth, photosynthetic, and respiratory activities of P. cinctum f. westii (Lemm.) Lef were investigated by using axenic clones in batch cultures. The results are discussed and compared with data from Lake Kinneret (Israel) where it produces heavy blooms in spring.

Photosynthetic O2 release was more efficient in filtered light of blue (BG 12) and red (RG 2) than in green (VG 9) qualities. Photosynthetic O2 production occurred at temperatures ranging from 5.degree.-32.degree. C in white fluorescent light from 10 to 105 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 with a gross maximum value of 1500 .times. 10-12 g .cntdot. cell-1 .cntdot. h-1 at the highest irradiance. The average respiration amounted to .apprx. 12% of the gross production and reached a maximum value of .apprx. 270 .cntdot. 10-12 g .cntdot. cell-1 .cntdot. h-1 at 31.degree. C. A comparison of photosynthetic and respiratory Q10-value showed that in the upper temperature range the increase in gross production was only a 1/3 of the corresponding increase in respiration, although the gross production was at maximum. Short intermittent periods of dark (> 7 min) before high light exposures from a halogen lamp greatly increased O2 production. Depending on the physiological status of the alga, light saturation values were reached at 500-1000 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 of halogen light with compensation points at 20-40 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 and Ik-values at 100-200 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1. The corresponding values in fluorescent light in which it was cultured and adapted were 25 to 75% lower indicating the ability of the alga to efficiently utilize varying light conditions, if the adaptation time is sufficient. Carbon fixation was most efficient at .apprx. pH 7, but the growth rates and biomass development were highest at pH 8.3.																			0022-3646	1529-8817					1984	20	2					212	220		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00212.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1984.00212.x													WOS:A1984SY05800006

The impact of a freshwater diluted plume on spatial halite accumulation in a hypersaline lake: Direct observations from the Dead Sea	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The role of freshwater inputs and salinity gradients in hypersaline basins is crucial for understanding the formation of evaporitic sequences. However, this role remains poorly understood, as it involves complex processes such as mixing across density gradients, plume dynamics and air-water interactions. This study addresses this gap by investigating how a diluted buoyant plume, formed by freshwater inflows, affects spatial halite accumulation in the Dead Sea, a modern analogue for ancient evaporitic environments. In situ measurements of halite accumulation rates were conducted along transects extending from nearshore freshwater inflows (discharging similar to 70 x 10(6) m(3)year(-1)), through the diluted plume, and into regions beyond the dilution effect. These measurements were complemented by analyses of spatiotemporal limnological conditions (salinity, temperature, turbidity and halite saturation), which are influenced by wind-wave action. The diluted plume exhibits a distinct salinity structure, with full dilution at the freshwater spring discharge and exponential decay in both horizontal and vertical directions: horizontally, it decays over similar to 500 m, with surface dilution extending similar to 2 km offshore, and vertically it decays over similar to 0.06 m, creating a thin, highly diluted upper layer of about 1 m thick. Consequently, halite accumulation rates increase along the transect from the freshwater inflows towards deeper areas as the dilution effect diminishes. This process is controlled by (i) the transport of supersaturated brine and halite crystals from the non-diluted environment under the diluted plume and (ii) direct precipitation of halite when the diluted plume undergoes mechanical mixing. Persistent undersaturation in the upper diluted plume layer prevents halite precipitation and, when combined with the declining lake level, leads to the dissolution of previously deposited halite layers in deeper areas. The absence of halite near the freshwater inflow and the thickening of halite towards the depocenter are observed in early Holocene Dead Sea basin halite sequences and other global halite records.

In June of 2015, Irving performed an aerial survey of the pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipe to observe portions of the line difficult to access by land. The aerial survey revealed a portion of the pipeline exposed at its crossing of the South Sulphur River, near Greenville, Texas. Further investigation established that the river bottom and embankments had eroded substantially, undermining the pipeline as much as eight feet in some locations. NTMWD and Irving declared the stabilization and repair of the crossing to be an emergency, expediting design, and construction services. Competitive sealed proposals were obtained from three trusted contractors. The selection process included interviews with two finalists, with Garney Construction selected to perform the project. The project key objective was to first stabilize the at-risk 84-inch water main servicing NTMWD and Irving with concrete cradling up to the spring line of the pipe. The concrete was placed by a tremie installation after the flow of the river was controlled with cubic yard sand bags. Once the pipe was determined to be successfully stabilized, the second phase of the project was to armor the steadily eroding riverbanks that had already lost more than 30 feet of shoreline since the original investigation that qualified the project to be an emergency. The banks were armored, crest to toe, with filter fabric and 36-inch rock rip rap up and downstream of the pipeline crossing. Sequentially, the permanent easement through the river was bordered with sheet piling in which a flex base backfill encased the supported pipe. Lastly, a one-foot thick, reinforced, concrete slab capped the flex base fill protecting the endangered pipe across the span of the river. Engineering design, environmental permitting, and innovative construction methods brought this project to a successful completion in March of 2017.																					978-0-7844-8165-3				2018							352	361																WOS:000542616400038
J	Kozhevnikov, NO; Kharinsky, AV; Kozhevnikov, OK				Kozhevnikov, NO; Kharinsky, AV; Kozhevnikov, OK			An accidental geophysical discovery of an Iron Age archaeological site on the western shore of Lake Baikal	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Slowly decaying transients were measured during a TEM survey over crystalline metamorphic rocks in the vicinity of the village of Chernorud, on the western shore of Lake Baikal. Once converted to apparent resistivities, these transients resulted in values of about 2-5 Omega m. Because neither in-field nor laboratory DC resistivity measurements indicate conductive rocks, the TEM results are confusing. It is hypothesized that the anomalous transients were caused by the relaxation of the magnetization of extremely fine ferri- and/or ferromagnetic particles concentrated in the near-surface layer. In 1997, in the soil thrown out of a gopher burrow, slags and charcoal fragments were found which suggested ancient metallurgical activity. Despite the slags being electrically poorly conductive, once placed into a small coil, they produced slowly decaying transients caused by magnetic viscosity effects. On the basis of their chemical and mineral composition, the Chernorud site slags proved to be identical to those which are known to have been formed during the production of iron in ancient bloomery furnaces. An excavation carried out at the site of the gopher burrow resulted in the discovery of a large bloomery furnace, much slag, charcoal, and baked clay fragments. In 1999, reconnaissance magnetic field and galvanic resistivity profiling measurements were conducted, focused on the site's archaeological potential. Data were taken over a 96 X 100 m area at 4 m intervals along parallel profiles spaced at 4 m. The magnetic field contour and surface maps exhibited an isometrically shaped positive anomaly with an amplitude of 40-50 nT, that was 30-40 m in diameter. The bloomery and other archaeometallurgical structures fall within the central part of the magnetic anomaly. The galvanic profiling has revealed a resistivity high (1000-1500 Omega m against 300-500 Omega m) which might be attributed to ancient human activity. Radiocarbon dating of three charcoal fragments sampled during the excavation from different depth intervals has given uncalibrated ages of 1915 +/- 35, 2050 +/- 35 and 2180 +/- 30 years BP. These results make it apparent that the Iron Age on the western shore of Lake Baikal started about 700-900 years earlier than is generally accepted. Occurrence of slags over an area of no less than 15 ha suggests that iron production in the Barun-Khal valley was performed on a large scale. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

Irrespective of their protection status, these habitats may be threatened by organic matter accumulation, progressively leading to structural homogenization and habitat succession towards woodland. Managers prevent excessive litter build-up with various interventions opening-up the reedbeds, such as grazing, which may be detrimental or suitable for some reed bird species. We assessed the effects of extensive grazing by horses and its cessation in the medium and long terms on reedbed structure, and the consequences on reed-nesting songbird densities in Estagnol Nature Reserve, a protected wetland near the French Mediterranean coast. We compared reedbed structural features between grazed, newly ungrazed and old-ungrazed plots. During nine years, we censused four songbird species in spring and collected water level data in the same survey plots. Grazing reduced reedbed extent, rejuvenated the vegetation with more short green stems on a thinner litter, and produced higher structural heterogeneity and discontinuity compared to long-lasting non grazing. Newly ungrazed plot showed intermediate effects. All surveyed songbird total densities were similar among plots while species numbers and densities differed. Grazed reedbed was more attractive to Moustached Warblers (Acrocephalus melanopogon) and Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), likely due to the large edges and the high vegetation structural heterogeneity. However, Moustached Warblers were more negatively affected by higher water level in grazed reedbed, presumably because flooding prevents litter foraging. The newly ungrazed reedbed was not preferred by any species. All warbler species were found under low density in the old-ungrazed reedbed, where Reed Buntings (Emberiza schoeniclus) were exclusively found. Food availability related to thick litter layer may explain this predilection. Common Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) were found everywhere in similar densities. We conclude that reedbed management by extensive horse grazing and also its long-term cessation may benefit several songbird species.

In this paper, we present evidence of late-Quaternary environmental change from the Marguerite Bay region combining data from lake sediment records on Horseshoe Island and Pourquoi-Pas Island, and raised beaches at Horseshoe Island, Pourquoi-Pas Island and Calmette Bay. Lake sediments were radiocarbon dated and analysed using a combination of sedimentological, geochemical and microfossil methods. Raised beaches were surveyed and analysed for changes in clast composition, size and roundness. Results suggest a non-erosive glacial regime could have existed on Horseshoe Island from 35,780 (38,650-33,380) or 32,910 (34,630-31,370) cal yr BP onwards. There is radiocarbon and macrofossil evidence for possible local deglaciation events at 28,830 (29,370-28,320) cal yr BP, immediately post-dating Antarctic Isotopic Maximum 4, and 21,110 (21,510-20,730 interpolated) cal yr BP coinciding with, or immediately post-dating, Antarctic Isotopic Maximum 2. The Holocene deglaciation of Horseshoe Island commenced from 10,610 (11,000-10,300) cal yr BP at the same time as the early Holocene temperature maximum recorded in Antarctic ice cores. This was followed by the onset of marine sedimentation in The Narrows, Pourquoi-Pas Island, before 8850 (8480-9260) cal yr BP. Relative sea level high stands of 40.79 m above present at Pourquoi-Pas Island and 40.55 m above present at Calmette Bay occurred sometime after 9000 cal yr BP and suggest that a thicker ice sheet, including grounded ice streams, was present in this region of the Antarctic Peninsula than that recorded at sites further north. Isolation of the Narrows Lake basin on Pourquoi-Pas Island shows relative sea level in this region had fallen rapidly to 19.41 m by 7270 (7385-7155) cal yr BP. Chaetoceros resting spores suggest high productivity and stratified surface waters in The Narrows after 8850 (9260-8480) cal yr BP and beach clasts provide evidence of a period of increased wave energy at approximately 8000 yr BP. Lake sediment and beach data suggest an extended period of regional warming sometime between 6200 and 2030 cal yr BP followed by the onset of Neoglacial conditions from 2630 and 2030 cal yr BP in Narrows Lake and Col Lake 1, respectively. Diatom and delta C-13 vs C/N and macrofossil evidence suggest a potential increase in the number of birds and seals visiting the Narrows Lake catchment sometime after 2100 (2250-2000) cal yr BP, with enhanced nutrient enrichment evident after 1150 (1230-1080) cal yr BP, and particularly from c. 460 (540-380) cal yr BP. A very recent increase in Gomphonema species and organic carbon in the top centimetre of the Narrows Lake sediment core after c. 410 (490-320) cal yr BP, and increased sedimentation rates in the Col Lake 1 sediment core, after c. 400 (490-310) cal yr BP may be a response to the regional late-Holocene warming of the Antarctic Peninsula.

Aggradation and progradation controlled clinothems and deep-water sand delivery model in the Neogene Lake Pannon, Mako Trough, Pannonian Basin, SE Hungary	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												In the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene Lake Pannon, regression went on for about 6 Ma. Sediments arriving from the Alpine-Carpathian source area were partly accumulated on the flat-lying morphological shelf of the lake, whereas other portions of the sediment were passing through to the slope and deposited on the deep basin floor. The height of the slope exceeded 400-500 m based on correlated well and seismic data. An extended 3D seismic volume covering the Mako. Trough, one of the largest and deepest depressions within the Pannonian Basin, provided an opportunity to study sequences and shelf-margin trajectories generated as a result of continuous slope advancement. The lithology of these shelf, slope and basin centre deposits was inferred from seven well logs and 220 m core material. In the Mako Trough the southeastward migrating shelf-margin was formed by alternating aggradational and progradational clinothems. Aggradational clinothems, i.e. aggradation accompanied by subordinate progradation, are characterised by rising shelf-margin trajectories. The shelf built up from inner-shelf to shelf-edge deltaic lobes which compose a few dozen metre thick coarsening-up units. The majority of the sand, however, was transported by effective turbidity currents through leveed channels into the basin, and deposited as thick, extended slope-detached turbidite lobes up to a distance of 30 km from the shelf edge. In aggradational clinothems both the shelf and the basin floor accreted vertically. Development of progradational clinothems resulted in horizontal (flat) shelf-margin trajectories. Corresponding reflections toplap at the shelf edge and downlap within a distance of few kilometres from the toe of the slope. The shelf was bypassed, sediments accumulated on the slope and directly at the slope-toe region as small simple lobes. Short-distance transport was the result of clay-poor, non-effective turbidity currents. Consequently, the thickness of coeval basin-centre sediments remained negligible in progradational clinothems. Alternations of rising and horizontal shelf margin trajectories indicate that the climate- and subsidence-controlled lacustrine base-level rose continuously, though at varying rates. Descending trajectories were not observed. It means that base-level drops larger in amplitude than the seismic resolution (20-30 m), did not occur during the studied time interval, i.e. at 7-5 Ma ago, approximately corresponding to the Messinian age. As a result, major forced-regressive wedges or lowstand fans did not develop. This is in contrast with former stratigraphic models claiming that several 3rd-order sequences, including the intra-Messinian unconformity supposedly induced by hundred metres large lake-level drop, developed in Lake Pannon with significant volume of lowstand deposits as turbidites. Instead, aggradational and progradational dinothems are interpreted as fourth-order transgressive, early and late highstand systems tracts. These incomplete sequences represent less than 100 kyr time intervals. Due to climate control both on high rate of sediment supply and the water budget of Lake Pannon, conditions were more favourable for deposition of large volumes of well-developed turbidite systems during base-level rise than during stagnation or minor base-level fall. Therefore, sand delivery to the basin centre was at maximum during the early highstand aggradational stage and at minimum during the late highstand progradational stage. The timing and position of sand accumulation in the Mako. Trough of Lake Pannon is different from those predicted by "traditional" sequence stratigraphic considerations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mathewes, RW				Mathewes, Rolf W.			Plant macrofossils as indicators of vegetation and climate change in the Northern Black Forest of Germany during the last millennium-with focus on the Little Ice Age	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												In order to better understand the potential effects of climatic change on forest cover during and after the Little Ice Age (ad 1550 to 1880), a high-elevation cirque Lake (Wildsee am Ruhestein) was cored and analysed using continuous plant macrofossil analysis, supplemented by standard pollen analysis. The plant macrofossil record provides local information for climate changes not clearly seen in regional pollen records for the Northern Black Forest. Abundant deposition of white fir (Abies alba) needles is restricted to the Little Ice Age, suggesting reaction to climatic cooling. Human impacts, particularly forest clearing, are well documented historically during the past millennium, but discrete peaks in needle flux are only recorded at Wildsee once Little Ice Age cooling begins. The first needle flux event at 39-42 cm depth has a median modelled age of ad 1650, at the start of the Maunder Minimum, recognized as a particularly cold interval. Also of climatic significance is the flux of 19 immature Abies needles recovered from the 30-33 cm layer, dated around ad 1720. This finding is interpreted as clear evidence of severe spring frosts during the Little Ice Age, discrete events that are well-recorded in historical observations. Pollen analysis also supports cooling, beginning at a depth of 54 cm, modelled at ad 1560 during the beginning of the Little Ice Age. A decline in oak (Quercus) pollen begins around ad 1560 at the start of pollen zone IV, which also includes the lowest total pollen accumulation rates seen, suggesting a climatic influence. The significant forest dieback (Waldsterben) events that were observed during the late 1970 and 1980 s could not be identified in our pollen and macrofossil data. The combined approach of using pollen and detailed macrofossil analysis provides a better reconstruction of forest history than either technique in isolation, and the combination is potentially important for management of protected areas such as the Black Forest National Park.

WELL VERTICAL DRAINAGE AS METHOD FOR DECREASING OF EXOGGEODYNAMIC ACTIVITY ON SLOPE AREAS	VISNYK OF TARAS SHEVCHENKO NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KYIV-GEOLOGY												The territory of Mezhyhirya on the right bank of the Kiev reservoir, which is characterized by the development of various dangerous exogenous geological processes, primarily landslides and flooding, is being considered as the object of research. The purpose of the research is to substantiate the method of artificially lowering of groundwater level within the flooded areas of Mezhyhirya with a corresponding decrease in risk of landslide activity. In the course of the research, an analysis of general and specific factors of the activation of landslides within the Mezhyhirya area was carried out and its results proved that most of these factors are related to natural and technogenically disturbed hydrogeological conditions of the research area. The authors have determined the sources of technogenic feeding, the zones of increased moisture within the natural boundary, as well as the directions and structure of groundwater transit to the territory of Mezhyhiria. The performed studies and their results confirm the need to reduce the saturation of aquifers and, accordingly, the exo-geodynamic activity of rocks within the territory of Mezhyhirya. The technical solution was based on the drilling of vertical drainage wells connecting the quaternary ground and the Obukhov-Mezhygorsk collector aquifer. Hydro geological calculations of the water volume of the daily drainage of the involved wells were performed, which must have been about 104 m(3)/day. Three observation wells were involved for monitoring the decrease in the piezometric level of groundwater. Control observations of groundwater levels confirmed an effectiveness of the proposed scheme; however, during the spring upsurge of 2013, vertical drainage wells did not ensure complete interception of the filtration flow. A possible reason for this is the increase in the hydrodynamic load of the groundwater aquifer due to irrigation and leakage from lakes. At subsequent stages of research, mapping of filtration flows seems appropriate. The data obtained as a result of the study can serve as the basis for designing a set of solutions for drainage of the aquifer and anti-landslide measures within the territory of Mezhyhirya.

Due to their smooth surface and reflective nature they provide limited habitat opportunities for aquatic species. One example is Cleveland's Cuyahoga River navigation channel. The Cuyahoga River navigation channel has been transformed from a natural system to an important passageway for maritime commerce but is now a daunting corridor for transient fish. For fish, the ability to migrate upriver to spawn as adults and downriver to return to Lake Erie as juveniles is critical to their survival. The navigation channel poses challenges due to lack of habitat, limited food sources, low water velocity, and at certain times of the year, low dissolved oxygen and high water temperatures. Much of the navigable portion of river (5 miles/8 km) is lined on both sides with steel sheet pile bulkheads. The 27 foot (8.3m) dredged channel and the vertical sheet pile bulkheads provide very limited opportunities for habitat reestablishment. Since 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) has been developing, testing and implementing technologies to create habitat for larval and juvenile fish while maintaining the channel for navigation. Building on lessons learned from earlier work, the objective of the Green Bulkhead Project is to understand the altered system dynamics of the river, and use the principles of biomimicry to develop a replicable and durable solution for creating functional habitat for larval fish along the aging steel bulkheads. The project team has identified desired functions (shelter and nourishment) and defined project context, which includes designing the retrofit to withstand large sediment loads, passing vessels and ice within the channel. The conceptual design stage looked to biological models for inspiration. The selected alternative is a hanging steel basket that can be attached to the inner flanges of the bulkhead sheets. The baskets can be filled with a variety of natural materials to mimic natural river bank functions. The baskets have been designed to meet the difficult conditions in the navigation channel. Prototypes of the habitat enhancement baskets were installed in the fall of 2015.																					978-0-7844-7990-2				2016							597	606																WOS:000400166700060
J	Luo, M; Huang, HG; Zhang, P; Wu, QH; Chen, DF				Luo, Min; Huang, Huagu; Zhang, Peng; Wu, Qinghai; Chen, Duofu			Origins of gas discharging from the Qiangtang Basin in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China: Evidence from gas compositions, helium, and carbon isotopes	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Gas compositions, helium isotopic ratios, and carbon isotopic compositions of CO2 and CH4 from six gas emission sites in the Qiangtang Basin and its adjacent areas were measured in order to unravel their origins. Gas samples from the Beiluhe, the Bucha Lake, and the eastern Tuotuo River are N-2-rich with N-2 over 75 vol.%, while the contents of CO2 and CH4 are only 3.45-20.91 vol.% and 0-3.58 vol.%, respectively. Relatively high CO2/He-3 (similar to 9.95 x 10(11)) and CH4/He-3 (5.9 x 10(9)-1.65 x 10(10)), and low delta C-13 values of CO2 (similar to-15.4 parts per thousand) and CH4 (similar to-29.7 parts per thousand) suggest that both CO2 and CH4 from the Bucha Lake are biotic. The S-M-L (S, M, and L represent sedimentary organic carbon, mantle, and limestone, respectively.) three-component mixing model suggests that no mantle-derived CO2 exists in these samples, which is consistent with the result that He in these gas samples is all crust-derived. CO2 in gas samples from the Beiluhe and the eastern Tuotuo River are relatively enriched in C-13 of CO2 (delta C-13: -8.4 parts per thousand and -5.5 parts per thousand) and low CO2/He-3 (2.3 x 10(9) and 2.4 x 10(9)) as well as CH4/He-3 (5.9 x 10(7) and 3.4 x 10(7)) ratios. These patterns suggest that both CO2 and CH4 are abiotic, demonstrated by the S-M-L three-component mixing model displaying that more than 50% CO2 in these two sites are mantle-derived. CO2-rich gases are discovered in the southern Erdaogou Depot, the branch of Tuotuo River, and the Tanggula Mountain Depot with CO2 exceeding 96 vol.%. The relatively high delta C-13 of CO2 (-4.2 to -7.7 parts per thousand), low CO2/He-3 ratios (7.9 x 10(8)-9.3 x 10(9)), as well as the S-M-L three-component mixing model reveal that CO2 at least partially originates from the mantle source. Only one gas sample from the Tanggula Mountain Depot contains a trace amount of abiotic CH4 (CH4/He-3 = 1.2 x 10(7)) generated by abiotic reduction of mantle-derived CO2. However, the source of He is dominantly crust-derived with only 2.15-5.66% mantle-derived He. The emission of large quantity of mantle-derived CO2 is likely due to the presence of the Hoh Xil-Jinsha River suture and the Cenozoic volcanism in northern Tibet. Nevertheless, the small fraction of mantle-derived He may result from the limited degree of openness at the bottom of fault zones and possibly reflect a geological setting of strong extrusion and crustal thickening.

J	DENICOLA, DM; HOAGLAND, KD; ROEMER, SC				DENICOLA, DM; HOAGLAND, KD; ROEMER, SC			INFLUENCES OF CANOPY COVER ON SPECTRAL IRRADIANCE AND PERIPHYTON ASSEMBLAGES IN A PRAIRIE STREAM	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Influences of the transmission properties of the riparian canopy and the water column on spectral irradiance and periphyton composition were examined at four sites in Otter Creek, a small spring-fed stream in the Sand Hills region of western Nebraska. Values for per cent sky in the canopy at the four sites were: 65.1% (open site), 31.9% (partial shade), 19.0% (shade), and 15.4% (heavy shade). Above canopy, below canopy, and underwater irradiances were measured at 2-nm intervals from 300-800 nm in late morning, mid-day, early afternoon, and late afternoon at each site on a clear day (13 June 1991). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident at the stream surface did not consistently correspond to per cent sky values at the sites because of temporal changes in the penetration of direct sun through small openings in the canopy (sunflecks). The relationship of solar path to canopy structure and orientation was the primary determinant of sunfleck activity. There was very little absorbance of specific wavelengths by the canopy at the open site, but the proportion of blue light (400-500 nm) increased at all sites by late afternoon. At the three shaded sites, the amount of red light (600-700 nm) was proportionally lower underneath the canopy than above it. Underwater PAR was always greater at the open site than at the more shaded sites, but the relationship between canopy cover and underwater irradiance for the more shaded sites varied temporally. The spectral distribution of PAR at the mean depth in Otter Creek (39.7 cm) was similar to that found at shallow depths in clear, oligotrophic lakes, in that there was only a slight maximum transmission in green wavelengths (approximately 550 nm). The degree of temporal variability in the underwater spectral distribution at a site was often greater than differences between sites because of the effects of sunflecks and surface reflection by ripples. Algal chlorophyll a concentrations at the sites were significantly correlated with per cent sky for gravel substrata but not for sand substrata. The flora on both substrata was dominated by diatoms, and the distributions of several species were related to the degree of canopy cover at the sites. The relative importance of the spectral light field versus total PAR in structuring benthic lotic assemblages warrants further study.																			0887-3593					DEC	1992	11	4					391	404																WOS:A1992KE17300005
J	RUBIN, AE; KALLEMEYN, GW				RUBIN, AE; KALLEMEYN, GW			PECORA-ESCARPMENT-91002 - A MEMBER OF THE NEW RUMURUTI (R) CHONDRITE GROUP	METEORITICS												Pecora Escarpment (PCA)91002 is a light/dark-structured chondrite breccia related to Carlisle Lakes and Rumuruti; the meteorite contains approximately 10-20 vol% equilibrated (type-5 and -6) clasts within a clastic groundmass, much of which was metamorphosed to type-3.8 levels. The olivine compositional distribution forms a tight cluster that peaks at Fa38-40; by contrast, low-Ca pyroxene compositions are highly variable. Opaque phases identified in PCA91002 and its paired specimen, PCA91241, include pyrrhotite, pentlandite, pyrite, chromite, ilmenite, metallic Cu and magnetite. The majority of the rock is of shock stage S3-S4; there are numerous sulfide-rich shock veins and 50-mum plagioclase melt pockets. Instrumental neutron activation analysis shows that, unlike Carlisle Lakes and ALH85151, PCA91002 exhibits no Ca enrichment or Au depletion; because PCA91002 is relatively unweathered, it seems probable that the Ca and Au fractionations in Carlisle Lakes and ALH85151 were caused by terrestrial alteration. The Rumuruti-like (formerly Carlisle-Lakes-like) chondrites now include eight separate meteorites. Their geochemical and petrographic similarities suggest that they constitute a distinct chondrite group characterized by unfractionated refractory lithophile abundances (0.95 +/-0.05x CI), high bulk DELTAO-17, a low chondrule/groundmass modal abundance ratio, mean chondrule diameters in the 400 +/- 100 mum range, abundant NiO-bearing ferroan olivine, sodic plagioclase, titanian chromite, abundant pyrrhotite and pentlandite and negligible metallic Fe-Ni. We propose that this group be called R chondrites after Rumuruti, the only fall. The abundant NiO-bearing ferroan olivine grains, the occurrence of Cu-bearing sulfide, and the paucity of metallic Fe-Ni indicate that R chondrites are highly oxidized. It is unlikely that appreciable oxidation took place on the parent body because of the essential lack of plausible oxidizing agents (e.g., magnetite or hydrated silicates). Therefore, oxidation of R chondrite material must have occurred in the nebula. A few type-I porphyritic olivine chondrules containing olivine grains with cores of Fa3-4 composition occur in PCA91002; these chondrules probably formed initially as metallic-Fe-Ni-bearing objects at high nebular temperatures. As temperatures decreased and more metallic Fe was oxidized, these chondrules accreted small amounts of oxidized material and were remelted. The ferroan compositions of the >5-mum olivine grains in the R chondrites reflect equilibration with fine-grained FeO-rich matrix material during parent body metamorphism.																			0026-1114					MAR	1994	29	2					255	263		10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00679.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00679.x													WOS:A1994ND20200015
J	RISACHER, F; FRITZ, B				RISACHER, F; FRITZ, B			QUATERNARY GEOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE SALARS OF UYUNI AND COIPASA, CENTRAL ALTIPLANO, BOLIVIA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The central trough of the Bolivian Altiplano is occupied by two wide salt crusts: the salar of Uyuni, which is probably the largest salt pan in the world (10,000 km2) and the salar of Coipasa (2,500 km2). Both crusts are essentially made of porous halite filled with an interstitial brine very rich in Li, K, Mg, B (up to 4.7 g/l Li, 4.3 g/l B, 30 g/l K and 75 g/l Mg). Lithium reserves are the highest known in the world, around 9 X 10(6) tons. Potassium, magnesium and boron reserves in brines are also important (around 194 x 10(6) tons K, 8 x 10(6) tons B and 211 X 10(6) tons Mg). The crusts are the remnant of saline Lake Tauca (13,000- 10,000 yr BP). Its salinity was estimated approximately at 80 g/l. Its paleochemistry was derived in two ways: (1) by dissolving the present amounts of all chemical components in the former lake volume, and (2) by simulating the evaporation of the major inflows to the basin. The resulting chemical compositions are quite different. The dissolution-derived one is 5 to 50 times less concentrated in Li, K, Mg, B than the evaporation-simulated ones. However all compositions present the same Na and Cl contents. This suggests either a removal of bittern salts or an enrichment of the former lake water in Na and Cl. The most probable interpretation is that Lake Tauca redissolved a salt crust akin to that existing today. Several older lakes have been detected on the Altiplano. Nevertheless, such an explanation only pushes the problem back. It is likely that the anomaly was transferred from one lake to an other. Three hypotheses may be put forward: (1) bittern seepage through bottom sediments, (2) uptake of the missing components by minerals, and (3) leaching of ancient evaporites from the catchment area at the beginning of the lacustrine history of the basin. The excess halite could have been recycled from lake to lake. This latter process seems to be the most effective to explain the large excess of Na and Cl over the bittern solutes - Li, K, Mg and B. The occurrence of almost pure Na-Cl saline springs flowing out from a gypsum diapir in the northern Altiplano gives substantial support to this hypothesis.																			0009-2541					JUN 25	1991	90	3-4					211	231		10.1016/0009-2541(91)90101-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(91)90101-V													WOS:A1991FX14400004
J	Downes, H				Downes, H.			Origin and significance of spinel and garnet pyroxenites in the shallow lithospheric mantle: Ultramafic massifs in orogenic belts in Western Europe and NW Africa	LITHOS												Anhydrous spinel and garnet pyroxenites form a small (< 10%) but integral part of the shallow sub-continental lithospheric mantle. They occur as layers or dykes within tectonically-emplaced ultramafic massifs and display lithologies that range from orthopyroxenite through websterites to clinopyroxenite, with or without olivine. The ultramafic massifs in orogenic belts of western Europe and Morocco contain many different varieties of mantle pyroxenites that show a wide range of major and trace element compositions. Their bulk compositions tend to vary between at least three end-members: two of these are similar to the consitutent clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, while the third component has concentrations of MgO, CaO, Al2O3, TiO2 and Na2O that are close to basaltic levels and may indicate the former presence of trapped basaltic melt. These pyroxenites are probably cumulates in the broadest sense. Nevertheless, some pyroxenites from Beni Bousera and Ronda have whole rock compositions that are similar to that of bulk oceanic crust. Most mantle pyroxenites have LREE-depleted whole-rock REE patterns, although with lower absolute concentrations than MORB or bulk oceanic crust, and most lack Eu anomalies. Trace element patterns in clinopyroxenes from pyroxenites are also usually LREE-depleted. Most clinopyroxenes show depletions in Zr, Hf and Sr, although those from the Cabo Ortegal complex (NW Spain) display LREE-enrichment and significant Sr peaks, attributed to the influence of subduction-related fluids or melts. delta O-18 values for clinopyroxenes from mantle pyroxenites in ultramafic massifs tend to be in the range 5.0-5.8 parts per thousand, i.e. typical mantle values. Rare garnet pyroxenite layers from a few massifs show higher values that reflect recycling of a crustal component. Similarly, most Sr, Nd and Ph isotopic ratios from pyroxenites fall in the depleted mantle field, although with a slightly wider range of values than is typical for shallow sub-continental mantle peridotites from Europe. Most mantle pyroxenites are best explained as products of crystal accumulation of mantle-derived magmas, together with variable amounts of trapped interstitial magma. Others may be the products of interaction between magma and peridotite or older pyroxenite wall-rock. Only samples from a few massifs (e.g. garnet pyroxenites from Beni Bousera and Ronda) display strong evidence of being related to recycled oceanic crust or melts of oceanic crust. Even fewer mantle pyroxenites show good evidence for derivation either by incipient melting of the host peridotite or by metamorphic segregation. Pyroxenites are low-MgO, high CaO, high Al2O3 lithologies that provide a well-documented example of enrichment of the lithosphetic mantle. If such material were recycled into the asthenosphere, mantle pyroxenites might melt preferentially to the host peridotite. However, the precise role of mantle pyroxenites in magmagenesis could be difficult to track, as many of their isotope and trace element compositions (e.g Sm/Nd ratios) are often similar to those of their host mantle peridotites.

Comparative mitogenomic analysis of subterranean and surface amphipods (Crustacea, Amphipoda) with special reference to the family Crangonyctidae	BMC GENOMICS												Mitochondrial genomes play important roles in studying genome evolution, phylogenetic analyses, and species identification. Amphipods (Class Malacostraca, Order Amphipoda) are one of the most ecologically diverse crustacean groups occurring in a diverse array of aquatic and terrestrial environments globally, from freshwater streams and lakes to groundwater aquifers and the deep sea, but we have a limited understanding of how habitat influences the molecular evolution of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Subterranean amphipods likely experience different evolutionary pressures on energy management compared to surface-dwelling taxa that generally encounter higher levels of predation and energy resources and live in more variable environments. In this study, we compared the mitogenomes, including the 13 protein-coding genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, of surface and subterranean amphipods to uncover potentially different molecular signals of energy metabolism between surface and subterranean environments in this diverse crustacean group. We compared base composition, codon usage, gene order rearrangement, conducted comparative mitogenomic and phylogenomic analyses, and examined evolutionary signals of 35 amphipod mitogenomes representing 13 families, with an emphasis on Crangonyctidae. Mitogenome size, AT content, GC-skew, gene order, uncommon start codons, location of putative control region (CR), length of rrnL and intergenic spacers differed between surface and subterranean amphipods. Among crangonyctid amphipods, the spring-dwelling Crangonyx forbesi exhibited a unique gene order, a long nad5 locus, longer rrnL and rrnS loci, and unconventional start codons. Evidence of directional selection was detected in several protein-encoding genes of the OXPHOS pathway in the mitogenomes of surface amphipods, while a signal of purifying selection was more prominent in subterranean species, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the mitogenome of surface-adapted species has evolved in response to a more energy demanding environment compared to subterranean amphipods. Overall, gene order, locations of non-coding regions, and base-substitution rates points to habitat as an important factor influencing the evolution of amphipod mitogenomes.

Using data from 71, mainly shallow (an average mean depth of 3 m), Danish lakes with contrasting total phosphorus concentrations (summer mean 0.02-1.0 mg P L-1), we describe how species richness, biodiversity and trophic structure change along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient divided into five TP classes (class 1-5: < 0.05, 0.05-0.1, 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.4, > 0.4 mg P L-1). 2. With increasing TP, a significant decline was observed in the species richness of zooplankton and submerged macrophytes, while for fish, phytoplankton and floating-leaved macrophytes, species richness was unimodally related to TP, all peaking at 0.1-0.4 mg P L-1. The Shannon-Wiener and the Hurlbert probability of inter-specific encounter (PIE) diversity indices showed significant unimodal relationships to TP for zooplankton, phytoplankton and fish. Mean depth also contributed positively to the relationship for rotifers, phytoplankton and fish. 3. At low nutrient concentrations, piscivorous fish (particularly perch, Perca fluviatilis) were abundant and the biomass ratio of piscivores to plankti-benthivorous cyprinids was high and the density of cyprinids low. Concurrently, the zooplankton was dominated by large-bodied forms and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton and the calculated grazing pressure on phytoplankton were high. Phytoplankton biomass was low and submerged macrophyte abundance high. 4. With increasing TP, a major shift occurred in trophic structure. Catches of cyprinids in multiple mesh size gill nets increased 10-fold from class 1 to class 5 and the weight ratio of piscivores to planktivores decreased from 0.6 in class 1 to 0.10-0.15 in classes 3-5. In addition, the mean body weight of dominant cyprinids (roach, Rutilus rutilus, and bream, Abramis brama) decreased two-threefold. Simultaneously, small cladocerans gradually became more important, and among copepods, a shift occurred from calanoid to cyclopoids. Mean body weight of cladocerans decreased from 5.1 mug in class 1 to 1.5 mug in class 5, and the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton from 0.46 in class 1 to 0.08-0.15 in classes 3-5. Conversely, phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a increased 15-fold from class 1 to 5 and submerged macrophytes disappeared from most lakes. 5. The suggestion that fish have a significant structuring role in eutrophic lakes is supported by data from three lakes in which major changes in the abundance of planktivorous fish occurred following fish kill or fish manipulation. In these lakes, studied for 8 years, a reduction in planktivores resulted in a major increase in cladoceran mean size and in the biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton, while chlorophyll a declined substantially. In comparison, no significant changes were observed in 33 'control' lakes studied during the same period.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2000	45	2					201	218		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00675.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00675.x													WOS:000165086500009

Extant data were used to create a model for classifying bones into distinct habitat categories and to test functional hypotheses related to locomotor behavior in different habitats. The model was then applied to fossils from the Koobi Fora Formation, Kenya, to assess the environmental context during important events in hominin evolution. The use of three-dimensional geometric morphometrics demonstrates significant improvement over traditional methods using caliper measurements. Discriminant function analysis successfully classified 94% of metacarpals and 93% of metatarsals into their correct habitat categories for modern specimens. The protocol was reduced to a subset of landmarks focused on the distal epiphyses. This model produced greater overlap, but classification success rates remained high, with 82% and 83% correct classification for modern metacarpals and metatarsals, respectively. We applied the reduced model to metapodials from Upper Burgi (1.98-1.87 Ma), KBS (1.87-1.56 Ma), and Okote (1.56-1.38 Ma) members in the Koobi Fora Formation. This location is important to understanding human evolution, fossil diversity, and paleoecology. Moreover, previous studies on faunal abundance, paleosol carbonates, and carbon isotopes provide a robust framework to compare the findings of this study. Our analyses classified the majority of fossil specimens as open-habitat dwellers, with a few specimens grouped as closed-adapted, the highest number of these falling within the Okote Member sample. This suggests that open and likely xeric environments dominated the East Turkana region during the Early Pleistocene. These findings are consistent with many previous reconstructions, though with a more open signal for the Okote Member than expected based on bovid abundance research. (c) 2025 The Authors.

More particularly it is used here for a pilot study 1) dealing with the influence of potential peat growth disturbance on charcoal influx interpretation, and 2) proposing a new approach to disentangle regional from local influences on charcoal influx, based on the internal variability of charcoal particle size variations. The latter suggests a fluctuating local to regional main source of charcoal influx to Wildseemoor. Two plausible age-depth models were established based on seven identified radiocarbon-dated macrofos- sils, showing either reduced depositional rates or breaks in deposition during the early- to mid-Holocene and (less extensively) the Middle Ages, that are not visible to the naked eye in the sediment sequence. The Holocene Climatic Optimum, a time interval of particular interest with its climate conditions analogue to future projections, falls directly into an extensive period of reduced accretion or depositional hiatus. This severely impacts the interpretation of the charcoal record for that period but highlights potential impacts of climate variations on peat growth. Regardless which age-depth model is used, phases of high charcoal influx were iden- tified after ca. 5,000 cal BP and can most likely be linked to anthropogenic pressure on the region. The findings of this study may be used in future Holocene fire dynamics reconstructions, as they stress the necessity for high-resolution age control, but also the opportunity to exploit periods of disturbed/halting peat growth as a proxy to detect past periods of climate change. Using the internal variability of charcoal particle size to estimate local versus regional charcoal transport tendency showed promising results and may help push forward charcoal record interpretations in the future.

Lahars can flow down a long distance and cause tremendous disaster at the foot of volcanoes often beyond the areas of primary volcanic impacts of pyroclastic fall and pyroclastic density currents. Therefore, the research on lahar history of active volcanoes approaching from an analysis of a geological record in distal volcanic regions is significant for lahar hazard risk evaluation. Zao volcano has high risks of future eruptions, because volcanic tremors have been detected since 2013. The presence of a crater lake at the summit area, and steep slopes at the high altitude of Zao indicates high potential energy for future lahars, if triggered by an eruption starting underneath the crater lake. This study firstly reports the existence of lahar deposits at the western foot of Zao and discusses the depositional features and the origin of these as well as the lahar hazard risk at this volcano. The lahar deposits were exposed during the archaeological excavation of the Fujiki ruin, western foot of the Zaovolcano. Two major lahar units, L1 and L2, were recognized.Based on the C-14 dating and stratigraphic relationships,the ages of units L1 and L2 were estimated to be <ca. 4.0 and ca. 4.6 cal ka, respectively. The lithology, granulometry, and componentry features of the lahar deposits revealed the depositional featuresand the source materials. The upper part of L1 (L1-1) unit and lower part of L2 (L2-2) unit were deposited from a hyperconcentrated flow, whereas, the lower part of L1 (L1-2) unit and upper part of L2 (L2-1) unit were formed by a debris flow. The sources of both units were phreatomagmatic eruption products that may have erupted shortly before the lahar events. This implies that these eruptions were the most plausible trigger for the lahars. These results suggest that lahar risk will increase especially after the phreatomagmatic eruptions as well as phreatic eruptions, even in the western foot of this volcano.

One of three such vehicles in the advance north, the DUKW was loaded with a field artillery piece and 26 infantry when it was launched from Torbole on the northeastern corner of the lake. During the crossing, in a storm and at midnight, with strong winds and waves and horribly overloaded, the vehicle swamped taking both artillery and men to the bottom, deep below. All the servicemen who were aboard are still listed as missing in action. Cpl. Thomas Hough was the lone survivor, an Ohio lifeguard. In 2004 ProMare, a non-profit underwater archaeology foundation, initiated an expedition to Lake Garda, Italy to locate the remains of the DUKW and the 25 US Servicemen lost on the Lake, but it was only in 2012, after many hours of sonar exploration in an area larger than 7 square kilometers that the vehicle was located at a depth of 276 meters by a local volunteer group, Gruppo Volontari del Garda. In 2018, ProMare teamed up with ICTINEU Submarins, a European builder and operator of small manned submersibles to film and document the DUKW on the lake bottom. The French-flagged three-man mini submarine ICTINEU 3 rated for 1000m depth was used to descend to the sunken craft. During the expedition the ICTINEU 3 submersible made five dives to the wreck. The last dive on this mission was an emotive tribute to the 25 servicemen while the Italian and the American flags were deployed on the DUKW. Over the years, several relatives of the victims of this tragedy have been located by the Association Benach, a local history society. This project is an important documentation of the heroic efforts made by these servicemen to free Italy and will also be used to assist the local authorities in their efforts to monitor and preserve this important military grave site.

J	Lachmund, HG				Lachmund, HG			Cronartium comptoniae Arth. in western North America	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												An account is given of the discovery of this rust in the Pacific N. W. Its range includes the section west of the Cascade Mountains from Ilwaco, Washington, north to Prince Rupert, Brit. Columbia, where the disease is indigenous as in the east. The only known II host within this range is Myrica gale. The I stage has been found only on Pinus contorta. The II host is a plant of very scattered occurrence in bogs and along lake margins where it is of little or no value, inaccessible, and easily overlooked. The I stage of the fungus closely resembles the indigenous and much more widely distributed C. filamentosum, which completely overlaps its range. In the fall a wide distribution of the disease has been noted on M. gale irrespective of the proximity of the I hosts. The distribution is attributed to long-distance dissemination of the rust by wind-borne I spores. Both the I and II hosts occur transcontinentally between the northern limits of the rust in the east and west. It is probable, therefore, that the disease also is transcontinental and that the eastern and western ranges of it are connected. The disease is destructive to young P. contorta in the vicinity of M. gale. As high as 10% or more of the seedlings may be killed in such situations. Studies indicate that only the nodes and internodes originating in the first 4 yr. of life of the seedling are sufficiently susceptible for the establishment of infection. Many of the trees recover. Possible modes of infection and evidence on the development of resistance are discussed. No associations of the alternate host with P. ponderosa, which has shown itself to be highly resistant in eastern nurseries, have been found. Consequently, the rust can not be considered as a serious threat within the native range of this pine. Observations on M. califor-nica at Ilwaco corroborated results of inoculation by others in the east, showing this species of Myrica to be immune. The fact that it range? southward into the Oregon and California pitch- and hard-pine regions is not considered significant in connection with the possible distribution of the rust into these regions.																			0031-949X	1943-7684				MAY	1929	19	5					453	466																WOS:000200838700003

Therefore, it is essential to conduct an in-depth assessment of its dynamics in regions like Nasser Lake, Egypt. Radon activity concentrations were measured using the ionization chamber AlphaGUARD PQ2000PRO, while gamma spectrometry was employed to determine radium content in sediment samples. The results show significant variations in radon activity concentrations across the lake, ranging from 9.59 +/- 0.37 Bq/m(3) (lowest) to 66.24 +/- 2.56 Bq/m(3) (highest). A positive correlation was observed between radium content and radon activity concentrations. Radium content ranged from 10.37 +/- 0.40 to 71.65 +/- 2.77 Bq/kg. Radon exhalation rates for mass and area showed variability. The mass exhalation rates (x 10(-)(3)) ranged from 1.18 +/- 0.05 to 8.13 +/- 0.31 Bq/kg h. The area exhalation rates (x 10(-)(3)) ranged from 20.82 +/- 0.81 to 143.84 +/- 5.56 Bq/m(2) h. The emanation coefficient (x 10(-)(3)) varied between 22.16 +/- 0.86 and 214.98 +/- 8.32, with an average value of 80.6 +/- 3.12. These findings suggest a direct relationship between radium content and radon exhalation, emphasizing the role of sediment composition in radon release. The annual effective dose values, reflecting potential radiation exposure to residents and fishermen, ranged from 0.24 to 1.67 mSv/year, with an average of 0.57 mSv/year. These results fall mostly within the internationally accepted safety thresholds; however, certain locations near the High Dam showed elevated levels, indicating the need for continued monitoring in these areas. This study highlights the need for continuous environmental monitoring and risk mitigation strategies to reduce radon exposure. The findings enhance the understanding of radon dynamics in sediment-rich environments and support risk-informed decision-making frameworks related to environmental health and natural hazard mitigation.

J	Thiergärtner, H				Thiergaertner, Hannes			Statistical analysis of the distribution of point phenomena using the example of Mercury craters	ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN												The application of proved statistical and geostatistical techniques is a useful tool to create introductory overviews of the distribution of geogene or planetogene features defined by their topographic position (punctual occurrences). The methodological approach can be transferred to analyse the distribution of any punctual structures such as craters on planetary surfaces, terrestrial volcanoes, calderas, sinkholes, cenotes, glacial kettle holes, springs and lakes regardless of their shape, size, age, genetic aspects and regardless of the size of the studied area or of the scale of the used map as well. The meteoritic craters on the Mercury were applied for a case study. The terrestrial planet Mercury is well explored by NASA missions. Its surface shows a large number of meteoritic impacts and a few Planitia as extended basins. The Caloris Basin is one of the Planitia which covers the Hermean surface on the northern hemisphere. More than 10,000 recognisable meteoritic impact structures can be observed at the Caloris Basin. The frequency of occurrence has been registered at 225 equal quadratic cells without distinction of their age, size or shape. Gamma, negative-binomial and Weibull distributions are suitable to fit the empirical statistical crater density at a 0.05 significance level. The varying density of meteoritic impacts at the Caloris Basin (Mercury) is apparently determined as random with lower and medium densities dominant. A representation of the spatial pattern of impacts by a raster grey scale map is too rough as to result in detailed information. The spatial distribution of craters per cell is visualised by Ordinary Kriging and shows a high irregularity and remarkably changes between nearby low and high crater densities. Trend surface analysis indicates a slight increase in impact density towards the south and shows a general SW-NE striking zone of a lower crater density beside two maximums in the SE and NW area but these tendencies are statistically not significant. The predominant variation between all cells seems to be caused by long-term random impact processes.																			1860-1804						2020	171	4					567	578		10.1127/zdgg/2020/0246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zdgg/2020/0246													WOS:000599174900008

This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOCS by collecting a total of 1219 topsoil samples in southern Jiangsu Province of China in 1980, 2000 and 2015, and compared the performance of three predictive models: random forest (RF), RothC, and a hybrid model of RF-RothCEnKF. The hybrid model integrated outputs from the process-based RothC model and the data-driven RF model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for sequential model state updates. Results showed that the three models presented similar spatial patterns of SOCS from 1980 to 2015, with relatively higher SOCS mainly distributed in the areas surrounding Taihu Lake. The mean SOCS change rates estimated by the RF-RothCEnKF model represented an overall net increase of 0.04 t C ha-1 yr.-1 during that period. The RF-RothCEnKF model exhibited high prediction accuracy, with an R2 of .52, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.38 t C ha-1, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.13 t C ha-1 in 2015. This highlighted the RF-RothCEnKF's ability to enhance performance when the individual RF model (R2 = .47, MAE = 7.66 t C ha-1, and RMSE = 9.42 t C ha-1) and the RothC (R2 = .13, MAE = 8.77 t C ha-1, and RMSE = 10.87 t C ha-1) fell short. Our findings may not only provide a framework for integrating process-based and machine learning models to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of SOCS modelling in areas affected by intensive human activities, but also offer some guidance for developing sustainable agricultural practices and carbon management strategies in complex environmental settings.					; Chen, Jian/LCD-3931-2024	Zhao, Yongcun/0000-0001-6747-1665; Chen, Jian/0000-0002-7633-570X													0266-0032	1475-2743				OCT	2024	40	4							e13127	10.1111/sum.13127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.13127													WOS:001368785900001

Geology, Petrology, and Mineralogy of Hornfels-like Rocks (Beerbachite) in the Early Paleozoic Olkhon Collisional Orogen (West Baikal Area, Russia)	MINERALS												Geological, mineralogical, and petrological observations are reported for hornfels-like fine-grained granular mafic rocks in the Early Paleozoic Olkhon collisional orogen (West Baikal area, Russia). The rocks are composed of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, amphibole, plagioclase, and ilmenite; some samples also contain olivine, phlogopite, spinel, and titanomagnetite (Opx+Cpx+Amp+Pl+Ilm +/- Ol +/- Bt +/- Spl +/- Ti-Mag). There are three occurrences of these rocks in the area: a 500 m x 1000 m field in the Shirokaya Valley, another occurrence within the Tazheran Massif (a complex of igneous and metamorphic rocks), and dismembered dikes on the southern margin of the Birkhin gabbro intrusion. The Shirokaya field is located between two 500 Ma intrusions of the Birkhin gabbro; the Tazheran occurrence coexists with syenite, including nepheline syenite, subalkaline gabbro, and marble protrusions; and the dismembered dikes coexist with carbonates and display progressive alteration of dolerite through typical granular varieties. The dikes associated with granite and marble veins mark a part of a large arc-shaped shear zone that traverses the whole intrusive body produced by rotation of a rigid gabbro block during the peak of tectonic deformation at 470-460 Ma. All three occurrences of the hornfels-like rocks lack any evident source of heat that would be responsible for the thermal alteration of the igneous protolith. We hypothesize that the precursor, subvolcanic dolerite, may have undergone autometamorphism maintained by self-generated heat. Mafic magma intruded during high-rate strike-slip faulting, which caused rapid recrystallization of magmatic minerals and produced the observed metamorphic structures. Proceeding from the controversy in the formation mechanisms, with a heat source required for hornfels but lacking from the sampled occurrences of hornfels-like rocks, we suggest identifying the latter as beerbachite, though the term has mostly fallen into disuse. The reason is that the Olkhon rocks we study have a mineralogy, structure, and texture that are perfectly identical to those of beerbachites described in publications from the first half of the 20th century.

J	Cantoral-Uriza, EA; Sanjurjo, MA				Cantoral-Uriza, Enrique A.; Aboal Sanjurjo, Marina			Benthic algal communities of some sources of the Oliva-Pego marsh, Valencia, Spain	LIMNETICA												The Oliva-Pego marsh is an important rice and citrus growing area in the Spanish Levant. The marsh is situated in the area of maximal rainfall of the Autonomous Community of Valencia and has high temperatures year-round. This marsh presents a conductivity gradient that goes from fresh water to brackish in its main inflowing streams, which gives way to a large variety of macro and microalgae, that form characteristic groups in the different conditions. Several of these species show tropical affinity. The results of two samplings in 1999 are presented, which were carried out in the most contrasting environmental zones-those of minimum and maximum rainfall. In each sampling site (four water bodies: Bullent River, Ullal River close to the Bullent, Bassa Sineu and the Font Sallat) pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, current velocity, depth, and cationic and anionic contents of the water were assessed. The communities studied were constituted by structural species of Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Diatoms were the most diverse group, while Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae formed the visible elements. As structural elements, the presence of Homoeothrix juliana (Meneghini) Kirchner and Schizothrix fasciculata (Nageli) Gomont was to be noteed in oligohaline waters and Chaetophorales, Phormidium tenue (Meneghini) Gomont, Calothrix pulvinata Kutzing and Pleurocapsales in slightly brackish waters. The diatoms Encyonopsis microcephala Grunow Krammer, Cymbella affinis Kutzing and Navicula cryptotenella Lange-Bertalot were responsible for their chlorophyll c contribution in two streams (Rio Bullent and Ullal), while Hyalodiscus whitneyi Ehrenberg. Nitzschia gracilis Hantzsch, Navicella pusilla (Grunow) Krammer and Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta (Ehrenberg) Grunow were responsible in Font Salat, and Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (C. Agardh) Lange-Bertalot was responsible in Bassa Sineu. Characteristic communities of the different degrees of water salinity were observed in the different water bodies, composed of species with affinity for those conditions. The sources in the marsh are fundamental as consistent providers of water, with a constancy in the species within the community. This is why they can be used as equilibrium indicators of the system, in order to understand the combined effects of salinity and water regime on marsh biodiversity. This information is important as an environmental referent for water policies and legislative measures with water quality indicators of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Community (EC), and offers a precedent for the improvement of ecological quality of both freshwater and marine systems.

Variability in freshwater, estuarine, and marine residence of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka within the Copper and Bering River Deltas, Alaska	SOCKEYE SALMON EVOLUTION, ECOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Sockeye Salmon Ecology, Evolution, Life History, and Management	SEP 13, 2005	Anchorage, AK					Variability in the duration of freshwater and marine residence of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka has been recognized for some time and is the basis for separating the species into different life history strategies. We analyzed the results of annual age-composition surveys of spawning sockeye salmon conducted by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in the Copper River Delta and Bering River regions of southcentral Alaska from 1990 to 2004 to quantify the variability in freshwater and marine residence time. Significant variation both years and locations was detected by multivariate analysis of similarity. The two most common life history forms were sockeye salmon that spent one winter in freshwater after emergence followed by either 2 or 3 years in marine waters before returning to spawn (1.2 or 1.3 European age notation). Sockeye salmon exhibiting these two strategies accounted for 36% and 46%, respectively, of all sockeye salmon aged over the 14 year surveys (n = 93,936). Sockeye salmon spending less than 1 year in freshwater following emergence (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) accounted for 14% of all adult sockeye salmon surveyed compared to 82% that spent 1 year in freshwater (1.1, 1.2,1.3,1.4) and 4% that spent 2 years (2.1, 2.2, 2.3). Only one fish was aged that spent 3 years in freshwater. Large interannual and among site variability in the proportion of fishes that spend 0 years in freshwater was apparent. The magnitude of 0-type sockeye salmon was best correlated with site locations (sloughs had a higher proportion than lake sites). Despite the low average contribution of 0-type sockeye salmon to the adult spawning population, large numbers of sockeye salmon leave freshwater as age-0 fry and parr. These sockeye salmon can be found in the estuarine waters near the outflow of major sloughs and rivers for a 45-d period coinciding with peak out-migration from freshwater areas. All juvenile stages of sockeye salmon seem to have similar residence time in the estuary, suggesting that out-migration at an early age does not lead to longer nearshore residence time.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-88-9				2007	54						87	+																WOS:000246659300008
J	Frey, L; Frei, C				Frey, Louis; Frei, Christoph			Interpolation of Hourly Surface Air Temperature-Application of a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Model in Complex Terrain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												At present, grid datasets of in situ climate observations are mostly constructed in daily time resolution. An extension to sub-daily resolution is desirable, particularly for surface air temperature, in order to represent diurnal variations. Here, we devise and investigate a method to produce hourly temperature grids in a region of complex topography (Switzerland). The method, a dynamic linear model (DLM), extends a model widely used in spatial climatology (kriging with external drift, KED), into a spatio-temporal statistical model, while preserving its flexibility to adapt to the specifics of a region. We configure the method with covariates for known mesoscale effects (inversions, cold-air pooling, valley- and lake effects), assuming quasi-harmonic evolutions in the related coefficients. The method is applied to a wintertime inversion episode and a summertime high-pressure episode, with data from 259 stations. We compare DLM to a sequentially applied KED and evaluate the predictions in cross-validation. The results demonstrate that DLM can accurately reproduce complex spatio-temporal variations, including the gradual build-up of an inversion and the distinct temperature patterns between day- and night-time. The mean absolute error ranges from 0.65 degrees C in flat and hilly terrain (both episodes) to 1.6 degrees C in mountain valleys in winter. DLM yields temporally more continuous effect coefficients than KED, which corroborates the expected advantage from spatio-temporal modelling. However, the prediction errors of DLM are not significantly smaller, except in experiments where the station data was artificially reduced. It seems that the spatio-temporal approach had little advantage over a spatial model in the data-rich conditions of our application. However, its advantage may be more prominent in conditions with fewer observations or with more covariates. DLM is a versatile method for developing sub-daily climate datasets and this study provides valuable insight on its adoption to the climatic conditions of a specific region.

S.; Wagner, Tyler			Freshwater corridors in the conterminous United States: A coarse-filter approach based on lake-stream networks	ECOSPHERE												Maintaining regional-scale freshwater connectivity is challenging due to the dendritic, easily fragmented structure of freshwater networks, but is essential for promoting ecological resilience under climate change. Although the importance of stream network connectivity has been recognized, lake-stream network connectivity has largely been ignored. Furthermore, protected areas are generally not designed to maintain or encompass entire freshwater networks. We applied a coarse-filter approach to identify potential freshwater corridors for diverse taxa by calculating connectivity scores for 385 lake-stream networks across the conterminous United States based on network size, structure, resistance to fragmentation, and dam prevalence. We also identified 2080 disproportionately important lakes for maintaining intact networks (i.e., hubs; 2% of all network lakes) and analyzed the protection status of hubs and potential freshwater corridors. Just 3% of networks received high connectivity scores based on their large size and structure (medians of 1303 lakes, 498.6 km north-south stream distance), but these also contained a median of 454 dams. In contrast, undammed networks (17% of networks) were considerably smaller (medians of six lakes, 7.2 km north-south stream distance), indicating that the functional connectivity of the largest potential freshwater corridors in the conterminous United States currently may be diminished compared with smaller, undammed networks. Network lakes and hubs were protected at similar rates nationally across different levels of protection (8%-18% and 6%-20%, respectively), but were generally more protected in the western United States. Our results indicate that conterminous United States protection of major freshwater corridors and the hubs that maintain them generally fell short of the international conservation goal of protecting an ecologically representative, well-connected set of fresh waters (& GE;17%) by 2020 (Aichi Target 11). Conservation planning efforts might consider focusing on restoring natural hydrologic connectivity at or near hubs, particularly in larger networks, less protected, or biodiverse regions, to support freshwater biodiversity conservation under climate change.					; Wagner, Tyler/MIU-0726-2025	McCullough, Ian/0000-0002-6832-674X; Hanly, Patrick/0000-0001-9435-9572; King, Katelyn/0000-0001-5471-842X													2150-8925					DEC	2022	13	12							e4326	10.1002/ecs2.4326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4326													WOS:000899030200001

It collapsed in the mid 1940s. Modern-day limitations to natural recruitment are offshore spawning habitat degradation (sedimentation of reefs), blockage by dams to tributary spawning grounds, and likely the predatory effects of normative planktivores such as alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax. Walleyes have always been the principal predator in the bay's ecosystem, and with their numbers depressed, the fish community is overpopulated with prey fish species precipitating a variety of ecological problems. Stocking of about 0.8 million spring walleye fingerlings per year, beginning in the early 1980s, helped to re-establish a walleye population and fishery. Some natural recruitment has returned, mostly from spawning in rivers below the first impoundment. Research, however, has determined that the walleye population remains heavily dependent on stocking, with about 80% of the local recruitment attributed to hatchery propagated fish. The walleye population is still well below the carrying capacity of the bay's habitat for adult walleyes and the prey base. New recovery initiatives have been developed recently for walleyes in the bay with emphasis on restoration of access to tributary spawning grounds. These measures, however, may be limited in their benefit as long as normative planktivores remain abundant in the bay. Increased predation rates on the alewife and rainbow smelt populations are needed so as to encourage better survival of naturally reproduced walleye fry. Increased stocking is rationalized as the best means with which to initially achieve a balance of predator and prey in the bay, thereby setting up a more favorable environment for natural recruitment. While walleye stocking is a common practice in North America, this approach is somewhat novel in that the objectives are not just to contribute to the creel, but to increase predatory pressure on an overabundant prey base, especially the normative planktivores. The goal is to help manipulate the fish community biologically to an assemblage that favors native prey species thereby minimizing some of the obstacles to better survival of naturally reproduced walleye larvae. Higher predation rates may also make the Saginaw Bay ecosystem more resistant and resilient to the effects of any future exotic invaders.																			0892-2284		1-888569-69-7				2004	44						105	112																WOS:000228130200008
J	CLARKE, JA; JOHNSON, RE				CLARKE, JA; JOHNSON, RE			BIOGEOGRAPHY OF WHITE-TAILED PTARMIGAN (LAGOPUS-LEUCURUS) - IMPLICATIONS FROM AN INTRODUCED POPULATION IN THE SIERRA-NEVADA	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												The alpine community of the Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.A., presents a unique set of biogeographic questions in that numerous cosmopolitan species and species present in other North American cordillera are absent in this range. The white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus (Richardson) is a primary alpine species that was historically absent in the Sierra Nevada until seventy-two birds were introduced in 1971-72 from the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, U.S.A. This study investigates whether ptarmigan could have once inhabited the Sierra Nevada and later become extinct in the range or if the species never successfully colonized the Sierra Nevada. The strongest argument for the former absence of this species in the Sierra Nevada is that barriers east and north prevented the birds from colonizing the range. Pollen records and fossil evidence indicate that the Great Basin presented this terrestrial alpine species with many dispersal barriers between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. From the Mid-Pleistocene to the present, barriers in the Great Basin have existed in forms ranging from extensive woodlands and great pluvial lakes to deserts. From the Pleistocene to the present, the principle barriers to ptarmigan movements form the north were the Columbia River and its gorge and the relatively low altitude of the South Cascades which provide a paucity of suitable alpine habitat. Currently, the Sierra Nevadan alpine is suitable for ptarmigan survival as determined by the breeding success of the introduced population which does not differ significantly from natural populations in the Rocky Mountains. Yet, deep spring snowpack in the Sierra Nevada negatively affects the birds' breeding success (P < 0.05). If, as hypothesized, Pleistocene snows were consistently heavier in the Sierra Nevada than today, the establishment of a population of ptarmigan may not have been successful. In the Holocene, temperatures, exceeding present conditions in the Sierra Nevada may have subjected the birds to critical heat stress since the species is intolerant of high temperatures. Thus, the Sierra Nevada may have been unsuitable for ptarmigan survival in the past in addition to being inaccessible.																			0305-0270	1365-2699				NOV	1990	17	6					649	656		10.2307/2845146	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2845146													WOS:A1990EP21700008
J	Hill, CA				Hill, Carol A.			Overview of the Cenozoic geomorphic evolution of the Colorado River through Glen Canyon and Upper Colorado River Corridor and how it relates to the age and origin of Grand Canyon, Colorado Plateau, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The overall purpose of this paper is to integrate the geomorphic evolution of Glen Canyon and Upper Colorado River Corridor with that of Grand Canyon in order to address two key enigmas: why did the Colorado River not arrive at the mouth of Grand Canyon until 5.5 Ma, and how did the Colorado River cross the Kaibab arch high? This evolution was approached from three different perspectives: (1) by reviewing geologic investigations in the Glen Canyon area from the late 1800s to the present; (2) by explaining how a paleo-Colorado River constrained within a lake or a chain of lakes on the Colorado Plateau is necessary for the Colorado River to have arrived at the mouth of Grand Canyon ca. 5.5 Ma; and (3) by proposing how the incision rates in Marble Canyon, Glen Canyon, and central Colorado Plateau may be related to a prolonged base-level fall at the Confluence of the ColoradoLittle Colorado rivers starting at similar to 5.5 Ma, to a karst-connection model of a Colorado River crossing under the Kaibab arch, or to a lake-overflow model. An attempt was made to find field and analytic evidence for a pre-5.5 Ma Miocene lake along the north to west sides of Navajo Mountain, Utah, where high pediment surfaces still remain along the Colorado River, but from field investigations, Al-26-Be-10 cosmogenic dating, and SEM analysis, no direct evidence for a past lake was substantiated. However, a number of lines of indirect evidence are discussed supporting the possible existence of a Miocene lake or chain of lakes along Glen Canyon and Upper Colorado River Corridor. A lake-overflow model is compared with a karst-connection model as to how the Colorado River might have crossed the Kaibab arch.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				NOV 15	2023	441								108899	10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108899		SEP 2023											WOS:001085995100001

Risks of Downstream Flooding of the Irkutsk Hydropower Plant in Regulating the Lake Baikal Level	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This paper presents findings on modeling the flood zone boundaries and assessing the resultant damage in the downstream of the Irkutsk Hydropower Plant (IHPP) due to high water flows through it which are possible in high-water years when the Lake Baikal level goes beyond the established range. A description of the relief model and the data sources used are provided. The hydraulic model of steady flow of the Angara River, which is developed in the form of automatic generation of a large number of cross sections by calculating their characteristics, is presented. Currently, downstream flooding is observed when flow rate of IHPP is 2800 m(3)/s, while the bulk of possible flooding occurs in the city of Irkutsk. The results were verified using actual satellite image data. The paper presents the estimates of flooded areas and objects (buildings and structures) susceptible to flooding at various flow rates of the IHPP. Based on the estimates for the areas of the objects and the length of utility lines, which fall into the flood zones when the flow of IHPP ranges from 2800 to 6000 m(3)/s, socioeconomic damage and losses for the downstream pool as a whole were determined. The results showed an increase in the damage starting with a flow rate of IHPP of 4000 m(3)/s and its much higher increase with a flow rate of 4500 m(3)/s. The estimates for the damage due to elevated flow rates of IHPP are compared with the estimates of damage in the upstream pool, which can occur when the level of Lake Baikal rises under similar water conditions. The critical level for the upstream pool is 457.20 m (according to the Pacific Elevation System). The critical flow rate for the downstream pool is 4000-4500 m(3)/s. These levels and flow rates are within the range of comparable damage in the upstream and downstream pools and have a probability of about 2%.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				DEC	2024	45	4					427	435		10.1134/S1875372824700756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1875372824700756													WOS:001440008800006

K.; Rattray, Jayne E.; Van der Putten, Nathalie			A South Atlantic island record uncovers shifts in westerlies and hydroclimate during the last glacial	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Changes in the latitudinal position and strength of the Southern Hemisphere westerlies (SHW) are thought to be tightly coupled to important climate processes, such as cross-equatorial heat fluxes, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the bipolar seesaw, Southern Ocean ventilation and atmospheric CO2 levels. However, many uncertainties regarding magnitude, direction, and causes and effects of past SHW shifts still exist due to lack of suitable sites and scarcity of information on SHW dynamics, especially from the last glacial. Here we present a detailed hydroclimate multiproxy record from a 36.4-18.6 kyr old lake sediment sequence on Nightingale Island (NI). It is strategically located at 37 degrees S in the central South Atlantic (SA) within the SHW belt and situated just north of the marine Subtropical Front (SF). This has enabled us to assess hydroclimate changes and their link to the regional climate development as well as to large-scale climate events in polar ice cores. The NI record exhibits a continuous impact of the SHW, recording shifts in both position and strength, and between 36 and 31 ka the westerlies show high latitudinal and strength-wise variability possibly linked to the bipolar seesaw. This was followed by 4 kyr of slightly falling tem-peratures, decreasing humidity and fairly southerly westerlies. After 27 ka temperatures decreased 3-4 degrees C, marking the largest hydroclimate change with drier conditions and a variable SHW position. We note that periods with more intense and southerly-positioned SHW seem to be related to periods of increased CO2 outgassing from the ocean, while changes in the cross-equatorial gradient during large northern temperature changes appear as the driving mechanism for the SHW shifts. Together with coeval shifts of the South Pacific westerlies, our results show that most of the Southern Hemisphere experienced simultaneous atmospheric circulation changes during the latter part of the last glacial. Finally we can conclude that multiproxy lake records from oceanic islands have the potential to record atmospheric variability coupled to large-scale climate shifts over vast oceanic areas.					; Sjolte, Jesper/N-7833-2019; Stocker, Thomas/B-1273-2013; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008; Yang, Hong/C-1739-2008	Van der Putten, Nathalie/0000-0002-0271-9321; Sjolte, Jesper/0000-0003-0870-5331; Kylander, Malin/0000-0001-8787-5069; Adolphi, Florian/0000-0003-0014-8753; Yamoah, Afrifa Kweku Kyei/0000-0001-7488-0459; Rattray, Jayne/0000-0001-7086-2237; Ljung, Karl/0000-0002-4290-7933; Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916													1814-9324	1814-9332				NOV 15	2019	15	6					1939	1958		10.5194/cp-15-1939-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-15-1939-2019													WOS:000497758900001

For birds, holding captive-reared juveniles through their first winter is often believed to increase survival by sheltering them from expected high mortality in the wild. However, extended care in captivity requires time and expense and can be associated with the development of tame behaviors; those costs should be weighed against potential benefits. As part of a strategic conservation program for the endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus), we released 265 sparrows raised under managed care into the Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area population in Florida during 2019-2021. Thirty-two of 181 (18%) sparrows released as hatch-years recruited (i.e., were confirmed to be paired and breeding), whereas only 4 of 84 (5%) sparrows released as second-years recruited. Logistic regression analysis found support for release age class and mass on recruitment probability, but release age class was the only variable included in all the top three models. Based on the most-parsimonious model, when mass was held at its mean value (16.47 g), the odds of recruitment for hatch-year birds were 4.65 times (95% CI: 2.04, 11.75) that of second-year birds. Despite being translocated only a few weeks before the onset of breeding, second-year birds failed to recruit into the breeding population at rates comparable to individuals translocated 6-8 months earlier as nutritionally independent fledglings. It is unclear whether low recruitment for older sparrows was the result of higher mortality or dispersal. We discuss potential reasons why younger Florida grasshopper sparrows may be developmentally better suited to adapt to novel environments and recommend more research on the role of neuroplasticity during early learning periods and its influence on translocation outcomes.																			2045-7758					JUL	2025	15	7							e71662	10.1002/ece3.71662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71662								40584662					WOS:001517559100001
J	Currell, MJ; Cartwright, I; Bradley, DC; Han, DM				Currell, Matthew J.; Cartwright, Ian; Bradley, Dean C.; Han, Dongmei			Recharge history and controls on groundwater quality in the Yuncheng Basin, north China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Environmental isotopes and water quality indicators (e.g. TDS and NO(3) contents) were used to characterize the age, recharge history and controls on the quality of groundwater resources in the Yuncheng Basin, north China, where extensive extraction occurs for agriculture and domestic supply. delta(18)O and delta(2)H values as low as -10.6%. and -73 parts per thousand, respectively, together with low radiocarbon activities (<20 pmC) show that deep groundwater comprises palaeowaters largely recharged in the late Pleistocene (similar to 10 to 22 ka B.P.) under a cooler climate than the present. Shallow groundwater has higher radiocarbon activities (>70 pmC), indicating a significant component of modern (post-1950s) recharge. The shallow groundwater has higher delta(18)O and delta(2)H values (up to -8.1%. and -54 parts per thousand) that are similar to those in modern summer monsoon rainfall, indicating that current recharge is via direct infiltration and/or leakage of ephemeral streams during heavy rain events. Historic recharge rates estimated using radiocarbon ages are between 1 and 10 mm/year, corresponding to <2% of local rainfall, which is lower than estimates of modern recharge nearby based on tritium data. The relationship between groundwater delta(18)O values and (14)C ages is similar to that observed in groundwater from other basins in northern China, confirming that much deep groundwater in the region is palaeowater, and suggesting that a broad scale assessment of groundwater residence times may be made from delta(18)O and delta(2)H values. Most deep groundwater has low TDS and nitrate concentrations (median 1090 mg/L and 1.8 mg/L, respectively), while shallow groundwater has TDS contents of up to 8450 mg/L (median 2010 mg/L) and NO(3) concentrations up to 630 mg/L (median 31 mg/L). A lack of enrichment in delta(18)O values in the high salinity shallow groundwater indicates that transpiration by crops and possibly minor mineral dissolution are the major salinisation processes, rather than evaporation or leakage from salt lakes. The majority of nitrate in groundwater has delta(15)N (NO3) values between 0.8 parts per thousand and 5.0 parts per thousand and delta(18)O(NO3) values between 1.8 parts per thousand and 4.1 parts per thousand, indicating that synthetic fertilizers are the main source of elevated NO(3) concentrations. Increasing residence times from east-to-west in deep groundwaters reflect the historic regional flow pattern in the basin. However, present-day flow is now dictated by a large cone of depression that has formed due to intensive deep groundwater pumping since the 1980s. High downward vertical hydraulic gradients (up to 0.45) have also developed as a result of this pumping, promoting downwards leakage of shallow water, indicated by high nitrate concentrations (>20 mg/L) in some deep wells (>180 m). Preferential leakage has occurred near the Linyi fault, in the northern Sushui River Basin. Salinisation, nitrate contamination and excessive drawdown of deep groundwater are major concerns for the future of the groundwater resources in this region. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The following results are obtained. (1) Three tertiary sequences (SQ1-SQ3) are identified in the Lower Cretaceous Itapema-Barra Velha of the M block. During the depositional period of SQ1, the rift basement faults controlled the stratigraphic distribution pattern of thick on both sides and thin in the middle. The strata overlapped to uplift in the early stage. During the depositional period of SQ2-SQ3, the synsedimentary faults controlled the paleogeomorphic reworking process with subsidence in the northwest and uplifting in the northeast, accompanied with the relative fall of lake level. (2) The Lower Cretaceous in the M block was deposited in a littoral-shallow lake, with the lithofacies paleogeographic pattern transiting from the inner clastic shoals and outer shelly shoals in SQ1 to the alternation of mounds and shoals in SQ2-SQ3. (3) Under the joint control of relative lake-level fluctuation, synsedimentary faults and volcanic activity, the shelly shoals in SQ1 tend to accumulated vertically in the raised area, and the mound-shoal complex in SQ2-SQ3 tends to migrate laterally towards the slope-break belt due to the reduction of accommodation space. (4) The evolution pattern of high-energy mounds and shoals, which were vertically accumulated in the early stage and laterally migrated in the later stage, controlled the transformation of high-quality reservoirs from "centralized" to "ring shaped" distribution. The research findings clarify the sedimentary patterns of mounds and shoals and the distribution of favorable reservoirs in the fault-controlled lacustrine isolated platform, providing support for the deepwater hydrocarbon exploration in the subsalt carbonate rocks in the Santos Basin.					li, Peijia/MSY-9337-2025; Zhao, Junfeng/MGW-1210-2025														2096-4803	1876-3804				AUG	2025	52	4					982	1000		10.1016/S1876-3804(25)60617-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1876-3804(25)60617-3		AUG 2025											WOS:001575665100001
J	Mestdagh, T; Poort, J; De Batist, M				Mestdagh, Thomas; Poort, Jeffrey; De Batist, Marc			The sensitivity of gas hydrate reservoirs to climate change: Perspectives from a new combined model for permafrost-related and marine settings	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Gas hydrate reservoirs store large quantities of gas in sediments on continental margins, in deep lakes, and in continental and relic sub-shelf permafrost. The gas hydrate structure is only stable at sufficiently low temperature and high pressure, and may therefore collapse under changing climatic conditions. If a temperature rise or pressure drop (e.g. through falling sea level) is effective enough to dissociate hydrate deposits, methane (the most common gas component in hydrates and a potent greenhouse gas) is released from the hydrate structure and may eventually enter into the atmosphere. This may generate a positive feedback effect, as resulting enhanced greenhouse gas levels would additionally warm the atmosphere and hence maintain or reinforce hydrate dissociation. The significance of this mechanism has been debated over the past decades, often within the framework of geologically rapid Quaternary climatic oscillations and present-day climate warming. An extensive set of studies has addressed the climate-sensitivity of gas hydrate reservoirs in various study areas and geological settings, and by means of various approaches. No real consensus has yet been reached on the matter. In this study, we seek to evaluate the sensitivity of gas hydrate reservoirs to changes in global climate from a more general perspective, by firstly reviewing the available literature, and secondly developing a new numerical model to quantify gas hydrate destabilization under changing environmental conditions. Qualities of the model include the wide applicability to both marine and permafrost-related hydrate reservoirs and the integrative approach, combining existing hydrate formation models with a dissocation model that accounts for the consumption of latent heat during hydrate dissociation. To determine which settings are most vulnerable, and to acquire insight into the extent, fashion and rates of hydrate dissociation, we apply the model to four distinct types of hydrate reservoirs across a hypothetic high-latitude continental margin under two specific cases of climate change: the last deglaciation following the Last Glacial Maximum and present-day climate warming. The simulations indicate that hydrates on the upper continental slope and in association with thin, sub-shelf permafrost are most sensitive to the imposed climatic variations, whereas deepwater and onshore permafrost-related reservoirs react in a more stable way. However, the deep (i.e. at several tens to hundreds of meters subsurface depth) stratigraphic-type hydrates considered in this study constitute by far the largest fraction of the global gas hydrate volume, but dissociate on slow timescales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, even in the most sensitive environments. In contrast, shallow (i.e. at, or a few meters below the surface or seafloor) structural-type hydrates are able to respond to climatic variations on sub-millennial timescales, but the volumes of gas they may release are probably insignificant to the global carbon cycle and climate. Quaternary and present-day climate change do affect the stability of gas hydrate reservoirs, but at long timescales where hydrate volumes are large, and on short timescales where hydrate volumes are small. Consequently, gas hydrates dissociate to an extent that is too small or at a pace that is too slow to create a strong positive feedback effect. While the release of methane from the disintegration of gas hydrates is observed on different margins today, it is not likely to have played a leading role in Quaternary climatic variations or to become a significant process in the coming centuries as a result of present-day rising temperatures.

Accumulation of Radionuclides and Heavy Metals in Vegetables and Greens in Zones of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant	EURASIAN SYMPOSIUM ON VEGETABLES AND GREENS	Acta Horticulturae				Eurasian Symposium on Vegetables and Greens	OCT 16-20, 2012	Yerevan, ARMENIA	Int Soc Hort Sci				Artificial radionuclides (ARN - Sr-90-T-1/2=28.6 years, Cs-137-T-1/2=30.1 years) and heavy metals (HM - Fe, Mn, Ni, Mo, Pb, V, Ti, Cu, Cr) can penetrate into the human organism through the water-soil-plant chain and cause different diseases. The Armenian nuclear power plant (ANPP) is in a densely populated area of the Ararat Valley with intensive agriculture. ANPP uses the water of the River Metsamor. The waters that come out of the ANPP fall into the Metsamor River which is used for crop irrigation. Since 1996 we have carried out radiomonitoring researches in water-soil-plant ecosystems in zones of the ANPP within a radius of 215 km. The aim of our studies is to develop practical radio protective strategies to achieve ecologically pure food production. Our investigation has shown that the content of Sr-90 fluctuated between 3.7-8.8 Bq/kg and Cs-137 between 5.7-13.1 Bq/kg in spices crops (basil, celery, dill, parsley, lettuce). The Sr-90 content fluctuated between 1.0-7.2 Bq/kg and Cs-137 between 3.5-7.5 Bq/kg in the other crops (pepper, tomato, eggplant, vegetable marrow, string beans, cucumber, potato, cauliflower, onion). HM contents in spicy crops fluctuated widely (416.7-1513.9 mg/kg; in other crops 125.2-744.3 mg/kg). This is likely due to the joint influence of factors vegetation period, mineral nutrition, rooting patterns, watering regime, anatomical structure and size of leaves. We can conclude that ARN and HM penetrated into crops through irrigation water (artesian, Metsamor River, Akna Lake), from the soil as well as the atmosphere (dust, smoke and aerosol). Frequent watering of spicy herbs promoted ARN and HM migration from irrigation water and soils in the hot and dry soil-climate conditions of the Ararat Valley. It is important to note that ARN content did not exceed the MACL in planting material, while the HM (Fe, Ni, Cr, Pb) exceed edit.																			0567-7572		978-94-62610-20-0				2014	1033																							WOS:000343871600007

These papers generated significant interest in how public management certification programs could provide a vehicle for the professional development and education of the public sector workforce around the world. The authors review the development and operation of the CPM Program in the US and believe that the US CPM experience could possibly serve as a relevant model for Chinese Public Administrators to review. This paper will examine in detail the concepts and the curriculum of the Certified Public Manager (CPM) Program both in the US and in Texas. It will also discuss the newly created Section for Certified Public Management which has been established under the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA). In addition the paper will identify the major organizational components of CPM such as the National Certified Public Manager (CPM) Consortium and the American Academy of Certified Public Managers (AACPM). In addition the goals and objectives of ASPA's Section for Certified Public Management will be explored as a vehicle for the delivery of professional development and educational services. The Texas Certified Public Manager (CPM) Program is one of about 30 CPM Programs which fall under the umbrella of the National Certified Public Manager Consortium. The CPM Program has been operating in the US for more than 25 years. In addition to the State CPM Programs, the US National Government offers a CPM Program for federal employees and the City of Washington DC offers a CPM Program to District of Columbia employees.

The Indus River is one of the world's great rivers and the longest one in Pakistan. It originates from Tibet and after draining through the major length of Pakistan, falls into the Arabian Sea near Karachi. The major tributaries of the Indus River upstream Chashma include rivers: Kabul, Kalpani, Haro, Soan, Kurram and Tochi. The tributaries downstream Chashma include the rivers:Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Bcas/Sutlej. The Indus River is not only a major source of recharge to the groundwater reservoirs along its course but it also provides water to the world's largest earth-filled dam namely 'Tarbcla Dam' for hydro-clectric power generation. At various barrages along its course such as Chashma Barrage, its water is regulated for canal irrigation. The variations in the concentrations of pollutants and the discharge of the Indus River depend upon those of its tributaries and the type of industrial and agricultural activities alongside. From a view point of groundwater resources development and environmental pollution, it is thus very important to determine the origin of subsurface water and its contaminants, recharge mechanisms, and interaction between aquifers recharged by the Indus River. The problem of growing waterlogging and associated salinity in the interfluvial areas of the Indus basin is also of great concern. Although various water management agencies in Pakistan have done extensive studies on the hydrological problems of the Indus basin using classical techniques, the applications of environmental isotope techniques have yielded more accurate results regarding the ground water recharge mechanism, causes of waterlogging, the origin of salinity, and farm irrigation practice for remedial measures against waterlogging. The isotopic mapping of Indus River and the associated surface water and ground water reservoirs at various points along its course are discussed in the context of remedial measures.																					0-19-577905-3				1999							198	209																WOS:000231975600018

Late Neogene-Quaternary tephrochronology, stratigraphy, and paleoclimate of Death Valley, California, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Sedimentary deposits in midlatitude continental basins often preserve a paleoclimate record complementary to marine-based records. However, deriving that paleoclimate record depends on having well-exposed deposits and establishing a sufficiently robust geochronology. After decades of research, we have been able to correlate 77 tephra beds exposed in multiple stratigraphic sections in the Death Valley area, California, United States. These correlations identify 25 different tephra beds that erupted from at least five different volcanic centers from older than 3.58 Ma to ca. 32 ka. We have informally named and determined the ages for seven previously unrecognized beds: ca. 3.54 Ma tuff of Curry canyon, ca. 3.45 Ma tuff of Furnace Creek, ca. 3.1 Ma tuff of Kit Fox Hills, ca. 3.1 Ma tuff of Mesquite Flat, ca. 3.15 Ma tuff of Texas Spring, 3.117 +/- 0.011 Ma tuff of Echo Canyon, and the ca. 1.3 Ma Amargosa ash bed. Several of these tephra beds are found as far northeast as central Utah and could be important marker beds in western North America. Our tephrochronologic data, combined with magnetic polarity data and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations, redefine Neogene sedimentary deposits exposed across 175 km(2) of the Death Valley area. The alluvial/lacustrine Furnace Creek Formation is a time-transgressive sedimentary sequence ranging from ca. 6.0 to 2.5 Ma in age. The ca. 2.5-1.7 Ma Funeral Formation is typically exposed as a proximal alluvial-fan facies overlying the Furnace Creek Formation. We have correlated deposits in the Kit Fox Hills, Salt Creek, Nova Basin, and southern Death Valley with the informally named ca. 1.3-0.5 Ma Mormon Point formation. In addition, our correlation of the late Pleistocene Wilson Creek ash bed 15 in the Lake Rogers deposits represents the first unambiguous sequences deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (marine isotope stage [MIS] 2) in Death Valley. Based on this new stratigraphic framework, we show that the Pliocene and Pleistocene climate in Death Valley is consistent with the well-established marine tropical/ subtropical record. Pluvial lakes in Death Valley and Searles Valley began to form ca. 3.5-3.4 Ma in the late Pliocene during MIS MG5. Initiation of lakes in these two hydrologically separated valleys at the same time at the beginning of a cooling trend in the marine climate record suggests a link to a cooler, wetter (glacial) regional climate in North America. The Death Valley lake persisted until ca. 3.30 Ma, at the peak of the M2 glaciation, after which there is no evidence of Pliocene lacustrine deposition, even at the peak of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (ca. 2.75 Ma). If pluvial lakes in the Pliocene are an indirect record of glacial climate conditions, as they are for the Pleistocene, then a glacial climate was present in western North America for similar to 200,000 yr during the Pliocene, encompassing MIS MG5-M2. Pleistocene pluvial lakes in Death Valley that formed ca. 1.98-1.78 Ma, 1.3-1.0 Ma, and ca. 0.6 Ma (MIS 16) are consistent with other regional climate records that indicate a regional glacial climate; however, Death Valley was relatively dry at ca. 0.77 Ma (MIS 19), when large lakes existed in other basins. The limited extent of the MIS 2 marsh/shallow lake in the Lake Rogers basin of northern Death Valley reflects the well-known regional glacial climate at that time; however, Death Valley received relatively lower inflow and rainfall in comparison.

J	Bruhn, CHL				Bruhn, CHL			Reservoir architecture of deep-lacustrine sandstones from the Early Cretaceous Reconcavo rift basin, Brazil	AAPG BULLETIN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS												Synrift, lacustrine sedimentation took place along the entire eastern Brazilian margin in response to the Neocomian breakup of Gondwana. In the Reconcavo basin, a deep lake was developed and filled mainly by a thick (>2000 m) succession of dark-colored, organic-rich mudstones and sandstones, and by subordinate, oncolite- and ostracod-rich carbonates. In the Fazenda Balsamo oil field, near the northeastern border fault margin of Reconcavo basin, deep-lacustrine reservoirs comprise a succession up to 424 m thick composed mainly of laminated Glower section) and massive (upper section), medium- to fine-grained sandstones. Their porosities and permeabilities typically range from 14 to 23%, and 100 to 500 iud, respectively. The sandy reservoirs and interbedded source-rock mudstones comprise eight transgressive successions (mostly 20-120 m thick) bounded by basin-wide, mudstone marker beds. The average duration (about 83,000 yr) of each succession suggests that climatically driven lake level fluctuations may have modulated the cycle, deep-lacustrine sedimentation in the study area; however, the interaction of changes in lake level with tectonic activity defined the dominant type of reservoir facies and the geometry and position of sand bodies. Laminated sandstones form sandstone bodies that are 600-1200 m wide, 1.5-4.5 km long, and up to 46 m thick, which fill northeast-oriented, fault-bounded troughs. These rocks probably were deposited by long-duration, sand-rich density underflows preferentially developed during rising lake level or highstands. These rocks may reflect an increasingly humid climate and more powerful and sediment-loaded influent streams. The more intense fault activity during the deposition of the lower reservoir section would have axially focused density underflows coming from the northeastern end of the basin. Massive sandstones comprise turbidite channel-fills that are 100-800 m wide, more than 2 km long, and up to 38 m thick. Fault activity diminished during the deposition of the upper reservoir section, allowing the cutting and filling of northwest-oriented channels by turbidity currents derived from the nearby border fault margin, preferentially during falling lake level or lowstands. Despite the local erosion associated with some turbidite channels, no unconformity or widespread erosion surface can be recognized within the studied succession. The relatively rapid and continuous tectonic subsidence along the eastern border fault margin of the Reconcavo basin provided virtually unlimited accommodation space for the aggradational stacking of climatically controlled, deepening-upward successions.																			0149-1423					SEP	1999	83	9					1502	1525																WOS:000082537100007

This study focuses on Dawangtan Reservoir, a major drinking water source located in Guangxi, southern China, within the subtropical climate zone. The distribution, ecological risks, and potential sources of 10 HMs were systematically evaluated by integrating long-term water quality data, large-scale sediment surveys, and multiple environmental indices/methods. Results revealed that Fe and Mn concentrations in the water column reached 2.61 mg/L and 0.89 mg/L, respectively, with exceedances primarily occurring in the lacustrine zone due to anoxic sediment release during winter mixing. In contrast, Cd, Pb, and Hg were primarily associated with anthropogenic inputs, with maximum concentrations of 6.00 mu g/L (Cd), 19.00 mu g/L (Pb), and 0.17 mu g/L (Hg). In sediments, the reservoir's natural longitudinal gradient led to increasing Fe, Mn, and Pb concentrations from the riverine to the lacustrine zones. However, the average Hg concentration (0.17 mg/kg) was highest in the transition zone, and Cd showed marked spatial variability across all three zones. Comprehensive risk assessments identified Fe, Cd, Mn, and Hg as the primary contributors to sediment contamination, and suggested that the tributary adjacent to the industrial discharge exhibited the highest pollution levels and ecotoxicological risks. Principal component-based factor analysis attributed most HMs pollution (>52.2 %) to anthropogenic activities, particularly industrial discharges and agricultural inputs. The positive matrix factorization model further revealed that Hg was the predominant HMs associated with industrial wastewater, Cd was linked to the intensive use of agricultural chemicals, and Pb contamination stemmed from both forestry chemical applications and industrial emissions. These findings provide insights into mitigating global HMs contamination in drinking water reservoirs, emphasizing the importance of upgrading industrial wastewater treatment, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and optimizing reservoir operations to support drinking water resource management.

The impacts of future climate warming on alpine ecosystems are of particular concern, given that warming is expected to be most pronounced at high elevations around the globe. Here, we evaluate the limnological and ecological sensitivity of high-elevation lakes in the Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda-D. R. Congo) to climate change. This is done by comparing the species assemblages of larval chironomid remains deposited recently in lake sediments with those deposited at the base of short cores (dated to within or shortly after the Little Ice Age) in 16 lakes. Chironomid-based reconstructions of mean annual air temperature (MATemp) are made using a variety of inference models (with transfer functions based on weighted averaging, weighted-averaging partial least squares, and a weighted modern analogue technique), and two different calibration data sets, one covering the full regional temperature gradient and one comprising only high-elevation Rwenzori lakes and ponds. The reconstructed historical temperature change ranges between a cooling of -2.03A degrees C and a warming of +3.22A degrees C (with n = 16 lakes x 3 models x 2 calibration data sets). However, excluding the atypical mid-elevation lake Mahoma (2,990 m altitude), we find a three-to-one ratio of cases of inferred warming against inferred cooling, and of the 24 Delta MATemp values exceeding 0.60A degrees C, 23 are positive and only one is negative. Chironomid-inferred temperature changes mostly fall within the error range of the regional temperature inference models. A generalized linear mixed model analysis of the combined result from all lakes (except Mahoma) nevertheless indicates significantly warmer MATemp (on average +0.38 +/- A 0.11A degrees C) at present compared to between similar to 85 and similar to 645 years ago. Inferred temperature changes are independent of whether lakes are located in glaciated or non-glaciated catchments, and of the age of the core base, suggesting that at least part of the signal is due to relatively recent, anthropogenic warming. The direction of faunal change at the lakes in relation to established species-environment relationships suggests that part of the observed shifts in species composition reflect lake-specific evolution in habitat features other than temperature, such as nutrients, pH or oxygen regime, which in our present calibration data set co-vary with temperature to a greater or lesser extent. The fairly uniform and marked historical warming trend in Rwenzori lakes documented by this study highlights their ecological vulnerability and their value as early warning systems for detecting the limnological and ecological effects of global warming.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Lens, Luc/0000-0002-0241-2215; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2010	648	1					123	142		10.1007/s10750-010-0140-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0140-z													WOS:000277284000010

However, the volcanic activities have influenced alkaline lacustrine environment to a large extent. Therefore, the characteristics and distributions of alkaline-volcanic lithofacies remain unclear. The cores, thin sections, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and wireline logs are employed to conduct research on the type, characteristics, distribution and evolution model of lithofacies in Fengcheng Formation. The results indicate that seven lithofacies are developed, including basalt, tuff aceous conglomerate/sandstone, massive/laminated/alkaline tuffaceous fine-grained sedimentary rocks, and alkaline rocks. Among them, basalt is mainly developed in lower part. The massive/laminated/alkaline tuffaceous fine-grained sedimentary rocks are mainly developed in middle part. The tuff aceous conglomerate/sandstone and alkaline rocks are mainly developed in upper part. The wireline responses of diff erent lithofacies/sub-lithofacies vary significantly in stacking patterns and value scope. However, the lithofacies/sub-lithofacies with similar genesis share similarity in wireline responses. The lithofacies/sub-lithofacies distribution generally show progradation in the northwest and retrogradation in the southwest. The lithofacies/sub-lithofacies scope of fine-grained sedimentary rocks are to a large extent related to tuff aceous conglomerate/sandstone distribution. In addition, the lithofacies/sublithofacies are influenced by paleo-environment (paleo-salinity, paleo-climate, paleo-water depth) changes and volcanic activities. The climate in early depositional period has turned into dry and hot. Subsequently, the scope of lacustrine basin starts to shrink, resulting in gradually-increasing salinity. The lithology during this period is dominated by dolomite and dolomitic rocks. However, the climate in late depositional period remains dry and hot. The lake level continues to fall and the salinity continues to increase. The alkaline minerals such as alkali are precipitated, marking the final formation of alkaline lakes and alkaline rocks..																			1672-7975	1993-0658				2025 MAY 27	2025										10.1007/s11770-025-1201-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11770-025-1201-4		MAY 2025											WOS:001497132200001

In this study, ArcGIS is integrated with SWMM to develop a hydraulic model of the urban river network in Pingyu County, Zhumadian City, Henan Province. The model is used to analyze changes in the river system before and after the implementation of the water system connectivity project. Following the completion of the project, the number of rivers increased from 12 to 19, and the number of lakes grew from 4 to 8. The number of tributaries rose from 6 to 13, with the number of secondary tributaries increasing from 0 to 7. Analysis of a representative cross-section of the secondary drainage channel revealed that the peak flow and flow velocity at return periods of 10 and 20 years were delayed and reduced after the project. The concentrations of all monitored pollutants in the four primary rivers exhibited a decreasing trend. Specifically, the concentration of C6H5OH decreased by 95.77% to 93.33%, while the concentrations of TN (Total Nitrogen) and TP (Total Phosphorus) declined by 40-25% and 56-34.48%, respectively. The NH3-H concentration decreased by 45.83-40%, TSS (Total Suspended Solids) concentrations fell by 56-16.67%, and the reduction in COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) ranged from 64 to 20.94%. Additionally, the river network density increased from 0.43 to 0.63 km/km2, the water surface area ratio grew from 0.95 to 2.26%, and the river frequency rose from 0.19 to 0.28 line/km2. The development coefficient of the first-order tributary river network increased from 4.27 to 4.68 (a 9.51% increase), while the coefficient for secondary rivers rose from 0 to 2.22. Both the area-to-length ratio and average branching ratio remained largely unchanged.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				JUN	2025	121	11					12863	12885		10.1007/s11069-025-07299-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-025-07299-9		MAY 2025											WOS:001489039100001
J	Gonzales, GF; Villena, A; Aparicio, R				Gonzales, GF; Villena, A; Aparicio, R			Acute mountain sickness: Is there a lag period before symptoms?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY												The present study was designed to determine if symptoms of acute mountain sickness are presented within six hours after arrival at high altitude. Seventeen male subjects, 23-30 years, were studied. The subjects were professional soccer players, life-long residents at low altitudes except one player who was playing soccer in a team at 3400 m (512 mm Hg of Barometric Pressure) during an entire year in 1995. The players were transported by a commercial airline from Lima (150 m) to Cusco (3400 m). The trip lasted 1 hour. Heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were measured at rest in Lima (150 m), at the time of arrival at Cusco, and at 4 and 6 hours after arrival at 3400 m. On day 6 at high altitude, the physical performance during a soccer game was assessed. The symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) were assessed 6 hours after arrival at Cusco with a self-administered questionnaire, and thereafter each 24-hours up to 5 days of exposure to high altitude. The following symptoms were assessed: headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. AMS was defined by a Lake-Louise score greater than or equal to 4 (self-assessment only). Thirty five percent of the soccer players developed AMS within 6 hours after arrival by air at 3400 m altitude. Arterial oxygen saturation at arrival was higher in those player who developed AMS within 6 hours after arrival (94.3 +/- 0.94% vs 90.8 +/- 2.36; P < 0.001). From arrival to 6 hours of exposure to altitude, there was a significant fall in arterial oxygen saturation in those men who developed AMS than in those who did not. Results from the stepwise multiple regression (R-2 = 0.59; P < 0.04) and logistic regression (R-2 = 0.48; P < 0.0019) analyses showed that the difference between arterial oxygen saturation at sea level and at arrival at Cusco was a predictor for the development of AMS within 6 hours upon arrival at altitude. This suggests that the lower the difference between arterial oxygen saturation at sea level and at arrival, the higher the probability to develop AMS within 6 hours after arrival at 3400 m. The presentation of AMS, however, does not predict low performance in physical activity at high altitude. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Bryan, SE; Marti, J; Cas, RAF				Bryan, SE; Marti, J; Cas, RAF			Stratigraphy of the Bandas del Sur Formation: an extracaldera record of Quaternary phonolitic explosive eruptions from the Las Canadas edifice, Tenerife (Canary Islands)	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												Explosive volcanism has dominated the large phonolitic shield volcano of Tenerife, the Las Canadas edifice, for the last 1.5 m.y. Pyroclastic deposits of the Pandas del Sur Formation are exposed along the southern flanks, and record the last two of at least three long-term cycles of caldera-forming explosive eruptions. Each cycle began with flank fissure eruptions of alkali basalt lava, followed by minor eruptions of basanite to phonotephrite lavas. Minor phonotephritic to phonolitic lava effusions also occurred on the flanks of the edifice during the latter stages of the second explosive cycle. Nonwelded plinian fall deposits and ignimbrites are the dominant explosive products preserved on the southern flanks. Of these, a significant volume has been dispersed offshore. Many pyroclastic units of the second explosive cycle exhibit compositional zonation. Banded pumice occurs in most units of the third (youngest) explosive cycle, and ignimbrites typically contain mixed phenocryst assemblages, indicating the role of magma mixing/mingling prior to eruption. At least four major eruptions of the third cycle began with phreatomagmatic activity, producing lithic-poor, accretionary lapilli-bearing fallout and/or surge deposits. The repeated, brief phase of phreatomagmatism at the onset of these eruptions is interpreted as reflecting an exhaustive water supply, probably a small caldera lake that was periodically established during the third cycle. Accidental syenite becomes an increasingly important lithic clast type in ignimbrites up-sequence, and is interpreted as recording the progressive development of a plutonic complex beneath the summit caldera. Successive eruptions during each explosive cycle increased in volume, with the largest eruption occurring at the end of the cycle. More than ten major explosive eruptions vented moderately large volumes (1-greater than or equal to 10 km(3)) of phonolitic magma during the last two cycles. Culminating each explosive cycle was the emplacement of relatively large volume (> 5-10 km(3)) ignimbrites with coarse, vent-derived lithic breccias, interpreted to record a major phase of caldera collapse. In the extracaldera record, explosive cycles are separated by similar to 0.2 m.y. periods of non-explosive activity. Repose periods were characterized by erosion, remobilization of pyroclastic deposits by discharge events, and pedogenesis. The current period of non-explosive activity is characterized by the construction of the Teide-Pico Viejo stratovolcanic complex within the summit caldera. This suggests that eruptive hiatuses in the extracaldera record may reflect effusive activity and stratovolcano or shield-building phases within the summit caldera. Alternating effusive and explosive cycles have thus been important in the volcanic evolution of the Las Canadas edifice.

While most of the migratory subspecies have been tracked with geolocators, information is lacking for Siberian Barn Swallows H. r. tytleri. Based on one geolocator-tracked individual breeding at Lake Baikal, Russia, and complemented with ring-recovery data, we show that Siberian Barn Swallows migrate east of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau towards wintering grounds in mainland South-east Asia. This migration route distinguishes them from other tracked Asian Barn Swallow populations, which either migrate (south)westward to Africa or India or southward to South-east Asian islands. Notably, the geolocator-tracked Siberian Barn Swallow employed a direct route, likely traversing high mountain ranges during migration, without the detour through eastern China observed in other songbirds migrating from northern to south-eastern Asia. We propose that the Barn Swallow's efficient flight capabilities enable it to overcome geographical barriers that impede other landbirds.

These sections expose remarkable outcrops of Junggar foreland basin sediments that have been previously dated by high-resolution magnetostratigraphy to between similar to 23.6 and similar to 1 Ma, and similar to 10.5 and similar to 3.1 Ma. A total of 216 samples of fluvio-lacustrine sediments were collected from which isotopic analyses yield delta O-18 (SMOW) values that range from 13.7 parts per thousand to 29.9 parts per thousand in the Jingou He section, and 16.3 parts per thousand to 21.0 parts per thousand in the Kuitun He section. delta C-13 (PDB) values range from -12.9 parts per thousand to 3.0 parts per thousand in the Jingou He section and from -7.8 parts per thousand to -4.0 parts per thousand in the Kuitun He section. delta O-18 values decrease between similar to 25 and 23 Ma, and then remain relatively steady, with the exception of one period that contains samples with higher oxygen isotope values at similar to 16 Ma. During the periods when there are samples that overlap in time from the Kuitun He and Jingou He sections, we observe a difference of similar to 1.7% between values from the two locales. The delta C-13 values also decrease between similar to 25 and 23 Ma, and then remain relatively steady until similar to 10 Ma with, again, one short period of higher values at similar to 16 Ma. Then, between similar to 10 and 3.1 Ma, carbon isotope values progressively increase. We interpret that delta O-18 and delta C-13 isotopic values during lacustrine periods (similar to 25-23 Ma and similar to 16 Ma) as largely controlled by evaporation and opening/closing of the lake to external inputs. We interpret the delta O-18 values of paleosol carbonate in the Junggar Basin to be influenced by the hypsometry of the high Tianshan range while the delta C-18 values may record the uplift history of the depositional area in the foreland basin itself as well as the isotopic composition of plants. Consequently, we conclude that the Jingou He and Kuitun He drainage basins in the Central Tianshan have remained at relatively unchanged elevations for the past similar to 20 Ma. We also suggest that the elevation of the southern part of the foreland basin increased between similar to 10 and similar to 3.1 Ma, probably as a result of tectonic deformation in the piedmont and sedimentary filling of the sedimentary basin. The carbon isotope record remains relatively stable through time, and isotopic values suggest that there was little or no expansion of C4 plants in this region in the late Miocene.

The distribution pattern and the variation in relative abundance of recognized diatoms differentiated each core section into characteristic zones. These zones are interrupted by periods of poor preservation or non-diatom deposition that coincide with fluctuating lake phases of freshwater flooding of the Nile during humid warm episodes and arid phases associated with a reduction in the Nile's water influx that provides Lake Mariout with fresh water. A rising water level of Lake Mariout is estimated from the great abundance of riverine, planktonic Aulacoseira species. A lowering of water level was linked to a high abundance of brackish water taxa and/or periods of non-diatom deposition. Furthermore, the absence of diatoms at two intervals in Core 1 is associated with silty clay with an abundance of gypsum crystals which point to falling water lake levels with increasing temperature during dry periods. However, the intervals of poor preservation or no diatoms in other cores at 'Marea'/Philoxenite are presumably related to the coarser nature of the sediment that indicate a major lake level lowstand, a high-energy depositional environment together with increased salinity and alkalinity. By comparing the diatom data in the examined cores, it is clear that the Aulacoseira granulata assemblage zone is characteristic of the Roman and Byzantine periods, which reflects relatively rising water levels due to Nile water inflow via the Canopic Nile branch and thus the connection between the canal and lake during this time. Furthermore, the predominance of Aulacoseira granulata with some pollution-tolerant taxa indicates extensive human occupation during the Roman-Byzantine periods, which is evidenced by increased nutrient concentration with higher input of humic substances due to human activities and their influence on the lake ecosystem.					; Gwiazda, Mariusz/AAL-9691-2020; Zalat, Abdelfattah/AIB-3384-2022	Gwiazda, Mariusz/0000-0002-9984-9375; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				FEB	2025	40	2					287	302		10.1002/jqs.3686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3686													WOS:001416731200003

With above-average warming rates (0.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C per decade), the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is witnessing significant glacier mass loss, reduced snow cover, and increased permafrost thawing, all of which increase meltwater availability, leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes. Glacial lakes, in turn, further accelerate glacier mass loss through calving and subaqueous melt, creating a vicious feedback loop of glacial melting and expansion of glacial lakes. Lake with larger areas has a higher probability of interception of mass movements. Additionally, it exerts greater hydrostatic pressure on moraine dams and therefore higher magnitude of GLOF which can be extremely destructive, arriving unnoticed and destroying property, infrastructure, and agricultural land, often resulting in extensive loss of life and property. Sikkim Himalayas hosts a large number of glacial lakes and has received considerable scientific attention due to the potential GLOF hazards. This study focuses on 13 vulnerable glacial lakes (VGLs) in the Sikkim Himalayas, analysing their decadal dynamics from 1962 to 2020 using declassified Corona and Hexagon KH-9 imagery and Landsat satellite data. Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the total area of the VGLs, expanding from 3.594 km(2) in 1962 to 8.664 km(2) in 2020. However, individual lakes exhibited highly variable dynamics and growth histories, falling into either of the two categories, quasi-stable and dynamic lakes. Most VGLs were quasi-stable, with minimal growth over a decade, while dynamic lakes, connected to parent glaciers, showed continuous growth. Based on modelled future lake expansion, South Lhonak and KhangchungTsho were found to have future expansion potential of 0.472 km(2) and 0.333 km(2), respectively. With growing infrastructure and population downstream, the risk of future GLOF events is exceptionally high. Understanding glacial lake expansion is crucial for effective risk assessment and policy development in these vulnerable areas.

Sakurajima-Satsuma (Sz-S) and Noike-Yumugi (N-Ym) tephras: New tephrochronological marker beds for the last deglaciation, southern Kyushu, Japan	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Two prominent tephras, Sakurajima-Satsuma (Sz-S) erupted from Sakurajima volcano and Noike-Yumugi (N-Ym) erupted from Kuchierabujima Island, provide new key marker beds for dating and synchronizing palaeoenvironmental and archaeological records in the last deglaciation in southern Japan. These tephras were identified on the basis of glass major-element compositions in two distal areas, a marine core (IMAGES MD982195) in the northern part of the East China Sea and on the central part of Tanegashima Island, and we related their stratigraphic positions to the marine oxygen isotope-based chronology. In MD982195, Sz-S, 0.8 cm in thickness at 9.12 m depth and N-Ym, 3 cm in thickness at 9.30 m depth, are both white, vitric, ash-grade tephras. On Tanegashima Island, Sz-S, 10 cm in thickness and N-Ym, 3 cm in thickness, are stratigraphically constrained by well-characterised marker tephras Kikai-Akahoya (7300 cal BP) and Aira-Tn (29,000 cal BP). Sz-S is rhyolitic and homogeneous on the basis of glass major-element compositions assayed by electron microprobe. Pumiceous glass shards predominant in distal Sz-S tephra indicate that it derived from pumice fall units that correspond to pumiceous and phreatomagmatic fine ash units constituting proximal Sz-S tephra. N-Ym is rhyolitic and glass major-element analyses reveal compositional diversity between units, suggesting that the lower and middle tephra units dispersed to the east, whereas the upper unit was dispersed north to northwest from the vent. Stratigraphically, Sz-S occurs at around the start of the late-glacial reversal (cooling) in oxygen isotope records of MD982195, corresponding to the end of GI-1 and the start of GS-1 in the ice-core events of NGRIP (GICC05), consistent with a terrestrial age of similar to 12,800 cal BP. Based on the oxygen isotope stratigraphy, the tephra identified in the core as N-Ym at 9.30 m depth is close to the end of Greenland GI-1 and hence has an age of similar to 13,000 cal BP, but on Kuchierabujima Island it has an age based on C-14 assay of charcoal of c. 14,900 cal BR Although this age discrepancy (14.9 vs 13.0 cal ka) needs resolution, the occurrence in core MD982195 of N-Ym shows that it is more widespread than hitherto demonstrated. The widespread distributions and key stratigraphic positions for the two marker tephras indicate that they are thus critical isochrons for precise correlation of palaeoenvironmental changes and prehistoric cultural events during the last deglaciation in southern Kyushu, and for relating such changes and events to the ice-core chronology via the marine oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy.

C	Smolnicki, PM		Brandeis, A		Smolnicki, Piotr Marek			Potentials of water usage in urban neighbourhood structures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ISOCARP CONGRESS: URBAN TRANSFORMATIONS: CITIES AND WATER					50th ISOCARP Congress	SEP 23-26, 2014	Gdynia, POLAND	ISOCARP				This paper will treat about water influence and possibility of its usage in the urban neighborhood structures (e.g. districts, real estate properties, town parts) in the context of actual regional environmental problems and according to directories determined by European targets. It is not rare yet in the basic stage of urban design that water is treated as a threat, not a chance. In result planned structures are often built, for example, on hills on the one hand escaping from water but in reality creating new water-related problems (e.g. "the end of the stream/ channel/ pipe" problem). Hardening of the permeable top soil, wetlands drainage, channeling streams and even rivers, building concrete reservoirs without public entrance everything a (never ending) combat with the element. However, since the down of history, still until now, many communities around the world have been living without any conflict with surrounding water - treating it as a gift of nature. Wetlands, rivers, lakes characterize of biodiversity, both: fauna and flora. It is one the reasons of using it as a natural resource and development direction in improving the city quality of life. But there are many more contemporary possibilities of its usage: waterside offers to surrounding residents recreation places and sport activities (even some winter sports); aquatic organisms are used for water treatment and its plants for energy produce (algae panels or biomass combustion); research reinvented aquaponics as a harvesting and breeding which could be massively use in urban food production (it helps harvesting without need of top soil what is necessary to maintain wastelands, rooftops etc.); elevation differences of the terrain helps not only in energy produce but also in its kinetic storage and trading (depending on net energy price) for local use. The paper will scrutinize contemporary worldwide cases in modem (re)inventions of water usage in the urban neighborhood structures such as: aquaponics, micro-hydro-power plants, bio-water-treatment or algae energy produce. Above examples fit in local problems, especially in lack of drinkable water or flood risk. As a result author will show the possibilities of combining multiple cases from different points of view: neighborhood autonomy, safety and flood prevention, energy diversification.

J	Humphries, P				Humphries, P			Aquatic macrophytes, macroinvertebrate associations and water levels in a lowland Tasmanian river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Aquatic macrophytes are a common habitat for macroinvertebrates and may occupy depth zones in the littoral region of lowland rivers. Studies have indicated that different species of macrophyte typically support different assemblages, abundances and numbers of species of macroinvertebrates. This has often been attributed to differences in the dissectedness of stems and leaves of the macrophytes, resulting in differences in the surface area and/or the number of microhabitats available to invertebrates. I set out to measure the abundance and taxonomic richness and to describe the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with three species of aquatic macrophyte in a pool in the Macquarie River, Tasmania and to examine responses of these variables to changes in water levels over summer. The macrophyte species sampled were Myriophyllum simulans/variifolium, Triglochin procera and Eleocharis sphacelata, each one differing in the dissectedness of its stems and leaves and its location in the littoral zone. Whereas the greatest abundance of macroinvertebrates was found associated in all months (i.e. at all water levels) with the structurally complex and shallowest macrophyte species, Myriophyllum, the number of taxa associated with this species was in several cases lower than for the structurally simpler and deeper water Triglochin and EIeocharis. While water depth and total plant biomass of samples were often correlated with invertebrate abundance and richness, these relationships were different for each macrophyte species. Of the nine most common invertebrate taxa collected from all samples, the abundances of more than half showed consistent differences among macrophyte species across months, two showed differences among macrophytes, but with an interaction with month and two showed no differences among macrophytes. There were major differences in the invertebrate assemblages associated with each macrophyte species in any one month, however, there was also a large turnover of taxa associated with the species of macrophytes from one month to the next. Changes in water level and concomitant changes in environmental variables are suggested as factors influencing the invertebrate fauna in the littoral zone of the pool of the Macquarie River. It is thus important for river managers to be aware that species of macroinvertebrates are not evenly distributed across species of macrophyte and that water levels and their influence on macrophytes as invertebrate habitat may play an integral part in determining the abundance, richness and assemblage of invertebrates in rivers.

This region merges with the Caucasus Mountains in the east and is separated from the Central Black Sea region by the Melet River. The eastern part of the Melet River comprises the Colchic flora regions defined within the Euxine Sea region. This region is located in the Eastern Black Sea coastal mountains and defined as an Important Plant Area because of its floristic richness and high levels of endemism; it also provides a habitat for plants with high economic value. The humid forests in the vicinity of Uzungol are dominated by broad-leaved trees [such as eastern beech (Fagus orientalis), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), alder (Alnus glutinosa subsp. barbata), Anatolian chestnut (Cestanea sativa), elm (Ulmus glabra), maples (Acer trautvetteri and A. cappadocicum), and aspen (Populus tremula)] in elevated regions of 800-1000 m; these trees are mostly deciduous in winter. As the elevation increases, these trees are replaced by evergreen coniferous forests, which predominantly comprise oriental spruce (Picea orientalis) and Eastern Black Sea fir (Abies nordmanniana subsp. nordmanniana). Finally, the upper limit of forest elevation varies between 2200 and 2250 m. In such elevated regions, birch species (Betula litwinowii and B. pendula) form pure communities in some areas. Woody species such as Rhododendron are specific to the Colchic flora region and extend to the alpine region. Some aquatic plant species such as water horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile), cattail (Typha shuttleworthii), soft rush (Juncus effusus), purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and simplestem bur-reed (Sparganium erectum subsp. neglectum) have been identified in regions located in the vicinity of Uzungol. Increasing numbers of tourism-related buildings have been constructed around the Uzungol lake since the 1980s, and an increase in the number of tourists has also conferred great pressure on the natural vegetation. The most common invasive plant in the study region is oneseed bur-cucumber (Sicyos angulatus), which is native to eastern North America.

The Western Australian Museum meteorite collection	HISTORY OF METEORITICS AND KEY METEORITE COLLECTIONS: FIREBALLS, FALLS AND FINDS	Geological Society Special Publication											The first meteorites recovered from Western Australia were a number of irons, the earliest of which was found in 1884 east of the settlement of York. These were named the 'Youndegin' meteorites after a police outpost. Some of the larger specimens were taken to London to be sold as scrap metal, but were recognized as meteorites and eventually acquired by museums. The main mass of Youndegin (2626 kg) was recovered in 1954 and is retained in the collection of the Western Australian Museum. Despite a sparse population and relatively recent settlement by Europeans (1829), a number of factors have contributed to the excellent record of meteorite recovery in Western Australia. Primarily, large regions of arid land have allowed meteorites to be preserved for millennia, and these are generally easily distinguished from the country rocks. A less obvious, but significant, factor is that, in antiquity, Australian Aborigines do not appear to have utilized meteorites extensively. Finally, systematic collecting from the Nullarbor Region, has contributed to the large numbers of recoveries since 1969. The 'Father' of the State's meteorite collection was the chemist and mineralogist Edward Sydney Simpson (1875-1939) who, from 1897 to 1939, recorded and analysed many of the meteorites that formed the foundation of the collection. The first Catalogue of Western Australian Meteorites was published by McCall & de Laeter in 1965 (Western Australian Museum, Special Publications, 3). Forty-eight meteorites were listed, 29 of which were irons (some of which have since been paired). Interest in meteorites increased in the 1960s, so that when the second supplement to the catalogue was published in 1972, 92 meteorites were listed with stones accounting for most of the additional recoveries. Today, the collection contains thousands of specimens of 248 distinct meteorites from Westem Australia (218 stones, 26 irons and four stony-irons), and around 500 samples of potentially new meteorites (mostly chondrites from the Nullarbor) that remain to be examined. There are also specimens of 160 meteorites from other parts of Australia and the rest of the world. While numerically the collection is small compared to other major collections in the world, it contains a high percentage of main masses from Western Australia (around 85%), including many rarities, and has an aggregate weight in excess of 20 tonnes. The small proportion of falls to finds (4 : 244) reflects the sparse population of the State. This may change significantly when a network of all-sky fireball cameras is established in the Nullarbor Region.																			0305-8719		978-1-86239-194-9				2006	256						305	323		10.1144/GSL.SP.2006.256.01.15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/GSL.SP.2006.256.01.15													WOS:000269439800016
J	ERNST, RE; BUCHAN, KL				ERNST, RE; BUCHAN, KL			PALEOMAGNETISM OF THE ABITIBI DYKE SWARM, SOUTHERN SUPERIOR-PROVINCE, AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LOGAN LOOP	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The trace of the Middle Proterozoic Logan Loop of the North American apparent polar wander path is controversial. The older 1270 - 1110 Ma limb of the loop is poorly constrained, while the depth of the loop, based on the 1110 - 1080 Ma Keweenawan data of the younger limb, is thought by some to be largely an artifact of reversal asymmetry in the Earth's magnetic field. Paleomagnetism of the 1141 Ma Abitibi mafic dyke swarm is one of the keys to constraining the geometry of the Logan Loop. Unfortunately, previous paleomagnetic studies failed to distinguish dykes of the northeast-trending Middle Proterozoic olivine-bearing Abitibi swarm from subparallel Early Proterozoic olivine-free Biscotasing (formerly Preissac) dykes, and hence paleomagnetic poles determined in these studies should no longer be used. In the present study, sampling of eight Abitibi dykes has identified 23 normally magnetized sites in four dykes and, for the first time, five reversely magnetized sites in three dykes. One of the normally magnetized sites corresponds to the locality for which a high-precision U - Pb age was previously reported. A baked contact test establishes that the characteristic remanence of one normally magnetized dyke is primary. In addition, sites along individual dykes exhibit much smaller secular variation than is observed between dykes, indicating that the remanences of the other dykes are also primary. One of the normally magnetized dykes, the 700 km long Great Abitibi dyke, exhibits two primary directions that correspond to two geochemically distinct magma pulses. The five normally magnetized units, which consist of four separate dykes plus the second pulse of the Great Abitibi dyke, yield a well-defined mean paleomagnetic pole at 42.8-degrees-N, 151.5-degrees-W, dm = 16.3-degrees, dp = 12.5-degrees. It falls close to the reversely magnetized poles from the Keweenawan Track and establishes a minimum depth for the Logan Loop of about 40-degrees. The reversed-polarity data from three other dykes are more scattered and may not average out secular variation. Hence, the present study is inconclusive, regarding asymmetry of the Earth's magnetic field at 1141 Ma, even though a mean pole based on combined normal- and reversed-polarity dykes is indistinguishable from that based on normal-polarity dykes alone.

Chemical Composition of the Hydro-Cryogenic System of Lake Baikal: ?Snow on Ice-Ice-Water Under-Ice?	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The results of studies of the chemical composition and the basic regularities of migration of macro-and mi-croelements within the hydro-cryogenic system "snow on ice-ice-water under ice" obtained in the winter of 2016/17 in the waters of Lake Baikal are presented. Such investigation over the Lake area was carried out for the first time. It has been found that due to climatic conditions, dates of freeze-up (formation of the ice on the Lake) differ by 7-10 days from North to South, and the depth of snow on ice and its density change over the Lake area by 2 times, however there are some parts without snow. It was found that the changes in the pH indexes were identical across the whole Lake area - minimum pH values are present in the snow (from 5.59 to 7.39), average values - in the ice (6.01-7.50), and maximum values are noted in the water under ice (7.42-8.50). For the most part, increased quantities of suspended matter and an increase in the pH of snow were recorded near settlements, which is obviously a result of the anthropogenic influence. It was determined that the concentration of ions in the ice in relation to their content in the initial solutions decreases within the series: > Cl- > > NO2 - SO4 2 - HCO3- . Among the cations, K+, Na+ions are involved into the ice intensively, while the Ca2+ and Mg2+ - weakly. The ice phase is enriched with ammonium ions outside the settlements. Near settlements and in shallow water, quantity of salts in the ice may be close to or equal to their concentra-tion in the water under ice. The coefficient of migration in the water (Kx) divide the chemical elements into two groups - the mobile ones and slow-moving elements. The first group includes Ca, Cu, Sr, Mg, Co, Zn, and Cd (Kx >1), the second one contains Ba, Mn, Si, Fe, Al, Ti, Ni, Cr, P, and K.

J	Davidson, TA; Sayer, CD; Langdon, PG; Burgess, A; Jackson, M				Davidson, Thomas A.; Sayer, Carl D.; Langdon, Peter G.; Burgess, Amy; Jackson, Michael			Inferring past zooplanktivorous fish and macrophyte density in a shallow lake: application of a new regression tree model	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Eutrophication has a profound effect on the biological structure and function of shallow lakes, altering the composition and abundance of submerged macrophyte and fish assemblages. Relatively little is known, however, about decadal to centennial-scale change in these important aspects of shallow lake ecology. 2. Established palaeolimnological inference models are limited to reconstructing a single variable. As macrophyte and zooplanktivorous fish abundance exert dual and interacting controls on cladoceran assemblages a single variable inference model may contain significant error. To obviate this problem, we applied a new cladoceran-based multivariate regression tree (MRT) model to cladoceran subfossil assemblages from dated cores from a small shallow lake (Felbrigg Lake, U.K.) to assess long-term change in fish and submerged macrophyte abundance. Plant macrofossil, chironomid and mollusc subfossil assemblages were also analysed to track changes in biological structure and function and to evaluate the inferences of the MRT model. 3. Over the 200+ year period covered by the sediment cores, there was good agreement in the timing and nature of ecological change reflected by the plant macrofossil, mollusc, chironomid and cladoceran data. The sediment sequence was divided into three dated zones: c. 1797-1890, c. 1890-1954 and c. 1954-present. Prior to 1890 plant-associated mollusc, cladoceran and chironomid assemblages indicated a species-rich macrophyte community; a scenario confirmed by the plant macrofossil data. From c. 1890 to 1954 macrophyte-associated species of all three invertebrate groups remained abundant but the proportion of pelagic cladocerans rose. Post-1954 mollusc and chironomid assemblages changed to sediment associated detrital feeders and the proportion of pelagic cladoceran taxa increased further. 4. The cladoceran-based MRT model indicated a long period of stability, c. 1790-1927, characterised by abundant submerged macrophytes and zooplanktivorous fish. From c. 1927 to 1980, the MRT model inferred a decline in zooplanktivorous fish density (ZF) but relative stability in August macrophyte abundance. From 1980 to 2000, an increase in zooplanktivorous fish was inferred tallying well with available data on the fish population (since the 1970s), which indicated extirpation of perch in the 1970s and a subsequent increase in the rudd population. The model inferred little change in August macrophyte abundance until post-c. 1980 at which point it indicated a decline. The surface sediment assemblage was placed in MRT group A, where submerged plants are absent or very rare in late summer in good agreement with current conditions at the site. 5. The MRT model, applied here for the first time, appears to have successfully tracked changes in macrophyte abundance and ZF over the last 200 years at Felbrigg Lake. The inferences agreed with historical observations on the fish community and the supporting palaeolimnological data. Given that multiple structuring forces shape most biological communities, the application of a model capable of allowing for this represents a significant advance in palaeolimnology.

J	Giordano, G				Giordano, G			Facies characteristics and magma-water interaction of the White Trachytic Tuffs (Roccamonfina Volcano, Southern Italy)	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Quaternary White Trachytic Tuffs Formation from Roccamonfina Volcano (southern Italy) comprises four non-welded, trachytic, pyroclastic sequences bounded by paleosols, each of which corresponds to small- to intermediate-volume explosive eruptions from central vents. From oldest to youngest they are: White Trachytic Tuff (WTT) Cupa, WTT Aulpi, WTT S. Clemente, and WTT Galluccio. The WTT Galluccio eruption was the largest and emplaced similar to 4 km(3) of magma. The internal stratigraphy of all four WTT eruptive units is a complex association of fallout, surge, and pyroclastic flow deposits. Each eruptive unit is organized into two facies associations, Facies Association A below Facies Association B. The emplacement of the two facies associations may have been separated by short time breaks allowing for limited reworking and erosion. Facies Association A consists of interbedded fallout deposits, surge deposits, and subordinate ignimbrites. This facies association involved the eruption of the most evolved trachytic magma, and pumice clasts are white and well vesiculated. The grain size coarsens upward in Facies Association A, with upward increases of dune bedform wavelengths and a decrease in the proportion of fine ash. These trends could reflect an increase in eruption column height from the onset of the eruption and possibly also in mass eruption rate. Facies Association B comprises massive ignimbrites that are progressively richer in lithic clast content. This association involved the eruption of more mafic magma, and pumice clasts are gray and poorly vesiculated. Facies Association B is interpreted to record the climax of the eruption. Phreatomagmatic deposits occur at different stratigraphic levels in the four WTT and have different facies characteristics. The deposits reflect the style and degree of magma-water interaction and the local hydrogeology. Very fine-grained, lithic-poor phreatomagmatic surge deposits found at the base of WTT Cupa and WTT Galluccio could record the interaction of the erupting magma with a lake that occupied the Roccamonfina summit depression. Renewed magma-water interaction later in the WTT Galluccio eruption is indicated by fine grained, lithic-bearing phreatomagmatic fall and surge deposits occurring at the top of Facies Association A. They could be interpreted to reflect shifts of the magma fragmentation level to highly transmissive, regional aquifers located beneath the Roccamonfina edifice, possibly heralding a caldera collapse event.					; Giordano, Guido/ABC-4130-2021	GIORDANO, Guido/0000-0002-5819-443X; 													0258-8900	1432-0819				AUG	1998	60	1					10	26		10.1007/s004450050213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004450050213													WOS:000075312800002
J	Cohen, AS; Talbot, MR; Awramik, SM; Dettman, DL; Abell, P				Cohen, AS; Talbot, MR; Awramik, SM; Dettman, DL; Abell, P			Lake level and paleoenvironmental history of Lake Tanganyika, Africa, as inferred from late Holocene and modern stromatolites	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Fossil and living stromatolites are abundant around the margins of Lake Tanganyika, Africa, and provide a wealth of paleolimnologic and paleoclimatic information for the late Holocene. Six lines of evidence show that stromatolites and cements are precipitating in the lake today: (1) carbonate saturation state calculations, (2) documentation of living stromatolites and their depth distribution, (3) new stable isotope data showing the lake's present mixing state and ancient evaporation and inflow balance, (4) new radiocarbon data and a reevaluation of apparent C-14 ages derived from Lake Tanganyika carbonates, (5) the presence of modern Mg-calcite cements derived from lake waters, and (6) the presence of modern, biologically mediated Mg-calcite precipitates in the lake. Lake Tanganyika's lake levels have been remarkably stable over the past 2800 yr, fluctuating around the marginally open to marginally closed level through most of this time period, Lake lowstands and high delta(18)O values from the ninth century B.C. to the early fifth century A.D. indicate that the lake basin was comparatively dry during this time. However, the period prior to the most recent opening of Lake Kivu into the Lake Tanganyika basin (ca. A.D. 550) was not marked by major lake lowstands, nor was this opening accompanied by a dramatic lake-level rise. The Kivu opening was roughly coincident with a significant shift toward isotopically lighter (delta(18)O and delta(13)C) lake water, which persists today. The lake remained close to its outlet level between the sixth and thirteenth centuries A.D. Lake levels rose between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. At some time between the late sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries, lake level fell to perhaps its lowest level in the past 2800 yr. By the early nineteenth century, lake level had begun to rise to the overflow level, apparently the result of a regional increase in precipitation/evaporation ratios. Weak delta(18)O/delta(13)C covariance for late Holocene carbonates suggests that the surface elevation of the lake has remained near the outlet level, with only occasional periods of closure. However, there is no simple relationship between solute input from Lake Kivu, isotope input from Lake Kivu, and lake levels in Lake Tanganyika, Lake Kivu waters are the primary source of major ions in Lake Tanganyika, but are much less important in controlling the delta(18)O and the lake level of Lake Tanganyika. Because the Ruzizi River's discharge into Lake Tanganyika is largely derived from sources other than Lake Kivu, the overflow events in the two lakes have been uncoupled during the late Holocene.																			0016-7606					APR	1997	109	4					444	460		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0444:LLAPHO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<0444:LLAPHO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WU32100005
J	Cimbleris, ACP; Kalff, J				Cimbleris, ACP; Kalff, J			Volumetric and aerial rates of heterotrophic bacterial production in epi- and hypolimnia: the role of nutrients and system morphometry	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Epilimnetic and hypolimnetic bacterial production ( BP) were measured once in summer, by the incorporation of [H-3] - Leucine in each of 14 Quebec ( Canada) lakes varying in nutrient content and morphometry. The epilimnetic and hypolimnetic BP were evaluated at two scales: the common per unit volume and areal (m(-2)) scale. The per unit volume scale epilimnetic BP was best predicted by total phosphorus (TP, r(2) = 0.63), and by water residence time (WRT r(2) = 0.57), with WRT serving as a surrogate for the nutrient and organic matter supply from the catchments. Total phosphorus and lake mean depth (Z(m)) together explained 79% of the variation in epilimnetic BP (l(-1)). In contrast, hypolimnetic BP (l(-1)) was neither linked to nutrients (TP or TN) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but only to measures of lake morphometry and best of all to hypolimnetic thickness (Zh; r(2) = 0.74). With increased Zh, there is an increased dilution of settling organic particles and their nutrients, resulting in a decrease in BP per litre. Conversely, when BP is expressed in areal units (m(-2)), hypolimnetic production increases with increasing hypolimnetic thickness. Water column thickness is a master variable, which together with Chl a ( abundance of particles) determines hypolimnetic BP at the whole system scale even though the trophic status is the best single indicator of epilimnetic BP on a volumetric scale. Conclusions drawn invariably change with the scale of investigation. Moreover, it is clear that lake morphometry has a major impact on BP. A comparison of whole water column integrated BP with literature derived estimates of the equivalent sediment production (m(-2)) below suggests that if the estimated sediment rates are not complete technique artefacts, they are likely to be an order of magnitude higher than the water column rates (m(-2)) at the maximum depth sampling sites. The relative importance of the sediments could be expected to rise with a decline in the maximum depth of lakes, characterized by progressively thinner hypolimnia. The present findings point to both a primarily allocthonous fuelling of sediment production and an uncoupling of water and sediment BP.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2003	500	1-3					193	202		10.1023/A:1024609004974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024609004974													WOS:000184071400013
C	Webb, JW; Stout, SR			USSD	Webb, JW; Stout, SR			Spillway remediation of dams in Nicaragua damaged by Hurricane Mitch	REDUCING RISK FROM EXTREME EVENTS					23rd Annual United-States-Society-on-Dams Conference	APR 14-18, 2003	Charleston, SC	US Soc Dam, Duke Power, Santee Cooper, S Carolina Elect & Gas Co				The Mancotal Dam of the Apanas Reservoir in Nicaragua, among others was severely damaged during Hurricane Mitch. The Corps of Engineers was tasked with evaluation of appropriate remediation/stabilization measures at this and other sites. Nicaragua is dependent on five dam sites for water supply and most of the electric power generation capabilities in-country. The storm used to size a dam and spillway is called a "Design Storm"; a "Design Flood" is the flood resulting from this storm. The accepted design standard for any large significant dam is the Probable Maximum Storm (PMS). This is the largest magnitude, most critically intense rainfall-producing storm that can be reasonably assumed to occur over a region. The Probable Maximum Flood (PMF), which is the flood resulting from this storm, is typically more familiar in terminology. The annual exceedance probability associated with the PMF has always been highly controversial. The fact that Hurricane Mitch exceeded the PMS lends credibility to use of the design storm as a standard for design floods and reinforces the need to consider these extreme events in performing risk assessments. The storm resulting from Hurricane Mitch, which occurred in 1997 was used for this evaluation. A detailed evaluation of the Hurricane Mitch storm indicates many of the indices used in developing a PMS in the United States are exceeded by this storm. The "Transposed Mitch" rainfall distribution and intensity is different but approximates the total PMS rainfall amount. The relative size and magnitude of the Hurricane Mitch storm in comparison to a "worst storm possible" is important. It is also important to this study to know "how" and "where" the rain fell during Mitch relative to Lake Apanas. Many other factors such as orographic changes in landmass and distances from moisture sources also play a role in developing an appropriate design storm. The PMS and "Transposed Mitch" events were both considered in developing the final spillway design for Moncotal dam. Alternative designs for remediation/repair of the extensive damage to the spillways were developed and preliminary designs and estimates provided to the government of Nicaragua for implementation.																					1-884575-32-3				2003							373	382																WOS:000224177200031
J	Pizarro, H; Allende, L; Bonaventura, SM				Pizarro, H; Allende, L; Bonaventura, SM			Littoral epilithon of lentic water bodies at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula: biomass variables in relation to environmental conditions	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the structural characteristics of the littoral epilithon in nine lentic water bodies at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, during summer 2002. At each site we measured the main physical and chemical variables and took epilithic samples for the analysis of dry weigh, ash, ash-free dry weight and chlorophyll a concentration. Distance from the sea of each water body was also considered. One site was selected for sampling lakes and ponds, except for Boeckella lake, where two sampling sites ( A and B) were selected due to the heterogeneity of its littoral zone. Three stones for chlorophyll a analysis and another three to estimate dry weight, ash and ash-free dry weight, were taken randomly about 1 m away from the shore-line of each sampling site. Measurements of physical and chemical characteristics were obtained similarly. Water samples for chemical analysis were taken sub-superficially. Lakatos's system of classification and the Autotrophic Index were used to make functional inferences about the epilithic communities. Two PCA analyses were made to classify the water bodies according to environmental features and epilithic variables. In the latter, major patterns in data of epilithon were subsequently interpreted based on environmental data using external validation. Pingui pond, located in the middle of the penguin rookery, was considered as a passive sample in both PCA analyses due to its extreme characteristics. Limnological features of the studied water bodies were similar to those of other Maritime Antarctic lakes. According to the Lakatos's index, 60% of the sampled lakes had high epilithic mass and a same proportion showed an inorganic type of epilithon The fact that 40% of the water bodies were autotrophic confirmed the importance of benthos as primary producer. According to environmental features, the well-defined groups of lakes emerged from the PCA were mainly determined by distance from the sea, pH, conductivity and salinity, and corresponded to the principal hydrological basins found in the region. Based on the results of the second PCA, littoral epilithon was affected by nitrate concentration and conductivity. In this ordination, water bodies from the same hydrological basin were separated probably as a result of a very complex inter-play of factors with a site-specific response to particular microhabitat characteristics.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2004	529	1					237	250																WOS:000225042200020
J	RYTUBA, JJ				RYTUBA, JJ			EVOLUTION OF VOLCANIC AND TECTONIC FEATURES IN CALDERA SETTINGS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE LOCALIZATION OF ORE-DEPOSITS	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												Many calderas are located along regionally important fault zones that are intermittently active before and after the caldera cycle. In mineralized calderas, the ore deposits are controlled by structures developed during caldera formation and by regional faults which intersect and reactivate the caldera-related structures. In the earliest phase of the caldera cycle, tumescence occurs over the shallowly emplaced magma chamber and normal faults develop within the structural dome above the magma chamber. This early phase of faulting is disrupted by caldera formation but some of the faults are preserved outside the caldera margin and may become important ore-controlling structures such as the Ruja mercury deposit in the McDermitt caldera complex, Nevada, and the precious metal deposits in the Atlanta district, Nevada, outside the Indian Peak caldera. Caldera-related structures such as ring fracture faults are commonly the most important in controlling the emplacement of resurgent magma, as well as postcollapse intrusions and associated ore deposits. During the resurgence phase of the caldera, faults related to an apical graben, and radial and ring faults and fractures form and may extend outside the collapse structure. Radial and ring faults and fractures provided the structural control for gold alunite-type deposits in the Rodalquilar caldera complex, Spain. At the end of the caldera cycle, the area over the batholith related to the caldera-forming magma chambers is uplifted as isostatic compensation occurs, or subsides if the volcanic field is developed within a rapidly subsiding graben. Volume change resulting from crystallization will also contribute to subsidence. Regional subsidence of the Lake Owyhee volcanic field in southeastern Oregon at the end of the caldera cycle is reflected by arkosic sedimentation in the caldera basins and throughout the eastern part of the volcanic field. Crystallization of the underlying batholith permits the reestablishment of brittle deformation along the regional faults which initially may have controlled magma emplacement. This tectonic activity may reactivate caldera structures and these typically become important for localization of hydrothermal activity. Hot spring-type gold deposits in the Lake Owyhee volcanic field formed when a regional northwest-trending structure reactivated the caldera ring fracture fault zone of the Three Fingers caldera. The formation of hydrothermal ore deposits at the end of the caldera cycle is often related to tectonic reactivation of caldera structures by regional faults and emplacement of small volumes of magma as stocks and vent complexes along these structures.																			0361-0128					DEC	1994	89	8					1687	1696		10.2113/gsecongeo.89.8.1687	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.89.8.1687													WOS:A1994QK97300003
J	Harris, SA				Harris, Stuart A.			Climate change and permafrost stability in the eastern Canada Cordillera: The results of 33 years of measurements	SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS												Over the last 33 years, a network of climate stations has been set up at high altitude mountain permafrost sites from Plateau Mountain near Claresholm, Alberta, north to Sheldon Lake on the North Canol Road in the Yukon. Taken together with the data from the US National Weather Service and the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service, the results indicate a cooling of mean annual air temperature south of Calgary, no significant change in Calgary, a slight warming at Jasper, and a major warming at Summit Lake, west of Fort Nelson. In contrast, the south eastern and central Yukon show only a minor warming trend that lies well within the limits of a sixty-year record measured by the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service. Along the Mackenzie valley and on the North Slope of Alaska, the mean annual air temperature is rising. Permafrost is aggrading on Plateau Mountain, degrading at Summit Lake, and appears to be stable in southern Yukon and southern Alaska. This is in contrast to the warming occurring on the Arctic coastal plain and along the Mackenzie valley. It therefore appears that changes in climate vary considerably from place to place, and even where warming may occur, it may not continue indefinitely. There has been a northward shift of the arctic front due to a weakening of air pressure in the Yukon and Alaska relative to the continental tropical (cT) and maritime polar (mT) air masses to the south. Any actual changes that may be occurring appear to undergo amplification along the Mackenzie valley and Arctic coastal plain and reduction by buffering in the interior Yukon and Alaskan mountains, a result of micro-environmental factors. Continued, careful monitoring of the climate is required and needs to be expanded in the National Parks in the mountains in order to provide data on the changes that may be taking place. Such measurements can provide a sound basis for interpreting ecological and other climate-related data. The existing climate models are not working satisfactorily because we do not know enough about the causes and processes involved in climate change. Improved results can indicate where best to site structures such as pipelines so as to minimize maintenance costs. Models may also help explain why certain areas such as Beringia, which saw reduced climate change, acted as important refugia during the glaciations.																			1674-3822						2009	1	5					381	403																WOS:000422278400001

Assessment of Cereal Grain Waste Densities to Aid Waterfowl Conservation Planning in the Klamath Basin	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Postharvest waste seed from cereal grains is a major dietary component of waterfowl in the Klamath Basin in northeastern California and southeastern Oregon, a region that plays host to over a million waterfowl annually. Understanding food abundance is critical to local waterfowl management; therefore, we conducted a study in 2008 to investigate waste grain densities in barley, oat, and wheat fields. We used hierarchal mixed effect models to assess several factors that may affect waste grain densities postharvest. We also compared the effects of residue management practices to measure the effect of these treatments. To understand the scope of postharvest practices, we conducted a weekly road survey to document treatments applied to fields in our study area. We found that region best explained the variance of postharvest waste grain in barley fields, where the Tule Lake region had 89% greater densities than Lower Klamath. Neither harvester age nor baling affected waste grain in oats fields. In wheat fields, the model containing region and lodging ranked highest, where the Tule Lake region had 66% greater waste densities than Lower Klamath, and lodging increased waste grain by 70%. Burning did not reduce waste grain in barley or oat fields. Chisel-disking reduced waste grain by 94% in wheat fields compared with postharvest. Our field treatment survey found that 70% of barley fields were untreated while 18% were disked and 13% were burned and flooded. We estimated that 82% of oat fields were burned postharvest, while 18% were burned and flooded. In wheat, 61% of fields were left untreated, while 16% were disked, 8% were chisel-plowed, and 7% were flooded postharvest. Flooding and burning occurred primarily on National Wildlife Refuges, while disking, chisel-plowing, and postharvest irrigation occurred solely on private properties. Our results indicate that reducing tillage treatments would boost accessibility of cereal grain food resources to waterfowl in the Klamath Basin, and incentives to flood grain fields on private properties should be considered for the same purpose when and where possible.						casazza, Mike/0000-0002-5636-735X													1944-687X					JUN	2022	13	1					3	16		10.3996/JFWM-20-091	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-20-091													WOS:000815718000001

The abandoned quarry's walls extend upward over 50 m exposing the lower and upper diatreme facies. Petrographic analyses revealed two main compositionally distinct suites of intrusive and extrusive bodies: dikes, sills, and lava-lakes with relics of fine-grained basanite (to limburgite) and a set of rhonite-bearing picrobasalt dikes and sills. The parallel, almost linear, and relatively fractionated (La-N/Yb-N 21.98-26.21) chondrite-normalized REE patterns suggest the erupted magmas originated through low-degree partial melting and did not undergo any significant fractionation. Close relationships between basanites and picrobasalts is confirmed also with mineral chemistry with almost identical compositional trends of clinopyroxene and spinel-group phases. The negligible difference between bulk-rock Mg# (0.71-0.72 for basanites and 0.74 for picrobasalts) and melt Mg# calculated from olivine composition (0.70 for basanites and 0.68-0.70 for picrobasalts) reflects rather a load of mantle-derived (high Mg#) xenoliths and xenocrysts rather than the presence of cummulitic olivine. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility data reveals magnetic fabrics of variable orientations that reflect upward, downward, and sub-horizontal magma flow within the diatreme complex. Paleomagnetic data fall into three general groupings that we interpret to reflect magma emplacement during at least three phases. These data also support tilting, rotation, and slumping of diatreme host rocks causing physical displacement of the intrusions following remanence acquisition. Four new Ar-40/Ar-39 age determinations from the picrite (n = 1) and basinite (n = 3) yield relatively undisturbed age spectra that constrain the age of emplacement between 31.24 and 32.40 Ma, indicating that magmatic evolution of the Zakupy diatreme spanned 1.2 million years. This multidisciplinary study reveals that the Zakupy diatreme evolved from several similarly sourced magmatic pulses. Repeated molten fuel coolant interactions produced a complex diatreme setting consisting of multiple eruptive events leading to coherent intrusions, various pyroclastic and hyaloclastite materials, local contact metamorphism, and other evidence of explosive hot rock-fluid interactions. The complex evolution and eruptive behavior, together with a protracted time of the diatreme activity, illuminate that small, seemingly simple volcanoes experience a very dynamic evolution involving multiple intrusive events, changing eruptive styles, and surface morphologies.

Presence and Characterisation of Microplastics in Water from Sulur Lake, Tamil Nadu, India	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Microplastics (MPs) are one of the emerging contaminants nowadays in water, air, and soil. MPs have become an ecological threat to the freshwater ecosystem. The present study was conducted to determine the MP abundance in the surface and sediment samples collected from Sulur Lake from 10 different sites. Sulur is one of the significant urban areas in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India. The Sulur Lake is one of the most extensive perennial lakes and is the primary urban water source of the Sulur. The MP samples were collected from surface water and the sediments (n = 10) using the Van Veen grab sampling method. The samples were digested and isolated using the wet peroxide oxidation method followed by density separation. MPs were sorted visually and differentiated according to size, shape, colour, and polymer type. Among the 10 sites, the most abundant MPs were found in sediment samples (average: 84.6 +/- 5.01 items/kg) than in surface water (average: 73.2 +/- 0.41 items/5 L). The dominant colour, shape, and polymer found in the water samples were transparent and white; fibre; and HDPE, respectively in both sediments as well as surface waters. The major size of MPs found from samples falls in the two major categories of 0.5-1 mm size (349 items) in surface samples and 2-5 mm size (209 items) in sediments. The presence of MPs in Sulur Lake indicates that lakes are contaminated. This study provides insight into the types and abundance of MPs in Sulur Lake, displaying similar MP contamination that can be observed in waterbodies worldwide. Lakes when exposed to MPs, aquatic organisms like fish can also in turn be exposed to MPs. Fishes from Sulur Lake are one of the primary food sources for the local population of Coimbatore, which in turn can cause MP exposure to humans through fish consumption. This research is a baseline study for the proposed site of Sulur Lake for MP contamination, and further research on the MP exposure in the fish from Sulur Lake is necessary.

J	Maicher, C; Le Bailly, M				Maicher, Celine; Le Bailly, Matthieu			The impact of climate change upon intestinal parasites in central Europe during the 4th millennium BCE	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Neolithic period in Europe was subject to marked climatic variations during the fourth millennium BCE in the Alpine arc, marking the transition between the recent Atlantic and the Subboreal. This phase is characterized by falling temperatures and rising humidity in the Northern Hemisphere. Within this phase, between 3700 and 3250 BCE, a more intense phase takes place, known as Rootmoos 2 or Piora 2. This phase is characterized by a significant drop in lake water levels. This climatic change had repercussions on lakeside dwellers, notably through the modification and adaptation of their diet and subsistence modes. Intestinal parasites (helminths), found by human and animals via parasitic markers, seem to respond over time to these climatic variations. At first sight, low lake level phases are characterized by significant proportions of Trichuris at the expense of Diphyllobothrium, as well as an increase in Fasciola. These phases therefore seem to favour parasites indicative of agropastoral activities. During periods of high lake levels, Diphyllobothrium increase in number, pointing to a higher frequency of fishing practices. In sum, during periods of cooler/wetter climate, Neolithic lakeside populations seem to focus more on fishing produce, which may be a response to a destabilization of previously established agropastoral systems, marking a return to more opportunistic behaviour with the exploitation of products from the direct environment. This pilot study tends to evaluate if the evolution of parasitic communities in the 4th millennium BCE could therefore be used to complete our understanding of the effects of climatic variations on societies, both as a direct consequence of environmental destabilization (effect on the hosts) and the result of the behavioural adaptation of the inhabitants, even if it is still difficult to determine the importance of the influence of each factor on these variations. Despite some remaining challenges in the current study, the integration of paleoparasitic data into broader paleoenvironmental models appears promising. Future research can continue to develop along this path.					; Le Bailly, Matthieu/AAA-2977-2019	Le Bailly, Matthieu/0000-0001-6320-6741; Maicher, Celine/0000-0002-1221-620X; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				AUG 15	2024	338								108795	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108795		JUL 2024											WOS:001325329900001
J	Anthony, EJ; Lang, J; Oyede, LM				Anthony, EJ; Lang, J; Oyede, LM			Sedimentation in a tropical, microtidal, wave-dominated coastal-plain estuary	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Mono estuary is an infilled, microtidal estuary located on the wave-dominated Eight of Benin coast which is subject to very strong eastward longshore drift. The estuarine fill comprises a thick unit of lagoonal mud deposited in a 'central basin' between upland fluvial deposits and estuary-mouth wave-tide deposits. This lagoonal fill is capped by organic-rich tidal flat mud. In addition to tidal flat mud, the superficial facies overlying the 'central basin' fill include remnants of spits resting on transgressive/washover sand, an estuary-mouth association of beach, shoreface, flood-tidal delta and tidal inlet deposits, and a thin sheet of fluvial sediments deposited over tidal flat mud. After an initial phase of spit intrusion over the infilled central basin east of the present Mono channel, the whole estuary mouth became bounded by a regressive barrier formed from sand supplied by the Volta Delta during the middle Holocene eustatic highstand. Barrier progradation ceased late in the Holocene following the establishment of an equilibrium plan-form shoreline alignment that allowed through-drift of Volta sand to sediment sinks further downdrift. Over the same period, accretion, from fluvially supplied sediments, of the estuarine plain close to the limit of spring high tides, or, over much of the lower valley, into a fluvial plain no longer subject to tidal flooding, induced marked meandering of the Mono and its tidal distributaries in response to confinement of much of the tidal prism to these channels. The process resulted in erosion of spit/washover and regressive barrier sand, and in reworking of the tidal flat and floodbasin deposits. The strong longshore drift, equilibrium shoreline alignment and the year-round persistence of a tidal inlet maintained by discharge from the Mono and from Lake Aheme have resulted in a stationary barrier that is reworked by a mobile inlet. The Mono example shows that advanced estuarine infill may result in considerable facies reworking, obliteration of certain facies and marked spatial imbrication of fluvial, estuarine and wave-tide-deposited facies, and confirms patterns of sedimentary change described for microtidal estuaries on wave-influenced coasts. In addition, this study shows that local environmental factors such as sediment supply relative to limited accommodation space, and strong longshore drift, which may preclude accumulation of sediments in the vicinity of the estuary mouth, may lead to infilled equilibrium or near-equilibrium estuaries that will not necessarily evolve into deltas.

J	DUEBENDORFER, EM; SIMPSON, DA				DUEBENDORFER, EM; SIMPSON, DA			KINEMATICS AND TIMING OF TERTIARY EXTENSION IN THE WESTERN LAKE MEAD REGION, NEVADA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Explanation of the origin of the complex array of structures in some extensional terranes (including folds and normal, strike-slip, and reverse faults) includes many models that implicitly assume kinematic compatibility between and contemporaneous operation of these structures. We present new stratigraphic and age data from the highly extended western Lake Mead region, Nevada, together with an analysis of fault kinematics (technique of Marrett and Allmendinger, 1990) to test the assumptions of kinematic compatibility and contemporaneity of structures in an area of excellent exposure and superb stratigraphic control. Our analysis indicates an overlapping but clearly distinct chronology of deformation. Early regional extension (> 18?-13.5 Ma) is marked by development of a basin into which the middle Miocene lower Horse Spring Formation was deposited. In the western Lake Mead region, this basin was disrupted by more areally restricted, post-13 Ma normal and kinematically coupled right-slip faulting along the Las Vegas Valley shear zone. Kinematic analysis of faults indicates an average regional extension direction of nearly due west for the middle and late Miocene. Extension and right-slip faulting was followed by development of dominantly south-vergent contractional structures including tight, east-plunging folds and east-striking reverse faults. These structures deform the post-8.5 Ma Muddy Creek Formation; the Muddy Creek Formation is not cut by the Las Vegas Valley shear zone. Older faults, including the eastern Las Vegas Valley shear zone, reactivated as south-vergent reverse faults. Northeast-striking left-slip faults cut folds and reverse faults. These observations show that north-south shortening and left-slip faulting postdate the major phase of extension and right-slip faulting in the western Lake Mead area. Dynamic models that invoke either a single stress field or rotating stress fields to explain development of structures in the western Lake Mead area are inconsistent with the kinematic and age data. Similarly, kinematic models that view all structures in the context of a single strain field are precluded by systematic cross-cutting relationships that demonstrate at least partial diachroneity of deformational styles. Large-magnitude extension south of the Las Vegas Valley and Lake Mead fault zones appears to have been followed by north-south contraction that was highly localized near the region of greatest extension. We suggest that lateral pressure gradients arising from differential crustal thinning at the northern end of the Colorado River extensional corridor may have provided the driving mechanism for localized contractional deformation.																			0016-7606					AUG	1994	106	8					1057	1073		10.1130/0016-7606(1994)106<1057:KATOTE>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1994)106<1057:KATOTE>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PA14000005
J	Olga, IB				Olga, Bazhenova, I			CURRENT DYNAMICS OF FLUVIO-LACUSTRINE SYSTEMS OF ONON-TOREI HIGH PLAIN (SOUTHERN TRANSBAIKALIA)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The article shows the peculiarity of functioning conditions of fluvio-lacustrine systems of the Onon-Torei Plain, located at the southern boundary of the permafrost zone and along the northern boundary of the vast arid areas of Central Asia, as well as at the junction of the Upper Amur basin with an area of internal drainage. In these conditions the fluvio-lacustrine systems are highly dynamic. The course of exogenous relief-forming processes in time, and their interaction and interchange are considered; mechanisms of modern functioning of fluvio-lacustrine systems are discovered. The long term cycles of relief reshaping lasting for 27-35 years that include dynamic phases with different range of processes, direction, distance and intensity of substances transfer, are determined. The phases successively alternate in time and are invariant of systems functioning. In the normal zonal phase the near transport of matter conducted by slope processes of moderate intensity is observed, which results in the integration of matter in lake basins, the bottoms of canyons and river valleys. In the extremely wet transgressive phase the far fluvial transport of matter in the Upper Amur basin or stagnant lake basins dominates. Basin erosion is enhanced. Suspended sediment runoff module of the Borzya River increased by 15 times compared to the long-term average. Activation of gully erosion is characteristic for the phase, in the dynamics of the relief the role of cryogenic processes also increases dramatically. This increases the number of blow up and aufeis formation sites, expanding their area. In winter, the river channels form a chain of ice mounds, whose formation and destruction is accompanied by channel sediment transport. During extremely low humidity and lakes regression aeolian processes of high intensity dominate. Windward edges of coastal river benches are subjected to significant aeolian processing. On the surface of the river and lake terraces deflation basins are highly developed. Bottom sediments of lake bottoms dry baths are carried by the wind in a south-easterly direction to the stagnant areas of Mongolia. A tendency of expansion of Uldza-Torey endorheic basin that occurs on a background of aridization of the area under study over the past two thousand years should be considered in the forward estimates of changes in the relief area. Due to the fact that the intensity of aeolian migration of the substance is higher than the module flow of suspended sediments, the main stream of matter within the plain goes from the Onon basin to the internal drain. The boundaries of the individual lake basins and endorheic lake basins are shifted mainly to the north.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				JUN	2013		371					171	+																WOS:000421544500035
J	Lawlor, AJ; Tipping, E				Lawlor, AJ; Tipping, E			Metals in bulk deposition and surface waters at two upland locations in northern England	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Concentrations of aluminium and minor metals (Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd, Ba, Pb) were measured in precipitation and surface water at two upland locations (Upper Duddon Valley, UDV; Great Dun Fell, GDF) in northern England for 1 year commencing April 1998. At both locations, the loads in bulk precipitation were at the lower ends of ranges reported for other rural and remote sites, for the period 1985-1995. The deposited metals were mostly in the dissolved form, and their concentrations tended to be greatest when rainfall volumes were low. The concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb in deposition were correlated (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.40) with concentrations of non-marine sulphate. Three streams, ranging in mean pH from 5.07 to 7.07, and with mean concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) < 1 mg l(-1), were monitored at UDV, and two pools (mean pH 4.89 and 6.83, mean DOC 22 and 15 mg l(-1)) at GDF. Aluminium and the minor metals were mainly in the dissolved form, and in the following ranges (means of 49-51 samples, mug l(-1)): Al 36-530, Mn 4.4-36, Ni 0.26-2.8, Cu 0.25-1.7, Zn 2.1-30, Cd 0.03-0.16, Ba 1.9-140, Pb 0.10-4.5. Concentrations were generally higher at GDF. Differences in metal concentrations between the two locations and between waters at each location, and temporal variations in individual waters, can be explained qualitatively in terms of sorption to solid-phase soil organic matter and mineral surfaces, complexation and transport by DOC, and chemical weathering. The UDV catchments are sinks for Pb and sources of Al, Mn, Sr, Cd and Ba. The GDF catchments are sources of Al, Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cd and Ba. Other metals measured at the two locations are approximately in balance. Comparison of metal:silicon ratios in the surface waters with values for silicate rocks indicates enrichment of Ni and Cu, and substantial enrichment of Zn, Cd and Pb. These enrichments, together with high metal deposition in the past, make it likely that concentrations of the metals in the surface waters are governed by release from catchment pools of atmospherically-deposited metal. The catchments appear to be responding on a time scale of decades, possibly centuries, to changes in metal deposition. For the more acid waters at UDV, the calculated free-ion concentrations of Al are similar to published LC50 values for acute toxicity towards fish. The free-ion concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd in all the surface waters are one-to-four orders of magnitude lower than reported LC50 values for fish. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Optimizing Microclonal Propagation of Red Currant Cultivars: The Role of Nutrient Media, Sterilizers, and LED Lighting in Plant Adaptation	HORTICULTURAE												This study focuses on refining in vitro propagation protocols for red currant cultivars of the Ribes genus and evaluating the role of LED lighting in the adaptation of microplants. The cultivars 'Red Lake', 'Englische Grosse Weisse', 'Marmeladnitsa', and 'Podarok Leta' were successfully introduced into in vitro culture during their dormancy phase using 0.1% HgCl2 as a sterilizing agent. The period of spring introduction is not very efficient in connection with the intensive development of saprophytic microflora and weak morphogenesis microplants. Using 0.01% C9H9HgNaO2S sterilizer resulted in a decrease in the necrosis percentage, but an increase in mold proportion. The preparation of the plants with 12% H2O2 was considered environmentally not effective enough to obtain a large number of healthy microplants. The use of 12% H2O2 resulted in increased necrosis rates by 24.76% compared to 0.01% C9H9HgNaO2S and 0.1% HgCl2 sterilizers. The variety specificity of Ribesia plants in terms of the content of MS and LF nutrient media components was determined by the survival rate of explants, the formation of additional micro-shoots, and the morphological development. The MS medium with the addition of 1 mg center dot L-1 BAP decreased the percentage of mold and necrosis infection and provided a high percentage of viable plants with optimal growth and reproduction rate. In contrast, the LF medium with the same concentration of 6-BAP resulted in poor explant quality and leaf chlorosis at later stages. The study also investigated the effects of different LED light spectra on morphological and physiological traits. For 'Red Lake' and 'Englische Grosse Weisse', RWUV-A (625-740 nm) lighting enhanced biomass and chlorophyll (Chl a and Chl a + b) accumulation, while the White (W) spectrum benefited 'Podarok Leta'. Conversely, the RW spectrum with minimal green and no ultraviolet light restricted growth and photosynthetic pigment accumulation across all cultivars, promoting compact plant structures. The RWUV-A lighting condition resulted in the highest NDVI values across all cultivars, indicating an improved physiological status and biomass accumulation. These findings underscore the importance of refining the microclonal reproduction protocols for Ribesia subgenus representatives, emphasizing the genotype-specific light modulation during the proliferation stage. The study highlights the utility of the MS medium and tailored light conditions in enhancing the effectiveness of propagation techniques for producing high-quality planting material.

The description of the water systems includes an evaluation of the structure and interactions of water systems in and around the lakes since the beginning of the Holocene until recent times, focussing progressively from the regional to the local systems and from the lake complex to the individual lakes. Quantitative research concerned: monthly and annual water balances for the complex of lakes and for individual lakes; numerical two- and semi-three-dimensional groundwater flow models; field experiments on turbulence and diffusion; and experimental laboratory studies on wind-driven currents. Qualitative research concerned: behaviour of environmental isotopes in groundwater; heavy metals in lake bottom sediments; phosphorus balances of the complex of lakes and of individual lakes for the existing and the simulated conditions; and remote sensing studies for the water quality pattern recognition. The interaction between the various water systems in the area has been influenced strongly in historic and recent times by human interference on both the local and regional scales of the water resources, e.g. through the reclamation of lakes, the extraction of water for public water supply, the regional transfer of water, the agricultural and urban activities etc. Two major remedial measures have been taken thus far: construction of sewer systems, and the supply with dephosphorized water from the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. These measures resulted in a decrease of the external P-load but did not result in a significant decrease in eutrophication as yet. Scenario's to improve this situation either pertain to tackling the fundamental causes of the eutrophication or to redressing their effects. The first category includes: drastic reductions in groundwater abstraction for public supply in the Gooi catchment area of the lakes and (partial?) flooding of adjacent deep polder areas to reduce the leakage losses from the lakes (both measures aim at restoration of the water balance). The second category involves less drastic water management alternatives for lake restoration: dredging P-enriched bottom sediments; reinforced flushing during summer with dephosphorized Amsterdam-Rhine Canal water; interception and rerouting of polluted inflows from the watershed; or additional P-removal from yet untreated inflows.																			0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					21	38		10.1007/BF00016093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016093													WOS:A1992JD64800005

Recent studies have suggested that groundwater has played a key role in the remobilization, transport and deposition of iodine in Atacama over scales of millions-of-years. However, and considering that natural waters are also anomalously enriched in iodine in the region, the relative source contributions of iodine in the waters and its extent of mixing remain unconstrained. In this study we provide new halogen data and isotopic ratios of iodine (I-129/I) in shallow seawater, rivers, salt lakes, cold and thermal spring water, rainwater and groundwater that help to constrain the relative influence of meteoric, marine and crustal sources in the Atacama waters. Iodine concentrations in surface and ground waters range between 0.35 mu M and 26 mu M in the Tarapaca region and between 0.25 mu M and 48 mu M in the Antofagasta region, and show strong enrichment when compared with seawater concentrations (I = similar to 0.4 mu M). In contrast, no bromine enrichment is detected (1.3-45.7 mu M for Tarapaca and 1.7-87.4 mu M for Antofagasta) relative to seawater (Br = similar to 600 mu M). These data, coupled to the high I/Cl and low Br/Cl ratios are indicative of an organic-rich sedimentary source (related with an "initial" fluid) that interacted with meteoric water to produce a mixed fluid, and preclude an exclusively seawater origin for iodine in Atacama natural waters. Iodine isotopic ratios (I-129/I) are consistent with halogen chemistry and confirm that most of the iodine present in natural waters derives from a deep initial fluid source (i.e., groundwater which has interacted with Jurassic marine basement), with variable influence of at least one atmospheric or meteoric source. Samples with the lowest isotopic ratios (I-129/I from similar to 215 to similar to 1000 x 10(-15)) strongly suggest mixing between the groundwater and iodine storage in organic-rich rocks (with variable influence of volcanic fluids) and pre-anthropogenic meteoric water, while samples with higher values (similar to 2000-93,700 x 10(-15)) indicate the input of anthropogenic meteoric fluid. Taking into account the geological, hydrologic and climatic features of the Atacama region, we propose that the mean contribution of anthropogenic I-129 is associated with I-129 releases during nuclear weapon tests carried out in the central Pacific Ocean until the mid 1990's (I-129/I = similar to 12,000 x 10(-15)). This source reflects rapid redistribution of this radioisotope on a global scale. Our results support the notion of a long-lived continental iodine cycle in the hyperarid margin of western South America, which is driven by local hydrological and climate conditions, and confirm that groundwater was a key agent for iodine remobilization and formation of the extensive iodine-rich soils of Atacama.

J	DORSEY, RJ; BECKER, U				DORSEY, RJ; BECKER, U			EVOLUTION OF A LARGE MIOCENE GROWTH-STRUCTURE IN THE UPPER PLATE OF THE WHIPPLE DETACHMENT FAULT, NORTHEASTERN WHIPPLE MOUNTAINS, CALIFORNIA	BASIN RESEARCH												Miocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the north-eastern Whipple Mountains, California, and the north-western Aubrey Hills, Arizona, accumulated in the upper plate of the Whipple detachment fault during regional extension and slip on the detachment. Miocene rocks in this area can be divided into three sequences: (1) pre-18.5-Ma dominantly volcanic rocks; (2) the 18.5-Ma Peach Springs Tuff; and (3) post-18.5-Ma dominantly sedimentary rocks. Important stratigraphic markers in sequence 3 include a 100- to 140-m-thick basalt unit and the voluminous War Eagle landslide, both of which correlate across Lake Havasu from the north-east Whipple Mountains to the Aurbrey Hills. We divide elastic sedimentary rocks of sequence 3 into three informal members: (3a) conglomerate and sandstone stratigraphically beneath the basalt; (3b) conglomerate and sandstone above the basalt and below the War Eagle landslide; and (3c) conglomerate and sandstone that overlie the War Eagle landslide. Detailed stratigraphic analysis and field mapping reveal dramatic south-westward thickening of member 3b strata, from about 50 m in the Aubrey Hills to over 1500 m in the north-east Whipple Mountains. In the north-east Whipple Mountains, this thick dipping section is overlain by the War Eagle landslide along a major angular unconformity; in the Aubrey Hills the base of the War Eagle landslide is roughly parallel to bedding dips of underlying strata. The above stratigraphic relationships can be explained by syndepositional growth of a rollover monocline by progressive tilting of the hangingwall above a master listric normal fault (Whipple detachment fault). This phase of upper-plate deformation began shortly after deposition of the basalt and ended prior to emplacement of the War Eagle landslide. Interbedded breccias low in member 3b, about 100 m above the basalt, record the first appearance of mylonitic detritus in the section. Growth of this upper-plate rollover was thus initiated at about the same time (shortly after deposition of the basalt) that the lower plate of the Whipple detachment fault was first exposed at the earth's surface by tectonic denudation and large-scale crustal uplift. These events are interpreted to record initiation of a secondary breakaway fault on the north-east flank of the growing Whipple detachment dome shortly after deposition of the basalt at about 14.5 (+/-1.0)Ma.

Holocene environmental changes in southern Kamchatka, Far Eastern Russia, inferred from a pollen and testate amoebae peat succession record	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												High resolution palaeoenvironmental records in Far-Eastern Russia are rare, and the Kamchatka Peninsula is among the least studied areas of the region. This paper describes a record spanning the last ca. 11,000 yr, obtained from a bog in the southern part of Kamchatka. The radiocarbon dated core was analysed for pollen, testate amoebae, charcoal and loss-on-ignition (LOI). The vegetation during the early Holocene was dominated by grasses (Poaceae), birch (Betula) and heath (Ericaceae p. p.). Around 10,300 cal yr BP there was a substantial change in the vegetation cover to shrub alder (Alnus viridis s.I.) stands with sedges and ferns (Polypodiophyta) as well as herbs such as meadow rue (Thalictrum) in the understory. In the surroundings of Utka peatlands started to form. The variations in the vegetation cover were most probably caused by climatic changes. At the beginning of sediment accumulation, before 10,300 cal yr BP, the composition of the vegetation points to cooler summers and/or decreased annual precipitation. Around 10,300 cal yr BP, changes in vegetation occurred due to rising temperatures and/or changed water regimes. Increased abundancies of dry indicating testate amoebae after 9100 cal yr BP point to intermediate to dry soil conditions. Between 8600 and 7700 cal yr BP tree alder (Alnus incana) was widely spread at the site which probably indicates optimal environmental conditions. The tephra layer at 381-384.5 cm (ca. 8500 cal yr BP) produces a strong impact on the testate amoebae assemblages. At 7700 cal yr BP there was a sudden drop of A. incana in the local vegetation. From this time on, A. incana and also A. viridis decrease continuously whereas Betula gradually increases. The upper part of the sequence (after 6300 cal yr BP) shows higher abundancies of meadowsweet (Filipendula) and sweet gale (Myrica) pollen. After 6300 cal yr BP, changes in testate amoebae demonstrate variable soil moisture conditions at the site. Between 3700 and 1800 cal yr BP, wet conditions dominate as dry indicating testate amoebae decrease. After 1800 cal yr BP soil conditions become more variable again but this time with dry dominating testate amoebae. In contrast to surrounding regions, there is no evidence of trees such as spruce or larch growing in the surroundings of the site even though those trees are characteristic of many eastern Siberian sites. This difference might be because of the maritime influence of the Okhotsk Sea. Even dwarf pine (Pinus pumila), which is currently widely dispersed in northern Kamchatka, became part of the local vegetation only during the last 700 yr.

Holocene palaeogeographies of the Astakos coastal plain (Akarnania, NW Greece)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper deals with Holocene coastal changes of the Astakos plain in Akarnania, NW Greece. Palaeoenvironmental scenarios are based on the analysis of the lateral and vertical distribution patterns of sedimentary facies. Sediments from vibracorings were studied using geomorphological, sedimentological, microfaunal, palacobotanical and geochemical methods. A geochronostratigraphy was achieved by 14 C-ANIS-dating of organic matter. We present palaeogeographical maps for different points in time since the mid-Holocene. The evolution of the coastal area was generally controlled by the migration of a complex system of a shallow marine embayment, an adjacent lagoonal environment and an adjoining coastal lake forced by the interaction of sea level rise, tectonic movements, and sediment supply from the hinterland. The maximum transgression of the Ionian Sea took place at circa 5500 cal BC reaching approx. 1.1 km inland. The lagoon as well as the coastal lake had their largest dimensions around 4500 cal BC indicating a more humid climatic period. In the course of a long-lasting regression, an asymmetric sedimentation pattern developed. Around 2500 cal BC it was characterized by strong fluvial deposition of the Xeropotamos in the western plain and a small and narrow marine embayment with associated lagoonal to limnic coastal water bodies in the eastern plain. The latter were related to karstic springs draining the adjacent Rigani ridge. Around 500 cal BC the coastline lay about 200 m landward of its present position. Possible harbour sites for the ancient polis of Astakos are (a) the area of modem Astakos where a mole in a position seawards of the present coast would have guaranteed deep water conditions for anchoring, or (b) the southeastern fringe of the plain where deep water prevailed and the nearby freshwater outlet protected the site from rapid siltation. We found increased torrential activity (i) for the 6th-5th millennium BC, (ii) for the 2nd half of the 1st millennium BC until Roman times, and (iii) at the end of the 19th century AD. At least the two younger phases are mostly due to anthropogenic soil erosion. Between the 4th and the 2nd millennium BC a period of ecological stability existed. Relative changes in sea level for the Bay of Astakos were reconstructed for the first time. Since the mid-Holocene, the relative sea level has never reached a higher position than today. It rose from 12.50 m b.s.l. at 6200 cal BC via 2.20 m b.s.l. at 500 cal BC to its present level. Besides eustatic reasons, tectonic subsidence due to the half graben structure of the area is the main trigger of the relative rise in sea level. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the Dongdaohaizi Depression of the eastern Junggar Basin, the provenance of the Middle Jurassic Sangonghe Formation remains contentious. In this study, representative sandstone samples were systematically collected from all three members of the Sangonghe Formation in both the Dongdaohaizi Depression and its western margin. Through comprehensive petrographic and geochemical analyses, we obtained the following results. The Sangonghe Formation is primarily composed of feldspathic lithic sandstones, lithic sandstones, and minor lithic-feldspathic sandstones. The heavy mineral assemblage includes zircon, garnet, chromite, and rutile, suggesting source rocks of intermediate to acidic igneous, metamorphic, and mafic lithologies. The total REE contents range from 101.84 to 192.68 mu g/g, with an average of 161.80 mu g/g. The & sum;LREE/& sum;HREE ratios vary from 6.59 to 13.25 (average 10.96), and the average delta Eu values are close to 1. The delta Ce value ranges from 1.09 to 1.13 (average 1.11). Trace element discrimination diagrams, including La-Th-Sc, Th-Co-Zr/10, Th-Sc-Zr/10, and La/Y-Sc/Cr ternary plots, indicate that most samples fall within the continental island arc domain, with a few plotting in the passive continental margin field. Comparison with potential surrounding source regions reveals dual provenances: an eastern source from the Kalamaili Mountains and a western source from the Zhayier Mountains. During the Early Jurassic, these two orogenic belts acted as distinct sediment sources. The Zhayier Mountains provided stronger input, with fluvial and tidal processes transporting sediments into the basin, establishing the primary subsidence center in the west of the depression. By the Middle Jurassic, continued thrusting of surrounding fold belts caused a migration of the lake center and the main depocenter to the western edge of the Dongdaohaizi Depression, while the former depocenter gradually diminished. Furthermore, sustained erosion and denudation of the Mosowan Uplift during the Early-Middle Jurassic reduced its function as a structural barrier, thereby promoting increased mixing between eastern and western sediment sources. The study not only refines existing paleogeographic models of the Junggar Basin, but also demonstrates the utility of REE-trace geochemistry in deciphering complex provenance systems in tectonically active basins.

J	Rood, DH; Burbank, DW; Finkel, RC				Rood, Dylan H.; Burbank, Douglas W.; Finkel, Robert C.			Spatiotemporal patterns of fault slip rates across the Central Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Patterns in fault slip rates through time and space are examined across the transition from the Sierra Nevada to the Eastern California Shear Zone-Walker Lane belt. At each of four sites along the eastern Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone between 38 and 39 degrees N latitude, geomorphic markers, such as glacial moraines and outwash terraces, are displaced by a suite of range-front normal faults. Using geomorphic mapping, surveying, and Be-10 surface exposure dating, mean fault slip rates are defined, and by utilizing markers of different ages (generally, similar to 20 ka and similar to 150 ka), rates through time and interactions among multiple faults are examined over 10(4)-10(5) year timescales. At each site for which data are available for the last similar to 150 ky, mean slip rates across the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone have probably not varied by more than a factor of two over time spans equal to half of the total time interval (similar to 20 ky and similar to 150 ky timescales): 03 +/- 0.1 mm year(-1) (mode and 95% CI) at both Buckeye Creek in the Bridgeport basin and Sonora Junction; and 0.4 + 03/-0.1 mm year(-1) along the West Fork of the Carson River at Woodfords. Data permit rates that are relatively constant over the time scales examined. In contrast, slip rates are highly variable in space over the last similar to 20 ky. Slip rates decrease by a factor of 3-5 northward over a distance of similar to 20 km between the northern Mono Basin (1.3 + 0.61-03 mm year(-1) at Lundy Canyon site) to the Bridgeport Basin (03 +/- 0.1 mm year(-1)). The 3-fold decrease in the slip rate on the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone northward from Mono Basin is indicative of a change in the character of faulting north of the Mina Deflection as extension is transferred eastward onto normal faults between the Sierra Nevada and Walker Lane belt. A compilation of regional deformation rates reveals that the spatial pattern of extension rates changes along strike of the Eastern California Shear Zone-Walker Lane belt South of the Mina Deflection, extension is accommodated within a diffuse zone of normal and oblique faults, with extension rates increasing northward on the Fish Lake Valley fault Where faults of the Eastern California Shear Zone terminate northward into the Mina Deflection, extension rates increase northward along the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone to similar to 0.7 mm year(-1) in northern Mono Basin. This spatial pattern suggests that extension is transferred from more easterly fault systems, e.g., Fish Lake Valley fault, and localized on the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone as the Eastern California Shear Zone-Walker Lane belt faulting is transferred through the Mina Deflection.

J	LaybournParry, J; EllisEvans, JC; Butler, H				LaybournParry, J; EllisEvans, JC; Butler, H			Microbial dynamics during the summer ice-loss phase in maritime Antarctic lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The dynamics of bacterioplankton and protozooplankton in two maritime Antarctic lakes (Heywood Lake and Sombre Lake, Signy Island, South Orkneys) were studied during the phase of ice break-out (December and early January 1994/95). The lakes are suffering animal-induced (fur seal) eutrophication, though Heywood Lake is most severely affected. Both lakes had morphologically diverse bacterial communities which increased during the study period, reaching maxima of 80 x 10(8) l(-1) in Heywood Lake and 31.8 x 10(8) l(-1) in Sombre Lake. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) reached a peak in late December with maxima of 40.6 x 10(5) l(-1) in Sombre Lake and 174 x 10(5) l(-1) in Heywood Lake. Phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN) peaked in late December after ice loss in Heywood Lake (63 x 10(5) l(-1)), which coincided with a peak in a bloom of Chroomonas acuta which reached abundances of 1.0 x 10(8) l(-1). In Sombre Lake, ice persisted for a longer period and here PNAN reached their highest density at the end of the study period (around 70.0 x 10(5) l(-1)). Ciliate abundance reached high levels in Heywood Lake (>6000 l(-1)), while in Sombre Lake maximum abundance was 568 l(-1). Protozooplankton diversity was greater in the less-enriched Sombre Lake. Grazing rates of ciliates averaged 70.6 bacteria indiv.(-1) h(-1) in Heywood Lake and 119.3 bacteria indiv.(-1) h(-1) in Sombre Lake. The difference was a reflection of the different taxonomic make-up of the community in the lakes. HNAN grazing rates varied between 0.51 and 0.83 bacteria indiv.(-1) h(-1) Sombre and Heywood Lakes, respectively. Specific growth rates (r) h(-1) in Sombre Lake were 0.028 for ciliates and 0.013 for HNAN, and in Heywood Lake 0.010 for ciliates and HNAN 0.012. These growth rates result in doubling times ranging between 38 and 69 h for ciliates and around 55 h for HNAN. HNAN grazing on bacteria was curtailed in Heywood Lake in early January as a result of predation by microcrustacean larvae feeding on the plankton. Thus, for a short phase top-down control was apparent in the dynamics of Heywood Lake, a feature uncommon in Antarctic lake ecosystems. The impact of natural eutrophication on these systems is discussed in relation to other unaffected Antarctic lakes.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				APR	1996	18	4					495	511		10.1093/plankt/18.4.495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.4.495													WOS:A1996UF93600003

However, the influence of lithofacies and depositional processes for mudstone intervals in deep-lake environments on the development of shale oil sweet-spot intervals is unclear. Based on observations and descriptions of cores, thin-sections, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) images, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and trace element data, combined with data and images of the quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscope (QEMSCAN), nine mudstone lithofacies (ML) are recognized in the mudstone intervals. They are organic-rich horizontally laminated mudstone (ML1), organic-rich horizontally laminated tuffaceous mudstone (ML2), organic-rich massive mudstone (ML3), laminated silty mudstone with silty clasts/fragments (ML4), convolute bedded silty mudstone (ML5), silty mudstone with lenticular and irregular silty clasts/fragments aligned along bedding (ML6), ripple-cross laminated silty mudstone (ML7), ripple laminated silty mudstone (ML8), and graded bedded silty mudstone (ML9). A warm, wet climate is indicated, together with regional flooding and anoxic events, lake-level rises and falls, tectonic phases and volcanic eruptions, all of which helped to form the MLs in deep-ake environments. ML1 and ML2 were deposited by suspension settling, turbulent flows, or hyperpycnal currents in deep water. ML3 and ML9 were deposited by muddy turbulent flows that settled at a rapid or moderate sedimentation rate. ML4 was deposited by cohesive mudflows. ML5 and ML6 were deposited by a typical "freezing" depositional mechanism involving a thin silty mud layer slide or cohesive fine-grained debris flows. ML7 and ML8 were deposited by lacustrine bottom-currents and fine-grained transitional flows respectively, which resulted from turbulent flows linked to monsoon rainfall. Fine-grained gravity flow sediments were deposited in distal lobes, levees in silty channel-levee-lobe systems, or in distal sub-lacustrine fans. Slack-water fallout sediments were developed in quiet, deep-water lakes, in interchannels, and interlobes in channel-levee- lobe systems, or between sub-lacustrine fans in deep-lake environments. ML4-ML9, intercalated with lithofacies ML1 to ML3 with high total organic carbon (TOC) contents, constituting good source-reservoir assemblages, are favorable "sweet-spot intervals" for shale oil development.

The sources included natural water (lake, river, and water well), treated water (swimming pool and drinking water), and water in contact with fish (fish tank and aquarium). The water samples were collected from November 1984 to October 1985 and from January through November 1987. One litre of each water sample was filtered using filter membrane (0,45um). Membranes that filtered more polluted waters (lakes, rivers and fish tanks) were first inoculated in 5ml of Brain Heart Infusion and incubated at 35.degree. C during 6 hours for spore germination. Than, all membranes were treated with a solution of 40% H2SO4 during 10 minutes and neutralized with a 30% solution of NaOH. The mixture was centrifuged and the sediment resuspended in 2,0ml of sterilized destilled water. The suspension (0,2ml) of each water samples was inoculated in 4 tubes of Lowestein-Jensen (L-J) medium and 4 tubes of L-J with 500um/ml of actidione (Upjohn). The tubes were incubated at 30.degree. C and 37.degree. C and examined weekly during a 7 weeks period. The identification of the suspected cultures was made using the routine tests (growth on Nutrient Agar; Pigmentation in dark and light; niacin accumulation; enzymes activities; Iron uptake; Growth on MacConkey Agar; Growth in presence of: NaCl, Hydroxylamine, Capreomycine, Cicloserine, Ethambutol, p-Aminosalicylate, Thiophen-2 carboxylic acid hidrazide, Thiosemicarbazone and p-Nitrobenzoic acid) with the addition of the analysis of the micolic acids profiles. Water samples from the aquarium contained the greatest abundance of mycobacterium with 88,6% of positive sources and followed by water of well (33,3%); lake and river (29,4%), swimming pool water (28,2%); fish tank (16,6%); spring (12,5%) and drinking water (4,2%). The mycobacteria was absent in all of the artesian wells samples. 63.3% of positive cultures were rapidly growing mycobacteria and the others were slowly growing. 63,7% of cultures were members of Myeobacterium fortuitum presents in varieties of water samples. The others potentially pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated in minor frequency. It was verified that many of the samples analysed were contaminated with potentially pathogenic mycobacteria and other mycobacteria. The most fruitful sources were the water associated with fish and man (aquarium and swimming pool).

However, comprehensive multi-variable field observations are especially rare on large glaciers and on debris-covered glaciers. Here we present extensive field observations from Kennicott Glacier, a heavily debris-covered glacier in central Alaska covering more than 400 km(2). The multi-year data set includes point glacier mass balances, meteorological data from several weather stations on and off the glacier, debris thickness and temperature, ice cliff back wasting derived from time-lapse photography of horizontal stakes drilled into several cliffs, and bathymetry, water temperature, and water level of proglacial and supraglacial lakes. Cumulated summer melt of more than 8 m was observed at the lowest clean-ice sites. Melt rates over clean ice correlate well with elevation, while the rates over debris-covered ice lack any strong elevation dependence. Melt rates drop exponentially with increasing debris thickness and tend to be much lower than for clean ice at similar elevations. Melt rates determined for ice cliffs in areas of otherwise continuous debris cover were up to 10x those for debris-covered ice, and even exceeded standard clean ice melt rates. Debris-cover thickness measurements at 150 sites vary from < 1 to 69 cm with an average of 17 +/- 11 cm (+/- standard deviation). Debris thickens down-glacier, but with high spatial variability-thickness was observed to vary by tens of cm within a similar to 15 m radius. Depth-averaged thermal heat conductivity derived from supraglacial debris temperature profiles at 12 sites ranges from 0.53 to 1.86 W m(-1) K-1. Interconnected proglacial lakes covered 1.61 km(2) in 2018 with observed water depths of more than 60 m in the two largest lakes. The dataset can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14625691 (Petersen, Hock, Loso, Guo, et al., 2024) and will be useful for glaciological and glacier meteorological studies.

J	Cui, K; Wang, YB; Liu, XQ; Shen, J; Wang, Y				Cui, Kai; Wang, Yongbo; Liu, Xingqi; Shen, Ji; Wang, Yong			Stepwise intensification of human activities over the past two millennia in Southwest China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												As human activities accelerate landscape change, it is crucial to evaluate the potential impacts of natural climate fluctuations and anthropogenic disturbances. Accordingly, a continuous sediment record covering the past two millennia was collected from Beihai Wetland, Yunnan Province. The geochemical elemental compositions and organic material content were subsequently analyzed to evaluate the interactions between climate and human activities on the sedimentation process. The geochemical elements, such as K, Ti, Fe and Al, illustrate an overall increase in detrital inputs following catchment erosion. The total organic carbon content and C/N ratio suggest that organic matter deposition gradually decreased while terrestrial contribution increased. The geochemical indices mainly respond to regional moisture conditions before 1000 CE, and show a broadly consistent pattern with the intensity of Asian Summer Monsoon, suggesting that climate variation was a predominant factor in the catchment erosion and deposition process. Accordingly, the collapse of Nanzhao Kingdom in southwest China in 902 CE is supposed to be closely associated with an exceptionally weak monsoon phase between 900 and 1000 CE. During the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, the terrestrial contributions (indicated by compositions of Ti, Fe, K, Al, and C/N ratio) increased significantly, which cannot be solely attributed to the gradual decline in monsoonal precipitation. The substantial population growth and implementation of production policies in southwest China provide a plausible explanation for such phenomenon. Since the Ming Dynasty, the impact of human activities on the landscape evolution and subsequent sedimentation process gradually increased and overcame the impact of natural climate fluctuations. In addition, various sediment records and historical documents have also supported the gradual intensification of human activity in southwest China over the past two millennia. The results revealed the interactive influence of climate change and human activities on the sedimentation process, providing a scientific basis for understanding the mechanisms of environmental changes during historical periods.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2025	677								113185	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.113185													WOS:001554517100002

Circulation Factors for the Current Low Water Level within the Lake Baikal Drainage Basin	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												We examined the relationships between the dynamics of surface inflow into Lake Baikal and the runoff of the main tributaries of the Baikal drainage basin and regional and global circulation parameters to determine the role of certain of the meteorological factors in the current low water level within the Baikal catchment area. A decrease or an increase in the runoff of Baikal's rivers in the summer months depends on the synoptic situation in the south of East Siberia and in the north of Mongolia where southern cyclones provide the main influx of moisture to the Baikal region. We used different indices as climatic and circulation factors which characterize the specific features in the forms of atmospheric circulation in high and low latitudes of the northern hemisphere (NAO, AO, SCAND, and others) as well as the anomalies of mean monthly values of surface pressure and geopotential heights of isobaric surface AT-500 in the zone of 43-50 degrees N and 90-115 degrees E. It was found that the low water level within the Lake Baikal drainage basin has persisted since 1996 but it has manifested itself particularly clearly due to the lake stage reduction. In the south of Siberia and in the north of Mongolia, since the early 21(st) century there has been an enhancement in anticyclogenesis processes accompanied by an increase in air temperature, surface pressure and geopotential altitudes at the level of the mid-troposphere (5 km). The more favorable conditions for river runoff formation are created during the development of the ridge of elevated and low pressure over Ural and the associated ridge of low pressure over Siberia, with cyclogenesis processes occurring in front of them over the territory of Mongolia and the south of East Siberia at the Earth's surface. Elevated precipitation and runoff are observed at the time of blocking anticyclones over Transbaikalia and the Far East, which are responsible for a long-lasting persistence of Mongolian cyclones.

Suvasvesi S was first noticed in satellite images and might form a crater doublet with the proven Suvasvesi N impact structure. We have previously presented evidence, such as presence of fractured target rocks and shatter-cone boulders on the eastern shore of Haapaselk5, which suggest that the Suvasvesi South is also an impact structure. During the summer 2002 we carried out a field survey in the area of the Suvasvesi lakes, which led to additional discoveries of shatter cones in boulders. We also discovered impact melt boulders in gravel pits along the roadsides, about 5 km southeast of the structure. Microscopic studies of the thin sections of impact melt and of the shatter cone boulders reveal the presence of well developed and decorated PDFs in quartz grains, maskelynite, fluidal textures between impact melt mineral clasts and kink bands in micas. Consequently, the melt rock is considered to be of impact origin. It is unlikely that the boulders with shatter cones and impact melt blocks were derived from the northern structure, because material transported from it by ice drift would not have passed this area. The outcrops on the islets of the Suvasvesi South area are heavily fractured with subvertical NNW-SSE and ENE-WSW trending; however the fracturing may be related to the Svecofennian tectonic deformations occurring in this area. Also, the outcrops show shatter cone features with a maximum of 50 cm in size. We interpret the shatter cone features to be of impact origin because of their shape and because the orientation of their apices differ from the other deformation systems. However, thin section analysis from outcrop specimens has not shown impact evidence so far. The new findings suggest the presence of an eroded impact melt layer in the southern structure. Bathymetric and airborne magnetic data point to a distinct structure of smaller dimension than the northern one. Preliminary paleomagnetic measurements on the granitic host rocks of Suvasvesi South reveal two components, of which one (steep downwards) is probably either a hard viscous remanence of present age or a Svecofennian age feature. The other one is poorly defined, but has a southwest direction similar to that isolated for the northern structure and could be related to impact.					; Werner, Stephanie/A-6438-2012; Salminen, Juha-Pekka/N-3313-2017; Plado, Juri/Y-2405-2018; Plado, Jüri/Y-2405-2018	Salminen, Johanna/0000-0001-5347-1920; Pesonen, Lauri J./0000-0001-7410-4193; Plado, Juri/0000-0001-7473-6043; 															3-540-25735-7				2006							287	+		10.1007/3-540-25736-5_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-25736-5_13													WOS:000237271800013

It is hydrologically more stable than the other, endorheic lakes in Kenya, because it is deep - maximum depth at present just over 10 m in an area of 3000 ha - and so does not have periods when it is dry. It is ecologically simple, with only one species dominating the phytoplankton - the cyanobacterium 'spirulina', Arthrospira fusiformis. Its biomass and productivity were very high - biomass between 38 and 365 mu g l(-1) chlorophyll 'a' and 3.4-21 x 10(3) coils ml(-1) and net production between 0.24 and 1 gm C m3 h, the latter in a narrow zone of less than a metre. There were no macro-zooplankton in the plankton and the only grazer of A. fusiformis was the lesser flamingo, Phoeniconaias minor, which occurred irregularly in very high concentrations (in excess of 1 x 10(6)). Detritivory in the benthos was effected by a single chironomid species, Paratendipes sp., at a maximum density of 4 x 10(4) m(-2). The mean daily emergence of adult chironomids was estimated to be 1 x 10(3) m(-2), the maximum 3. There was no littoral plant community within the ake but 44 dicotyledonous and 31 monocotyledonous plant species in the drawn-down zone and adjacent to it. A diverse draw-down terrestrial invertebrate fauna, only superficially described here, rocessed the flamingo feathers and carcasses, with other detritus such as chironomid pupal exuviae and decaying A. fusiformis scum. About 50 bird species depended upon the chironomids, either as hey emerged through the water column as flying adults or later on the shoreline as floating pupal exuvia and dead adults. The lake has high conservation value because of three bird species in particular - lesser flamingo, Cape teal and black-necked grebe. The former provides real economic value in a region otherwise impoverished, because of the spectacle of tens of thousands of lamingos set against the landscape of hot springs and fumaroles at the lake edge, which draws 15 000 visitors per annum. P. minor has experienced three periods during the past ten years when major mortalities have occurred, the last of which killed 700 birds day(-1). This could have involved as many as 200 000 birds (about 1/5th of the maximum population at this lake) if mortality was at a constant rate for the nine months it was observed. Causes of mortality have been suggested as avian tuberculosis, poisoning from cyanobacterial toxins or from heavy metal contamination at Lake Nakuru, but it is still not yet clear what contribution each makes to the problem.					; Mills, Suzanne/K-5538-2012	Erick Nickson, Otieno/0000-0001-8840-1519; Mills, Suzanne Caroline/0000-0001-8948-3384													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2003	500	1-3					259	+		10.1023/A:1024722821407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024722821407													WOS:000184071400024

Climatic Conditions of Steppe and Tundra Formations in the Altai Highland Depressions	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												Data on the climate and vegetation of the Altai highland depressions are mapped in this paper. The Bertek depression (located 2200-2400 m above sea level) and the lake depression of Khindiktig-Khol' (2300-2400 m a.s.l.) were chosen as study objects. The investigation is based on information about vegetation and microclimatic differences obtained during 2018 field research. Long-term observations of Bertek and Mugur-Aksy meteorological stations are applied to climate characteristics. Steppe vegetation is typical for the depressions. Tundra species also exist alongside steppe ones within the Khindiktig-Khol' region, though in some cases a mosaic of tundra and steppe is found. Tundra communities are insignificant within the Bertek depression. Vegetation cover of the depressions develops under the conditions of a short-term vegetation period and undergoes the negative impact of low summer temperatures (mean July temperatures in Bertek are 9.3 degrees C; in Khindiktig-Khol'-10.8 degrees C). The data are significantly lower than the mean temperatures of the flat steppe zone. Taking into account the temperature data, the investigated areas are associated with the tundra zone. The climate humidification level is not enough to develop the continuous cover of tundra cenosis (Vysotskii-Ivanov's precipitation-evaporation ratio of Khindiktig-Khol' equals 0.74; in Bertek - 0.61). According to the fact above, the Khindiktig-Khol' depression is more humid, and the tundra communities live together with the steppe vegetation. Microclimatic observations of the neighboring areas with different tundra and steppe cenoses show that the species composing tundra with the dwarf birch (Betula rotundifolia) have unique features that create favorable conditions for the existence of this community. In comparison with the steppe area, the air during the daytime heats up better not only above the tundra pattern, but also beneath it. Moreover, the dwarf birch (Betula rotundifolia) maintains snow cover, which results in better soil humidification. Consequently, the vegetation cover is more diverse in the Khindiktig-Khol' depression, making it possible to figure out the appearance of its exclusive tundra and steppe mixture.					; Lessovaia, Sofia/I-4838-2013; Tyusov, Gregory/AAD-6778-2019; Amosov, Mikhail/O-5291-2014; Volkov, Illya/K-5221-2013; Chistyakov, Kirill/M-8489-2013	Kurochkin, Yurii/0000-0002-9139-5604; Lessovaia, Sofia/0000-0001-9789-4618; Volkov, Ilia/0000-0001-9374-2676; Tyusov, Gregory/0000-0002-4128-0227; Amosov, Mikhail/0000-0001-8126-9463; 													2541-9668	2587-585X					2019	64	4					612	627		10.21638/spbu07.2019.407	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/spbu07.2019.407													WOS:000512303900007

Most nannograins are elongate parallel to their c-axis and individual layers are composed to grains which are tangentially, normally (radially) or randomly oriented with respect to the ooid surface. This orientation may be determined petrographically or with a scanning electron microscope. Evidence from the Great Salt Lake and other ooid-forming environments that relates ooid-forming processes to ooid structure generally falls into 3 categories: randomly oriented aragonite and organic influences; tangentially oriented aragonite and the role of agitation; and radially oriented aragonite and normal crystal growth. Living microorganisms play a destructive, not constructive role in ooid growth and are not present in most Great Salt Lake ooids. Organic matter in both marine and Great Salt Lake ooids may play an important role as an adhesive during cortex accretion. Although the general physical conditions of ooid formation are known, detailed knowledge of the mechanism of ooid growth is lacking. Few hypotheses account for the tangential orientation of nannograins in the ooid cortex and those that do evoke a modification of Sorby''s snowball hypothesis. Some snowballing of Great Salt Lake ooids is indicated by clays in the ooids, which match the detrital clays in the lake. Radial grains in Great Salt Lake ooids range in length from 1-100 .mu.. They display petrographic relationships that are ambiguous relative to their origin, but a magnesium-rich zone around large radial grains suggests these result from an early reorganization of a precursory material. Large radial grains are interpreted as secondary features, albeit syndepositional. These grains are the result of recrystallization only if the postulated earlier precipitate was CaCO3. Ooids with large-scale radial fabric, like those of the Great Salt Lake, are characteristic of hypersaline and freshwater environments. The radial fabric renders Great Salt Lake ooids weaker than tangential Bahamian-type ooids of the same size and shape. This produces broken ooids in Great Salt Lake ooid sands. Syndepositionally broken ooids are associated with several evaporitic ancient oolites but are very rare in normal marine oolites. Broken ooids are considered significant indicators of unusual salinity if they comprise more than 1% of the grains in an oolite.

Wadi-versus aeolian-dominated flanks of the basin present two distinct records of geomorphic and sedimentologic response to global climatic change, as modulated by large-and small-scale changes in regional water balance. Differences between these areas illustrate distinctions between the responses of systems to external forcing mechanisms versus preservation of those responses in the stratigraphic record, and an apparent differential sensitivity to climatic change. The wadi-dominated northeast side of the basin, located along the flanks of the tectonically-active Atlas Ranges, provides a high-amplitude, low frequency record of four major wadi-lacustrine cycles during the last two glacial-interglacial periods. Individual cycles are preserved as a series of mappable terraces and incised valley fills, with facies successions that represent lowstand, transgressive, highstand, and early regressive parts of each lacustrine cycle. Available chronological data suggest lacustrine highstands correlate with interglacial/interstadial warm periods, whereas major episodes widespread basin-floor deflation, and valley incision correlate to orbitally-forced glacial or stadial cool periods. In spite of clear evidence for spatially-variable uplift or subsidence of individual palaeovalley axes, the wadi-lacustrine record remains robust, which further supports the conclusion that sedimentary rhythms reflect the major climate changes of the last 200 ky. However, syndepositional tectonism has partitioned the basin into topographic highs and subbasins, and will ultimately control the locations where the wadi-lacustrine record will be eroded away or preserved as part of the foreland basin fill. Aeolian landforms and deposits dominate the southern margins, but the long-term history is mostly one of deflation and sediment removal to downwind regions farther south and west (Grand Erg Oriental). However, remaining aeolian-lacustrine strata provide a high-resolution record of multiple high frequency humid-arid cycles since the last full-glacial maximum (ca. 20 ka). Aeolian units were mostly deposited as water tables fell during the drying phase of each cycle when large parts of the playa floor were exposed to deflation, whereas dune field stabilization by vegetation and/or gypsum crust formation occurred during humid periods when the water table rose. Location on the 'cratonic' margins of the basin, coupled with the overall long-term negative sediment budget, suggests limited prospects for preservation of an aeolian stratigraphic record in the basin fill.																					90-5410-597-6				1998							539	552																WOS:000073252100048
J	Yasuda, Y; Suzuki-Kamata, K				Yasuda, Y.; Suzuki-Kamata, K.			The origin of a coarse lithic breccia in the 34 ka caldera-forming Sounkyo eruption, Taisetsu volcano group, central Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The 34 ka Sounkyo eruption produced 7.6 km(3) of tephra (similar to 5 km(3) DRE) as fallout, ignimbrite, and lithic breccia units, forming a small, 2-km-diameter summit caldera in the Taisetsu volcano group, japan. The Sounkyo eruption products are made up of five eruptive units (SK-A to-E) in proximal regions, corresponding to the distal deposits, a 1- to 2-m-thick pumice fallout and the Px-type ignimbrite up to 220 m thick. The eruption began with a fallout phase, producing unstable low eruption columns during the earlier phase to form a <7-m-thick succession of well-stratified fallouts (5K-Al and the lower part of the distal fallout). The eruption column reached up to 25 km high (subplinian to plinian) and became more stable at the late of the phase, producing a < pumice-dominated fallout (SK-A2 and the upper part of the distal fallout). The second phase, the climax of the Sounkyo eruption, produced a widespread, valley-filling ignimbrite in both proximal and distal regions (SK-B and the N-type ignimbrite). At the end of the climactic phase, the waning of the eruption led to extensive failure of the walls of the shallow conduit, generating a dense, lithic-rich, low-mobile pyroclastic density current (PDC) to form a >27-m-thick, unstratified and ungraded, coarse lithic breccia (SK-C). The failure in turn choked the conduit, and then the eruption stopped. After a short eruptive hiatus, the eruption resumed with a short-lived fall phase, establishing an eruption column up to 16 km high and producing a <6-m-thick scoria fallout (SK-D). Finally, the eruption ended with the generation of PDCs by eruption column collapse to form a 5- to 15-m-thick ignimbrite in the proximal area (SK-E). Volume relationships between the caldera, ejected magma, and ejected lithic fragments suggest that the caldera was not essentially formed by caldera collapse but, instead, by vent widening as a consequence of explosive erosion and failure of the shallow conduit. The dominance of shallow-origin volcanic rocks in the lithic fraction throughout the Sounkyo eruption products implies the development of a flaring funnel-shaped vent. Hence, the occurrence of lithic breccias within small caldera-forming eruption products does not necessarily reflect either the existence or the timing of caldera collapse, as commonly assumed in literature. Lithic breccias commonly overlie climactic ignimbrite/fallout deposits in small caldera-forming eruptions, and an alternative explanation is that this reflects the collapse of the shallow conduit after an eruption climax, whose walls had been highly fractured and had become unstable owing to progressive erosion.

The source and evolution of paleofluids responsible for secondary minerals in low-permeability Ordovician limestones of the Michigan Basin	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In this study we report on the source and evolution of fluids associated with secondary vein and replacement minerals in low-permeability carbonate units in the Michigan Basin. This petrogenetic information was collected using thermometric data from fluid inclusions combined with C-, O- and Srisotope data, and focuses on mm-or cm-wide vein and vug minerals from Ordovician limestones of the Trenton and Black River groups and Cambrian sandstones in SW Ontario, Canada. Primary fluid inclusions in dolomite represent fluid stage I and have the highest trapping temperatures (T-trap) in the sedimentary succession, between 88 and 128 degrees C. Primary inclusions in calcite (stage II), and celestine and anhydrite (stage III), represent the final stages of secondary mineral formation and have Ttrap values of 54-78 degrees C. All three stages of vein minerals formed from brines with salinities of 31-37 wt % [CaCl2+NaCl](eq) that were saturated in halite and methane gas at the time of mineral growth. Three subsequent stages of secondary fluid inclusions were observed in the samples (stages IV-VI), however, no secondary vein minerals formed during these stages and they are interpreted as re-mobilization and/or minor fluid ingress along grain boundaries and micro-fractures. Notably, stage IV secondary inclusions are gas-undersaturated with salinities of 32-34 wt% [CaCl2+NaCl] eq and minimum Ttrap values of 57-106 degrees C, and are interpreted to have formed during a Late Devonian-Mississippian regional heating event. Secondary minerals from the Cambrian units and the Shadow Lake Formation have delta C-13 values of -6.1 to -2.5 parts per thousand (VPDB), delta O-18 values of +14.6 to +24.2 parts per thousand (VSMOW) and Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.70975-0.71043. Relative shifts of approximately +2 to +3 parts per thousand in delta C-13, > +4 parts per thousand in delta O-18 and -0.002 in Sr-87/Sr-86 are observed upward across the boundary between the CambrianeShadow Lake units and the overlying Gull River Formation. Samples from the Gull River and Coboconk formations and the Trenton Group (Kirkfield, Sherman Fall and Cobourg formations) have delta C-13 values of -1.0 to +1.9 parts per thousand, delta O-18 values of +18.9 to +28.1 parts per thousand and Sr-87/Sr-86 values of 0.70790-0.70990. The combined microthermometric and isotopic data for secondary minerals in the CambrianeShadow Lake units suggest they formed from hydrothermal brine with a geochemical signature obtained by interaction with the underlying Precambrian shield, or shield-derived minerals in the Cambrian sandstones. Previous U-Pb dating of vein calcite and Rb-Sr dating of secondary K-feldspar from the region suggests that brine ingress occurred during the Late OrdovicianeSilurian. The O-and Sr-isotope variability in vein samples from the Gull River and Coboconk formations is interpreted as localized mixing of O-18-enriched, connate fluids with hydrothermal brine. In comparison, isotopic data for the Trenton Group indicate secondary mineral formation from connate fluids, sourced from O-18-enriched, evolved seawater and/or modified hydrothermal brine that experienced fluiderock interaction during transit through the underlying stratigraphy.

J	MAHARA, Y; KUDO, A				MAHARA, Y; KUDO, A			PLUTONIUM RELEASED BY THE NAGASAKI A-BOMB - MOBILITY IN THE ENVIRONMENT	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES					1st International Symposium on Plutonium in the Environment	JUL 06-08, 1994	OTTAWA, CANADA	Int Comm Radionuclide Metrology				The first and second environmental releases of man-made Pu-239 + 240 came from nuclear explosions at Alamagordo and Nagasaki in 1945. The release at Nagasaki was more serious than at Alamagordo, because it happened in an area with a high population density. Unfissioned Pu-239 + 240 and various fission products (e.g. Sr-90 and Cs-137) have been interacting here with various environmental materials (soils, sediments, and plants) under wet and temperate conditions for more than 45 years. To assess the environmental mobility of Pu-239 + 240, the distributions of radionuclides from this release were investigated at Nishiyama (3 km east of the hypocenter) where heavy black rain containing unfissioned plutonium and fission products fell 30 minutes after the nuclear explosion. The vertical distributions of Sr-90, Cs-137 and Pu-239 + 240 were determined in unsaturated soil cores up to 450 cm deep. Most radionuclides were found in the soil column 30 cm from the ground surface (95% of Sr-90, 99% of Cs-137 and 97% of Pu-239 + 240). However, Sr-90 and Pu-239 + 240 were detected in the groundwater as well below a depth of 200 cm. No Cs-137 was found below 40 cm from the ground surface or in groundwater. These observations reveal that about 3% of the total Pu-239 + 240 has been migrating in the soil at a faster rate than the remaining Pu-239 + 240. Sharp peak of Cs-137 and Pu-239 + 240, indicating heavy deposition from the Nagasaki local fallout of 1945, were found in sediment cores collected from the Nishiyama reservoir. On the other hand, since Sr-90 is mobile in fresh water sediments, there was no 1945 Sr-90 peak in the sediment cores. Pu-239 + 240 peaks were unexpectedly discovered in pre-1945 sediment core sections. Although Sr-90 was found in these sections, no Cs-137 was found. By contrast to the distribution in sediment cores, Cs-137 in tree rings had spread by diffusion from the bark to the center of the tree without holding a fallout deposition record. Most of the Pu-239 + 240 was distributed in the tree rings following a similar deposition record to that found in sediment cores. Furthermore, a very small amount of Pu-239 + 240 (about 1%) was found unexpectedly in pre-1945 tree rings. The only reasonable explanation for these unexpected discoveries is the existence of mobile Pu-239 + 240 in the environment.																			0969-8043					NOV	1995	46	11					1191	1201		10.1016/0969-8043(95)00161-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0969-8043(95)00161-6													WOS:A1995TG27400013
J	Mineev, OY; Mineev, YN				Mineev, O. Y.; Mineev, Y. N.			Distribution of waterfowl of the Malozemelskaya tundra (Nenets autonomous district, Russia) among different wetland types	INLAND WATERS												Investigations were conducted between 1993 and 2005 in the Malozemelskaya tundra of Nenets autonomous district of the Arkhangelskaya region in Russia. The study site spanned the area along the Barents Sea from the saltwater Indigskaya Bay, across the saltwater Kolokolkova Bay, to the freshwater Korovinskaya Bay, and along the region's major rivers of the Malozemelskaya tundra. We divided the region into 6 different subregions and compared physical, biological, and chemical features of the lakes and ponds among the subregions, including number of waterfowl species and individuals by life stage (e.g., breeding and post-breeding), water surface area, spatial configuration of adjacent wetlands, water depth, pH, shoreline vegetation, and ratio of open water to vegetation. We used the information to categorize wetlands into 5 types and evaluated waterfowl use among the wetland types. The study area was strongly influenced by cryogenic processes with thermokarst formations with associated lakes and ponds of various ages, assessed by successional changes in vegetation. The hilly and hilly-ridge landscape of the area between the Urdjuzskoe lake subregion is dominanted by lakes of glacial and glacial cumulative origin. We also investigated waterfowl use within the saltwater-dominated Kolokolkova Bay, the freshwater Korovinskaya Bay, and within the Indiga, Neruta, and Velt river basins that bisect the region, and lastly wetlands of the Russkij Zavorot peninsula. We observed 42 species from 25 genera using about 72% of the wetland of the region. Thermokarst lakes had the greatest species diversity with 23 species observed. Glacial lakes and cumulative wetlands hosted the fewest species with 17 and 14 species, respectively. Oxbow lakes and lagoon lakes hosted 20 and 16 waterfowl species, respectively. We counted 20 species on saltwater Kolokolkova Bay and 19 on freshwater Korovinskaya Bay. The average number of species using any one of the 5 wetland types was 23. The greatest diversity of waterfowl species was observed on Rivers Neruta (22 species) and Velt (21 species) and in Pechora River Delta (17 species). During summer, species composition in river habitats was richer than in lakes.

J	Bourquin, S; Peron, S; Durand, M				Bourquin, Sylvie; Peron, Samuel; Durand, Marc			Lower Triassic sequence stratigraphy of the western part of the Germanic Basin (west of Black Forest): Fluvial system evolution through time and space	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The aim of this paper is to analyse the fluvial evolution of the Lower Triassic in the western part of the Germanic Basin through time and space, as well as the impact of the geodynamic and climatic setting on the preservation of fluvial deposits. The Lower Triassic crops out only in the Vosges Massif and the Black Forest, so well-log studies are required to realise sequence stratigraphy correlations and establish comparisons with others parts of the Germanic Basin. In a first step, we use well-log data analyses to characterise the electrofacies associations in the Triassic and then define the well-log signatures of each formation. In a second step, the characterisation and recognition of genetic sequences and their stacking pattern allow us to define seven minor cycles integrated into two major cycles. Finally, the quantification of the lithologies at different stages of basin evolution leads to the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental maps to illustrate facies evolution through space and time. A comparison with cycles defined in the Germanic Basin allows us to propose correlations of the Lower Triassic on either side of the Rhine Graben and leads to a discussion of the evolution of fluvial systems through time and space. During the Scythian, the fluvial style is characterised by braided fluvial systems evolving laterally into lake deposits towards the central part of the Germanic Basin. During this stage, the basin was a huge depression with very few marine connections in its extreme eastern part. The stratigraphic cycles represent rhythmic fluctuations in relative lake level that could be attributed to sediment supply and/or lake level variations in an and setting. Four minor stratigraphic cycles are observed that are integrated within a single major stratigraphic cycle. During the period of the stratigraphic base-level rise of the major cycle, a maximum of 233 m of sediment would represent a duration of sedimentation in the Paris Basin of at least 1.8 m.y. During the period of the stratigraphic base-level fall of the major cycle, a maximum of 65 m of sediment would have accumulated over 2.5 m.y. On the western edge of the Germanic Basin, the top of the Scythian is marked by a major sedimentary break characterised by a planation surface, with preservation of the first paleosols, followed by the Hardegsen unconformity. This unconformity is tectonically deformed, leading to the development of a new sedimentation area in the west of the basin. The fluvial sedimentation above this discontinuity shows a trend towards enhanced development of floodplain or lacustrine-type environments at its western margin, with the fort-nation of paleosols. The fluvial systems are linked with sabkhas, and then with a shallow sea connected to the Tethys Ocean. In this context, the stratigraphic cycles are caused by variations in relative sea level and/or sediment supply. The fluvial deposits are preserved in an exoreic basin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Barnes, S; Al-Chokhachy, R; Budy, P				Barnes, S.; Al-Chokhachy, R.; Budy, Phaedra			Impacts of lake elevation decline on spawning habitat of a critical native forage species	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective Lake elevation decline is a global phenomenon with pronounced effects in arid regions that changes the characteristics of nearshore habitat area available to lacustrine spawners, potentially impacting recruitment and whole-lake food web dynamics. Our objective was to understand the potential effects of lake elevation decline on spawning habitat for the Tui Chub Siphateles bicolor, a lacustrine spawner and critical component of the native food web in Pyramid Lake, Nevada.Methods We explored the distribution of ripe Tui Chub in nearshore habitat by associating habitat characteristics to ripe Tui Chub CPUE from a custom gill-net configuration, with data analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models. We then explored potential spawning habitat availability at all potential lake elevations using an elevation-explicit model of the basin that we developed based on several bathymetric and geospatial data sets and the knowledge of spawner distribution gained in the first component of the study.Results Ripe Tui Chub catch was primarily predicted by temperature, reaching a maximum between 14.2 degrees C and 24.8 degrees C found at less than 15 m of depth in Pyramid Lake throughout the summer spawning period. We estimated that with a contemporary decline in lake elevation of 8 m, Pyramid Lake will host the minimum area of spawning habitat based on morphometry alone at a 40% decrease from a theoretical maximum.Conclusions A decrease in lake elevation or an increase in lake temperatures-both of which are probable events based on future climate scenarios and estimates of water extraction upstream of Pyramid Lake-is likely to further restrict Tui Chub spawning habitat area. Our results have important implications for ecological water demand in Pyramid Lake and provide managers with information facilitating a science-based approach to managing the fish community. Water management and climate influence the surface elevation of lakes. We found that the quality and area of nearshore spawning habitat for a keystone fish, the Tui Chub, are impacted by water level fluctuations and warming trends.

Farmed charr are susceptible to infection with atypical Aeromonas salmonicida (aAS). Losses of valuable brood stock will severely reduce the genetic diversity of stocked charr. No commercial vaccines are available to prevent aAS infection, and vaccines against furunculosis (caused by typical A. salmonicida, tAS) do not protect the charr against aAS infection. The effects of a metabolizable oil-adjuvanted, bivalent vaccine (containing killed aAS and A. salmonicida salmonicida bacteria) on the immune system of 1 yr old hatchery-reared charr originating from Lake Inari in Northern Finland were examined. Fish vaccination in Finland generally takes place either from October to November or from February to April, when the water temperature is low (1 to 3degreesC). The water temperature starts to increase in mid-May. Therefore, we also investigated whether post-vaccination (p.v.) temperature had an influence on the immune system of this cold-water fish species, The fish were immunized intraperitoneally at 2.9degreesC at the end of April. After 52 d, during which the water temperature increased from 2.9 to 10.0degreesC, the charr were exposed to 1 of 3 test temperatures: 10.3, 14.1 or 18.1degreesC. Prior to vaccination, and 49, 75 and 103 d p.v., several immune parameters were measured in both unvaccinated and vaccinated charr. Vaccination induced a significant anti-aAS-specific antibody response, and increased plasma lysozyme activity at all p.v. temperatures. The haemolytic activity of the complement system was unaffected either by vaccination or p.v. temperatures. There was a slight positive correlation between p.v. temperature and lysozyme activity of the charr. The significant increase in lysozyme activity took place in vaccinated charr in the first 49 d p.v. as water temperatures increased from 2.9 to 10degreesC. Furthermore, the highest activity of lysozyme in the plasma was observed 49 d p.v. Our results indicate that a rise in water temperature above 10degreesC does not significantly enhance the vaccination response of charr. This could be one reason why farmed Arctic charr, which are well adapted to a cold climate, are highly susceptible to aAS infection in the summer.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				NOV 7	2002	52	1					47	55		10.3354/dao052047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao052047								12517005					WOS:000179693000006

Development of new global lake brGDGT-temperature calibrations: advances, applications, challenges, and recommendations	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are a group of temperature-sensitive membrane lipids found in bacteria that have been widely used in palaeo-temperature reconstruction. Despite recent advances in analytical methods, calibration datasets and statistical modelling approaches, one of the current challenges in Quaternary science remains in determining the most appropriate calibration model for reconstructing past changes in climate. We address this challenge by expanding existing calibration datasets, and by evaluating calibration models constructed using a range of statistical modelling approaches. We further evaluate model performance by applying the calibrations to published downcore records from contrasting environments and across different Quaternary timescales. Our study expands existing calibrations and includes new data from Antarctic lakes, providing greater confidence and applicability across a wider range of global environments. Results show robust brGDGT-temperature relationships on a global scale within the temperature range of approximately -2 degrees C to +31 degrees C covered in this study, with the random forest (RF) models performing the best (highest R2cv and lowest RMSEP) to estimate mean temperature of Months Above Freezing (MAF) and Mean Summer (air) Temperature (MST). Examination of uncertainties suggests the best models are accurately modelling all the features of the brGDGT-temperature relationships. To evaluate model performance downcore we apply and recommend a suite of exploratory statistical analyses to help identify core-samples that have unusual, no-analogue compositions, and use measures of correlation and concordance to summarise the similarity in trends and absolute values among reconstructions as a tool to suggest which reconstructions may be more reliable and where to use caution. Our results demonstrate that, although cross-validated calibration R2 cv and RMSEP may indicate good model performance for the calibration data, a thorough assessment is required to assess reconstruction reliability when a model is applied downcore at a specific site.

The Indian monsoon as a component of the climate system during the Holocene	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA					International Workshop on Indian Monsoon and Climate Variability During the Holocene	MAY 17-18, 2004	Bangalore, INDIA	Geol Soc India				The Indian summer monsoon is fundamentally a giant land-sea breeze produced by the heating of the Eurasian land mass and the relative cooling of the Indian Ocean. It is a significant component of the climate system as it has global linkages through El Nino-Southem Oscillation (ENSO) and other factors. Changes in the land-ocean temperature contrast can have a profound influence on the strength of the monsoon winds and precipitation. Although India is fortunate to have instrumental records of rainfall dating back to. the 18(th) century, it is important to investigate how on geological time scales, the monsoon may have responded to variations in the incoming solar energy, the earth's orbital characteristics and glacial boundary conditions. For reconstructing past monsoon episodes, recourse has to be taken to proxy data as indirect evidence of what the conditions might have been like. There are many high-resolution proxy indicators such as width and density of tree rings in the Himalayan forests, geochemical characteristics of Arabian Sea corals, laminated ocean-floor sediment cores off the west coast of India, lake-bed pollen sequences from northwestern India, and high-elevation ice cores from the Tibetan region. It must be realised that inferences drawn from proxy studies are bound to have limitations and uncertainties and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of analyses carried out with recent meteorological data. However, for studies on time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, there is perhaps no alternative to the use of proxy data. It is now generally agreed that the climate of the Holocene was relatively stable, but was characterised by millennial scale variability and long-term trends including changes in the nature of ENSO. As more results emerge from proxy studies, we would be in a better position to re-construct past monsoons, droughts and floods over the Indian region. If parallels to the present global warming trend were discovered in the historical past, they would help in building better monsoon prediction models.																			0016-7622	0974-6889				SEP	2006	68	3					347	352																WOS:000242675200003

This study provides an attempt to investigate how carbon sequestration in mountain lakes responds to seismic activities, extreme climate events and human disturbance. The new data of grain-size end members (EMs), TN contents, C/N, concentrations of algal spores, and P and Mn contents, in addition to previously published data of TOC and Ca contents, Zr/Rb, Rb/Sr, and land-pollen assemblages of a well-dated sediment core from Yileimu Lake, depicted a more detailed history of environmental evolution in the region. A great earthquake happened in southern Altay at similar to 3500 cal yr BP that triggered extensive landslides around the lake, and then frequent floods eroded the catchment between similar to 3500 and 2300 cal yr BP, subsequently severe drought events occurred within the period of 2300-1000 cal yr BP, finally agricultural and pastoral activities intensified within the last 1000 yrs. Organic carbon accumulation rate (OCAR) in Yileimu Lake was extremely high (an underestimated value of similar to 370 g m(-2) yr(-1)) during the earthquake event, in response to the rapid accumulation of landslide materials. Regional comparison revealed that summer temperature was unexpected to have determined the OCAR during both flood and drought events (average 4.07 and 3.64 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively), because it dominated the production of land- and aquatic plants. Human activities increased the OCAR prominently (averages 6.26 g m(-2) yr(-1)) via changing sediment production and vegetation planting, which decoupled the OCAR from climate factors. These data imply that carbon sequestration in lakes from mountain areas where temperature adversity stress dominated vegetation growth would have the potential to increase under anthropogenic warming. In addition, seismically induced carbon sequestration in lakes from tectonically active regions cannot be ignored.

The Khmilnyk structural and tectonic unit and its geological and geophysical essence	GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL												The Khmilnyk structural and tectonic node is an extraordinary case for the Ukrainian Shield. It is located in its southwestern part (Berdychiv Uplift), at the intersection of three deep faults, and is a clearly manifested deep-penetrating section of the crystalline basement (thermoblast). Its conditional length from west to east is about 40 km, and the epicenter falls on the Khmilnyk gravity minimum with dimensions of 25x25 km and relative intensity of-16 mGal, which coincides with the area of reduced magnetic field intensity. According to a comprehensive geological and geophysical interpretation of these data, the nature of the minimum is due to the manifestation of a local center of Proterozoic acid magmatism among the granitoids of the Berdychiv complex, represented by a mushroom-shaped massif of garnet leucogranites of a biotite composition, traced to a depth of 15 km, i.e., to the zone of existence of a possible granite melt. The mushroom shape of the granitoids, whose density is 0.1 g/cm(3) less than that of Berdychiv granites, is explained by subhorizontal penetration of the melt in the near-surface part of the crust in the form of sills. Magmatic activity within the massif and in the area of its endo-exocontacts is accompanied by deep degassing in the form of radon emanations and manifestations of uranium mineralization. The area of the entire Khmilnyk structural and tectonic unit is characterized by numerous manifestations of dike gabbro-diabase Proterozoic magmatism, contrasting halos of indicator minerals of kimberlites and diamond fragments in the sedimentary cover. Detailed petrologic and geochemical characteristics of garnets in general and pyropes in particular are presented. It is shown that the garnets of the study area are of crustal-mantle origin. Some are identical in chemical composition and colorimetric parameters to the garnets of diamond-bearing bimineraleclogites from kimberlites of diamond-bearing provinces of the world. The pyrope is dominated by orange garnets, which indicates a high content of eclogite association varieties. More than a dozen pyrope halos have been identified, lesson smaller than the pyrope halo of the world-famous Snap-Lake deposit (Canadian Shield). The noted geological and geophysical factors and significant permeability of the crystalline foundation of the node provide important arguments for its classification as a first-stage area for prospecting for possible indigenous sources of diamonds of basiteultrabasite, including kimberlite-lamproitemagmatism, within the Berdychiv Uplift.

A Geostatistics-Based Tool to Characterize Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Fields Over the Contiguous United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Surface fluxes and states can recur and remain consistent across various spatial and temporal scales, forming space-time patterns. Quantifying and understanding the observed patterns is desirable, as they provide information about the dynamics of the processes involved. This study introduces the empirical spatio-temporal covariance function and a corresponding parametric covariance function as tools to identify and characterize spatio-temporal patterns in remotely sensed fields. The method is demonstrated using 2 km hourly GOES-16/17 land surface temperature (LST) data over the Contiguous United States by splitting the area into 1.0 degrees x 1.0 degrees domains. The summer day-time LST ESTCFs for 2018 to 2022 are derived for each domain, and a parametric covariance model is fitted. Clustering analysis is applied to detect areas with similar spatio-temporal LST patterns. Six main zones within CONUS are identified and characterized based on their variance and temporal and spatial characteristic length scales (i.e., scales for which the temperature variations are temporally and spatially related), respectively: (a) Eastern plains with 3 K-2, similar to 6 hr, and 0.15 degrees, (b) Gulf of California with 60 K-2, similar to 8 hr, and 0.34 degrees, (c) mountains and coasts transition 1 with 16 K-2, similar to 11 hr, and 0.25 degrees, (d) central US, Midwest, and South cities with 5.5 K-2, similar to 8 hr, and similar to 0.2 degrees, (e) mountains and coasts transition 2 with similar to 10 K-2, similar to 8 hr, and 0.2 degrees, and (f) largest mountains and coastlines with similar to 19 K-2, similar to 13 hr, and 0.3 degrees. The tools introduced provide a pathway to formally identify and summarize the spatio-temporal patterns observed in remotely sensed fields and relate those to more complex processes within the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere System.

We used a lacustrine sedimentary profile (BG-2019) from Lake Baiyangdian, in the hinterland of the North China Plain, to quantitatively reconstruct temperature changes during the MLHT, using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). We then integrated this record with selected quantitative paleotemperature records from North China to explore the effects of temperature change on the evolution of Neolithic cultures in this region. The results show that the mean annual temperature (MAT) in the hinterland of the North China Plain during the MLHT averaged similar to 15.7 degrees C (similar to 3.6 degrees C higher than today); and that three significant cooling events occurred (the 5.3 ka event, 4.8 ka event, and 4.2 ka event), at similar to 5300-5100 cal yr BP, 4800 cal yr BP, and similar to 4500-4300 cal yr BP, respectively, with cooling between -2.1 degrees C and -3.4 degrees C. Integration of our results with other regional quantitative paleotemperature records shows that these three cooling events are well documented in North China, with spatial consistency in their magnitude and onset of cooling. These cooling events are temporally correlated to two cultural transitions in North China: the cooling event at similar to 5300-4800 cal yr BP corresponds to the decline of the Yangshao culture in the Central Plains region, and the decline of the Hongshan culture in the Yanliao region, which evolved into the Xiaoheyan culture. Additionally, we suggest that the cooling event at similar to 5300-4800 cal yr BP, combined with the weakening of the summer monsoon, contributed to the end of the Yangshao culture and the rise of the Longshan culture in the Central Plains region, and that it accelerated the end of the Xiaoheyan culture and the rise of the Xiajiadian Lower Culture in the Yanliao region.

J	Korytny, LM				Korytny, L. M.			A Geographic Approach to Water Sciences	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This work considers Water Science as one single bloc. It has been proved that geography as the only science that studies the complete nature-economy-population system within its disciplines can serve as a basis for improving integral and sectoral methodology. Five main functions of water have been identified, such as, vital, energy-producing, environment-forming, water-area, and civilizational. Five major problems have been revealed, which result from using water bodies and water resources: depletion of water resources, leading to a quantitative water shortage; contamination of water bodies, leading to their qualitative degradation; changes in the water regime and water balance of terrestrial landscapes and water bodies due to anthropogenic activities that lead to disruption of the circulation of moisture, climate change, and changes in aquatic biogeocenoses; problems that arise from cross-sectoral trade-offs, as well as from uneven spatial distribution of water resources, different rates and stages of economic growth and levels of socio-economic development; and hazardous natural phenomena and disasters. The gaps are examined that emerge in the absence of geographic thinking in surface-water hydrology, including the case of determining the maximum (peak) discharge in the catastrophic flood in the summer of 2019 on the Iya River in the city of Tulun and an unsatisfactory governmental attempt to maintain the level of Lake Baikal within a one-meter level. An analysis is performed of the geographic direction in the Water Sciences. The paper reports the results of the studies of the Siberian landscape-hydrological school, whose landmark issue is associated with the book by A.N. Antipov and L.M. Korytny Geographic Aspects of Hydrological Research: Case Study of the River Systems of the Southern Minusinsk Depression published 40 years ago. The experimental-landscape, geosystem-regional (basin), indicational, cartographic, classification, and organizational and coordinating directions were defined as the principals for this school. The study proposes the main ways for solving the problems of strengthening the geographic approach to the Water Sciences.

J	Munroe, JS				Munroe, Jeffrey S.			Late-Holocene hydroclimate inferences for the northern Great Basin from Little Lake, Elko County, Nevada, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Prominent lunette dunes 500-800 m long, 50-80 m wide, and up to 5 m tall are present on the floor of the Independence Valley in northeast Nevada, USA. These dunes border the downwind margins of circular playas at the end of a drainage descending from the East Humboldt Mountains, which terminates in an ephemeral water body named Little Lake. Gastropod shells from the Little Lake playa yield radiocarbon ages of similar to 400 cal yr BP, after correction for a hard-water effect. A similar age was obtained for shells from the crest of one of the lunettes. Deeper sediment in this lunette yielded shell ages clustering around 600 cal yr BP. This pattern suggests two intervals of relatively persistent water at Little Lake, both of which ended with lake desiccation and deflation of sediment and shells to the adjacent lunette. Shells from the crest of another lunette yielded radiocarbon ages between 3800 and 1750 cal yr BP. This dune, therefore, is considerably older and accumulated over a much longer stretch of time. Using the Global Surface Water Explorer, years between 1984 and 2018 were identified in which Little Lake contained water in most of the available summer imagery. These years form three clusters: 1984-1987, 1997-2000, and 2017-2018. Snow water equivalent (SWE) is greater in the mountains, snow makes up a greater percent of total annual precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index is more positive in this region, in years when water is present in Little Lake compared with those in which the lake remains dry. Values of the PDO are also higher in years when Little Lake holds water. Although the hydrology of Little Lake may be influenced to an unknown degree by upstream water diversions, this overall pattern implies that the lake and its associated lunettes are a sensitive recorder of late Holocene hydroclimate variability in the northern Great Basin.

However, debates persist regarding the factors influencing delta 13Corg values and their sensitivity to lake level fluctuations. This study systematically evaluated the factors contributing to delta 13Corg variations and assessed the reliability of delta 13Corg as a proxy for lake level, utilizing sediments from Hurleg Lake on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau as a case study. Initially, we analyzed the delta 13Corg of surface lake sediments, aquatic plants, and terrestrial plants samples, and compared them with the delta 13Corg in the sediment core of HL18-3. Combing with the compound-specific n-alkanes isotopes, Paq and C/N ranges, the results demonstrated that the organic matter (OM) source in Hurleg Lake was dominated by both aquatic and terrestrial plants. Further analysis of the relationship between delta 13Corg and established lake level indicators revealed that delta 13Corg in lake sediments was capable of signifying changes in lake level, reflecting variabilities of the regional effective humidity. Our study distinguishes itself from previous research by identifying that the negative delta 13Corg values from C3 plants substantially contribute to the depletion of delta 13Corg of lake sediments. Ultimately, we reconstructed the lake level history since 14.1 cal kyr BP, and reviewed the general lake level variations on the northeastern TP. The results indicated that the lake level fluctuations on the northeastern TP have exhibited a relatively consistent pattern since the termination of the Last Deglacial. A typical high lake level on the northeastern TP occurred during the late Holocene, which was induced by enhanced Westerly. Collectively, the source and intensity of water input, along with regional temperature and evaporation changes, are pivotal factors affecting changes in lake level fluctuations.

J	Lees, JA; Flower, RJ; Ryves, D; Vologina, E; Sturm, M				Lees, JA; Flower, RJ; Ryves, D; Vologina, E; Sturm, M			Identifying sedimentation patterns in Lake Baikal using whole core and surface scanning magnetic susceptibility	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Forty seven ca. 1 m sediment cores were collected from Lake Baikal during a summer cruise in 1996 and analysed for whole-core susceptibility. Fifteen of these cores were further analysed using a new prototype surface scanning sensor on board the ship R.V. Vereshchagin. The main purpose of this paper is to show that the measurement of Lake Baikal short cores using two susceptibility sensors gives valuable field data and can be used as a tool for identifying undisturbed sediment sequences. Four coring transects were sampled to identify sedimentation patterns reaching from the shelves and sub-basins of the near lake shore and across mainly the northern basin of Lake Baikal (water depth ca. 1500 m). Also in the sub-basins and in the southern basin other groups of cores were taken. One of the main sediment features of interest is that of turbidite sedimentation. Whole core magnetic susceptibility traces are used to identify turbidite 'fingerprints' and correlate them between cores along the transects. The results from the two magnetic susceptibility sensors the whole-core sensor and the new prototype surface scanning sensor, both giving volume Kappa values, are compared and are found to be significantly correlated given the difference in resolution. The whole-core sensor gives a smoothed equivalent to a 'moving average' curve of magnetic susceptibility while the surface scanner can give fine resolution (ca. 2 mm) results picking out fine peaks with Kappa values of between 150 to 650. The results show that most turbidite sedimentation can be clearly identified; they give a specific magnetic susceptibility 'fingerprint' with larger Kappa values (up to 120) at the base of the turbidite corresponding with the settling of coarser sandy sediments and a steady and gradual decline in values to about 15 at the top of the turbidite where the fines settle incorporating the normal diatomaceous sedimentation. The main control on the magnetic susceptibility of the turbidite sediments is the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals in different particle size fractions. The turbidites can be correlated between many of the cores collected along the transects but it must be noted that these correlations are partly speculative and will be confirmed with future dating, diatom analysis and geochemistry. Other very fine peaks of less than 5 mm in width identified using the surface scanning sensor may indicate concentrations of ferrimagnetic minerals, namely greigite, formed during the reduction phase.

At present this is a tectonically quiet region without large seismic events. But it is well known that in post-glacial time the Fennoscandian shield was an arena of active postglacial tectonics and large earthquakes. The evidence for such events was found in various parts of Fennoscandia. The traces left by some paleoearthquakes show an undisputed character of large post-glacial faults some tens of kilometres long and of a few meters in displacement. However, some other features left by earthquakes are under discussion. Numerous deformations in bedrock and in soft sediments which can be considered as being due to earthquakes were found in the Russian Karelia. Interpretation of some of these deformation structures can lead to different conclusions about their origin, for example, weathering, cryogenic, glacial, and gravitational factors. One possible way to overcome these difficulties is an integrated study of different types of deformations at key sites, comparison of these with each other and with the tectonic features of the region, and the search for common structural and kinematic features. Another problem is the estimation of parameters of paleo-earthquakes. This problem includes the determinations of their location, intensities, magnitudes, and age. The key site under study is located in the northern part of the Karelian Isthmus in the re-activated (during post-glacial time) tectonic zone (the Vuoksi Fault Zone), whose signature in the relief is seen in the form of the straight-line valley of the Vuoksi River. We studied different types of post-glacial seismogenic deformations at this locality. There are seismically induced gravitational and vibrational deformations in solid rock, as well as folds and ruptures in loose sediments. The key site of large deformation examined here includes three zones: 1) the main zone of deformations or the Central Fractured Massif (CFM); 2) the seismically induced colluvial zone; 3) the outer zone of deformations in loose sediments. We have established that all types of deformations are kinematically similar in the CFM and around it (at distances of a few kilometres). A detailed examination of deformations and their spatial and temporal relationships allows us to distinguish three generations of earthquake-induced deformations: 1) Late Glacial, 2) Early Holocene, and 3) Middle to Late Holocene. We estimate the intensities of the respective earthquakes as I=IX, IX, and VII-VIII. Clearly, the intensities decrease from post-glacial to present time, but the recent level of seismicity is unclear and may be much higher than hypothesized. In addition, the evidence for shear kinematics of the fault shows that earthquakes were not only caused by post-glacial rebound, but also resulted from a different tectonic mechanism possibly related to plate tectonics.

Rising temperatures and increased nutrient levels are causing eutrophication and deoxygenation, harming freshwater resources and the essential ecosystem services they provide. While modern impacts are well studied, knowledge on the responses of lake ecosystems to climate change in pre-anthropogenic times is still sparse. Current studies often rely on models or short observation time series, making it challenging to isolate the effects of warming from other factors. Lake sediments provide long-term records to study these effects in times prior to anthropogenic impact.We investigate the responses of aquatic primary production, lake stratification, and deoxygenation to rapid climate change during the Late Glacial (18-11 kacalBP) using hyperspectral imaging, pigment extractions, XRF, and sequential extraction of redox-sensitive P, Mn, and Fe in a small kettle hole lake (Amsoldingersee, Switzerland).Our record reveals that ice cover was the primary driver of hypolimnetic anoxia, while the availability of nutrients determined the composition of algal communities. Four anoxic phases occurred in cold periods with prolonged ice cover: (i) Heinrich 1 (ca. 16.1 kacalBP), (ii) the Aegelsee Oscillation, (iii) the Gerzensee Oscillation, and (iv) the Younger Dryas. Aquatic primary production and algal communities already responded to initial relatively weak warming during Heinrich 1 (16.1 kacalBP) long before the rapid B & oslash;lling warming and synchronously to rapid climatic changes during Late Glacial times. Responses of the algal community to temperature were strongly modulated by nutrient limitations (P, N, and Si), which have varying importance over time, with dust and volcanic tephra (Laacher See) being major nutrient sources. Anoxic phases changed the algal communities, but these shifts were found to be reversible once the anoxia disappeared. Further, the sediments of Amsoldingersee provide a continuous record of atmospheric dust deposition (Ti, Zr, Si) covering the entire Late Glacial period. The similarity with the NGRIP dust record supports the view that the same large-scale atmospheric circulation regime controlled central Europe (Switzerland) and Greenland.

Previous studies suggest that suitable BHC habitat is limited to a few productive, nearshore areas. However, those studies did not consider the influence of BHC's diet plasticity or the presence of spatially-discrete subsurface prey resources. This study aimed to characterise Lake Michigan's suitability for BHC and evaluate the importance of these considerations in habitat suitability assessments. We used simulated outputs of prey biomass (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detritus) and water temperature from a three-dimensional biophysical model of Lake Michigan to evaluate growth rate potential (GRP, quantitative index of habitat suitability) of adult BHC throughout the entire volume of the lake. Our GRP model applied a foraging model and a bioenergetics model to translate prey concentrations and water temperatures into habitat quality indexed by individual fish growth rate. We defined suitable habitat as habitats that can support GRP >= 0 g g(-1) day(-1). We developed six feeding scenarios to evaluate the impact of diet flexibility and subsurface prey resources on suitable habitat quantity. Scenarios were defined by the number of prey types the fish could consume and the depths at which they could feed (surface or whole water column). Consistent with previous studies, we found that habitats with the highest quality were concentrated near river mouths and in eutrophic areas of Green Bay. However, in contrast to previous studies, we found suitable offshore habitat for bighead carp owing to our added considerations of diet plasticity and subsurface prey resources. For silver carp, these considerations extended suitable habitat within Green Bay and in some tributary-influenced nearshore areas, but offshore areas remained predominantly unsuitable in all feeding scenarios. Differences in simulated habitat suitability between these two species probably reflect differences in energy density and mass of the specific fishes we used in our model. However, reports of these two species in environments where they coexist indicate that bighead carp grow at faster rates than silver carp, as our model simulated. Our vertical analysis at Muskegon, MI, U.S.A. indicates that subsurface temperature and prey biomass are not only sufficient to support bighead carp growth but provide maximum habitat quality during late summer stratification. Overall, our study demonstrates that BHC are capable of surviving and growing in much larger areas of Lake Michigan than predicted by previous studies, and thus suggests that the risk of establishment is not sufficiently reduced by low plankton concentrations. Maps generated by our model identified the potential for cross-lake migration corridors that may facilitate and accelerate lake-wide movements. We believe these maps could be used to prioritise surveillance protocols by identifying areas to which BHC might spread upon entering the lake. More broadly, this research demonstrates how the physiology and trophic ecology of BHC contributes to their high invasive capacity and can permit their survival in novel environments.					; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020; Su, Zhenming/G-2857-2011	Su, Zhenming/0000-0002-0587-1847; Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346; Alsip, Peter/0000-0002-9830-914X													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2019	64	11					1921	1939		10.1111/fwb.13382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13382													WOS:000490904700004
J	Jara, IA; Lampe-Huenul, N				Jara, Ignacio A.; Lampe-Huenul, Nicolas			The last 21,000 years of climate evolution in the South American Altiplano based on the CHELSA-TraCE21k transient simulation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Climate model simulations have improved their skills in reconstructing some of the major climatic and environmental transformations since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, their validation against proxy data is still a critical step for assessing potential biases and misrepresentations. Here we present a detailed analysis of the CHELSA-TraCE21k dataset (Karger et al., 2023), a statistical downscaling of the TraCE21k global transient simulation, focusing on the South American Altiplano (14-22 degrees S). We validated the model skill in reconstructing temperatures and precipitation in this high-Andean environment using both present-day and proxy data. We then discuss the simulation in the light of regional reconstructions to provide an updated view of the paleoclimate evolution in the Altiplano over the last 21,000 years. The simulation shows an average LGM temperature decrease of 3.4 degrees C with a slight precipitation increase, and reveals two humid phases between 17.5-15 and 12.8-11.7 ka BP. Holocene conditions were relatively warm and dry, with slow but persistent warming and drying between 11 and 5 ka BP. The CHELSA-TraCE21k dataset shows an overall good agreement with proxy records, indicating that the small-scale orography effects included in the downscaling algorithm improve the representation of past surface conditions relative to original global simulation. There are differences between the model and proxy data in the extent of paleo-glaciers and the amplitude of temperature and precipitation changes. The simulation reveals that the climate history of the Altiplano during the last deglaciation was forced by changes in austral summer insolation, superimposed by millennial-scale climate events in the Northern Hemisphere. The spatial distribution of hydroclimate anomalies suggests that the formation of the large paleolakes was aided by the overflow of Lago Titicaca. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the Altiplano's paleoclimate evolution and highlight the value of integrating both proxy and modelling data.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				SEP 1	2025	363								109414	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109414													WOS:001501855700001
J	Luhr, JF				Luhr, JF			The geology and petrology of Volcan San Juan (Nayarit, Mexico) and the compositionally zoned Tepic Pumice	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Volcan San Juan is the westernmost Quaternary composite volcano in the Mexican Volcanic Belt. Its activity is divided into three stages of decreasing eruptive volume. During stage-1 activity, the main cone of San Juan and the adjacent Cerro Alto grew to a combined volume of similar to 60 km(3) through eruption of hornblende-bearing andesites, dacites, and rhyodacites. Stage 1 included explosive eruptions of hornblende-dacite and an andesite dated at 33,750 a (years ago) and 23,010 a. Stage-2 activity involved a major Plinian eruption 14,770 a that produced the hypersthene-hornblende-bearing, compositionally zoned, rhyodacitic-andesitic Tepic Pumice and led to formation of an oval-shaped caldera 4 x 1 km in diameter. Tepic, the capital city of Nayarit State, with a population of similar to 250,000, lies at the NE foot of Volcan San Juan. This location was buried under 2-9 m of rhyodacitic pumice-fall deposits from the Tepic Pumice eruption. Erosion has since removed virtually all exposures of Tepic Pumice > 15 km from the caldera. The estimated volume of erupted tephra is 5.6 km(3), equivalent to 1.2 km(3) of magma. modeling of the eruption dynamics indicates that as the eruption evolved the column height increased from similar to 15 km to similar to 24 km and maximum mass discharge rate increased from similar to 3 x 10(6) kg/s to similar to 6 x 10(7) kg/s. During stage-3 activity, a hornblende-andesitic lava dome partially filled the caldera and sent block lava flows down the north slope of thr cone; total erupted volume was similar to 0.55 km(3). Compared to other composite volcanoes of the western Mexican Volcanic Belt, the products from San Juan have the highest Sr contents and the lowest Rb, Y, Yb, and Lu contents, resulting in high La/Yb and Sr/Y, with low: Rb/Sr. These observations indicate a strong slab-melt component at San Juan, consistent with its proximity to thr Middle America Trench where young, hot lithosphere is subducting The San Juan andesites, dacites, and rhyodacites also have relatively high Sr-87/Sr-86, Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204, and low epsilon(Nd) values compared to these other volcanoes, which appear to reflect significant crustal contamination of San Juan's magmas.

J	Kubera, L; Rolbiecki, D; Harnisz, M; Kotlarska, E; Perlinski, P				Kubera, Lukasz; Rolbiecki, Damian; Harnisz, Monika; Kotlarska, Ewa; Perlinski, Piotr			The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant fecal bacteria in recreational aquatic environments: Phenotypic and molecular approach	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The rising incidence of antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to public health. In recent years the widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in the concentration of antibiotic-resistant bacteria also in natural environments. The study was conducted in bathing areas three recreational lakes located in the Zaborski Landscape Park in northern Poland. Water samples were collected in three parallel repetitions in April, June and September 2022. Our study indicates that anthropopressure connected with tourism and recreation promotes the growth of fecal bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, whose significant accumulation was recorded in September, the month marking the end of summer vacation. Antibiotic resistance profiles showed that isolated strains of fecal bacteria were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The highest percentage of Escherichia coli strains showed resistance to cefepime (39.1%), and enterococci to imipenem (26.9%). The amplification of resistance genes confirmed the presence of only selected bla genes in the examined strains of fecal bacteria. The blaTEM gene was found in 14 strains of Enterococcus faecium (82.4%), in all 4 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, and in 4 out of 5 unspecified strains of fecal streptococci. In Escherichia coli only blaCTX gene was identified in one strain. The presence of blaTEM genes was strongly correlated with the concentration of fecal bacteria, it can therefore be assumed that the presence of resistance genes was caused by direct contamination of the studied lakes with feces containing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, presumably without contamination from other sources. Resistance genes found in the control strains from sewage treatment plants were not identified in the studied isolates. Antibiotic resistance genetic markers found in strains isolated from wastewater may prove helpful in determining the sources of contamination of natural aquatic ecosystems with antibiotic-resistant fecal bacteria and thus ensure efficient management of projects aimed at making these waterbodies available for public use.

Abiotic and biotic factors related to growth of nonnative Walleyes in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveUnderstanding factors influencing growth is vital to effective management of fish populations. This study investigated potential factors influencing growth of an established nonnative population of Walleyes Sander vitreus in the Lake Pend Oreille system in northern Idaho.MethodsWe used relative growth index to describe growth of Walleyes relative to populations across North America. Mixed-effects modeling was used to relate growth to abiotic (i.e., mean summer water temperature, river inflow) and biotic (i.e., kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka abundance and biomass; opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana density) variables. Models were ranked using Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size. Individual variability in growth was related to diet represented by stable isotopes (i.e., delta 15N, delta 13C) using linear regression for age-1, age-2, age-3, and age-5 individuals. Subsequently, for each age-class, we evaluated differences in delta 15N and delta 13C between fast-growing (i.e., 75th and higher percentiles of growth) and slow-growing (i.e., 25th and lower percentiles of growth) individuals.ResultWalleyes grew fast relative to other populations. Growth of Walleyes was positively associated with temperature as well as abundance and biomass of kokanee; growth was unrelated to river inflow and opposum shrimp density. The top model indicated that growth of Walleyes was related to temperature and kokanee abundance. An equally plausible model explaining growth consisted of only temperature. Generally, fast-growing Walleyes exhibited higher delta 15N than slow-growing individuals. Similarly, delta 13C was more depleted in the fast-growing individuals for all ages except age 1. This suggests that fast-growing individuals likely consumed prey items at higher trophic positions and fast-growing Walleyes (except age 1) used higher proportions of pelagic prey items.ConclusionThis study showed that kokanee abundance and temperature likely influenced growth of Walleyes in the Lake Pend Oreille system. Additionally, variability in growth was apparently related to variability in diet, particularly for age-1 Walleyes.					; Corsi, Matthew/AAK-8502-2021	Corsi, Matthew/0000-0002-9616-3466; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2024	44	6					1325	1341		10.1002/nafm.11056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.11056		DEC 2024											WOS:001378041300001

Climatic evolution in the Australian region over the last 94 ka - spanning human occupancy -, and unveiling the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Quaternary is well known for being a period of the geological record that saw significant and alternating climatic fluctuations. Here, we concentrate on the last 94 millennia that saw Australia and its surrounding seas undergo significant environmental changes. Importantly also it is during that this period of time includes the arrival and settlement of humans in Australia. Following on from Marine Isotopic Stage 4 (MIS4) that saw, over the period of 71-59 ka BP, a significant eustatic sea level drop (similar to 100 m), low sea-surface temperatures as well as glacial conditions on land, Australia experienced wet conditions again, but eventually progressively entered into a glacial phase. By then, humans had arrived on this large continent and later the megafauna progressively became extinct. This paper describes in detail the climate over this period, based principally on the high-resolution record of two marine sediment cores located offshore of the southern Australian margin, and that are then compared with known events on land as well as other deep-sea cores. Particular emphasis is placed on the period that spans the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the extent of which thus far had been poorly defined in the Australian region. Emphasis is placed on the period from 34 to 14 ka to demonstrate that (1) the LGM, defined here as the period 24 to 18 ka, was not always extremely dry and cold, and (2) that people were able to live in inland Australia as water existed in places, despite generally cold conditions. We also show using a series of ten maps-at 2 ka intervals over the 34-14 ka period-the waxing and waning of oceanic fronts such as the Subtropical and Subantarctic Fronts, link sea-surface temperatures (SST) with periods of glacial expansion in the Australian Alps and Tasmania, as well as the South Island of New Zealand, and the extent of the Leeuwin Current down to south of Australia. Aeolian dust was transported at sea over the main core site from similar to 26 to 18 ka period, pointing to arid conditions in Australia, but this period was punctuated by two significant reductions in dust transport to both core sites, coinciding with a retreat of the Subantarctic Front away from the Australian southern coastline, and slight SST shifts for a few centuries at similar to 24 and 22-21 ka BP. At the peak of the cold phase, from 23 to 18.4 ka, summer SST were of the order of 9 degrees C below that experienced during the middle of the Holocene at about 6 ka BP. A similar temperature drop was also experienced offshore the northwestern corner of Western Australia. Periglacial activity dates for the Australian mainland and Tasmania pool around similar to 22 ka. On either side of the 24 ka event, the chain of lakes in the Willandra Lakes retained water and human activity was registered in the area. Elsewhere in Australia, water was present to sustain human populations during the cold and dry times. It is postulated here that northern Australia was at times quite wet, especially during MIS4. The cessation of the LGM is set on 18.4 ka from offshore southern Australia as confirmed for the deepsea cores by several proxies, and more likely at 18 ka inland. Finally, we document that it took two millennia for "glacial" conditions to end in the Australian region as registered in our deep-sea core records, well after the lowest global sea level similar to 20.6 and 20 ka, respectively, started to rise. There is also evidence of another very cold period determined on the Australian mainland, Tasmania and the South Island of New Zealand centred around 27 ka, after which time warmer conditions occurred before the start of the LGM. This is matched with our deep-sea records with very cold conditions and changes in oceanographic conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	BROWN, KM; RICHARDSON, TD				BROWN, KM; RICHARDSON, TD			PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN THE LIFE HISTORIES AND PRODUCTION OF 2 WARM-TEMPERATE VIVIPARID PROSOBRANCHS	VELIGER												Although prosobranch gastropods are common in southeastern rivers, little is known of the degree of phenotypic plasticity that occurs in their life histories and production ecology. We therefore studied cohort dynamics, life-history variation and secondary production in two viviparid prosobranchs at two sites in southern Louisiana. Bayou Manchac (BM), a slow-flowing flood-plain river, had levels of coarse and fine particulate organic material (potential food resources) twelve and six times greater, respectively, than did Old River (OR), an ox-bow lake, but also had lower average water temperatures, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, and water hardness. Considerable phenotypic plasticity in life historics and production occurred in both species. Viviparus subpurpureus (Say, 1829) dies after reproducing at an age of two years at BM, but grows more rapidly, reaches greater individual sizes, and reproduces and dies after only one year at OR. Campeloma decisum (Say, 1816) females reproduce at an age of two years, and then reproduce again and dic at an age of three years at BM, but also grow more rapidly, reach larger shell lengths, and have an annual life-history pattern at OR. Females of both species at any given size brood more young at BM, but average clutch size is similar because females reach larger shell lengths at OR. Both species reached densities on the average four times higher at BM, resulting in higher annual standing stocks and greater annual production. Annual turnover rates, however, were two times greater at OR because of shorter development times and life cycles. Both snail species were found in deeper water at BM (with lower levels of dissolved oxygen) than at OR, suggesting that these snails are well adapted to hypoxia. When sub-adults of V. subpurpureus from both sources were reared at BM, differences in growth rates and numbers of embryos brooded disappeared, indicating that this intraspecific life-history variation is eco-phenotypic. We suggest that high levels of food resources at BM may promote greater fecundity, population density, and secondary production, but that lower temperatures and dissolved oxygen levels at the same habitat during summer may limit individual growth and result in longer life cycles in both species.

J	Doublet, S; Garcia, JP				Doublet, S; Garcia, JP			The significance of dropstones in a tropical lacustrine setting, eastern Cameros Basin (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, Spain)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Outsized clasts (mainly white quartzite pebbles) are found in carbonate deposits of the Enciso Group exposed on the northern border of the Cameros rift basin (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, northern Spain). In the Arnedillo section, all the stones are enclosed in micrite, which was assumed deposited in littoral to open lacustrine environments, with minor inputs of deltaic sandstones. The clasts are found in fine-grained lacustrine sediments either as isolated stones or as loosely packed elongated clusters occasionally associated with quartz sands and gravels. The mean size of the clasts is 40 mm (range: 3-100 mm); they are polished, well-rounded, and lack any faceting or striae. Lithology suggests that the clasts were potentially supplied by three stratigraphic formations cropping out in the catchment area of the Cameros lake. The occurrence of outsized stones within featureless micrite indicative of low-energy conditions involves a hydrodynamic paradox which can only be resolved by their vertical or oblique emplacement in the host sediment as dropstones. The lack of mass-flow deposits in the Enciso Group precludes gravitational processes and suggests deposition from a rafting agent. Icebergs and stone-swallowing animals are the main transport agents identified in continental settings. Here, stone swallowing is rejected as the transport mechanism because the stones are loosely packed and are never associated with skeletal remains. Ice rafting is also rejected because of the low density of clusters, and the absence of faceting and striations which characterize glacial sediments. Furthermore, the sub-tropical position of Iberia, the absence of surrounding high relief, and global climatic models for the Aptian corroborate the absence of a glaciolacustrine environment. Consequently, we propose wood rafting as an alternative depositional mechanism for dropstones in non-glacial lacustrine environments. Although no direct evidence has yet been found (i.e. stones enclosed in the roots of rafted woods), several data support our interpretation. First, the occurrence of isolated stones and loosely packed elongated clusters is consistent with the fall of single stones or the disintegration of clods embedded among tree roots. The occurrence of large rafted conifer trunks in lacustrine deposits of the Enciso Group indicates that they may have rafted small clusters of stones from the catchment area into the lake. If wood rafting is a possible depositional mechanism, the occurrence of dropstones is consequently not a sound criterion for inferring the existence of glacial conditions in lacustrine environments. The reliability of wood-rafted dropstones in lacustrine settings as an indicator of paleoclimate is also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is applied only sporadically to determine the extent of mixis and stratification, which is vital for all hydrological and limnological studies. We present a study of the changes in delta O-18, temperature and Schmidt stability in the water column of three adjacent lakes of very different mixis types (polymictic to meromictic) over almost one year (May 2008 to April 2009). The response of delta O-18 to important hydrologic processes (entrainment, stratification, circulation, groundwater inflow) and weather influences (cooling period, ice cover and melt water inflow) is discussed. The lakes are part of the Osterseen chain of lakes south of Munich, Germany. Although hydrologically connected, these lakes show various mixis types (polymictic to meromictic) due to large differences in size, groundwater inflow and water renewal time. Polymixis and the strong subsurface inflow of groundwater in Lake Waschsee (25.6 x 10(3) m(3)) were indicated by the same trends in the delta O-18 signature throughout all water layers and by the mean overall signature (-9.94 parts per thousand) being very close to delta O-18 of local groundwater (-10.01 parts per thousand +/- 0.06). delta O-18 signatures of the larger dimictic Lake Fohnsee (2298.3 x 10(3) m(3)) revealed a highly significant trend towards lower values of delta O-18 in its hypolimnion, indicating inflow of groundwater. A cooling period during the summer stratification characterised by high wind speeds resulted in a considerable drop of lake surface temperatures and Schmidt stability (up to 25%) in lakes Fohnsee and Eishaussee and was followed by a deepening of the mixed upper water layer and entrainment of hypolimnetic water layers. This was clearly shown by a signal change in deeper water layers formerly constant in delta O-18. The permanent meromixis present in Lake Eishaussee (297.0 x 10(3) m(3)) could also be confirmed by isotopic signatures, as bottom water layers remained significantly isolated in delta O-18 from the remaining water column over the whole study period. We summarize that the oxygen isotopic signature of water is an easy to interpret, excellent indicator of important hydrologic processes in a lake and can readily be integrated into routine sampling. The present findings will further contribute to the analysis of hydrological data as well as to the interpretation of paleoclimatic reconstructions using proxies of lake water delta O-18.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2010	69	2					278	286		10.4081/jlimnol.2010.278	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2010.278													WOS:000282859700009

Assessing fecal pollution source in a Northern Michigan Lake using qPCR and a community-based monitoring framework	PLOS ONE												Implementing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) within a community-based research framework expands the scope and scale of community-driven monitoring and research efforts. The increasing accessibility of qPCR technology and methodology has allowed the incorporation of community partners in numerous ways, ranging from sample collection to running qPCR tests. Here, we report on a community-driven study at Crystal Lake in Beulah, MI, in which qPCR was demonstrated to be a more valuable water testing technique than culture-based methods. Historically high levels of the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli in the inlet to Crystal Lake, Cold Creek, as measured by culture-based testing methods, spurred an interest in understanding more about fecal pollution and its source. In this study, we monitored 17 sites in Cold Creek and around Crystal Lake throughout the summers of 2020 and 2021 and used qPCR to assess levels of Enterococcus while source-tracking all samples for human, dog, and Canada goose fecal markers (HF183, DG3 and CG0F1-Bac, respectively). Replicate samples were sent for E. coli culture-based testing. Results showed high fecal contamination (E. coli and Enterococcus) and consistent HF183, DG3 and CG0F1-Bac-positive samples at specific sample sites. Varying degrees of relatedness were found between Enterococcus levels grouped by precipitation amount. Due to the nature of the sampling sites, we hypothesize that human fecal contamination is due to stormwater outflows and septic system influences and not direct human contact with the water. A Cohen's Kappa analysis between the Enterococcus qPCR test results and E. coli culture-based test results indicated a moderately positive relationship. The historical E. coli dataset, now accompanied by the Enterococcus, HF183, DG3 and CG0F1-Bac data, confirms consistent and elevated levels of fecal pollution in Cold Creek and Crystal Lake that is likely related to human sources with stormwater outflows being a contributor to this contamination.

Vegetation and climate dynamics in a 16,600-year marine sequence offshore Mozambique in Delagoa Bight, south-eastern Africa	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Few records of long-term vegetation dynamics and climate variability exist from coastal southeastern Africa. This study presents a new high-resolution marine pollen record (GeoB20615-2) from southern Mozambique, spanning the past c. 16,600 years. The chronology is based on a Bayesian age-depth model constructed using twelve radiocarbon dates on marine and terrestrial remains. Prior to c. 15,000 cal BP, pollen from ericaceous shrubs was prevalent, indicating low temperatures, while forest or woodland pollen taxa were minimal or absent. From c. 13,000 cal BP onwards, the record shows a gradual increase in savanna pollen taxa such as Spirostachys and Burkea, suggesting climatic warming. Pollen of Spirostachys, a woodland tree thriving in dry, warm regions, continues to increase into the early Holocene, between c. 11,200 and 9200 cal BP. After c. 9200 cal BP, a decline in Spirostachys pollen corresponds with a rise in Podocarpus pollen during a phase of high sea levels, indicating a potential expansion in coastal and/or montane forests, possibly reflecting increased moisture availability. From c. 3500 cal BP, Podocarpus pollen declines, likely due to more arid conditions, as indicated by a concomitant increase in Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, and Spirostachys pollen. The youngest section of the profile is potentially affected by sediment mixing from c. 250 cal BP onwards. The section reveals the impact of European colonialists, with the appearance of neophytic pine pollen, and an increase in indigenous Alchornea, a disturbance indicator. The pollen results are in good agreement with terrestrial palynological records from the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Biome such as Lake Eteza in northeastern South Africa. The GeoB20615-2 record contributes greater understanding of long-term vegetation dynamics and associated climatic shifts in the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Biome.

Revisiting Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) in the Stansbury Mountains, Utah	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D.K. Bailey) presence in the Stansbury Mountains of north central Utah has been reported prior to the year 2020, but these reports lack adequate population characterization and the delineation of distinct stands of trees. In summer 2020, we identified and documented the presence of 5 separate stands of bristlecone pine in the Stansbury Mountains. These stands are removed from the nearest bristlecone populations in other mountain ranges by a distance of approximately 120 km; as such, they represent a unique outlier population of the species. We used GPS data to create a geographic information system (GIS) database delineating the 5 stands we identified, and we sampled tree age and size in one of the stands for comparison with other bristlecone pine populations in the Great Basin. We present here 2 hypotheses to explain the occurrence of bristlecone pine in the Stansbury Mountains: first, that this population is a relict from a time when bristlecone pine was widely distributed across the Great Basin; and second, that the species arrived in the range via long-distance dispersal mechanisms at some point during or after the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (ca. 12,000 14C YBP). Neotoma (woodrat) midden data suggest that bristlecone pine was absent or at least not widespread in the northern Bonneville Basin during the late Pleistocene, but midden data are sparse for the Stansbury Mountains and surrounding ranges. Additionally, we present possible migration pathways that the species could have taken to reach the Stansbury Mountains from the southern Bonneville Basin, where it was widespread during the late Pleistocene, using the largest extent of Lake Bonneville as a limiting boundary. Hypothesized migration vectors include windborne long-distance dispersal events or transport by granivorous birds. We also postulate that a small population of bristle cone pine may be present in the Oquirrh Mountains to the east of the Stansbury Mountains based upon the existence of similar habitat characteristics there, as well as our identification of a likely misdetermined 1964 voucher specimen from the Oquirrh Mountains that appears to be of bristlecone pine.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				JUN	2023	83	1					8	22																WOS:001069464200002

Human settlements adapted to environmental changes through the Paleolithic and Neolithic times in West Iraq	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Euphrates Flood Plain sediments are recorded in Barwana city which is 6 km south of Haditha City. Much vegetation and climatic and archaeological evidences in this study pointed to several stages of old human settlements in that area. Palynological evidences show the livelihood of those humans before the great Noah Deluge of the period 10,500 years before present (BP). Their food was gathered by collecting crops and hunting animals in a steppe region along the valleys. As a result of this suffering from deluge and climatic variations that affected the region, humans had taken the search for a new way of living by trying to settle in the areas near the Euphrates river and attempted cultivation of this land, where the study showed the first appearance of field crop (cereals) pollens, such as wheat, barley, corn aEuro broken vertical bar, etc., at depth of 475-500 cm of the studies section, which represents a warm-humid climate with summer precipitation during the period of 10,000-5,000 years BP. These environmental conditions helped the ancient humans to settle in the agriculture village of Barwana, living on cultivation of the land and domesticating animals, such as grazing animals, for their main forms of food. Evolving palm cultivation and record of many archaeological ceramic pieces in the sample at a depth of 250 cm emphasized his attempt to establish industrial culture in the region after a period of changing climate to warm and dry which affected the region since 6,000 years BP and changed the Barwana settlements to an industrial village. The grasses and tree exploitation for sheep shepherding, building houses, and fire use, as well as dam building and Naoor manufacture for irrigation added evidences for ancient cities developments such as Hanat (Presently Ana) and Heet since about 5000 Y.BP. The desertification manifestation of that warm and dry climate continued from that time to the present with drought increased and deficiency in the rainfall, as well as the human irresponsible activities, as evidenced by increased pollen and spores of Compositae and Bongardia.

J	FERNANDEZ, J; BLUCK, BJ; VISERAS, C				FERNANDEZ, J; BLUCK, BJ; VISERAS, C			THE EFFECTS OF FLUCTUATING BASE-LEVEL ON THE STRUCTURE OF ALLUVIAL-FAN ASSOCIATED FAN-DELTA DEPOSITS - AN EXAMPLE FROM THE TERTIARY-OF-THE-BETIC-CORDILLERA, SPAIN	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Villanueva Complex is a lacustrine alluvial fan - fan delta system which accumulated on the northern margin of the Guadix Basin during the Pliocene. Five transitional zones can be distinguished from proximal to distal areas: proximal alluvial fan, mid-fan, fan fringe (transition zone), proximal fan delta and distal fan delta (lacustrine). This paper focuses on sedimentation in the fan fringe and the proximal fan delta areas, where the effects of fluctuations in the base level (lacustrine level) are more easily observed. The stratigraphical succession is here characterized by an alternation of fine lacustrine sediments (mudstones and siltstones) and gravels. The gravels appear as isolated channels, stacked channels,lenses and sheets. The isolated channels, which have a V-shaped profile and better developed wings towards the top, appear in the fan fringe zone and in the fan delta. The stacked channels originate in the fan fringe zone and evolve laterally and distally to isolated channels. The lenticular gravel bodies (lenses) are well represented throughout the fan delta and present small channels at the base, indicating a radial flow pattern. Finally, the sheets are characteristic of the fan fringe zone. The first episodes of channel incision occurred at lowstand lake level. The channels and lenses developed in rising lake level conditions, and sheet deposit took place at highstand lake level. Although the final form of the lithosome was heavily controlled by the fluctuations in lake level, it depended on the relative proportions of gravel and silt sedimentation. The gravel-siltstone interface therefore represents an equilibrium surface between the proportions of sedimentation of these lithologies. The bodies mentioned above are organized in coarsening and thickening upwards sequences tens of metres thick, in which a distal to proximal evolution can be observed from isolated channels to lenses or from stacked channels to sheets. The building and thickness of these sequences were controlled by fluctuations in the lake level. An initial fall in base level caused lengthening of the channels and entrenchment from distal to proximal areas, and a continuous increase in supply doe to erosion in the drainage basin installed on the subaerial fan. When the lake level rose, lobes were formed at the channel endings and overbank processes were made possible, thus generating radial channels, whose levees were formed by amalgamation with the levees of the main lens channels. At the same time, sheets were formed in proximal areas, where the available amount of sediment was greater.

J	Lemaire, N; Pelletier, É				Lemaire, Nicolas; Pelletier, Emilien			Chemical and Microbial Contamination Baseline in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park (Eastern Canada): Concentrations and Fluxes From Land-Based Sources	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Stretching halfway between the Canadian Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean, the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park is subject to environmental issues being exposed to untreated or uncontrolled point and non-point sources of anthropogenic contamination. This article provides a first estimation of chemical and microbial contamination entering the marine park from the discharges of local municipal effluents and the inputs of tributaries in the summer period. Suspended particulate matter (SPM), nutrients, particulate carbon (PC) and nitrogen, trace metals, and fecal coliform bacteria were determined in surface brackish waters at upstream boundaries, in freshwater of 11 tributaries, and in nine sewage effluents from small communities settled along the marine park. Most tributaries have SPM < 10 mg L-1 and contributed to a total of similar to 47 tons day(-1), thus representing a small proportion of daily SPM transported by Saguenay River (200 tons day(-1)) and St. Lawrence River (6.3 x 10(3) tons day(-1)). As expected, untreated sewage effluents showed high fecal contamination (0.2-6.0 x 10(6) CFU 100 mL(-1)), high NO (x) levels (4-33 mu mol L-1) and high concentrations of particulate organic carbon (7-62 mg L-1). However, all tributaries had low coliforms (< 230 CFU 100 mL(-1)), low PC (0.3-1.1 mg L-1), and low nutrients (NO (x) < 3.3 mu mol L-1), with the exception of the Moulin-A -Baude River, a small tributary (2.3 x 10(5) m(3) day(-1)) clearly contaminated by human activities. Detailed analysis of 14 metals and metalloids in SPM did not show any clear contamination trend between sewage effluents and tributaries, except for Grandes-Bergeronnes River, where most trace metals appeared to be greater than for other rivers. Regarding global inputs, results showed that despite their relatively high pollutants load, inputs from local sewages and small tributaries remained minor contributors compared with upstream inputs, i.e., Saguenay River and St. Lawrence River. However, we illustrate that some local hydrodynamic factors in bays and inlets must be taken into account when evaluating risks associated with sewage discharges.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				OCT	2013	65	3					421	433		10.1007/s00244-013-9911-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-013-9911-7								23695715					WOS:000324074200006

Using varved sediments from Lake Sagtjernet in southeastern Norway, we developed a hydrogen isotope record from sedimentary leaf waxes (n-alkanes) as a proxy for hydrogen isotopes in precipitation, which we interpret as an indicator of temperature variability over the past 2000 years. The climate reconstruction provides high, decadal resolution for the period 360-770 CE, allowing critical evaluation during the Dark Ages Cold Period (around 300-800 CE) and a cooling during the 6th century, previously suggested as the coldest period of the Common Era. Our results reveal that the most rapid drop in temperature occurred from 536 to 545 CE ((+74)/(-90) years), corresponding in time to the 536 and 540 CE volcanic eruptions. We also document an inferred cold interval that persisted from around 650 to 710 CE ((+72)/(-90) years). While past studies have suggested prolonged cooling during the Dark Ages Cold Period, our findings show that, on average, the climate during 360-770 CE was similar to the Common Era average in the Lake Sagtjernet record. To explore socio-environmental interactions throughout the past 2000 years, we present a pollen-based environmental reconstruction and integrate it with archaeological evidence from around Lake Sagtjernet. These analyses reveal significant societal activities such as land clearing, cereal cultivation, and large-scale iron production, which drastically altered the landscape in the Viking Age (around 800-1050 CE) and the first half of the Norwegian Middle Ages (around 1050-1350 CE). Modern cultivation practices following the Black Death (1349-1350 CE) were first established around 1470 CE and increased continuously until around 1940 CE. Intensification of societal activities through the past millennium, including iron production and modern cultivation, occurred during both warmer (Medieval Climate Anomaly; 950-1250 CE) and colder (Little Ice Age; 1450-1850 CE) periods.

J	Moxham, C; Kenny, SA; Fanson, B				Moxham, Claire; Kenny, Sally A.; Fanson, Ben			Environmental flows and microsite attributes influence floodplain eucalypt recruitment	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Globally, river regulation and water extraction for anthropogenic use have altered the hydrology and ecology of riverine and floodplain ecosystems. Managed environmental flows are increasingly being implemented to restore the condition of many riverine and floodplain ecosystems. In the Murray-Darling River Basin, south-eastern Australia, appropriate flooding regimes are key to maintaining populations of the dominant floodplain forests and woodland trees, River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and Black Box (E. largiflorens). We investigated the effects of three environmental flow events and microsite attributes (bare ground, canopy and understorey vegetation) on eucalypt recruitment over a five-year period across a semi-arid floodplain gradient (lake bed, lower and higher floodplain). Eucalypt recruitment increased after the environmental flows. The probability of recruitment declined with increasing elevation along the floodplain gradient, with the highest occurrence on the lake bed and lower floodplain where River Red Gum dominates. Recruitment on the higher floodplain, where Black Box is dominant, was low, suggesting that factors other than flooding (e.g. poor tree health) may limit regeneration. Recruitment also increased with increasing cover of bare ground and understorey vegetation. Saplings (>1 m) were more likely to occur on the lower floodplain, where understorey vegetation cover approached 50 %, suggesting that the germination and survival niches of eucalypts may differ. That is, bare ground is necessary for germination, while understorey vegetation may provide protection to seedlings from desiccation and browsing. The combined flood events likely benefited the survival of pre-established seedlings by limiting the effects of summer desiccation and increasing soil moisture availability. There may be a trade-off between managing environmental flows for seed germination versus seedling survival. Future environmental flows that target the higher floodplain are likely to contribute to improvements in tree health, reproductive output and subsequent recruitment opportunities in this floodplain ecosystem. This study shows that environmental flows likely contribute to the maintenance of sustainable eucalypt floodplain forests and woodlands through the facilitation of recruitment and seedling persistence.

J	Ding, ZY; Lu, RJ; Lyu, ZQ; Liu, XK				Ding, Zhiyong; Lu, Ruijie; Lyu, Zhiqiang; Liu, Xiaokang			Geochemical characteristics of Holocene aeolian deposits east of Qinghai Lake, China, and their paleoclimatic implications (vol 692, pg 917, 2019)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The paleoclimate evolution of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), especially in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), has long been a subject of interest to scholars due to the particularity of the geographical location. However, because of the uncertainties of the chronologies and the interpretations of the proxies used, climate change in this region remains controversial during the Holocene. The Hudong dunefield is located to the east of Qinghai Lake and is the largest sand accumulation area in the QLB. In this study, deposits in the Holocene aeolian sand-paleosol sequences Chengou East (CGE) and Qinghaihu Country (QHH) in the Hudong dunefield were analyzed to determine their elemental geochemical characteristics and paleoclimatic implications. Combining the grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) and redness, we investigate the paleoclimate changes in this region and its response to the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) during the Holocene. The high Na2O/Al2O3 ratios and low chemical index of alteration (CIA) values suggest that most of the sediments are unweathered to weakly weathered, although some mid-Holocene samples are moderately weathered. The multiproxy analysis indicates that the local climate was broadly coincident with that of the northeastern TP and most regions of northern China, implying that the paleoclimate of the QLB was closely related with the evolution of the EASM during the Holocene. Additionally, after the 9.2 ka BP cold event, the chemical weathering increased gradually. The higher CIA and TOC contents and lower redness and mean grain size from 8.7 to 4.0 ka BP are possibly associated with the mid-Holocene optimum period and indicate intensified chemical weathering, denser vegetation cover and weakened aeolian activity in the QLB in response to a warmer and more humid climate. After 4.0 ka BP, the lower degrees of chemical weathering indicate that the study area was dominated by a relatively cold and dry climate, and several alternating warm-wet and cold-dry intervals occurred from 3.1 to 0.6 ka BP.<bold> </bold>					Lyu, Zhiqiang/MEP-2072-2025; Ding, Zhiyong/IUQ-0526-2023; lu, ruijie/AEL-2664-2022	DING, Zhiyong/0000-0002-6658-7460; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 1	2020	719								136716	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136716								31959373					WOS:000521936300038

Progressive derangement of ancient (Mesozoic) east-west Nevadaplano paleochannels into modern (Miocene-Holocene) north-northwest trends in the Walker Lane Belt, central Sierra Nevada	GEOSPHERE												Eocene to Pliocene paleochannels of the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) were first exploited for gold placer deposits during the California gold rush (1848), and then mapped in surveys more than century ago. The surveys showed that the paleochannels flowed westward, like the modern rivers of the range; it then was assumed that the heads of the paleochannels were at the modern range crest. A first paradigm shift occurred similar to 50 yr ago, when it was recognized that at least some of the paleochannel fill was sourced from the region of the current state of Nevada, and it was proposed that the Sierra Nevada range was younger than the paleochannels (younger than 6 Ma). More recent work has demonstrated that Sierran paleochannels are ancient features that formed on the shoulder of a broad high uplift (the Nevadaplano) formed during Cretaceous crustal shortening; the headwaters were in central Nevada prior to disruption of the plateau by Basin and Range extension. A second paradigm shift occurred in the past decade: the Sierra Nevada range front is formed of north-northwest transtensional structures of the younger than 12 Ma Walker Lane belt, not north-south to north-northeast-south-southwest extensional structures of the Basin and Range. In this paper we use detailed geologic mapping to reconstruct the paleogeographic evolution of three Oligo-cene to Pliocene east-west paleochannels in the central Sierra Nevada, and their progressive south to north derangement by Walker Lane structures: the Stanislaus in the south, the Cataract in the middle, and the Mokelumne in the north. Previous work has shown that east-west Nevadaplano paleochannels in the central Sierra have four stratigraphic sequences floored by erosional unconformities; we describe distinguishing characteristics between the ancient Nevada-plano paleochannels and the north-northwest-deranged paleochannels of the Walker Lane grabens. In the east-west paleochannels unconformity 1 is the deepest, eroded into mesozonal Cretaceous plutons; it is overlain by the Oligocene to early Miocene Valley Springs Formation (sequence 1), consisting of ignimbrites erupted similar to 250 km to the east in Nevada. Sequence 1 is the most useful for tracing the courses of the paleochannels because it was deposited before faulting began; however, it is incompletely preserved, due to erosion along unconformity 2 (with as much as 500 m of relief) as well as later erosional events. Sequence 2 consists of ca. 16-12 Ma andesitic volcaniclastic rocks referred to as the Relief Peak Formation; it occurs in all three paleochannels (Stanislaus, Cataract, and Mokelumne) as stratified fluvial and debris flow deposits, with abundant cut and fill structures. However, we show for the first time that Relief Peak Formation also forms the basal fill of a Walker Lane transtensional basin system that began to form by ca. 12 Ma, in a full graben along what is now the Sierra Crest, and in transfer zone basins and half-grabens on what is now the eastern range front. The Relief Peak Formation in the Walker Lane transtensional basins consists of massive (nonstratified) andesitic debris flow deposits and debris avalanche deposits, with slabs as much as 2 km long, including slabs of the Valley Springs Formation. Sequence 3 in the Nevadaplano paleochannels consists of distinctive, voluminous high-K lavas and ignimbrites of the Stanislaus Group. The lavas were erupted from fissures in the transtensional Sierra Crest graben-vent system, which beheaded the Stanislaus paleochannel prior to development of unconformity 3 and eruption of the voluminous basal lavas, referred to as the Table Mountain Latite (TML). In the Cataract paleochannel, TML lavas are inset as much as 100 m into the Relief Peak Formation along unconformity 3, indicating fluvial reincision within the paleochannel; TML lavas were ponded in the graben-vent system to thicknesses 6 times greater than the paleochannel fill, with no reincision surfaces. Sequence 3 ignimbrites of the Stanislaus Group (Eureka Valley Tuff) were erupted from the Little Walker caldera, and mark the course of all three paleochannels, with channel reincision surfaces between them (but not in the grabens). Sequence 3 lavas in the paleochannels differ from those in the grabens by having interstratified fluvial deposits, stretched vesicles parallel to the paleo-channels, tree molds, peperitic bases, and kuppaberg (cobble jointed) tops, which form when water penetrates into a cooling lava along vertical joints, allowing secondary joints to form perpendicular to them. The Cataract paleochannel was deranged from its ancient (Mesozoic) east-west Nevadaplano trend into the north-northwest Walker Lane tectonic trend prior to development of unconformity 4 and deposition of sequence 4 (Disaster Peak Formation). The north-northwest-deranged Cataract paleochannel is along the Sierra Crest between the Stanislaus and Mokelumne paleo-channels, with fluvial deposits indicating northward flow; this paleochannel is perpendicular to the ancient east-west Nevadaplano paleo-channels, and parallel to modern Walker Lane drainages, indicating tectonic reorganization of the landscape ca. 9-5 Ma. This derangement was followed by progressive beheading of the Mokelumne paleochannel, development of the Ebbetts Pass pull-apart basin (ca. 6 Ma) and the Ebbetts Pass stratovolcano within it (ca. 5-4 Ma), which fed lava into the relict Mokelumne paleochannel. The derangement of central Sierran paleochannels proceeded as follows, from south to north: (1) the Stanislaus paleochannel was beheaded by ca. 11 Ma; (2) the Cataract paleochannel became deranged from an east-west Nevada-plano trend into a north-northwest Walker Lane trend by ca. 9 Ma, now exposed along the Sierran crest; and (3) the Mokelumne paleochannel was beheaded by ca. 6-5 Ma, and the Carson Pass-Kirkwood paleochannel several kilometers to the north was deranged from east-west into the north-northwest Hope Valley graben ca. 6 Ma. The next paleochannel to the north is in the southern part of the northern Sierra at Lake Tahoe, and based on published descriptions was beheaded ca. 3 Ma. The timing of paleochannel beheading corresponds to the northward migration of the Mendocino Triple Junction and northward propagation of the Walker Lane transtensional strain regime. This paper illustrates in detail the interplay between tectonics and drainage development, exportable to a very broad variety of settings.

J	Curry, BB; Anderson, AC				Curry, B. Brandon; Anderson, Andrew C.			Midwest North American full glacial paleohydrology from fresh water ostracodes: Comparison of Clementsian and Gleasonian methodologies	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Here we explore the results and differences of two methods for reconstructing climatic and paleohydrological conditions from two sites in central North America during the Last Glacial Maximum. The Clementsian assemblage-based Mutual Climate Range (MCR) and Gleasonian species-range-based Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range (MOTR) methods are featured. We use autecological data from the North American Ostracode Database (NACODe) that includes water chemistry, physical data, location, and ambient climatic information from 7328 sites and the presence of 108 ostracode species. Reconstructions of last glacial average temperatures for January and July means, average mean annual temperature, mean total annual precipitation, and total dissolved solids of the host water are provided for records at Bellefontaine Quarry (Missouri) and Prides Creek (Indiana). The successions collectively date from about 25,100 to 18,300 cal yr BP. Our novel python program enables MCR calculations with results that fall within the envelope of values determined by MOTR. The program enables the user to determine the critical number of species that yield data less influenced by data structure and tending toward redundant but representative environmental and hydrochemical paleo-conditions. Data from sites with common species below the critical number are controlled by the biogeographic structure of NACODe; above the critical number, analog data reflect physiochemical attributes operating under a range of climatic conditions. The greater mean species richness of the Prides Creek record (x = 12) compared to Bellefontaine (x = 6) results in smoother profiles of mean Clementsian Mutual Climate Range values. We have modified an analog selection and ranking routine by favoring sites with sensitive species as defined by an environmental tolerance index. For average mean July temperature and mean total dissolved solids, the Prides Creek MCR-ETI profiles have approximately the same value as average values given by the Gleasonian Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range procedure. For average mean annual temperature and average mean January temperatures, MCR-ETI values plot on the cooler side of the MOTR envelopes, but still entirely within the envelope. For both records, mean total annual precipitation MCR-ETI profiles are on the arid side of the Gleasonian envelope. These results likely reflect the location of analog sites with the largest number of environmentally sensitive ostracodes and matching species located in southern Minnesota and Wisconsin at or near the edge of the prairie-forest transition where potential evapotranspiration is about equal to mean annual precipitation.

A national climate program, complying with the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU, is aimed at long-term adaptation measures to climate change, providing for the development of legislation in the field of environmental protection, sectoral strategies, improving air and water quality. These measures require identification of climatic factors' impact on hydrological characteristics of water bodies in any area in order to protect and improve them, as well as a comprehensive approach to the rational management of water resources. Analysis of previous research. Using mathematical models of atmospheric circulation allows us to obtain generalized calculations of the average global and regional air temperature, characterized by significant errors in case of different models. Problems of further research. Modern changes in climatic conditions in Ukraine are characterized by locality and rapidity: increasing number of anomalous atmospheric phenomena, frequency of droughts, dry winds which, according to preliminary estimates, may lead to reduction of water resources, changes in internal annual redistribution of water temperature and runoff against the background of increasing thermal resources of the territory. The purpose. The article analyses climatic indicators' influence on the main hydrological characteristics on the example of the Psyol river basin within Ukraine. Research methods. Research methods are presented by statistical and cartographic analysis (correlation analysis method). The initial information is the results of observations contained in the State Climate Cadastre and the State Water Cadastre for the Dnieper Valley. Presentation of the main research material. Analysis of climate change in the Psyol river basin indicates a decrease in water consumption, both in the main river of the basin and in its main tributaries. In addition to changes in temperature and humidity, the reasons for this process were the shifts that occurred in the nature of the intra-annual distribution of the runoff. During the late XX - early XXI century the share of spring floods decreased due to the reduced period of ice phenomena and corresponding decrease in the thickness of the snow cover on the rivers. As a result, the most important component of the annual runoff of rivers began to decrease rapidly. The role of groundwater in the formation of water runoff increased against the background of a predominant decrease in precipitation. This is especially true for medium-size and small rivers, subject to significant anthropogenic pressure: over-regulation of channels, creation of artificial lakes, their shallowing. Practical value. Based on the main provisions of the national environmental policy of Ukraine on the use of water resources and the implementation of European principles of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60 / EC (ERVD) the study of changes in hydrological regime of rivers is of practical importance for sustainable management. Research results. The study of the impact of changes in climatic indicators on hydrological characteristics makes it possible to determine the reference conditions and classes of ecological status of rivers under conditions of anthropogenic pressure against the background of further changes in climatic indicators that will have different trends.					; Dmitriiev, Sviatoslav/LFV-5270-2024; Reshetchenko, Svitlana/JSL-6490-2023	Resetcenko, Svitlana/0000-0003-0744-4272; 													2410-7360	2411-3913					2020		53					155	168		10.26565/2410-7360-2020-53-12	http://dx.doi.org/10.26565/2410-7360-2020-53-12													WOS:000637863100012

Thresholds in the storm response of a catchment-lake system and the occurrence and magnitude of lake overflows: Implications for flood frequency	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] This model-based study examines the combined effects of catchment and lake thresholds upon the frequency and magnitude of lake-overflow events, and their impacts on flood frequency. A dominant control of lake-overflow events is antecedent storage, which is governed by the climate and by the properties of the contributing catchment. The next major control was shown to be the magnitude of storm depths, and their adequacy to replenish and exceed the lake storage deficit, which are governed by the ratio of catchment to lake areas, AC/AL. When AC/AL is large, lake-overflows can be triggered even at larger antecedent lake storage deficits. This points to the importance of AC/AL as a critical parameter governing the frequency and magnitude of lake-overflow events. As regards the catchment properties, model simulations indicate that fast draining catchments enhance the triggering of lake-overflow events due to the fact that the drainage is rapid and there is the opportunity for faster runoff contributions to combine with direct rainfall on the lakes to exceed antecedent lake storage deficit and overcome the reducing influence of evaporation during inter-storm periods. Slow draining catchments, on the other hand, will not release runoff fast enough to replenish the lake storage deficit before the evaporative effects take hold. The shape of the resulting flood frequency curve captures the dominant lake-overflow generating mechanisms. When the dominant lake overflow generating mechanism is catchment runoff, the shape of flood frequency curve of lake-overflows resembles the shape of the catchment flood frequency curve, including the effects of associated thresholds. On the other hand, when the dominant lake overflow generating mechanism is direct rainfall falling on the lake, the shape of the lake-overflow flood frequency curve exhibits a persistent truncation below a critical return period that is associated with the frequency of flow termination for the given climate in question. These results have provided valuable insights into the relative roles of climate, soil depth, the soil's drainage capacity as well as the ratio of catchment area to lake area on flood frequency of catchment-lake systems in general. The improved understanding of these process controls will be useful in assisting the management of such combined catchment-lake systems. In particular, they can provide valuable guidance towards the monitoring of catchment-lake systems in ways that are targeted towards those controls which are critical to the determination of the magnitude and frequency of lake-overflow events to assist in flood prevention and mitigation.

In the Asian drylands, West Asia (WA) and arid central Asia (ACA) are both climatically dominated by the westerlies and have shown a dipole pattern in precipitation variation during the past several decades. However, it is unclear whether such a difference exists during the Holocene, mainly because the dispute between the delta 18O-based early Holocene hydroclimate optimum and the pollen-based mid-Holocene optimum in WA. Here we present a precisely dated record based on lipid biomarkers from Almalou Peatland in the western Iranian Plateau. The chain length of n-alkanoic acids was interpreted as a hydroclimate indicator based on a proxy validation study. Our record reveals a wetting trend during 9-7.5 cal ka BP, a mid-Holocene hydroclimate optimum (7.5-3 cal ka BP), and a rapidly drying trend during 3-0 cal ka BP. The hydroclimate variation was supported by a water-level reconstruction from the same core. The most negative delta 18O values during the early Holocene could be partly attributed to the impacts of water vapor sources. Comparing our reconstruction from WA to those from ACA, we found a dipole pattern of hydroclimate variations on the millennial timescale during the Holocene. The simulation results revealed that, unlike the persistent wetting trend in ACA, the pivotal shift of spring insolation led to a transition from wetting to drying conditions in WA, ultimately leading to the generation of dipole pattern. This demonstrates that despite the consistent control by westerlies over the Asian drylands, there are distinct spatial differences in hydroclimate responses to natural forcings. Asian drylands are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to scarce water availability. Although West Asia (WA) and arid central Asia (ACA) within the Asian drylands are both climatically dominated by the westerlies, the precipitation variation in ACA (WA) showed a generally increasing (decreasing) trend during the anthropogenic warming period. To understand the long-term hydroclimate response to natural forcings, we investigated the variations in the hydroclimate during the Holocene. While the long-term wetting trend in ACA during the Holocene has been investigated, the contradictory hydroclimate reconstructions in WA hinder our ability to address this question. The alpine peatland serves as a sensitive monitor of regional hydroclimate variation. By analyzing biomarker and pollen in the peat sediments from WA, we could understand how the climate changed over time. Our study showed that climate became wetter from 9000 to 7500 years ago, had a period of optimal hydroclimate from 7500 to 3000 years ago, and then became rapidly drier in the last 3000 years. We compared our findings to other studies in ACA and found that the dipole pattern of hydroclimate variation existed on the millennial timescale within Asian drylands, representing a primary climatic characteristic in these vulnerable regions. Holocene hydroclimate is reconstructed in West Asia based on multiple proxies including lipid biomarkers and pollen spectra A mid-Holocene hydroclimate maximum is revealed, facilitating forest expansion in the large area of West Asia Despite the consistent control by westerlies in Asian drylands, there are spatial differences in hydroclimate responses to natural forcings					Ma, Shuai/IUO-8432-2023; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Khormali, Farhad/AAA-8236-2020; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Ji, Panpan/AAY-4217-2021; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018	Ma, Shuai/0000-0003-1686-2871; , Panpan Ji/0000-0003-4647-3703; Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Chen, Shengqian/0000-0001-9550-7653; Chen, Jianhui/0000-0002-6768-1619; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 16	2024	129	7							e2023JD039413	10.1029/2023JD039413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039413													WOS:001193573500001

Isotopic characterization of rapid climatic events during OIS3 and OIS4 in Villars Cave stalagmites (SW-France) and correlation with Atlantic and Mediterranean pollen records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a new mid-latitude speleothem record of millennial-scale climatic variability during OIS3 from the Villars Cave that, combined with former published contemporaneous samples from the same cave, gives a coherent image of the climate variability in SW-France between similar to 55 ka and similar to 30 ka. The 0.82 m long stalagmite Vil-stm27 was dated with 26 TIMS U-Th analyses and its growth curve displays variations that are linked with the stable isotopes, both controlled by the climatic conditions. It consists in a higher resolved replicate of the previously published Vil-stm9 and Vil-stm14 stalagmites where Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events have been observed. The good consistency between these three stalagmites and the comparison with other palaoeclimatic reconstructions, especially high resolution pollen records (ODP 976 from the Alboran Sea, Monticchio Lake record from southern Italy) and the nearby MD04-2845 Atlantic Ocean record, permits to draw a specific climatic pattern in SW-France during the 063 and to see regional differences between these sites. Main features of this period are: 1) warm events corresponding to Greenland Interstadials (GIS) that are characterized by low speleothem delta C-13, high temperate pollen percentages, warm temperatures and high humidity; among these events, GIS#12 is the most pronounced one at Villars characterized by an abrupt onset at similar to 46.6 ka and a duration of about 2.5 ka. The other well individualized warm event coincides with GIS#8 which is however much less pronounced and occurred during a cooler period as shown by a lower growth rate and a higher delta C-13; 2) cold events corresponding to Greenland Stadials (GS) that are clearly characterized by high speleothem delta C-13, low temperate pollen abundance, low temperature and enhanced dryness, particularly well expressed during GS coinciding with Heinrich events H5 and H4. The main feature of the Villars record is a general cooling trend between the DO#12 event similar to 45.5 ka and the synchronous stop of the three stalagmites at similar to 30 ka +/- 1, with a first well marked climatic threshold at similar to 41 ka after which the growth rate and the diameter of all stalagmites slows down significantly. This climatic evolution differs from that shown at southern Mediterranean sites where this trend is not observed. The similar to 30 ka age marks the second climatic threshold after which low temperatures and low rainfalls prevent speleothem growth in the Villars area until the Lateglacial warming that occurred at similar to 16.5 +/- 0.5 ka. This 15 ka long hiatus, as the older Villars growth hiatus that occurred between 67.4 and 61 ka, are linked to low sea levels, reduced ocean circulation and a southward shift of the Polar Front that likely provoked local permafrost formation. These cold periods coincide with both low summer 65 degrees N insolation, low atmospheric CO2 concentration and large ice sheets development (especially the Fennoscandian). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Al-Hurban, A; Duane, MJ				Al-Hurban, Adeeba; Duane, Michael J.			Reconstruction of Holocene paleohydrological and sedimentological characteristics of Umm Ar-Rimam basin (northern Kuwait)	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The paleohydrological and sedimentological characteristics of a playa lake in northern Kuwait (Arabian Gulf) are reconstructed using sedimentological, geochemical, and isotopic techniques. The sequence consists of up to 8 cycles of S-poor, alluvial sediments capped by a thin organic soil interbedded with gravity-fall calcrete sediments. The succession is locally derived from mainly Quaternary sediments and is regressive with upsection filling of the subsiding basin by cycles of sheetwash flow in response to climatic change. There is no natural, open-water lake water as indicated by low total organic carbon (TOC) data, but the presence of incised calcrete yardangs suggests that more extensive open-water conditions were operative in the past. Stable isotope (delta O-18 parts per thousand and delta C-13 parts per thousand) values of the authigenic carbonates indicate the following three distinct processes: evaporation, meteoric fluid infiltration, and rapid per-descensum flow (rapid downward movement of water and playa sediment through pipes) through a porous, clastic sequence. Because evaporites are scarce, other factors besides evaporation action control chemical and isotopic compositions of the per-decensum lake fluids. Consequently, the isotopic composition cannot be interpreted exclusively as an indicator of salinity or evaporation ratio. The degassing of CO2 during groundwater discharge may explain the enriched carbon isotope values for the authigenic carbonates precipitated in the sediments. Hydrologically closed lake water bodies tend to show low negative carbonate oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures. Isotopically negative delta C-13 values imply a strong input of soil-zone carbon to the groundwater of the top 60 cm of the sediment. Lakes that are hydrologically closed and evaporate or equilibrate with atmospheric CO2 will tend to have low negative delta O-18 and delta C-13 values in the carbonates as reported by Talbot (Chem Geol: Isotope Geosci Sect 80(4): 261-279, 1990). Biologically active lakes will tend toward lower delta C-13 of dissolved carbon due to the photosynthetic effects of C-12 withdrawal as reported by Dunagan and Driese (J Sed Res 69: 772-783, 1999). Increased biological activity during sedimentation may account for low carbon isotope values where plants were abundant, but in shrinkage-dominated systems (those of clay-rich soil subjecting to wet-dry conditions), carbon isotopes will be largely inherited from the calcretic limestones in the land extending landward of the coast and not influenced by coastal processes (known as hinterland), such as Umm Ar-Rimam depression. This basin does not fit the classic shallow playa-type basins of the Arabian Peninsula but rather the recharge playas of the southwestern USA.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				SEP	2016	9	13							621	10.1007/s12517-016-2644-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-016-2644-y													WOS:000384319000012
J	Salamon, T; Zielinski, T				Salamon, Tomasz; Zielinski, Tomasz			Development of a Gilbert-type delta in the kame environment: An example from NE Poland	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Pleistocene kame deltas are known mainly from glaciomarginal environments, whereas there are fewer examples of deltas where kames formed within decaying ice sheets. In this article, we describe deposits of a Gilberttype delta formed inside a glacial system. The delta successionwas identified in the upper part of the hill, a glacial landform developed within the southern sector of the Scandinavian ice sheet in NE Poland during the Warthian glaciation. The landform is interpreted as a kame, the sediments of which were accumulated in an elongated ice crevasse oriented perpendicularly to the front of the ice sheet. The kamewas formed in several stages. In themain stage of development, the crevasse was filled with a lake into which the delta prograded. The lake subsequently underwent a few phases of shallowing, and even an episode of complete drainage. The main delta unit was identified in the outcrop. It is composed of a delta slope and prodelta sediments. A partly preserved older deltaic unit of the initial phase of delta sedimentation alsowas found. The steep (22-42 degrees) slope of the delta is dominated by gravel and sand. The gravels were deposited from high-energy grain flows and grain falls. Sands were deposited mainly from traction currents during periods when the delta-supplying system was less active. Aggradation of the prodelta was mainly due to sand deposition from traction underflows. Deposition from turbidity currents occurred sporadically there. We explain this unusual situation by the fact that the gravelly sediments feeding the delta slope were relatively well-sorted and contained only small admixtures of fine sand and silt. The sediment sorting process took place in a system of englacial or supraglacial conduits, where the gravels were depleted of fine-grained particles. The development of the Gilbert-type delta was possible because the glacial lake, at least 6-8mdeep, periodically maintained a relatively constant water level, which allowed the delta to prograde. This process required the existence of a steady outflow of water from the lake, which was then an open hydrological system. In the final stage of kame formation, when the lake was completely drained, gravel accumulated from shallow sheet flows. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The method draws upon Bayesian Statistics as the main inference engine, as outlined by Box and Draper (1965), M.J. Box (1971) and Box and Tiao (1973/1992). The Bayesian approach allows the calculation of the uncertainty of parameters and predictions both before and after the model is confronted with data. There are several modelling objectives that can be dealt with through this technique in a unifying way: calibration of parameters, on the basis of prior knowledge and the available data; estimation of parameter uncertainty and correlation structure; estimation of predictive uncertainty for the assessment of trends and scenario analyses; validation of model structure in relation to residual errors. Moreover the method allows an iterative approach between hypothesis generation and data analysis. The method is applied to perform a regression and uncertainty analysis of the model PCLake on data from an 18-lake Dutch survey. PCLake is a dynamic nutrient-ecosystem model with a closed nutrient budget, comprising one water and one sediment layer. The model was run until steady state was reached and results were compared to summer-averaged field data from the survey. The output variables selected are chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus concentrations. The analysis was done for three selected parameters, considered uniformly distributed within predefined ranges. Posterior distributions were calculated for each lake on the basis of 125 three-parameter combinations. The residual error of the prediction of chlorophyll-a was reduced from a factor of 3.8 on the basis of the prior uncertainty analysis down to a factor of 2.3 after regression on both variables. For total P concentrations these factors were 1.4 before regression and 1.5 afterwards, hence a small trade-off to match chlorophyll levels. The prior uncertainty factor of mean chlorophyll predictions was reduced from 1.9 before regression to 1.1 after regression on both outputs, while for mean total P predictions these factors were 1.1 and 1.05, respectively. The conclusion can be drawn that chlorophyll-a is particularly sensitive to the three parameters, while total P is determined to a large extent by the lake-specific input parameters. The posterior parameter distributions reflected these differences in sensitivity. Painwise correlations between parameters were low. Analysis of systematic and case-specific deviations between model regression and data helps to identify other critical parameters and possible structural modifications.																			0304-3800					MAR	1995	78	1-2					83	99		10.1016/0304-3800(94)00119-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)00119-3													WOS:A1995QJ25300010

Surface energy fluxes measured during a single summer day at six fixed sites in the NOPEX area, representing agricultural fields, boreal forests and lakes, were used for verification. Both, in-situ field measurements and the HIRLAM simulation indicated that the Bowen ratio over forests was about twice as large as that of adjacent agricultural fields. This difference could be explained by the more effective turbulent mixing and larger surface resistance associated with the forest, thus making the sensible heat flux relatively large there. The use of initial soil moisture from a routine hydrological model gave improved agreement with measured surface fluxes and radiosonde temperature and humidity profiles compared to initialising from routine HIRLAM surface data. The differences in heat fluxes between the various surface types were also demonstrated by airborne flux measurements flown along a track at a height of ca. 100 m above the terrain. Modelled heat fluxes along the flight track were considerably smoothed due to the grid resolution used, e.g. the effect of a lake in reducing grid-averaged sensible heat flux could only be weakly detected, because the lake surface represented only 10% of the grid area. When the proportion of a contrasting surface type (lake) was altered from 10 to 100%, the surface fluxes calculated for the lake surface were almost unchanged; the results of the comparison did not provide evidence that more complex aggregation schemes for heat fluxes than straightforward area-weighted averaging would be required. The hourly variation of the modelled and simulated heat fluxes during the day studied could not be directly compared, because the simulated cloudiness did not exactly match that observed at the field sites. When the simulated net radiation was replaced with direct measurements, the model-based estimates of sensible and latent heat fluxes were closer to the corresponding field measurements. The divergence of sensible heat flux with height, as inferred from the tower measurements made over the forest, were supported by the aircraft measurements and the HIRLAM simulations.

To the Issue of the Age of the Terrace Complexes of the Chuya and Katun Rivers, Russian Altai: Should the Sartan Cryochron Be Excluded from the Epochs of Ice-Dammed Lakes and Cataclysmic Outburst Floods?	STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOLOGICAL CORRELATION												The upcoming edition of new stratigraphic scheme of Quaternary deposits of the Altai-Sayan mountain province is based on the concept of cataclysmic draining of the Pleistocene ice-dammed lakes that occurred prior to 90 ka (MIS-5 and earlier). Our geochronological (OSL, C-14) and paleontological data argue against excluding the Sartansky cryochron (MIS-2) from the epochs of the Altai glaciogenic fluvial catastrophes. The last cataclysmically drained ice-dammed lake in the Chuya Depression existed after 37 ka. The Kurai Depression during MIS-2 was filled with water already by 25 ka and was drained at similar to 19-16 ka. Draining of the last ice-dammed lake in the Kurai Basin correlates with the onset of the formation of the section of catafluvial-lacustrine cyclites in the Inya River valley (a right tributary of the Katun River) at 17-16 ka (MIS-2). Previously, this section was suggested as a parastratotype of the Saldzhar catafluvial deposits accumulated during MIS-5 in the new edition of the Altai-Sayan stratigraphic scheme. OSL dates (16-12 ka) were obtained for deposits at the margin of the 70-m "Saldzhar" terrace of the Katun River upstream of the mouth of the Chuya River. The paleontological findings of lacustrine fauna in situ allow us to reconsider the concept of the exclusively catafluvial genesis of the Saldzhar deposits of the 60-m terrace of the Katun River, near the mouth of its left tributary, the Sema River. The OSL date (32 ka) of deposits at the base of this terrace indicates the onset of its formation not earlier than the end of MIS-3. The section proposed as the stratotype of the post-Saldzhar Maly Yaloman alluvium with the age 90 ka does not meet the requirements of the Stratigraphic Code, because the contact with the Saldzhar deposits has not been revealed here and genesis of deposits is controversial. At present, C-14 and OSL dates of the Saldzhar sequence and post-Saldzhar alluvium form two non-overlapping clusters, older than 90 and 35-12 ka, which can be connected both with methodological features of age dating and with insufficient geological knowledge. Only one of the eight IRSL and OSL dates obtained for Inya sequence deposits, which compose high (up to 300 m) bars in the Chuya and Katun river valleys, falls within the MIS-6 time, which is insufficient to establish its age as MIS-6 and older. To make correct stratigraphic reconstructions, it is necessary not only to expand a dataset obtained by different geochronological methods but also to study the dated deposits using a complex of geological methods.

J	Tingate, PR; Duddy, IR				Tingate, PR; Duddy, IR			The thermal history of the eastern Officer Basin (South Australia): evidence from apatite fission track analysis and organic maturity data	TECTONOPHYSICS					9th International Conference on Fission Track Dating and Thermochronology	FEB 06-11, 2000	LOME, AUSTRALIA					The eastern Officer Basin in South Australia contains a Neoproterozoic to Devonian succession overlain by relatively thin < 500 m) Permian, Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits. Within the basin fill, there are several major unconformities representing uncertain amounts of crosion. Three of these surfaces are associated with regional deformational events. Regional unconformities formed between 560 and 540 Ma. (Petermann Ranges Orogeny), approximately 510-490 Ma (Delamerian Orogeny), 370-300 Ma (Alice Springs Orogeny), 260-150 Ma; and 95-40 Ma. AFTA(R) results from 13 samples of Neoproterozoic, Cambrian and Permian sedimentary rocks in five wells (Giles-1, Manya-2, -5 and -6 and Lake Maurice West-1) show clear evidence for a number of distinct thermal episodes. Results from all samples are consistent with cooling from the most recent thermal episode beginning at some time between 70 and 20 Ma (Maastrichtian-Miocene). ATTA results from Giles-1 indicate at least two pre-Cretaceous thermal episodes with cooling beginning between 350 and 250 Ma (Carboniferous-Permian) and between 210 and 110 Ma (Late Triassic-Albian). Results from Manya-2, -5 and -6 and Lake Maurice West-1 show evidence for at least one earlier higher temperature event, with cooling from elevated paleotemperatures beginning between 270 and 200 Ma (Late Permian to Late Triassic). These episodes can be correlated with other cooling/erosional events outside the study area, and the AFTA-derived paleotemperatures are consistent with kilometre-scale erosion for each of the episodes identified. Integration of the AFTA data with organic thermal maturation indicators (MPI) in the Manya and Giles-1 wells suggests that the Cambrian and Neoproterozoic successions in the northern part of the study area reached peak maturation prior to the Permian, while limited data from Lake Maurice West-1 allows peak maturation to have occurred as young as the Late Permian to Late Triassic thermal episode revealed by AFTA. The approach outlined in this study is relevant to all ancient basins as it emphasises the importance of understanding events associated with neighbouring regions. The thermal history of the Officer Basin, as with most other ancient basins, has been strongly affected by significant tectonic events throughout its history, even though younger deposits are not preserved in the basin itself. The recognition of these younger events, and the implications of these events for the depositional history, is important as it allows identification of the best regions for preservation of early generated hydrocarbons, and in some cases, suggests areas where generation of hydrocarbons could have occurred more recently than previously thought.

The delta is characterized by ice-rich permafrost landscapes and consists of geologically and geomorphologically diverse terraces covered with tundra vegetation and of active floodplains, featuring approximately 6500 km of channels and over 30 000 lakes. Because of its broad landscape and habitat diversity, the delta is a biodiversity hotspot with high numbers of nesting and breeding migratory birds, fish, caribou, and other mammals and was designated a State Nature Reserve in 1995. Characterizing plant composition, aboveground biomass, and application of field spectroscopy was a major focus of a 2018 expedition to the delta. These field data collections were linked to Sentinel-2 satellite data to upscale local patterns in land cover and associated habitats to the entire delta. Here, we describe multiple field datasets collected in the Lena Delta during summer 2018 including foliage projective cover (Shevtsova et al., 2025, 10.1594/PANGAEA.935875), aboveground biomass (Shevtsova et al., 2023, 10.1594/PANGAEA.956067; Shevtsova et al., 2023, 10.1594/PANGAEA.935923), and hyperspectral field measurements (Runge et al., 2022, 10.1594/PANGAEA.945982). We further describe a detailed Sentinel-2 satellite image-based classification of habitats for the central Lena Delta (Landgraf et al., 2025a, 10.1594/PANGAEA.945057; Landgraf et al., 2025b, 10.1594/PANGAEA.945056; Landgraf et al., 2025c, 10.1594/PANGAEA.945055; Landgraf et al., 2025d, 10.1594/PANGAEA.945054), an upscaled classification for the entire Lena Delta (Lisovski et al., 2022, 10.1594/PANGAEA.946407), and the test data set for accuracy assessment (Heim et al., 2025, 10.5281/zenodo.14731823) and a synthesis product for disturbance regimes (Heim and Lisovski, 2023, 10.5281/zenodo.7575691) in the delta that is based on the classification, the described datasets, and field expertise. We present context and detailed methods of these openly available datasets and show how their combined use can improve our understanding of the rapidly changing Arctic tundra system. The new Lena Delta habitat classification represents a first baseline against which future observations can be compared. The link between such detailed habitat classifications and disturbance regime may provide a better understanding of how Arctic lowland landscapes will respond to climate change and how this will impact land surface processes.

New pollen and sedimentation rate studies, combined with existing tree-ring data, submerged stump ages, and lake-level evidence, demonstrate that the LHDP was the driest Great Basin climate within the last 6,000 years-more extreme than the well-known Medieval Climatic Anomaly. New evidence reported here documents that most Great Basin archaeological sites south of 40 degrees N latitude were abandoned during the long dry phase of the LHDP (3100-2200 cal BP), sometimes reoccupied during a wet interval (2200-2000 cal BP), and abandoned again during the most extreme drought (2000-1800 cal BP). Even in the face of epic drought, this is a story of remarkable survivance by some people who adjusted to their drought-stricken landscape where they had lived for millennia. Some moved on, but other resilient foragers refused to abandon their homeland, taking advantage of glacier-fed mountain springs with cooler alpine temperatures and greater moisture retention at high altitude, a result of early Neoglaciation conditions across many Great Basin ranges, despite epic drought conditions in the lowlands. El Periodo Seco del Holoceno Tardio, una megasequia milenaria (3100-1800 cal aP), suministro inesperados desafios y oportunidades para las comunidades indigenas de la Gran Cuenca Central (Estados Unidos). Nuevos estudios palinologicos y de tasas de sedimentacion, junto con datos existentes sobre dendrocronologia, las edades de troncos sumergidos y evidencia de niveles de los lagos, demuestran que el Periodo Seco del Holoceno Tardio fue la peor sequia experimentada en la Gran Cuenca Central dentro de los ultimos 6.000 anos-mas extrema que la famosa Anomalia Climatica Medieval. Nueva evidencia presentada aqui demuestra que la mayoria de los yacimientos arqueologicos de la Gran Cuenca al sur de la latitud 40 degrees N fueron abandonados durante la larga sequia del Periodo Seco del Holoceno Tardio (3100-2200 cal aP), a veces ocupados de nuevo durante un intervalo lluvioso (2200-2000 cal aP), y abandonados otra vez durante la etapa mas extrema de la sequia (2000-1800 cal aP). Aun frente a esta epica sequia, esta es una extraordinaria historia de supervivencia. Este paisaje atormentado por sequia nunca fue completamente abandonado, en parte porque recolectores resilientes se aprovecharon de los manantiales alpinos alimentados de glaciares; estos perduraron debido a temperaturas alpinas mas frias que fomentaron una mayor retencion de humedad en alta elevacion como resultado de condiciones Neoglaciales tempranas a traves de muchas cordilleras de la Gran Cuenca, en contraste con las condiciones de sequia epicas en las tierras bajas.					; Kennett, Douglas/I-7613-2015	Thomas, David/0000-0003-2724-6345; Harper, Thomas Kelley/0000-0002-4969-1653													0002-7316	2325-5064				JUL	2023	88	3					402	418		10.1017/aaq.2023.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2023.37													WOS:001124044200002
J	Gunkel, G; Casallas, J				Gunkel, G; Casallas, J			Limnology of an equatorial high mountain lake - Lago San Pablo, Ecuador: The significance of deep diurnal mixing for lake productivity	LIMNOLOGICA												Equatorial high mountain takes are a special type of lake occurring mainly in the South American Andes as well as in Central Africa and Asia. They occur at altitudes of a few thousand meters above sea level and are cold-water lakes (<20 degreesC). Relatively little is known about them. A long-term limnological study was therefore undertaken at Lake Lago San Pablo, Ecuador to analyze the basic limnological processes of this lake, which has a tendency for eutrophication. Lago San Pablo is spread over an area of 668 hectares, has a maximum depth of 35 m, and is located 2660 m above sea level. Its thermal stratification is a monomictic one, with only 1-2 degreesC difference between the epi- and hypolimnion; overturn is achieved by strong winds during the dry summer period. The stratification phase is characterized by an oxygen deficit in the lower part of the hypolimnion. Besides, strong convective currents occur due to nocturnal cooling, and partial lake mixing was observed during the nocturnal period. This type of lake mixing is called atelomixis, which is characterized by the partial mixing of isolated layers (difference in temperature or ionic content) during stratification. The nutrient level of the lake is quite high: mean P-total concentration = 0.22 mg/l, mean N-total = 1.05 mg/l, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) > 0.01 mg/l, and soluble inorganic nitrogen > 0.2 mg/l. Nitrogen and phosphorus are available in the epilimnion all year round (N-sol, inorg(.) = 0.3 to 1.7 mg/l N, SRP = 0.04 to 0.63 mg/l P). The N/P ratio is sometimes > 14, sometimes < 10, indicating a variability of the limiting nutrient factor. Considering the nutrient level, the phytoplankton biomass is quite low (about 4,000 cells per ml on average; maximum cell number: 13,000 in 1998 and 10,000 in 1999). The mean epilimnic chlorophyll content (Chl a) was 10 mug/l in 1998 and 11 mug/l in 1999, and the maximum Chl a content was 16 and 22 mug/l in 1998 and 1999, respectively. Phytoplankton production can be limited by nutrients, mainly nitrogen, but convective currents can also cause a significant loss of biomass. The lake's euphotic zone is smaller than its epilimnic zoned indicating that light radiation is limiting in the deeper water body, this is caused by a weak thermocline due to destratification by nocturnal cooling, the atelomixis.

The crescent-shaped lake encircles the active volcano Mount Garet (754 m a.s.l.) whose last major eruption occurred in 2009. In 2012 and 2013, we investigated the lake and its effluent river Mbe Solomul. Physicochemical depth profiles revealed a thermocline between 10 and 15 m depth. Oxygen dropped gradually from 7.67 mg liter(-1) at the surface to 0.28 mg liter(-1) at 95 m depth, indicating occasional holomixis. Inflow of ion-rich water from volcanic springs (913 mu S cm(-1)) led to relatively high concentrations of SO42-( 100 mg liter-1) and Cl- (60 mg liter(-1)) throughout the water column. Conductivity was highest at the surface (610 mu S cm(-1)), decreased to a minimum of 571 mu S cm(-1) at 60 m depth, and increased slightly to 576 mu S cm(-1) above the sediment, probably due to solution of ions out of volcanic ashes. Surface pH at 7.8 was remarkably lower than measured in 2004 (8.9), possibly as a result of the increased volcanic activity. A Secchi depth of 1.3 m indicated meso- to eutrophic conditions. In contrast, total phosphorus concentration at the surface was relatively low at 11.8 mu g liter(-1). In total 47 phytoplankton taxa were identified, of which most occurred in the littoral area. Open water was dominated by the filamentous green alga Planctonema lauterbornii and the coccoid desmid Staurastrum depressiceps var. gracilis. Total phytoplankton biomass of 1.06 mg liter(-1) in the epilimnion reflected the mesotrophic character of the lake. The ciliate assemblage included euplanktonic taxa (Halteria, Mesodinium, Coleps, and Stentor) that are commonly detected in temperate and tropical lakes. The zooplankton community was dominated by the copepod Thermocyclops crassus macrolasius, which reached a maximum abundance of 138 ind. liter(-1) at 5 m depth. The littoral was characterized by a dense macrophyte belt consisting predominantly of Chara australis and Ceratophyllum demersum. The vegetation limit was found at 4.8 m mean depth. Two freshwater eel species, Anguilla megastoma and A. marmorata, were the only fishes found in the lake, feeding exclusively on macrozoobenthos. In the effluent river the largest Anguilla obscura hitherto reported in literature was caught (129 cm), showing that these ecosystems are a habitat of primary importance to Pacific eels.					; Schabetsberger, Robert/AAE-8038-2020; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018	Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737; Sonntag, Bettina/0000-0001-7065-522X; Tambets, Meelis/0000-0003-1620-5396; Schabetsberger, Robert/0000-0001-7859-6690; 													0030-8870	1534-6188				APR	2015	69	2					165	180		10.2984/69.2.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.2984/69.2.3													WOS:000357538700003
J	DIEHL, S				DIEHL, S			FISH PREDATION AND BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE - THE ROLE OF OMNIVORY AND HABITAT COMPLEXITY	ECOLOGY												In population models, omnivorous predation (i.e., predation on > 1 trophic level) generally has a destabilizing influence, whereas habitat heterogeneity tends to stabilize both predatory and competitive interactions. I experimentally evaluated the impact of a native omnivorous predator and of habitat structural complexity on the structure of a freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate community. Perch (Perca fluviatilis) were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, size structure, and diversity as well as gut contents of perch were monitored over a 2-mo summer period. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively during the whole experiment, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Insecta: Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity (Shannon evenness and Shannon diversity) of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (i.e., potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. The results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. Perch may have affected nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores simultaneously through direct consumption and through indirect release from invertebrate predation, which could explain the lack of a perch effect on nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores. Complex interactions between the omnivorous predator, intermediate consumers, and resource species (macroinvertebrate herbivores and detritivores) may explain the relationship between perch density and macroinvertebrate diversity. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities.

J	REIBLE, DD; OUIMETTE, JR; SHAIR, FH				REIBLE, DD; OUIMETTE, JR; SHAIR, FH			ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT OF VISIBILITY DEGRADING POLLUTANTS INTO THE CALIFORNIA MOJAVE DESERT	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Three atmospheric tracer experiments using SF6 and fine aerosol measurements were conducted in California to determine the relative impact of pollutant sources on visibility in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles and the southern San Joaquin Valley in a portion of the Mojave Desert. Dilution ratios calculated for SF6 and various gaseous and aerosol chemical species were used to indicate atmospheric transformation processes between source and receptor. The evolution of the aerosol S mass distribution resulting from transport and transformation was measured. The SF6 data were compared with predictions based upon the Gaussian dispersion model. SF6 released in the San Fernando Valley impacted the southern Mojave Desert including the towns of Palmdale and Adelanto. SF6 released at Oildale in the southern San Joaquin Valley directly impacted the northern Mojave Desert including the towns of Mojave and China Lake. Some SF6 released in the San Joaquin Valley was also detected in the southern Mojave Dsert. SF6 was diluted by factors of only 2-3 during passage over the mountains separating the source and receptor areas. SF6 dispersion during the San Fernando Valley experiment could be modeled with the Gaussian plume model if the experimentally determined mixing height, transport speed and plume trajectory were used and the stability class was chosen to give good agreement with the data. A simple Gaussian plume model could not provide an adequate description of the San Joaquin Valley test because of the complexities of the wind reversal that occurred during the transition from morning to afternoon flow conditions during this test. Dilution rates for conserved fine aerosols between Oildale and China Lake were .apprx. 3, in excellent agreement with the SF6 data. The timing of the diurnal degradation in visibility at China Lake coincided with the arrival of SF6, indicating that the southern San Joaquin Valley was the source of visibility degrading aerosol. The aerosol S mass distribution was essentially conserved between Oildale and China Lake and substantially different from Los Angeles-Palm Springs S mass distributions. Pollutants from the southern San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles Basin impacted the Mojave Desert during their transport eastward by the predominantly westerly summertime winds; consequently, both plumes should be taken into account when considering the impact of southern California pollutants upon the southwestern USA.

J	Krueger, CC; Perkins, DL; Mills, EL; Marsden, JE				Krueger, CC; Perkins, DL; Mills, EL; Marsden, JE			Predation by alewives on lake trout fry in Lake Ontario: Role of an exotic species in preventing restoration of a native species	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					1994 International Conference on Restoration of Lake Trout in the Laurentian Great Lakes (RESTORE)	JAN 10-14, 1994	ANN ARBOR, MI	Great Lake Fishery Commiss, Board Tech Experts				Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) restoration efforts in Lake Ontario have resulted in an abundance of spawning fish of hatchery-origin, bur virtually no detectable natural recruitment. One explanation has been predation by non-native alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) on lake trout fry. The purpose of this study was to determine if alewives could be important predators on lake trout fry. In the laboratory, fry behavior was examined to ascertain when fry would be present in the water column during a 24-hour period and to determine the acceptability of fry as food for alewives. In aquaria exposed to ambient light regimes, sac fry activity in the water column was much greater at night than during daylight hours (P < 0.001). In laboratory tanks, lake trout fry (15-34 mm) were aggressively eaten by alewives (118-175 mm). Field studies were conducted at Stony Island Reef Lake Ontario in 1989-1993 to determine whether alewives and fry were present at the same time on the reef if alewives fed when on the reef and if alewives fed upon naturally-produced lake trout fry. Lake trout fry captured in traps indicated that sac and emergent fry were available as prey from the middle of April through the third week of May. The first capture of alewives in gillnets set adjacent to the fry traps was typically in early May and corresponded to the peak capture of sac fry in traps. Food was present in 86% of the 1,239 alewives captured after sunset over the 5-year period. Ten lake trout fry were found in 6 of the 62 alewives captured after sunset on 20 May 1993 at Stony Island Reef; no fry were found in alewife stomachs caught on other dates. Predation by alewives might have caused substantial mortality of lake trout fry from spawning areas in Lake Ontario where alewives were abundant and could also be an important source of mortality in similar areas of Lakes Michigan and Huron. Increased stocking of predatory salmonids to suppress the alewife could enhance survival of fry and speed restoration in Lake Ontario, but suppression seems unlikely under current strategies to manage the alewife as forage for non-native salmonids. In this context, lakewide goals should be re-focused on restoration in localized areas where alewives do not congregate during the spring and predation on lake trout fry would be minimal-such as at offshore shoals.

However, there are exceptions. A multibeam sonar survey at the northern end of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, adjacent to the southern edge of the Gulf of Papua, mapped a shelf valley system up to 220 m deep that extends for more than 90 km across the continental shelf. This is the deepest shelf valley yet found in the Great Barrier Reef and is well below the maximum depth of fluvial incision that could have occurred under a - 120 m, eustatic sea level low-stand, as what occurred on this margin during the last ice age. These valleys appear to have formed by a combination of reef growth and tidal current scour, probably in relation to a sea level at around 30-50 in below its present position. Tidally incised depressions in the valley floor exhibit closed bathymetric contours at both ends. Valley floor sediments are mainly calcareous muddy, gravelly sand on the middle shelf, giving way to well-sorted, gravely sand containing a large relict fraction on the outer shelf. The valley extends between broad platform reefs and framework coral growth, which accumulated through the late Quaternary, coincides with tidal current scour to produce steep-sided (locally vertical) valley walls. The deepest segments of the valley were probably the sites of lakes during the last ice age, when Torres Strait formed an emergent landbridge between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Numerical modeling predicts that the strongest tidal currents occur over the deepest, outer-shelf segment of the valley when sea level is about 40-50 m below its present position. These results are consistent with a Pleistocene age and relict origin of the valley. Based on these observations, we propose a new conceptual model for the formation of tidally incised shelf valleys. Tidal erosion on meso- to macro-tidal, rimmed carbonate shelves is enhanced during sea level rise and fall when a tidal, hydraulic pressure gradient is established between the shelf-lagoon and the adjacent ocean basin. Tidal flows attain a maximum, and channel incision is greatest, when a large hydraulic pressure gradient coincides with small channel cross sections. Our tidal-incision model may explain the observation of other workers, that sediment is exported from the Great Barrier Reef shelf to the adjacent ocean basins during intermediate (rather than last glacial maximum) low-stand, sea level positions.

Here we present the results from a 5 year (2006-2010) monitoring program using pollen traps placed at different heights from ground level up to 60 m and surface soil samples in a mixed coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved woodland in the Changbai mountains, northeastern China. The pollen percentages and pollen influx from the traps have very similar characteristics to the highest values for Betula, Fraxinus, Quercus and Pinus, among the tree taxa and Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae and Asteraceae among the herb taxa. Pollen influx values vary significantly with height and show major differences between three distinct layers, above-canopy (>= 32 m), within the trunk layer (8 <= 32 m) and on the ground (0 m). These differences in pollen influx are explained by differences in (i) the air flows in each of these layers and (ii) the fall speed of pollen of the various taxa. We found that the pollen recorded on the ground surface is a good representation of the major part of the pollen transported in the trunk space of the woodland. Comparison of the pollen influx values with the theoretical, calculated "characteristic pollen source area" (CPSA) of 12 selected taxa indicates that the pollen deposited on the ground surface of the woodland is a fair representation with 85-90 % of the total pollen deposited at a wind speed of 2.4 m s(-1) coming from within ca. 1-5 km for Pinus and Quercus, ca. 5-10 km for Ulmus, Tilia, Oleaceae and Betula, ca. 20-40 km for Fraxinus, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Populus and Salix, and ca. 30-60 km for Artemisia; it is also a good representation with 90-98 % of the total pollen deposited coming from within 60 km at a wind speed of 2.4 ms(-1), or 100 km at a wind speed: 6 m s(-1), for the 12 selected taxa used in the CPSA calculation. Furthermore, comparison with the vegetation map of the area around the sampling site shows that the pollen deposited on the ground represents all plant communities which grow in the study area within 70 km radius of the sampling site. In this study, the pollen percentages obtained from the soil surface samples are significantly biased towards pollen taxa with good preservation due to thick and robust pollen walls. Therefore, if mosses are available instead, soil samples should be avoided for pollen studies, in particular for the study of pollen-vegetation relationships, the estimation of pollen productivities and quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation. The results also indicate that the existing model of pollen dispersal and deposition, Prentice's model, provides a fair description of the actual pollen dispersal and deposition in this kind of woodland, which suggests that the application of the landscape reconstruction algorithm would be relevant for reconstruction of this type of woodland in the past.

J	Weinbauer, MG; Hofle, MG				Weinbauer, MG; Hofle, MG			Size-specific mortality of lake bacterioplankton by natural virus communities	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The potential effect that viral lysis has on the cell size distribution of bacterioplankton was investigated during late summer stratification in Lake Plusssee, Germany. Size-specific bacterial mortality due to viral lysis was estimated from in situ samples by a transmission electron microscopy based examination of visibly infected cells (VIC) and in an experiment with varying concentrations of the natural virus community. In all depth layers the highest percentage of cells was found in a cell length class that was smaller for the entire bacterial community (0.3-0.6 mu m) than for VIC (0.6-0.9 mu m). For cells <2.4 mu m the highest frequency of VIC (FVIC) was detected in the size classes 0.6-0.9 and 0.9-1.2 mu m and the FVIC was high in the size classes 1.2-1.5 (all depth layers) and 1.5-1.8 mu m (meta- and hypolimnion). The estimated mortality due to viral lysis in these size classes was significant with maxima of 29 to 55% in the epilimnion, 30 to 59% in the metalimnion and 56 to 107% in the hypolimnion. In all depth layers the FVIC of bacteria <0.3 mu m in length was ca 30% of that averaged for the entire bacterial community, and in the experiment the percentage of cells <0.3 mu m was highest in enclosures with high viral activity. In the experiment the average cell size was smaller in enclosures with high than in that with low viral activity. The data demonstrate that being small could be a strategy of cells to reduce mortality due to viral lysis probably by reducing the contact rates with viruses. Thus, viral lysis could be one of the mechanisms keeping the cell size small in aquatic ecosystems. In oxic water cells in the largest size class (>2.4 mu m) were not infected with viruses, and in enclosures with epilimnetic lake water the percentage of cells >2.4 mu m was highest in enclosures with highest viral abundance, suggesting that resistance against infection favored large cells. However, in the meta- and hypolimnion the FVIC was high for cells >2.4 mu m and, since the burst size increased with bacterial cell size, lysis of large cells could contribute significantly to viral production. Also, a major portion of biomass was found in cells >2.4 mu m. The finding that viral lysis is size-specific and can affect the cell size distribution of bacteria in lake water has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms which regulate bacterial production and nutrient cycling in pelagic environments.

Three transplantations with biomasses of 274, 407, and 401 g dry weight m(-2) were established six weeks before the measurements in late August. Net photosynthesis and apparent dark respiration was measured from the change of CO2 concentration inside polycarbonate chambers with diameter of 0.455 m and volume of 0.207 m(3). Altogether 50 experiments for determination of CO2 influx rates and 24 for efflux rates were run without any pre-treatment to higher CO2 and each of them lasted 20-30 min. The response of net photosynthesis of E. fluviatile to CO2 enrichment was less clear than the response to temperature or irradiance. Nevertheless, the stands showed an increase of ca. 25 % in net photosynthesis when the CO2 concentration in air was increased from ambient to 500-600 ppm. When the CO2 concentration was > 600 ppm the increase was ca. 60 %. A multilinear regression model combining solar radiation, temperature and CO2 concentration could only explain 46.4 % of the variation in the observed rates of net photosynthesis. The apparent dark respiration was positively correlated with temperature but inversely related to CO2 concentration. When the CO2 concentration was doubled from ambient the stands of E. fluviatile reduced their apparent dark respiration by ca. 50 %. Under higher CO2 concentration E. fluviatile appeared more effective than in the ambient concentration, as the production lost through respiration decreased. When the concentration of atmospheric CO2 was < 500 ppm, 57.5 % of gross production was respired whereas above 500 ppm of CO2 the corresponding proportion was only 34.2 %. As the enrichment with CO2 resulted in decreased respiration rates and it was known from long-term growth and photosynthesis experiments that neither shoot growth in length in E. fluviatile is stimulated by higher CO2 concentrations nor do the stands show down-regulation of photosynthesis after several weeks of CO2 enrichment, it was concluded that the extra carbon fixed was allocated to storage through growth of below-ground biomass.																			0066-1759					DEC	1995	69	5-6					169	176																WOS:A1995TU37100004

Species found were: C. erraticus (Rud., 1809), C. variegatus (Crepl., 1825) and C. platycephalus (Crepl., 1825). The first intermediate host is Valvata piscinalis, the rate of infection was about 3%. Infected snails are sterile and somewhat larger and had a higher mortality rate than non-infected snails. A description is given of the cercaria of C. erraticus from naturally and experimentally infected snails. Differences are noted with the description of the cercaria of C. erraticus from America. It seems doubtful that both are conspecific. Metacercariae occured especially in fish from the IJsselmeer, a freshwater lake newly formed after the closing of the Zuiderzee in 1932. Metacercariae of C. erraticus were found in Osmerus eperlanus and Salmo gairdneri, mainly in the pericardium. C. variegatus was found in Gymnocephalus cernua, Stizostedion lucioperca and Perca fluviatilis, mainly on the wall of the swimbladder. C. platycephalus was found in G. cernua, S. lucioperca, Abramis brama, Leuciscus cephalus and for a small percentage also in O. eperlanus and Rutilus rutilus, especially in pericardium and mesentery. The rate of infection of O. eperlanus with C. erraticus and G. cernua with C. variegatus and C. platycephalus in the IJsselmeer amounted to nearly 100%, with many tens of cysts per fish. In other inland waters this rate was low or zero. Infected fish from the IJsselmeer may enter the Wadden Sea, especially in winter, by the discharge of water from the IJsselmeer through the sluices. Some fish-eating birds, in particular gulls, acted as final hosts. Heavy infections with C. variegatus and C. platycephalus were often lethal. C. erraticus seems less pathogenic. Repeated infection may lead to some kind of immunity. The small C. erraticus and the larger C. variegatus live in the same part of the intestine, while the large C. platycephalus lives in the cloaca of the final host. The distribution of the first intermediate host (V. piscinalis) limits the cercariae to large fresh water bodies. From here fish may transport the metacercariae over considerable distances and even to the sea. The distribution of adults through birds is even wider.																			0077-7579						1979	13	2					161	+		10.1016/0077-7579(79)90001-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(79)90001-2													WOS:A1979JQ87200001

The hydrochemical and biogeochemical processes during the deposition of the No center dot rdlinger Ries impact crater lake, which fall in the range of the mid-Miocene Climate Transition, were studied by analysing microcrystalline authigenic carbonates in a drill core succession, using stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in conjunction with biomarkers. These investigations revealed an early sulfidic interval characterized by thiophenes, iso-and anteiso-C15:0 acids derived from sulfate reducing bacteria, and dolomites with low to intermediate delta 13Ccarb values. The subsequent distinctive interval is characterized by extremely 13C-enriched dolomite (delta 13Ccarb up to +20.93 +/- 0.05 parts per thousand V-PDB), decline of iso-and anteiso-C15:0 acids and is rich in an Archaea-derived archaeol that is 13C-enriched (-14.7 parts per thousand), indicating extensive methanogenesis in sulfate-depleted lake porewater during early diagenesis. The sulfate decline results from successive sulfate reduction when replenishment by sulfate-bearing inflow water is limited. The carbonates exhibit enriched 18O due to pronounced evaporation in a long-resided water body and enriched 13C by methanogenesis. A change in provenance of water derived from the sulfur-rich suevite (impact melt-bearing breccia) and crystalline source rocks to the sulfur-poor Bunte Breccia (continuous ejecta blanket) is required. Intermit-tently high Si/Al and Zr/Al at the high delta 13C interval suggests sporadic short-term runoff increase, leading to fluctuating physiochemical lake conditions. A subsequent decline in both delta 13Ccarb and archaeol indicates a decreasing lake level with intermittent subaerial exposure events, supported by bioturbation and mud cracks. The concomitant lake oxygenation is well supported by increasing Pr/Ph ratios and lipids derived from aerobic methanotrophs (13C-depleted 3-methyl-hopanoids). In the youngest unit, allochthonous lignites and biomarkers from lacustrine/soil sources appear, high total sulphur contents and thiophenes recur, and stable C and O isotope values decrease again. These observations suggest another major provenance change of the inflowing solutes, with increasing influx from weathered pyrite-bearing Jurassic claystones. These findings demonstrate that the climatic record expected from the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes of the Ries carbonates is strongly over-printed by hydrochemical and biogeochemical processes due to changing ion influx from substrate rocks, along the course of the successive ejecta erosion and catchment changes. Such an intrinsic control of lacustrine biogeochemical processes is also expected for other hydrologically closed impact crater lake basins, where catchment rocks with distinctively different lithologies are present.					; Thiel, Volker/AAI-2391-2019; Böttcher, Michael/A-6746-2013	Gatjen, Jochen/0000-0002-3455-3020; Bottcher, Michael Ernst/0000-0002-8877-0303; Zeng, Lingqi/0000-0003-2676-4415; Reinhardt, Manuel/0000-0003-0606-9175; Arp, Gernot/0000-0002-0968-7916													0016-7037	1872-9533				DEC 1	2023	362						22	40		10.1016/j.gca.2023.10.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2023.10.013		OCT 2023											WOS:001098798100001

The Neolithic site of Maddalena di Muccia (Umbria-Marche Apennine, Italy): a tip to reconstruct the geomorphological evolution and human occupation during the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The geomorphological evolution of the upper Chienti river basin, during the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, was characterized mainly by numerous landslides, strongly affecting the river dynamics, that produced falls, deviations and in some cases total obstructions with the formation of lakes sometimes extending for some kilometres. Moreover, particularly during the Holocene. phytoclastic and phytohermal travertine deposits were deposited in correspondence of steps along the river bed: one of these deposits, by means of radiocarbon dating, has been dated between 8260 +/- 100 yr BP and 7740 +/- 80 yr BR Stromatolithic travertine is also present at the base of Holocene channels, slightly incised on the top of the upper Pleistocene alluvial plain. The Neolithic site of Maddalena of Muccia is located on an upper Pleistocene alluvial terrace, at the confluence of the two main tributaries of the river, about 400 m a.s.l. Human presence in this alluvial plain zone lasted from the ancient Neolithic to the Roman period, surely in relation to its strategic position, connecting the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian slants of the chain. The richest and most important remains, found at just 50 cm under the field level, belong to the ancient and recent Neolithic and to the Aeneolithic, and have been collocated between the VII and the V millennium BC, using C14. During the archaeological excavations carried out by the Archaeological Superintendence of the Marche region, testimonies reveal a local economy that was primarily based on animal breeding, cereal cultivation, fishing and deforestation. The study has evidenced that the river incision process, usually started in other areas at the beginning of the Holocene, was strictly limited by the presence of steps and barrages that reduced sedimentation flows towards the initial sectors of the valleys within the calcareous Apennine ridge. The generalized deposition of travertine along the riverbeds and within the minor channels that developed at the top of the upper Pleistocene alluvial plains also produced a sort of armature of the riverbed thus limiting further erosion processes. The resumption of linear erosion coincided with the natural erosion of the dams previously caused by landslides, and above all, (starting from about 4500 yr BP) with the rapid decline of the travertine deposition due mainly to climatic conditions.

S	Rosenbaum, JG; Heil, CW	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS			Rosenbaum, Joseph G.; Heil, Clifford W., Jr.	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS		The glacial/deglacial history of sedimentation in Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho	PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF BEAR LAKE, UTAH AND IDAHO, AND ITS CATCHMENT	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Bear Lake, in northeastern Utah and southern Idaho, lies in a large valley formed by an active half-graben. Bear River, the largest river in the Great Basin, enters Bear Lake Valley similar to 15 km north of the lake. Two 4-m-long cores provide a lake sediment record extending back similar to 26 cal k.y. The penetrated section can be divided into a lower unit composed of quartz-rich clastic sediments and an upper unit composed largely of endogenic carbonate. Data from modern fluvial sediments provide the basis for interpreting changes in provenance of detrital material in the lake cores. Sediments from small streams draining elevated topography on the east and west sides of the lake are characterized by abundant dolomite, high magnetic susceptibility ( MS) related to eolian magnetite, and low values of hard isothermal remanent magnetization (HIRM, indicative of hematite content). In contrast, sediments from the headwaters of the Bear River in the Uinta Mountains lack carbonate and have high HIRM and low MS. Sediments from lower reaches of the Bear River contain calcite but little dolomite and have low values of MS and HIRM. These contrasts in catchment properties allow interpretation of the following sequence from variations in properties of the lake sediment: (1) ca. 26 cal ka-onset of glaciation; (2) ca. 26-20 cal ka-quasi-cyclical, millennial-scale variations in the concentrations of hematite-rich glacial flour derived from the Uinta Mountains, and dolomite-and magnetite-rich material derived from the local Bear Lake catchment (reflecting variations in glacial extent); (3) ca. 20-19 cal ka-maximum content of glacial flour; (4) ca. 19-17 cal ka-constant content of Bear River sediment but declining content of glacial flour from the Uinta Mountains; (5) ca. 17-15.5 cal ka-decline in Bear River sediment and increase in content of sediment from the local catchment; and (6) ca. 15.5-14.5 cal ka-increase in content of endogenic calcite at the expense of detrital material. The onset of glaciation indicated in the Bear Lake record postdates the initial rise of Lake Bonneville and roughly corresponds to the Stansbury shoreline. The lake record indicates that maximum glaciation occurred as Lake Bonneville reached its maximum extent ca. 20 cal ka and that deglaciation was under way while Lake Bonneville remained at its peak. The transition from siliciclastic to carbonate sedimentation probably indicates increasingly evaporative conditions and may coincide with the climatically driven fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline. Although lake levels fluctuated during the Younger Dryas, the Bear Lake record for this period is more consistent with drier conditions, rather than cooler, moister conditions interpreted from many studies from western North America.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2450-8				2009	450						247	261		10.1130/2009.2450(11)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2450(11)													WOS:000271276500012

Originating from the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4.5, ELM has been under active development, with added new features and functionality, including plant hydraulics, radiation-topography interaction, subsurface multiphase flow, and more explicit land use and management practices. This study integrates ELM v2.1 with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF; WRF-ELM) model through a modified Lightweight Infrastructure for Land Atmosphere Coupling (LILAC) framework, enabling affordable high-resolution regional modeling by leveraging ELM's innovative features alongside WRF's diverse atmospheric parameterization options. This framework includes a top-level driver for variable communication between WRF and ELM and Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) caps for the WRF atmospheric component and ELM workflow control, encompassing initialization, execution, and finalization. Importantly, this LILAC-ESMF framework demonstrates a more modular approach compared to previous coupling efforts between WRF and land surface models. It maintains the integrity of ELM's source code structure and facilitates the transfer of future developments in ELM to WRF-ELM.To test the ability of the coupled model to capture land-atmosphere interactions over regions with a variety of land uses and land covers, we conducted high-resolution (4 km) WRF-ELM ensemble simulations over the Great Lakes region (GLR) in the summer of 2018 and systematically compared the results against observations, reanalysis data, and WRF-CTSM (WRF coupled with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model). In general, the coupled WRF-ELM model has reasonably captured the spatial distribution of surface state variables and fluxes across the GLR, particularly over the natural vegetation areas. The evaluation results provide a baseline reference for further improvements in ELM in the regional application of high-resolution weather and climate predictions. Our work serves as an example to the model development community for expanding an advanced land surface model's capability to represent fully-coupled land-atmosphere interactions at fine spatial scales. The development and release of WRF-ELM marks a significant advancement for the ELM user community, providing opportunities for fine-scale regional representation, parameter calibration in coupled mode, and examination of new schemes with atmospheric feedback.

J	GEE, JHR; DUIGAN, CA				GEE, JHR; DUIGAN, CA			THE LIMNOLOGY OF LAC DIFNI (HIGH-ATLAS-MOUNTAINS, MOROCCO), AN UNUSUALLY PRODUCTIVE MOUNTAIN LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lac d'Ifni (surface area 30 ha, z(max) 60m, altitude 2300m) lies in a catchment comprised of Precambrian igneous rocks in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Previously described as a typical oligotrophic lake, it was also reported to have a warm layer at the base of the hypolimnion which was ascribed to phreatic water supply and drainage. 2. Visits to the lake made in May/June and September 1990 showed strong thermal stratification but no hypolimnial warm layer. Drainage from the lake is subterranean, through a natural rubble dam, and the water level dropped by at least 7m through the summer. The flushing rate is about 0.6 year(-1) 3. The upper part of the metalimnion and the lower epilimnion were strongly supersaturated with oxygen in Tune, and there was a pH gradient from 7 to 10.5 between the hypolimnion and the epilimnion. These features were less marked in September when planktonic gross primary productivity was estimated to be about 145 mg Cm-2 h(-1). In September the hypolimnion was 38% saturated with oxygen; the areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit between June and September was 0.073 mg O-2 cm(-2) day(-1) Total dissolved phosphate concentrations were 7-14 mu gl(-1) 4. The open water faunal assemblage consisted of Brachionus calyciflorus and Filinia longiseta (Rotifera), Cyclops abyssorum (Copepoda), and stunted Salmo trutta (Pisces). Trout diets were comprised principally of adult copepods and copepodites, which showed diurnal vertical migration, and of algal material apparently scraped from rock surfaces. The dry biomass density of Cyclops was at least 2gm(-2) in June and at least 4.1gm(-2) in September. 5. Tubifex tubifex (Oligochaeta) dominated the benthos below depths of 40 m. Mean dry biomass density was 2.8gm(-2), but ranged from 0.6-8.1gm(-2) between samples. About 50% of the lake bottom is below 40 m depth. 6. The persistent oxygen supersaturation of the euphotic zone, the field estimate of primary productivity, the hypolimnetic oxygen deficit, tl-le biomass of zooplankton and the benthic biomass together indicate that Lac d'Ifni is an unusually productive mountain lake. This high level of productivity may be sustained by nutrient addition through contamination by dust originating outside the catchment, aided by efficient nutrient recycling in the euphotic zone.																			0046-5070					DEC	1993	30	3					447	462		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00828.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00828.x													WOS:A1993MN34700011
J	Baumgarten, H; Wonik, T; Kwiecien, O				Baumgarten, H.; Wonik, T.; Kwiecien, O.			Facies characterization based on physical properties from downhole logging for the sediment record of Lake Van, Turkey	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake Van (Turkey) is the 4th largest terminal lake in the world and is located at a key position for climatic reconstruction. The ICDP project PALEOVAN' is a deep-drilling campaign initiated in the summer of 2010 to enhance the understanding of paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental conditions in the Middle East for a period of 550,000 years. Multiple coring of two sites (Northern Basin and Ahlat Ridge) at a water depth of up to 360 m has been performed. The sedimentary record is mainly composed of clayey silts and tephra deposits that were supplied by four volcanic sources: 1) the Silphan volcano, located on the northern shore, 2) the Nemrut volcano, 15 km west of the westernshore, 3) the Incekaya volcano, on the southwestern shore and 4) intralake eruptive centers. The dominant chemical composition of the volcanic sources is known from studies of land deposits. High-quality downhole logs have been acquired from both sites. To construct a continuous lithological profile, 180 m of downhole logging data from the Ahlat Ridge have been analyzed by cluster analysis. To improve the differentiation of the sediments, two elemental intensity profiles from x-ray fluorescence core-scanning (calcium and zirconium) performed on the composite profile core material were added to the cluster analysis. Five cluster units were derived and transformed into three tephra and two clayey silt units. To compare the two clayey silt units with the composite profile from the visual core description (VCD) that showed 15 lithological units, the composite profile was classified into two major groups of lacustrine sediments: banded clayey silts (interpreted as glacial deposits) and laminated clayey silts (interpreted as interglacial deposits). Despite this simplification, no correlation between the two clayey silt units derived from cluster analysis and the banded and laminated clayey silts could be found. The following reasons are proposed: (a) the comparability of the datasets was limited by significant depth shifts of up to 2.5 m between the composite profile based on the VCD and the downhole measurements in hole 2D of the Ahlat Ridge, (b) a correlation was difficult to ascertain from the vertical resolution of the downhole logging data and the extremely detailed core description in mm-scale, (c) mixed signals were obtained because of prevailing thin layers and intercalations of different lithotypes and (d) cluster analysis was difficult to perform because the contrast within the input data is too low (possibly background sedimentation) to distinguish between glacial and interglacial deposits. Tephra units are characterized by contrasting properties and differ mainly in their magnetic susceptibility, spectral gamma ray components (uranium, thorium and potassium) and XRF-intensities of calcium and zirconium. Tephra units have been linked to the dominant volcanic composition of the deposited tephra layers and partly to the volcanic sources. Depth trends are derived with prevailing basaltic deposits in the bottom part (128 m-210 m below lake floor) and are gradually outweighed by the highly differentiated (dacitic and rhyolitic/trachytic) products towards the top of the record.

The quality of the instrumental measurements was controlled by independent methods (TXRF and ICP/MS) and by using reference materials (NIST 1643c and BCR/CRM 414). All the chemical concentrations were very low, which means that all the lakes can be classified as oligotrophic to ultra-oligotrophic. Slightly increased concentrations within the lakes investigated may be attributed to anthropogenic influences from the town of Bariloche in the case of Lake Nahuel Huapi or to the glacial influence of the Upper Manso River, which carries considerable amounts of dissolved salts and suspended particles from the Tronador glacier. The waters are very dilute solutions dominated by calcium, bicarbonates and dissolved silica. The ionic composition is largely below the world average given by Livingstone (1963, in: Horne Al, Goldman CR. Limnology, 2nd ed. USA: McGraw Hill, 1994:576). The Andean-Patagonian lake waters showed concentrations of Cr, Sr, Zn, Cu, Co and Pb that were of the same order as the freshwater world average. The remaining elements (P, S, Si, Fe, Mn, Ni, Na, K, Mg, Ca, As, Cl and Cd) fall below or around the limit for the freshwater world average. With the exception of calcium, which is twice as high as in reference freshwater (Markert B. Inorganic chemical fingerprinting of the environment; reference freshwater, a useful tool for comparison and harmonization of analytical data in freshwater chemistry. Fresenius' Z Anal Chem 1994;349:697-702), the element concentrations (S, Fe, Mg, Na, K and Sr) are lower than in reference freshwater. The phytoplankton biomass was mainly dominated by Dinophyceae in Mascardi and Gutierrez lakes and by Bacillariophyceae in Lake Nahuel Huapi. The phytoplankton shows greater accumulation of the minerals K and Ca, and the essential trace elements (Mg, Fe, Cu and Zn) than the zooplankton. Sulphur occurs in greater concentrations in zooplankton than in phytoplankton, this could be due to higher protein contents. In the case of non-essential elements that are toxic at higher concentrations (As and Pb) it is noticeable that the levels are similar for phyto-and zooplankton. This indicates that these substances are taken up passively from the water and deposited in the organism. In general it can be said that the organisms accumulate all the elements by 100- to 1000-fold in relation of the surrounding environment.

J	Wires, LR; Cuthbert, FJ				Wires, LR; Cuthbert, FJ			Historic populations of the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus): Implications for conservation and management in the 21st century	WATERBIRDS												In North America, the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) is currently abundant, widely distributed across five broad geographic regions, and often perceived as overabundant. In many U.S. states and Canadian provinces, policy makers are pressured to significantly reduce cormorant numbers, primarily to minimize conflicts between cormorants and fish resources. Concurrently, large-scale conservation plans recently developed for birds in the Americas depart from the traditional narrow focus on threatened and endangered species to encompass broader and more representative goals (e.g., Partners in Flight's objective to "keep common birds common"). In recent waterbird conservation initiatives, historic distribution and abundance provide the basis for conservation focus; these initiatives advocate conservation of-birds in natural numbers and natural habitats. To provide a context in which current populations of Double-crested Cormorants can be understood, we reviewed historic and current breeding and wintering records to determine historic distribution (pre-1900), current distribution (1970-1999), and extent of range expansion across North America. Early records suggest Double-crested Cormorants were present in large numbers throughout much of their current range; colonies and flocks much larger than any known in the 1990s are well documented. However, numbers sharply declined through the late 1800s as cormorants were greatly reduced and/or extirpated in many areas. The population partially recovered through at least the mid-1900s, bot experienced a second major decline (hiring the 1950s-1970s. In the late 1970s, a second rebound began across much of the continent; the largest breeding populations (Canadian/U.S. interior, Atlantic Coast < 80% of total) increased from approximately 32,000 pairs in the early 1970s to > 226,000 pairs in the late 1990s. Comparison of historic and current records challenges the opinion that cormorants are currently overabundant, and suggests that perception of overabundance rests oil socio-political rather than biological or ecological factors. For this species, and others that are seen as competitors with humans, limits of human tolerance (i.e. "social carrying capacity") are far narrower than those of biological carrying capacity. Because large numbers have been typical for cormorants historically population targets based on fishery or other objectives derived from human values will likely be readily surpassed, require intensive management, and significantly depart from the concept of conserving birds in natural numbers and natural habitats. Although managing fish-eating birds to benefit fishery yields may increase some fish populations, this approach does not. resolve or address the underlying problems causing current fish population declines across the continent, and is in direct conflict with current broad scale conservation initiatives. To ensure inclusion of cormorants and other fish-eating birds in these conservation plans, the avian conservation community most continue to press for programs based on ecosystem health and process that recognize humans, fish and cormorants as three components of a complex system driven by man), species and dynamic interactions.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2006	29	1					9	37		10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[9:HPOTDC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2006)29[9:HPOTDC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236121700002

N.; Hamilton, Paul B.; Karthick, Balasubramanian			Appraisal of Asian monsoon variability in the Indian subcontinent and East Asia through the Quaternary using diatom records	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Diatom records in tropical settings have been used to appraise paleomonsoons throughout the Quaternary period due to their ubiquitous presence, rapid response, and preservation in sediments. Despite this, diatoms have been rarely used to assess the Asian monsoonal climate. As the Asian monsoon comprises the Indian and East Asian subsystems, it plays a significant role in global hydrological and energy cycles. Keeping global climate in mind, we reviewed the dynamics and causes of Asian monsoon variability (covering major records exclusive from the tropics) on different spatial and temporal scales using diatoms as a proxy record. The data have been compiled from 50 papers spanning fresh and marine sediment archives, covering entire monsoon regimes, predominantly from Southeast Asia. This study classified the data based on various geological periods ranging from the Pleistocene Epoch to the Holocene Meghalayan age (600 ka-300 a BP). Diatom proxies indicate fluctuating hydrological conditions and varying monsoon intensity throughout the Quaternary period and show regional scale coherence for specific climatic events. Diatom records from both inland and marine sediment archives indicate a wet and warm period during the mid-Pleistocene (590-300 kyr) and a cold climate and weakened East Asian monsoon during 300-140 kyr. Through the late Pleistocene period (75 to 15 kyr), monsoonal conditions were intense, wet and warm during the interglacial stages and weaker and dry during glacial stages across South and East Asia. During the Last Glacial Maximum (24.5-18 kyr), the monsoon significantly weakened with cold climatic conditions in southern Asia, and increased precipitation across East Asia. A majority of the published records witnessed an enhanced Asian monsoon and a warm and humid period towards the early to mid -Holocene, with a decline in the monsoon after the mid-Holocene accompanying intermittent intense wetter conditions. Diatom records from the sediment archives at many geographic locations hold signatures of extreme events such as the Younger Dryas cold event around 13.3-11.3 kyr BP, the Medieval Warm Period around 1.3 to 0.8 kyr, and the Little Ice Age in between 0.6 and 0.3 kyr. Further, we indicate that several sites from different monsoon-dominated geographic-climatic zones should be re-investigated with high resolution across spatial and temporal palaeoclimatic periods (including existing databases) with careful diatom taxonomy to strengthen a climatic reconstruction of this monsoon-dominated region of Asia.

J	Marsicano, CA; Mancuso, AC; Palma, RM; Krapovickas, V				Alicia Marsicano, Claudia; Cecilia Mancuso, Adriana; Manuel Palma, Ricardo; Krapovickas, Veronica			Tetrapod tracks in a marginal lacustrine setting (Middle Triassic, Argentina): Taphonomy and significance	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Fossil tetrapod footprints not only provide valuable information about trackmaker paleobiology but also to give insight into details of the depositional conditions of the substrate at the time of imprinting. Therefore, in the present study the mode of formation and taphonomy of footprints in different substrates was used to investigate the gait and walking dynamics of the trackmakers as well as a source of additional information on the environmental conditions of the track-bearing beds during imprinting. The analyzed section corresponds to thick Middle Triassic lacustrine/deltaic deposits of the Ischichuca/Los Rastros Formation (Ischigualasto-Villa Union Basin) that crops out at the Quebrada de Ischichuca in northwestern Argentina. Part of the track-bearing surfaces correspond to the top of sandy distributary channel mouth bars in a distal delta front setting that were exposed along the lake margin during a lake level fall. Cross-cutting relationships observed among ripple-marks, the footprints, and invertebrate traces of a softground suite of the Scoyenia ichnofacies suggest an omission surface. Measured trackway orientations in the sandstones are perpendicular to the paleo-shoreline, with the animals coming and going along the exposed top of the bars, probably for drinking. Laterally, the distal delta front deposits interfinger with track-bearing wackestone beds of palustrine origin deposited in a restricted local embayment lateral to the delta influenced environment. Trackway orientations in the wackestones are, in contrast, consistent with the animals moving nearly parallel to the lake border, probably along a preferred route. Evidences of a relative high groundwater table at the time of imprinting in the track-bearing surfaces are revealed by the well developed rims of extruded sediment and collapsed digits in the studied tracks and the nearly absence of associated desiccation cracks on the same surfaces. Nevertheless, temporary emergence cannot be ruled out when paleosoil formation was probably promoted as can be observed in the microstructure of both sandstones and wackestones. Moreover, footprint preservation in the wackestones might have been enhanced by partial hardening of the trampled surface during subaerial exposure. Combining ichnofossil content and taphonomy with facies analysis we identified in the lower part of the Ischichuca/Los Rastros succession a relatively rapid withdrawal of the water basinward that was probably due to a forced regression during early rifting of basin evolution. Footprints can also provide valuable information about locomotion dynamics and trackmaker behavior. Thus, the sideways deformation observed in the studied footprints, attributed to basal archosaurs and putative basal dinosaurs, can be related to an outward rotation of the foot during the step cycle, a condition that might allied to the development of the parasagittal posture in Archosauria. Besides, the densely trampled surface described herein constitutes the first documented evidence of putative social behavior among therapsid dicynodonts, the most important group of herviborous animals in the early Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems throughout Gondwana.

J	Cottingham, KL; Schindler, DE				Cottingham, KL; Schindler, DE			Effects of grazer community structure on phytoplankton response to nutrient pulses	ECOLOGY												Sensitivity, the magnitude of change following perturbation, and return rate, the rate of recovery, are two key components of ecological stability. We quantified these properties for phytoplankton in lakes using pulsed nutrient loading as the perturbation. Theory predicts that grazer community structure should influence how phytoplankton respond to pulsed nutrient loading. In particular, phytoplankton in lakes with large, effective grazers such as Daphnia are expected to be less sensitive to, but recover more slowly from, nutrient perturbations than phytoplankton in lakes with smaller grazers. We tested these predictions by adding standardized small and large pulses of nutrients (similar to 10 and similar to 100 mu g P/L of epilimnion; with N at an N: P ratio of similar to 25:1 by mass) to two natural ponds with contrasting grazer communities that resulted from the deliberate addition of planktivorous fishes to one pond. Site-specific responses were examined by conducting the experiment in the same ponds over two consecutive summers (1994 and 1995), but switching the fish treatments between years. In both years, phytoplankton in the pond with large-bodied zooplankton grazers were less sensitive to small pulses of nutrients than were phytoplankton in the pond with small grazers, confirming the expectation that large zooplankton can buffer lakes against nutrient perturbations. However, responses to the large nutrient pulse were less consistent: phytoplankton in the pond with large zooplankton were less sensitive to the large perturbation only in 1995. This unexpected result appears to be due mainly to a 2.6 times greater total zooplankton biomass in the pond with small grazers on the day of the large pulse in 1994. Thus, although the presence of large-bodied zooplankton appears to reduce phytoplankton sensitivity to small nutrient pulses, other factors, including zooplankton biomass, need to be incorporated into predictions for phytoplankton responses to large perturbations. Consistent with expectations, larger zooplankton appeared to slow recovery from nutrient perturbations, since the pond with fish and small grazers had faster return rates following the large nutrient pulse in both years of the experiment. Differences in life history traits between small and large species of zooplankton appear to account for these differences in recovery rates. Our results thus provide some support for theoretical expectations that management activities which alter grazer community structure may also affect the stability of phytoplankton communities to nutrient perturbations; additional experiments are needed to confirm the generality of this result.					; Cottingham, Kathryn/H-1593-2012	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; 													0012-9658					JAN	2000	81	1					183	200		10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0183:EOGCSO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0183:EOGCSO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000084913400016
J	TILZER, MM; GIESKES, WW; HEUSEL, R; FENTON, N				TILZER, MM; GIESKES, WW; HEUSEL, R; FENTON, N			THE IMPACT OF PHYTOPLANKTON ON SPECTRAL WATER TRANSPARENCY IN THE SOUTHERN-OCEAN - IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY	POLAR BIOLOGY												Spectral water transparency in the Northern Weddell Sea was studied during Austral spring. The depth of the 1-% surface irradiance level (''euphotic depth'') varied between 35 and 109 m and was strongly influenced by phytoplankton biomass. Secchi depths were non-linearly related to euphotic depth. In phytoplankton-poor water, the most penetrating spectral region was restricted to a relatively narrow waveband in the blue (approximately 488 nm), but the range was broader, between 488 and 525 nm when phytoplankton were abundant. Water transparency in the red spectral range was always low and only to a small extent affected by phytoplankton. Two independent procedures were used to quantify the impact of phytoplankton on spectral water transparency: (1) Regression analysis of spectral in situ vertical light attenuation coefficients in the sea, against coincident chlorophyll concentrations. This method gave chlorophyll-specific light attenuation coefficients; the y-intercept could be interpreted as a measure of light attenuation by pure water plus non-algal material. (2) Spectra of in vivo light absorption derived by spectroscopy, using phytoplankton enriched to varying degrees onto filters. Thus chlorophyll-specific absorption cross-sections were determined. Estimates obtained by both procedures were in close agreement, By integrating over the spectrum of underwater irradiance, in situ chlorophyll-specific absorption cross sections of phytoplankton suspensions, related to all photosynthetically active radiation, were calculated. Light absorption by phytoplankton for photosynthesis is accomplished mainly in the blue spectral range. Also dissolved and particulate organic matter contributed to the attenuation of blue light. Because in water poor in phytoplankton, underwater irradiance was progressively restricted to blue light, chlorophyll-specific absorption cross-sections of phytoplankton, averaged over the spectrum of photosynthetically active irradiance, increased with water depth. In water with elevated phytoplankton biomass, overall light attenuation was generally enhanced. However, because the spectral composition of underwater light changed relatively little with depth, except immediately below the water surface, light absorption cross-sections of phytoplankton changed little below 10 m depth. Vertical differences in the proportions of underwater light absorbed by the phytoplankton community here were mainly dependent on biomass variations. Because of the comparatively small attenuation of blue light by non-algal matter, the efficiency of light harvesting by phytoplankton at any given concentration of chlorophyll in Antractic waters is greater than in other marine regions. At the highest phytoplankton biomass observed by us, as much as 70% of underwater light was available for phytoplankton photosynthesis. When phytoplankton were scarce, < 10% of underwater light was harvested by phytoplankton.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				FEB	1994	14	2					127	136																WOS:A1994MX31700007

Therefore, after the discovery of an almost complete skeleton of the Eemian Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Ja <spacing diaeresis>ger, 1839) in outcrop of palaeolake sediments near Gorz <acute accent>ow Wielkopolski (GW site, GS3 profile), a multi -proxy analysis was conducted for a precise recognition of the environmental and climate changes taking place before, during and after the life of this individual. Comprehensive palaeobotanical investigations of sediments of two palaeolakes lying above each other were performed palynological analysis including NPPs and algal analysis, plant macroremains studies (including wood fragments), as well as palaeozoological analyses of the Cladocera, Chironomidae and Coleoptera. The picture of changes in the environment and climate obtained thanks to the performed analyzes presented in a short way looks as follows. The end of the Wartanian Glaciation (MIS 6) was characterised by the dominance of herbaceous vegetation. Along with the gradually changing climatic conditions, the landscape of the Eemian Interglacial was dominated in sequence by birch, pine, oak (the so-called First Thermal Optimum), hazel forests with linden, hornbeam (Second Thermal Optimum) with a rarely recorded dry oscillation, then spruce with fir and again pine forests. The "older Eemian lake" during this time changed from deep, cold, oligotrophic and carbonate to shallower, cold waters with higher trophy, then deeper with lower trophy, again shallower with peats and dystrophic conditions and finally became terrestrial. The age of the post-Eemian part of the GS3 profile was reinterpreted, recognizing OSL dating as more reliable than radiocarbon dating, determining the age as Early Vistulian. Subsequent stages of this part of profile were characterised by significant cooling and intense development of heaths and peatbogs (MIS 5d), double return of pine and birch forests separated by intrainterstadial cooling (MIS 5c), recooling with dominant herbaceous plants (MIS 5b) and last warming with birch forests (MIS 5a). The "younger Early Vistulian lake " was formed with the rising of the water level. It was shallow, cold, low-trophic, with the water heating up in the summer, which caused trophic increases. Water levels fluctuated. With the progressing terrestrialization, oligotrophy appeared. Each of used proxies reconstructs a fragment of palaeoenvironmental changes on land and/or in the reservoir, registering climatic events on both regional and local scales. However, only the combination of all results allows for a full picture of natural changes.					; Stefaniak, Krzysztof/AAJ-1644-2021; Karpińska-Kołaczek, Monika/HMP-0354-2023; Moskal-del Hoyo, Magdalena/B-2696-2012; Sobczyk, Artur/A-5622-2018; Niska, Monika/F-8363-2017; Hoyo, Magdalena/B-2696-2012; Kołaczek, Piotr/HLX-2920-2023; Stachowicz-Rybka, Renata/OGQ-5168-2025; Hrynowiecka, Anna/E-5661-2019; Kadej, Marcin/E-5916-2018	Stachowicz-Rybka, Renata/0000-0002-0802-0570; Karpinska-Kolaczek, Monika/0000-0002-3249-7408; Moskal-del Hoyo, Magdalena/0000-0003-3632-7227; Sobczyk, Artur/0000-0003-3829-561X; Hrynowiecka, Anna/0000-0002-6878-9007; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAR 20	2024	686						49	82		10.1016/j.quaint.2024.01.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.01.015		MAR 2024											WOS:001214178000001

The black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) is the only crane species that lives on the Tibetan plateau for its entire life. Every year, black-necked cranes routinely migrate to the wetlands on the southern lower plateau and roost at wetland sites. Currently, many roosting-sites are under threat from wetland degradation resulting from human disturbance, and changes in water depths and the landscape environment. To understand how the black-necked crane selects roosting-sites given these influencing factors, we conducted a study in the Caohai wetland in China by comparing and modeling the selection of roosting habitat. The vegetation factors mainly included the vegetation height of the swamp patch where the roosting-site was located (VHP) and the vegetation height in the roosting-site (VHR), and the geographic factors mainly included the height of the nearest hill (HNH) and the visible range (VR). These four factors were first considered by the black-necked cranes when choosing roosting-sites on the lakeshore. The roosting-site selection model of black-necked cranes was fitted as (P = e(Logit(p) )/(1 + e(Logit(p))) Logit(p) = 1.243 + 8.397(VHP) -7.999(VHR) -4.105(HNH) + 1.584(VR)). In the Caohai wetland, black-necked cranes preferred roosting-sites away from human disturbances, such as villages/settlements and roads, and where the distance to main roads was > 1,300 m, the distance to villages/residential areas was > 650 m, the distance to rural/service roads was > 500 m, the relatively open area with surrounding hills had a relative height < 15 m, the visible range area was > 550,000 m(2), and the shallow swamp area had a water depth of < 5 cm with a vegetation height of < 15 cm. Outside the area of the roosting-site, the surrounding vegetation height was 35 cm-60 cm. We believe that human disturbance, not energy savings or heat loss, was the main factor influencing crane roost site selection. We first gathered data about black-necked crane selection of roosting-sites in a highly complex wetland system. Based on our findings, we strongly recommend appropriately managing the habitat patches in the Caohai wetland, which will have implications for the conservation management of overwintering black-necked cranes in wetlands.					khattak, Romaan/JAO-0697-2023; Su, jun/AFD-5510-2022	SU, Haijun/0000-0002-2123-0660; 													1021-5506	1810-522X				SEP 16	2022	61								36	10.6620/ZS.2022.61-36	http://dx.doi.org/10.6620/ZS.2022.61-36								36568819					WOS:001265027700001

EARTHS FUTURE												Lake-effect snow (LES) storms, characterized by heavy convective precipitation downwind of large lakes, pose significant coastal hazards with severe socioeconomic consequences in vulnerable areas. In this study, we investigate how devastating LES storms could evolve in the future by employing a storyline approach, using the LES storm that occurred over Buffalo, New York, in November 2022 as an example. Using a Pseudo-Global Warming method with a fully three-dimensional two-way coupled lake-land-atmosphere modeling system at a cloud-resolving 4 km resolution, we show a 14% increase in storm precipitation under the end-century warming. This increase in precipitation is accompanied by a transition in the precipitation form from predominantly snowfall to nearly equal parts snowfall and rainfall. Through additional simulations with isolated atmospheric and lake warming, we discerned that the warmer lake contributes to increased storm precipitation through enhanced evaporation while the warmer atmosphere contributes to the increase in the storm's rainfall, at the expense of snowfall. More importantly, this shift from snowfall to rainfall was found to nearly double the area experiencing another winter hazard, Rain-on-Snow. Our study provides a plausible future storyline for the Buffalo LES storm, focusing on understanding the intricate interplay between atmospheric and lake warming in shaping the future dynamics of LES storms. It emphasizes the importance of accurately capturing the changing lake-atmosphere dynamics during LES storms under future warming. A lake-effect snow (LES) storm is a heavy snowfall that occurs when a cold dry air mass travels over a relatively warm lake. LES storms have been particularly known to decimate regions downwind of the North American Great Lakes with several meters of snow and millions of dollars in damages. In this study, we use a fully 3D comprehensive lake-land-atmosphere modeling system, along with the Pseudo-Global Warming technique that incorporates large-scale climate changes into our simulation, to investigate how such devastating LES storms could unfold in a warming climate. We used the LES storm that hit Buffalo, New York in November 2022 as a case study. Our results revealed that under a warmer future climate, LES storms can produce a higher precipitation amount by up to 14%. More notably, our results showed a transition in the form of storm precipitation from mostly snowfall to nearly equal parts snowfall and rainfall. The warmer lake in the future was found to be the primary reason behind the increase in precipitation through enhanced evaporation from the lake. The warmer atmosphere in the future explained why rainfall replaced snowfall in the LES storm. Future of lake-effect snow storms is explored using Pseudo-Global Warming with a 3D two-way coupled lake-land-atmosphere modeling system Future climate amplifies storm precipitation via higher lake evaporation and boosts rainfall at snowfall's expense via a warmer atmosphere Lake evaporation plays a critical role in storm precipitation amount and accurately resolving the future lake-atmosphere dynamics is vital					Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; YANG, Zhao/KHD-0504-2024; Hetland, Robert/E-2614-2012; Chakraborty, TC/GRF-2823-2022; Pringle, William/V-9940-2019; Yang, Zhao/D-6960-2019; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014	Hetland, Robert/0000-0001-9531-2119; Chakraborty, TC/0000-0003-1338-3525; Pringle, William/0000-0002-2877-4812; Kayastha, Miraj B/0000-0002-9956-8362; Yang, Zhao/0000-0002-8802-7130; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X														2328-4277				JUN	2024	12	6							e2024EF004622	10.1029/2024EF004622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EF004622													WOS:001251535800001
J	Jordan-Meille, L; Dorioz, JM; Mathieu, N				Jordan-Meille, L; Dorioz, JM; Mathieu, N			An artificial flood to determine the hydrological network's contribution to phosphorus exports in a small rural watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Most of the phosphorus moved from watersheds to surface waterbodies is particulate and its transfer is in-stream processes dependant (Newbold et al., 1983). Phosphorus retention in the hydrological network can be due to settlement, biological consumption, chemical precipitation (Pilleboue and Dorioz, 1986), adsorption (Green et al., 1978) and storage in the interstitial water (Garban er al., 1995). This retention is proportional to phosphorus concentration and is also dependent on hydrology (Dorioz er al., 1989; Svendsen et al., 1995). Inversely, most of the phosphorus is emitted during floods when soil erosion, resuspension of non consolidated stream bed sediments and stream bed erosion occur. The general objective of the work is to study the role of the hydrological network on phosphorus transfer in a small rural watershed during a minor flood. A mass balance between phosphorus input and output in the river (Dorioz et al., 1989) is difficult to establish during rainy periods because of the great number of phosphorus sources and their diffuse emissions. That is why an artificial flood (Casey and Farr, 1982) was experimented, using the addition of water at one location in a small river. The chosen river is located on a small rural watershed (310 ha) in the east of France, near Lake Geneva (Figs 1 and 2). The experimental reach is 300 m long and mostly covered with fine, non consolidated sediments (Fig. 3). There is no point source pollution entering the stream. The dryness of the experimental period allowed an easy increase in the how from 5 to 20 l/s. The peak flow reached corresponds to summer high flows. Due to a high SO,, concentration, the injected water could be traced (Table 1). The strength of injected water (a strong jet of drinking water expelled out of a pipe over 2 h) made turbidity increase at the input point. In the reach (Fig. 3), water was sampled at the extremities (A and D) and at two intermediate places (B and C). Suspended sediments were measured at the four locations so that zones of resuspension and settlement could be detected. Total phosphorus, soluble phosphorus (<0.7 mu m), conductivity and anions (Cl, SO4) were measured at the entry and the exit of the reach. The main results presented in this paper are: In spite of the increase of flow during the flood, the reach could be considered as a sink for particles and phosphorus (Table 2) entering at point A, even if the third part of the reach (from C to D) acted as a source (Fig 5). The different shapes of the stream bed are responsible for such an opposing pattern. The hydrochemical measurements at the outlet (point D) show that during the first 120 min following the artificial injection, the water quality has not changed although the flow has increased. Only after that delay, the increase in SO4 concentration indicates the arrival of the injected water. The injected water left the reach 300 min after the artificial injection was stopped. According to Verhoff(1979), this way of water renewal is due to the kinematic wave induced by the increase of discharge. This succession of water led to the existence of two peaks of suspended matter (Fig. 6). The first was due to the increase of flow resulting in resuspension in the third part of the reach. The second, smaller, is associated with the injected water. Phosphorus emission follows the same pattern (Fig. 6). An early and short peak of phosphorus (mainly particulate) is followed, an hour later, by a second increase, of mostly soluble phosphorus. A detailed mass balance of phosphorus, comprising settlement, resuspension and direct transfer is summarized in Table 3. It shows that most of the phosphorus exiting the experimental reach (70% for particulate phosphorus) comes from resuspension. However, the levels of phosphorus released during the experimental flood were low compared to what could be expected in polluted streams, or streams containing an important biological component. A mass balance of soluble phosphorus between A and D revealed that half of its mass was retained in the stream. During low flow periods, such a retention is not very significant. This retention during a small flood may be explained by a sorption reaction on particles. The same patterns described during the artificial Rood occurred during a real summer high Row. Two peaks of suspended matter and phosphorus (Fig. 7) were induced by (1) the increase of flow and (2) the arrival of runoff water (Fig. 8). The proportion of resuspended matter could be estimated (Table 4). This study shows that the establishment of a detailed phosphorus mass balance in streams requires frequent sampling at the beginning of storm Row events. It also shows that the most bioavailable phosphorus form (soluble phosphorus) can be stored even during a small storm flow. This leads to a net gain towards the surface waterbodies, since P quality is modified as long as the storage goes on, and the bioavailability decreased. Finally, we show that within-stream disturbance is an important contribution of the total phosphorus emitted during small floods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Grasman, KA; Whitacre, LL				Grasman, KA; Whitacre, LL			Effects of PCB 126 on thymocyte surface marker expression and immune organ development in chicken embryos	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES												Previous studies have shown that chicken (Gallus domesticus) embryos are sensitive to the immunotoxic effects of Ah receptor agonists. These chemicals cause atrophy of the thymus gland and bursa of Fabricius, the sites of T- and B-lymphocyte maturation, respectively. The object ives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effects of 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126) on thymocyte phenotypes (CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)CD8(-), CD4(-)CD8(+), TCR alpha beta (+), and TCR gamma delta (+)) in chicken embryos, and (2) to compare phenotype alterations with masses and cellularity of lymphoid organs. To simulate exposure in wild avian embryos, chicken eggs were injected with PCB 126 (sunflower oil carrier) into the air cell before incubation. Doses ranged from 0.051 to 0.8 ng/g egg with carrier-injected and noninjected control groups. The thymus and bursa were removed, weighed, and homogenized on d 20 of egg incubation (1 d before hatch). Thymocyte phenotypes were quantified by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies for CD4, CD8, TCR alpha beta (V(beta)1), and TCR gamma delta. Right thymus mass declined with dose, decreasing significantly between 0.32 and 0.8 ng/g to a size 28% lower than controls. Live lymphoid cell numbers in the right thymus dropped markedly (21% lower than controls) between 0.051 and 0.13 ng/g, with a further decrease (35% lower than controls) at higher doses. There was no significant change in the percentage of thymocytes expressing TCR alpha beta. The total number of TCR alpha beta (+) thymocytes decreased with dose as a function of the declines in TCR alpha beta (+) percentages and total thymocyte numbers. The percentages of all other measured phenotypes were unaltered by PCB 126. The total number of CD4(+)CD8(+) cells, and to a lesser degree CD4(-)CD8(+) cells, decreased in a dose-dependent manner following the pattern of total live thymocytes. The number of viable lymphoid cells in the bursa decreased to 45% lower than controls at 0.13 ng/g and fell to 76% lower than controls at 0.8 ng/g. Lymphoid atrophy occurred at doses that were 8- to 12-fold lower with full-term incubation as compared to exposure only during later stages of incubation, and the lymphoid atrophy was associated with decreased TCR alpha beta (+) thymocytes at higher doses. These immunological effects were observed at concentrations of PCB 126 comparable to those found in Great Lakes herring gull eggs, after correcting for interspecies differences in sensitivity to PCB 126.																			1528-7394	1087-2620				FEB	2001	62	3					191	206		10.1080/009841001458307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/009841001458307								11212945					WOS:000166734500004

Mark			The Pliocene Lost River found to west: Detrital zircon evidence of drainage disruption along a subsiding hotspot track	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Symposium on the Track of the Yellowstone Hotspot held at the Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	OCT, 2007	Denver, CO	Geol Soc Amer				SHRIMP analysis of U/Pb ages of detrital zircons in twelve late Miocene to Pleistocene sand samples from six drill cores on the Snake River Plain (SRP), Idaho, suggests that an ancestral Lost River system was drained westward along the northern side of the SRP. Neoproterozoic (650 to 740 Ma, Cryogenian) detrital zircon grains from the Wildhorse Creek drainage of the Pioneer Mountains core complex, with a source in 695 Ma orthogneiss, and which are characteristic of the Big Lost River system, are found in Pliocene sand from cores drilled in the central SRP (near Wendell) and western SRP (at Mountain Home). In addition to these Neoproterozoic grains, fluvial sands sourced from the northern margin of the SRP contain detrital zircons with the following ages: 42 to 52 Ma from the Challis magmatic belt, 80 to 100 Ma from the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith, and mixed Paleozoic and Proterozoic ages (1400 to 2000 Ma). In contrast, sands in the Mountain Home Air Base well (MHAB) that contain 155-Ma Jurassic detrital grains with a source in northern Nevada are interpreted to represent an integrated Snake River, with provenance on the southern, eastern and northern sides of the SRP. We propose that late Pliocene and early Pleistocene construction of basaltic volcanoes and rhyolitic domes of the Axial Volcanic Zone of the eastern SRP and the northwest-trending Arco Volcanic Rift Zone (including the Craters of the Moon volcanic center), disrupted the paleo-Lost River drainage, confining it to the Big Lost Trough, a volcanically dammed basin of internal drainage on the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). After the Axial Volcanic Zone and Arco Volcanic Rift Zone were constructed to form a volcanic eruptive and intrusive highland to the southwest, sediment from the Big Lost River was trapped in the Big Lost Trough instead of being delivered by surface streams to the western SRP. Today, water from drainages north of the SRP enters the Snake River Plain regional aquifer through sinks in the Big Lost Trough, and the water resurfaces at Thousand Springs, Idaho, about 195 km to the southwest. Holocene to latest Pliocene samples from drill core in the Big Lost Trough reveal interplay between the glacio-fluvial outwash of the voluminous Big Lost River system and the relatively minor Little Lost River system. A mixed provenance signature is recognized in fine-grained sands deposited in a highstand of a Pleistocene pluvial-lake system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Maejima, W; Das, R; Pandya, KL; Hayashi, M				Maejima, W; Das, R; Pandya, KL; Hayashi, M			Deglacial control on sedimentation and basin evolution of Permo-Carboniferous Talchir Formation, Talchir Gondwana basin, Orissa, India	GONDWANA RESEARCH					Conference on Basin Development and Evolution in Relation to Rodinia, Gondwana and Asia Tectonics	OCT 26-30, 2001	Okaka, JAPAN					The Permo-Carboniferous Talchir Formation in the southeastern part of the Talchir basin is represented by about 260 in thick elastic succession testing on the Precambrian basement rocks of the Eastern Ghats Group. The succession is tentatively subdivided into four lithostratigraphic units, namely A-1, A-II, B and C from base to top. Un mud-matrixed, very poorly sorted diamictites and interbedded thin sandstone and mudstone yielding dropstones. They reveal deposition in a proglacial lake environment in which ice rafting and suspension sedimentation, as well as meltwater-underflow processes, produced variety of facies. The succession of unit A-II is dominated by pebble to boulder conglomerates and sandstones. They were deposited mostly from various kinds of high-energy sediment gravity flows, both subaerial and subaqueous, and formed steep-faced fan-delta on the margin of the basin. Unit B demonstrates turbidite sedimentation in lake-margin slope and base-of-slope environments, in which a sublacustrine channel-fan system developed. The lake-margin slope was dissected by channels which were accompanied by overbank and levee deposits. Sediments delivered from the mouth of a channel were deposited at the base-of-slope, forming a fan lobe which prograded onto the lake basin floor. Unit C dominantly consists of mudstone with intercalations of siltstone and sandstone and forms a large-scale coarsening-upward deltaic sequence eventually covered by the fluvial deposits of the Karharbari Formation. Following the glacially influenced sedimentation, the Talchir succession shows a vertical facies progression suggesting gradual deepening of the lake basin and eventual filling up of it due to rapid delta progradation. Such a succession represents deglacial control on basin evolution during the Talchir time. In the initial stage of glacial recession, collapse of a glacier and failure of montane glacial lakes frequently occurred and gave rise to generation of a highly sediment-laden debris flow and a catastrophic flood, which brought abundant coarse clastics into the lake and built a fan-delta on the basin margin. The continued recession and disappearance of glacier resulted in abundant supply of ice-melt water into the graben as well as eustatic sea-level rise, being the cause of the rise in lake-level. Subsequent rapid delta progradation and eventual filling-up of the lake basin suggest rapid lake-level fall after deepening of lake basin. It was possibly caused by the regional uplift due to post-glacial isostatic rebound. Rapid draining of lake water through the graben gave rise to the establishment of an axial drainage system which rapidly filled the lake basin in form of an axially fed delta.																			1342-937X					APR	2004	7	2					339	352		10.1016/S1342-937X(05)70788-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1342-937X(05)70788-7													WOS:000220792800005
J	Wilson, CL; Hinman, NW; Sheridan, RP				Wilson, CL; Hinman, NW; Sheridan, RP			Hydrogen peroxide formation and decay in iron-rich geothermal waters: The relative roles of abiotic and biotic mechanisms	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is widely distributed in surface waters where the primary photochemical formation pathway involves the interaction between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR). In laboratory studies using iron-rich water from Yellowstone's Chocolate Pots spring, H2O2 formation depended on sample treatment (unfiltered, <0.2 pm filtered, autoclaved) prior to irradiation, suggesting several formation pathways. Similar H2O2 formation in filtered and unfiltered water indicates that it is primarily soluble material that is responsible for H2O2 formation. H2O2 formation with soluble material probably includes only photochemical reactions with DOC and/or metals. Greater H2O2 formation in unfiltered and filtered water than in autoclaved water suggests that the agent(s) involved in H2O2 formation is (are) not stable at high temperatures and pressures and degrade to nonphotoreactive species. Such unstable agents may include DOC and/or dissolved complexes of iron or other metals. UVR absorbance occurs across the UV spectrum and, though slightly greater in the UVA range (320-400 nm), is similar to that of other surface waters. Increased UVR absorbance after autoclaving suggested degradation or alteration of some components, which in turn affected H2O2 formation. The spectral region used for irradiation affected net formation and yield. H2O2 formation in water irradiated with UVA radiation was 2.5-3 times that formed in water irradiated with UVB radiation (280-320 nm) in experiments using artificial light sources. Apparent quantum yields comparable to those reported by others could not be calculated because the instrumental designs are not the same. However, approximate quantum yields were calculated for these experiments but should be viewed with caution. Quantum yields were higher in these experiments (0.0040 mol H2O2 per mol photon at 310 nm and 0.0012 mol H2O2 per mol photon at 350 mm) than values reported by other researchers (<0.0007 mol H2O2 per mol photon at 300 nm and <0.0005 H2O2 per mol photon at 340 nm; [Scully, N. M., D. R. S. Lean, D. J. McQueen and W. J. Cooper (1996) Limnol. Oceanogr. 41, 540-548]). In natural solar source experiments, N2O2 formation was greater in experiments with UVA and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm) than with PAR alone or with UVB, UVA and PAR. However, H2O2 capacity (nM H2O2 W-1 h(-1) m(2)) was greatest with UVB radiation and lowest with PAR radiation, Source regions could not be studied separately. Dark decay of H2O2 occurred via two mechanisms. The main mechanism responsible for H2O2 decay involved particulate matter (probably microorganisms), whereas a secondary mechanism involved soluble matter (ie. DOG, metal ions and other dissolved species involved in Fenton reactions).																			0031-8655	1751-1097				JUN	2000	71	6					691	699		10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0691:HPFADI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0691:HPFADI>2.0.CO;2								10857364					WOS:000087449400004
J	Wang, RL; Brassell, SC; Fu, JM; Sheng, GY				Wang, RL; Brassell, SC; Fu, JM; Sheng, GY			Molecular indicators of microbial contributions to recent and Tertiary hypersaline lacustrine sediments in China	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In this paper, we investigate the molecular characteristics of recent sediment from the Ejinur salt lake (northern China) and eight Tertiary (Eocene) core samples from Qianjiang Formation (Eq(1-4)) of Jianghan basin, central eastern China, focussing on the distributions and abundances of carboxylic acid isolated from extractable organic matter. n-Alkanoic acids in sediments from both study areas (Ejinur and Jianghan) show a pronounced even over odd predominance (EOP) and a bimodel distribution, In the lower molecular weight range C-16 and C-18 components are prominent with the former dominant. For higher homologues (greater than or equal to C-20), docosanoic (C-22) and tetracosanoic (C-24) acids dominant the n-alkanoic acid homologues for the Jianghan and Ejinur samples, respectively. Alkanoic acids with an isoprenoid skeleton are more abundant in Jianghan, including C-20, C-21, C21, C-24 and C-30 homologues, with a C-25 component (3, 7, 11, 15, 19-pentamethyleicosanoic acid) most pronounced in the lower part of the Qianjiang Fm. The carbon skeletons of these isoprenoid acids are identical to those of isoprenoid hydrocarbons previously recognized in source rocks and petroleums from Jianghan, and attributed to Archaea (formally called archaebacteria; e.g. halophiles, methanogens). The similarity in the distributions of isoprenoid alkanoic acids and alkanes suggests that these isoprenoid acids must derive from comparable biological sources, although they appear to be formed geochemically from biosynthetic precursors (e.g. alkanes, alkenes, alkanols or alkenols). The possibility that these acids are formed as oxidation artifacts from alkanes can be discounted because of the dissimilarity between the distributions of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanes. Iso and anteiso branched carboxylic acids are prevalent in both the Ejinur sample and the upper portion of the Qiangiang Fm (Eq(1-3)) They derive from bacteria, perhaps sulfate reducing bacteria, and their abundances may aid assessment of the importance of bacterial contributions of organic matter in different sedimentary environments. The presence of hopanoid acids and a 3-carboxy steroidal acid further attest to contributions from bacterial and eukaryotic sources, respectively. The occurrence of carboxylic acids in the Jianghan samples confirms the potential for these compounds to survive in ancient sediments and source rocks, notably in hypersaline settings.

Purple nonsulfur bacteria in weakly and moderately mineralized soda lakes of the southern Transbaikal Region and northeastern Mongolia	MICROBIOLOGY												Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNB) are shown to be widespread in weakly and moderately mineralized soda lakes of the southern Transbaikal Region and northeastern Mongolia. PNB occurred in most samples and enrichments at all pH and salinity values recorded or tested. Of the 24 investigated lakes of the southern Transbaikal Region, they were found in 22. In addition, the presence of PNB was noted in most soda lakes of northeastern Mongolia with water mineralization from 3 to 60 g/l. In all of the lakes, PNB were represented by morphologically similar forms. These were motile rods measuring 0.3-0.5 x 1.2-2.5 mu m, multiplying by binary fission and containing bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spheroidene series. 17 pure cultures of PNB were isolated from soda lakes of Chita Oblast, Buryat Republic, Agin Buryat Autonomous District, and northeastern Mongolia. All isolates were weakly halophilic and alkaliphilic and grew in wide ranges of salinity (0.3-15%) and pH (7.5-9.5). The highest growth rate was recorded at a 1-3% salinity and a pH value of about 8.5. The bacteria failed to grow in freshwater medium or at pH 7. All of the isolates were assigned to the genus Rhodovulum according to their morphological and physiological properties. For more precise identification of the new isolates, their phylogenetic analysis was performed. According to the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, the isolates were most close to the species Rhodovulum strictum, from which they however differed at the species level (98.5-99.5% 16S rRNA gene identity and 42-44% DNA-DNA hybridization level). Moreover, the isolates fell into two groups, one of which was comprised by strain A-20s and its close relatives (100% 16S rRNA identity and 93-98% DNA-DNA hybridization level), and the other was represented by the phylogenetically distinct strain A-36s (98.7% 16S rRNA identity and 50-55% DNA-DNA hybridization level). In the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes, sequence signatures were revealed that were specific to the isolates and the two closest species and distinguished them from other Rhodovulum representatives. Thus, the new PNB isolates represent two new species. Currently, their morphological and physiological investigation is in progress, aiming at their description as two new species of the genus Rhodovulum. The fact that PNB of weakly and moderately mineralized soda lakes are represented by new species is one more piece of evidence in favor of our earlier conclusion about the specificity of these habitats and of the autochthonous microflora characteristic of them.

Catchments ranged in elevation from 2475 to 3603 m and from 15 to 1908 ha in area. Soil cover varied from 5% to nearly 97% of total catchment area. Runoff from these snow-dominated catchments ranged from 315 to 1265 mm per year. In the Sierra Nevada, annual volume-weighted mean (AVWM) nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 13 muM (overall average 5.4 muM), and peak concentrations measured during snowmelt ranged from 1.0 to 38 muM. Nitrate levels in the Rocky Mountain watersheds were about twice those in the Sierra Nevada; average AVWM NO3- was 9.4 muM and snowmelt peaks ranged from 15 to 50 muM. Mean DIN loading to Rocky Mountain watersheds, 3.6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), was double the average measured for Sierra Nevada watersheds, 1.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). DIN yield in the Sierra Nevada, 0.69 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), was about 60% that measured in the Rocky Mountains, 1.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Net inorganic N retention in Sierra Nevada catchments was 1.2 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and represented about 55% of annual DIN loading. DIN retention in the Rocky Mountain catchments was greater in absolute terms, 2.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), and as a percentage of DIN loading, 72%. A correlation analysis using DIN yield, DIN retention and surface water nitrate concentrations as dependent variables and eight environmental features (catchment elevation, slope, aspect, roughness, area, runoff, soil cover and DIN loading) as independent variables was conducted. For the Sierra Nevada, elevation and soil cover had significant (p < 0.1) Pearson product moment correlations with catchment DIN yield, AVWM and peak snowmelt nitrate concentrations and DIN retention rates. Log-linear regression models using soil cover as the independent variable explained 82% of the variation in catchment DIN retention, 92% of the variability in AVWM nitrate and 85% of snowmelt peak NO3-. In the Rocky Mountains, soil cover was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with DIN yield, AVWM NO3- and DIN retention expressed as a percentage of DIN loading (%DIN retention). Catchment mean slope and terrain roughness were positively correlated with steam nitrate concentrations and negatively related to %DIN retention. About 91% of the variation in DIN yield and 79% of the variability in AVWM NO3- were explained by log-linear models based on soil cover. A log- linear regression based on soil cover explained 90% of the variation of % DIN retention in the Rocky Mountains.

J	VANNI, MJ				VANNI, MJ			EFFECTS OF FOOD AVAILABILITY AND FISH PREDATION ON A ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The effects of fish predation and food availability on populatin densities and demography of zoooplankton were investigated in Dynamite Lake, Illinois, USA, a lake with a high density of size-selective planktivorous fish and low food levels. Fish predators (bluegill sunfish) and food levels (phytoplankton) were manipulated in replicated, factorial-design field experiments during two summers (1980 and 1981). Overall, population densities of zooplankton were affected much more by manipulations of food availability than by manipulations of fish predation. The cladocerans Bosmina longirostris, Ceriodaphnia lacustris, and Diaphanosoma birgei were greatly increased in density by elevated phytoplankton levels in both years, in the presence and absence of fish. Demographic analysis in 1981 revealed that increased densities in response to elevated food levels resulted from both an increase in birth rates (Bosmina Diaphanosoma) and a decrease in mortality rates (Ceriodaphnia, Diaphanosoma). The rotifers Lecane and Monostyla also increased dramatically in response to elevated phytoplankton densities. Copepods were less responsive to manipulations of food levels, but several taxa exhibited increases in density in response to increased phytoplankton abundance. Few species were reduced in density by fish predation. Ceriodaphnia density was reduced by fish more than any other species in the entire community, and the density of even this species was much more affected by food availability. In terms of percent change relative to controls, increased food availability had much more of an effect than fish predation on the density of most zooplankton species and on total zooplankton abundance. Fish predation had several effects on the size structure and life history traits of the cladocerans. All three species attained larger sizes when fish were excluded than when fish were present. Cladoceran individuals also initiated reproduction at a smaller size and produced smaller offspring in the presence of fish. The reductions in mean body size, size at maturity, and offspring size in the presence of fish were most pronounced in Diaphanosoma and Ceriodaphnia, the two largest species. Smaller body size and size at maturity apparently allow the cladocerans to reproduce before reaching a size at which they become vulnerable to size-selective fish predators. Larger size at first reproduction and larger offspring size in the absence of fish may be a response to invertebrate predators, which assume more importance in the absence of fish and prey most heavily on smaller size classes. Flexibility in these life-history traits allows the cladocerans to withstand what appears to be intense size-selective predation by planktivorous fish.																			0012-9615	1557-7015				MAR	1987	57	1					61	88		10.2307/1942639	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942639													WOS:A1987G433600004
J	Surlyk, F; Sorensen, AM				Surlyk, Finn; Sorensen, Anne Mehlin			An early Campanian rocky shore at Ivo Klack, southern Sweden	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												Well-exposed, ancient rocky shores are rare and the associated shelly faunas are normally strongly worn and fragmented due to erosion during both sea-level rise and fall. An early Campanian rocky shore with a rich fauna is preserved at Ivo Klack in the Kristianstad Basin, southern Sweden. Ivo Klack is situated on the small, hilly island of Ivo situated in lake Ivosjon with a lake level about 6 m above present-day sea level. The rocky shore was formed during a major late early Campanian transgression caused by a sea-level rise up to about 100 m above present sea level. An archipelago was formed along the northern basin margin during the transgression with numerous small islands and peninsulas. The steep palaeo-coast at Ivo Klack consists of gneiss overlain in the lower part by more than 30 m of kaolin in places containing large boulders of gneiss with a kaolinized outer crust. The kaolin wedges out upslope and is absent above 30-35 m above lake level. The kaolin is overlain by up to 5 m of muddy quartz sand with highly angular grains, representing a residue of the kaolin formed during transgressive wave and current reworking. The steep gneiss coast was rapidly transgressed by the sea in the latest early Campanian and at least 25 m of onlapping coarse-grained skeletal sand, gravel and whole fossils were deposited on the clean gneiss surface during the Belemnellocamax mammilatus belemnite biozone. Large boulders of gneiss are common in the carbonates and formed distinct boulder beds at some levels but these are now quarried away. The top 6 m of the preserved carbonate succession are free of boulders. The rocky surface is fairly even on a large scale, but highly irregular in detail with numerous metre-sized hummocks and boulders formed during terrestrial weathering and kaolinization. The lowest part of the shore is developed as a bench, topped by a sub-horizontal irregular platform, 20-30 m wide, with large hummocks and rounded boulders. The platform passes upwards into a steep boulder-strewn slope. A well-developed glauconitized hardground with Thalassinoides burrows and several incipient hardgrounds occur in the carbonates draping the bench and lower part of the platform. They dip gently outwards and probably represent a kind of beach rock. A highly diverse benthic fauna with more than 200 shell-bearing species lived between, below and on the hummocks and boulders. It comprises bivalves, brachiopods, polychaetes, gastropods, echinoids, asteroids, bryozoans and is dominated by large oysters and includes the northernmost Late Cretaceous rudists and hermatypic corals. The remaining benthic invertebrate groups are represented by only a few species each. The non-benthic invertebrate fauna comprises four belemnite species and one rare ammonite species. The lower Campanian carbonates of the small basin have yielded an unusually diverse vertebrate fauna totalling more than 60 species, including mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, birds, and as many as 44 species of sharks and rays. Ivo Klack thus provides information on virtually all trophic levels in the rocky shore ecosystem and represents the most diverse rocky shore fauna known from the geological record. This paper aims at providing the framework for a series of papers on the palaeoecology of the main benthic faunal groups. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	TRIAL, AF; SPERA, FJ; GREER, J; YUEN, DA				TRIAL, AF; SPERA, FJ; GREER, J; YUEN, DA			SIMULATIONS OF MAGMA WITHDRAWAL FROM COMPOSITIONALLY ZONED BODIES	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Heterogeneities in the form of continuous (less common) or discontinuous (more common) mineralogical, geochemical and thermal gradients within volcanic deposits are ubiquitous in the geologic record. Examples cover a wide spectrum of eruptive volumes (10(-2) km3 to > 10(3) km3), compositions (felsic to mafic), mass discharges (10(3) to 10(9) kg/s) and eruptive styles (Plinian air falls, pyroclastic flows, lava flows). An understanding of the dynamics of the magma withdrawal process is essential for accurate reconstruction of pre-eruptive chemical and thermal fields within crustal magma bodies. A model based on numerical solution of the governing conservation equations has been devised in order to investigate the dynamics and systematics of central vent and ring fracture eruptions from flat-roofed and sloped-roof magma bodies strongly zoned in density and viscosity. Scale analysis of the conservation equations together with about 150 numerical experiments enables development of quantitative correlations for the mass discharge, M, and the duration of mixed magma eruption, DELTA-t, with the effective driving pressure, sigma. Natural eruptions span the entire range of dynamic regimes from viscous through inertial. For central vent eruptions in the viscous regime, M is proportional to sigma/(d-eta) where d is the conduit length and eta is the viscosity. In the transitional and inertial regimes, the intensity varies as (sigma/rho)3/5 and (sigma/rho)1/2, respectively, where rho is the density. Similarly, DELTA-t depends on (sigma/d)-1, sigma--3/5 and sigma--1/2 in the viscous, transitional, and inertial regimes, respectively. For systems with layered viscosity structure, DELTA-t is nearly independent of the viscosity ratio. Pressures (above hydrostatic) needed to drive eruptions are proportional to M, M5/3, and M2 in the three dynamic regimes. Typical eruptions in the viscous and transitional regimes require pressure anomalies of order 10(2) to 10(3) Pa whereas high intensity (inertial) eruptions demand anomalies of order 10(6) Pa. Because the lower values are less than or equal to maximum tidally induced stresses, Earth tides appear capable of exciting eruptions. Several scenarios for producing variable discharge during a single eruptive phase were also studied. These include arbitrary changes in the basal pressure and eruptions controlled by density and viscosity gradients. It is demonstrated quantitatively that compositional gaps and episodes of mixed-magma eruption can originate due to the withdrawal process itself and are not necessarily related to pre-eruptive gradients within the magma body.

C	Runge, J		Heine, K		Runge, J			Stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analysis of alluvial sediments and Holocene environmental changes in the Mbari valley in the Southeast of the Central African Republic (CAR)	PALAEOECOLOGY OF AFRICA AND THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS, VOL 27	PALAEOECOLOGY OF AFRICA AND THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS				15th International-Quaternary-Association Conference	AUG 03-11, 1999	DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA	Int Quaternary Assoc				Recent trends in African climate have an influence on the complex rainforest savanna vegetation fringes between C4- (savanna) and C3- (mainly forest) dominated groups of plants. Equally, former Pleistocene modifications of climate have also had a strong effect on the extension of these marginal ecosystems. An increase or a decrease of the respective area resulting from a mainly climate-controlled extension or shrinking of savanna or forest biotopes has been observed. The modified vegetation cover does have a direct influence on the run-off processes and on the discharge of the draining river systems. Because the majority of forest-savanna borders in central Africa is situated on geologically old planation surfaces, the main source of palaeoenvironmental information are alluvial sediments of rivers. This paper focuses on the examination of alluvial soils and the determination of stable carbon isotopes (delta(13)C) of organic sediments on the Mbomou plateau and in the Mbari valley in the southeast of the Central African Republic (CAR). It has been shown that there is some evidence for an ongoing and future increase in C3-dominated forest plants reducing the recent extension of savannas in the study area. The most important reasons for this trend are sufficient amount of annual rain fall (> 1500 mm), negative migration processes of the rural population due to the economic crisis in central Africa with an interconnected decrease in bush-fire frequency, as well as the global increase in atmospheric CO2 affecting higher rates of net-photosynthesis in C3 plants. By the analysis of delta(13)C values in fossil soil horizons it has been found that a greater extent of semi-evergreen forest on the Mbomou plateau seem to have occurred around 7-7.5 ka and between 2.5-3 ka. Drier, savanna-dominated vegetation patterns were found for 5 ka and for I ka up to the present time. It is shown that the more humid and and climate periods during the Holocene are partly in correspondence with high and low lake levels of Lake Chad. The findings are well confirmed by other recent studies from neighbouring Central African regions as Cameroon, Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville (Bateke plateau) which indicates a more general validity of the findings from the Mbomou plateau.																			0168-6208		90-5809-350-6				2001	27						135	151																WOS:000173048100011

Fossils of prokaryotic microorganisms in the Orgueil meteorite - art. no. 630902	Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology IX	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)				Conference on Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology IX	AUG 14-15, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The Orgueil CI1 meteorite, which fell in southern France on the evening of May 14, 1864, has been one of the most extensively studied of all known carbonaceous meteorites. Environmental and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM and FESEM) studies of freshly fractured interior surfaces of the Orgueil meteorite have resulted in the detection of the fossilized remains of a large and diverse population of filamentous prokaryotic microorganisms. The taphonomy and the modes of the preservation of these remains are diverse. Some of the remains exhibit carbonization of a hollow sheath and in other cases the remains are permineralized with water-soluble evaporite minerals, such as magnesium sulfate or ammonium salts. Images and EDS spectral data are provided documenting a variety of Orgueil microstructures: abiotic evaporite minerals; pre-solar grains; framboids, ovoids and fluorine-rich filaments of indeterminate biogenicity. These results provide information regarding the size, size range, morphologies and chemical compositions of abiotic microstructures found in native cryptolialite and crystalline and fibrous epsomites from Poison Lake, Washington, USA and Catalayud, Zaragoza, Aragon, Spain. High resolution ESEM and FESEM secondary and backscattered. electron Images and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) data will also be presented of recognizable filamentous cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic microfossils. Many of the microfossils found embedded in the meteorite rock matrix are consistent in size and microstructure with known genera and species of filamentous cyanobacteria. Many of these forms can be recognized as morphotypes of cyanobacteria belonging to the Order Oscillaloriaceae. These large, complex microstructures are clearly distinguishable from the abiotic minerals examined - cryptolialite and fibrous epsomites. Many of the well-preserved filamentous forms in the Orgueil meteorite are embedded in the rock matrix and exhibit identifiable biological characteristics and EDS elemental compositions that clearly differentiate them from abiotic microstructures. They exhibit branched and unbranched filaments; uniseriate and multiseriate ensheathed trichomes with specialized cells and structures for reproduction (e.g. hormogonia and akinetes) and nitrogen fixation (heterocysts). The meteorite forms also show evidence of motility (emergent hormogonia and hollow, coiled empty sheaths) and they are often found in mats, consortia and microbial assemblages that are consistent with the known associations and ecologies of modem genera and species of cyanobacteria. Smaller filaments, consistent with the phototrophic filamentous prokaryotes typically present in anoxic layers associated with modem cyanobacterial mats, have also been found in the Orgueil meteorite.																			0277-786X		0-8194-6388-4				2006	6309						30902	30902	630902	10.1117/12.690441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.690441													WOS:000241767700002

Here, we estimated the contribution from a very local source, that of human urine, related to intensive use by visitors in Loch Vale Watershed (LVWS). Not only does urine convey hormones, pharmaceuticals, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic-resistant genes to the environment, but it also contributes Nr, which contributes to loss of biodiversity and eutrophication. Using caffeine as a specific marker for human urine, we compared the calculated maximum potential input of urine with that from wet atmospheric Nr deposition. The maximum potential input is a worst-case scenario. Nearly 30,000 and 45,000 people hiked the 4.0 km to the Loch, the lowest lake in LVWS, in June-September 2019 and 2020, respectively. Informal trails and informal latrine sites were mapped, and the contribution of human urine was calculated based on several assumptions, including that each visitor voided their bladder on the ground once per visit somewhere in Loch Vale. The resulting Nr input from urine in Loch Vale for the summer months of June through September was 0.02 kg Nr ha(-1), and prorated to a full year, the 2019 potential contribution of human waste was 0.06 kg ha(-1) year(-1). These values are compared with June-September 1.2 kg Nr ha(-1) from wet atmospheric deposition or annual measured 2019 deposition of 2.5 kg Nr ha(-1) year(-1), to indicate a contribution of 2% Nr to the waters of Loch Vale from local human urine. Most Nr in this alpine and subalpine watershed is still attributable to emissions and subsequent wet atmospheric deposition, but a 2% contribution from human waste is not insignificant. In the very broadest sense, our results document an ecological disturbance from an unprecedented level of human activity in a protected and designated wilderness area. Local solutions to this local problem could include greater outreach to visitors of public lands about the consequences of their activities and installation of latrines.

J	Wang, N; Liu, Z; Sun, YY; Lu, N; Luo, YH				Wang, Na; Liu, Zhe; Sun, Yingying; Lu, Nan; Luo, Yuhu			Analysis of soil fertility and toxic metal characteristics in open-pit mining areas in northern Shaanxi	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The study specifically focused on the Hongliulin mining area, where a total of 40 soil samples were meticulously collected and analyzed from within a 1000 m radius extending from the tailings dam. The findings revealed that soil pH within the 0-1000 m range generally leaned towards the alkaline side. In terms of soil nutrient content, encompassing factors such as soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), alkali nitrogen (AK), available phosphorus (AP), and quick-acting potassium (AK), the variations fell within the following ranges: 2.23-13.58 g/kg, 0.12-0.73 g/kg, 0.18-1.15 g/kg, 9.54-35.82 g/kg, 2.89-6.76 mg/kg, 3.45-11.25 mg/kg, and 5.86-130.9 mg/kg. Collectively, these values indicate relatively low levels of soil nutrients. Within the 0-500 m range of soil samples, the average concentrations of Cd, Hg, Pb, and As were 0.778, 0.198, 24.87, and 17.92 mg/kg, respectively. These concentrations exceeded the established soil background values of Shaanxi Province and emerged as the primary pollutants in the study area. Within this same range, the mean values of eight toxic metals (Pi) were ranked in the following descending order: 1.726 (Hg), 1.400 (As), 1.129 (Cr), 1.109 (Pb), 0.623 (Zn), 0.536 (Cd), 0.309 (Cu), and 0.289 (Ni). With the exception of Hg, As, Cr, and Pb, which exhibited slight pollution, the other toxic metals were found to be within acceptable pollution limits for this sampling range, in line with the results obtained using the geo-accumulation index method. The average potential ecological risk index for the eight toxic metals in the study area stood at 185.0, indicating a moderate overall pollution level. When assessing individual elements, the proportions of ecological risk attributed to Hg, As, Pb, and Cd were 34.57%, 27.44%, 25.11%, and 23.11%, respectively. This suggests that the primary potential ecological risk elements in the study area are Hg and As, followed by Cd and Pb. Notably, toxic metals Hg and Pb, as well as As and Pb, exhibited significant positive correlations within the sampling area, suggesting a common source. An analysis of the relationship between soil physicochemical properties and toxic metals indicated that soil pH, SOM, TN, and TP were closely linked to toxic metal concentrations. The toxic metal elements in the research area's soil exhibit moderate variability (0.16 < CV < 0.36) to high variability (CV > 0.36). Within the range of 0-200 m, the CV values for Cd and Hg exceed 1, indicating a high level of variability. The coefficient of variation for SOM, TP, AP, AK and TK is relatively high with the of 2.93, 2.36, 2.36, 21.01, 7.54. The soil in the sampling area has undergone significant disturbances due to human activities, resulting in toxic metal pollution and nutrient deficiencies.					sun, yingying/KIC-6104-2024														2045-2322					JAN 27	2024	14	1							2273	10.1038/s41598-024-52886-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-52886-8								38280937					WOS:001152431000027

Eruptive history and tectonic setting of Medicine Lake Volcano, a large rear-arc volcano in the southern Cascades	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Medicine Lake Volcano (MLV), located in the southern Cascades similar to 55 km east-northeast of contemporaneous Mount Shasta, has been found by exploratory geothermal drilling to have a surprisingly silicic core mantled by mafic lavas. This unexpected result is very different from the long-held view derived from previous mapping of exposed geology that MLV is a dominantly basaltic shield volcano. Detailed mapping shows that <6% of the similar to 2000 km(2) of mapped MLV lavas on this southern Cascade Range shield-shaped edifice are rhyolitic and dacitic, but drill holes on the edifice penetrated more than 30% silicic lava. Argon dating yields ages in the range similar to 475 to 300 ka for early rhyolites. Dates on the stratigraphically lowest mafic lavas at MLV fall into this time frame as well, indicating that volcanism at MLV began about half a million years ago. Mafic compositions apparently did not dominate until similar to 300 ka. Rhyolite eruptions were scarce post-300 ka until late Holocene time. However, a dacite episode at similar to 200 to similar to 180 ka included the volcano's only ash-flow tuff, which was erupted from within the summit caldera. At similar to 100 ka, compositionally distinctive high-Na andesite and minor dacite built most of the present caldera rim. Eruption of these lavas was followed soon after by several large basalt flows, such that the combined area covered by eruptions between 100 ka and postglacial time amounts to nearly two-thirds of the volcano's area. Postglacial eruptive activity was strongly episodic and also covered a disproportionate amount of area. The volcano has erupted 9 times in the past 5200 years, one of the highest rates of late Holocene eruptive activity in the Cascades. Estimated volume of MLV is similar to 600 km(3), giving an overall effusion rate of similar to 1.2 km(3) per thousand years, although the rate for the past 100 kyr may be only half that. During much of the volcano's history, both dry HAOT (high-alumina olivine tholeiite) and hydrous calcalkaline basalts erupted together in close temporal and spatial proximity. Petrologic studies indicate that the HAOT magmas were derived by dry melting of spinel peridotite mantle near the crust mantle boundary. Subduction-derived H2O-rich fluids played an important role in the generation of calcalkaline magmas. Petrology, geochemistry and proximity indicate that MLV is part of the Cascades magmatic arc and not a Basin and Range volcano, although Basin and Range extension impinges on the volcano and strongly influences its eruptive style. MLV may be analogous to Mount Adams in southern Washington, but not, as sometimes proposed, to the older distributed back-arc Simcoe Mountains volcanic field. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Beddoe-Stephens, B; Millward, D				Beddoe-Stephens, B; Millward, D			Very densely welded, rheomorphic ignimbrites of homogeneous intermediate calc-alkaline composition from the English Lake District	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												Within a largely concealed, caldera-related volcaniclastic succession of the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group in the western Lake District, two thick (100-350 m) ignimbrites within the Fleming Hall Formation exhibit a number of features that in combination make them unusual deposits. They are both homogeneous with comparatively low-SiO2 (63%) bulk composition, contain only a moderate crystal content, are generally poor in lithic clasts, show uniformly very dense welding (yielding parataxitic to massive vitrophyric texture) throughout and lack associated fall-out or surge deposits. Ignimbrites of comparable bulk composition in this geological setting are usually part of zoned sheets and/or frequently very crystal-rich. Large-scale, unzoned densely welded ignimbrites are usually rhyodacitic to rhyolitic. By contrast, ignimbrites of intermediate composition that display dense welding are relatively small deposits that form by agglutination of hot, plastic spatter. It is postulated that the Fleming Hall ignimbrites were derived from low column height, low explosivity eruptions that conserved heat and minimized entrainment of accidental lithic clasts and the formation of fine ash. The very dense welding and lack of bubble-wall shard vitroclastic textures indicate that pyroclasts were hot and relatively dry, probably occurring as mildly vesicular (scoriaceous) fragments which welded or fused together during aggradational deposition rather than by post-depositional compactional loading. There is little variation in the degree of matrix or melt crystallization throughout the two ignimbrites, despite the fact that high temperatures must have been maintained for many years following deposition. Both display Virtually ubiquitous development of micropoikilitic glass devitrification texture, which suggests that the viscosity of the supercooled dacitic melt was sufficiently high, probably due to initial degassing, to inhibit significant melt crystallization after deposition. The eruption of the Fleming Hall magmas was probably initiated by the rise or injection of hotter, more basic, magma, and not by overpressurization due to volatile exsolution resulting from cooling and crystallization. Foundering of the chamber roof caused forcible and rapid eruption of the magma, probably along a series of volcanotectonic faults rather than a central vent, and probably flooded the resultant caldera depression. It is predicted that this type of eruption will not have produced a widely dispersed deposit, the bulk of which may have been largely contained within its own caldera.																			0016-7568	1469-5081				MAR	2000	137	2					155	173		10.1017/S0016756800003952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756800003952													WOS:000087547100004

Few of these studies, however, have contributed to the prediction of ecologically significant effects (i.e., at the population or community levels). The present field study was designed to evaluate the potential of metallothionein (MT) and sub-cellular metal partitioning measurements for predicting toxic effects at higher levels of the biological organization in freshwater bivalves (Pyganodon grandis) chronically exposed to Cd. For that purpose, we quantitatively sampled P. grandis populations in the littoral zone of nine lakes on the Precambrian Canadian Shield during two consecutive summers (1998 and 1999); lakes were characterized by contrasting Cd levels but similar trophic status. We tested relationships between the population status of P. grandis (i.e., growth parameters, density, biomass, secondary production, turnover ratio and cumulative fecundity) and (i) ambient Cd concentrations, (ii) sub-organismal responses (NIT concentrations in the gill cytosol of individuals and Cd concentrations in three metal-ligand pools identified as M-HMW, the high molecular weight pool, M-MT, the metallothionein-like pool and M-LMW, the low molecular weight pool) and (iii) ecological confounding factors (food resources, presence of host fishes for the obligatory parasitic larval stage of P. grandis). Our results show that littoral density, live weight, dry viscera biomass, production and cumulative fecundity decreased with increasing concentrations of the free-cadmium ion in the environment (Pearson's r ranging from -0.63 to -0.78). On the other hand, theoretical maximum shell lengths (L-infinity) in our populations were related to both the dissolved Ca concentration and food quality (sestonic C and N concentrations). Overall, Cd concentrations in the gill cytosolic HMW pool of the individual molluscs were the biomarker response that was most frequently and most strongly correlated with the population variables (Pearson's r ranging from -0.58 to -0.80). Our findings demonstrate, however, the difficulty of currently assigning to sub-cellular metal partitioning measurements (mainly Cd bound to the HMW fraction) any predictive role for population health, notably because of the influence of ecological confounding variables (e.g., the cumulative number of degree-days in the littoral zone, as is the case here). Metal contamination of our lakes has decreased markedly in the past 10 years and consequently we believe that the toxic effects of metals may have been replaced by some natural factors as the main agent for structuring the clam populations in these lakes.

The geology of the study area is very important for the geodynamic evolution of the Eastern Taurus. Geological formations in the study area are Paleozoic Keban metamorphics, Upper Cretaceous Harami Formation, Middle-Upper Eocene Kirkgecit Formation, Upper Miocene Karabakir Formation, and Quaternary alluvium, from the oldest to the youngest, respectively. Hydrogeological units were divided into three units in accordance with lithological, structural and hydrogeological properties. The basement of the study area of sandstone, marbles and dolomitic marbles in the Keban metamorphic rocks are highly fractured and karstified and act as the main reservoir in particular for thermal waters in the study area. Kirkgecit and Karabakir Formations occur as barrier rocks in the geothermal area due to impermeable properties. Some levels of limestone units within the Keban metamorphics are aquifers for freshwater. Alluvium is the most important and suitable unit for cold groundwater production. In the study area, streams and rivers flow from southwest to northeast towards Keban Dam Lake. The lake is very important in the region from the point of view of hydroelectric power production, flood control, and irrigation. The thermal and mineral waters generally have high mineral contents. When they are discharged onto the surface, they can cause contamination in surface water, ground water, and of soil. Because of the fact that the water resources in the region are used for drinking and irrigation purposes, the quality of the water is evaluated within the scope of this study. For this reason, water and sediment samples were analyzed for boron, arsenic and other contaminant (Pb, Fe, Sb, Sn and Hg) substances to measure the contamination. The results acquired from the analysis of water samples suggest that concentrations of B, As and Pb in some of the samples exceed the limits of the TSE drinking-water standards(>100 ppb). Fe concentration is 2.16 ppm, Hg and Sb concentrations are also 0.05 ppm. Moreover, some of the sediment samples collected from thermal springs in Singec Creek are contaminated with B, As, Sb, Hg and Pb and other elements sourced from geothermal fluids. In this study, the geochemical evaluation of the presence of B, As, and other contaminants (Pb, Fe, Sb, Sn) derived from geothermal activities within sediment and water in the Pertek Geothermal Field and surrounding area were discussed.

Simple is better when it comes to sequence stratigraphy: The Clearwater Formation of the Mannville Group reinterpreted using a genetic body approach	AAPG BULLETIN												Analysis of high-resolution three-dimensional seismic data from the Cold Lake Production Project (CLPP) of central Alberta, Canada, has resulted in a new sequence stratigraphic interpretation and depositional model for the upper Albian Clearwater Formation of the Mannville Group. Specifically, we document the presence of one sequence boundary within the Clearwater Formation that (1) separates older, deltaic deposits from a younger fluvial-dominated, terraced incised valley fill succession and (2) ties to a lowstand shoreline approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the north of the CLPP. Although this interpretation is far simpler than previous stratigraphic interpretations of this area, the sedimentologic record within the Clearwater Formation remains very complex because of the vertical stacking of high-energy fluvial to fluvial-estuarine deposits that are scour based. The composite sequence boundary identified here is associated with an extended period of landscape degradation and the formation of a moderately large valley that is complexly defined by a series of terraced fluvial deposits. Because individual channels eroded vertically and migrated laterally during both the fall and ensuing rise of sea level, the resulting valley-shaped stratigraphic sand body is (1) substantially wider than the true topographic valley (i.e., landform that is constrained by subvertical to near-vertical walls, open to the air, and typically resulting from degradation of the landscape via vertical and lateral erosion by a fluvial channel or channels) within which the lowstand channels flowed, (2) formed by both fluvial and marine processes that can be allogenic and/or autogenic in nature, and (3) defined by a composite surface that formed during the descending limb of a base level cycle and was partially modified during the subsequent base level rise and is thus of minor chronologic significance. We attempt to define the time of maximum topographic valley development, but younger erosion has removed much of the record of this valley. However, we estimate that the Clearwater Formation topographic valley had a maximum incision depth of greater than 60 m (> 197 ft) and a width of approximately 20 km (12 mi). These dimensions correlate very well to incised valleys observed in the Quaternary. Analysis of core and log results within our seismic stratigraphic framework indicates that a fluviodeltaic model best explains the lithofacies distributions and geometries within the CLPP. Furthermore, finer-scale seismic mapping was used to encapsulate packages of sedimentwhich we refer to as genetic sedimentary bodies-whose reservoir properties could then be defined using core results. A genetic body approach to defining stratal architectures has resulted in (1) a predictive model for reservoir types and distributions across the CLPP; (2) accurate paleoenvironmental interpretations; and (3) a simple, yet robust sequence stratigraphic model of this area that is aligned with recent results reported from the study of similar systems in the Quaternary, recent morphologic observations from small-scale, physical sand box experiments, and themost up-to-date models of coastal fluvial erosion, deposition, and stratigraphic surface formation.

Natural and Constructed Wetlands: Nutrients, Metals and Management					5th Workshop on Nutrient Cycling and Retention in Natural and Constructed Wetland	SEP 24-27, 2003	Borova Lada, CZECH REPUBLIC					Fingerponds are small elongate pools excavated by hand in the flood zones of Lake Victoria and the Rufiji River. Within EC Fingerpond project INCO-DEV (ICA4-CT-2001-10037) 24 fingerponds were dug in three participating countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) during 2002. In each country two village communities each excavated 4 experimental fingerponds of c. 8 x 24 in. individual size and with raised beds between them of c.8 in in width. The project aims to test the possibilities for fish production based on self-stocking and limnological research, and to develop methods for the use of fingerponds on a larger scale. Times of pond digging, flooding, disconnection and isolation for fish production are given for all sites. Methods for field monitoring, measurements and sampling, including primary production, zooplankton and fish censuses, and for the application of organic fertilizers are described. Fish migrants in the Lake Victoria basin which become self-stocked with flood recession are mostly Oreochromis species (tilapias) together with haplochromines, clariids, Protopterus aethiopicus, (lungfish) and one or two smaller species. The roles of fish predators, tadpoles, and adult frogs are considered. Natural primary production (as chlorophyll) and diurnal shifts in oxygen concentrations were indicative of relatively low nutrient availability for long term fish production. Water conductivities ranged from 100 mu S/cm to > 10 000 mu S/cm and chlorophyll concentrations were maximally 40 mu g/L and generally about 10 mu g/L. Quantities and sizes of zooplankton were relatively small. Management measures to increase fish production and natural fish food supply, notably zooplankton, are discussed.. Additions of organic fertilizers resulted in raised primary and fish production without substantial falls in oxygen concentrations, but in dry periods fertilizers should be applied carefully to avoid oxygen deficiency in shallow water. Other measures such as fish harvesting, stock equalisations, single sex selections, water level variations (uncontrolled) and fish predator stocking, are discussed in terms of their potential effects on fish yields. Principles of food chain functioning in tropical fingerponds are compared with temperate aquaculture where three basic situations may be distinguished relating water quality and biological status to fish stock levels namely: low fish density with large sized zooplankton; medium fish density with high biodiversity and turnover of zooplankton; and high fish stock density with low biomas and tiny zooplankton. The roles of zooplankton and phytoplankton in tilapia production are discussed and indicators for fish pond management in the tropical zone suggested.

J	Faustini, JM; Kaufmann, PR; Herlihy, AT				Faustini, John M.; Kaufmann, Philip R.; Herlihy, Alan T.			Downstream variation in bankfull width of wadeable streams across the conterminous United States	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Bankfull channel width is a fundamental measure of stream size and a key parameter of interest for many applications in hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and stream ecology. We developed downstream hydraulic geometry relationships for bankfull channel width w as a function of drainage area A, w = alpha A(beta), (DHG(wA)) for nine aggregate ecoregions comprising the conterminous United States using 1588 sites from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA), including 1152 sites from a randomized probability survey sample. Sampled stream reaches ranged from 1 to 75 m in bankfull width and 1 to 10,000 km(2) in drainage area. The DHG(wA) exponent beta, which expresses the rate at which bankfull stream width scales with drainage area, fell into three distinct clusters ranging from 0.22 to 0.38. Width increases more rapidly with basin area in the humid Eastern Highlands (encompassing the Northern and Southern Appalachians and the Ozark Mountains) and the Upper Midwest (Great Lakes region) than for the West (both mountainous and xeric areas), the southeastern Coastal Plain, and the Northern Plains (the Dakotas and Montana). Stream width increases least rapidly with basin area in the Temperate Plains (combelt) and Southern Plains (Great Prairies) in the heartland. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) was least in the noncoastal plains (0.36-0.41) and greatest in the Appalachians and Upper Midwest (0.68-0.77). DHG(wA) equations differed between streams with dominantly fine bed material (silt/sand) and those with dominantly coarse bed material (gravel/cobble/boulder) in six of the nine analysis regions. Where DHG(wA) equations varied by sediment size, fine-bedded streams were consistently narrower than coarse-bedded streams. Within the Western Mountains ecoregion, where there were sufficient sites to develop DHG(wA) relationships at a finer spatial scale, alpha and beta ranged from 1.23 to 3.79 and 0.23 to 0.40, respectively, with r(2)>0.50 for 10 of 13 subregions (range: 0.36 to 0.92). Enhanced DHG equations incorporating additional data for three landscape variables that can be derived from GIS-mean annual precipitation, elevation, and mean reach slope-significantly improved equation fit and predictive value in several regions, most notably the Western Mountains and the Temperate Plains. Channel width was also related to human disturbance. We examined the influence of human disturbance on channel width using several indices of local and basinwide disturbance. Contrary to our expectations, the data suggest that the dominant response of channel width to human disturbance in the United States is a reduction in bankfull width in streams with greater disturbance, particularly in the Western Mountains (where population density, road density, agricultural land use, and local riparian disturbance were all negatively related to channel width) and in the Appalachians and New England (where urban and agricultural land cover and riparian disturbance were all negatively associated with channel width).

C	Bachhuber, FW; Catto, NR		McLaren, SJ; Kniveton, DR		Bachhuber, FW; Catto, NR			Geologic evidence of rapid, multiple, and high-magnitude climate change during the last glacial (Wisconsinan) of North America	LINKING CLIMATE CHANGE TO LAND SURFACE CHANGE	ADVANCES IN GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH				Annual Conference on Linking Climate Change to Land Surface Change	JAN   05, 1999	ROYAL GEOGRAPH SOC, LEICESTER, ENGLAND	Assoc British Climatol, British Geomorphol Res Grp, Royal Geograph Soc, Inst British Geographers	ROYAL GEOGRAPH SOC			Over the last few decades data derived from ice cores and dendrochronologic sequences indicate that former climate change during the Quaternary has been rapid and of high magnitude. The Estancia Valley, central New Mexico, U.S.A. contains a high-resolution sedimentologic and palaeontologic pluvial-lake record that supports these data. The known Estancia Valley record, in outcrop and subcrop, spans the Wisconsinan (last glacial episode of North America) and represents relatively continuous deposition through that time. The period from early to middle Wisconsinan (ca. 60,000 BP to 30,000 BP) is marked by a relatively stable climate, represented by dry playa and saline lake sediment and fossils. At the beginning of the late Wisconsinan, however, climatic instability becomes the norm. The first fresh-water pluvial lake, as evidenced by fossils, appears at ca. 24,000 BP, followed by additional discrete fresh-water lakes at ca. 21,000 BP, ca. 20,500, ca. 20,000 BP, ca. 17,000 BP, and ca. 14,000 BP. Each of these seemingly deeper-water stands was separated by desiccation events (the last dating after ca. 12,400 BP) indicating that each lake phase resulted from high magnitude climate change (full pluvial to full inter-pluvial climate). It also appears that each lake phase developed rapidly, stabilized for only a short period, and desiccated rapidly. Late Lake Estancia, the highest lake stand of about 52 m deep and dated at ca. 20,000 BP (coinciding with the late Wisconsinan glacial maximum) offers the most conclusive evidence of rapid lake development from dry-playa climatic conditions. The Late Lake Estancia sedimentary sequence consists of deposition on an unconformable surface, an interval of saline-lake adapted organisms, brackish-water-adapted organisms, and finally infrahaline-adapted organisms, all within a 10 cm stratigraphic interval. Radiocarbon ages and sedimentation rates suggest that change from dry-playa conditions to full pluvial-lake conditions (maximum lake depth) back to a dry playa occurred within a few decades to a few centuries. It is likely that the other fresh-water stands developed and disappeared in a similar time span. The rise and fall of major pluvial systems in the southwest U.S.A. demonstrate that the geologic response to rapid climate change can also be rapid.																					0-7923-6638-7				2000	6						143	169																WOS:000166737200008

Nonetheless, it underwent no less serious changes after the melting of the glacier, when, under the conditions of climate mitigation, the gradual formation of modern landscapes began in the spaces freed from ice. This study is devoted to the reconstruction of the post-glacial environment in one of the regions of Eastern Europe, in the south-eastern part of the Baltics. The uniquely preserved deposits of one of the post-glacial basins discovered here made it possible to reconstruct in detail the changes in climate, vegetation, and aquatic organisms in the time interval of 14-13.4 thousand years ago. The study revealed that during this period there were short-lasting climate fluctuations (warmings and coolings), which caused repeated changes in all components of the local nature. The results of the study contribute to understanding the complex processes of planetary climate formation, as well as the impact of climate on nature both at local and global levels, which is necessary not only for understanding the past, but also for predicting the future of all living organisms on the planet. This paper presents the results of a study on the Kulikovo section (south-eastern Baltic Sea coast), a sediment sequence exposing deposits of a post-glacial basin that existed along the edge of the glacier in the Late Pleistocene. The research was targeted at the reconstruction of the dynamics of the local environmental systems in response to climatic oscillations of the Lateglacial (the Older Dryas-first half of the Allerod). The evolution of the local biotic components on the territories of the Baltic region after the ice retreat is still poorly understood. Data from geochronological, lithological, diatom, algo-zoological and palynological analyses provide a reconstruction of local aquatic and terrestrial biocenoses and their response to short-term warmings and coolings that took place 14,000-13,400 cal yr BP. This study has demonstrated that, during the Older Dryas and first part of the Allerod (GI-1d and GI-1c), the aquatic and terrestrial environment of the Kulikovo basin underwent several changes, resulting in eight stages of the basin evolution, most probably related to the short-term climatic fluctuations that could have had a duration of several decades. The data obtained in this study have revealed the fairly dynamic and complex evolution of the pioneer landscapes, as indicated by the changes in the hydrological regime of the area and by the traced successions of plant communities from the pioneer swampy vegetation to park and real forests towards the middle of the Allerod.

J	Bradbury, JP; Colman, SM; Dean, WE				Bradbury, JP; Colman, SM; Dean, WE			Limnological and climatic environments at Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon during the past 45,000 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Upper Klamath Lake, in south-central Oregon, contains long sediment records with well-preserved diatoms and lithological variations that reflect climate-induced limnological changes. These sediment archives complement and extend high resolution terrestrial records along a north - south transect that includes areas influenced by the Aleutian Low and Subtropical High, which control both marine and continental climates in the western United States. The longest and oldest core collected in this study came from the southwest margin of the lake at Caledonia Marsh, and was dated by radiocarbon and tephrochronology to an age of about 45 ka. Paleolimnological interpretations of this core, based upon geochemical and diatom analyses, have been augmented by data from a short core collected from open water environments at nearby Howards Bay and from a 9-m core extending to 15 ka raised from the center of the northwestern part of Upper Klamath Lake. Pre- and full-glacial intervals of the Caledonia Marsh core are characterized and dominated by lithic detrital material. Planktic diatom taxa characteristic of cold-water habitats (Aulacoseira subarctica and A. islandica) alternate with warm-water planktic diatoms ( A. ambigua) between 45 and 23 ka, documenting climate changes at millennial scales during oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 3. The full-glacial interval contains mostly cold-water planktic, benthic, and reworked Pliocene lacustrine diatoms ( from the surrounding Yonna Formation) that document shallow water conditions in a cold, windy environment. After 15 ka, diatom productivity increased. Organic carbon and biogenic silica became significant sediment components and diatoms that live in the lake today, indicative of warm, eutrophic water, became prominent. Lake levels fell during the mid-Holocene and marsh environments extended over the core site. This interval is characterized by high levels of organic carbon from emergent aquatic vegetation (Scirpus) and by the Mazama ash (7.55 ka), generated by the eruption that created nearby Crater Lake. For a brief time the ash increased the salinity of Upper Klamath Lake. High concentrations of molybdenum, arsenic, and vanadium indicate that Caledonia Marsh was anoxic from about 7 to 5 ka. After the mid-Holocene, shallow, but open-water environments returned to the core site. The sediments became dominated (> 80%) by biogenic silica. The open-water cores show analogous but less extreme limnological and climatic changes more typical of mid-lake environments. Millennial-scale lake and climate changes during OIS 3 at Upper Klamath Lake contrast with a similar record of variation at Owens Lake, about 750 km south. When Upper Klamath Lake experienced cold-climate episodes during OIS 3, Owens Lake had warm but wet episodes; the reverse occurred during warmer intervals at Upper Klamath Lake. Such climatic alternations apparently reflect the variable position and strength of the Aleutian Low during the mid-Wisconsin.

J	Tedesco, WA; Major, RP; Baria, LR				Tedesco, WA; Major, RP; Baria, LR			An eolian facies within the Upper Jurassic Smackover Formation, Tchula Lake field, Mississippi	AAPG BULLETIN												The Late Jurassic upper Smackover Formation in Mississippi is primarily composed of an overall regressive sequence of marine carbonate ramp deposits. In central Mississippi, however, carbonate deposition was interrupted by a large influx of siliciclastic sediment. Tchula Lake field is unique not only because it produces gas and condensate from dolomitic quartz sandstone deposited in a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate environment but also because it produces from what we interpret to be an eolian dune sand facies. Throughout the Gulf Coast Basin no previous literature has cited an eolian facies within the Smackover Formation. Several characteristics of the producing zone sandstones have led to interpretations of this unit as an eolian coastal dune facies deposited on and around a Jurassic paleohigh. Facies and paleoenvironmental interpretations are based on compositions and textures described in cores and thin sections. The eolian facies consists of fine-grained, dolomitic quartz sandstone with a mean porosity of 10-20% and permeability of 0-800 md. The sand grains are rounded to subrounded and well sorted. The sandstone exhibits a sequence of upward-steepening planar laminations capped at the top by a set of small-scale wedge planar cross-laminations. The sharply defined, parallel lamina are less than 5 mm thick and are commonly inversely graded and contain probable vadose meniscus carbonate cements. This facies is interpreted to have been deposited in a backshore coastal dune environment. The unit is characterized by low-angle (<20degrees dip) climbing translatent strata commonly produced by the migration of wind ripples along a dune. No fossils or trace fossils are found within this facies. Eolian-deposited sandstone is a potential reservoir rock along the updip limit of the Smackover Formation in west-central Mississippi. Other paleohighs along the Jurassic shoreline may have undergone similar eolian deposition during a regional sea level fall. Eolian-deposited sandstones on these paleohighs should have similar reservoir properties as the sandstone at Tchula Lake field. 486 The updip Smackover Formation in west-central Mississippi is an underexplored horizon, and eolian-deposited reservoirs have strong potential as a new exploration target. The sea level fluctuation event associated with deposition at Tchula Lake field also has implications for exploration in Upper Jurassic sedimentary rocks across the entire United States Gulf Coast Basin and prompts a reevaluation of these reservoirs.																			0149-1423					MAR	2002	86	3					485	503																WOS:000174264900008

Real time currents in the harbors of the Great Lakes - A pilot project	2007 OCEANS, VOLS 1-5	OCEANS-IEEE				2007 OCEANS Conference	SEP 29-OCT 04, 2007	Vancouver, CANADA	MTS, IEEE, Canada, Oceanworks, ISE Grp Co, Sun Star Elect L P, KONGSBERG, IMAGENEX TECHNOL CORP, ONR, OPSI				NOAA's National Ocean Service's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) is responsible for ensuring safe maritime navigation and supporting efficient water-borne commerce. CO-OPS oceanographic and environmental data sets also benefit the National Weather Service, coastal zone managers and the engineering and surveying communities. In 2006, a new pilot project was introduced and implemented in the Great Lakes to measure currents in real time, horizontally across the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, and the Maumee River in Toledo, Ohio. This project provides CO-OPS with a variety of new opportunities to expand the National Current Observation Program (NCOP) to the freshwater environment; to enhance partnerships with the Great Lakes shipping community, City of Cleveland, private industry, and federal agencies; and to test a new platform design for a horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District. The pilots of the Lake Carriers and Lakes Pilots Associations requested assistance with navigating the Cuyahoga and Maumee Rivers where winds affect their transit through narrow bridge spans and around sharp bends. The real-time current data provides the pilots with advanced knowledge of the conditions to be expected while in transit, and thus affording them the opportunity to load the vessel accordingly before committing to the river. The pilots identified the narrowest channel of the Cuyahoga River at the Center Street swing bridge in Cleveland, Ohio as a place where real time current measurements would provide them with a worst-case scenario of current speed prior to entering the river. Another area identified by the pilots occurs as vessels inbound from Lake Erie must transit through a narrow span of a railroad swing bridge on the Maumee River as they approach the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) pier to offload their grain. Access to the latest six minute record of current speed and direction at ADM represents conditions just beyond the bridge spans and this allows the pilot to plan an approach through this area. The real time data (every 6 minutes) can be accessed by the public through the web on the Great Lakes Online web page (http://glakesonline.nos.noaa.gov/moncurrent.html). The data are also available via NOAA's Interactive Voice Response System at 301-713-9596. Data collection of current speed and direction started in July 2006 and continues to the present at both sites. A persistent pattern has been noted at the Cuyahoga River she where a seiche oscillates approximately every 1.5 hours unless sustained winds compromise the current flow. Flow is either inbound or outbound (towards the lake) at approximately 0.8 knots. There isn't a real-time water level station upstream of the Center Street swing bridge on the Cuyahoga River so an examination of the variation in volume flow from the downstream NOS water level station located in Lake Erie cannot be simultaneously compared to the current data. A significant feature of the acoustic signal attenuation was noted at the ADM pier last winter when water temperatures approached 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Normal maximum profiling ranges diminished as the temperature dropped and approached freezing. In addition, side lobe interference also increased with the drop in temperature. Other seasonal changes in speed, temperature, and spikes in the data due to wind events are observed as well. This pilot project may include a third horizontal current meter site at the head of the St. Clair River in the vicinity of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, Michigan in late 2007. Since this project is termed a pilot project, the addition of other current meter sites is dependent on follow-on funding from the US Congress or other sources.																			0197-7385		978-0-933957-37-4				2007							981	987																WOS:000256526300145
J	WIELAND, E; SANTSCHI, PH; BEER, J				WIELAND, E; SANTSCHI, PH; BEER, J			A MULTITRACER STUDY OF RADIONUCLIDES IN LAKE ZURICH, SWITZERLAND .2. RESIDENCE TIMES, REMOVAL PROCESSES, AND SEDIMENT FOCUSING	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Residence and settling times of particles and particle-reactive nuclides evaluated from in situ tracer studies can be used as diagnostic indicators of trace element pathways in lakes. Natural (e.g., Pb-210, Be-7, and Be-10) and artificial (i.e., Chernobyl Cs-137) radionuclide fluxes through Lake Zurich (at 50 and 130 m depth) from 1983 to 1987, atmospheric fluxes of the same nuclides and fluxes of Be-10 during 1987 allowed the calculation of nuclide residence times as well as particle settling and transit velocities in Lake Zurich. The residence time of Pb-210 in the lake is approximately 1 month and, hence, of the same order as the residence times of particles and stable Pb. Steady state residence times for Be-7 were calculated as 150-170 days, while non steady state, instantaneous removal residence times ranged from 50 to 800 days. Polonium 210 was removed from Lake Zurich with removal times of 10-26, months indicating slow removal processes or efficient recycling in the lake water. Transit velocities of particles, calculated from the attenuation of Chernobyl Cs-137 fluxes at 50 m and 130 m depth during early May 1986, were 17 m d-1, while 2-4.5 m d-1 was calculated as an effective settling velocity from the attenuation of Be-7 fluxes at 130 m depth as compared to 50 m depth. Model calculations reveal that the overall removal process of atmospherically deposited Be-7 from the water column to the sediments is mainly controlled by the adsorption/coagulation step and not by the rate of particle settling. Extra inputs of Be-10, Pb-210, or Cs-137 into the lower trap (i.e., "rebound flux"), originating from episodic lateral inputs of fine particles with a high content of Pb-210, Be-10, and Cs-137, were observed during the lake stratification period (i.e., summer). This novel observation of summertime radionuclide and sediment focusing is different from previously described wind-generated resuspension and focusing effects caused by river plumes and lake sediments during the stagnation period. Boundary and focusing effects for radionuclide-bearing particles are proposed to explain observed summertime enhancements of longer-lived nuclide fluxes at 130 m depth as well as the decrease in calculated effective settling velocities.

Location Surface water environments, Cameroon. Methods Qualitative plankton samples were collected in all types of surface water environments present, ranging from big lakes to water collected in rock crevices or fallen fruit cavities. A tow or hand-held plankton net of mesh size 100 mu m was used, and water volumes filtered were at least several m(3) in large water bodies, or half to whole water volume in small water bodies. Results We recorded 61 species (53 first records for the country), based on 700+ samples collected between September 1998 and March 2002. Anomopoda (92%) was the dominant order, followed by Ctenopoda (6.5%) and Cyclestherida (1.5%). Chydoridae (67%) was the most speciose family followed by Macrothricidae (6.5%) and Daphniidae (5%). Alona (11%) was the dominant genus followed by Chydorus (10%) and Pleuroxus (8%). Several species of Chydorinae, especially of the genus Pleuroxus, are shared with continental Eurasia-North America, but are absent from the Mediterranean and desert-steppe-savanna zones of Africa (boreal-tropical disjunction). Daphnia was absent, as in most tropical lowlands. No single species was really abundant, and a majority were rare to very rare, and of restricted occurrence within the rain forest patches. Comparing Africa, South America and Southeast Asia, we found a current total of 196 species for the combined rain forest areas, out of a world total of 500+ species. Systematic trends in richness at three taxonomic levels were the same for all continents: Anomopoda-Ctenopoda-Cyclestherida at ordinal level, Chydoridae-Daphniidae-Macrothricidae-Sididae at family level and Alona-Chydorus-Macrothrix-Diaphanosoma at genus level. Southeast Asia was richest (111 species, 14 endemics) with South America a close second (110 species, 27 endemics). Africa was the most species-poor (95 species, of which only 5 are endemics). Main conclusions We hypothesize that the post-Miocene cooling and aridization of the world climate hit the freshwater biota of Africa particularly hard, with more extinction here than elsewhere, and little recolonization. Most extinction occurred in the savanna-desert belt, and eight disjunct boreal species (four Pleuroxus, Picripleuroxus laevis, Kurzia latissima, Alonella exigua, and Monospilus dispar) survive morphologically unchanged since pre-Pleistocene times in the Cameroon rain forest. Slow evolution thus appears typical of these cyclic parthenogenetic branchiopods in which sexual recombination occurs only at intervals. Illustrative of the same slow evolution is the fact that the two endemic cladocerans of Cameroon (Nicsmirnovius camerounensis and Bryospilus africanus) belong to tropicopolitan genera of Gondwanan age.																			0305-0270	1365-2699				SEP	2005	32	9					1611	1620		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01280.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01280.x													WOS:000231394300011

The main emphasis was on phosphorus and nitrogen budgets and on the phytoplankton dynamics. Special attention was paid to internal P loading and blue-green algal blooms. The mean Tot-P load from agricultural land was 1.2 kg ha-1 a-1 in both basins and Tot-N loads were 19 kg ha-1 a-1 in L. Villikkalanjarvi and 12 kg ha-1 a-1 in L. Kotojarvi. The Tot-P input to L. Kotojarvi was on an average 0.62 g m-2 a-1 (per lake surface area), and the Tot-N input 9.1 g m-2 a-1. The corresponding inputs to L. Villikkalanjarvi were 3.1 and 57 g m-2 a-1, respectively. The annual variation followed the runoff volumes. About half of the Tot-P and one third of the Tot-N load was retained in L. Kotojarvi. In L. Villikkalanjarvi the retention was only 24-degrees for Tot-P and 19% for Tot-N. The difference was very probably due to a longer theoretical retention time in L. Kotojarvi. In L. Villikkalanjarvi the mean concentration of Tot-P was 120,ug l-1 and that of Tot-N 1700,ug l-1 and the corresponding figures in L. Kotojarvi 67 and 990 mug l-1, respectively. The mean chlorophyll a concentration was, however, higher in L. Kotojarvi (26 mug l-1) than in L. Villikkalanjarvi (20 mug l-1). This was probably due to an internal P load in L. Kotojarvi: in 1988 the internal load of dissolved P was estimated to be as much as twofold the external load. In L. Villikkalanjarvi the internal dissolved P load was only up to 50% of the external input. In L. Kotojarvi the high internal P load coupled with a low DIN:DIP ratio resulted in a strong blue-green algal bloom in the summer of 1988. In L. Villikkalanjarvi blue-green algae were observed only in small amounts. Even in August 1990, when the DIN:DIP ratio was low enough to favor the occurrence of blue-green algae, they contributed only up to 10- 15 % of the total phytoplankton biomass.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						359	369		10.1007/BF00026726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026726													WOS:A1994NB19800033
J	Heusser, CJ; Heusser, LE; Lowell, TV				Heusser, CJ; Heusser, LE; Lowell, TV			Paleoecology of the southern Chilean Lake District-Isla Grande de Chiloe during middle-late Llanquihue glaciation and deglaciation	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Subantarctic Parkland and Subantarctic-North Patagonian Evergreen Forest, embracing >40,000 C-14 years of middle and late Llanquihue glaciation, are reconstructed from pollen contained in multiple interdrift deposits and cores of lake sediments. The subantarctic plant communities at low elevations have since been replaced by temperate Valdivian Evergreen Forest. Data in support of the vegetation reconstruction derive from close-interval sampling (>1400 pollen analysed stratigraphic levels) and high-resolution chronology (>200 AMS and conventional radiocarbon-dated horizons). Pollen sequences are from 15 sites, eight of which are exposures and seven mires,located in relation to lobes of piedmont glaciers that occupied Lago Llanquihue, Seno Reloncavi, Golfo de Ancud, and the east-central sector of Isla Grande de Chiloe at the northern limit of the Golfo Corcovado lobe. Recurring episodes of grass maxima representing Subantarctic Parkland,when grass and scrub became widespread among patches of southern beech (Nothofagus), bear a relationship to glacial advances. The implication of the maxima, prominent with advances at 22,400 and 14,800 C-14 yr sp during late Llanquihue glaciation in marine oxygen-isotope Stage 2, is of successive intervals of cold climate with summer temperatures estimated at 6-8 degrees C below the modem mean. The earliest recorded maximum at >50,000 C-14 yr sp is possibly during late Stage 4. At the time of middle Llanquihue glaciation in Stage 3,cool, humid interstades on Isla Grande de Chiloe with Subantarctic Evergreen Forest, which under progressive cooling after 47,000 C-14 yr sp was increasingly replaced by parkland. During stepwise deglaciation, when transitional beech woodland communities supplanting parkland became diversified by formation of thermophilous North Patagonian Evergreen Forest, warming in the order of 5-6 degrees C was abrupt after 14,000 C-14 yr BP. Closed-canopy North Patagonian Evergreen Forest was established by 12,500 C-14 yr sp. Later, after c. 12,000 until 10,000 C-14 yr sp, depending on location, forest at low elevations became modified by expansion of a cold-tolerant element indicative of less than or equal to 2-3 degrees C cooler climate. This stepwise climatic sequence is seen at all late-glacial sites. Cool, humid interstadial conditions, punctuated by cold stadial climate, are characteristic of the last >40,000 C-14 years of the Pleistocene at midlatitude in the Southern Hemisphere. Pollen sequences from southern South America and terrestrial-marine records from the New Zealand-Tasmania sector express a broad measure of synchrony of vegetational/climatic change for marine oxygen-isotope Stages 2-3. The data, combined with the timing of glacial maxima in the Southern Andes, Southern Alps of New Zealand, and in the Northern Hemisphere, are indicative of synchronous, millennial-scale, midlatitude climatic changes in the polar hemispheres.

J	Welsh, HH Jr; Pope, KL; Boiano, D				Welsh, HH Jr; Pope, KL; Boiano, D			Sub-alpine amphibian distributions related to species palatability to non-native salmonids in the Klamath mountains of northern California	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												The goal of this study was to examine how introduced trout influence the distributions and abundances of a sub-alpine amphibian assemblage whose members display a variety of different life-history and defence strategies. Our study was conducted in the sub-alpine lentic habitats of three wilderness areas that form the core of the Klamath-Siskiyou Bioregion of northern California, a biodiversity 'hotspot' that supports the highest diversity of sub-alpine, lentic-breeding amphibians in the western USA. These wilderness areas contain no native fishes, but all have been populated with non-native trout for recreational fishing. Five of the eight amphibian species that occur in this region were sufficiently common to use in our study; these included one that breeds in both temporary and permanent waters and is palatable to fish (Pacific treefrog, Pseudacris regilla), two that breed primarily in permanent waters and are unpalatable to fish (western toad, Bufo boreas, and rough-skinned newt, Taricha granulosa), and two that breed primarily in permanent waters and are palatable to fish (Cascades frog, Rana cascadae, and long-toed salamander, Ambystoma macrodactylum). Based on life histories and predator defence strategies (i.e. palatable or not), we predicted that the three palatable species would likely be negatively correlated with introduced trout, but with P. regilla less impacted because of its use of both temporary and permanent waters. We predicted that B. boreas and T. granulosa would not be significantly correlated with introduced trout due to the lack of any predator/prey interactions between them. We surveyed 728 pond, lake, or wet meadow sites during the summers of 1999-2002, using timed gill-net sets to measure trout occurrence and relative density, and visual encounter surveys to determine amphibian presence and abundance. We used semiparametric logistic regression models to quantify the effect of trout presence/absence and density on the probability of finding amphibian species in a water body while accounting for variation within and among the various lentic habitats sampled. The distributions of P. regilla, A. macrodactylum and R. cascadae were strongly negatively correlated with trout presence across all three wilderness areas. Ambystoma macrodactylum was 44 times more likely to be found in lakes without fish than in lakes with fish. Rana cascadae and P. regilla were 3.7 and 3.0 times more likely, respectively, to be found in fishless than fish-containing waters. In contrast, the two unpalatable species were either uncorrelated (T. granulosa) or positively correlated (B. boreas) with fish presence. We found that the relative density of fish (catch per unit effort) was negatively correlated with the combined abundances of the three palatable amphibians, and also with both the length and the condition of the fish themselves. Our results are consistent with a compelling body of evidence that introduced fishes greatly alter the aquatic community structure of mountain lakes, ponds, and wet meadows.																			1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2006	12	3					298	309		10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00254.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00254.x													WOS:000237095500008
J	Nguyen, DN; Kumakura, M; Kudo, S; Esteban, M; Onuki, M				Nguyen, David N.; Kumakura, Moe; Kudo, Shogo; Esteban, Miguel; Onuki, Motoharu			Overcoming negative disaster images: how Fukushima's sake breweries challenged negative stereotypes and rebuilt its regional brand	JOURNAL OF TOURISM FUTURES												Purpose - This study adopts the multi-step model developed by Avraham and Ketter (2008), for altering place images, based on past academic literature on destination marketing. The purpose of this study is to determine the state of Fukushima's sake breweries before and after 2011, and its strategies for overcoming negative images and strengthening regional branding. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven sake breweries in Fukushima. Design/methodology/approach - Fukushima Prefecture, located in northern Japan, is renowned for its hot springs, lakes, historical architecture, gastronomy, and particularly its sake (or Japanese rice wine). However, pre-existing problems such as the prefecture's changing demographics and economic development, the effects of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) and fears of radioactive contamination have made consumers reluctant to consume products from the region or to visit the prefecture. This study illustrates how various sake brewery stakeholders have sought to reverse and alter negative images associated with the prefecture. To examine these initiatives, this study uses the multi-step destination marketing and counter-branding model to identify the strategies and techniques used by the stakeholders, with the aim of altering the way the prefecture is perceived and reversing the negative image people may have of the prefecture. To acquire data for this model, this study uses semi-structured interviews conducted in 2018 and 2020 with local sake breweries, tourism associations and the local government on how they sought to retore a positive image of the prefecture and rebrand it into a new type of tourism destination that focuses on the strengths of its breweries. Findings - The results indicate that through a combination of collaboration between the breweries, local government and the local communities, the sake breweries were able to reverse many of the negative effects of the 2011 GEJE. The success of the sake industry has prompted the local government to focus more strongly on tourism marketing that places sake products and breweries at the center of its campaign to promote the region. Research limitations/implications - While this paper focuses on the recovery of breweries, it does not include the recovery of wineries in Fukushima, which have made similar progress in their recovery. In addition, the interviews focused primarily on the perspectives of the suppliers and not the consumers. Practical implications - The results of this research can help guide other destinations undergoing prolonged association with negative images on the path toward image recovery. In particular, this paper highlights the importance of a coordinated strategy by all stakeholders, the local government, businesses and communities, to create a united image and response for addressing the causes of these image problems and to create new opportunities for all stakeholders. Originality/value - This research contributes to the field of image restoration, which combines theories regarding destination marketing and crisis management. Also, the research highlights the importance of collective stakeholder mobilization when attempting to help communities that are facing economic and tourism crises.

J	Sandiford, A; Alloway, B; Shane, P				Sandiford, A; Alloway, B; Shane, P			A 28 000-6600 cal yr record of local and distal volcanism preserved in a paleolake, Auckland, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												A 52.5 in core was extracted from Pukaki Crater, an infilled basaltic explosion crater in the Auckland Volcanic Field, for detailed tephra and palynological analysis, The core consists of a lower 6 in of finely laminated lacustrine sediments representing the interval c. 28 000-6600 cal yr overlain by 46.5 in of homogeneous marine silts deposited between c. 7600 and 6600 cat yr. Favourable conditions have preserved at least 40 tephra layers in the sediments. These have been derived from one local and five distal sources and were deposited within the crater lake between c. 28 000 and c. 7600 cat yr. The tephra beds were identified by stratigraphic position, geochemical analyses, and ferromagnesian mineral assemblage. This tephrostratigraphic framework is underpinned by three distinctive tephra beds, namely Tuhua (c. 6950 cat yr), Rotoma (c. 9500 cat yr), and Kawakawa (c. 26 500 cat yr). Of the 40 tephra beds, 7 are sourced from the rhyolitic Okataina Volcanic Centre (Mamaku c. 8200 cat yr; Rotoma c. 9500 cat yr; Waiohau c. 13 800 cat yr; Rotorua c. 15 800 cat yr; Rerewhakaaitu c. 17 700 cal yr; Okareka c. 21 400 cat yr; Te Rere c. 25 000 cat yr), 3 from the rhyolitic Taupo Volcanic Centre (Opepe c. 10 200 cat yr; Kawakawa c. 26 500 cat yr; Poihipi c. 27 500 cat yr), 5 from the andesitic Tongariro Volcanic Centre, 14 from the andesitic Taranaki Volcano, I from Mayor Island (Tuhua c. 6950 cat yr), and 8 from the basaltic Auckland Volcanic Field. In addition, two previously unidentified rhyolitic tephra (c. 17 100 cat yr and c. 20 720 cal yr) are recorded. The occurrence of numerous andesitic and rhyolitic tephra beds in the Auckland region extends the known dispersal of the units and has implications for the assessment of volcanic hazards from distal sources. Many of the Taranaki-derived tephra beds do not stratigraphically match those recorded in the Waikato lakes region and this suggests that Taranaki Volcano produced more ash than previously estimated. The distal tephra record preserved at Pukaki provides age constraints for Auckland Volcanic Field basaltic tephra that are otherwise poorly dated. Basaltic fall events are recorded at c. 14 450 cal yr, 15 750 cat yr, 19 380 cat yr, 19 420 cat yr, 23 825 cat yr, 24 175 cat yr, 25 200 cat yr, and 25 700 cat yr. Fresh glass in the basaltic tephra allows them to be chemically fingerprinted and discriminated, and this will open a new avenue to development of a regional basaltic tephrostratigraphy.

J	McCarthy, PJ; Faccini, UF; Plint, AG				McCarthy, PJ; Faccini, UF; Plint, AG			Evolution of an ancient coastal plain: palaeosols, interfluves and alluvial architecture in a sequence stratigraphic framework, Cenomanian Dunvegan Formation, NE British Columbia, Canada	SEDIMENTOLOGY												To date, discussion of changes in alluvial style and in the character of palaeosols in relation to changes in accommodation and sediment supply on floodplains has primarily been from a conceptual standpoint: few case studies are available against which to test ideas. One hundred and thirty metres of non-marine strata of the Dunvegan Formation were examined in 14 closely spaced sections in the canyon of the Kiskatinaw River, NE British Columbia, Canada. This site was located about 120 km inland from the transgressive limit of the contemporary marine shoreline and represents almost exclusively freshwater environments. Fluvial channels in the Kiskatinaw River section are of two types. Small, single-storey, very fine- to fine-grained sandstone ribbons with W/T ratios <30, encased in fine-grained floodplain sediments are interpreted as anastomosed channels. Fine- to medium-grained, laterally accreted point-bar deposits forming multistorey sand bodies with individual W/T ratios >30 are interpreted as the deposits of meandering rivers filling incised valleys. Interchannel facies include the deposits of crevasse channels and splays, lakes, floodplains and palaeosols. Floodplain palaeosols consist of laterally heterogeneous, simple palaeosol profiles and pedocomplexes similar to modern Entisols, Inceptisols and hydromorphic soils. Interfluve, sequence-bounding palaeosols adjacent to incised valleys are laterally continuous, up to 3 m thick and can be reliably identified using a combination of (1) stratigraphic position; (2) field observations, such as thickness, structure, colour, degree of rooting; and (3) micromorphological features, such as evidence of bioturbation, clay coatings, ferruginous features and sphaerosiderite. Interfluve palaeosols are similar to modern Alfisols and Ultisols. Correlation of the local stratigraphic succession with the regional sequence stratigraphic framework, based on 2340 well logs and 60 outcrop sections, shows that the vertical changes in coastal plain character (more coals and lakes vs. more pedogenesis) can be related to relatively high-frequency base level cycles (eustatic?) that are expressed as transgressive-regressive marine cycles in downdip areas. Regional isopach maps show that these cycles were progressively overprinted and modified by an increasing rate of tectonic subsidence in the north and west. The character of palaeosols developed on aggrading floodplains primarily reflects local sediment supply and drainage. In contrast, well-developed interfluve palaeosols record pedogenesis during periods of reduced or negative accommodation (base level fall). Vertical changes in floodplain palaeoenvironments and palaeosol types reflect changes in accommodation rate. The detailed micromorphological analysis of interfluve palaeosols represents a powerful application of an under-used technique for the recognition of key surfaces in the geological record. This has broad implications for non-marine sequence stratigraphy.

J	Van den Berg, MS; Joosse, W; Coops, H				Van den Berg, MS; Joosse, W; Coops, H			A statistical model predicting the occurrence and dynamics of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian				Logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between six submerged macrophyte taxa (Chara spp., Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton pectinatus, Potamogeton pusillus, Myriophyllum spicatum, Alisma gramineum and sum of all species) and four environmental variables (turbidity, effective wind fetch, water depth and sediment silt percentage, including interactions and some quadratic terms). The models were based on intensive vegetation samples (total c. 72 000) and other monitoring data carried out in five Dutch shallow lakes in the Usselmeer area from 1988 to 1998. Water depth and light extinction were the most important factors determining the occurrence of all studied species in Veluwemeer, while effective wind fetch had a moderate effect and sediment silt had only a minor effect on the occurrence. Water depth had a negative impact on all species, except A. gramineum, which showed an optimum response. Three species showed an optimum response at intermediate turbidity (M. spicatum, R pusillus and P. pectinatus), whereas the other taxa were negatively related. Three species (Chara spp., R perfioliatus and M. spicatum) were positively related to wind fetch or showed an optimum response at intermediate value, whereas P. pusillus, P. pectinatus and A. gramineum were negatively related. The models including interactions between the explanatory variables showed a high goodness of fit for Veluwemeer for Chara, R pectinatus and M. spicatum (in more than 8 of 10 instances, a cell originally scored '1' are predicted to have a higher probability than the ones originally scored V). The models of the other species showed a moderate goodness of fit (between 6 and 8 of 10 instances correctly predicted). The models developed for Veluwemeer were valid for Chara in all the four other lakes (more than 8 of 10 instances correctly predicted), while the models of other species were valid in some instances. A succession of vegetation was recognised based on water depth and turbidity in Veluwemeer. P. perfoliatus and P. pectinatus dominated the shallow zones under turbid conditions, but a change to dominance by Chara occurred in clear water. Based on the observation of co-occurrence, competition has played an important role for the shift from P. pectinatus to Chara. Chara became dominant 2 years after initial colonisation of Chara in P. pectinatus beds. Competition between P. perfoliatus and Chara may have been of less importance, due to a more distinct habitat (deeper colonisation) of dense P. perfoliatus beds. The analysed species showed large differences in vegetation stability from year-to-year.

Species producing specialized vegetative propagules for over wintering showed a higher local stability than species without such propagules.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					611	623		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008610.97044.39	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008610.97044.39													WOS:000188455600080

Thirty-two physical and chemical variables, including pH, alkalinity, cations and metal concentrations were measured on samples from the epilimnion and hypolimnion of each lake. In three lakes, two to four replicate cores were collected to estimate spatial variability of the sediment flora. All lakes were acidic (pH 4.59 to 5.80), highly colored and poorly buffered. Aluminum and magnesium concentrations reached 494 and 70 .mu.g l-1, respectively. The pH of the lakes appears to be declining, as indicated by a comparison of our results with those from a survey done in 1970. An empirical chemical model based on the alkalinity/sulfate ratio and the regression of pH on calcium also indicated that these lakes may be undergoing acidification. Analyses of the diatom flora of the surficial sediments showed strong dominance of 6 species that cooccurred with a large number of rare species (in all, 229 taxa were found). Variability among samples within a lake was as high as among lakes. Calculation of Nygaard''s alpha index for each sample and the regression of its log-transformed value on surface pH yielded a relationship that was significantly from other published models. The regression model was applied to a down-core analysis of the diatom flora of the sediments of two lakes. Although the large confidence intervals on pH values predicted by the model obscured any evidence of pH change with sediment depth, there was a significant increase of acidophilous and a decrease of circumneutral species over time, suggesting that a change in the flora, possibly correlated with pH, is taking place. In making comparisons among lakes, the surficial-sediment flora did not provide clear evidence of a relationship with the pH of surface water. Indices computed from the surficial-sediment flora are apparently insensitive to differences in pH over a narrow range, particularly when the lakes being compared are similar chemically. Nygaard''s alpha index is shown to be unduly sensitive to outliers. The currently accepted assumption of a progressive linear change in communities may be inadequate for the quantification of acidification processes. Other models, derived from catastrophe theory may prove more fruitful.

Pickle Lake revisited: New structural, geochronological and geochemical constraints on Greenstone belt assembly, western Superior Province, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												New field work, U - Pb ages, geochemical data, and Sm - Nd isotopic analyses have established the timing and determined the nature of volcanism, deformation, and tectonic assembly of the Pickle Lake greenstone belt in the Uchi subprovince of the western Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The > 2860 Ma Pickle Crow assemblage has been redefined to include the former Northern Pickle assemblage on the basis of stratigraphic continuity and similar volcanic geochemistry between the two units across a previously inferred fault contact. The Pickle Crow assemblage consists of tholeiitic basalt with thin, but laterally extensive, oxide-facies iron formation overlain by alkalic basalts and minor calcalkaline andesites to dacites with primitive Nd isotopic compositions (epsilon(2.89 Ga)(Nd) = + 2.1 to + 2.4) suggestive of deposition in a sediment-starved oceanic basin. The similar to 2 km thick similar to 2836 Ma Kaminiskag assemblage ( former Woman assemblage) consists of tholeiitic basalt interbedded with intermediate and rare felsic pyroclastic flows with primitive Nd isotopic compositions (epsilon(2.836 Ga)(Nd) = + 2.4). Two samples of intermediate volcanic rocks interbedded with southeast-younging pillowed basalt, previously inferred to be part of the Pickle Crow assemblage, yielded U - Pb zircon ages of 2744(-2)(+3) Ma and 2729 +/- 3 Ma. These rocks are thus part of the younger Confederation assemblage, which consists of intercalated basalt and dacite (epsilon(2.74 Ga)(Nd) = + 0.1 to + 0.8) exhibiting diverse compositions probably reflecting eruption in a continental margin arc to back-arc setting. The contact between the Confederation and Kaminiskag assemblages is assumed to be a fault. The greenstone belt is intruded by late syn- to posttectonic plutons including the composite quartz dioritic to gabbroic July Falls stock with a new U - Pb zircon age of 2749(-2)(+4) Ma, and the -2741 to 2740 Ma trondhjemitic to granodioritic Ochig Lake pluton and Pickle Lake stock, as well as the similar to 2697 to 2716 Ma Hooker - Burkoski stock. The earliest recognized deformation (D-1) is recorded by a local bedding-parallel foliation in the Pickle Crow assemblage. This foliation is truncated by the similar to 2735 Ma Albany quartz - feldspar porphyry dyke and is not recognized in the volcanic rocks of the Confederation assemblage. The early deformation event is attributed to overturning of the Pickle Crow assemblage prior to deposition of the similar to 2744 to 2729 Ma Confederation assemblage. Subsequent deformation and development of a regionally penetrative planar fabric (S-2) postdates similar to 2729 Ma volcanism, pre-dates the intrusion of the ca. < 2716 Ma Hooker - Burkoski stock and is host to gold mineralization.																			0008-4077					JUL	2006	43	7					821	847		10.1139/E06-036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E06-036													WOS:000241582600006

High-resolution mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes	NATURE												The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity(1) and affects climate(2,3), biological diversity(4) and human wellbeing(5,6). Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions(7), statistical extrapolation of regional data(8) and satellite imagery(9-12), but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images(13), we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change(14) is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal(15,16). Losses in Australia(17) and the USA(18) linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.

RETRACTED: Growth, destruction and facies architecture of effusive and explosive volcanics in the Miocene Shama basin, southwest of Saudi Arabia: Subaqueous-subaerial volcanism in a lacustrine setting (Retracted Article)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Harrat Shama Volcanic Basin (HSVB) is a part of a small, well-exposed intra-continental extensional basin that formed during the opening of the Red Sea, containing 5 km of Miocene bimodal volcanics and volcaniclastic rocks. The Shama basin accumulated a thick fluvio-lacustrine fill in which two distinct volcanic sequences and their deposits can overlap with each other. In addition, complete facies architectures of the Shama volcanics have been recognized providing a complex mixed siliciclastic and volcaniclastic basin infill in the respective basin where volcanism took place. The lower sequence is composed of hyaloclastites, zeolite-bearing bedded tuffs, and bedded accretionary-lapilli-tuffs and an upper sequence, is made up of pumiceous lapilli-tuffs and peperitic breccias capped by basaltic lava flows. The former is interpreted to have been dominated by discrete, phreatomagmatic fall deposits, which are attributed to an overall high eruption rate in a lacustrine setting, followed by a dominantly subaerial pumiceous lapilli tuff deposits and volcaniclastic sediments sited in the upper part of the basin with paleosols and/or fluvial deposits in between the two sequences. These deposits could be related to polygenetic volcanoes and tectonic structures, such as faults and rift-zones. These two sequences display a complex succession of effusive and explosive volcanisms and their reworked deposits, with abundant evidences of magma-water interaction such as peperites for non-explosive magma-water interaction with the lacustrine water-saturated sediment and standing water body in a lake environment. The difference eruption dynamics and fragmentation mechanisms between the two sequences reflect progressive environmental changes from subaqueous or watery to subaerial or dry. Fluvial erosion and deposition completed the evolution of the emergent marginal part of the Shama basin. The Shama basin then experienced volcano growth and degradation that formed the two sequences; NW-SEtrending basement faulting triggered multiple flank collapses and volcanic debris avalanches, and voluminous pumiceous lapilli-tuff eruptions produced a caldera (upper sequence). Lacustrine conditions persisted during the destruction and post-destruction stages of the volcano's evolution, as evidenced by magma-water interactions. Shama basin is a small-volume volcano, similar to tuff rings; however, its magma compositions, complex eruption styles, and inter-eruptive breaks suggest, that it closely resembles a volcanic architecture commonly associated with large, composite volcanoes. The main cause of such complex eruptive behavior resides in the stratigraphic, structural, and hydrogeological characteristics of the substrate above which the volcanoes were emplaced, rather than on the compositional characteristics of the erupting magma, which do not show significant variation among the different deposits.

J	GLASHEEN, JS; HAND, SC				GLASHEEN, JS; HAND, SC			METABOLIC HEAT DISSIPATION AND INTERNAL SOLUTE LEVELS OF ARTEMIA-EMBRYOS DURING CHANGES IN CELL-ASSOCIATED WATER	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp Artemia enter a profound, yet reversible, state of metabolic arrest in response to cellular dehydration. We have monitored metabolic activity during this transition embryos from the Great Salt Lake [Utah, USA] population by using microcalorimetric measurements of heat dissipation. Embryo hydration state can be precisely controlled by immersing cysts in solutions of varying ionic strength. When developing embryos were incubated in a 2.0 mol l-1 NaCl solution, heat dissipation fell after 20 h to 1.13 mW g-1 dry mass, or 21% of the value obtained when embryos were in control solutions of 0.25 mol l-1. At higher ionic concentrations, heat dissipation declined to as low as 3% of control values. Recovery from dehydration was rapid. Energy flow increased to 135% of control values within 2 h after returning cysts to the control medium. These metabolic transitions were correlated with embryo hydration levels measured across the same dehydration series. Total cyst water ranged from 112 .+-. 2.6 g H2O 100 g-1 dry mass in 0.25 mol l-1 NaCl to 46 .+-. 0.6 H2O 100 g-1 dry mass in 5.0 mol l-1 NaCl. At the first point where heat dissipation was markedly suppressed (the 2.0 mol l-1 incubation), cyst water content was 72.8 .+-. 0.9 gH2O 100 g-1 dry mass. This water content is similar to the ''critical'' hydration level required to suppress carbohydrate catabolism and respiration in San Franscisco Bay Artemia embryos (Clegg, 1967a, b). However, hydration characteristics of the two populations differred in solutions of lower ion in concentration. Total osmotic pressure in fully hydrated cysts was 1300 mosmol kg-1 H2O. A comprehensive inventory of the internal osmolytes indicated that inorganic ions (Na+, K+, Cl-, Mg2+, Ca2+, Pi) accounted for 21% of the osmotic activity and 1.48% of embryo dry mass. Organic solutes (trehalose, glycerol, ninhydrin-positive substances, and trimethylamine-N-oxide+betaine) contributed 60% of the osmotic pressure and 22% of the dry mass. Macromolecular components (protein, lipids, glycogen and DNA) were also quantified and formed the bulk of embryo mass. Taken together, 97.4% of the cyst dry mass was identified. At the cellular dehydation state promoting metabolic arrest, the concentrations of inorganic and organic osmolytes were 480-590 mmol kg-1 H2O and 1200-1480 mmol kg-1 H2O, respectively. The influence of these osmolyte concentrations is considered in the context of macromolecular assembly and metabolic control.																			0022-0949	1477-9145				SEP	1989	145						263	282																WOS:A1989AP01200019

The lake was formed in a tectonic depression associated with the Aguascalientes graben and the Teocaltiche half-graben. Sediments accumulated inside this continental basin are epiclastic, mainly derived from volcanic rocks of the SMOc, and from the volcanic cover of the Mesa Central, chemical and biochemical precipitates (fresh water limestone), and mixed sediments, as well as far less voluminous, but ubiquitous, volcanic ash-fall layers, which were used to obtain U-Pb ages from zircons. The age range of the basin-fill sediments is broad, varying from Rupelian (similar to 28.6 Ma) to Tortonian (similar to 7.6 Ma). Previously, on the basis of fossil fauna, the succession was considered only as late Miocene in age. The southern end of the SMOc includes several NNE-trending basins of tectonic origin that contained lakes. Based on the characteristics of the individual sedimentary successions, and on their fossil faunas, it is known that three of these basins (Tlaltenango, Juchipila and Teocaltiche) had lakes at the same time. The fourth basin, the Bolanos graben, located west and parallel to the Tlaltenango basin, probably also had a lake during the Neogene, but almost all its sediments have been eroded, so that little is known about them. In order to explain the simultaneous partial closure of all the drainage systems a common, regional, cause must be invoked. All the tectonic basins in the southern part of the SMOc end close to the tectonic depressions related to either the Tepic-Zacoalco or Tula-Chapala rifts. Isostatic uplift of the foot wall blocks of these similar to E-W- trending rifts may have provoked partial closure of hydrologic systems within the NNE-trending grabens. It is not known when the basins were opened and ceased to act as aggrading systems, but the apparent absence of Blancan age fossils within them may indicate that they could have been opened prior to similar to 4.75 Ma, which is the numerical value of the beginning of this faunal stage. A probable common cause for the simultaneous opening could be a marine invasion in the region now occupied by the Gulf of California. The new base level of erosion probably increased the stream gradients in the fluvial systems, providing enough energy to the axial rivers within the grabens to overcome the uplift associated with similar to E-W rift activity.

J	Brosse, S; Lek, S; Dauba, F				Brosse, S; Lek, S; Dauba, F			Predicting fish distribution in a mesotrophic lake by hydroacoustic survey and artificial neural networks	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The present work describes the development and validation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) by comparison with classical and more advanced parametric and nonparametric statistical modeling methods such as Multiple Regression (MR), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Alternating Conditional Expectations (ACE) to estimate spatial distribution of fish in a mesotrophic reservoir. The modeling approaches were developed and tested using 60 hydroacoustic transects covering the whole lake. Each transect was divided into 100-m-long sections, constituting a total of 732 sampling units. For each of them, the relationships between topology, chemical characteristics, and fish abundance were studied. The models had six independent topological (i.e., depth, distance from the bank, slope, and stratum) and chemical (i.e., temperature and dissolved oxygen) variables and one dependent output variable (fish density, FD). The data matrix was divided into two parts. The first contained units where FD was nonnil (i.e., 399 sampling units), and the second contained only cases without fish (i.e., 333 sampling units). Model training and testing procedures were run on the first submatrix after log(FD + 1) transformation. As linear MR results were not satisfactory (r(2) = 0.42 in the training set, and r(2) = 0.51 in the testing set) compared with ANN (r(2) = 0.81 in the training set, and r(2) = 0.77 in the testing set), we tried nonlinear transformations of the variables such as logarithmic, lowess (for the GAM), and an optimal nonlinear transformation using the SAS Transreg procedure (for the ACE model), but the determination coefficients remained clearly lower than those obtained using ANN (r(2) = 0.60 in the training set for ACE, and r(2) = 0.66 in the training set for GAM). The results of a second test on the nil submatrix stressed that, compared with other statistical techniques, ANN and, to a certain extent, GAM models were able to clearly define the potential FDs in samples where no fish were actually found. The model showed, on the basis of the topological and chemical variables taken into account, that the predicted potential FDs in the surface stratum are higher than in the underlying stratum. Finally, on the basis of the sensitivity analyses performed on the ANN and GAM results, we established relationships between FDs and the six environmental variables. Our results exhibit a clear summer habitat preferendum, the fish (predominantly roach) being located mainly in the surface stratum, in the warm shallow littoral areas. These observations led us to discuss the ecological significance of such a fish distribution, which may be due to a trade-off between feeding, predation avoidance, and endogenous fish requirements.

J	Bashinskiy, IV				Bashinskiy, Ivan, V			BEAVER IMPACT ON WATER COVERAGE OF FOREST-STEPPE TERRITORIES (PENZA REGION, EUROPEAN RUSSIA)	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The impact of the European beaver (Castor fiber) on the water coverage of natural territories was assessed by analysing public available satellite images. Four model squares with a total area of 900 km(2) were chosen, with coverage of the vicinity of four sectors of the Privolzhskaya Lesostep' State Nature Reserve (Penza region). This study showed that modern public satellite images can clearly distinguish beaver ponds even of small sizes, as well as elements of their activity, namely beaver dams, canals and tracks. We identified 373 water bodies that were made by beavers, with an average area of 1040 +/- 4843 m(2), 107 man-made ponds (average area 24 272 +/- 65 977 m(2)), and 67 lakes and oxbows (average area 8127 +/- 17 946 m(2)). The proportion of zoogenic ponds was 11% of the total area and 68% of the total number. In certain study sites, these values varied from 7% to 18% (for the area) and from 44% to 84% (for the number). But within the boundaries of the Privolzhskaya Lesostep' State Nature Reserve, where there were no man-made water bodies, the proportion of beaver ponds reached 100% in three sectors. The total water body' area percentage of the studied territories was 0.39%. In different sites, beavers increased the proportion of water bodies by 0.02-0.10%, in total by 0.04%. If we consider only the area of natural water bodies, then beavers increased it in 1.7 times, while within the boundaries of the Privolzhskaya Lesostep' State Nature Reserve this increase was 3.6 times. Since the water coverage of the central regions of European Russia was considerably increased due to the construction of man-made ponds, this could affect the structure of habitats in the floodplains of small rivers, and favour the activity of beavers in the forest-steppe regions. Therefore, there was a slight correlation between the number and area of beaver ponds and the size of downstream man-made water bodies. Our data have shown that the zoogenic contribution to water resources is comparable to the contribution of natural lakes and ponds. In some areas with low anthropogenic impact, water bodies created by beavers are the only lentic habitats in the landscape. However, the obtained results do not completely cover the real beaver impact, since narrow channel-like ponds hidden by the canopy of floodplain trees fall out of analysis. It is impossible to take into account the length of the backwater zone with a cascade of zoogenic water bodies, neither is it possible to remotely assess the contribution of animals to the retention capacity of old man-made ponds, and the role of the ecological engineer in maintaining and increasing the surface area of pre-existing lakes. Therefore, the contribution of beavers to the water coverage of the territory is actually more remarkable.

J	Vachier, C; Meyer, F				Vachier, C; Meyer, F			The viscous watershed transform	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION												The watershed transform is the basic morphological tool for image segmentation. Watershed lines, also called divide lines, are a topographical concept: a drop of water failing on a topographical surface follows a steepest descent line until it stops when reaching a regional minimum. Falling on a divide line, the same drop of water may glide towards one or the other of both adjacent catchment basins. For segmenting an image, one takes as topographic surface the modulus of its gradient: the associated watershed lines will follow the contour lines in the initial image. The trajectory of a drop of water is disturbed if the relief is not smooth: it is undefined for instance on plateaus. On the other hand, each regional minimum of the gradient image is the attraction point of a catchment basin. As gradient images generally present many minima, the result is a strong oversegmentation. For these reasons a more robust scheme is used for the construction of the watershed based on flooding: a set of sources are defined, pouring water in such a way that the altitude of the water increases with constant speed. As the flooding proceeds, the boundaries of the lakes propagate in the direction of the steepest descent line of the gradient. The set of. points where lakes created by two distinct sources meet are the contours. As the sources are far less numerous than the minima, there is no more oversegmentation. And on the plateaus the flooding also is well defined and propagates from the boundary towards the inside of the plateau. Used in conjunction with markers, the watershed is a powerful, fast and robust segmentation method. Powerful: it has been used with success in a variety of applications. Robust: it is insensitive to the precise placement or shape of the markers. Fast: efficient algorithms are able to mimic the progression of the flood. In some cases however the resulting segmentation will be poor: the contours always belong to the watershed lines of the gradient and these lines are poorly defined when the initial image is blurred or extremely noisy. In such cases, an additional regularization has to take place. Denoising and filtering the image before constructing the gradient is a widely used method. It is however not always sufficient. In some cases, one desires smoothing the contour, despite the chaotic fluctuations of the watershed lines. For this two options are possible. The first consists in using a viscous fluid for the flooding: a viscous fluid will not be able to follow all irregularities of the relief and produce lakes with smooth boundaries. Simulating a viscous fluid is however computationally intensive. For this reason we propose an alternative solution, in which the topographic surface is modified in such a way that flooding it with a non viscous fluid will produce the same lakes as flooding the original relief with a viscous fluid. On this new relief, the standard watershed algorithm can be used, which has been optimized for various architectures. Two types of viscous fluids will be presented, yielding two distinct regularization methods. We will illustrate the method on various examples.

Lake levels have fluctuated to a considerable extent in the late Pleistocene. Although tectonism may have influenced earlier level changes, the more recent changes have been climatically controlled. Major recessions occurred in the period before 25000 years ago and 10740 .+-. 130 years ago, with further large falls between 1150 and 1250 A.D. and within the period 1500-1850. The 1500-1850 lake recession-refilling cycle is documented by using a variety of techniques. Sediment cores show an erosional hiatus stretching across the southern area of Lake Malawi down to water depths of at least 121 m. Diatoms sharply decline in abundance and diversity across this break, with Melosira nyassensis dominating in the post-erosion period. During the low stage, exposed littoral sands were reworked into aeolian dune-fields along windward shorelines. Oral histories reflect a group memory of this low period, which is supported by 14C dated archaeological finds in beach ridges surrounding the lake. Dating by 210Pb methods show that lacustrine sedimentation had resumed by about 1860. At this time, early explorers, such as Livingstone, were reporting evidence of rising lake levels. Hydrological modelling shows that the lake-level changes indicated are possible in the timespan available. Various permutations of rainfall and timescale are discussed, e.g. a drop of 110 m over 250 years would require rainfall at 50% of modern values. The changes in lake level imply long-term changes in climate; these are highly relevant in the field of drought-risk assessment. The species flock of rocky-shore dwelling Lake Malawi cichlids known as ''Mbuna'' contains about 200 species in Malawi''s waters. Mitochondrial DNA differentiation shows that the flock as a whole is of extremely recent origin. Almost every rocky outcrop and island has a unique Mbuna fauna, with endemic colour forms and species. As many of these islands and outcrops were dry land within the last 200-300 years, The establishment of the faunas has taken place within that time. The evolution of distinct forms in such a brief timespan is discussed in relation to current ideas on allopatric speciation. The present diversity of the Malawi cichlid-species flock, and particularly the Mbuna, may be readily explained by the rapidity with which small founder populations can diverge from the parent population, as demonstrated by the present chronological evidence on changes in lake levels and by the Mbuna distribution data. The repeated recessions and refillings of the lake have provided numerous opportunities for the establishment of different founder populations and consequently different selection pressures, leading to further bouts of speciation.

J	Kretz, R				Kretz, R			Mineral reactions at boundaries between amphibolite and marble in the southern Grenville Province, Quebec, Canada	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												In a high-grade metamorphic terrane north of Ottawa, in the southern Grenville Province of Quebec, numerous reaction-zones from 4 to 20 mm wide have formed at boundaries between amphibolite and marble. Rock compositions are used to identify elements that were added to or removed from two of these zones, and electron-microprobe data on minerals are used to construct reaction equations, which provide additional information on gains and losses. Near the village of Otter Lake, a K-feldspar-bearing amphibolite, composed of aluminous calcic amphibole [Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) = 0.66] and K-feldspar [Na/(Na + K) = 0.07] with minor titanite, reacted with calcite-quartz marble to produce a 6-mm zone of calcic pyroxene [Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) = 0.68] and scapolite [Ca/(Ca + Na + K) = 0.71: Cl:S:CO2 = 0.1:0.1:0.8]. Sodium, Cl, and S were introduced, and Fe, K, Rb, Ba, F, H2O and CO2 were removed. Near Gracefield, amphibolite composed of pargasitic amphibole [Mg/(Mg + Fe2+) = 0.50], plagioclase [Ca/(Na + Ca) = 0.20] and minor ilmenite reacted with calcite-dolomite marble to produce a 10-mm subzone of mainly amphibole [Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0.83, increasing toward marble to 0.87] and scapolite [Ca/(Na + Ca) = 0.37], with minor plagioclase [Ca/(Na + Ca) = 0.27] and calcite, and a 7-mm subzone (adjacent to marble) composed almost entirely of biotite [Mg/(Mg + Fe) = 0.87, increasing toward marble, to 0.92]. Here, K, P, Zn, Rb, Ba, Cl, and H2O were introduced, and Na, Sr, and CO2 were removed. Estimates of gains and losses per cm(3) of reaction zone (both occurrences) fall in the range of 9000 to 2000 mu mol for H2O and CO2, 2000 to 600 mu mol for Na, K, and Fe, and < 200 mu mol for trace elements. In the Otter Lake occurrence, approximately 3 mu mol of each of Si, Al, Fe, and Mg passed through the reaction zone from amphibolite to marble, relative to 12 mu mol of pyroxene produced, whereas 5 mu mol of Ca moved in the opposite direction. In reactions of the kind here described. the rate of migration of atoms that were added to the reaction sites, and the rate of migration of atoms through the reaction zones, have possibly both determined the overall rate of crystallization.																			0008-4476					APR	2005	43		2				569	583		10.2113/gscanmin.43.2.569	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gscanmin.43.2.569													WOS:000229824900004
J	Obertegger, U; Pindo, M; Flaim, G				Obertegger, Ulrike; Pindo, Massimo; Flaim, Giovanna			Do inferences about freshwater phytoplankton communities change when based on microscopy or high-throughput sequencing data?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Microscopy and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) detect and quantify algae differently. It is not known if microscopy-based abundance or biomass better compare to HTS data or how methodological differences affect ecological inferences about the phytoplankton communities studied. We investigated methodological (abundance(microscopy) vs. abundance(HTS), biomass(microscopy) vs. abundance(HTS)), habitat (littoral, pelagic, deep hypolimnion), and year (2014 vs. 2017) differences for phytoplankton communities of Lake Tovel (Italy) using ANOVA. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that depending on comparing abundance(microscopy) or biomass(microscopy) to abundance(HTS) different effects would be indicated; we called this the metric effect. Furthermore, using samples from 2014 to 2017, we investigated environment-community relationships by a redundancy analysis based on abundance(microscopy), biomass(microscopy), and abundance(HTS), and compared the results. Approximately 9 times more operational taxonomic units were reported with HTS (n(2014) = 819, n(2017) = 891) than algal taxa with microscopy (n(2014) = 90, n(2017) = 109) in 2014 and 2017. While microscopically assessed algal taxa were evenly distributed among phyla, the vast majority of operational taxonomic units were attributed to Chrysophyta (2014 = 54%, 2017 = 62%) and Bacillariophyta (2014 = 19%, 2017 = 17%). A metric effect for method differences was generally observed comparing abundance(microscopy) to abundance(HTS) with Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Dinophyta showing higher % abundance with microscopy while richness and Chrysophyta showed higher values with HTS. Almost no metric effects were found in 2014, but they were common across phyla in 2017. Bacillariophyta and Eustigmatophyta showed the same habitat differences when comparing biomass(microscopy) to abundance(HTS). Dinophyta showed habitat differences only with microscopy, while Chyrsophyta showed habitat differences only with HTS; these results were probably related to technical bias and strengths of HTS, respectively. Habitat differences of phyla were reasonably related to their ecological niche and linked to factors such as temperature and feeding preferences; furthermore, phyla often showed a significant 2014-versus-2017 year effect. The year 2014 was very wet while 2017 had a dry winter, and we attributed the patterns found to allochthonous nutrient input by rain and decreased turbulence. Redundancy analyses based on phytoplankton communities assessed with microscopy and HTS, respectively, equally indicated the importance of hydrology, nutrients, and temperature for phytoplankton communities and discriminated the littoral from the deep hypolimnion. However, variance explained was higher with HTS, and the pelagic was similar to the deep hypolimnion with microscopy but to the littoral with HTS. Despite the different strengths of microscopy and HTS for biodiversity assessment, both datasets outlined similar large-scale patterns linked to strong environmental control of phytoplankton communities as they related to habitat and year differences. According to our hypothesis, metric effects were common; however, no general rule was found as to whether abundance(microscopy) or biomass(microscopy) should be compared to abundance(HTS). Notwithstanding metric effects, HTS-based data provided similar and more detailed information than microscopy, supporting the promise of HTS becoming the tool of the future for biodiversity research.

J	CHANGNON, SA				CHANGNON, SA			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THUNDERSTORMS AND CLOUD-TO-GROUND LIGHTNING IN THE UNITED-STATES	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Data from networks of lightning sensors operated during 1986-89 were employed to perform climatic assessments of cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes, and of the relationship between CG flashes and thunder events, as reported at 62 first-order stations. The average annual CG flash pattern resembles the nation's thunderstorm pattern, with lightning being most frequent at points in the southeast United States (> 18 000 flashes in Florida) and least frequent at West Coast stations (< 100 flashes). Flashes in the intermontane area are relatively less than thunderstorms, and greater than 50% of all thunder events there are due to intracloud lightning. An anomalous high in CG frequencies exists from Virginia to New York. Cluster analysis identified ten regions of similar storm activity with several reflecting localized influences (Great Lakes, Florida, the Piedmont, and Arizona). Thunder events provide poor estimates of CG lightning incidences and durations. Cloud-to-ground flash data reveal that 20% (far West) and 50% (southeast United States) of all thunder events are missed at weather stations; 30%-60% of all thunder events have durations too short; 10% (North and West), 40% (mountains), and 25% (Southeast) of all CG flashes within 20 km of weather stations occur at times that are not reported as thunderstorms. The average annual point duration of thunderstorm activity, when based on thunder data, is underestimated by 23% (West Coast) and 44% (East Coast). Areal variations in CG flashes reveal that audibility of thunder is better in the cooler northern latitudes, poorer in the mountains, and good on the West Coast. Regional values allow estimation of the average thunderstorm frequency and durations of point storm activity. Peak single-storm CG flashes vary from 50 at West Coast stations to greater than 2000 flashes in the Northeast and Florida, being between 2 (West) and 15 (East) times the point averages. The results allow for assessment of the risks associated with CG lightning throughout the United States. Findings also reveal that the use of historical thunder data, as a surrogate for lightning activity, is improper, and thunder values need to be adjusted with the relationships presented. A future shift to making thunderstorm observations using lightning data, as opposed to the thunder-heard method of the past and present, will bring sizable differences in the incidence and duration of storm activity, with increases ranging from 10% to 50% depending on the area of the United States.																			0894-8763					JAN	1993	32	1					88	105		10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0088:RBTACT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0088:RBTACT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993KG48800007
J	Ertunç, A				Ertunç, A			The geological problems of the large dams constructed on the Euphrates River (Turkey)	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												In order to use the energy and irrigation potential of the Euphrates River, a series of dams have been designed (upstream to downstream); Keban, Karakaya, Karababa (Ataturk), Birecik and Karkamis. The first three of these dams have been completed; construction on the Birecik and Karkamis dams is underway. The initial plans involved a 60 m high Golkoy dam, downstream of the Karakaya dam, with the Ataturk dam 60 m lower than it is currently. In the belief that the cost of irrigation by the Ataturk dam's water would be high, the increase of the height of Ataturk dam was preferred to the construction of the Golkoy dam. The Keban dam's basement is formed by karstic rock, named Keban marble. From the author and his colleagues' studies, it has been shown that water would leak from the left side of Keban dam reservoir, forming a spring in the Keban Creek. In order to prevent this water leakage, an intensive grouting programme was applied. In spite of this, when the reservoir was filled, 26-30 m(3)/s of water leaked from the Keban Creek. A more recent study on the volume of leakage showed it to be reduced to 7-8 m(3)/s, with this amount remaining constant. The Karakaya dam is constructed on metamorphic rocks thus only allowing minimal water leakage. However, on the downstream side of the right slope, the Tillo-Bego-Senketo landslides have been an important risk to the dam. If such landslides cause an artifical lake by blocking the Euphrates River, the Karakaya hydroelectric power station could be flooded. Limestone forms the foundations for the Ataturk dam. On and around the damsite, there is epithermal water (24-26 degrees C) below the aquifer, deeper than 300 m, with the level of the grouting curtain down to 180-200 m. The grouting curtain would not be able to prevent the leakage because the level of karstification extends below the grouting curtain. In February 1993, the total volume of leaking water from the damsite and its vicinity reached 10 m(3)/s when the reservoir level was 517 m. When the reservoir is full (542 m), the volume of leaking water is expected to increase. Under the clay core of the dam, extending from the surface to 30-40 m depth, high grouting pressure could not be applied, so water leaked at this part of the grouting curtain and thus the amount of leaked water could not be measured.

J	Önal, M; Helvaci, C; Ceyhan, F				Önal, M; Helvaci, C; Ceyhan, F			Geology and trona potential of the middle Miocene Gurun (Sivas) Basin, central Anatolia, Turkey	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Gurun (Sivas) basin, extending along east-west direction,contains a volcano-sedimentary sequence of up to 1222 m thick. The middle Miocene sedimentary sequence rest with angular unconformity on the basement rocks, which consist of limestone and flysch sediments ranging in Triassic-Jurassic-Cretaceous and middle-upper Eocene. The sequence has been subdivided into Gurun Formation and Karada (g) over tilde Volcanics. The Gurun Formation consist of four members in ascending order: Kavak, Gokpinar, Cayboyu and Terzioglu members. Trona occurences are placed within the Terzioglu member, alternating with bituminous shale, mudstones and tuffs; whereas the lignite deposits occured in the Cayboyu member of the Gurun Formation. The Miocene sedimentary rock units are laterally and vertically gradational. Karada (g) over tilde Volcanics, located in the eastern and northern parts of basin, interfinger with the upper parts of the Terzioglu member, and also cut the whole rock units. The thickness of the sequence increases towards the northern and eastern sides where the basin was faulted. According to spor and pollen fossils, the age of sedimentary rock units is middle Miocene. The rock units were deposited in alluvial, fluvial, lacustrine and playa-lake environments. The middle Miocene sedimentary sequence, which were deposited under the control of a tectonic regime. In the region, gravity tectonic, which is characterized by the growth faults, began to developed in the beginning of middle Miocene. The growth faults, which were developed at the northern margin of the basin, controlled the deposition during the middle Miocene. Gurun basin was affected by the extensional tectonic regime changed to a compressional regime during the late Miocene time. During this new tectonic phase, NE, SW compressional regime occuring in the region probably originated from the movement of the East Anatolian Fault. The bituminous shales of the Terzioglu member contains starkeite, hexzahydrite, dolomite and calcite. Na-carbonate (trona) leachings are rather common within the lower and middle parts of the Terzioglu member. Sodium carbonate minerals occuring in the basin are nahcolite, pirssonite, gaylusite and shortite. The beds consisting of the Na-carbonate minerals grade into mudstones and clayey limestones towards the edges of the basin. The Gurun middle Miocene basin is mainly filled by clastics and products of adjacent volcanic activity which was centered at the east and north of basin. The most likely sources of sodium for the formation of Na-carbonate (trona) accurences are thermal springs, tuff interbedded with the sediments, and extensive the middle Miocene volcanic rocks interfingering with the sedimentary rocks in the eastern and northern parts of the basin.																			0891-2556	1878-5212				DEC	2004	19	2					118	132		10.1007/BF03178475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03178475													WOS:000225387700004
J	Delmelle, P; Bernard, A				Delmelle, P; Bernard, A			Downstream composition changes of acidic volcanic waters discharged into the Banyupahit stream, Ijen caldera, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The crater lake of Kawah Ijen volcano contains extremely low pH (<0.4) waters with high SO4 (similar to 70000 mg/kg), Cl (similar to 21000 mg/kg), F (similar to 1500 mg/kg), Al (similar to 5000 mg/kg), Fe (similar to 2000 mg/kg) and trace metal (Cu similar to 0.5, Zn similar to 4, Pb similar to 3 mg/kg) contents. These brines seep outward through the western crater rim and reappear on the other side as streamlets, which form the headwaters of the Banyupahit stream. The Banyupahit first mixes with fresh rivers and thermal springs in the Ijen caldera and then irrigates a coastal agricultural plain which is 30 km from the summit crater. We discuss the downstream composition changes affecting the Banyupahit waters by using stable isotope, chemical and mineralogical data collected from sites along the stream length. The saturation of the stream waters with respect to minerals was evaluated with SOLVEQ and WATEQ4F and compared with the geochemical observations. An aluminous mineralogy (alunogen, pickeringite, tamarugite and kalinite) develops in the upper part of the Banyupahit due to concentration of the headwaters by evaporation. Downstream attenuation of dissolved element concentrations results principally from dilution and from mineral precipitation. The stream pH changes from similar to 0 at the source to >4 close to the mouth. The delta D and delta(18)O values and the relative SO4-Cl-F contents of the Banyupahit waters indicate that the tributaries are mostly meteoric. Dissolved SO4 in the acidic stream come only from the crater lake seepages and are not involved later in microbially mediated reactions, as shown by their delta(34)S and delta(18)O values. Re-equilibration of the stream SO4 oxygen-isotope composition with H2O from tributaries does not occur. Calcium, SiO2, Al, Fe, K and SO4 behave non-conservatively in the stream waters. Gypsum, silica (amorphous or poorly ordered), a basic aluminum hydroxysulfate (basaluminite?), K-jarosite and amorphous ferric hydroxide may exert a solubility control on these elements along the entire stream length, or in certain stream sections, consistent with the thermochemical model results. Downstream concentration trends and mineral saturation levels suggest that precipitation of Sr-, Pb-rich barite and celestite consume Ba, Sr and Ph, whereas dissolved Cu, Pb and Zn may adsorb onto solid particles, especially after the junctions of the acidic stream with non-acidic rivers. We calculated that significant fluxes of SO4, F, Cl, Al, SiO2, Ti, Mn and Cu may reach the irrigation system, possibly causing serious environmental impacts such as soil acidification and induration.

J	Berthold, P				Berthold, P			Changes in the breeding bird fauna of two southern German rural communities during recent decades - lost paradises?	JOURNAL FUR ORNITHOLOGIE												In the regions associated with two rural communities (Moggingen - site of the Vogelwarte Radolfzell - and Billafingen - the author's residence, both near Lake Constance) the changes in the local avifauna have been followed for 5 and 3 decades respectively, by means of continuous observation, repeated population assessments, diary notes etc., for Moggingen also in quantitative detail. The results, summarized in Tables I and 2, are based on extensive species descriptions with source citations, which are available at http://www.do-g.de/journals or from the author. In selected study areas around Moggingen (ca. 4 km(2)) in the course of 50 years 110 species of breeding birds have been detected, and around Billafingen (ca. 8 km(2)) in 30 years 84 species; of these, 89 and 74 respectively have been (almost) regular breeders. Changes over the study period are measurable: of the (almost) regularly breeding species 18 (21 %) and 14 (19 %) have disappeared, while 12 (14 %) and 5 (7 %) now breed irregularly or hardly at all. Of the 56 regularly breeding species that remain near Moggingen, the populations of 20 have clearly declined, 32 are stable, only 4 have increased; the values for Billafingen are 7 out of 51 declined, 41 stable and 3 increased. Only 8 and 3 new species respectively are now (at least for the time being) breeding there. For the Moggingen study area it can be shown that the overall number of individuals has also shrunk considerably - from the original ca. 3300 to the present 2100 - and with it the total bird biomass - formerly ca. 240 kg, now 150 kg. This enormous and continuing loss of species diversity and individuals is attributable substantially to three factor complexes, which are discussed in detail: (i) destruction of habitats and deterioration of habitat quality, especially food supply, (ii) disturbances in the landscape and (iii) global climate warming. To arrest this deterioration towards an,increasingly Silent Spring" if possible, eight specific countermeasures are proposed: (i) political lobbying by organisations and the public, (ii) mobilisation of scientists, (iii) reorientation of basic research, (iv) enlisting the media, (v) more objective evaluation of successes, failures and influential parameters, (vi) up-to-date measures for protecting particular areas, (vii) establishment of a Management Group and (viii) intensification of conservation-oriented education.																			0021-8375					OCT	2003	144	4					385	410		10.1007/BF02465503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02465503													WOS:000187278600001
J	Dellapenna, TM; Kuehl, SA; Schaffner, LC				Dellapenna, TM; Kuehl, SA; Schaffner, LC			Ephemeral deposition, seabed mixing and fine-scale strata formation in the York River estuary, Chesapeake Bay	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A process-oriented sedimentary facies model is developed for the York River estuary, a sub-estuary of the lower Chesapeake Bay. This facies model was based on Pb-210 and grain-size profiles, as well as X-radiographs taken from kasten cores and box cores collected in a series of across-river transects. Throughout most of the energetic microtidal York River, the seabed is characterized by physical mixing to depths of 25-200 cm. A strong cross-estuary gradient in processes is observed with one side, including channel, flank and shoal, dominated by frequent deep erosion and redeposition (physical mixing), while physical mixing is reduced on the other side, resulting in a greater preservation of biological mixing signatures. Within the physically dominated side of the river, the mixed layer is characterized by 'stair-stepped' Pb-210 profiles with one or more segments (similar to25-200 cm thick) of nearly uniform excess activity. X-radiographs reveal that, although a record of limited biogenic sediment modification is preserved, sedimentary structures within the mixed layer are dominated by centimeter to decimeter scale units of finely to coarsely laminated strata bounded by hiatal surfaces. This demonstrates that mixing results primarily from erosion, resuspension and deposition. Reduced salinity limits the number of benthic species in the York River. Physical disturbance leads to an impoverishment of this community, which is composed primarily of small, opportunistic species with a paucity of larger macrofauna. As a result, mixing in the biologically dominated side of the river is generally on the order of a few centimeters, but may be as deep as 40 cm, and Pb-210 geochronology yields low biodiffusion rates (0.43-3.35 cm(2) yr(-1)). X-radiographs reveal the presence of some laminations which suggest that although the mixing is controlled by biological processes the mixing intensity is relatively low. Based on Pb-210 geochronologies, residence time estimates for particles within the mixed layer are on the order of centuries. Residence time calculations based on the sediment mass in the physically mixed layer is equivalent to 70 yr of river sediment yield, consistent with century-scale residence times from core data. The frequency and intensity of seabed mixing appears to differ between the lower and upper river. The lower York River is wider and deeper, and is more susceptible to large storms and sea surges, which we suspect drives much of the recorded seabed mixing. Within the upper river, longer-term events (storms) may cause the deepest mixing, but much of this record is destroyed by shorter-term, high-frequency events which produce shallow to mid-depth (<50 cm) mixing, probably driven by spring/neap tides, co-phased tidal constituents, and river flooding.

J	Williams, MW; Davinroy, T; Brooks, PD				Williams, MW; Davinroy, T; Brooks, PD			Organic and inorganic nitrogen pools in talus fields and subtalus water, Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					1996 Meeting of the Hydrological-Section of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union	1996	BANFF, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect				Organic and inorganic pools of nitrogen (N) were measured in talus fines or 'soils' and subtalus water during the summer of 1995 in the alpine Green Lakes Valley catchment of the Colorado Front Range. Nineteen talus soil samples were divided into four classes: subtalus dry, subtalus wet, surface vegetated and surface bare. The size of the individual talus soil patches ranged from 0.5 to 12.0 m(2) in area, with bulk density ranging from 0.98 to 1.71 kg m(-3) and soil texture ranging from sandy gravel in the subsurface talus to a loam in the vegetated surface. All samples contained KCl-extractable NH4+ and NO3- organic N and carbon (C), and 17 of 19 samples contained microbial biomass. The mean subtalus values for KCl-extractable NH4- of 3.2 mg N kg(-1), and NO3- of 1.0 mg N kg(-1), were comparable with developed alpine soils on Niwot Ridge. Average microbial biomass in subtalus soils of 5.4 mg N kg(-1) and total N of 1000 mg N kg(-1) were about an order of magnitude lower than alpine tundra soils, reflecting the reduced amount of vegetation in talus areas. However, these measurements in surface-vegetated patches of talus were comparable with the well-developed soils on Niwot Ridge. These measurements in talus of microbial biomass, total N and KC1-extractable NH4+ and NO3- show that there is sufficient biotically conditioned 'soil' within talus fields to influence the solute content of interstitial waters. Mean NO3- concentrations of 20 mu eq 1(-1) from 29 samples of subtalus water were significantly higher than the 6.7 mu eq 1(-1) in snow, while NH4+ concentrations in subtalus water of 0.7 mu eq 1(-1) was significantly lower than in snow at 5.2 mu eq 1(-1) (p = 0.001). Nitrate concentrations in subtalus water were significantly (p < 0.0001) correlated with concentrations of geochemical weathering products such as Ca2+ (r(2) = 0.84) and silica (r(2) = 0.49). The correlation of NO3- in subtalus water with geochemical weathering products suggests that NO3- concentrations in subtalus water increased with increased residence time, consistent with a biological source for this subtalus water NO3-. The high NO3- concentrations in subtalus water compared with atmospheric deposition of NO3-; suggests that No-3(-) in talus fields may contribute to NO3- in stream waters of high-elevation catchments.

SUBREGIONAL COMPARISON FOR FOREST-TO-PRODUCT BIOMASS SUPPLY CHAINS ON THE PACIFIC WEST COAST, USA	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Transportable biomass conversion facilities producing biochar, briquettes, and torrefied wood are modeled and optimized for five different sub-regions within the Pacific Northwest. Subregional case studies in Quincy, California; Lakeview, Oregon; Oakridge, Oregon; Port Angeles, Washington; and Warm Springs, Oregon, are evaluated to characterize the potential economic viability of these novel transportable designs. A mixed integer program is used to characterize the supply chain from residue extraction to market optimizing transportation, production, and plant mobility in order to minimize the supply chain costs. Regional variations including log specifications, energy rates, trucking, and logistic capacities are considered within the model and supporting analyses to differentiate regional costs and market viabilities. It was found that the optimal transportable design included facility movement on a 1 to 2.5 year frequency depending on product and region with biochar being the most likely to be economically viable. Regional feedstock composition and availability was the biggest indicator of lower cost production. Supply chain costs varied by 5%-10% depending on product and region being produced. Transportation and mobilization were found to account for 15%-30% of the overall supply chain cost. Quincy, California, and torrefied wood were found to have the lowest of these costs due to low move frequency and high wood availability while Port Angeles, Washington, with briquettes was the highest. With regards to fuel price sensitivity, torrefied wood was the most sensitive as its conversion process was most energy intensive (+/- 12%-13%) and biochar least sensitive (+/- 3-5%). Transportation accounted for 5% to 30% of the fuel price variation due to diesel prices depending on product and region. When including grid-connectivity, cost reductions were approximately 6%-7% for biochar, 27%-29% for briquettes and 33%-38% for torrefied wood. These findings indicate biochar as the most likely candidate for a transportable conversion system given its relatively low power consumption, high allowable moisture content, and low product transportation cost. Quincy, California, was found to be the most desirable sub region with the lowest overall production costs attributed to its high input quality feedstock and relative accessibility; its higher grid-connected power cost also makes transportable options relatively more attractive than other off-grid locations. Port Angeles, WA had the highest production costs and lowest grid-energy costs. Our results indicate that a rise in diesel price, while incentivizing transportable conversion facilities due to more cost effective transportation, would be more than offset by the higher cost energy consumption during the conversion process when compared with grid-power with the potential exception of biochar. Overall, we see a transportable operation with grid-power would likely be the difference between an economically viable supply chain and one that is not.																			0883-8542	1943-7838					2018	34	1					157	174		10.13031/aea.12526	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.12526													WOS:000425170100014
J	Zerquera, JT; Mora, JC; Robles, B				Zerquera, Juan Tomas; Mora, Juan C.; Robles, Beatriz			Probabilistic Prognosis of Environmental Radioactivity Concentrations due to Radioisotopes Discharged to Water Bodies from Nuclear Power Plants	TOXICS												Due to their very low values, the complexity of comparing the contribution of nuclear power plants (NPPs) to environmental radioactivity with modeled values is recognized. In order to compare probabilistic prognosis of radioactivity concentrations with environmental measurement values, an exercise was performed using public data of radioactive routine discharges from three representative Spanish nuclear power plants. Specifically, data on liquid discharges from three Spanish NPPs: Almaraz, Vandellos II, and Asco to three different aquatic bodies (river, lake, and coast) were used. Results modelled using generic conservative models together with Monte Carlo techniques used for uncertainties propagation were compared with values of radioactivity concentrations in the environment measured in the surroundings of these NPPs. Probability distribution functions were inferred for the source term, used as an input to the model to estimate the radioactivity concentrations in the environment due to discharges to the water bodies. Radioactivity concentrations measured in bottom sediments were used in the exercise due to their accumulation properties. Of all the radioisotopes measured in the environmental monitoring programs around the NPPs, only Cs-137, Sr-90, and Co-60 had positive values greater than their respective detection limits. Of those, Sr-90 and Cs-137 are easily measured in the environment, but significant contribution from the radioactive fall-out due to nuclear explosions in the atmosphere exists, and therefore their values cannot be attributed to the NPPs. On the contrary, Co-60 is especially useful as an indicator of the radioactive discharges from NPPs because its presence in the environment can solely be attributed to the impact of the closer nuclear facilities. All the modelled values for Co-60 showed a reasonable correspondence with measured environmental data in all cases, being conservative in two of them. The more conservative predictions obtained with the models were the activity concentrations in the sediments of a lake (Almaraz) where, on average, values two times higher were obtained. For the case of rivers (Asco), calculated results were adequately conservative-up to 3.4 times on average. However, the results for coasts (Vandellos II) were in the same range as the environmental measurements, obtaining predictions that are only-at maximum-1.1 times higher than measured values. Only for this specific case of coasts could it be established that the models are not conservative enough, although the results, on average, are relatively close to the real values.

J	Elser, JJ; Chrzanowski, TH; Sterner, RW; Mills, KH				Elser, JJ; Chrzanowski, TH; Sterner, RW; Mills, KH			Stoichiometric constraints on food-web dynamics: A whole-lake experiment on the Canadian shield	ECOSYSTEMS												A whole-lake manipulation of food-web structure (introduction of a top predator, northern pike, to a minnow-dominated lake) was performed in a Canadian Shield lake (L110) to examine the stoichiometric consequences of changes in planktonic community structure generated by altered food-web structure. Minnow abundance, zooplankton biomass and community composition, microconsumer abundance, and concentration and carbon-phosphorus (C:P) ratio of suspended particulate matter were monitored in L110 and unmanipulated L240 before (1992) and after (1993-95) pike introduction. Algal biomass in L110 determined from microscopic examination for postmanipulation and premanipulation periods was also compared with dynamics in a suite of unmanipulated reference lakes from longterm monitoring records. Pike were added in spring in 1993 and 1994 in sufficient quantity to raise pike biomass to levels of around 22 kg ha(-1) by 1994. Minnow populations in L110 responded dramatically, decreasing to levels 30% (1993), 10% (1994), and less than 1% (1995) of premanipulation values. However, most components lower in the food web did not respond in a manner consistent with predictions of existing food-web theory, such as the idea of cascading trophic interactions (CTI). While Daphnia biomass increased in L110 in the first year following manipulation, consistent with CTI, this effect was temporary and Daphnia collapsed in 1995, the year of lowest minnow abundance. Total zooplankton biomass in both lakes declined during the study period and, contrary to CTI, this decline appeared somewhat stronger in L110 than in L240. Dominant microconsumers (heterotrophic microflagellates) did not differ among years in either lake and did not appear to respond to food-web manipulation. At the bottom of the food web, no changes in bacterial biomass occurred in either lake. However, total concentrations of particulate matter appeared to increase in L110 after manipulation (contrary to expectations based on the theory of CTI) while algal biomass did not change in the manipulated lake relative to reference systems. Finally, particulate C:P increased in both L110 and L240 during the study period. The lack of strong response of Daphnia, the lack of response of the microbial food web, decreases in zooplankton biomass and increases in particulate biomass following reduction of minnow populations after piscivore introduction are at odds with expectations from existing food-web theory, such as the idea of CTI as currently formulated. However, the extremely high C:P ratios in particulate matter at the base of the food webs in these lakes, the coincidence of zooplankton declines and increases in particulate C:P ratios, and the results of small-scale mesocosm food-quality experiments are consistent with a hypothesis of a stoichiometric constraint operating on food-web dynamics in this and similar ecosystems.

J	DAVIS, DW; SCHANDL, ES; WASTENEYS, HA				DAVIS, DW; SCHANDL, ES; WASTENEYS, HA			U-PB DATING OF MINERALS IN ALTERATION HALOS OF SUPERIOR PROVINCE MASSIVE SULFIDE DEPOSITS - SYNGENESIS VERSUS METAMORPHISM	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												U-Pb geochronology of igneous zircon from rhyolitic host rocks to the Archean Kidd Creek, Geco and Winston Lake massive sulfide deposits, in the Superior Province of Ontario, shows that volcanism, which accompanied mineralization, occupied a narrow time span (2717 +/- 2 Ma, 2720 +/- 2 Ma and 2723 +/- 2 Ma, respectively). Precise ages of hydrothermal monazite, allanite and rutile from alteration zones surrounding the above deposits indicate that these minerals crystallized 40-70 million years after volcanism. Monazite from Kidd Creek mine is 2659 +/- 3 Ma old, in agreement with spatially associated 2664 +/- 25 Ma old rutile. Monazite from a biotite schist at Geco mine gives a similar age of 2661 +/- 1 Ma. However, monazite from a sericite schist, which hosts the ore at Geco mine, is 2675 +/- 2 Ma old. Abraded large monazite grains from three units in the Winston Lake deposit are coeval with biotite crystallization and record an age of 2677 +/- 2 Ma, approximately the same as monazite in the sericite schist at Geco. Data points from allanite fractions from both the Winston Lake and Geco deposits fall on a Pb-Pb isochron that gives an age of 2672 +/- 5 Ma. Rutile from Winston Lake gives a younger age of 2651 + 6/-2 Ma and may date retrograde alteration of biotite to chlorite. The ca. 2676 Ma age of monazite from Winston Lake and in the sericite schist at Geco mine probably dates a regional metamorphic event that affected most of the southern Superior Province. The ca. 2660 Ma old monazite in the biotite schist at Geco mine and in the chlorite-sericite alteration at Kidd Creek may date later K-metasomatism caused by metamorphically derived fluids that were focussed along old fault structures. Such fluids were also responsible for local sulfide remobilization. Monazite and rutile are spatially associated with chlorite and sericite alterations at Kidd Creek. Their young ages indicate that these originally syngenetic mineral assemblages may have been significantly affected by regional metamorphism. Formation of monazite at all three deposits studied was a result of significant REE remobilization during metamorphism. The discrete character of syn-metamorphic hydrothermal activity in different units of the same deposit, as well as its synchroneity among different, widely separated deposits, requires a mechanism for episodic injection of heat and fluid into the crust on a regional scale. These activities are broadly coeval with, and probably related to, plutonism within adjacent metasedimentary subprovinces and middle to lower crustal metamorphism in the Superior Province.																			0010-7999					FEB	1994	115	4					427	437		10.1007/BF00320976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00320976													WOS:A1994MZ04600005
J	Maiste, M				Maiste, Margus			In the Intermission between Two Fronts. On the Registration of and Developments in the Estonian Population in 1942 and 1943	TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI												Although a great deal has been written from the political angle about the Estonian population at the time of World War II, the fact that the Estonian population in the war years has been considered very little from the demographic aspect sums up this article. Statistical activity was quite intensive in the period under consideration. The overall director here was the Estonian Statistics Administration, which operated as part of the Estonian Self-Administration. From the standpoint of calculating the population, the most important event in that period was undoubtedly the registration of the population on 1 February 1943. Most likely, this was admittedly largely connected to the taxation of the population, yet from the standpoint of calculating the population, two criteria were of the greatest importance here: the comprehensiveness of the registration, and the existence of the registration's critical moment. The programme of the questions was minimal, allowing the population's gender, age, and family and household composition to be determined in addition to the size of the population, along with information on occupations and job positions. In addition to this, several other data collection undertakings connected to calculating the population took place as well from 1942 to the summer of 1944: a study of rural municipalities in 1942, the registration of persons with German citizenship in the spring of 1943, the assembly of data on the Estonian population according to occupation (particularly in regard to industrial workers), and an agricultural census and the calculation of the number of people working in agriculture in June of 1944. To a great extent, data founded on the registration of the Estonian population on 1 December 1941 was the source for these calculations. The data that had been collected was disclosed officially in the Estonian General Commissariat's statistical publications, which from the very start had been meant exclusively for official use. In using these publications, it has to be taken into consideration that the sources of data for different tables, hence the bases of data, are different. This means that different tables do not necessarily fit together with one another. The composition of published data is similarly very limited. Hence, official publications did not publish data on age structures, occupations, nationalities, confessions of faith, and households. Nevertheless, it is possible to highlight numerous key developments in the Estonian population in 1942-1943 on the basis of this data. Not only changes in the size of the population and in its gender composition, but also the natural and mechanical movement of the population, and to a certain extent the distribution of the population according to occupations, can be observed on the basis of the published tables. The size of Estonia's population in that period can be presented at two instances in time: January of 1942 (1,005,527 people) and 1 February 1943 (1,015,923 people, including 444,624 men and 571,299 women). The fact is that Estonia's civilian population did not decrease in those years, but rather either remained stable or even grew somewhat. The large predominance of women over men stood out in particular in the Estonian population's gender composition. Neither the wartime growth of the population, nor even its stability, can be explained by natural increase in the population, since negative population growth characterised Estonia's population over the entire wartime period. Even so, population growth fluctuated significantly month to month. Hence the natural increase in population was altogether positive from July to September in 1942 and from July to September in 1943. Thereat in assessing this data, it has to be taken into consideration that the official registration of events was not necessarily in step with the actual process. In 1941 when the war reached Estonia, a sharp increase took place in the birth and death rates, which abated by 1943. Migration abroad that was not connected to forced movements caused by the war (resettlement, mobilisation and other such factors) can be followed on the basis of published data for the latter half of 1942 and the first half of 1943. Thus in the case of people who entered the country and those who left the country, a boundary can be drawn through February and March of 1943. The number of people who arrived in Estonia dropped unexpectedly in February, whereas the number of people who left Estonia rose very quickly in March. On the whole, the increase in Estonia's foreign migration was positive until February of 1943, yet after that it turned negative. Estonia's wartime demographic picture was characteristically contradictory, simultaneously including developments characteristic of the pre-war era while being directly affected by the progress of the war. Or on the contrary - the effects of the war were visible, yet at the same time the overall tendency in population development continued, which can be traced back to the pre-war period. The effects of the war were manifested in Estonia primarily in mass emigration and immigration. A great deal has been written about the former, while less has been written about the latter. The evacuation of the non-Russian population from the area on the east side of Lake Peipus, including the resettlement of Estonians and Ingrians to Estonia, significantly affected the Estonian population in 1942-1943. This process in particular evidently affected the dynamics of the size of Estonia's population at that time, yet that is not all. In a demographic sense, that immigration is one part of a larger process that shaped the development of the Estonian population to a significant degree in the 20th century.																			1406-4030						2020		3					40	+																WOS:000618076900005

The study determined the concentrations of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd) in sediment and water samples collected from 12 stations covering the entire lake, as well as in the liver and muscle tissues of the three commercially edible fish species (African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus), Blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), and Redbelly tilapia (Tilapia zillii)), during winter 2019. Cartographic maps investigating the spatial contamination pattern of each metal in sediment and water samples along the entire lake, as well as correlation analysis between metal pairs, were generated. Moreover, the study examined the affinity of metal transfer among the three compartments and assessed the probability of being exposed to non-carcinogenic health hazards from the consumption of the abovementioned species. Results revealed that Fe and Cd recorded the highest and lowest mean concentrations, respectively, in sediment, water, and fish samples. The mean concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Ni in the water of Lake Edku, as well as the mean concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Cr in muscle tissues of the three examined fish species, exceeded the permissible limits. The northwestern part of the lake exhibited the highest concentrations of Fe, Ni, and Cr in Lake Edku's sediment with strong significant positive correlations recorded between Fe-Ni, Fe-Cr, and Ni-Cr pairs suggesting sharing the same contamination source. Concerning Lake Edku's water, the northwestern area displayed the highest concentrations for all metals. Moreover, Cd, Pb, and Cr exhibited nearly the same spatial contamination pattern with the hotspot located in the western part of the lake. Strong significant positive correlations were found between Cd-Pb, Cd-Cr, and Pb-Cr pairs in surface water, suggesting sharing the same origin of dispersion. The three fish species accumulated heavy metals from water several folds higher than from sediments, indicating that water is the main source of the intensive transfer of heavy metals to the three fish species. Based on the consumption of the three investigated fish species, children recorded the highest estimated daily (EDI) and weekly intakes (EWI) of heavy metals followed by adults. Regardless Pb, EWI values indicated that there are no significant health risks through fish consumption from the examined metals recommending that children should consume less than 85.227 g/day African sharptooth catfish muscle, 108.696 g/day Blue tilapia muscle, and 97.403 g/day Redbelly tilapia muscle to assure their health. Moreover, adults should consume less than 397.727 g/day African sharptooth catfish muscle, 507.24 g/day Blue tilapia muscle, and 454.54 g/day Redbelly tilapia muscle. The estimated hazard quotient (HQ) of all metals was lower than or close to the safe values of one for children and adults in the three investigated fish species indicating the absence of potential non-carcinogenic threats. The hazard index (HI) estimated for the five examined heavy metals in each of the investigated fish species was below one in adults only. Regarding the total hazard index estimated from consuming the three fish species, both children and adults may be subjected to non-carcinogenic risk.					; Emam, Wiame/AAC-8662-2021; Soliman, Kareem/ABG-4784-2020; Emam, Wiame W.M./AAC-8662-2021	Soliman, Kareem M./0000-0003-3229-7331; Emam, Wiame W.M./0000-0002-7803-2294													0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2021	28	16					20140	20156		10.1007/s11356-020-11661-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11661-8		JAN 2021						33410074					WOS:000605568500032
J	Wilson, H				Wilson, H			Legislative challenges for lake eutrophication control in Europe	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			There is no single piece of legislation which comprehensively addresses the problem of eutrophication of freshwater lakes. An examination is made of the extent to which national and EU laws applicable in England and Wales may be used to reduce phosphorus inputs to eutrophicated lakes. This case study is then used to outline the shortcomings of existing legislation and the future challenges for lake eutrophication control. Applicable legislation may be divided into that relating to nature conservation, to water quality and to agricultural extensification. Nature conservation laws are applicable, in that lakes designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), are theoretically safeguarded from degradation. The main limitation of the SSSI system lies in the boundary definition process under which, as a rule, no other category of legally protected land may be designated. Thus, the use of surrounding buffer land to protect water quality at the catchment level is generally precluded. The introduction of consultation areas around SSSIs of international importance under the EU Directive on Habitats is unlikely to alleviate the problem, since the area involved remains minimal compared to the extent of the majority of catchments. Intensive agricultural practices are responsible for significant nutrient enrichment of rivers and lakes, so that legislation aimed at extensification is also relevant. Examples of agricultural extensification include the Environrnentally Sensitive Areas programme and various options available for Set-Aside land. However, the prime purpose of such initiatives is the alleviation of surplus and budgetary problems and, as such, they fall short of a fully integrated approach to the ecological management of farmland. Nutrient enrichment is, essentially, a water quality issue, but policy and legislation in this area are not yet sufficiently developed to address the problem comprehensively. The current regulatory process for water quality carries the potential to work comparatively well for point sources under the system of consents to discharge. This potential is limited, however, by the paucity of information available on ecologically acceptable concentrations of phosphorus in discharges. In addition, the consents system is not constructed to deal effectively with diffuse agricultural losses of phosphorus, since, unlike point sources, these tend to arise from the cumulative effect of many activities. The main legislative challenge for lake eutrophication control lies in the area of diffuse agricultural losses of phosphorus. In this respect, experience in the U.S.A. reveals that the use of comprehensive and catchment-wide 'Best Management Practices' is capable of producing significant water quality improvements, providing that some degree of mandatory compliance is incorporated.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	1999	395						389	401		10.1023/A:1017007315753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017007315753													WOS:000082727900034
J	Carroll, J; Williamson, M; Lerche, I; Karabanov, E; Williams, DF				Carroll, J; Williamson, M; Lerche, I; Karabanov, E; Williams, DF			Geochronology of Lake Baikal from 210Pb and 137Cs radioisotopes	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES												Two box cores of near surface sediments were obtained from Lake Baikal in Southeastern Siberia, Russia. The cores were taken from the northern and southern basins of the lake during a joint American-Russian research expedition in the summer of 1994. The cores were analyzed for Pb-210, Cs-137 and total organic carbon (TOC). Organic carbon is an indicator of photosynthetic production by phytoplankton, taking place primarily in the euphotic zone of the water column. Accumulation rates of TOC may be used as indicators of paleo-productivity when sedimentation rates are determined using the Pb-210 dating method and combined with both the density of sediment and organic carbon content. Accordingly, the lake is characterized by changes in accumulations of TOC, which may be linked to rates of sedimentation. Accumulations of TOC and sedimentation rates were higher in the southern basin site than in the northern basin site. The southern station core was taken from an area in close proximity to the Selenga River delta, which carries 50% of the water input to Lake Baikal, Productivity should thus be higher in this region due to the high nutrient input and sediment accumulation higher due to influx of riverine sediment input. Traces of Cs-137 (anthropogenic product) were found in both cores. However, activities of Cs-137 were significantly higher in the southern basin, likely due to the input of the Selenga River in the southern region, which extends to a region in Mongolia in close proximity to the area of the Chinese atomic-bomb atmospheric testing of the 1970s. Application of a quantitative inverse model to the Pb-210 profiles yielded the following results. (i) station 12, near the Selenga Delta, had an accumulation rate of about 0.38 cm/y in 1957 but this rate was halved by 1980 to about 0.22 cm/y and has been roughly steady since that time; Cs-137 values are consistent with the age-to-depth determination from Pb-210 for station 12; (ii) since about 1960, station 5A in the northern basin had an accumulation rate lower by a factor 2-4 than that of the station near the Selenga Delta; the Cs-137 values are consistent with the Pb-210 age-to-depth determination for station 5A; (iii) the Cs-137 activities for station 12 systematically increase with time towards the present day and are about a factor 6-10 higher than Cs-137 activities recorded for station 5A, which do not show a corresponding systematic increase with time.

The main goal of the investigation was the assessment of the groundwater potential of the uppermost aquifer. The aquifer conditions such as depth, thickness and boundaries were also investigated. The obtained apparent resistivity curves were first analysed qualitatively and classified using simple curve shapes. Thereafter, the data were converted to resistivity and thickness pairs semi-quantitatively by means of master curves and then quantitatively by computer modelling using ATO and Winsev software (Zohdy, 1989; Zohdy and Bisdrof, 1989). Lithological control from the available single well with a stratigraphic log aided in the correlation of the resistivity values to different rock units. Three different AB-spacing iso-resistivity maps, an isopach map of the main groundwater-bearing horizon, the depth to the aquifer substratum map and five geoelectric cross-sections were constructed. The interpretation of these soundings indicates the presence of an unconfined to semi-confined sandy aquifer with relatively important extent and varying thickness. The maximal thickness of the aquifer is recorded in the central part of the investigated area and is thinning southwards to pinch out farther to the south. Geophysical as well as field data indicate a hydraulic connection between the upper and deeper aquifers. Indeed, the two aquifers are separated from each other by a marly substratum that is indicated throughout the area by the lowest values of the interpreted true resistivity. The value of this resistivity varies laterally, most likely due to the lateral variation in the shale-to-sand ratio. The altitude of the substratum decreases towards the north, and increases southwards. Regarding the availability of the groundwater in the study area, zones with high potential are theoretically expected to occur in the central part where the transversal resistance is greatest. However, sufficient water supply and high flow rates from wells intended to produce restrictively from the most upper aquifer are not likely to exist. This conclusion, which seems to be very pessimistic, is evidenced from two real field and experimental observations. The first is the rapid fall of the level of Gharnoug lake, despite the ongoing feeding by three wells. Hence, the amount of water level drop cannot be accounted for by the evaporation alone. That means that the deeper aquifer is continuously draining the upper aquifer at a high flow rate. Very low rates are recorded in all the wells that penetrated only the upper aquifer, the exception being the well that reached deeper into the lower aquifer. The flow rate in this lower aquifer measured 18 litre s(-1). Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

High-grade ore is confined to the Nabarlek fault, a reverse fault/shear zone that crosscuts a series of interbedded muscovite-quartz-biotite schists and amphibolite. Petrographic studies on polished thin sections combined with electron microprobe analyses, X-ray diffraction, fluid inclusion data, O-H and U-Pb isotope values, as well as 40Ar/39Ar dating have identified up to eight significant fluid events beginning with the precipitation of early quartz veins during uplift of the Myra Falls Metamorphics at 1830 Ma and ending with limited uraninite recrystallization during reactivation of the Nabarlek fault between 1380 and 750 Ma. Quartz veins that likely formed toward the end of the Top End orogeny represent the earliest recorded fluid event. Fluid inclusion data and delta(18)O and deltaD values indicate that these veins formed from basement-derived fluids that may have been heated by a cooling Nabarlek Granite during circulation through reverse faults/shear zones. The next fluid event, represented by fine-grained sericite and chlorite occurred when fluids passed into these faults and altered the metamorphic minerals following the exhumation of the basement and deposition of the Kombol-gie Subgroup at ca. 1760 Ma. The intrusion of the Oenpelli Dolerite at ca. 1720 Ma resulted in the local remobi-lization of silica and the precipitation of quartz associated with minor pyrite and dolomite around the reverse faults. Uranium mineralization is associated with an inner and outer alteration halo that extends as far as I km from the Nabarlek fault. Alteration in the outer halo began as early as 1700 Ma and is dominated by chlorite and sericite, which formed when a 200degreesC fluid flowed into the Nabarlek fault from the overlying Kombolgie Subgroup. U-Pb and Pb-207/Pb-206 dating reveals that massive uraninite precipitated at ca. 1640 Ma and formed together with illite and hematite at ca. 200degreesC. Chlorite was not coeval with uraninite precipitation. Stable isotope values indicate that the pre- and synore alteration assemblage formed from basinal brines with delta(18)O(fluid) and deltaD(fluid) values of 2 +/- 2 and -25 +/- 10 per mil, respectively. Reactivation of the Nabarlek fault at ca. 1360, 1100, and 900 Ma is indicated by U-Pb and Pb-207/Pb-206 dat-ing of uraninite. These ages correlate with the intrusion of the Maningkorrirr phonolitic dikes and the Derim Derim Dolerite at ca. 1316 +/- 40 and 1324 +/- 4 Ma, respectively, the amalgamation of Australia and Laurentia during the Grenville orogen at ca. 1140 Ma, and the breakup of Rodinia between 1000 and 750 Ma. Fluid incursions associated with these events precipitated much of the chlorite that has previously been related to uraninite precipitation. Drusy quartz veins that host high-salinity fluid inclusions and sulfides, particularly galena, also formed after the initial uraninite-forming event. Finally, erosion of the Kombolgie Subgroup and subsequent weathering of the deposit resulted in the recent formation of kaolinite and numerous secondary uranium minerals. These data constrain individual events more precisely than previous studies and thus advance the current genetic model to a level that takes into account the multiple stages of fluid overprinting that occurred over a period of at least 800 m.y. The Proterozoic Nabarlek unconformity-related uranium deposit in the Alligator Rivers uranium field is hosted by Paleoproterozoic amphibolite-grade, metamorphosed semipelitic sedimentary rocks and amphibo-lite schist. High-grade ore is confined to the Nabarlek fault, a reverse fault/shear zone that crosscuts a series of interbedded muscovite-quartz-biotite schists and amphibolite.

J	NAIMAN, RJ				NAIMAN, RJ			THE ANNUAL PATTERN AND SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF AQUATIC OXYGEN-METABOLISM IN BOREAL FOREST WATERSHEDS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												The level and diversity of metabolism in lotic ecosystems are largely functions of channel geomorphology and hydrology, making site-specific studies difficult to extrapolate to other parts of the watershed. This paper describes the pattern and distribution of aquatic O2 metabolism for undisturbed boreal forest watersheds in eastern Quebec, Canada. Metabolism by periphyton, mosses, macrophytes, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM: 0.5 .mu.m-1 mm), and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM: > 1 mm) was examined during the ice-free period (April-Nov.) of 1979 and 1980 in First Choice Creek (1st order; watershed area: 0.25 km2), Beaver Creek (2nd order; 1.83 km2), Muskrat River (5th order; 207 km2), Matamek River (6th order; 673 km2) and the Moisie River (9th order; 19,871 km2). As watershed area increases, primary production and the number of autotrophic groups are augmented with moss and macrophyte communities. Total O2 metabolism increases downstream, ranging from < 1 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 in First Choice Creek nearly 5 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 during summer in the Moisie River. Autotrophic metabolism is not normally correlated with light or chlorophyll, but annual O2 production is highly correlated with stream order (r2 > 0.76 in most cases). These data are combined with a geomorphological analysis of the watershed to discern the spatial distribution of aquatic metabolism, and to estimate total aquatic metabolism in the Moisie River drainage network. Mosses, occurring only in streams of fourth or higher order, are the most productive autotrophic component in the watershed (3.9 .times. 1010 g/yr); by comparison, periphyton produce only 2.1 .times. 1010 g/yr. FPOM is the most active detrital component (6.6 .times. 1010 g/yr). Geomorphic analyses show that streams of fourth or higher order comprise only 1.2% of the total number and 12.7% of the total length, but have 76.8% of the lotic surface area, and are responsible for 86.3% of the gross production by the entire lotic drainage network. The surface area of lakes is approximately 6 times that of streams, but their contibution (phytoplankton) to total aquatic ecosystem metabolism is comparable only to that of lotic periphyton. Results demonstrate that the River Continuum Concept can be extended to the watershed level by combining biological measurements with geomorphological analyses of the drainage network, thus allowing a detailed description of spatial and temporal patterns for specific metabolic components and total ecosystem metabolism to be constructed.

Qomolangma from 1974 to 2021	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Glacier melting in the Mt. Himalayas provides indispensable water resources for downstream inhabitants. Glacier mass balance (MB) studies have important implications for hazard management of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). However, Himalayan glacier MB results vary considerably among different studies with large uncertainties in satellite-based geodetic measurements, highlighting the necessity for further independent investigations and validation from multiple satellite platforms. Based on InSAR, photogrammetry, and laser altimetry techniques, we generate nine data sets of surface elevation differences (Dh) to study glacier geodetic MB in Rongbuk Catchment at the northern slope of Mt. Qomolangma. The data sets include five consecutive time periods over the last 48 years, i.e., 1974-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2015, and 2015-2021, and four overlapping periods of 1974-2012, 1974-2015, 2000-2015, and 1974-2021. The main results are summarized as follows. 1) Based on common reference DEM, Geodetic MB was -0.21 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 1974-2000, -0.22 & PLUSMN; 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) in 1974-2015, and -0.20 & PLUSMN; 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) in 1974-2021. Geodetic MB presented negative twice since 2000 as measured by ordinary, consecutive short-term analysis, which was -0.41 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 2000-2006, -0.50 & PLUSMN; 0.54 m w.e.a(-1) in 2006-2012, and -0.45 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 2015-2021. 2) Data validation by in-situ stake-observations at 5350, 5450, and 5500 m a.s.l in 1959-1960 and the 2000s, our results demonstrated convincing altitude effects on glacier change. Between 5150 m a.s.l. and 5800 m a.s.l., Dh presented a more downwasting rate with increasing altitude. While above 5800 m a.s.l., Dh became less negative with increasing altitude, and glaciers presented thickening trend above 6200 m a.s.l. 3) With the difference of Dh by 10 m altitude intervals (DDh), we located a sharp surface lowering zone on the debris-covered glacier tongue at 5240 & PLUSMN; 20 m in the 1970s. We postulated that it could be the glacier terminus under debris cover, which moved upward by 190 & PLUSMN; 20 m in the past five decades. With DDh, we also defined the turning point altitude at 5800 m & PLUSMN; 20 m, where Dh began to increase to be less negative with altitude. Moreover, summer temperature change and the number of melting days clearly explained the Dh change with altitude. 4) Glacier contribution to runoff was estimated by 30 & PLUSMN; 16 % from 1974 to 2021, however, our data also showed that approximately 70 % of runoff was from melting glaciers in 2015-2021, implying an amplifying effect of recent global warming on glacier contrubutions. In summary, our findings proved that DDh was an effective indicator for exploring mountain glacier change. The varying results revealed here indicates that more studies would be helpful to define and predict glacier, climatic and hydrological changes in the Mt. Himalayas with multiple techniques and observations based on a common reference over long term.

Climate and ecology in the Rocky Mountain interior after the early Eocene Climatic Optimum	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperatures increase with modern climate change, ancient hothouse periods become a focal point for understanding ecosystem function under similar conditions. The early Eocene exhibited high temperatures, high CO2 levels, and similar tectonic plate configuration as today, so it has been invoked as an analog to modern climate change. During the early Eocene, the greater Green River Basin (GGRB) of southwestern Wyoming was covered by an ancient hypersaline lake (Lake Gosiute; Green River Formation) and associated fluvial and floodplain systems (Wasatch and Bridger formations). The volcaniclastic Bridger Formation was deposited by an inland delta that drained from the northwest into freshwater Lake Gosiute and is known for its vast paleontological assemblages. Using this well-preserved basin deposited during a period of tectonic and paleoclimatic interest, we employ multiple proxies to study trends in provenance, parent material, weathering, and climate throughout 1 million years. The Blue Rim escarpment exposes approximately 100 m of the lower Bridger Formation, which includes plant and mammal fossils, solitary paleosol profiles, and organic remains suitable for geochemical analyses, as well as ash beds and volcaniclastic sandstone beds suitable for radioisotopic dating. New 40Ar / 39Ar ages from the middle and top of the Blue Rim escarpment constrain the age of its strata to similar to 49.5-48.5 Myr ago during the "falling limb" of the early Eocene Climatic Optimum. We used several geochemical tools to study provenance and parent material in both the paleosols and the associated sediments and found no change in sediment input source despite significant variation in sedimentary facies and organic carbon burial. We also reconstructed environmental conditions, including temperature, precipitation (both from paleosols), and the isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 from plants found in the floral assemblages. Results from paleosol-based reconstructions were compared to semi-co-temporal reconstructions made using leaf physiognomic techniques and marine proxies. The paleosol-based reconstructions (near the base of the section) of precipitation (608-1167 mm yr(-1)) and temperature (10.4 to 12.0 degrees C) were within error of, although lower than, those based on floral assemblages, which were stratigraphically higher in the section and represented a highly preserved event later in time. Geochemistry and detrital feldspar geochronology indicate a consistent provenance for Blue Rim sediments, sourcing predominantly from the Idaho paleoriver, which drained the active Challis volcanic field. Thus, because there was neither significant climatic change nor significant provenance change, variation in sedimentary facies and organic carbon burial likely reflected localized geomorphic controls and the relative height of the water table. The ecosystem can be characterized as a wet, subtropical-like forest (i.e., paratropical) throughout the interval based upon the floral humidity province and Holdridge life zone schemes. Given the mid-paleolatitude position of the Blue Rim escarpment, those results are consistent with marine proxies that indicate that globally warm climatic conditions continued beyond the peak warm conditions of the early Eocene Climatic Optimum. The reconstructed atmospheric delta C-13 value (-5.3 parts per thousand to -5.8 parts per thousand) closely matches the independently reconstructed value from marine microfossils (-5.

Sedimentary record of glacial Lake Missoula along the Clark Fork River from deep to shallow positions in the former lakes: St. Regis to near Drummond, Montana	EXPLORING THE NORTHERN ROCKY MOUNTAINS	Geological Society of America Field Guide											Glacial Lake Missoula was repeatedly dammed by the Purcell Trench Lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the last glaciation to maximum altitudes near 4200 ft (1280 m). Studies from outside of the lake basin suggest that the lake filled and drained multiple times in the late Pleistocene. Deposits and landforms within the former glacial lake basin provide evidence for a complex lake-level history that is not well understood for this famous impoundment. At least two general lake phases are evident in the stratigraphy: an earlier phase of catastrophic drainage that was responsible for large-scale dramatic erosional and depositional features, and a later, less-catastrophic, phase responsible for the preservation of fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments. Features of the earlier lake phase include giant gravel dunes and openwork gravel with anomalously large clasts (erratics). Deposits from the later phase are mostly low-energy glaciolacustrine sediments that record a history of lake-bottom sedimentation and repeated lake-floor exposure. A focus of this field trip is to look at evidence for the two lake phases as well as evaluate the record of exposure surfaces, and therefore lake-level lowerings, during the second phase at multiple locations in the lake basin. One of the second phase sites is close to a highstand, full basin position in the lake (near Garden Gulch), representing a maximum water depth at this site of similar to 100 m, whereas others (Rail line and Ninemile) are at lower altitudes in regions that may have been under as much as 300 m of water. Fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments are rippled very fine sandy silt and fining-upward sequences of laminated silt and clayey silt of glaciolacustrine origin. Periglacial features, contorted bedding, desiccation, and paleosols in outcrop provide clear evidence of multiple exposure surfaces; each represent a lake-lowering event.Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL or "optical dating") ages on quartz from the three sections (Ninemile, Rail line, and Garden Gulch) allow for preliminary correlations that suggest approximately the same phase of glacial Lake Missoula sedimentation. The exposure surfaces suggest that the glacial-lake level rose and fell at least 8-12 times to elevations above and below the sections (936-1180 m), filling to within 100 m of full pool (1280 m). Optical dating shows that this occurred after 20 ka and the last inundation of the lake before 13.5 ka. Correlation of specific exposure surfaces throughout the basin will be required to develop a lake-level history.																			2333-0937		978-0-8137-0037-3				2014	37						51	63		10.1130/2014.0037(02)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.0037(02)	10.1130/9780813700373												WOS:000340463900003
J	Ross, PS; White, JDL; McClintock, M				Ross, Pierre-Simon; White, James D. L.; McClintock, Murray			Geological evolution of the Coombs-Allan Hills area, Ferrar large igneous province, Antarctica: Debris avalanches, mafic pyroclastic density currents, phreatocauldrons	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The Jurassic Ferrar large igneous province of Antarctica comprises igneous intrusions, flood lavas, and mafic volcaniclastic deposits (now lithified). The latter rocks are particularly diverse and well-exposed in the Coombs-Allan Hills area of South Victoria Land, where they are assigned to the Mawson Formation. In this paper we use these rocks in conjunction with the pre-Ferrar sedimentary rocks (Beacon Supergroup) and the lavas themselves (Kirkpatrick Basalt) to reconstruct the geomorphological and geological evolution of the landscape. In the Early Jurassic, the surface of the region was an alluvial plain, with perhaps 1 km of mostly continental siliciclastic sediments underlying it. After the fall of silicic ash from an unknown but probably distal source, mafic magmatism of the Ferrar province began. The oldest record of this event at Allan Hills is a <= 180 m-thick debris-avalanche deposit (member m(1) of the Mawson Formation) which contains globular domains of mafic igneous rock. These domains are inferred to represent dismembered Ferrar intrusions emplaced in the source area of the debris avalanche; shallow emplacement of Ferrar magmas caused a slope failure that mobilized the uppermost Beacon Supergroup, and the silicic ash deposits, into a pre-existing valley or basin. The period which followed ('Mawson time') was the main stage for explosive eruptions in the Ferrar province, and several cubic kilometres of both new magma and sedimentary rock were fragmented over many years. Phreatomagmatic explosions were the dominant fragmentation mechanism, with magma-water interaction taking place in both sedimentary aquifers and existing vents filled by volcaniclastic debris. At Coombs Hills, a vent complex or 'phreatocauldron' was formed by coalescence of diatreme-like structures; at Allan Hills, member m(2) of the Mawson Formation consists mostly of thick, coarse-grained, poorly sorted layers inferred to represent the lithified deposits of pyroclastic density currents. Meanwhile at Carapace Nunatak, mafic clasts were mixed with detrital material to form the Carapace Sandstone in alluvial and eventually lacustrine environments. Eruptions then became largely effusive, producing hundreds of metres of flood lavas that covered the landscape ('Kirkpatrick time'). In places, lava flowed into ephemeral lakes to form pillow-palagonite breccias (base of sequence, Carapace Nunatak) or pillow lavas (top of sequence, Coombs Hills). Several generations of Ferrar intrusions were emplaced during the course of these events; at least three can be distinguished based on field relations. New geochemical data indicates that for the Ferrar province, magma involved in the explosive eruptions had the same major element composition as that which produced shallow intrusions and lavas. We also note the possibility that flood lavas were fed by plugs crosscutting the Mawson Formation at Coombs Hills, rather than by major dikes extending to the surface. Finally, we infer that eruption plumes were limited to the troposphere and that direct environmental impacts were thus likely restricted to the southern hemisphere. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

C	Levay, G; Schumann, R			Australasian Inst Mining & Metallurgy	Levay, G.; Schumann, R.			A systematic approach to water quality management in the minerals processing industry	WATER IN MINING 2006, PROCEEDINGS: MULTIPLE VALUES OF WATER	Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Publication Series				2nd AusIMM Water in Mining Conference	NOV 14-16, 2006	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Sinclair Knight Merz, Queensland Govt, RIO TINTO				Mining companies often view water quality as an environmental issue. The importance of water quality as a production related issue in mineral beneficiation is greatly underestimated at many mineral processing operations. While most mine sites have comprehensive water balance data for water quantity. the information regarding the quality of water supplies available on site is limited, inadequate or non-existent. The seasonal variations in process water quality and changes in the composition of various water streams are not known. Despite the fact that water represents about 80 to 90 per cent of the volume of mineral pulp processed in a flotation plant. the influence of process water composition on flotation performance is often poorly understood. The process water used at mineral processing operations is made up from a number of available water sources, which can be classified as recycled water streams or make-up waters. The recycled water streams are commonly the tailings and concentrate thickener overflows, filtrate from the concentrate filtration plant and tailings dam return water. Make-up waters can originate from a variety of sources: surface waters (rivers. lakes, reservoirs, dams). groundwater (wells and springs), mains water (potable water), treated and untreated sewage waters and industrial effluents. Mineral processing plants are increasingly recycling water to reduce demand for fresh water and minimise the discharge of wastewater to the environment. However, increasing water recycling can have adverse effects on process water quality and ultimately on the performance of mineral separation processes. The main reasons for reduced plant performance due to water recycling are the accumulation of organic and inorganic compounds in the process water and increased microbiological activities. Other detrimental effects of water recycling can be increased reagent consumption and inefficient dewatering of tailings and concentrates. Recycling of water also tends to accumulate very fine suspended particles. Excessive amounts of slimes in the process water can also have an adverse effect on mineral beneficiation processes. The main constituents of process water are dissolved gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide), colloidal and suspended solids of inorganic and organic nature (including micro-organ isms: dead or alive), dissolved organics (natural organic matter, residual reagents, reaction and decomposition by-products of chemical reagents, impurities in the reagents and metabolites originating from microbiological activities) and inorganic compounds (acids, alkalis, inorganic salts, metal ions, anions and heavy metals). Inputs to the chemical composition of process waters are: dissolution of soluble mineral phases present in the ore, surface oxidation followed by dissolution of mineral particles during grinding and mineral processing. the chemical composition of various make-up waters and recycled water streams, and reagent additions during mineral processing. The beneficial or detrimental impact of process water quality on flotation performance can be attributed to a number of subprocesses: adsorption and/or precipitation of inorganic and organic species present in the process water onto the surface of mineral particles, chemical reactions between process water constituents and the chemical species present on the surface of mineral particles and interactions between the chemical and microbiological species present in the process water and the various reagent species added in solution during mineral processing. Dissolved chemical species such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, lead. zinc. nickel. sulfates. phosphates and carbonates can have a strong effect on the electrokinetic properties of oxide and sulfide minerals, at cerain pH ranges. Several reactions can occur at the solid-liquid interface that can play an important role in determining surface adsorption of reagents. Solid-liquid interfacial properties of mineral particles can be significantly affected by the conformation of adsorbed and precipitated reagent layers, which in turn are determined by solution chemistry. The chemical and microbiological constituents of process water can have a significant effect on liquid-gas interfacial properties and have a strong influence on froth height, strength and stability during flotation. Water chemistry can play an important role in determining the interactions between minerals present in the ore and the chemical reagents added in the mineral processing plant by altering the reagent-solution and mineral-solution equilibria. These interactions can include dissolution, micellisation and precipitation of reagents, dissolution of minerals contained in the ore followed by hydrolysis, complexation, adsorption and precipitation of dissolved chemical species and reactions between dissolved ions and various reagent species present in solution. All of the above mentioned subprocesses can ultimately have a significant effect on the efficiency of mineral processing operations. In this presentation, a systematic approach for assessing the composition of water supplies available at the mine sites and for investigating the influence of process water quality on the efficiency of mineral processing operations will be discussed. The consequences of mining different quality water streams to produce the required volumes of process water for some flotation plants will be highlighted. To substantiate the water quality issues described in this paper some examples are given from a metalliferous processing perspective. However, the topics described in the paper are not only relevant to metalliferous processing but to all other type of mineral processing operations as well. In fact the principles described in this paper have also been successfully applied to the coal flotation industry.																					978-1-920806-57-6				2006							277	+																WOS:000243724400037

Postjuvenile Moult in the Common Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra curvirostra): Photoperiodic Regulation and Its Role in Synchronization of the Annual Cycle	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Captures of Common Crossbills on the southeastern shore of Lake Ladoga and in the St. Petersburg suburbs (1482 individuals from 1968 to 2015) show that the postjuvenile moult is preceded by migration and the overwhelming majority of migrating young birds have plumage that consists solely of juvenile feathers. The postjuvenile moult is recorded from the end of the first ten days of August to the middle of November, the timing of the onset of moult varies within one and a half months with different individuals being observed to have significant distinctions in the number of replaced feathers. The experiments with photoperiodic regulation of the postjuvenile moult were made on 48 individuals captured in nature in the second half of summer and six young birds from one pair of Crossbills, which bred in captivity. The experimental groups were kept in the conditions of a natural decrease in the day (60 degrees N), decrease in the daylength after the transfer from a long day to a short daylength, increasing daylength, constant long daylength, and constant short daylength. The results of the experiments show that the species-specific features of moult in the Common Crossbill are its start being regulated in a wide age range (from 50 to 180 days) and a rather narrow photoperiodic interval of moult with short daylengths (14.5-9 h of daylight). As long as there is more than 14.5 h of daylight, moult begins under the influence of the endogenous rhythm, but not earlier than the age of 4-6 months. The individuals that moult within the photoperiodic interval replace plumage at high rates. After the daylength gets below the lower threshold of the photoperiodic interval, an inhibiting role of the photoperiodic response is activated, terminating moult in the birds that started moult too late, and their plumage mainly retains juvenile generation feathers. Due to the regulation of moult, intrapopulation differences in the timing of annual cycles that are more than seven months at the time of birth of young Common Crossbills decrease almost five times by its start and become even smaller as it ends. It is assumed that this not only makes it possible to implement moult under optimal conditions but also makes first-year birds ready to start breeding in a timely manner if they find themselves in an area with abundantly fruiting spruce trees.

J	VANEERDEN, MR; PIERSMA, T; LINDEBOOM, R				VANEERDEN, MR; PIERSMA, T; LINDEBOOM, R			COMPETITIVE FOOD EXPLOITATION OF SMELT OSMERUS-EPERLANUS BY GREAT CRESTED GREBES PODICEPS-CRISTATUS AND PERCH PERCA-FLUVIATILIS AT LAKE IJSSELMEER, THE NETHERLANDS	OECOLOGIA												The impact of predation by an avian predator (great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus) and a predatory fish (perch Perca fluviatilis) on a common resource, the small planktivorous fish smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) was studied in Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands, in July-October 1985-1988. At this time of the year the grebes are in simultaneous wing-moult and therefore temporarily flightless. Four factors limit the predation pressure by grebes: (1) an underwater visibility threshold of c. 40 cm Secchi depth is the lower limit at which large numbers attend the moulting site, (2) a lower density threshold of exploitable smelt biomass of c. 30 kg/ha determines the actual fishing areas, (3) a fish size threshold of 6.5 cm total length further limits prey availability, and (4) the vertical movements of the prey impose a strong (diel) time constraint on the birds, allowing only crepuscular foraging. Perch, the other main predator in this system, is less restricted in its foraging. Perch were found to be in direct competition with the grebes, preying heavily on the juvenile smelt. Over the 4 years of study 90% of all predation from 15 July to 15 October (72 233 kg/ha) was due to perch. The high level of predation by birds and fish was only possible due to a continuous immigration of smelt into the area (1.45 kg/ha per day). In three of the four years, however, the combined predation by fish and birds surpassed the immigration rate of the prey, which led to a strong reduction in smelt stocks in the study area. A conceptual model is developed to describe the different sets of constraints on the grebes' foraging. First, the state of eutrophication in relation to the weather condition determines the degree of algal blooms, and thus underwater visibility, in late summer. This is the major factor governing the numbers of grebes on the moulting area. Second, the size of the population of predatory fish determines the overall food availability (biomass and size distribution of smelt). These factors are partly interconnected and related to human action (pollution, fisheries). It is suggested that, despite deteriorating visibility conditions, the largest moulting site for grebes in Europe at Lake IJsselmeer exists because the stocks of predatory fish are kept low by overfishing.					; Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012	Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X; 													0029-8549					APR	1993	93	4					463	474		10.1007/BF00328953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00328953								28313813					WOS:A1993KW41400002

Towards a sediment and organic carbon budget for Hudson Bay	MARINE GEOLOGY												A preliminary sediment and organic carbon budget is constructed for the Hudson Bay marine system based on published literature and new data collected from nine rivers and 13 sediment boxcores. The budget considers the main inputs of terrestrial and marine components of sediment and organic carbon and the main sinks (sediment burial) and losses (oxidation, export to Hudson Strait). Sedimentation rates (0.032-0.23 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) were estimated from Pb-210 profiles and a sediment advection-diffusion model in our cores and in two cores collected previously by Lockhart et al. [Lockhart, W.L. et al., 1998. Fluxes of mercury to lake sediments in central and northern Canada inferred from dated sediment cores. Biogeochemistry 40,163-173]. Sedimentation rates implied by the Pb-210 profiles were verified against profiles of Cs-137 and, for some of the cores, contaminant Pb. The sediment sink in Hudson Bay was estimated at 138 (+/- 64) x 10(6) t a(-1) by applying the average sedimentation rate to the area of active sedimentation in the Bay (similar to 15% of the seafloor), calculated according to a regional sedimentation map developed from seismic data [Josenhans, H.W. et al., 1988. Preliminary seismostratigraphic and geomorphic interpretations of the Quaternary sediments of Hudson Bay, Natural Resources Canada]. The known sediment sources to Hudson Bay include river input (11.6 (+/- 6) x 10(6) t a(-1)), subaerial coastal erosion (8 (+/- 4) x 10(6) t a(-1)), marine primary production (24.2 (+/- 17) x 10(6) t a(-1)), and atmospheric deposition (0.5 x 10(6) t a(-1)). Based on the available data, the modern sediment input (44.3 (+/- 18) x 10(6) t a(-1)) represents only about one-third of the apparent sediment sink in Hudson Bay. Resuspension and lateral transport of shallow-water deposits (primarily glacigenic) and winnowing from topographic highs, likely consequences of the exceptional, continuous relative sea-level (RSL) fall in Hudson Bay, provides a plausible source for the similar to 116 x 10(6) t a(-1) imbalance. Using organic carbon and delta C-13 values in the cores, we estimate the burial of particulate organic carbon (POC) in sediments at 1.3 (+/- 0.6) x 10(6) t C a(-1), of which similar to 80% is marine. The importance of reworked glaciomarine carbon to the burial flux is difficult to estimate because modern (autochthonous) primary production provides a large source of POC to the system (16.1 (+/- 7) x 10(6) t C a(-1)) and its degradation is not well-constrained. The 0.58 x 10(6) t C a(-1) terrestrial carbon, estimated to be transported as part of the redistributed sediment load, accounts for almost one-half the total terrigenous POC inputs to the Bay. If sediment and OC supply and burial in the Hudson Bay system are presently responding to the history of isostatic rebound, as proposed here, the task of predicting and measuring the additional consequences of river diversions and climate change (e.g., sea ice, permafrost, runoff) is rendered considerably more difficult.

However, previous studies of Radix have used the shells of unidentified species, and the implications of inter- and intra-specific differences in the geochemical attributes of the shells for paleoenvironmental reconstruction are unclear. Here we report the results of a modern process study and species level classification of Radix based on measurements of the trace element and stable isotope composition of the shells, together with an investigation of the occurrence of living Radix in lakes, wetlands and rivers in the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that vital effects on the trace element and stable isotope composition of the modern aragonite shells of the four most common species (R. auricularia, R. cucunorica, R. lagotis and R. acuminata Lamark) are not big, especially for the two dominant species (R. auricularia and R. cucunorica). Intraspecies differences in both the major elemental ratios and the stable isotopic values can be ignored in the larger shells of R. auricularia (length >14 mm). For different species of Radix of similar sizes, the values of Sr/Ca-shell (<0.0003) and Mg/Ca-shell (<0.0002) are similar in all four common species. By evaluating the importance of vital effects on quantitative paleohydrochemical constructions, we demonstrate that Sr/Ca-shell of Radix is a valuable tool for reconstructing the Sr/Ca ratio and conductivity of the paleo-lake water. However, the Mg/Ca-shell ratios of Radix have no clear environmental implications, possibly because of significant vital effects. Intraspecies differences of <0.4 parts per thousand and interspecies difference of <0.8 parts per thousand for delta O-18(shell) are observed amongst the four species; in addition, the intraspecies (<0.6 parts per thousand) and interspecies variations of delta C-13(shell) of Radix (<1.7 parts per thousand) are larger than those of delta O-18(shell). delta C-13(shell) of the identified Radix mainly reflects the delta C-13(DIC) of the ambient water and is probably limited by DIC, which is of inorganic origin and is seldom limited by DIC derived from the decomposition of organic matter. By evaluating the effects of different transfer functions of living Radix on paleohydrochemical reconstructions (Sr/Capalaeo-water, ECpalaeo-water, delta O-18(palaeo-water) and delta C-13(palaeo-DIC)), we show that the results obtained from transfer functions using R. auricularia and R. cucunorica are very similar, and we recommend the use of transfer functions based on living Radix which are of the same species as the fossil shells. Finally, we show that delta O-18(shell) of both identified and unidentified Radix can be used to determine lake hydrological status (open or closed). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

B.C.)" For Antiquity, the Black Sea is looked upon as a Milesian or even Megaro-Milesian lake owing to the many settlements that sprang into lift during the archaic era. The southern coast of the Black Sea appears as "the poor relation" of archeological research in comparison with the Bulgarian, Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian coasts the exploration of which during the xx. century made possible the study of the cities and their territories, of the relations of the Greeks with the native populations. The Turkish coast of the Black Sea being highly strategic during the Cold War and the Turkish towns occupying the sites of antique cities, the Turkish and international archeological missions had difficulties in undertaking excavations and bringing to light monuments or fossilized antique cadastral surveys. A good many sources (literary, epigraphic and numismatic) make it however possible to write a history of the relations of the Greek cities of the south coast of the Black Sea from the VII c. to the III c. B.C., and evidence the importance of two cities, Heraclea of the Pontus and Sinope. In this article it will therefore be possible to see how the Greek cities of the south coast of the Black Sea react to inroads and assaults from outside (Athenian empire in the middle of the V c., passage of Xenophon and the remainder of the Ten-Thousand in 401-400, revolt of the satrap Damates in 370, the unsettled condition of northern Anatolia within the Persian Empire in the middle of the IV c., Macedonian invasion of Anatolia and territorial ambitions of the Diadoques, establishment of the Bosphoran kingdom). We shall show how solidarities can emerge between Greek cities of the Black Sea's southern coast (Sinope's "colonial" system ?, alliance decree between Sinope and Heraclea in the middle of the IV c, I. K-64 Sinope, no 1) and how these cities had occasionally to appeal to other powers in hellenistic times (Heraclea and the North League, Sinope and Rhodes).																			0031-0387		978-2-8107-0226-8				2012		89					217	+		10.4000/pallas.867	http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/pallas.867													WOS:000312509100012
J	Cecil, CB				Cecil, C. Blaine			An overview and interpretation of autocyclic and allocyclic processes and the accumulation of strata during the Pennsylvanian-Permian transition in the central Appalachian Basin, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Autocyclic and allocyclic processes controlled the lithostratigraphy of strata that accumulated in the central Appalachian foreland basin during the Pennsylvanian and the transition to the Permian. The transition strata, from bottom to top, include the Late Pennsylvanian Pittsburgh and Uniontown formations of the Monongahela Group, the Waynesburg and Washington formations of the Dunkard Group and the Permian Greene Formation of the Dunkard. Variations in the amount of precipitation were the predominant allocyclic control on stratigraphic variations in terrestrial organic productivity, lacustrine base levels, basin-scale weathering, water table and pedogenesis, sediment supply, and sedimentary geochemistry. Tectonic subsidence controlled accommodation space and basin configuration. Eustasy had little or no effect on the stratigraphy of strata deposited in this continental basin during the Pennsylvanian-Permian transition. Autocyclic processes were the predominant spatial control on architecture of alluvial plain aggradation. Paleosols, delineating regional unconformities, show a gradual upward transition from kaolinitic underclay paleosols indicative of a humid climate in the Late Pennsylvanian Monongahela Group to petrocalcic paleosols indicative of a dry subhumid to semiarid climate during deposition of Dunkard strata. As in the Monongahela Group, the Dunkard Group Waynesburg and Washington Formations contain multi-bedded nonmarine lacustrine limestones with subareal exposure features. These limestones grade laterally into petrocalcic paleo-Vertisols in the up-dip alluvial plain. Subareal exposure features are uncommon in centimeter-scale micritic limestones in the Permian Greene Formation; equivalent up-dip paleosols have been lost to erosion. Coal bed continuity, thickness, and quality, also decrease up-section from the very thick (>m) and laterally continuous Pittsburgh Coal at the base of the Monongahela Group to thin (cm scale) and laterally discontinuous coal beds that unconformably overlie the paleosol/underclay/limestone complexes in the Greene Formation. Lacustrine shales and impure (wacke) fluvio-lacustrine sandstones, commonly with a weak pedogenic overprint, generally overlie coal beds. During accumulation of Monongahela and Dunkard (MDG) strata within the basin center, unconformities at the tops of regional paleosols, overlain by lacustrine strata, suggest allocyclic-induced repeated rise and fall of lacustrine conditions in a lacustrine-fan-delta complex analogous to the Okavango basin and fan in Namibia, southern Africa, and/or the Pantanal in southern Brazil. During maximum lake levels, progradation of fluvio-deltaic systems resulted in laminated shale conformably overlain by dark shale and flat-bottomed distributary mouth bar siltstones and sandstones. Prograding distributaries and/or fluvial channels subsequently incised the flat-bottom mouth bar sands. Where basin margin strata are preserved, south of the basin center, depositional environments consist of aggrading alluvial plain sequences with paleosols, fluvial channel sands, and flood plain deposits. Anastomosing fluvial systems prograded across a low gradient (similar to 1 ft/mile; similar to 20 cm/km) alluvial plain into the basin center. A weak pedogenic overprint, marked by ubiquitous root penetrations, occurs throughout most basin-centered fluvial deposits. The subtle but continuous decline in the repetition of cyclic lithostratigraphy up-section in the MDG, particularly in the Greene Formation, appears to be the result of a 10-myr-climate transition from the humid to dry subhumid climate cycles of the Late Pennsylvanian to the equable semiarid to arid climate of the Middle Permian in North America. Cyclothems, common in Pennsylvanian strata, become less distinct up-section in the Dunkard because of decreasing development of underclays, coal, and limestone. This 30-myr period of transition from the humid Pennsylvanian to the arid Permian has been referred to as the Dyassic Period.

J	Abu Ghazleh, S; Kempe, S				Abu Ghazleh, Shahrazad; Kempe, Stephan			Geomorphology of Lake Lisan terraces along the eastern coast of the Dead Sea, Jordan	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Lake Lisan, the lake that filled the Jordan graben during the Last Glacial, left behind a well developed sequence of erosional and depositional shore terraces in the south east of the current Dead Sea. These terraces record a series of stillstands that were caused by small transgressions within an overall trend of falling lake levels. The terraces were observed in places where they had not been identified previously. The morphology of the terraces was investigated in six cross-sections using differential GPS altimetry. The levels of the terraces range between -370 and -148 m a.s.l. The high stand of Lake Lisan at -148 m correlates well with the high level of -150 m reported by Bowman and Gross [Bowman, D., Gross, T., 1992. The highest stand of Lake Lisan: similar to 150 meters below MSL Israel journal of Earth-Science 41, 233-237.] along the western coast of Lake Lisan. The lake terraces are horizontal, elongated and tectonically undisturbed. and have a sub-horizontal foreshore (tread) with an average slope of 8.2 degrees and steep backshore cliff (riser) with an average slope of 17.7 degrees. The six cross-sections show a good altitudinal correlation between their terraces. Moreover, the terraces appear in undisturbed continuity on the aerial photos. These morphological characteristics demonstrate that the retreat of the lake was a result of substantial climatic changes, not of tectonic subsidence. In-situ stromatolites were found on most of the terraces, reflecting a shallow water environment and emphasizing that these terraces are recessional. Well-developed desert varnish and Tafoni observed on blocks sitting on the terrace surfaces imply a long period of exposure and a low rate of post lacustrine erosion. The formation of Lisan terraces is constrained mainly by coastal slope, water depth and underlying lithology. The morphological analysis of these terraces allows identification of two kinds of pseudo-terraces, which were formed as a result of tread or riser destruction. U/Th and OSL dating allowed the dating of three events within the lake level curve more precisely. The high level of -148 m occurred at 30.5 +/- 0.22 ka BP, consistent with the Heinrich Event 3 and Dansgaard-Oeschger stadial 5, the coldest period in the NGRIP Greenland Ice Core record. The next lower terrace at -154 m was formed at 22.9 ka BP +/- 0.29 and corresponds to the stadial 2C, the final phase of the Last High Glacial. The correlation between the Lisan high stands and climatic stadials suggests that Northern-Hemispheric cold periods led to periods with a more positive water balance in the Near East. At similar to 10 +/- 0.8 ka BP Lake Lisan experienced a sharp drop to -200 m followed by a transgression between 9.5 to 7 ka BR (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wright, CI; Miller, WR; Cooper, JAG				Wright, CI; Miller, WR; Cooper, JAG			The late Cenozoic evolution of coastal water bodies in Northern Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa	MARINE GEOLOGY												Three large coastal water bodies (St Lucia, Sibaya and Kosi) of markedly different contemporary morphology occur on the eastern margin of the northern KwaZulu-Natal coastal plain, South Africa. This paper examines their Late Cenozoic evolution and investigates the controls on their evolution that have produced the observed differences in morphology. All three systems origins were due to Mio-Pliocene low sea-level still stands allowing rivers to scour channels into Cretaceous and Palaeocene sedimentary sequences. During the Last Interglacial (oxygen-isotope stage 5e), sea level was approximately 5 m above present level and the morphology of the three systems was similar. An offshore barrier archipelago partially isolated a back-barrier environment that comprised intertidal sand-hats, localised reefs and tidal channels. The area around Bazaruto Island, Mozambique, provides a modern analogy. River rejuvenation and associated incision up to and during the Last Glacial Maximum (16 000-18 000 BP) caused a minimum of -40 m scour which is still reflected in the bathymetry of Lake Sibaya and Kosi. Accumulation of barrier sands partly against pre-existing Interglacial barrier remnants during the Holocene marine transgression (16 000-4500 BP, Ramsay, P.J., 1995. 9000 Years of sea-level change along the South African coastline, Quaternary Int. 27, 1-5.) was responsible for lagoon isolation, although the extent and nature of separation from the sea varies markedly between the systems. The northern part of Lake St. Lucia was closed from the sea during the late Holocene, probably during a sea-level fall from a Holocene high stand of ca. 3 m, at 3000 BP. The Kosi system had a late Pleistocene to early Holocene outlet situated at Bhanga Nek, Lake Nhlange, but this inlet mouth closed approximately at 3000 BP. The present mouth was established by 1600 BP. Lagoonal conditions within Lake Sibaya terminated ca. 5000 BP when coastal barrier dune formation caused complete impoundment and enabled the lake water level to rise to 20 m above mean sea-level. Lake St. Lucia's large catchment has meant that fluvial sediment input has kept pace with the Holocene transgression, whereas the localised drainage associated with Sibaya and Kosi has resulted in a negligible fluvial sediment input allowing for deep lacustrine conditions to develop. Lagoonal segmentation is present to some extent in each system as a result of mobile coastal sediments and their reworking by short-period wind waves. The differential stages of lagoonal segmentation in the three systems can be explained by (a) the presence of cohesive sediment and bedrock around St Lucia which reduce shoreline mobility, and (b) the great water depths in Sibaya compared to Kosi which require longer periods of infilling before segmentation is complete (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Scott			Vulnerability of Early Life-Stage Lake Whitefish and Cisco to Invasive Nearshore Predators	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												In recent years (post 2010), the recruitment of populations of cisco (Coregonus artedi) in the Great Lakes and surrounding inland lakes has generally increased. Conversely, recruitment of lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) populations is declining, in some cases at alarming rates. Differential survival of the two species is likely set during early life stages and may be partially explained by differences in avoidance behaviours, particularly in the presence of more recently introduced nearshore predators, like round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). We evaluated the predation success of three sizes of round goby (small, 59-59 mm total length (TL)), medium, 82-92 mm TL and large, 111-132 mm TL) and one size of rainbow smelt (130-144 mm TL) consuming lake whitefish and cisco at various early life stages-larval, early juvenile and juvenile. Controlled predation trials were conducted and recorded for 30 min. to examine foraging behaviours of potential predators and avoidance patterns of the two coregonine species at the three early life stages. Round goby capture success and attacks per pursuit were primarily related to coregonine life stage (i.e., size), but medium and large round goby had higher success with captures and/or predation efficiency on early juvenile and juvenile lake whitefish than cisco. The number of attacks per pursuit by rainbow smelt was higher on juvenile lake whitefish than cisco, which did not lead to different capture rates. Juvenile cisco exhibited stronger anti-predator response (i.e., tighter group cohesion) than juvenile lake whitefish, which could contribute to lower predation success and/or lower efficiency by introduced predators. Our results suggest that round goby (> 65 mm TL) may have an impact on survival of early juvenile and juvenile lake whitefish, and rainbow smelt may have a larger impact on juvenile lake whitefish than cisco during times of spatial overlap in late spring. Predation by these two invasive fish species in the Great Lakes has the potential to at least partially explain recruitment differences between lake whitefish and cisco.

To understand the patterns of such a relationship between habitat preferences and functional traits of the species, 101 different aquatic sites in the Kastamonu province (Turkiye) were randomly sampled during August 2023. A total of 39 ostracods (20 species, 19 unnamed taxa) were encountered from 49 sites. Seventeen species are new reports for the province. Among them, six species are the most common species with cosmopolitan (or cosmoecious) characteristics. The contribution of these species to the diversity of alpha species (p < 0.05) was more than 90 %. The species with relatively high ecological tolerances generally unveiled low-optimum estimates. Canonical correspondence analysis explained 62.5 % of the correlation between environmental variables and species in which redox potential, electrical conductivity, calcium, and pH were found to be the most related variables to the species (p < 0.05). Fundiversity analysis showed that the presence of swimming setae was correlated with high values of functional diversity, functional richness, and functional distribution of species among five elevation ranges. The results of the habitat selection index and the standardized selection index coincided with the functional traits of the most common species. The species characterized by their habitat selection can be considered as diagnostic species of those specific habitats. Among them, Neglecandona neglecta, reported primarily from dams, springs, and troughs, is considered a typical diagnostic species of these habitats, while Cypridopsis vidua found in lakes and dams can be used as an indicator species for these types of lentic habitats. Similarly, three species ( Heterocypris incongruens, , Ilyocypris bradyi, , Psychrodromus olivaceus) ) can play a critical role as diagnostic species in troughs but reporting them from different habitats such as ditches and rivers / lakes (I. I. bradyi) ) and dams (P. P. olivaceus and H. salina) ) indicated their wide range of habitat preferences. Hence, the results suggest that the occurrence of diagnostic species seems to correspond to certain habitat types and their functional traits.					tunçkol, bilge/AHB-6353-2022; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018	KULKOYLUOGLU, OKAN/0000-0003-4712-5612; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2024	108								126199	10.1016/j.limno.2024.126199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2024.126199		AUG 2024											WOS:001316888800001

Size-selective, additive harvest mortality of Smallmouth Bass in a Missouri River reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Angler harvest of Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu is thought to generally have followed a similar pattern as Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans, decreasing since the 1980s through the rise in voluntary catch and release. However, Smallmouth Bass can be long lived and slow growing, and occupy different types of systems, and angler harvest may be higher in some regions, suggesting that harvest could alter populations. Yet, little contemporary Smallmouth Bass harvest information is available in lotic systems in the northern Midwest. Our objectives were to assess angler size-selective harvest, the number of Smallmouth Bass caught and harvested, and the effect of harvest on Smallmouth Bass survival.Methods We tagged 2,165 Smallmouth Bass from May 23 to September 17, 2019, and from May 19 to September 28, 2021, in three bays of Lake Oahe, South Dakota; estimated weekly exploitation; and assessed potential angler size-selective harvest using angler tag returns. We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber models to test if harvest mortality was compensatory or additive.Results We found that weekly Smallmouth Bass exploitation ranged from 0% to 11.9%, with the highest harvest occurring during late May and early June while generally decreasing through late September. Mean annual Smallmouth Bass exploitation per bay was as low as 13.5% (12.3-14.9%) in Spring Creek during 2021 and as high as 19.4% (17.7-21.4%) in Okobojo Bay during 2021. Anglers harvested larger Smallmouth Bass (median total length = 375 mm) and released smaller Smallmouth Bass (median total length = 338 mm). Smallmouth Bass weekly apparent survival per bay ranged from 0.427 to 0.999 and declined with increasing water temperatures and exploitation, suggesting that harvest mortality is additive.Conclusions Our findings support our hypotheses that anglers harvest larger individuals than those they release, exploitation is higher than other black bass exploitation estimates, and harvest mortality was additive, indicating that Smallmouth Bass angler harvest has the potential to alter populations and needs to be considered when making management decisions. We found that Smallmouth Bass harvest was higher than other northern Midwest black bass populations, harvest probability increased with fish size, and harvest was negatively related with Smallmouth Bass survival.

J	Yanamadala, V				Yanamadala, V			Calcium carbonate phosphate binding ion exchange filtration and accelerated denitrification improve public health standards and combat eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH					United States National Competition Meeting	JUN, 2003	Irving, TX					Cultural eutrophication, the process by which a lake becomes rich in dissolved nutrients as a result of point and nonpoint pollutant sources, is a major cause of the loss of natural lake ecosystems throughout the world. The process occurs naturally in all lakes, but phosphate-rich nutrient runoff from sources such as storm drains and agricultural runoff is a major cause of excess phosphate-induced eutrophication. Especially in Madrona Marsh, one of the last remaining vernal marshes in the greater Los Angeles area, California, cultural eutrophication has become a major problem. In this study, calcium carbonate was found to be an excellent phosphate binder, reducing up to 70% of the phosphates in a given sample of water, and it posed relatively negligent ecological repercussions. This study involved the testing of this principle in both the laboratory and the real ecosystem. A calcium carbonate lacing procedure was first carried out to determine its efficacy in Madrona Marsh. Through this, ammonia was found to interfere with the solubility of calcium carbonate and therefore to be a hindrance to the reduction of phosphate. Therefore, various approaches for reduction of ammonia were tested, including aeration, use of fiber growth media, and plants, mainly Caulerpa verticellata, chosen for it hardiness, primarily in an attempt to increase population of Nitrobacter and Nitrosomonas. All were successful in moderately reducing ammonia levels. In addition, soil sampling, sediment analysis, microscopic plant analysis, microorganism and macroinvertebrate identification, and rate law formulations were conducted. The effect of phosphate and ammonia reduction on the populations of enterobacteria was also an important focus of this experiment. Varying concentrations of phosphate, ammonia, and calcium carbonate in conjunction with phosphate were tested in Madrona Marsh to determine their effects on the populations of enteropathogens on nonspecific blood agar, MacConkey agar, and Hektoen agar. Initial analyses suggest a strong correlation between phosphate concentrations and bacterial Populations; a 66% decrease in phosphate resulted in a 5% reduction in bacterial populations and a 45% reduction in enteropathogenic populations. Likewise, a strong correlation was shown between calcium carbonate concentrations and bacterial reduction greater than that which can be attributed to the phosphate reduction alone. This was followed by the construction of various phosphate binding calcium carbonate filters, which used the ion exchange principle including a spring loading filter, PVC pipe filter, and a galvanized filter. All were tested with the aid of Stoke's law formulation. The experiment was extremely successful in designing a working phosphate-binding and ammonia-reducing filter, and a large-scale agitator-clarifier filter system is currently being planned for construction in Madrona Marsh; this filter will reduce phosphate and ammonia levels substantially in the following years, bringing ecological, economical, and health-related improvements to the overall ecosystem and habitat.																			1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV-DEC	2005	77	7					3003	3012		10.2175/106143005X73884	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143005X73884								16381147					WOS:000233472200004
J	Bunn, AR				Bunn, A. Rex			Resolving the 1886 White Terraces riddle in the Taupo Volcanic Zone	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only the Great Pyramid of Giza survives. Yet there is another, older than the seven, that was found and then lost again in the 19th century and once more located by the research herein: the White Terraces, named Te Tarata by indigenous peoples, of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand. The greatest geoscience and tourist attractions in the southern hemisphere were the siliceous Pink and White Terraces. European, American, and British tourists bypassed the calcareous terraces at Saturnia, Yellowstone, and Pamukkale for the long sea voyage down to New Zealand. The 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption buried the siliceous terraces, decimating their indigenous owners and their tourism. An eruption crater lake now occupies much of the Rotomahana Basin in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, leading to assumptions that the Terraces were lost. However, no evidence was produced. The indigenous Maori owners did not believe they were lost. Controversy ensued. The resolution of this controversy is of economic and cultural importance as well as scientific interest. In 2011, a joint New Zealand-American project claimed to have found the Pink and White Terraces underwater in crater lake but produced no sinter samples. Recently, their claims were refuted. In Europe, terrestrial survey documents were unearthed, including compass bearings to the terraces by the German geologist Ferdinand Hochstetter. His survey records were digitally repatriated, and the reconstruction of his 1859 survey showed that the terrace springs lay outside the eruption crater. This renewed research in the Rotomahana Basin which has resolved the controversy. By studying topography and with the aid of Maori navigation knowledge, the geographic coordinates of the White Terraces have been triangulated and lie on land, on the shoreline outside the 1886 crater. Surprisingly, this evidence demonstrates that the White Terraces could have been located after the 1886 eruption by observation of the Rotomahana Basin with mapping available since 1864. Exploration and excavation of the Terraces are now possible. Even if degraded by the 1886 eruption, the White Terraces may earn a World Heritage listing and a second life in global tourism.

J	JONASSON, PM				JONASSON, PM			EXPLOITATION AND CONSERVATION OF THE THINGVALLAVATN CATCHMENT-AREA	OIKOS												Iceland was settled after AD 870. The fluctuations of the human population of the Thingvallavatn area are known since 1703. The catchment area is well suited and has been used for sheep farming for 1100 years. An increasing grazing pressure, especially during the last 200 years, is documented. The lake has been protected from large scale construction works until 1959. Commercial fishing began at the turn of the century and increased gradually. The fishing pressure, especially on large benthivorous and piscivorous arctic charr and brown trout, apparently peaked after the middle of the century. The fishing pressure on the planktivorous arctic charr for the local market increased moderately up to 1937, but then increased more rapidly due to the favourable prices offered by the canning industry to peak during the last half of this century. The planktivorous charr changed from being the cheapest fish on the local market to become a rare, expensive delicacy for the export market, which caused an 8-fold increase in fishery over a period of 100 years. The first material changes in the limnology of the lake occurred in 1959 after the establishment of the power plant at the outlet and damming of the lake. The ecological effects of this construction are three-fold. First, from then on water-level fluctuations changed from a regular to an irregular pattern. Second, the dam prevented the brown trout population from spawning in the outlet river. The removal of a top predator in a ten thousand years old, well-balanced ecosystem was of profound influence. Now, thirty years later, the consequences are obvious: without access to its main spawning locality the brown trout gradually disappeared from the ecosystem. Third, almost the total population of the american black-fly Simulium vittatum Zett. disappeared from the outlet river Sog when the lake was dammed. Thus the Arctic charr populations lost their main food resource during early summer. Production of electric and geothermal power is at present and will remain the main economic use of the catchment area. Conservation has been going on since 1928. Approximately 25% of the catchment area is within the Thingvellir National Park, a part of which is fenced. The northernmost part of the catchment area has been protected from grazing since 1975.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					32	39		10.2307/3545041	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545041													WOS:A1992JG50900004
C	Rubin, PA; Privitera, JJ		Beck, BF; Stephenson, JB		Rubin, PA; Privitera, JJ			Engineered and unregulated degradation of karst aquifers: Two case studies in New York State, USA	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY OF KARST TERRANES					6th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and the Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karst	APR 06-09, 1997	SPRINGFIELD, MO	P E LaMoreaux & Assoc Inc, SW Missouri State Univ, Dept Geog Geol & Planning, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Mid Missouri Sect, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, St Louis Sect, Assoc Ground Water Scientists & Engineers, Assoc Engn Geologists, Karst Waters Inst				Project engineering in karst terrains must fully consider the potential of degrading underlying karst aquifers, such that groundwater resources are protected. Unfortunately, political and poorly founded regulatory approvals do occur. Two such case studies from southeastern New York State will be used to examine 1) the means by which project approvals were obtained, and 2) defects in environmental law and policy relating to the protection of groundwater resources. Both case studies involve large and deep historic limestone mining operations that may serve to integrate what were once formerly discrete karst aquifer systems by discordantly cutting across them. The risk of degrading aquifers, including extensive flooded mine segments (lakes), from the injection of hydrocarbon-tainted stormwater at the Kingston Business Park site and from herbicide application in Rosendale along a Central Hudson power line is real. Both project approvals hinged on engineering consultants' simple denial of the presence of karst aquifers at these sites, even in the face of overwhelming scientific documentation: sinking streams, sinkholes, caves, springs, borehole voids and dynamic lake level fluctuations. No site-specific hydrogeologic testing, karst investigation or rigorous evaluation of scientific data was done by the project sponsors. No tracer tests were conducted and no wells were drilled to the water table. As a result, the underlying karst aquifers are now in jeopardy. A significant gap in the Federal Clean Water Act is its failure to protect groundwater resources, particularly urban runoff into karst aquifers. The Safe Drinking Water Act endeavors to close this gap with the injection well program, but the regulatory definitions allow unregulated disposal into carbonate formations and New York has chosen to defer to the unprotective federal program. The authors suggest regulatory reform to require 1) recognition of the karst aquifers and their environmental vulnerability to pollutants, 2) proper hydrologic characterization (i.e., ASTM D 5717-95), and 3) protection of underlying aquifers. In the two case studies presented, intervening parties documented the highest and best use of the aquifers and provided detailed hydrologic analyses to all regulatory parties. While much current literature points to the problem of nonpoint source pollution of surface waters as the next frontier, the authors carefully parse the regulations and document the critical gaps in law and policy which threaten groundwater. Regulatory change and other recommendations are provided for others involved in similar situations.																					90-5410-867-3				1997							467	476																WOS:A1997BH94W00064

Law enforcement is not easy because of the vagueness of its space limits. This paper discusses the interpretation and application of the legislation, in determining of Areas of permanent preservation related to relief. The purpose was to indicate all the categories set in two watersheds, Joao Leite river and Extrema river, looking for the result for the real area of permanent preservation and the conflicts arising from its use. By doing this it has been mapped eight categories of permanent preservation, in the two watersheds: marginal bands of 30 meters and 50 meters in rivers; marginal bands in lakes and reservoirs; marginal radius of 50 meters on springs; retreat of 100 meters at the edges of plates; Hill Tops; divide lines and escarpments. In this text it was also prepared maps of the surface use in the two watersheds, to correlate with the areas of permanent preservation. In the Basin of Joao Leite River, only 22.23% are covered by remnants of vegetation in which the predominance is pastures, that covers 65% of the area. In the Extrema River, 43.62% are covered by remnants, which have also predominance of pastures, covering 48.34%. For the areas of permanent preservation, in Joao Leite River, the total was the amount of 18.25% of its area. In the Extrema River, 26.82% are covered by areas of permanent preservation, and the classes of hill tops are predominant in both. Clearly there is a discrepancy between the patterns of use and occupation, in Joao Leite River, 62.07% of all the areas of permanent preservation are under use, and in the Extrema River this scenario is quite different with 78.2% of preservation in areas of permanent preservation. Among the most respected categories, the situation is the same, the geomorphological areas of permanent preservation, mainly by the slope, are the most preserved, on the other hand the margins of water streams and reservoirs are the most affected. This indicates that the permanent preservation areas are the results of rules that are often broken but not followed.

Construction and Functioning of Andrushiv Port on the Dnipro near Pereyaslav, Poltava Province in the 2nd Half of 19th - the Early 20th Century	STORINKY ISTORIYI-HISTORY PAGES												Navigation on the Dnipro, Ukraines' largest waterway, remains a significant research topic. The period from the second half of the 19th to the early 20th century represents the most active phase of shipping development. Recent years have witnessed renewed interest in this subject, driven by the revival of freight and passenger traffic on the river. Among the least-studied aspects of navigation during the imperial era is the creation and operation of the Andrushivka pier near Pereyaslav in Poltava province. While briefly mentioned in works on hydrology, geography, shipping, and local history, this pier has not yet been the subject of a comprehensive historical investigation. Based on annual resolutions, Zemstvo reports, and scholarly works in hydrology, geography, and shipping, this article explores the history and operational dynamics of the Andrushivka steamship pier on the Dnipro River, located near Pereyaslav in Poltava province during the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The research clarifies the source base, characterizes the piers' distinctive features, assesses its cargo turnover, identifies key operational challenges, and delineates areas requiring further scholarly investigation. The Andrushivka pier was among the oldest and most renowned Dnipro piers. It entered the history ofDnipro navigation in the 17th-19th centuries as a << bread pier,>> playing a crucial role in the regions' wholesale grain trade. Most contemporary publications documented the priority of grain goods in the piers' cargo turnover and the active participation of local Jews in these operations. With the development of steamship navigation on the Dnipro in the 1840-1850s, the Andrushivka pier also gained passenger transportation significance. The specifics of organizing transport and passenger services through the Andrushivka pier were primarily determined by a limited navigation period, the absence of a stable pier location, distance from Pereyaslav, and inconvenient land access routes. Overall, the Dnipro section near the Andrushivka pier was quite challenging for navigation. Dangerous conditions were created by stone obstacles, numerous shallow areas, sandy banks, the unsystematic river current, and its division into multiple branches and lakes. The most significant problem in the piers' functioning was the transportation of cargo and passengers during spring floods. Further study of the topic could be directed towards researching the access routes to the pier, upon which its operation largely depended.

Continental margin of the eastern United States: past and present. In: Speed, R.C., (Ed.), Phanerozoic Evolution of North American Continent-Ocean Transitions. DNAG Continent-Ocean Transect Volume. Geological Society of America, Boulder, Colorado, pp. 129-218]. Volcanic island-arc rocks of the Avalon terrane are in contact with Central Maine terrane rocks in southern Connecticut where the latter are overthrust onto the Brompton-Cameron terrane, which is thrust over Laurentian basement. Similarities of these allochthonous island arc terranes (Brompton-Cameron, Central Maine, Avalon) in lithology, fauna and age suggest that they are faulted segments of the margin of one major late Precambrian to early Paleozoic, high latitude peri-Gondwana island arc designated as "Avalonia", which collided with Laurentia in the early to middle Palcozoic. The Brompton Cameron, Central Maine, and Avalon terranes are projected as the basement under the eastern New Jersey Coastal Plain based on drill core samples of metamorphic rocks of active margin/magmatic are origin. A seismic reflection profile across the New York Bight traces the gentle dipping (approximately 20 degrees) Cameron's Line Taconian suture southeast beneath allochthonous Avalon and other terranes to a 4 sec TWTT depth (approximately 9 km) where the Avalonian rocks are over Laurentian crust. Gentle up-plunge (approximately 5 degrees) projections to the southwest bring the Laurentian Grenville age basement and the drift-stage early Paleozoic cover rocks to windows in Burlington Co. at approximately 1 km depth and Cape May Co. at approximately 2 km depths. The antiformal Shellburne Falls and Chester domes and Chain Lakes-Pelham dome-Bronson Hill structural trends, and the synformal Connecticut Valley-Gaspe structural trend can be traced southwest into the New Jersey Coastal Plain basement. A Mesozoic rift basin, the "Sandy Hook basin", and associated eastern boundary fault is identified, based upon gravity modeling, in the vicinity of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The thickness of the rift-basin sedimentary rocks contained within the "Sandy Hook basin" is approximately 4.7 kin, with the basin extending offshore to the east of the New Jersey coast. Gravity modeling indicates a deep rift basin and the magnetic data indicates a shallow magnetic basement caused by magnetic diabase sills and/or basalt flows contained within the rift-basin sedimentary rocks. The igneous sills and/or flows may be the eastward continuation of the Watchung and Palisades bodies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Oriol			Numerical modeling of a multilayer coastal aquifer in extreme drought with additional exploitation and impact on its associated ecosystems: Jucar river and La Albufera de Valencia (Plana de Valencia Sur, Spain)	BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO												La Plana de Valencia Sur (MASub 080.142) constitutes a coastal hydrogeological system with high potential, which gives it great aptitude so that it can be considered as a strategic aquifer, understanding as such that it can be exploited in a short-term and intensive way during times of drought in order to compensate for the deficit created in demand systems. For this purpose, in the mid-90s and the first decade of this century, a large number of groundwaters catchments were built that were used during the extremely dry period from 2005 to 2008. This additional and scheduled exploitation required a meticulous piezometric and hydrochemical monitoring, as well as the volumes extracted, which was carried out by the Jucar Hydrographic Confederation (CHJ) and the Geological Survey of Spain (IGME). The data obtained allowed us to know the response of the system to a situation of exceptional water stress and to develop a detailed model of underground flow with the Visual MODFLOW software. The model domain, discretised in 4,357 cells of 359x359 m, covers an area of 56,15 km(2) and consists of four layers equivalent to the four geological formations that comprise it. With its calibration and adjustment in steady state and transitory flow regimes, the aquifer balance has been determined, as well as its behaviour and evolution. One of the most relevant aspects is that it incorporates in a different way the main ecosystems dependent on groundwater: Jucar and Verde rivers, ullales or springs, drainage channels and La Albufera lake, in addition to direct outlets to the sea. The conclusions obtained include, at a general level, the suitability of the actions carried out and their environmental viability, confirming its good characteristics as a strategic aquifer, as well as its ability to be exploited intensively during times of extreme weather conditions. It also analyses, in a particularized way, the consequences that the intensive exploitation of the system has had on each of the different elements that make up its water balance, which has allowed us to know the conditions suffered by the two large ecosystems with which it is related, Jucar River and La Albufera de Valencia, throughout the period analysed.

J	Dobroliubskii, A; Smyrnov, I				Dobroliubskii, Andrii; Smyrnov, Ihor			The Burial of Unknown Alan near Lake Katlabukh	EMINAK												The paper is devoted to the study of the burial of the Alan warrior in one of the barrows near Lake Kalabukh on the left bank of the Lower Danube. A hoard of 13 coins of three Byzantine emperors was found there: Manuel I Comnenus (1143-1180), Andronicus Comnenus (1183-1185), and Isaac Angelos (1185-1195). This gives us the opportunity to date the burials not earlier than the 1190s. Putting such coins into the grave gave the deceased a special prestige. In the 12th - 13th centuries, the Alans-Ases together with the Cumans-Kypchaks (Polovtsian) inhabited the lowlands of the Dniester and the Danube. In the scientific sources, they are called `Brodnyks'. The Kypchaks in the 1190s were allies of the Bulgarians in their war against the Byzantine Empire. And the Alans-Brodnyks from the Danube region united into special units, `engineering troops', which `professionally' provided the crossing of the Danube by the Kypchaks. And <<... the Bulgarians, having Scythians as the allies, did much damage to the Roman possessions.>> Therefore, << Emperor Isaac had to concentrate all the forces of the Romans in one army,>> writes Georgios Akropolites, << and move it against them...>>. However, in the spring of 1190, << while passing through a narrow place (Trevnenski pass), he was attacked by the Bulgarians, who scattered the whole army and seized all the stock belonging not only to troops but also to the emperor himself... took a rich booty from the Romans. precious imperial accessories (they got emperor's pyramids, vessels of nobles, a huge amount of money.>>. After the victory over the Byzantines, the Alans-Brodnyks together with the Kypchaks took part in the division of the war booty and returned to the Danube region. Some part of the `huge amount of money' appeared to be, as you can see, in `our' burial. It was made a little later in 1190, and the deceased was one of the war leaders, who in that military campaign, indisputably, distinguished himself. He was supposedly an honored and respected man in his circle that's why he was buried with due respect at the very top of the barrow. And, as a mark of such respect, some money, the part of his war booty, was put into his grave.																			1998-4634	2708-0226				JAN-MAR	2021		1			SI		308	317		10.33782/eminak2021.1(33).509	http://dx.doi.org/10.33782/eminak2021.1(33).509													WOS:000904724500021

It belongs to the European Union's Natura 2000 programme in Finland, and has been included in regional and national monitoring programmes since the 1960s. The main monitoring station is situated near the outlet of the lake. Deterioration of its water quality was suspected already in the 1980s because of decreasing Secchi depths (transparency) and increasing chlorophyll a. The occurrence of algal blooms on the lakeshores is monitored weekly during each summer at one site on Lake Pyhajarvi (site 1). This is a part of nationwide intensive algae monitoring programme organised by the environmental authorities together with voluntary observers at some 270 lake sites in Finland since 1998. Since t997, Secchi depth observations have been carried out by volunteers biweekly or monthly at 17 sites on the lake. In the vicinity of one of these transparency observation sites (station 100), intensive monitoring of algae has been carried out. At this lakeshore monitoring site 69 algal observations were made, ten of which recorded algal blooms during the study period 1998-2002. The observed algal blooms were caused by algae of the Anabaena species, mainly by Anabaena lemmermannii. At Lake Pyhajarvi the number of algal bloom observations received from the public have decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. The range of Secchi disc transparency was 5.0-8.4 in with a mean value of 6.2 m at station 100 and 4.3-7.7 in (mean 6.1 in) at the main monitoring station 2 during the open water periods in 1998-2002. During this study period, the maximum values at site 100 seem to have increased slightly, which might indicate some improvement in the water quality due to decreased point source loading. We conclude that the intensive algal monitoring results of 5 years at the lakeshore site and the transparency results - both compiled by trained volunteers - reflect an improvement in the state of Lake Pyhajarvi in Karelia. This conclusion is in accordance with the long-term water quality and short-core studies of sedimentary diatoms in Lake Pyhajarvi. We suggest that the intensive algal observations and transparency measurements are both suitable methods for the monitoring, of lakeshores and lakes, and that both are suitable for voluntary monitoring. We found public participation a good tool for monitoring takes and lakeshores.																			0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					154	159		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80035-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80035-5													WOS:000222030800021

The M-KMA is one of the most significant wilderness areas in North America, with extensive forests, spectacular geological formations, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, hot springs, subalpine and alpine areas, and major wetlands. It is home to a huge variety of wilderness and wildlife-much of the wilderness is ecologically sensitive and some of the wildlife is threatened or endangered. The M-KMA encompasses large oil and gas reserves, and the energy sector is a major employer in the area. The central and western areas of the M-KMA are high in metallic and nonmetallic resources. Exploration projects have been established, and there is small-scale mining of sand and gravel. Portions of the M-KMA have high timber values, with over 40 percent of the Fort Nelson (one of British Columbia's most northerly communities) economy being driven by the forest sector. The management model at M-KMA is intended to establish a world standard for environmental and economic stability. The management intent of the M-K MA is to maintain in perpetuity the wilderness values, the diversity and abundance of wildlife, and the ecosystems on which it depends. There is significant ongoing research, inventory, planning, enforcement, education, and extension funded by a trust fund that can annually award up to $3 million to supplement government base funding in the area. Projects are awarded to government agencies, First Nations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector to undertake work directly related to the M-KMA. This paper will address the challenges of protecting and sustaining wilderness values in the Muskwa-Kechika Management Area while also attempting to manage multiple natural resource uses (trapping, hunting, oil and gas, mineral extraction, timber extraction, ecotourism, recreation, and so forth). Additional challenges stein from the commodity-based nature of the extractive industries within a global market and the uncertainties with respect to First Nations rights and claims. The paper will lay out the history of the M-KMA, review management challenges, and address five lessons learned that could apply to other such areas.																									2001		27					104	109																WOS:000221665300016

To better understand these other Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermals and their utility for stratigraphic correlation between marine and terrestrial deposits, we performed carbon- and oxygen-isotope analysis of lacustrine sedimentary rocks from the ZK0303 well in the southwestern Jianghan data, the 320-1000 m section of the well repate (813Ccarb) and bulk organic matter (OM; shifts. Based on a stratigraphic comparison with global marine and continental records from the same period, the three negative CIEs observed were assigned to three hyperthermals: the PETM, the ETM2/H1, and the H2 events. The recorded magnitudes of the CIEs of the 813Ccarb values of the PETM, ETM2/H1, and H2 (-10.1%0, -6.7%0, and -5.6%0) are greater than those of the 813Corg parison to the vast ocean, which responded more slowly to the increase in humidity and pCO2 concentration and had stronger buffering capacity during the PETM, the smaller Jianghan Basin was more intensely affected by the increase in the pCO2 concentration and especially the increase in humidity. This resulted in a CIE magnitude of the 813Corg value (-4.40%0) significantly larger than those of marine records. The climate during the PETM was very humid and hot, with flourishing vegetation, enhanced soil respiration, increased OM oxidation, and higher runoff. This resulted in a significant decrease in the 813C value of dissolved inorganic carbon in the lake. In contrast, the climate was relatively dry during the ETM2/H1 and H2 events, the lake level declined, and groundwater (springs) probably constituted the main water supply to the lake, with runoff playing a lesser role. The discovery of the three hyperthermals in the ZK0303 well reveals that the humid climate of the Paleocene-Eocene in the Jianghan Basin began during the PETM and ended during the ETM2/H1 and H2 events.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				2025 JUL 10	2025										10.1130/B37650.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B37650.1		JUL 2025											WOS:001529863300001
J	Magny, M; Thew, N; Hadorn, P				Magny, M; Thew, N; Hadorn, P			Late-glacial and early Holocene changes in vegetation and lake-level at Hauterive/Rouges-Terres, Lake Neuchatel (Switzerland)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Palynological and sedimentological analyses of a sedimentary sequence sampled at Hauterive/Rouges-Terres, Lake Neuchatel (Switzerland) provide documentation of changes in vegetation and lake-level during the Bolling, Younger Dryas and Preboreal pollen zones, and have allowed a comparison with sequences covering the same period from other sites located in the western part of the Swiss Plateau. The Juniperus-Hippophae zone (regional pollen assemblage zone (RPAZ) CHb-2, first part of the Bolling, ca. 14650-14450 cal. yr BP) was characterised by a generally low lake-level. A weak rise occurred during this zone. The Juniperus-Hippophae to Betula zone transition coincided with a lake-level lowering, interrupted by a short-lived but marked phase of higher lake-level recorded at the neighbouring site of Hauterive-Champreveyres, but not present at Hauterive/Rouges-Terres owing to an erosion surface. Shortly after the beginning of the Betula zone (RPAZ CHb-3, second part of the Bolling, ca 14 450-14 000 cal. yr BP), a marked rise in lake-level occurred. It was composed of two successive periods of higher level, coinciding with high values of Betula, separated by a short episode of relatively lower lake-level associated with raised values in Artemisia and other non-arboreal pollen. The last part of RPAZ CHb-3 saw a fall in lake-level. The lower lake-levels during RPAZ CHb-2 to early RPAZ CHb-3 can be correlated with the abrupt warming at the beginning of the Greenland Interstadial (GI) le thermal maximum. The successive episodes of higher lake-level punctuating the GI 1e might be linked to the so-called Intra-Bolling Cold Oscillations identified from several palaeoclimatic records in the North Atlantic area, and also documented in oxygen-isotope data sets from Swiss Plateau lakes. The Hauterive/Rouges-Terres lake-level record provides evidence for marked climatic drying through the second part of the Younger Dryas event (GS1), during the GS1-Preboreal (RPAZ CHb-4b-4c) transition (except for a rise at ca. 11450-11400 cal. yr BP), and at the RPAZ CHb-4c-5 (Preboreal-Boreal) transition, following the Preboreal Oscillation (after 11 150 cal. yr BP). The Preboreal Oscillation coincided with higher lake-levels, its end being followed by a rapid expansion of Corylus, Quercus, Ulmus and Tilia. The Hauterive/Rouges-Terres lake-level record suggests that radiocarbon plateau at 12 600, 10000 and 9500 C-14 yr BP corresponded to periods of generally lower lake-level. This suggests that an increase in solar activity may have contributed to both climatic dryness and a decrease in atmospheric radiocarbon content.

Increased sediment connectivity between deltas and deep-water fans in closed lake basins: A case study from Bozhong Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The connection between deltaic clinothem growth and the formation of down-dip deep-water systems on continental margins has been extensively discussed as a crucial component of sequence stratigraphic theory. However, in lacustrine settings, the growth of deltaic clinothems and outlying deep-water fans remains comparatively poorly understood. In the southwestern Bozhong Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China, both lacustrine deltas and outlying sub-lacustrine fans were developed during the Oligocene, providing an opportunity to investigate the connection between lacustrine deltaic clinothem growth and the formation of outlying sub-lacustrine fans in deep-lacustrine systems. We employ 3D seismic data, well data, core data, and sandstone grainsize data to analyze the stacking patterns and internal architectures of these two sedimentary systems in the lower and upper successions of our study interval, SQEd2L. In addition, elemental geochemical parameters were utilized to reveal the paleoclimatic signature of the different stratigraphic successions. Our results suggest that there are two main types of deltaic clinothem stacking patterns in the lower and upper successions of SQEd2L, respectively: (1) in the lower succession, progradational to aggradational stacking patterns have a flat to steeply rising rollover trajectory, and (2) in the upper succession, aggradational to progradational and degradational stacking patterns have a slightly rising to flat and slightly falling trajectory. Meanwhile, the sub-lacustrine fans with straight channels and thick lobe complexes are coupled with progradational and aggradational (PA) deltaic clinothems in the lower succession. In the upper succession, small-scale sub-lacustrine fans with sinuous channels and thin lobe complexes are coupled with aggradational to progradational and degradational (APD) deltaic clinothems. The sediment connectivity between lacustrine deltas and sub-lacustrine fans stands in stark contrast to their counterparts in marine basins (such as marine APD clinothems coupled with large-scale deep-water fans, while marine PA clinothems rarely produce deep-water fans). In addition, two contrasting paleoclimatic stages have been identified in SQEd2L, namely the earlier humid stage in the lower succession and the later semiarid climatic stage in the upper succession. A comprehensive analysis of the differences between lacustrine and marine basins indicates that climatic variations play a pivotal role in deep-lacustrine deposition. Consequently, a climate-cycle-driven, sediment-supply-dominated sedimentary model of delta-to-fan sediment connectivity is proposed that incorporates the efficiency of terrigenous sediment dispersal into deep-lacustrine floors and the architecture of sublacustrine fans. The findings of this study further refine the implementation of the sequence stratigraphy paradigm and enhance the understanding of delta-to-fan sediment connectivity in deep-lacustrine depositional systems.					; LI, DONGWEI/JJE-8110-2023; puyu, Liu/HTP-3191-2023; Gearon, James/HMP-7491-2023	Liu, Puyu/0009-0003-3329-6661; Gearon, James/0000-0002-0115-7937													0037-0738	1879-0968				FEB	2024	460								106561	10.1016/j.sedgeo.2023.106561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2023.106561		DEC 2023											WOS:001152650800001
J	Blair, TC; Mcpherson, JG				Blair, Terence C.; Mcpherson, John G.			Quaternary sedimentology of the Rose Creek fan delta, Walker Lake, Nevada, USA, and implications to fan-delta facies models	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The 3.2 km long Rose Creek fan delta of west-central Nevada is prograding from an active rift margin into the 32 m deep Walker Lake. A case study of the forms, processes and facies of this fan delta reveals that the proximal and medial zones mainly are of sub-aerial origin, and the distal zone is of lacustrine origin. Pebbly to bouldery rock-avalanche mounds > 100 m thick (Facies A) and muddy to bouldery debris flow levees 0.5 to 2.0 m thick (Facies B) dominate the proximal zone, whereas mostly matrix-supported cobbly pebbly debris flow lobes 0.1 to 1.0 m thick (Facies C) typify the medial zone. Surficial pebble lags and gully fills (Facies D) are widespread in both zones but, in exposures, comprise only partings or lenticles between debris flow units. The distal fan delta mainly consists of lakeshore to lake-bottom tracts formed by extensive wave reworking of debris flow facies. Nearshore deposits include erosional cobbly boulder lag beaches (Facies E), pebbly constructional beaches attached at headcuts or on barrier spits (Facies F), pebbly upper shoreface (Facies G) and sandy lower shoreface (Facies H) tracts positioned lakeward of the beach, and pebbly landward-dipping foresets (Facies I) and backshore-pond sand and mud (Facies J) present landward of the spits. Erosional lag beaches fringe the windward north side of the fan-delta front, attached constructional beaches characterize the central zone, and southward-elongating barrier spits typify the leeward south side, extending from the zone of greatest projection of the fan delta into the lake. Shoreline facies asymmetry results from largely unidirectional longshore drift caused by high fetch to the north and minimal fetch to the south, combined with the arcuate shape of the fan-delta front. The spits overlie a platform deposited below common wave base consisting of south-east-trending cones of pebbly Gilbert foresets (Facies K) and sandy toesets (Facies L). Typically slumped silt and mud (Facies M) fringe both this platform and lower shoreface sand in deeper water. This case demonstrates facies types and patterns that are inconsistent with the widely promoted fan-delta facies model having a front consisting of an apron of radially directed Gilbert foresets deposited where sub-aerial flows enter the lake. The Rose Creek fan-delta front instead features a sharp contact between sub-aerial and lakeshore facies formed where waves erode, sort and redistribute heterogeneous debris flow sediment into the various shallow-to-deep lake facies. Gilbert foresets are present only in the lee of the fan delta where sediment moving by longshore drift reaches the brink of the spit front. This facies scenario results from the infrequency of fan-building events versus nearly constant wind-induced waves, a scenario that, in contrast to the popular Gilbert model, probably is the norm for fan deltas. The level of Walker Lake, and thus the position of wave reworking on the Rose Creek fan delta, fluctuated over a range of similar to 157 m during the last 18 kyr, producing complex interfingering between sub-aerial and lakeshore facies across a 1700 m wide radial belt, typifying a wave-modified, freestand lacustrine fan delta.																			0037-0746					JUN	2008	55	3					579	615		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00913.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2007.00913.x													WOS:000255836400005

Rhyolitic melt production in the midst of a continental arc Hare-up-The heterogeneous Caspana ignimbrite of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex of the Central Andes	GEOSPHERE												The similar to 5 km(3), 4.54-4.09 Ma Caspana ignimbrite of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex (APVC) of the Central Andes records the eruption of an andesite and two distinct rhyolitic magmas. It provides a unique opportunity to investigate the production of silicic magmas in a continental arc flare-up, where small volumes of magma rarely survive homogenization into the regional magmatic system that is dominated by supereruptions of monotonous dacitic ignimbrites. The fall deposit and thin flow unit that record the first stage of the eruption (Phase 1) tapped a crystal-poor peraluminous rhyolite. The petrological and geochemical characteristics of Phase 1 are best explained by partial melting of or reheating and melt extraction from a granodioritic intrusion. Phase 2 of the eruption records the emplacement of a more extensive flow unit with a crystal-poor, fayalite-bearing rhyolite and a porphyritic to glomeroporphyritic andesite containing abundant plagioclase-orthopyroxene-Fe-Ti oxide (norite) glomerocrysts. The isotopic composition of Phase 2 is significantly more "crustal" than Phase 1, indicating a separate petrogenetic path. The mineral assemblage of the noritic glomerocrysts and the observed trend between andesite and Phase 2 rhyolite are reproduced by rhyolite-MELTS-based models. Pressure-temperature-water (P-T-H2O) estimates indicate that the main (Phase 2) reservoir resided between 400 and 200 MPa, with the andesite recording the deeper pressures and a temperature range of 920-1060 degrees C. Rhyolite phase equilibria predict an estimated temperature of similar to 775 degrees C and similar to 5 wt% H2O. Pressures derived from phase equilibria indicate that the rhyolite was extracted directly from the noritic cumulate at similar to 340 MPa and stored at slightly shallower pressures (200-300 MPa) prior to eruption. The rhyolite-MELTS models reveal that latent-heat buffering during the extraction and storage process results in a shallow liquidus during the extensive crystallization that produced a noritic cumulate in equilibrium with a rhyodacitic residual liquid. Spikes in latent heat facilitated the segregation of the residual liquid, creating the pre-eruptive compositional gap of similar to 16 wt% SiO2 between the andesite and the Phase 2 rhyolite. Unlike typical Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex (APVC) magmas, low fO(2) conditions in the andesite promoted co-crystallization of orthopyroxene and ilmenite in lieu of clinopyroxene and magnetite. This resulted in relatively high Fe concentrations in the rhyodacite and Phase 2 rhyolite. Combined with the co-crystallization of plagioclase, this low oxidation state forced high Fe-2(+)/Mg and Fe/Ca in the Phase 2 rhyolite, which promoted fayalite stability. The dominance of low Fe3+/Fe-Tot and Fe-Ti oxide equilibria indicates low fO(2) (Delta FMQ 0 - Delta FMQ - 1) conditions in the rhyolite were inherited from the andesite. We propose that the serendipitous location on the periphery of the regional thermal anomaly of the Altiplano-Puna magma body (APMB) permitted the small-volume magma reservoir that fed the Caspana ignimbrite eruption to retain its heterogeneous character. This resulted in the record of rhyolitic liquids with disparate origins that evaded assimilation into the large dacite supereruption-feeding APMB. As such, the Caspana ignimbrite provides a unique window into the multiscale processes that build long-lived continental silicic magma systems.					de Silva, Shanaka/A-4630-2011; Lewis, Charles/HJA-8617-2022	de Silva, Shanaka/0000-0002-0310-5516; Lewis, Charles/0000-0001-5848-937X; Burns, Dale/0000-0001-6062-6230; 													1553-040X					DEC	2022	18	6					1679	1709		10.1130/GES02462.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02462.1		SEP 2022											WOS:000860699000001

The surrender of the March 23 (M23) rebels, followed by overtures to incorporate the same into the Congolese military and political institutions, seem not to have made much significant impact on the security stability in the eastern part of the country. Armed activities by militia groups such as the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR), Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), and various Mayi Mayi groups are likely to cause a recurrence of a fully fledged armed conflict in the eastern Congo. Whilst the UN Mission for the Stabilisation of Congo (MONUSCO), along with its Intervention Brigade continue to make efforts to support the Congolese government to address the security situation in the country, this article presents a critical analysis on the prospects and constraints of SADC to sustainably resolve the conflict (the intervention problematique) and build peace in the context of conflict recurrence. For purposes of conflict resolution and peacebuilding, the DRC falls within SADC's area of sub-regional responsibility, which overlaps into that of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). The paper looks at the political/diplomatic and military/security initiatives that SADC can take to complement the current efforts of critical role players such as MONUSCO and the ICGLR in sustainably resolving the recurring conflict and building peace. It also analyses the prospects of such sub-regional initiatives. Considering the conflict matrix of the eastern Congo conflict with specific reference to its recurrence, an examination of the likely constraints that SADC could encounter in trying to resolve the eastern Congo conflict will be presented. Policy suggestions will be proffered on what can be done to encounter such constraints. The research adopted a qualitative approach premised on interviews. Secondary sources, including key policy documents and statements of the SADC, AU, ICGLR and UN, were utilised. As complementing primary sources, structured opportunity interviews were conducted at seminars and workshops with academics and senior political and security analysts conversant with SADC conflict and peace dynamics.																					978-983-44661-9-0				2016							305	328																WOS:000445013600027
J	FELLERDEMALSY, MJ; PARENT, J				FELLERDEMALSY, MJ; PARENT, J			POLLEN ANALYSIS OF HONEYS FROM ONTARIO, CANADA	APIDOLOGIE												This study was carried out on 17 samples of honey from the south of the province of Ontario, Canada, where apiculture is concentrated. Most of the samples were collected in 1983 (Fig 1.). Most of the honey sampled had a moderate number of pollen grains/10 g of honey. Pollen analysis showed 60 pollen forms, of which 50 came from melliferous and 10 from non-melliferous plants (Tables 1, II, and III). The number of pollen types in honeys encompassed a large range of of classes from 6-10 to 31-35 forms (Fig. 2). The average number of pollent types per honey was 21, higher than in honeys from the Prarie provinces and from Quebec, Canada, probably because of the southern situation of this part of Ontario. Six pollen forms present in 80% and more of the samples are characteristic of this region: Lotus, Trifolium hybridum/ T. repens, Melilotus, Salix, Trifolium pratense and the Solidago type. Half of the honey samples were unifloral > 45% pollen of one taxon in sample, cf. Louveaux et al., 1978). The predominance of Lotus and of Trifolium hybridum/T. repens were the most numerous (Table IV). The predominance of Brassicaceae (others) seems to be fortuitious. One case of honey from Tilia, taxon, of which the pollen is normally under-represented, was shown. This was confirmed by the number of grains/10 g of honey (Table V). Among the very frequent pollen types (> 50%), besides Lotus and Trifolium hybridum/ T/repens, Melilotus and the Solidago type fall in the class of secondary pollen (16-45%) (Table IV); Salic, Trifolium pratensem, the fruit trees, Rubus Rhus typhina and the Rosaceae (folded) enter into the class of important minor pollens (3-15%). Honeys of Trifolium hybridum /T. repens were collected throughout southern Ontario while the honeys of Lotus seemed to be characteristic of the western part of this region. The pollen of Echium vulgare seemed to be characteristic of the eastern region; the pollens of Viburnum, Lythrum salicaria and Cornus were very frequent (> 50%) in honeys from the territory adjacent to Lake Ontario and to St-Lawrence River to the Ottawa River (Table VI). Pollens of non-mleliferous plants were more frequent in honeys from Ontario than in honeys from the Prairie provinces. In floral composition the honeys from Ontario were close to honeys from the west of Quebec and of some honeys from the eastern Manitoba, Canada. Lotus corniculatus pollen was previously unreported as a characteristic component of honey.																			0044-8435	1297-9678					1989	20	2					127	138		10.1051/apido:19890203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/apido:19890203													WOS:A1989AB66100003

The lake has eutrophic hardwater characteristics. Temperature, pH value, total dissolved substance, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total hardness, carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinity, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, sulphate, soluble reactive silica, secchi disc depth, water depth, water volume, and chlorophyll a values were measured. Physical and chemical variables were determined from samples taken monthly at 10 stations from July 1998 to June 1999 to assess the present status of the lake. Significant correlations between physical and chemical variables were observed, and these relationships reflected the interactions among internal nutrient loadings. Two-way ANOVA test results also showed spatial and temporal variations. Internal nutrient loadings have been stimulated by a combination of different factors. Principal-component analyses showed that pH and alkalinity were the major factors that influenced the internal nutrient loadings in the lake. Results also indicated that nitrate, sulphate, and soluble reactive silica concentrations significantly induced the soluble reactive phosphorus loading. Direct or indirect interactions among primary nutrients were important in the nutrient loading in Lake Uluabat. Mustafakemalpa, sa stream and its two branches Orhaneli and Emet, which drain into the lake, receive sewage water from households and industry. For this reason, soluble reactive phosphate, sulphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, boron, and suspended solids were determined in samples collected bi-monthly from the Ayazkoy station located on the Mustafakemalpa, sa stream during the same study period to determine the effects of the main streams on the lake. Results indicated that the pollution load of Lake Uluabat is highly affected by Mustafakemalpa, sa stream inflow. In addition, the present nutrient status, compared with previous years' data (1986 - 1990), collected only during summer months, showed that the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake have changed according to former years. The former and recent years' data also showed that the fluctuation of the water depth also influenced the chemical composition of the lake water. According to qualitative and quantitative observations, the effects of human impact and current status of the lake were determined. The physical and chemical characteristics of the lake water have changed according to human activities and nutrient loadings. Although external nutrient loadings are important because of the inflow of pollutants, internal nutrient loadings are the major factors that determined the trophic status of the lake. In the light of all findings, the lake balance is going to be disturbed, and some measures must be taken to prevent these circumstances.

J	Naranjo, JA; Hevia, F; Polanco, E				Naranjo, Jose Antonio; Hevia, Francisco; Polanco, Edmundo			Mondaca Volcano lahar of December 3, 1762, Maule Region (35°28'S): one of the largest volcanic disasters in Chilean history	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												The Mondaca Volcano comprises a thick rhyolitic lava-field and a dome of similar composition, located near the Lontue River Valley headwaters in the northern part of the Southern Andes Volcanic Zone. It reaches a total volume of similar to 0.85 km(3), and it is formed by 4 subunits, named Mondaca 1, 2, 3 and 4, which correspond to successive rhyolitic blocky lava flows, emitted from a rounded dome structure. They present well-preserved flow structures and, in the surroundings, restricted to the south and east of the dome, pyroclastic fall, as well as block and ash deposits are also exhibited. Downstream, along the Lontue River, a laharic deposit is recognized. The lahar was produced after the collapse of an ephemeral similar to 0.44 km(3) lake generated after the river obstruction by viscous lavas, during the 1762 first eruptive phase. Proximal lahar facies are well exposed between 5 and 30 km from their source. The profuse agricultural activity has completely obliterated the lahar's medium facies deposits along the Central Depression, but are well identified at the mouth of the Mataquito River, 180 km downstream, as a beige-coloured layer, interbedded within dark coastal beach-sands. The identification of overflows and super-elevation deposits formed during the debris flow emplacement along the Lontue River valley, allows to determine a high flow mobility, with estimated velocities that locally reached up to 114 km/h. Petrographic characteristics in addition to chemical composition of lavas from the volcano, pyroclasts and juvenile blocks of the laharic deposit, indicate that all they correspond to high K calcoalkaline rhyolites with subalkaline affinity. These backgrounds, together with the geographical continuity between the lavas and debris deposits along the Lontue and Mataquito rivers, verify facies correlation and common origin as the result of the 1762 Mondaca Volcano eruption complex evolution. Although it was a mainly effusive eruption that could not be observed from Curico, the collateral consequences would have been catastrophic over a vast area to the south of that city, and evidences one of the largest volcanic disasters in Chilean history. Probably because of the low density polulation at that time, the consequences could have been minor.					; Hevia Cruz, Francisco/KXR-2888-2024	Polanco Valenzuela, Edmundo/0000-0003-4138-8235; Hevia-Cruz, Francisco/0000-0003-1041-5579													0718-7106					SEP	2021	48	3					514	528		10.5027/andgeoV48n3-3361	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV48n3-3361													WOS:000753897800002

Over the past several centuries developments have concentrated in localized centers that we call cities and metropolises. Population in some of these centers continues to grow exponentially and the need to meet the infrastructure improvement demands of the ever increasing population poses the engineering community with major challenges. These challenges include the preservation of our historic legacy and the protection of the environment that would be impacted by these improvements. In many cases the only alternative to achieve this goal is to promote extensive utilization of underground space technology. Las Vegas located in Clark County, Nevada is one of the cities in USA that continues to grow at a very rapid rate and is faced with the challenge of developing a sustainable water supply. Based on published literature, Clark County had less than 500, 000 residents in 19 70 but is projected to grow to over two million by the end of 2007. With rapid increase in population the demand for water has grown substantially in the Greater Las Vegas Valley. Southern Nevada obtains 90% of its water supply from Lake Mead. The Lake is fed by the Colorado River Basin and is located in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The water source is located in an environmentally sensitive area. The Colorado River Basin has experienced worst droughts in its recorded history and has significantly impacted water storage in Lake Mead. The water levels in the Lake are projected to fall more than 100 feet. In order to overcome the severe drought challenges for developing a sustainable water supply the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) has utilized underground space technology concepts. Water is directed from the Lake through a system of "Lake Intakes" connected by a network of underground pipelines and tunnels. Based on projected continued drought conditions, the capability of the existing intakes to sustain the water demands may be compromised. As such, SNWA has undertaken the construction of a new deeper intake project. This paper provides an overview of the new project that implements underground space utilization for a sustainable water supply.																					978-960-254-666-6				2007							125	+																WOS:000265078600019

Shahinur; Lima, Rabina Akther; Ali, Azhar; Mahmud, Yahia			Biometric indices of eight fish species from the catchment area of Kaptai lake, Bangladesh	ECOLOGICAL FRONTIERS												Biometric indices viz. i) Length-weight relationships (LWRs), ii) form factor (a(0.3)) and iii) condition factors (relative K-R and Fulton's K-F) were presented for 8 fish species collected from Kaptai lake at five sampling points including Rangamati Sadar, Barkal, Naniarchar, Langadu and Kaptai upazila. A total of 3204 individuals belonging to 3 families were measured and weighed between August 2020 to April 2021 by the catch assessment survey with different types of fishing gear (seine net, current net, gill net and lift net). Calculations were made for the parameters a and b of the eq. W = aTL(b). The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed significant differences between stations in LWRs for all species (P < 0.01). The parameter b of the LWRs ranged from 2.34 (Parambassis lala) to 3.34 (Ailia coila) with a mean value of 2.98 (SE: 0.11) and 50% of its fall within the interval 2.9-3.2. Results showed that 3 species showed positive allometric growth (Gonialosa manminna, Ailia coila, and Eutropiichthys vacha), 3 showed negative allometric growth (Gudusia chapra, Chanda baculis, and Parambassis lala), and 2 exhibited isometric growth (Corica soborna, Chanda nama). The findings further indicated that the LWRs of 8 species were highly correlated (r(2) > 0.90, P < 0.001). The a(3.0) value estimated for eight species varied from 0.0043 to 0.0114. The K-R value ranged from 0.26 to 4.97 and K-F value ranged from 0.17 to 2.89; showed significant differences of K-R and K-F between stations for eight species. As per FishBase, a new record for the maximum size of C. soborna and C. baculis was documented as 7.1 cm and 8.1 cm, respectively. This research is the first to provide information on biometric indices for six species (C. soborna, C. nama, C. baculis, P. lala, A. coila and E. vacha) in Kaptai Lake, which may aid in management and conservation throughout the country, including their geographical distribution.

J	Hinrichsen, RA				Hinrichsen, Richard A.			Predicting the effects of currents on the adaptive movement of juvenile salmonids	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Background: Anadromous salmonids present a marvellous opportunity to study animal movement, with some juveniles in the Yukon and Amur rivers travelling more than 2000 km from their natal areas to the ocean. During their freshwater residence, juvenile salmonids, regardless of river of origin or migration distance, balance the pressures of feeding, predator avoidance, and migration to survive. Questions: What are the choices of current and swimming velocities that stream-dwelling juvenile salmonids use to optimize lifetime reproductive success? How are these influenced by maximum current velocity in the stream or river that they inhabit? Mathematical methods: I developed a dynamic optimality model that treats current and swimming velocities as decision variables. The state variables are downstream river location and fish size. I solve the optimality model using optimal control theory and apply it to juvenile ocean-type Chinook salmon in the Hanford Reach, Columbia River, Washington. Results: Five fundamental behaviours or movement phases result from the optimality model: rapid upstream migration, appetitive ('foraging') upstream movement, station holding, appetitive downstream movement, and rapid downstream migration. These fundamental behaviours were not specified a priori, but emerge when optimizing lifetime reproductive success over the full range of possible behaviours. The appetitive and station holding behaviours are broadly characterized as foraging/ predator avoidance. Rapid migration is favoured over foraging/predator avoidance whenever the magnitude of the marginal value of displacement exceeds the marginal predation risk of displacement. If, during foraging/predator avoidance, the maximum current velocity rises above the swimming spil that maximizes growth, station holding is optimal; otherwise, appetitive movement, which carries greater predation risk, might be optimal. The two types of downstream movement predicted by the optimality model (appetitive movement and rapid downstream migration) describe the movements of the 'ocean-type' and 'stream-type' races of Chinook salmon populations of the Columbia River. In the Hanford Reach application, optimal movements begin with station holding, then switch to downstream appetitive movement or rapid downstream migration, depending on the maximum current velocity. Juveniles accelerate as they migrate downstream. I describe an experiment to test the influence of current velocity on foraging behaviour and a field study to characterize juvenile upstream migrations.																			1522-0613	1937-3791				NOV	2019	20	6					569	596																WOS:000894405500001

The final phase of the intake excavation consisted of a plug blast to break the channel through into Stave Lake. The plug consisted of a rock and till wall topped with a fill cofferdam, about 51m wide and between 8 and 12m high. Total rock volume was approximately 2600m(3), overlaid with about 4600m(3) of This paper describes the methodology and practical techniques used in planning and loading the blast, and the precautions taken to protect the new and existing structures and equipment. Blasting of the plug by the normal method using downholes would have required the placing of extra fill and much drilling through casing, so the contractor made the decision to drill horizontal holes from the dry, downstream side. Because of poor rock conditions, all 183 holes had to be drilled oversize at 3.5" dia. and fitted with 2.5" i.d. plastic pipes to keep them open. Hole lengths ranged from 2.5 to 18m, with a pattern of 1.5m spacing and 1.0m burden (with the holes slightly fanned vertically). Because of significant water exposure, a film-packaged emulsion explosive was used, placed using a pneumatic cartridge loader for maximum borehole compaction. The powder factor averaged 1.3kg/m(3) (2.2lbs/yd(3) rock only). An initiation system of combination surface/downhole delay shocktube units was employed, with double and triple redundancy. The maximum number of holes firing in any 8ms window was limited to three (to minimize vibration), while the whole sequence was fully activated before the first hole fired. All shocktube connections were secured and covered over at the foot of the rockface before flooding the excavation downstream of the plug prior to the shot. To protect the powerhouse gates from hydraulic shock, all hole collars were grouted and an air curtain was provided. The blast was completely successful. A maximum vertical displacement of 6m was recorded, but no flyrock was evident. Readings for peak overpressure and vibration were well below the allowed limits. Mucking proved to be easy, with fine fragmentation, full pull, and no tights.																									2000							109	121																WOS:000087294300010

Stromatolites and Their "Kin" as Living Microbialites in Contemporary Settings Linked to a Long Fossil Record	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Organo-sedimentary deposits that result from fine-grained sediment trapping, binding, and likely precipitation (of carbonate) by microbes in flat-mat, branching, and dome-shaped constructions are termed microbialites. They were first identified as stromatolites by paleontologists well before the discovery of cyanobacteria that build the same kinds of structures in contemporary settings around the world. Earth's earliest life forms were prokaryotes (bacteria and bacteria-like forms) that reproduced under anaerobic conditions and later produced increasingly aerobic conditions. Stromatolites persisted through later Archean and Proterozoic times through the subsequent Phanerozoic to the present. At the start of the Cambrian Period 538 million years ago, stromatolites continued alongside rapidly diversifying plant and animal phyla during the Cambrian explosion of eukaryotic life, which have complex cells with internal structures and tissue-grade organization in multicellular taxa. The type locality exhibiting clear examples of stromatolite structures is conserved at Lester Park near Saratoga Springs in northeastern New York State. Paleontologist James Hall (1811-1898) was the first in 1884 to assign a Latin binomen (Cryptozoon proliferum) to stromatolite fossils from Lester Park. Thereafter, reports on formally named stromatolites proliferated, as did examples from virtually all subsequent geological time intervals including the Pleistocene Epoch. However, recognition that living cyanobacteria formed stromatolites identified as Cryptozoon took place much later in 1961 with the announcement by geologist Brian W. Logan (1933-2008) who described modern constructions in Hamlin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia. Initially, Shark Bay was regarded as a one-of-a-kind sanctuary for stromatolites living under restricted conditions with elevated levels of salinity that prohibited competition or grazing by eukaryotes. Most notably, among other settings with living stromatolites discovered and described since then are the Bahamas, East African rift lakes, Mexico's Baja California, and saline lakes in Argentina. This report reviews the history of discoveries of modern-day stromatolites, more commonly called microbialites by biologists. All are predicated on the ground-breaking efforts of geologists and paleontologists who first described fossil stromatolites but were unaware of their living counterparts. The Lester Park locality is highlighted together with a master list of other North American localities that feature purported Cryptozoons.

Active fault segments as potential earthquake sources: Inferences from integrated geophysical mapping of the Magadi fault system, southern Kenya Rift	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Southern Kenya Rift has been known as a region of high geodynamic activity expressed by recent volcanism, geothermal activity and high rate of seismicity. The active faults that host these activities have not been investigated to determine their subsurface geometry, faulting intensity and constituents (fluids, sediments) for proper characterization of tectonic rift extension. Two different models of extension direction (E-W to ESE-WNW and NW-SE) have been proposed. However, they were based on limited field data and lacked subsurface investigations. In this research, we delineated active fault zones from ASTER image draped on ASTER DEM, together with relocated earthquakes. Subsequently, we combined field geologic mapping, electrical resistivity, ground magnetic traverses and aeromagnetic data to investigate the subsurface character of the active faults. Our results from structural studies identified four fault sets of different age and deformational styles, namely: normal N-S: dextral NW-SE; strike slip ENE-WSW; and sinistral NE-SW. The previous studies did not recognize the existence of the sinistral oblique slip NE-SW trending faults which were created under an E-W extension to counterbalance the NW-SE faults. The E-W extension has also been confirmed from focal mechanism solutions of the swarm earthquakes, which are located where all the four fault sets intersect. Our findings therefore, bridge the existing gap in opinion on neo-tectonic extension of the rift suggested by the earlier authors. Our results from resistivity survey show that the southern faults are in filled with fluid (0.05 and 0.2 Omega m), whereas fault zones to the north contain high resistivity (55-75 Omega m) material. The ground magnetic survey results have revealed faulting activity within active fault zones that do not contain fluids. In addition, the 2D inversion of the four aero-magnetic profiles (209 km long) revealed: major vertical to sub vertical faults (dipping 75-85 east or west); an uplifted, heavily fractured and deformed basin to the north (highly disturbed magnetic signatures) characteristic of on going active rifting; and a refined architecture of the asymmetry graben to the south with an intrarift horst, whose western graben is 4 km deep and eastern graben is much deeper (9 km), with a zone of significant break in magnetic signatures at that depth, interpreted as source of the hot springs south of Lake Magadi (a location confirmed near surface by ground magnetic and resistivity data sets). The magnetic sources to the north are shallow at 15 km depth compared to 22 km to the south. The loss of magnetism to the north is probably due to increased heat as a result of magmatic intrusion supporting active rifting model. Conclusively, the integrated approach employed in this research confirms that fault system delineated to the north is actively deforming under E-W normal extension and is a potential earthquake source probably related to magmatic intrusion, while the presence of fluids within the south fault zone reduce intensity of faulting activity and explains lack of earthquakes in a continental rift setting.

C	Ridgway, MS; Shuter, BJ; Middel, TA; Gross, ML		Philipp, DP; Ridgway, MS		Ridgway, MS; Shuter, BJ; Middel, TA; Gross, ML			Spatial ecology and density-dependent processes in smallmouth bass: The juvenile transition hypothesis	BLACK BASS: ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Black Bass 2000 Symposium	AUG 21-24, 2000	ST LOUIS, MO	Amer Fisheries Soc, Bass Pro Shops, In Fisherman				Previous research from our long-term study of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu ecology in Lake Opeongo revealed a negative density-dependent relationship between the number of adult males in the population that appeared mature and the number of males nesting in any given year. The availability of nesting habitat is not the limiting resource behind this observation. We present three lines of evidence to argue that the process of forming an adult home range is the key factor in determining what fish join the breeding population. First, the dispersal of age-0 fish from their nest site is limited in their first summer and, assuming that this reflects the location of age-1 juveniles, indicates that juveniles can be located relatively close to their nest of origin. Second, juvenile growth is density-dependent with the strength of this relationship increasing during the mid-juvenile period (ages 2, 3, and 4) and weakening at the end of the juvenile period (ages 5 and 6). Third, adult home ranges are large (200-400 ha), traveled extensively each day (1-9 km), established quickly after reproduction, rarely incorporate the nest site and overlap in location from one year to the next. The home range analysis of adults and dispersal of age-0 juveniles provides evidence of a strong spatial structure in smallmouth bass populations. We propose that density-dependent growth during the mid- to late juvenile period reflects a process of movement away from the natal area to locations where adult home ranges will be established. We further propose that this movement is a density-dependent process based on competitive abilities of individuals and possibly reflects social foraging that is observed to increase in juvenile bass after their first year. The spatial spread of juveniles presumably leads to adults establishing home ranges in various locations in the lake and, based on our observations of their behavior and fidelity in the home range, points to a spatial learning process that may be functioning to locate home ranges at the end of the juvenile period. The 95 percent kernel home range is larger for females than for males indicating that there may be differences between males and females operating within this spatial spread process. Acquiring a home range and successfully foraging in what may be social groups of adults and sub-adults may be a prerequisite for maturation and nesting. In conditions of high population abundance, activity necessary for successful foraging and establishment of home ranges may consume larger proportions of assimilated energy as a result of competition and this in turn could slow the maturation process leading to our earlier observation of a density-dependent relationship between adult abundance and the numbers of nesting males. This is the juvenile transition hypothesis.					; Shuter, Brian/A-3991-2008	Middel, Trevor/0000-0002-8390-1220; 													0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						47	60																WOS:000180817600004

Dacian Basin, opened after tectonic movements, badenian, in the Sarmatian, outside the Carpathian arch, has evolved in a brackish sedimentation environment by the end of the Pliocene, after which was installed a lacustrine environment amid of water body restriction only in the southern part of Romania. The lacustrine system is installed in Quaternary amid climate cooling and morphological changes of the surrounding region and sedimentation basin. Basin silting was originally produced from the Carpathian chain, from north and from the Moesian platform south of Danube, which was in emerged position. Lacustrine sedimentation dominates in this phase of the material transported by river systems in the Carpathians and the southern frame of sedimentary basin. In a later phase, the conditions of sedimentation are diverse amid of dramatic global climate changes and dacic lake system withdrawal to the east. Closure of the western part of the Moesian Platform determined lake system migration eastward from the Middle Pleistocene, and in the closing phase (the Holocene), to north-eastern Romanian Plain. Under these conditions Quaternary succession is complete only in the Romanian Plain to the east of the Arges river, where it reaches considerable thickness, above. 400 m. The lower limit of the Quaternary agreed to 1.8 Ma, since 1948, was confirmed by studying marine sediments from Vrica point (1985), and located approx. 4 km south of the peninsula of Calabria (Italy). Since 2009 the question of changing this limit based on studies made at Monte San Nicola in southern Sicily, to 2.558 Ma, which coincides with the Gauss-Matuyama magnetic reversal and Calabrian - Piacenzian limit, which is also the limit to the Pliocene. New chronostratigraphical scale of the Quaternary fits much better climatic conditions for the submission of the Romanian Plain sedimentary sequences and can clarify the position of geomorphological subunits. For example, the lower Quaternary was placed in the final sequence of the Candesti strata. After the new geochronological scale this sequence falls completely in Lower Quaternary and corresponds to the evolution realities of the dacic lake system in the Romanian Plain.					frinculeasa, madalina/C-2660-2012														1314-2704						2011							69	76																WOS:000307366000009

Holocene climate on the Modoc Plateau, northern California, USA: the view from Medicine Lake	PALAEOLIMNOLOGICAL PROXIES AS TOOLS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION IN FRESH WATER	Developments in Hydrobiology											Medicine Lake is a small (165 ha), relatively shallow (average 7.3 m), intermediate elevation (2,036 m) lake located within the summit caldera of Medicine Lake volcano, Siskiyou County, California, USA. Sediment cores and high-resolution bathymetric and seismic reflection data were collected from the lake during the fall of 1999 and 2000. Sediments were analyzed for diatoms, pollen, density, grain size (sand/mud ratio), total organic carbon (TOC), and microscale fabric analysis. Using both C-14 (AMS) dating and tephrochronology, the basal sediments were estimated to have been deposited about 11,400 cal year BP, thus yielding an estimated average sedimentation rate of about 20.66 cm/1,000 year. The lowermost part of the core (11,400-10,300 cal year BP) contains the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. From about 11,000-5,500 cal year BP, Medicine Lake consisted of two small, steep-sided lakes or one lake with two steep-sided basins connected by a shallow shelf. During this time, both the pollen (Abies/Artemisia ratio) and the diatom (Cyclotella/Navicula ratio) evidences indicate that the effective moisture increased, leading to a deeper lake. Over the past 5,500 years, the pollen record shows that effective moisture continued to increase, and the diatom record indicates fluctuations in the lake level. The change in the lake level pattern from one of the increasing depths prior to about 6,000 cal year BP to one of the variable depths may be related to changes in the morphology of the Medicine Lake caldera associated with the movement of magma and the eruption of the Medicine Lake Glass Flow about 5,120 cal year BP. These changes in basin morphology caused Medicine Lake to flood the shallow shelf which surrounds the deeper part of the lake. During this period, the Cyclotella/Navicula ratio and the percent abundance of Isoetes vary, suggesting that the level of the lake fluctuated, resulting in changes in the shelf area available for colonization by benthic diatoms and Isoetes. These fluctuations are not typical of the small number of low-elevation Holocene lake records in the region, and probably reflect the hydrologic conditions unique to Medicine Lake.

They can be (1) indices of anthropogenic influence upon abiotic and biotic natural components; (2) causative agents of "water blooms" in coastal ponds, saline lakes, estuaries and contact zones between fresh and saline or brackish waters and (3) producers of toxic and biologically active substances. Last time there are many evidences of intensive distribution and mass propagation of cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, M. pulverea, Aphanizornenon flos-aquae, Oscillatoria planktonica, Atzabaena spiroides, etc.) in the Black Sea coastal region and Ukrainian waters. We propose several perspective ways for the overcoming of "water blooms" and using of cyanobacteria in agriculture and medicine for the control of harmful organisms. The deterrent, antibacterial, fungicidal, antihelminthic, insecticidal and rodenticidal characteristics of metabolites of some mass and widespread cyanobacterial species and strains and their natural associations (in particular, M. aeruginosa and its antagonists or competitors) form their basis. Now these organisms exist out of human activity. Meanwhile they can be a source of new selective and prophylactic preparations biological pesticides and antimicrobial agents. In this light we provide the progress in several ways of creation of new cyanobacterial preparations for pest control (important findings in this field are based on experimental material): (1) using of the natural cyanobacterial material by withdrawal of surplus biomass; (2) application of controlled methods of continuous cultivation; antibacterial activity of M. aeruginosa pure culture to some conditionally pathogenic microorganisms depending on the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and terpene fraction in the medium was ascertained. (3) creation of enclosed systems of sewage utilization in cattle-breeding complexes as a nutrient substratum for cultivation of active cyanobacterial species. (4) complex cyclic utilization of cyanobacterial biomass in technology of production of forage protein concentrate from natural populations of M. aeruginosa: salvage - using of waste materials as the natural pesticides for herbivorous insects (Colorado potato beetle, fall webworm and lackey moth): our results displayed high deterrent, growth inhibition and insecticidal (intestinal and contact) activity of waste material. The analysis of these findings demonstrates that using of cyanobacteria for agricultural and medical biocidal preparations is very promising and perspective way and has a great potential in the sphere of biological pest control.																					978-9944-0871-0-0				2007							937	946																WOS:000288477700087

Assessment of metal contamination in an urban drainage system (using water and tilapia, Oreochromis spp.) in view of human health effect. A case study of some selected communities in Cape Coast township in Ghana	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY												This research work aimed at studying the metal content of water and tilapia fish sample, Oreochromis spp., from a wastewater-fed pond around the University of Cape Coast community using instrumental neutron activation analysis. The metals studied were Al, As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, V and Zn. In the water samples the order of elemental concentrations at sampling point 1, in mu g/g, was K (75.96 +/- A 0.92), Na (18.52 +/- A 0.35), Al (6.00 +/- A 0.89), Mn (3.28 +/- A 0.44), As (3.08 +/- A 0.40), Mg (1.56 +/- A 0.17), Ca (0.70 +/- A 0.08), Cu (0.54 +/- A 0.08) and V (0.04 +/- A 0.01). Co, Cr, Fe and Zn were below detection limits of INAA. The order of elemental concentrations in the water at point 2 was as follows: Na (4.99 +/- A 0.14), K (4.82 +/- A 0.89), Mn (4.40 +/- A 0.53), Mg (2.92 +/- A 0.37), Al (1.98 +/- A 0.21), As (0.69 +/- A 0.10), Ca (0.24 +/- A 0.07) and V (0.23 +/- A 0.06) with Co, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn falling below the detection limit of INAA. The concentrations recorded for Al, As, Cu and Mn in the water samples were all above WHO permissible limits. The mean levels of heavy metals in the soft tissue of tilapia was of the order: K > Mg > Fe > Ca > Na > Al > Mn > Zn > V > Cu > Cr > Co. Arsenic was below detection limit. The transfer factor values calculated for the metals Al, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, Na and V were all greater than one indicating movement of metals from the water column to the tilapia species. The hazard index (HI) calculated for Al, Fe, Mn and V suggested possible occurrence of adverse health effects (HI > 1) where as the HI value obtained for Cr, Cu and Zn (i.e., HI < 1) suggested unlikely adverse effects occurring.					; Appenteng, Michael/GPF-9009-2022	Appenteng, Michael/0000-0001-9331-7397; KANTANKA SARFO, DANIEL/0000-0001-8611-1323													0236-5731					SEP	2012	293	3					807	814		10.1007/s10967-012-1750-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-012-1750-x													WOS:000307405800013

The units are separated by thin, laterally extensive sheets of terrigenous carbonaceous mudstones, which have been subjected to organic petrographic and geochemical studies. The mudstones are thermally immature, with maturities corresponding to R-0, in the range 0.35-0.50%. The mudstones contain very high proportions of allochthonous inertinite, subordinate huminite, char and negligible proportions of liptinite. Inertinite reflectance distributions are markedly bimodal, with maxima at approximately 1.73 and 4.91% R-m. Both pyrolysis yields and solvent extract yields are low. The distributions of n-alkanes are markedly light-end skewed and show a pronounced predominance of even-numbered compounds in the lower carbon number range. Biomarker-distributions feature a dominance of C-29-steranes, slight enhancement of extended hopanes and alpha beta beta-steranes, low proportion of tricyclic triterpanes and very low hopane/sterane ratios. Sedimentological, organic petrographical and geochemical evidence suggests that the regular alternation between marine and terrestrial depositional environments during deposition of the Jakobsstigen Formation was related to low-amplitude, high-frequency changes in relative sea-level and local climate. The mudstones were deposited during early rise of relative sea-level in shallow, flat-bottomed lakes or lagoons on a broad coastal plain The lakes acted as traps for fine elastic sediment and for predominantly windborne inertinite, generated by wildfires in the hinterland. High rates of evaporation rendered the lakes mildly saline, hampering their colonization by vegetation other than cyanobacteria and halophilic microorganisms. Similarly, saline porewaters excluded. higher plant vegetation from emergent areas. Upon continued rise of the relative sea-level, the lakes were gradually flooded and their deposits became covered by sandy shallow marine sediments. The larger areas covered by shallow marine waters during-periods of high relative sea-levelled to a more humid local climate and to lower frequency of wildfires. During falling relative sea-level, the marine deposits were eroded and partially removed and the cycle subsequently repeated upon renewed rise in relative sea-level. Hence, minor changes in relative sea-level gave rise to the regular alternation of two vastly different depositional environments, as well as to marked variations in local climate.

The high concentrations of chloride salts, sulfates, and alkali metal ions in these areas can induce alkali-silica reactions (ASRs) in concrete. These reactions generate harmful gel within the concrete, causing expansion and cracking, which significantly impacts the durability of concrete structures. This study investigates the evolution of the mechanical properties in high-performance concrete (HPC) under long-term ASR by incorporating different admixtures and varying the equivalent alkali content. A three-dimensional random aggregate mesoscopic model was used to simulate static compression tests under various operational conditions. Non-destructive testing methods were utilized to determine the expansion rate, internal, and surface damage variables of the concrete. The experimental results indicate that the 10-year expansion rate differs from the 1-year rate by approximately 1%, and under long-term ASR mitigation measures, the internal damage in the HPC is minimal, though the surface damage is more severe. As the equivalent alkali content increases, the compressive strength of the concrete cubes decreases, initially rising before falling by 5-15% over time. The HPC with only air-entraining agent added exhibited better mechanical performance than the HPC with both air-entraining and corrosion inhibitors added, with the poorest performance observed in the HPC with only a corrosion inhibitor. A relationship was established between the surface and internal damage variables, with the surface damage initially increasing rapidly before stabilizing as the internal damage rose. Numerical simulations effectively describe the damage behavior of HPC under static uniaxial compression. Comparisons with actual failure morphologies revealed that, in the cube compression tests, crack propagation directly penetrated both coarse and fine aggregates rather than circumventing them. The simulations closely matched the experimental outcomes, demonstrating their accuracy in modeling experiments. This study discusses the compressive mechanical properties of concrete under prolonged ASR through a combination of experimental and simulation approaches. It also delves into the impact of surface damage on the overall mechanical performance and failure modes of concrete. The findings provide experimental and simulation support for the concrete structures in regions with high alkali contents.

Reticulitermes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) in Arizona:: Multiple cuticular hydrocarbon phenotypes indicate additional taxa	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Current taxonomic and biogeographical information on Reticulitermes in the United States suggests the only species found in Arizona is Reticulitennes tibialis Banks. Reticulitermes occurs naturally throughout Arizona with the exception of much of the Sonoran and Colorado deserts. Collections of Reticulitermes from disparate locations in Arizona and neighboring states were made to characterize their cuticular hydrocarbons for taxonomic purposes. We identified five phenotypes based on cuticular hydrocarbon mixtures of worker termites. The predominant hydrocarbons in AZ-A have 25 and 27 carbons in the parent chain, including 5,17-dimeC27. The late-eluting compounds are composed primarily of dienes, trienes, a homologous series of internally branched mono- and dimethylalkanes, and 5,17-dimethylalkanes. AZ-B differs from AZ-A by lacking the late-eluting dienes and trienes and by producing smaller amounts of hydrocarbons with 27 carbons in the parent chain. The cuticular hydrocarbons in AZ-C are composed primarily of olefins; C29:1 is the most abundant, and, with C27:1, C31:2, and C33:2, predominates the hydrocarbon mixture. This phenotype also has a homologous series of 5,17-dimethylalkanes from C27 to C43. AZ-D is distinguished by the absence of any 5-methylalkanes, 5,17-dimethylalkanes, or late-eluting dienes or trienes. The hydrocarbon mixture of AZ-D most closely resembles that of Reticulitennes hesperus Banks from northern California. NM-A can be distinguished from the other phenotypes by the significant amounts of the hydrocarbons coeluting in two peaks: C27 + C27:3 and 7-, 9-, 11-, 13-meC27 + C27:2. AZ-A was not common; the few samples we collected were all at the higher elevations, from 2,000 to 2,250 m, in northern Arizona. AZ-B was the most common and was found throughout the state from Fairbank (approximate to 1,300m) to Jacob Lake (approximate to 2,600 m). This phenotype also was found in eastern Nevada and southern Utah. AZ-C was sympatric with AZ-B over most of the distribution of the latter regions but was elevationally allopatric in southern Arizona. AZ-C occurred at high elevations (> 1,500 m) on the desert islands of southeastern Arizona, such as the Santa Catalina, Santa Rita, Chiricalma, and Pinaleno mountains, whereas AZ-B occurred at lower elevations (< 1,250 m), usually associated with a riparian area. AZ-D was collected only once in northern Arizona near Jacob Lake, AZ (approximate to 1,800 m) but also on Mt. Charleston in southern Nevada. NM-A was collected near jemez Springs and Chaco Canyon, NM, as well as in the vicinity of Moab, UT. Additional data from morphology, behavior and/or DNA may confirm that these phenotypes represent distinct species as it has with California Reticuliternies.																			0013-8746					MAR	2007	100	2					206	221		10.1603/0013-8746(2007)100[206:RIRIAM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2007)100[206:RIRIAM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000244762800012

The analysis of ecological carrying capacity change and the study of influencing factors in the basin is conducive to protecting the ecology of the basin and maintaining the sustainable development of the social economy. Ecological carrying capacity is an important indicator for the quantitative assessment of regional sustainable development, and the assessment of regional ecological carrying capacity based on grid scale can more accurately and vividly reflect the regional sustainable status and provide reference for regional coordinated development. With the support of GIS technology, based on the unique ecosystem characteristics of the river basin itself, the research method of quantifying the ecological carrying capacity from the three perspectives of ecological function elasticity, resource and environmental capacity and socio-economic coordination was carried out, and a relatively complete comprehensive evaluation index system of ecological carrying capacity was constructed. The ecological carrying capacity of the five major lake basins of Qilu Lake and Yangzonghai from 2000 to 2018 was evaluated, and the temporal and spatial changes and driving mechanisms of ecological carrying capacity were analyzed. The results show that: (1) The FLBOCYP has an overall moderate ecological carrying capacity (average of similar to 0.5). The temporal trend in ecological carrying capacity was an initial rise followed by a fall, but there was an overall increasing trend at a rate of 0.019. (2) Areas with a strong ecological carrying capacity were mainly distributed in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions outside of the lake area, whereas areas of weaker ecological carrying capacity were mainly distributed in the plain area around the lake. The ecological carrying capacity gradually increased from the area around the lake to the periphery. (3) At a basin scale, the ecological carrying capacities of the Dian, Fuxian, and Yangzong lake basins were relatively high, whereas those of the Xingyun and Qilu lake basins were relatively low. The greatest increase in ecological carrying capacity of Fuxian Lake has occurred since 2000. (4) The spatial pattern of ecological carrying capacity showed clear agglomeration. This agglomeration has been continuously enhanced but remained relatively stable over the past 19 years. The main agglomeration modes were identified as "high-high" (HH), "low-low" (LL), and "not obvious agglomeration". (5) Among the many driving factors, ecological elasticity, biological abundance index, proportion of forest land, and degree of human disturbance showed the greatest explanatory power for spatial differentiation of ecological carrying capacity, and the interaction of any two factors affected the spatial analysis of ecological carrying capacity even more. In summary, the overall ecological environment of the FLBOCYP has experienced significant improvement since 2000, whereas that of the plain area has deteriorated more seriously in recent years.

Sediment OM is largely protected from aerobic mineralization under water saturated conditions but are vulnerable when exposed to oxygen during periods of drought. As climate change progresses, drought periods are likely to occur more frequently and may affect OM mineralization, and thus the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from pond ecosystems. Therefore, we aimed to test how GHG emissions and concentrations in the sediment respond to drought by gradually decreasing water levels to below the sediment surface. To this end, undisturbed sediment cores from two small ponds with distinct watershed and water chemistry characteristics were incubated in mesocosms for 118 days at 20 degrees C. Water levels were sequentially tested at 3 cm above the sediment surface (Phase I) and at the level of the sediment surface (Phase II). In Phase III, water levels were continuously lowered either by evaporation or by active drainage including evaporation. Mean CH4 fluxes of both ponds were high (21 and 87 mmol m-2 d-1), contributing 90 and 96% to the GHG budget over the three phases. The highest CH4 fluxes occurred in Phase II, while active drainage strongly reduced CH4 fluxes in Phase III. A multivariate analysis suggests that dissolved organic carbon and sulphate were important drivers of CH4 fluxes in Phase III. CO2 and N2O fluxes also responded to declining water levels, but their contribution to the GHG budget was rather small. Both gases were primarily produced in the upper sediment layer as indicated by highest concentrations at 5 cm sediment depth. Compaction of sediment cores by water level lowering increased bulk density and maintained high water contents. This side effect, retarding the drying of the sediment surface, was possibly relevant for the GHG net emission of the sediments in Phase II and III. Overall, GHG fluxes from the sediments exhibited high sensitivity to falling water levels. This study suggests that drying pond sediments have great potential to emit large amounts of GHGs to the atmosphere in the event of drought, representing hot spots of GHGs in the landscape.

"ostrov") (Ostrovul Mare, Papadia, Calnovat, Baloiu and Ostrovul Pasarilor) and a 4 - 13 kmwide floodplain on the left handside, which before dyking and draining had encompassed numerous lakes. In this sector, the lefthandside tributaries of the Danube in Romania - the Jiu, Olt and the Arges, are bigger than in Serbia and Bulgaria, but they are more numerous (Timok, Ogosta, Iskar, Vit, Osam, Iantra and Lom). A second hydro power station was built at Ostrovul Mare in cooperation with Serbia. A famous rail bridge between Fetesti and Cernavoda was built by Anghel Saligny in the years 1890 - 1895. It was the longest bridge across the Danube, and the eighth in the world at that time. A second road-and-rail bridge, parallel to it, was commissioned in 1987. A road-and-rail bridge (commissioned in 1954) spans the river between Giurgiu (Romania) and Ruse (Bulgaria). In this sector was built in 2015, a new bridge for vehicle traffic between Calafat (Romania) and Vidin (Bulgaria). The floodplain of the Lower Danube (Pontic Sector) between Gruia and Tulcea, comprised numerous lakes, marshlands with reed and rush as well as softwood floodplain forests usually occurring as galleries on natural levees and frequent flooding, the local population was suggestively named "balta". The,balta", serves as a habitat for numerous plant and animal species the development of which is closely related to the water. The closely interrelation between Danube and floodplain (Balta), as well as the natural processes occurring within floodplain accomplish significant hydrological, biogeochemical and ecological functions and comprise a number of natural resources and values that are of great use to the local population. The relationship between Danube and Balta has been largely interrupted beginning with 1960 year, when a large areas were cut by dams, drained and transformed into agricultural polders. The consequence of these measures was a not the loss of broad floodplain areas (4400 km(2)), it also implied the manifold natural services/functions of this area, as spawning for fish, filter for pollutants et al.																			2285-7923						2018							1	9																WOS:000669647100001

After river regulation, the habitat types for fish changed towards a warm-water fish environment with high temperature, high nutrient content and reasonable macrophyte stands. Accordingly, the fish species and biomasses changed in the direction of backwater fish compositions. Currently, 22 fish species are recorded. In the early 1990ies, the macrophyte stands collapsed and heavy blooms of algae and cyanobacteria produced very instable habitat conditions, particularly in summer, close to oxygen depletion, and fish kills. A main nutrient source for algal growth, phosphorus, was removed from the water column by an Iron-III-Chloride treatment, and the fish community responded by consuming food particles from benthic and surface areas instead of the missing plankton. Despite these ecosystem changes, no increased mortality in the fish community was observed during this period. With the intention of keeping high transparency in the water column, a bio-manipulation experiment was introduced by increasing predators via stocking to reduce plankton feeding Bleak. The species Asp was the most effective predator (consuming up to 5.8 individuals of bleak/day), followed by Pike and Pike-Perch. The water transparency -expressed as Secchi depth -increased by up to 15 centimeters in the experimental area 'Kaiserwasser', compared to the control sections. Most of the fish species occurring in the Alte Donau are connected to macrophyte stands, at least in some stages of their life span. Denser water plant communities (expressed in CKI -Cumulative Kohler Index) are not only preferred as habitats by young of the year-class fishes, fish larvae and foragers, but are also used as spawning grounds. There is a clear correlation between the density of plants and fish in the horizontal distribution across the water body of the Alte Donau. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of fish was also associated with plant stock density. Management of macrophytes is done regularly through mowing activities and plant harvesting. It is important to note that young fish should have the opportunity to escape from a dense macrophyte canopy before the plant biomass is removed from the water column. Small boats with mowing bars and separated macrophyte harvesting devices exert clearly less pressure on accidentally removed individuals out of the living habitat (31.3 kg of harvested macrophytes with 1 removed fish - immediate convey belt harvesting after mowing remove 1 fish every 2.1 kg).

A Two-Column Model Parameterization for Subgrid Surface Heterogeneity Driven Circulations	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												Earth system models currently struggle to account for the complex effects that land surface heterogeneity can have on land-atmosphere interactions. There have been attempts to include the impact of this heterogeneity on the atmosphere, but they ignore the development of coherent circulations that can be driven by spatial differential surface heating. A wealth of literature, particularly large-eddy simulation (LES) based studies, shows that these circulations have significant impacts on the development and organization of clouds. In this work, we describe a two-column model with a parameterized circulation driven by atmospheric virtual potential temperature profiles, differences in near surface temperature between the two columns, patterns of surface heterogeneity, and the mean background wind. Key aspects of the proposed model structure are compared with LES output, and the model is then implemented between two otherwise independent single column models. While some avenues for improvement exist, when the circulations are parameterized, we see increased cloud development and realistic changes to the mean profiles of temperature and moisture. The proposed model qualitatively matches expectations from the literature and LES, and points to the potential success of its future implementation in coarse grid models. This work addresses the challenge of incorporating land surface heterogeneity into earth system models to better understand land-atmosphere interactions. Current models struggle to account for the complex effects of subgrid land surface heterogeneity on these interactions, especially when a warmer region near a cooler region can cause a circulation to occur. The study proposes a two-column model that includes a parameterized circulation driven by vertical temperature profiles, surface temperature differences, surface heterogeneity patterns, and the background wind. The model is compared to high resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) output for 3 days in the Southern Great Plains. The results show that the model qualitatively reproduces patterns observed in LES and the existing literature, primarily that cloud production increases and concentrates over warmer surface areas. The model's success suggests its potential implementation in coarse grid models to explore regional and global atmospheric impacts of subgrid land surface heterogeneity. Additionally, the similarities between land surface heterogeneity circulations and other thermally driven circulations indicate potential applicability in subgrid-scale parameterization of sea and lake breezes. While limitations and opportunities for improvement exist, overall this work represents a promising step toward understanding the impacts of subgrid heterogeneity on cloud production and atmospheric processes in earth system models. A parameterized circulation between two otherwise independent columns is described and evaluated for three simulation days Large-eddy simulations (LES) show substantial agreement with the overall circulation model structure proposed When implemented, the parameterized circulation yields similar changes in the atmospheric profiles and cloud production to LES					Fowler, Megan/ABE-2060-2020; Chaney, Nathaniel/AAR-2944-2020; Fowler, Megan/I-4313-2015; Bragg, Andrew/K-6099-2015; Dirmeyer, Paul/B-6553-2016; Chaney, Nathaniel/L-9110-2015	Fowler, Megan/0000-0002-7668-9655; Simon, Jason/0000-0002-5111-2147; Hay-Chapman, Finley/0000-0002-4161-8494; Dirmeyer, Paul/0000-0003-3158-1752; Waterman, Tyler/0000-0002-9181-3810; Chaney, Nathaniel/0000-0001-7120-1713														1942-2466				MAY	2024	16	5							e2023MS003936	10.1029/2023MS003936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023MS003936													WOS:001264026600001

In 4 collections of A. Aquaticus on Elodea in a lake (Windermere), c. [circa] 20% of the specimens contained in their guts fragments of green Elodea leaves; this material and pieces of oak (Quercus) were identified from characteristic leaf hairs. Some specimens had also eaten the filamentous alga Oedogonium. Fluorescence microscopy is a useful aid for screening invertebrates that may have eaten living plant tissues. Immature A. aquaticus, with an initial mean body length of c. 3 mm, wet weight c. 1 mg, were grown through sexual maturity over a 49 day period at 15.degree. C in a series of 22 experiments (6-12 isolated specimens in each experiment) comparing growth rates on different foods, including instances where no food was given. Animals were fed on a variety of items collected from the littoral of Windermere [England, UK], plus some laboratory cultures of algae and bacteria. The highest mean specific growth rate (5.8%/day) was obtained on young Elodea leaves mechanically shaken to remove epiphytes. Other diets yielding fast growth rates (3.7 -5.3%/day) were young growing leaves of Elodea with few epiphytes and older green and brown living leaves covered with a thick growth of epiphytic algae, epiphytic algae removed from Elodea, plastic imitation Elodea immersed in the lake until covered with attached algae, epilithic algae on stones, Oedogonium and decaying oak leaves. Slower growth (1.3-2.2%/day) and poorer survival was obtained on the following: a pure culture of the bacterium Sphaerotilus natans; cultured bacteria from lakewater; the filamentous algae Cladophora and Stigeoclonium both with and without epiphytes; fecal matter from Asellus; freshly killed Asellus; lake sediment. Some growth (mean = 0.7%/day) and 50% survival for 21 days occurred in starved animals kept in filtered, sterilized lakewater. Better survival and slightly faster growth (1.0-1.5%/day) occurred in starved animals kept in filtered and unfiltered lakewater. Growth of A. aquaticus was experimentally determined from birth in animals fed on young green Elodea leaves and on decaying oak leaves. On both diets, growth was curvilinear and approximately exponential from birth to sexual maturity reached at c. 2 mg wet wt in 46-60 days at 15.degree. C. In older specimens the relative growth rate gradually fell over a period of 50 days, representing a more linear phase of growth during sexual maturity.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	6					505	+		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01473.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01473.x													WOS:A1978GD70500001

However, identifying fresh, juvenile pyroclasts in tephra fall deposits can be challenging and inconclusive. We studied the products of explosions at Poas Volcano, Costa Rica, in 2016-2019, a period during which the volcano transitioned from a pressurized, hydrothermally sealed state to an open conduit with increased degassing to the atmosphere. The activity consisted of semi-continuous explosions producing < 500-m-high plumes, with the exception of explosions on April 14 and 22, 2017, that produced 4-km-high plumes. We analyzed the grain size distribution, componentry, and particle density of the products of twenty explosions, and collected groundmass glass composition on juvenile particles for three of them. Our work demonstrates varying degrees of magma involvement with the hydrothermal system through time, with juvenile material representing a wide range of abundance (similar to 10-70 vol.%) in deposits of individual explosions. Before early April 2017, we infer that small phreatomagmatic explosions were triggered by contact between magmatic fluids and/or magma and the hydrothermal system, based on the presence of abundant hydrothermal fragments and minor juvenile magma. Concurrent with decreasing hydrothermal component in the deposits, explosions in April-May 2017 eroded the walls of the shallow plumbing system, evidenced by an increase in wall-rock lithics in the deposits. These changes coincided with drying of the crater lake, leading to several magmatic explosions in April-September 2017, whose juvenile-rich deposits are consistent with primary fragmentation of fresh magma in the conduit. The eruptive activity changed after this magmatic phase, and in 2019, small explosions mostly recycled the heterogeneous deposits of previous events, producing fine material with high proportions of recycled particles. All explosions from 2016 to 2019 remobilized already-emplaced magma from the 1953-1955 eruptive period, although distinct glass compositions between explosions suggest difference in crystallization or they tapped different portions of this magma body. Our work sheds light on the eruption dynamics and shallow plumbing system of this persistently active volcano and provides a case study for understanding the variable efficiency of phreatomagmatic fragmentation.

J	de la Durantaye, K				de la Durantaye, Katharina			OF SHIPS AND STORMS, AND DAMAGED DOCKS: THE DOCTRINE OF PRIVATE NECESSITY IN GERMAN AND U.S. LAW	RABELS ZEITSCHRIFT FUR AUSLANDISCHES UND INTERNATIONALES PRIVATRECHT												The German Civil Code (Burgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB) contains an explicit privilege for private necessity: The owner of a thing may not prevent others from damaging or destroying his property in order to avert actual danger if the threatened harm is unreasonably greater than the damage to the owner's property ( 904 sentence 1 BGB). He may, however, claim compensation for any damages he incurred ( 904 sentence 2 BGB). However, the Code does not state who is liable to the owner. If the person who damaged or destroyed the owner's property did not do so to preserve his own legal interest but the interests of someone else, it is unclear whether liability should fall on the actor or on the third person. Over the past century, courts and commentators have tried to find a principled solution to this problem. Doing so has proven difficult - the owner's claim under 904 sentence 2 BGB is an exception in German private law. Usually, a person is liable to another only if he or she has done something wrong. In a case of private necessity, however, 904 sentence 1 BGB allows the property to be sacrificed. In the United States, the doctrine of private necessity was first established in 1910 in Vincent v. Lake Erie. Until today, the case has been a staple of tort law classes throughout the country, and it has puzzled law professors and legal philosophers alike. Most agree that the case was rightly decided. There is, however, considerable disagreement as to why this is the case. Some but not all of the arguments resemble those brought forward in the discussion surrounding 904 sentence 2 BGB. The article examines both the debates in Germany and in the United States, including historical arguments advanced on either side of the Atlantic. It shows that some of the theories which feature prominently in the United States could serve to enrich the discussion in Germany. This is true even though American scholars pay very little attention to the question of who should be liable to the owner. Indeed, the Restatement (Second) of Torts holds a different person liable than the Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, a fact which so far has received little attention.																			0033-7250	1868-7059				JAN	2014	78	1					71	108		10.1628/003372514X676169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1628/003372514X676169													WOS:000422437100003
J	Rennes, A				Rennes, Aleksi			LAW AND IMAGE: THE MINOR ETHICS IN KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI'S DECALOGUE ONE	CINEMA-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE MOVING IMAGE												The narrative of Decalogue One, the first episode of Krzysztof Kieslowski's television series The Decalogue (Dekalog, 1988), revolves around a rationally unexplainable accident: a child falls through the ice of a frozen lake and drowns, even though his father has ensured with scientific calculations and empirical experiments that the ice should support the child's weight with ease. The series' references to the Ten Commandments suggest the tentative explanation that the child's death is a judgement of God on the father, who has transgressed by elevating human reason above God. This article argues that the possibility of divine judgement is invoked in Decalogue One only in order to question the logic of judgement in general as well as the idea of universal moral law on which such judgements depend. In this way, Kieslowski's film is able to bypass the moral code determined by the Ten Commandments and proceed to develop an alternative, cinematic ethics in and of the image. The aim of the article is to locate Kieslowski's ethico-aesthetic practice within the "minor" tradition of ethical thought as developed by Gilles Deleuze in his reading of the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. Deleuze upholds a sharp distinction between morality and ethics. For him, morality, with its emphasis on transcendent values, laws, and obedience, represents a misinterpretation of the true nature of reality. Ethics, on the other hand, is concerned with the rectification of such a misconception. It is defined as an epistemic operation of overcoming the natural and habitual conditions of human perception which prevent the attainment of adequate knowledge of the world. Similarly, in Decalogue One, ethical practice can be seen as belonging primarily to the domain of perception and knowledge: the characters constitute a typology of different modes of vision attempting to grasp the central mysterious event of the film. In addition, this article claims that the shift from religious morality to minor ethics in Kieslowski's film brings about a renegotiation of the concept of death as it is wrested away from moral considerations concerning guilt and judgement. Instead, death becomes a site for experimentation with the capacities of the cinematic image itself. It becomes a phenomenon of arrested movement which always also involves the potential for reanimation, for life regained.																			1647-8991						2019	11						61	+																WOS:000513942400004

Increasing health equity through active green interventions: parkrun participants' motivators, preferences and well-being benefits	PEOPLE AND NATURE												If equitable greenspace interventions are to be designed and delivered to motivate wider urban publics to experience the life-enhancing benefits of physical activity, it is essential to understand what motivates people to practise physical activity in nature, the perceived benefits and which greenspace characteristics are most preferred by whom, including deprived, inactive populations. These gaps were investigated in collaboration with parkrun, a not-for-profit organisation offering free, weekly, timed 5-km runs or walks in public settings. Post parkrun questionnaires (n = 246) were conducted with participants at three UK events across a range of park settings with contrasting public health profiles: (i) Urban new town (Stevenage: socio-cultural and health profiles close to England benchmark); (ii) Inner London (Barking: ethnically diverse, economically deprived, inactive); and (iii) Rural Lakeland (Fell Foot: low ethnic diversity, income deprivation, healthier than benchmark). Overall, physical fitness was the dominant initial motivator for parkrun participation (n = 93%). Fresh air and scenery (+28%, p < 0.001); Social reasons (+25%, p < 0.001); Volunteering (+21%, p < 0.001) and Stress relief (+13%, p = 0.004) all increased significantly from initial to ongoing motivating factors. These increases were all greater for women than men. 'Social reasons' increased from initial to ongoing motivator in all settings including the deprived inner London setting (+30%, p < 0.001) where participants valued parkrun for its inclusivity. Participants expressed strong preferences for natural over built settings for physical activity, with greenspace and alongside water most preferred. Microscale preferences for lakesides and views, related birds and wildlife and woodland settings were identified. Synthesis and applications. These findings indicate that women and people in deprived, ethnically diverse settings might have most to gain from the holistic health benefits of exercising in nature, and parkrun as an active green health intervention. This has potentially transformative implications for addressing health inequalities in the United Kingdom and more widely. Public health professionals might develop further active green interventions, increasing equitable access to outdoor natural settings among populations most in need. Governments and green infrastructure planners might prioritise funding and delivering parks and greenspaces. Landscape designers might incorporate waterside and woodland settings to optimise their active benefits.																				2575-8314				OCT	2025	7	10					2375	2392		10.1002/pan3.70118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pan3.70118		AUG 2025											WOS:001556177800001

Rapid identification of back-flow in three distributaries of Jingjiang Reach middle Yangtze River, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Unusual back-flow events occurred in 2015 and 2017 at the near-mainstream ends of the three distributaries of the Jingjiang Reach, middle Yangtze River, China. It is presently challenging to precisely quantify back-flow discharges at river distributary ends where normal-flow discharges are measured chronically. This problem is more complicated at the ends of the three Jingjiang distributaries, each of which is more than 100 km long, and thus favors the generation of different back-flow forms. We use empirical formulae based on the Saint-Venant Equation and the Fall Index Method to quantify impacts on flow discharges at the two ends of each distributary of three key hydrodynamic variables: (1) water discharge at Zhicheng hydrological station, (2) total discharge from the four southwest tributary rivers, and (3) water levels at the two ends of the distributaries. We use the variable control approach to identify the contribution ratios of natural and human driving factors to flow discharges at the two ends of the distributaries during five historical stages. The empirical formulae provide reasonable results, with high values of correlation coefficients (R-2 = 0.84 similar to 0.98) obtained, demonstrating that the total water discharge from the four southwest tributary rivers is negligible. These formulae perform well in reproducing observed flow discharges at the two ends of the distributaries, especially the maximum discharges and cumulative volumes for normal-flow and back-flow events. Three charts are devised for different flow conditions at the two ends, from which back-flow events can be rapidly identified. Before impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), riverbed adjustment caused by the lower Jingjiang Cutoff Projects and the Gezhou Dam contributed the most to flow discharge changes (>= 50 %) at the near-mainstream ends of the distributaries. Afterwards, precipitation dominated (>60 %). In the future, back-flow events are expected only to occur at Mituosi (i.e., Taipingkou) and Nanxian hydrological stations, for which optimal reservoir operation and water resource utilization could remedy the back-flow crisis. Use of climate models and more advanced technologies such as remote sensing and GIS are recommended to enhance the reliability of predictions.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2024	641								131778	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131778		AUG 2024											WOS:001294020900001

Great Lakes Water Levels: Decomposing Time Series for Attribution	ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE AND ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS												Great Lakes water levels have been trending downwards throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries. Potential causes are numerous. There have been dredging and water diversion projects over the last 110 years, increasing demand for fresh water consumption from a rising population, and considerable variations in environmental factors (rainfall, snowfall, air temperature, and wind), all causal in nature. A thorough assessment of the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis Project (RP) archives of time series of winds, air temperatures, rainfall and snowfall, and water level data, reveals that falling lake levels can be linked to rising air temperatures. Nonuniform, post-glacial, isostatic adjustments of the entire Great Lakes region has further complicated the system as land mass tilting causes localized uplift or subsidence that has also altered relative water levels. A mathematical decomposition of the various data sets and accessory calculations strongly indicate regional atmospheric temperature increases over the entire 20th century and the early 21st century resulting in increased evaporation, appears to be the dominant driving factor in the continued downward trend of water levels in the Great Lakes. Moreover, a high degree of correlation was discovered in comparing water level in the Great Lakes with the comparable temporal variability and record length trends evident both the Global (Land and Ocean) Surface Temperature Anomaly (GSTA) time series and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (the AMO). It is of note that there have been several water level events since 2013 from which the long term losses of fresh water have undergone a change and the lakes have gained fresh water. This presents an apparent quandary to our nearly 120 year, record length study which revealed downward trends in water levels. To wit, this recent upward movement begs the question: Is the two-year change a precursor to increases in water levels or is it just a local blip? We will focus on data up to 2013, but comment upon recently reported increases as part of our analyses.

Understanding the sources and input fluxes of DIC in karst reservoirs is crucial for regional carbon cycle studies. This study utilized dual carbon isotopes (delta C-13(DIC) and Delta C-14(DIC)) to estimate the contribution rates and input fluxes of DIC from various sources in Aha Reservoir (AHR), located in southwestern China. Our results indicated that the DIC concentrations (22.33-32.79 mg L-1) and delta C-13(DIC) values (-10.02 parts per thousand to -8.55 parts per thousand) were nearly homogeneous both vertically and laterally in the reservoir (p > 0.05). The Delta C-14(DIC) values (-246.31 parts per thousand to -137.86 parts per thousand) were homogeneous along the vertical profile (p > 0.05), but showed significant horizontal variation (p < 0.05), with values decreasing from -149.57 +/- 10.27 parts per thousand to -232.85 +/- 2.37 parts per thousand at the mouths of the inflowing rivers. We found that the inflowing rivers were the primary DIC sources to AHR, contributing 70% of the total input, while groundwater and atmospheric CO2 contributions were relatively minor, at 18% and 12%, respectively. The Jinzhong River (JZR), influenced by industrial and domestic wastewater discharge, contributed the largest DIC input flux at 2.01 t/(km(2)<middle dot>mon). In contrast, the Youyu River (YYR), influenced by acidic mine drainage, and the Baiyan River (BYR), influenced by agricultural activities, contributed relatively smaller DIC input fluxes of 1.29 t/(km(2)<middle dot>mon) and 1.03 t/(km(2)<middle dot>mon), respectively. This study highlights the significant impact of anthropogenic activities on DIC input in AHR, with industrial and domestic wastewater discharges having a greater influence than agricultural activities and acidic mine wastewater inputs. These findings underscore the critical need to manage and mitigate the impacts of human activities on karst reservoir ecosystems.

J	Djelita, B; Benadda, L				Djelita, Belkheir; Benadda, Lotfi			Spatiotemporal Assessment of the Water Quality of the Hammam Boughrara Dam (North-West Algeria)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In this study, which contains a database covering the period from January 2008 to December 2010, on the water level of the Hammam Bougrara dam located in a semi-arid zone with moderate winter (western Algeria), we focused specifically on the mechanisms of eutrophication as well as the spatial and temporal variation of the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the reservoir. The diagnosis revealed high concentrations of certain elements such as P, PO4, NO3, NO2, NH4, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, HCO3- and SO4-2, which characterizes highly mineralized waters with conductivities between 1100 and 1800 S/cm, therefore polluted and selenitic. These waters are rich in nutrients, such as phosphorus and with a slightly alkaline pH (between 7.1 and 9.1) favor the proliferation of organisms such as Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Diatomophyceeswhich together account 93 57% of the population of algae. This proliferation causes a decrease in transparency and dissolved oxygen which are also signs of eutrophication. This study will adopt a better methodological approach to reduce the number of stations and increase the sampling rate, for a thorough understanding of limnology operation of the dam to ensure its protection. Despite the very high phosphorus inlakes during those years, the symptoms of eutrophication in the reservoir (chlorophyll a.) They are far from achieving the expected levels of extreme loads on the flow-replies Vollenweider. This could be explained by the fact that, upon his arrival for restraint, ortho-phosphate is quickly rendered inaccessible due to algae efficient flocculation means of fine clay particles and a formation hydroxyapatite followed by precipitation. Consequently, one can conclude that it would be necessary to develop and deepen our knowledge of limnology of lakes and reservoirs in temperate climates, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, in order to embed processes in these lakes a general model describing the relationship load-response, similar to that of Vollenweider. The results could help set specific objectives to reduce phosphorus inputs depending on the intended use of the waters and allow better management of water quality in terms of trophic response and in the context of sustainable development and decision support.																			2299-8993					DEC	2021	22	11					92	103		10.12911/22998993/143272	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/143272													WOS:000871916100011

In the heated area the prevalence of infection of the retinal form, D. baeri, was always 100%, whereas in the unheated site there was an increase from 93% in May to 100% in June 1986. The relative density of D. baeri was found to increase gradually during the first summer in both areas, although the accumulation rate of metacercariae was significantly increased in the heated area. In August of the first year the relative density of D. baeri peaked in the heated areas, whereas it continued to increase in the unheated control. However, in September of the following year, the relative densities were at the smae level in both thermal regimes. A concomitant decline in the degree of overdispersion of metacercariae within the host population was observed in the heated area as the population density of metacercariae decreased, whereas the index of dispersion remained at the same level throughout the study in the unheated area. However, it was not possible to sample perch in the unheated area between October 1986 and May 1987 and changes in the parasite population have occurred during this period. The prevalence and relative density of D. spathaceum, the lens form, was on the contrary low, especially in the unheated site where it was recorded only occasionally. The infection of D. baeri exhibited a convex pattern in both thermal regimes, although the peak infection was noticed earlier in the heated area. Regulation of the parasite infrapopulation may have been achieved by the combined effects of a decreased transmission rate of cercariae with increasing age of the host, the mortality of metacercariae as a natural termination of the life span and to selective predation of heavily infected hosts. However, regardless of an increased accumulation rate of metacercariae in the heated area, the relative densities of D. baeri became equal in both thermal regimes at the end of the study. The mortality rate of metacercariae in the heated area was therefore presumably increased as compared with the unheated reference site.

J	Plotnikova, OM; Sharov, AV				Plotnikova, O. M.; Sharov, A., V			Mouse-modeled change in the toxicity of manganese(II) ions when using activated carbons	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The content of manganese ions (Mn2+) in the rivers and lakes of the Kurgan region (Russia) is 3-6 mg/L in average, reaching 10 mg/L and more in winter, which is significantly higher than the permissible concentrations. The article presents the results of studying the effect of Mn2+ ions on the blood biochemical parameters of three generations of laboratory mice after drinking solutions containing Mn2+ ions (20 mg/L). In mice of the first generation, an increase in the products of lipid peroxidation (LPO) by 1.4 times was observed while the activity of aminotransferases decreased by 20-30% and carbonyl protein products by 15-25%; in the 3rd generation, Mn2+ -induced protein oxidation increased, as the aldehyde and keto derivatives increased 1.4 and 1.7 times respectively, aerobic processes of glycolysis were activated, which was accompanied by a decrease in lactate and glucose and an increase in urea. Thus, with the long-term influence of manganese ions, a change in the energy balance in mice towards aerobic processes was noted, and the wave-like effect of Mn2+ ions with chronic exposure was observed - the effect in the first and third generations is more intense than in second. To purify water from excess Mn2+ ions in order to use it for drinking purposes, the possibility of using activated carbons (AC) from waste wood of weeping birch, widely distributed in the Kurgan region, was evaluated. These coals are characterized by high adsorption activity with the amount of Mn2+ on the surface of the AU 0.60 mmol/g. Blood parameters were studied after oral introduction of filtrates of aqueous extracts from AC with adsorbed Mn2+ (AC-Mn) ions to mice. Water filtrates from AU-Mn increased in mice the activity of aminotransferases and activated the oxidative modification of proteins and, to a greater extent, LPO. Thus, the resulting activated carbons, due to their high adsorption activity to manganese(II) ions, but due to the increasing aerobic activity due to oxygen sorption on them, they can be recommended for the purification of water for cultural and household purposes and for technical use.																			1995-4301	2618-8406					2021		1					188	193		10.25750/1995-4301-2021-1-188-193	http://dx.doi.org/10.25750/1995-4301-2021-1-188-193													WOS:000632219100025
J	Ricci, C; Ponti, L; Pires, A				Ricci, C; Ponti, L; Pires, A			Migratory flight and pre-diapause feeding of Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera) adults in agricultural and mountain ecosystems of Central Italy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					9th International Symposium on Ecology of Aphidophaga	SEP, 2004	Ceske Budejovice, CZECH REPUBLIC	Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Univ S Bohemia, Biol Fac				The research on pre-diapause feeding of C. septempunctata L. adults was carried out from 1998 to 2002 in the Tiber Valley, in the Botanical Garden of Perugia University, and in the Sibillini Mountains National Park (Central Italy). The species reproduces in spring feeding mostly on aphids infesting Graminaceae. In the second half of June, newly emerged adults have various migratory behaviours. Some of them remain in the valley while some leave the cereals and fly to other crops, where they feed both on 15 aphid species (e.g., Aphis gossypii Glov. on melon, Aphis fabae Scop. on sugarbeet), and also on pollens of wild plants such as Carduus nutans L., and fungi spores. However, most of the adults migrate to mountain pastures to find different food sources. During this migration, strong south-western storms often force the ladybirds to shelter in urban habitats. When the sunny weather returns again, due to the mistral (north-western wind), the adults continue the flight in swarms to mountain areas. In 1999, on Mt. Vettore (2478 in) we witnessed a "shower" of ladybirds, some of which hid in the turf. When reaching high altitude locations still covered with snow (Lake Pilato, 1940 in, on Mt. Vettore), the adults, exhausted by the long flight, usually remain motionless on the snow. Due to the warming of the sun they sink to a depth of 5-6 cm, so that they remain trapped in the frozen snow during the night. At this site C. septempunctata was found together with Vibidia duodecimguttata (Poda) and Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). We investigated the gut content of adults from this location. After aggregation, the hungry adults disperse to flowering plants at lower elevations where they feed on 8 aphid species (e.g. broom aphid) and pollens of several plants (e.g., Laserpitium garganicum Tem., Centaurea rupestris L., Cachrys ferulacea L. The first mating was observed on broom. At "Pian Grande" location, adults were found in crop fields (lentil, mustard) and wild pastures (cornflower, gentian) mating and feeding on aphids, pollens, nectar and fungal spores. Haymaking forces ladybirds to move towards higher locations in search of food. Echinops ritro L., Eryngium amethystinum L., Carlina acaulis L., Cirsium eriophorum (L.), Galium verum L. and Euphorbia cyparissias L. were major food sources at 1800 in altitude. Gut content of C. septempunctata adults showed that pre-diapause diet consisted of aphids, pollen of Compositae and Umbelliferae, and spores of fungi (e.g., Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp.). There was no statistical difference between the number of adults containing remains of aphids, fungal spores, and pollens. We found four significant correlations between the different food sources observed. In August some adults stopped feeding and in diapause condition sheltered under stones and among leaves or seed capsules of plants where they had fed. Others migrated to nearby woods and aggregated between juniper needles.

J	Claessen, HJM				Claessen, Henri J. M.			On Early States - Structure, Development, and Fall	SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY												After some remarks on early theorists of the state a survey is presented of recent views on the state. As a point of departure is taken Radcliffe-Brown's statement that the state is 'a collection of individual social beings connected by a complex system of relations'. Following this view the state will be considered here as a specific type of sociopolitical organization. After discussing its three basic components (number of people, territory, and type of government) several types of state are distinguished of which the first type, the Early State is the subject of the article. On the basis of extensive comparisons general characteristics of the Early State are established, and with the help of these three types of Early States are constructed, the inchoate (incipient), the typical and the transitional one. In all cases Early States are governed by a sacred ruler, whose legitimacy is based on a kind of (asymmetrical) reciprocity between ruler and people. This makes legitimacy and ideology central issues in Early State studies. The Early State evolves generally from simpler types of sociopolitical organization, such as e.g., chiefdoms or large bigmen systems. To make this evolution possible a complex interplay of a number of factors is needed, varying from population growth, the production of a surplus and an ideology which explains and justifies the increasing division of power. Moreover some incentive seems necessary to trigger the developments. Interestingly stratification as well as the development of more complex types of sociopolitical organization sometimes occurs quite unnoticed and unintended as examples from Lake Victoria, the Kachin, and the Betsileo demonstrate. It seems possible to analyze the evolution of sociopolitical organization with the help of the Complex Interaction Model in which the various factors mentioned play a role. War is considered here as being a derivative of problems in the factors mentioned, rather than a necessary or sufficient factor. There are reasons to think of specific regional features in the development of Early States. The evolution of Early States in Africa involved features differing from those in Polynesia or the Americas. These differences were found mainly in the ideological sphere. The Early State is no more. Some declined and collapsed because of internal weaknesses; others were subjected by the Great Powers when colonizing the world in the 17th till the 19th centuries and some Early States reached the level of Developed, and even of Mature States in the course of time by themselves. The dominant position of the State in the present world should not blind us for the fact that all over the world still numerous people live in tribal organizations, irrespective of the fact of whether they are still independent or incorporated into some state. On the other hand, there are nowadays several states that can be considered as Failed States, not able to run their own business. Other states are now members of ever and ever growing international organizations. The question is thus justified in the end: has the State still a future?																			1681-4363					MAR	2010	9	1					3	51																WOS:000213520200001
J	Gill, D; Jagannathan, K; Fujisaki-Manome, A; Field, V; Channell, K; Lemos, MC				Gill, Devin; Jagannathan, Kripa; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Field, Victoria; Channell, Kimberly; Lemos, Maria Carmen			Linking Boundary Organizations to Coproduce Actionable Knowledge: A Case Study of Ice Forecasting for Great Lakes Navigation	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Navigating the Great Lakes during icy conditions poses significant safety challenges for the shipping sector. Available ice information is uncertain and fragmented, and navigators must seek out multiple sources for information at the spatial and temporal scales they require, if the information is available at all. Navigators have expressed that they require more highly localized and easily usable information for current and predicted ice conditions to support decision-making. In this study, we seek to meet this information need by applying a boundary organization chain (BOC) approach to facilitate the coproduction of an actionable short-term Great Lakes ice forecast. We focus on two main aspects of this research: 1) producing an actionable decision-support product that meets the needs of Great Lakes ice navigators and 2) contributing to the knowledge coproduction scholarship on BOCs by providing a detailed account of our methods to create a BOC and coproduce an actionable ice forecast. Our results support incorporating existing communities of practice (COPs) into BOCs to enhance the coproduction of actionable knowledge, specifically through increasing their complementarity and embeddedness. COPs are informal networks of users that meet voluntarily to share knowledge and develop professional skills, which we found naturally builds the coproduction capacities of participants (e.g., embeddedness and complementarity). We also find that COP members are well positioned to disseminate coproduced knowledge across wider user groups. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study, we identified critical gaps in available ice information to support Great Lakes winter navigation, including predictions of current ice concentration and thickness at localized spatial scales and predicted ice movement. We coproduced an ice forecast with a format that is accessible and usable for navigators, while increasing crew and vessel safety by enabling more informed decisions regarding where and when to travel. We also contributed to theoretical understanding of how boundary organization chains work in context to coproduce actionable knowledge. This is a burgeoning area of research with a small number of empirical studies. By expanding both its thematic breadth (e.g., ice forecasting) and methodological approach (an in-depth account of our engagement efforts), we believe we critically contribute to the existing literature.					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021; Gill, Devin/HNC-5303-2023; Jagannathan, Kripa/X-6897-2019	Jagannathan, Kripa/0000-0003-4584-8358; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; 													1948-8327	1948-8335				OCT	2024	16	4					711	721		10.1175/WCAS-D-24-0012.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-24-0012.1													WOS:001433410600001
J	Tsyrenzhapov, SV; Gurulev, AA				Tsyrenzhapov, S., V; Gurulev, A. A.			Thermal deformations and brightness temperature of the ice cover of freshwater bodies	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The paper presents results of experimental studies of the deformation of a freshwater ice cover. The works were carried out on the Lake Arakhley located in the Trans-Baikal Region, where winters are characterized by small amount of snow and sharp daily changes in the air temperature reaching 25 degrees C. As a result of this, the temperature gradient of the surface layer of the ice cover exceeds 1 degrees C/cm. This causes formation of the dry cracks in the upper layers of the cover. The authors measured daily variations in the temperature of the ice cover at various depths by its thickness. Results of the experiment made possible to propose the explanation for the formation of dry cracks and the depth of them, which reaches 20 cm in the Trans-Baikal Region. According to studies using a differential strain gauge, it was found that the upper layer of the ice cover is in a stressed state due to changes in its temperature. This is evident from the fact that when the temperature of the upper layer of ice changes, the distance between the reference points slightly changes too. When the air temperature approaches the temperature of the "ice-water" phase transition, the ice cover is unloaded. We assume that the dry cracks can also be formed when the stress state of ice is released at even lower temperatures. Interest in these structural changes had been arisen in connection with possible variations in the electromagnetic properties of the ice cover, which can be detected by non-contact radio wave measurements. These variations result from the presence of a quasi-liquid layer on the surfaces of dry cracks (together with hoar-frost and snow in them), which can exist down to a temperature of -90 degrees C. Its presence increases the complex relative permittivity of a medium consisting of a solid (ice) and a liquid phase (water film). Calculations of the radiometric temperature within the centimeter range in a flat-layer non-isothermal medium have shown that the presence of dry cracks in the ice cover increases radio temperature up to 5 K on both, vertical and horizontal polarizations. This value is recorded during radiometric measurements, and this factor should be taken into account during the remote sensing of freshwater ice covers.

Excellent outcrop and the discovery of economic diamondiferous kimberlite pipes in the centre of the craton during the early 1990s have led to an unparalleled amount of geoscientific information becoming available. Over the last 5 years deep-probing electromagnetic surveys were conducted on the Slave, using the natural-source magnetotelluric (MT) technique, as part of a variety of programs to study the craton and determine its regional-scale electrical structure. Two of the four types of surveys involved novel MT data acquisition; one through frozen lakes along ice roads during winter, and the second using ocean-bottom MT instrumentation deployed from float planes. The primary initial objective of the MT surveys was to determine the geometry of the topography of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) across the Slave craton. However, the MT responses revealed, completely serendipitously, a remarkable anomaly in electrical conductivity in the SCLM of the central Slave craton. This Central Slave Mantle Conductor (CSMC) anomaly is modelled as a localized region of low resistivity (10-15 Omega m) beginning at depths of similar to 80-120 km and striking NE-SW Where precisely located, it is spatially coincident with the Eocene-aged kimberlite field in the central part of the craton (the so-called "Corridor of Hope"), and also with a geochemically defined ultra-depleted harzburgitic layer interpreted as oceanic or arc-related lithosphere emplaced during early tectonism. The CSMC lies wholly within the NE-SW striking central zone defined by Grutter et al. [Grutter, H.S., Apter, D.B., Kong, J., 1999. Crust-mantle coupling; evidence from mantle-derived xenocrystic garnets. Contributed paper at: The 7th International Kimberlite Conference Proceeding, J.B. Dawson Volume, 1, 307-313] on the basis of garnet geochemistry (G10 vs. G9) populations. Deep-probing MT data from the lake bottom instruments infer that the conductor has a total depth-integrated conductivity (conductance) of the order of 2000 Siemens, which, given an internal resistivity of 10-15 Omega m, implies a thickness of 20-30 km. Below the CSMC the electrical resistivity of the lithosphere increases by a factor of 3-5 to values of around 50 Omega m. This change occurs at depths consistent with the graphite-diamond transition, which is taken as consistent with a carbon interpretation for the CSMC. Preliminary three-dimensional MT modelling supports the NE-SW striking geometry for the conductor, and also suggests a NW dip. This geometry is taken as implying that the tectonic processes that emplaced this geophysical - geochemical body are likely related to the subduction of a craton of unknown provenance from the SE (present-day coordinates) during 2630-2620 Ma. It suggests that the lithospheric stacking model of Helmstaedt and Schulze [Helmstaedt, H.H., Schulze, D.J., 1989.

J	Donaldson, GM; Shutt, JL; Hunter, P				Donaldson, GM; Shutt, JL; Hunter, P			Organochlorine contamination in bald eagle eggs and nestlings from the Canadian great lakes	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Unhatched eggs and plasma samples from prefledged bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) from a recovering population in the Canadian Great Lakes Basin were contaminated with organochlorine compounds at levels comparable to those reported for eagle populations in several areas of the United States. PCBs were among the most commonly detected contaminants and occurred at high concentrations in plasma. Plasma PCB concentrations in Lake Erie nestlings were significantly higher than in chicks from Lake Nipigon (0.130 and 0.047 mg/kg wet weight, respectively). Blood levels of mirex were higher in nestlings from Lake Superior compared to those from Lake Erie (0.0012 and 0.0006 mg/kg wet weight, respectively). Migration routes and over-winter locations of avian prey that constitute a part of the bald eagle chick's diet are likely to contribute to these spatial contaminant patterns in plasma. Atmospheric deposition and a cold condensation effect for chlordane compounds may have produced higher levels of these compounds in plasma samples from Lake Superior compared to samples from Lake Erie (0.020 and 0.008 mg/kg wet weight, respectively). Levels of DDE in plasma were generally low, ranging in concentration from 0.02 mg/kg wet weight for lakes Erie and Nipigon to 0.06 mg/kg wet weight for Lake Huron. Concentrations of organochlorines in eaglet plasma remained relatively stable between 1990 and 1996; no significant trends associated with year of sampling were detected. The data from Lake Erie showed no correlation between productivity and plasma levels of PCBs or DDE during this time period. There were no indications that the concentrations of contaminants detected were adversely affecting productivity in Canadian Great Lakes bald eagle populations. Residue levels in eggs from Lake Erie eagle territories were equally or more contaminated than eggs from other highly contaminated environments in the United States such as the Great Lakes and Columbia River estuary. Concentrations of DDE and PCBs in Lake Erie eggs declined significantly between 1974 and 1994. Although dieldrin and chlordane levels showed a similar decline, these relationships were not statistically significant. Mirex concentrations were relatively stable. Eggs from Lake of the Woods were significantly less contaminated than those from Lake Erie (PCBs: 3 and 84 mg/kg wet weight, respectively; DDE: 3 and 24 mg/kg wet weight, respectively). Reproductive success (number of young produced/active nest) remained constant between 1982 and 1996 and productivity is sufficient to maintain an increasing population. The number of active nests has increased during this period indicating that the population is expanding and might be expected to do so until suitable habitat becomes limiting. Reductions in organochlorine levels, reintroduction efforts, immigration from other populations, and changes in habitat quality have likely contributed to the observed growth in the number of breeding pairs.																			0090-4341					JAN	1999	36	1					70	80		10.1007/s002449900444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900444								9828264					WOS:000077443500010

Areas under nature protection, particularly national parks, also fall into this category and make an important contribution to nature conservation. They are also the basis for the development of ecotourism, as in other parts of the world. Russia, along with other countries, adheres to a variety of concepts and tools for the development of ecotourism in PAs. In this paper, we examine the essential characteristics and implementation domains of state policy for promoting ecotourism development, using the Zabaikalsky National Park (ZNP) and the Tunkinsky National Park (TNP) as illustrative examples. Both parks are situated in the Lake Baikal basin. In this study, we rely on theoretical and practical approaches, and legislative and regulatory documents on the development of PAs and ecotourism. The analytical framework employed in this study encompasses eight fundamental areas of operation for national parks, specifically regarding the establishment of favorable conditions for ecotourism. Our information sources comprise official state reports, documents, and materials pertaining to the studied parks, as well as data obtained from expedition research, GPS tracks, and photo-sharing websites (social networks). Our findings show that efforts are being made in the parks to create favorable conditions for ecotourism development. These efforts include improving management practices, implementing functional zoning strategies, developing conceptual and design solutions, developing infrastructure, securing funding, engaging local communities, and promoting ecotourism services. Furthermore, our analysis has identified both strengths and weaknesses in the parks' approaches to ecotourism development (attracting private investment, infrastructure and staffing, monitoring of recreational impact). The TNP, being larger in size and better developed economically, has a more significant social and economic impact on people than the ZNP. The two studied parks demonstrate the implementation of the federal agenda for the development of ecotourism in national parks. It is important to remember that the positive effects of ecotourism initiatives in national parks can take time to materialize and require ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Documenting the parks' progress toward sustainable ecotourism as an acceptable type of economic activity in PAs can help identify successful strategies and areas for improvement, which contributes to biodiversity conservation and the well-being of local communities.

More than 80% of global water bodies fall under Case I (open ocean) waters, dominated by scattering and absorption associated with phytoplankton in the water column. Globally, previous studies show significant correlations between satellite-based retrieval methods and field measurements of absorbing and scattering constituents, while limited research from Australian coastal water bodies appears. This study presents a methodology to extract chlorophyll a properties from surface waters from near-coastal environments, within 2 km of coastline, in Tasmania, south-eastern Australia. We use general purpose, global, long-time series, multi-spectral satellite data, as opposed to ocean colour-specific sensor data. This approach may offer globally applicable tools for combining global satellite image archives with in situ field sensors for water quality monitoring. To enable applications from local to global scales, a cloud-based geospatial analysis workflow was developed and tested on several sites. This work represents the initial stage in developing a semi-automated near-coastal water-quality workflow using easily accessed, fully corrected global multi-spectral datasets alongside large-scale computation and delivery capabilities. Our results indicated a strong correlation between the in situ chlorophyll concentration data and blue-green band ratios from the multi-spectral sensor. In line with published research, environment-specific empirical models exhibited the highest correlations between in situ and satellite measurements, underscoring the importance of tailoring models to specific coastal waters. Our findings may provide the basis for developing this workflow for other sites in Australia. We acknowledge the use of general purpose multi-spectral data such as the Sentinel-2 and Landsat Series, their corrections and algorithms may not be as accurate and precise as ocean colour satellites. The data we are using are more readily accessible and also have true global coverage with global historic archives and regular, global collection will continue at least 10 years in the future. Regardless of sensor specifications, the retrieval method relies on localised algorithm calibration and validation using in situ measurements, which demonstrates close-to-realistic outputs. We hope this approach enables future applications to also consider these globally accessible and regularly updated datasets that are suited to coastal environments.

GLACINDIA is a multi-disciplinary project and unique, not only due to the participating institutions bringing together scientists from Norway and India, but also for the logistical challenges and the state-of-the-art science. In this particular case, we aim for detailed reconstructions of past glacier activity over the Holocene time scale (last similar to 11,700 years) emphasising different sediment parameters by means of statistical methods as well as integrating chronological uncertainties along with uncertainties of reconstructed glacier variability. We also aim to do oxygen isotope measurements on the pore water in addition to extracting lipids for leaf wax analysis in the sediment cores. A multi-proxy data set of lake sediments consisting of sedimentological, physical and geochemical analyses reflects all types of processes in the lake catchment that delivers sediments to the lake. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it is possible to extract the main process(es) driving the sediment variability in distal glacier-fed lakes. The common signal extracted from the sediment data is indicative of the main process in the catchment and is interpreted to vary in concert with the changing glacier equilibrium-line altitude over the region. Lake Chandra Tal has, based on earlier retrieved results from cosmogenic isotope dating, the potential to contain sediments deposited over the last 13,000 years, continuously deposited since the deglaciation after the glaciers retreated during the Late Glacial period. We, therefore, aim to do continuous reconstruction of climate with high temporal resolution for a better dynamical understanding of past climate. Understanding the controls of decadal, multi-decadal and century scale climate variability is crucial for many aspects of climate predictability. Climate reconstructions are important in order to validate Earth system modelling scenarios for the future; but there is at present a scarcity of consistent observational records from the Himalayas that can be used to understand and validate the existence of climate dynamics in this region.					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	KUMAR, OM/0000-0002-2293-6817; Mandal, Arindan/0000-0003-1616-6032; 													2395-7611	2395-7697					2016	2	1					103	112		10.3233/JCC-160011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JCC-160011													WOS:000414069000012
J	PFLUMIO, C; BOULEGUE, J; TIERCELIN, JJ				PFLUMIO, C; BOULEGUE, J; TIERCELIN, JJ			HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY IN THE NORTHERN TANGANYIKA RIFT, EAST-AFRICA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Hydrothermal fluids from sub-lacustrine and sub-aerial sites were sampled in the North Tanganyika Rift during the 1991 TANGANYDRO expedition. Two types of hydrothermal end-member fluids, a Na-HCO3 type and a Na-Cl type, have been identified within the sample set. The Na-HCO3 hydrothermal fluids are emitted at the level of the sub-lacustrine Pemba and sub-aerial Kabezi and Mashuzi sites, which are located in the northernmost Bujumbura sub-basin. The Na-Cl hydrothermal fluid vents at the level of the sub-lacustrine Cape Banza field, on the southeastern edge of the Ubwari ridge. The two types of hydrothermal fluids display isotopic and chemical evidence of interaction with magmatic volatiles. The magmatic effects are strongest in the fluid discharging on the Pemba hydrothermal field, where abundant CO2 bubbling accompanies fluid emission. The deltaC-13-values of the CO2 gas sampled at Pemba and at Cape Banza indicate a magmatic origin. The Pemba fluid shows the highest alkalinity and boron content and the lowest pH of the hydrothermal end-member fluids, and it has equilibrated at depth at the highest temperature (214 +/- 7-degrees-C). In addition, the sulfide mineralizations associated with the Pemba hydrothermal vents are enriched in As and Tl which, similarly to B, can be transported as volatiles in magmatic fluids. The northern Tanganyika Na-HCO3 fluids are similar to the Na-HCO3 fluid of the geothermal system of Lake Bogoria in the eastern branch of the East African Rift and they can be compared with the Na-HCO3 hydrothermal water that is inferred to flow into Lake Kivu. The Cape Banza Na-Cl fluids may derive from the mixing between meteoric water and a deep-seated basement brine similar to the ones found in old continental shields such as the Canadian Shield. The high equilibrium temperatures and the geochemistry of the North Tanganyika Rift hydrothermal fluids suggest that degassing magmatic bodies are present at depth in the area. These magmatic bodies may be either the southern expression of the South Kivu magmatism or a more recent activity not yet expressed as surface volcanism. The hydrothermal sites are located along major active rift bounding faults, which can be associated with deep and strong seismicity as in the case of the Pemba field. Such deep fractures may have favoured the uprise of the magmatic bodies that are the source of heat and volatiles to the hydrothermal systems. The circulation of hydrothermal fluids within the Tanganyika lacustrine sedimentary pile could play an important role in the maturation of the organic matter enclosed in the lake sediments and the subsequent oil generation and migration.																			0009-2541					SEP 1	1994	116	1-2					85	109		10.1016/0009-2541(94)90159-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(94)90159-7													WOS:A1994PF44700006

Screening Level Assessment of Metal Concentrations in Streambed Sediments and Floodplain Soils within the Grand Lake Watershed in Northeastern Oklahoma, USA	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Metal releases have been received by the Grand Lake watershed from the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD) since the mid 1800s. To address data gaps in metal distributions in the Oklahoma portion of the watershed, streambed sediment and floodplain soil was sampled on various streams. The < 63-A mu m fraction was analyzed for Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations by portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Mean metal concentration results at reference transects indicated that background sediment/soil concentrations for Cd, Pb, and Zn within the watershed were 0.5, 19, and 68 mg/kg, respectively. A significant difference in the distributions of metal concentrations was found between reference and impacted transects (Cd, Pb, Zn: p = 0.00; Cd: n = 29; Pb, Zn: n = 283). These results demonstrated that concentrations of metals in streambed sediments and floodplain soils were significantly higher in areas downstream of major mining influences relative to upstream reference sites, and the source of metal contamination within these media was the result of mining releases from the TSMD. Toxicity risks to benthic macroinvertebrates were evaluated using a TSMD-specific sediment mixture model (aPEC-Q(Cd,Pb,Zn)) for metals (MacDonald et al. in Development and evaluation of sediment and pore-water toxicity thresholds to support sediment quality assessments in the Tri-State Mining District (TSMD), Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Draft Final Technical Report. Volume I: Text. Prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Prepared by MacDonald Environmental Sciences Ltd., U.S. Geological Survey, and CH2M Hill, Nanaimo, 2009). Toxicity risks to plant populations were also assessed by comparing soil metal concentrations to Ecological Soil Screening Levels (Eco-SSLs). It was found that the survival and/or biomass of benthic invertebrates was highly impacted at Tar Creek, highly to moderately impacted at Spring River and Elm Creek, and unimpacted at Lost Creek and Grand Lake as a result of sediment metal concentrations. It also was found that soil metal concentrations were likely sufficient to impact plant populations at all streams. Within the Oklahoma portion of the watershed, the majority of environmental studies, remediation, and restoration efforts by local, state, and federal agencies have been primarily focused within the Tar Creek Superfund Site (TCSS) boundary. Importantly, the findings of this study highlighted the downstream extent of metals contamination as well as the resulting potential toxicities to benthic invertebrates and plants that is present outside of the TCSS boundary. Because the Oklahoma portion of the watershed comprises the jurisdictional lands of ten tribes, these results emphasized the potential tribal loss of use of benthic invertebrates and plants due to their decline in population as a result of metal toxicity. These overall findings provide an important basis for future data needs in assessing metal concentrations in aquatic and terrestrial biota that are consumed by tribal communities within the watershed to determine if certain organisms are unsafe to consume or warrant consumption advisories. This will allow risk assessors and risk managers to better understand the potential loss of use of tribal biological resources as well as improving risk-based decision making to be protective of these resources and tribal human health.						, Ean/0000-0002-1680-8827													0090-4341	1432-0703				APR	2017	72	3					349	363		10.1007/s00244-017-0376-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-017-0376-y								28229194					WOS:000398698400003
J	WHARTON, RA; LYONS, WB; MARAIS, DJD				WHARTON, RA; LYONS, WB; MARAIS, DJD			STABLE ISOTOPIC BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF CARBON AND NITROGEN IN A PERENNIALLY ICE-COVERED ANTARCTIC LAKE	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Lake Hoare (77-degrees-38'S, 162-degrees-53'E) is an amictic, oligotrophic, 34-m-deep, closed-basin lake in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Its perennial ice cover minimizes wind-generated currents and reduces light penetration, as well as restricts sediment deposition into the lake and the exchange of atmospheric gases between the water column and the atmosphere. The biological community of Lake Hoare consists solely of microorganisms - both planktonic populations and benthic microbial mats. Lake Hoare is one of several perennially ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys that represent the end-member conditions of cold desert and saline lakes. The dry valley lakes provide a unique opportunity to examine lacustrine processes that operate at all latitudes, but under an extreme set of environmental conditions. The dry valley lakes may also offer a valuable record of catchment and global changes in the past and present. Furthermore. these lakes are modern-day equivalents of periglacial lakes that are likely to have been common during periods of glacial maxima at temperate latitudes. We have analyzed the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of Lake Hoare for deltaC-13 and the organic matter of the sediments and sediment-trap material for deltaC-13 and deltaN-15. The deltaC-13 of the DIC indicates that C-12 is differentially removed in the shallow, oxic portions of the lake via photosynthesis. In the anoxic portions of the lake (27-34 m) a net addition of C-12 to the DIC pool occurs via organic matter decomposition. The dissolution of CaCO3 at depth also contributes to the DIC pool. Except near the Canada Glacier where a substantial amount of allochthonous organic matter enters the lake, the organic carbon being deposited on the lake bottom at different sites is isotopically similar, suggesting an autochthonous source for the organic carbon. Preliminary inorganic carbon flux calculations suggest that a high percentage of the organic carbon fixed in the water column is remineralized as it falls through the water column. At nearby Lake Fryxell, the substantial (relative to Lake Hoare) glacial meltstream input overprints Fryxell's shallow-water biological deltaC-13 signal with deltaC-13-depleted DIC. In contrast, Lake Hoare is not significantly affected by surface-water input and mixing, and therefore the deltaC-13 patterns observed arise primarily from biological dynamics within the lake. Organic matter in Lake Hoare is depleted in N-15, which we suggest is partially the result of the addition of relatively light inorganic nitrogen into the lake system from terrestrial sources.																			0009-2541					JUL 20	1993	107	1-2					159	172		10.1016/0009-2541(93)90108-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(93)90108-U								11539299					WOS:A1993LP58800011

Sulfur cycle in the Valles Caldera volcanic complex, New Mexico - Letter 1: Sulfate sources in aqueous system, and implications for S isotope record in Gale Crater on Mars	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Initial in situ sulfur (S) isotope measurements of the Martian bedrock in Gale Crater have revealed an unexpectedly wide range of delta S-34 values (-47 to +28 parts per thousand). Generally, it is unclear what processes could have contributed to these large isotope fractionations. Therefore, we studied S sources and aqueous SO42- cycling in the Valles Caldera volcanic complex, New Mexico to better understand S isotope fractionations related to S degassing, hydrothermal activity, and low-temperature processes in aqueous environment. Overall, our study demonstrates that volcanic systems show large spatial heterogeneity in delta S-34. Magmatic S sources are obvious in steam-dominated H2S degassing and precipitation of secondary minerals from hydrothermal fluids with low delta S-34 values of +0.9 +/- 3 parts per thousand. Locally, however, hydrothermal processes have resulted in more negative delta S-34 values in sulfide minerals (-18 to -4 parts per thousand) and more positive delta S-34 values in sulfate minerals (-1 to +3 parts per thousand). Major aqueous SO42- sources are oxidation of H2S from modern hydrothermal gas emission, and oxidation and dissolution of sulfide and sulfate minerals present in the hydrothermally altered bedrock and crater-lake sediments. The delta S-34 of aqueous SO42- in surface water and groundwater varies widely (-8 to +5 parts per thousand) and is similar to major S endmembers that undergo oxidation and/or dissolution by active hydrological system. Minor SO42- contributions with more positive delta S-34 values (+9 to +14 parts per thousand) come from deeply circulating geothermal fluids and negligible amounts from atmospheric deposition (+5 to +7 parts per thousand in snow). Elevated SO42- contents are mainly associated with modern and past H2S emissions and oxidations near the surface. On regional scale, however, most of the intracaldera bedrock is S-depleted, thus the SO42- contents are usually low in the surface aquatic system and younger sedimentary lake deposits formed at times of negligible near surface hydrothermal activity. In general, magmatic-hydrothermal processes apparently cause the largest delta S-34 variation in S-bearing minerals on volcanic terrains. Therefore, we infer that the measured wide range of delta S-34 values in the Gale sediments by the Curiosity rover on Mars can be explained by S isotope composition of magmatic-hydrothermal sulfide and sulfate minerals that were present in the initial igneous/volcanic rocks prior to crater formation. Later aqueous processes involved oxidation and dissolution of S minerals initially present in these rocks and led to subsequent formation of diagenetic fluids and alteration products enriched in SO42- with relatively large delta S-34 variation. Additionally, physical erosion, transport and deposition of detrital hydrothermal S minerals from igneous/volcanic rocks might be in part responsible for the measured wide range of delta S-34 in Gale Crater. These unique S isotope results, measured in situ on another planet for the first time, imply the importance of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids in S transport on early Mars and their subsequent alteration in low-temperature aqueous environments.

The impact of temporal patterns of temperature and precipitation on silver Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) spawning events	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												It was revealed that Gibel carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782) spawning phenology is determined by regular patterns of variability in temperature and precipitation over the period of time after spawning in the previous year. The sensitivity to temperature of water as a stimulus to spawning was shown as being dependent on the characteristics of the environment and fish development trajectories over the previous year. Information about fish spawning was collected in the Dnipro-Orylskiy Nature Reserve in the following locations: Nikolayev system of water bodies, River Protoch system and the Obukhov floodplain, the channel of the River Dnipro, water bodies of the Taromske ledge. The materials that formed the basis of this research were collected from the waters of the reserve in the years 1997-2018. There are dependencies between the air and water temperatures that have their own characteristics depending on the type of water body. These dependencies are described by a logistic equation. The temperature regime in water bodies of the Taromske ledge is very similar to the temperature regime of Nikolayev system of water bodies. The difference is that the spring period of the temperature increase in water bodies of the Taromske ledge comes earlier - in late February - early March. The air temperature dynamics over the year is described by the fourth degree polynomial. The residuals of the polynomial regression for each year were subjected to principal component analysis. The principal component analysis allowed us to identify 8 principal components of the temperature regimes, which together describe 59.2% of the variation of the residual of the polynomial trend. Deviations from the linear trend of the precipitation are systematic throughout the year, reflecting the uneven nature of rainfall during the year. The residuals of linear trend regression models of cumulative precipitation can be used as indicators of the dynamics characteristic of precipitation during the year. The residuals were used for principal component analysis, which revealed that the dynamics of the precipitation can be divided into five orthogonal principal components. The first five principal components explain 82.6% of the feature space variation. The timing of the onset of C. gibelio spawning in 95% of cases occurs on the 113-139th days of the year (on average, it takes place on the 125th day). Regression analysis revealed that the climate principal components and types of the lake systems can explain 79% of the variation in the timing of the onset of C. gibelio spawning. The water temperature at the time of C. gibelio spawning was exposed to natural dynamics in year aspect. The local minimum of the onset of spawning temperatures occured in the mid 2000s. Total of 69% of the water temperature variation at which spawning begins can be described by climatic predictors and water biotope types. The variation explained by some temperature principal components may be increased considerably after including as covariates such variables as the precipitation principal component and the biotope type. This principal component which represents the high frequency variation of the air temperature regime with a characteristic period 20 and 45 days has the highest explanation ability of all the components and is a constant explanatory predictor for all considered spawning characteristics.

Northwest China will be an important developing region of China in the 21st century. Yaoba is a well-irrigation oasis within this arid area, which is located in the Alxa area west of the Helan Mountains and next to the Tengger desert in the east. It has contributed greatly to the local stock raising and agriculture since its development in 1970. However, the groundwater which the oasis depends on to survive has been getting salinized gradually and more serious in recent years. A comprehensive study was carried out using the methods of groundwater environment isotope analysis, lithofacies and palaeogeography, calculations of water-rock interaction and the existing form of chemical components in groundwater etc. It has been found that the salinization of groundwater is mainly caused by reinfiltration water solving the salt in soil which is deposited simultaneously with the sediments and accumulated in the vadose zone due to strong evaporation in the arid climate for the running of an irrigation scheme. The saline groundwater in the Taosu Lake area southwest of the oasis is preliminarily regarded as the main source of groundwater salinization. However, it has been found that the groundwater has great differences in the D, O-18, H-3 and NO3- concentrations with that in the oasis, that is, the former plays only a limited role in the salinization of groundwater in the oasis. The HST3D model (a computer code for the simulation of heat and solute transport in a three-dimensional groundwater system) was used to simulate the TDS movement in the oasis. A good simulation result has been obtained with the mean simulation error of 4.7% and the simulation trend is reasonable. It is proved that there is 3.0-4.0x10(5) m(3)/a of reinfiltrated irrigation water in 3 main spots in the oasis. The oasis irrigation manner, winter irrigation to wash salt, the increase of wheat planting area, and no amount limit to water users (the farmers) are the main factors for causing the increase of water consumption as well as the groundwater salinization. The control measures on the groundwater salinization should include the establishement of reasonable irrigation regulations, water use limitation measures, flood utilization project, saltwater discharge, sealing of the upper layers to prevent the saline water to enter the pumping wells.

Specifics of Chemical Composition Origin of Surface Water in the Arctic Zone of Western Siberia	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												One of the most urgent problems on which current studies of Arctic and subarctic territories are focused is how permafrost thawing can affect organic carbon fluxes and how these fluxes can influence the geochemistry of the surface and ground water. In addition to disturbing the carbon balance, permafrost thawing provokes the release of a significant amount of other chemical elements entering natural waters. The paper presents original data obtained by studying surface water in 2020 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District, which is situated in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. Permafrost is widespread in the study area, as also are facilities of the oil and gas industry. This predetermines the importance of research on the chemical composition of natural water, its formation, and ecological-geochemical status, which are critical aspects for assessing the anthropogenic load and predicting the influence of climate changes on the biogeochemical cycles of chemical elements. In the course of our fieldwork, 47 surface water samples were taken in the basins of the Taz, Pur, Ob, and Nadym rivers: 23 samples from rivers and streams and 24 samples from lakes and thaw depressions. The sampling sites were chosen to as comprehensively as possible cover the lake-stream-river system in the catchment areas of major rivers of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. The chemical composition of the water samples was analyzed at a certified laboratory using methods conventionally applied in solving such problems. The data were processed using statistical methods, including the principal component analysis (PCA). Data analysis demonstrates that surface water in the study area is ultrafresh, with neutral or weakly alkaline pH values. Hydrocarbonate, calcium, and magnesium ions dominate in the ionic composition of the water, and ammonium contents are high in the waters of the lakes and thaw depressions. In addition, the ammonium concentration strongly positively correlates with the content of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the values of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and permanganate index (PI). It was found out that the streams (springs and rivers) differ from the lakes and the water of the thaw depressions in higher concentrations of main ions that are brought to the water mainly by natural factors (these are HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) and higher total dissolved solids (TDS) and pH values. In contrast, the water of the thaw depressions is characterized by the highest concentrations of DOC and the values of other parameters related to organic matter (N-NH4+, COD, and PI). It was shown that the main factors that control the chemical composition of the water are its interaction with organic matter from organic (peat) soil horizons and the mineral components of the underlying rocks and soils. The former factor most significantly impacts the water of the thaw depressions, and the latter one affects mainly the chemical composition of the rivers and streams. The relatively high contents of the chloride and sodium ions in the water of the largest lakes are probably caused by the anthropogenic load.					; Denis, Sokolov/AAE-7240-2020; Ivanova, Irina/N-5552-2015; Soldatova, Evgeniya/B-7096-2016	Denis, Sokolov/0000-0002-7859-7244; Soldatova, Evgeniya/0000-0003-3967-4822													0016-7029	1556-1968				NOV	2022	60	11					1153	1166		10.1134/S0016702922100093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0016702922100093													WOS:000873845600008
C	Webb, JW			USCOLD; USCOLD	Webb, JW			Reservoir operations & constraints of an aging system Muskingum Watershed, 1935-present	DAM O&M ISSUES - THE CHALLENGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY					20th Annual Meeting of the United-States-Committee-on-Large-Dams	JUL 10-14, 2000	SEATTL, WA	US Comm Large Dams, Ad Hoc USCOLD Joint Sub Comm O&M Issues				The Huntington District Corps of Engineers is responsible for operating and maintaining sixteen flood control reservoirs within the Muskingum River Basin. The Muskingum River Basin, situated in the east central part of Ohio, drains 8,051 square miles which equates to 20% of the land area of the state. More than half of the drainage basin is controlled by the existing system of reservoirs most of which were constructed in the 1930's. As a result of the continuing partnering efforts between Huntington District Corps of Engineers and Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District (MWCD), several reservoir management issues have been identified. Since the development of the original Water Control Plan in 1935, changes in basin conditions and land uses have resulted in modifications to operational considerations for the reservoir system. Eight lakes are drawn down each year during the winter months at the request of MWCD. The original purpose for drawing the lakes down was environmental in nature, but an additional benefit resulted by providing approximately 5 to 29% increase in flood control storage depending on location. The flood control benefits of performing the drawdowns are obvious, but the perceived environmental consequences may outweigh the benefits. Due to a variety of changes that have occurred in the basin since the original plan was developed, there is a need to undertake a review of the official plan for the reservoir system. The review should consider the impacts of existing operational constraints throughout the basin and should determine the most appropriate mix of modifications and revisions that will address the problems. Specific evaluations should be undertaken to evaluate current flood control capability, which is the major purpose of the basin system. The public should be apprised of the impacts of potential changes and the significance of environmental and legal issues. Partnering efforts by Huntington District and MWCD are proceeding to consider those measures that can be addressed on an interim basis. This paper will present the results/requirements associated with an ongoing investigation under the authority of Section 216 of the River and Harbor Act of 1970. The Huntington District is currently preparing an initial appraisal report for a Section 216 Study that is the first step toward recommending a review of this aging system. The appraisal will assess the impact that current problems are having on effective accomplishment of authorized project purposes.																					1-884575-16-1				2000							63	76																WOS:000176360100006

Estimating mortality of Lake Sturgeon in the Lake Winnebago system using traditional age-based approaches and capture-recapture models	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective The Lake Winnebago system in Wisconsin supports a popular winter spear fishery for Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens. Setting harvest caps for this fishery relies on estimating instantaneous natural mortality rate (M), which can be done using age-based approaches or capture-recapture models that incorporate recoveries of fish with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags or detections of fish with acoustic transmitters. Our objectives were to determine (1) if recent estimates of exploitation (u) have exceeded the 5% harvest cap, (2) if M and total mortality rates are similar among estimation methods that rely on age estimates or capture-recapture methods, and (3) if potential differences in mortality estimates would affect harvest caps.Methods Harvest of PIT-tagged fish was used to evaluate u from 2010 to 2019. Catch curves incorporating corrected fin ray ages were used to estimate total mortality and M for fish collected from 2010 to 2019. Capture-recapture models were used to estimate annual survival and M from detections of fish with acoustic transmitters from 2007 to 2019 and recoveries of PIT-tagged fish from 1999 to 2020. Mortality estimates were used to calculate and compare sex-specific harvest caps among estimation methods.Results Observed u did not exceed 5% for either sex between 2010 and 2019. Estimates of M varied among methods (males: M = 0.001-0.134; females: M = 0.001-0.131), with PIT-based models consistently providing the lowest and telemetry-based models providing the highest estimates. Simulations indicated that female u has limited potential to exceed 5% if M from fin ray ages or telemetry is used to set harvest caps, while PIT-based simulations showed no indication of cap exceedance.Conclusions Harvest management practices in the Lake Winnebago system appear to have kept Lake Sturgeon exploitation below the 5% harvest cap from 2010 to 2019. Capture-recapture models relying on PIT tags appear to provide the most precise approach for setting harvest caps for this fishery. Using capture-recapture models based on PIT tags to estimate natural mortality appears to provide the most precise approach for setting harvest caps for the Lake Sturgeon spear fishery that occurs on the Lake Winnebago system.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2025	45	4					616	632		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf044		JUL 2025											WOS:001541654300001

Rapid climate warming, cryosphere degradation and increasing rainfall are transforming catchments and land-water interactions, altering lake carbon cycling in unprecedented ways. Here, we present Holocene (past 10.5 ka) sediment records from a small northern Fennoscandian lake to elucidate linkages of past hydroclimate change and lake carbon cycling. Using elemental and stable isotope composition of organic matter (C%, N%, delta 13C, delta 15N), age control from 23 radiocarbon dates, and a ground-penetrating radar survey of lake sediment layers, we reconstructed organic matter burial and sources, aided with a Bayesian end-member mixing model based on measurements from modern terrestrial and aquatic vegetation and particulate organic matter. The hydroclimate and lake hydrological regime changes were interpreted from lake-water delta 18O (delta 18Olw) reconstructed from subfossil chironomid (Chironomidae; non-biting midges) head capsules and delta 18O and delta 2H monitoring of local meteoric, lake and groundwaters. The delta 18Olw and carbon burial mirror the Holocene temperature pattern, increasing in the cooler early Holocene, at their maxima in the warm mid-Holocene, and decreasing during the late Holocene cooling. The lake was dominated by aquatic organic matter through the Holocene, with benthic sources more dominant in the early Holocene and planktic in the late Holocene. A slight increase in the terrestrial organic matter proportion occurred in the warm and dry mid-Holocene despite reduced hydrological connectivity, which is contrary to the hypothesis that wetter climate increases allochtonous C burial. The higher mid-Holocene delta 18Olw values were superimposed by lower values at ca. 6.5 cal ka BP, interpreted as increased winter precipitation contributing to snowmelt and isotopically light groundwater impacting delta 18Olw. This interval is coupled with highly siliceous sediment deposition indicating marked aquatic productivity, possibly linked with inputs of groundwater rich in silica and phosphorous. Our findings underscore the importance of hydrological connectivity on both burial and sourcing of C in high-latitude lakes, and suggest that in future wetter climate, high-latitude lakes may play more important role as processors than sinks of carbon.

J	Netzel, T; Miebach, A; Litt, T; Hense, A				Netzel, Timon; Miebach, Andrea; Litt, Thomas; Hense, Andreas			New probabilistic methods for quantitative climate reconstructions applied to palynological data from Lake Kinneret	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Quantitative local paleoclimate reconstructions are an important tool for gaining insights into the climate history of the Earth. The complex age-sediment-depth and proxy-climate relationships must be described in an appropriate way. Bayesian hierarchical models are a promising method for describing such structures.In this study, we present a new age-depth transformation in a Bayesian formulation by determining the uncertainty information of depths in lake sediments at a given age. This enables data-driven smoothing of past periods, which allows better interpretation.We introduce a systematic, machine-learning-based way to establish probabilistic transfer functions which connect spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation to the spatial presence of specific biomes. This includes consideration of various machine learning (ML) algorithms for solving the classification problem of biome presence and absence, taking into account uncertainties in the proxy-climate relationship. For the models and biome distributions used, a simple feedforward neural network provides the optimal choice of the classification problem.Based on this, we formulate a new Bayesian hierarchical model that generates local paleoclimate reconstructions. This is applied to plant-based proxy data from the lake sediment of Lake Kinneret (LK). Here, a priori information on the recent climate in this region and data on arboreal pollen from this lake are used as boundary conditions. To solve this model, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. During the inference process, our new method generates taxa weights and biome climate ranges. The former shows that less weight needs to be given to Olea europaea to ensure the influence of the other taxa. In contrast, the highest weights are found in Quercus calliprinos and Amaranthaceae, resulting in appropriate flexibility under the given boundary conditions. In terms of climate ranges, the posterior probability of the Mediterranean biome reveals the greatest change, with an average boreal winter (December-February) temperature of 10 degrees C and an annual precipitation of 700 mm for Lake Kinneret during the Holocene. The paleoclimate reconstruction for this period shows comparatively low precipitation of about 400 mm during 9-7 and 4-2 cal ka BP. The respective temperatures fluctuate much less and stay around 10 degrees C.																			1814-9324	1814-9332				FEB 4	2025	21	2					357	380		10.5194/cp-21-357-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-21-357-2025													WOS:001412165200001

Lacustrine sedimentation by powerful storm waves in Gale crater and its implications for a warming episode on Mars	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												This investigation documents that the Rugged Terrain Unit, the Stimson formation, and the Greenheugh sandstone were deposited in a 1200 m-deep lake that formed after the emergence of Mt. Sharp in Gale crater, Mars, nearly 4 billion years ago. In fact, the Curiosity rover traversed on a surface that once was the bottom of this lake and systematically examined the strata that were deposited in its deepest waters on the crater floor to layers that formed along its shoreline on Mt. Sharp. This provided a rare opportunity to document the evolution of one aqueous episode from its inception to its desiccation and to determine the warming mechanism that caused it. Deep water lacustrine siltstones directly overlie conglomerates that were deposited by mega floods on the crater floor. This indicates that the inception phase of the lake was sudden and took place when flood waters poured into the crater. The lake expanded quickly and its shoreline moved up the slope of Mt. Sharp during the lake-level rise phase and deposited a layer of sandstone with large cross beds under the influence of powerful storm waves. The lake-level highstand phase was dominated by strong bottom currents that transported sediments downhill and deposited one of the most distinctive sedimentological features in Gale crater: a layer of sandstone with a 3 km-long field of meter-high subaqueous antidunes (the Washboard) on Mt. Sharp. Bottom current continued downhill and deposited sandstone and siltstone on the foothills of Mt. Sharp and on the crater floor, respectively. The lake-level fall phase caused major erosion of lacustrine strata that resulted in their patchy distribution on Mt. Sharp. Eroded sediments were then transported to deep waters by gravity flows and were re-deposited as conglomerate and sandstone in subaqueous channels and in debris flow fans. The desiccation phase took place in calm waters of the lake. The aqueous episode we investigated was vigorous but short-lived. Its characteristics as determined by our sedimentological study matches those predicted by an asteroid impact. This suggests that the heat generated by an impact transformed Mars into a warm, wet, and turbulent planet. It resulted in planet-wide torrential rain, giant floods on land, powerful storms in the atmosphere, and strong waves in lakes. The absence of age dates prevents the determination of how long the lake existed. Speculative rates of lake-level change suggest that the lake could have lasted for a period ranging from 16 to 240 Ky.

J	Boyer, KB; Kieser, MS				Boyer, K. Brian; Kieser, Mark S.			URBAN STORMWATER MANGEMENT-AN MS4 SUCCESS STORY FOR WESTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY	JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING												Regulation of stormwater runoff is increasing throughout the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state agencies are beginning to move toward effluent and/or load limits for pollutants in stormwater. Compliance costs for treating urban stormwater runoff, especially in highly-developed areas where retrofits are required, will only continue to increase. Western Michigan University (WMU) is a permitted Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) along Arcadia Creek and the West Fork of Portage Creek in Kalamazoo, Michigan. As such, it falls within the nonpoint source (NPS) load allocation for a phosphorus total maximum daily load (TMDL) developed for the Kalamazoo River and Lake Allegan (refer to Figures 1 and 2 for location maps). The Kalamazoo River TMDL was established in 2001 and requires a 50% reduction in total phosphorus (TP) originating from NPSs, using the 1998 load as a baseline. The original timeline outlined in the TMDL set 2009 as the target date for meeting the TP reduction goal. To date, no other MS4s (or any other NPSs) in the watershed have been able to document progress or demonstrate an ability to meet this goal. WMU has employed a unique approach toward resolving their stormwater concerns, which include MS4 permit requirements, TMDL compliance, and flooding. The University's efforts have utilized federal/state grant funding and strategic MS4 partnerships to implement stormwater best management practices (BMPs) identified within an EPA-approved Watershed Management Plan. Efforts also included applying engineering designs to target floodplain enhancements, TMDL compliance, flood mitigation, and infrastructure protection. During the past decade, WMU implemented 14 stormwater BMPs. The most recent stormwater BMP project leveraged state funding and was completed in November 2011. The project focused on multiple goals: reducing direct discharges of urban stormwater runoff to surface waters; naturalizing conveyances and stream corridors using native plants; repairing erosion caused by urban runoff; restoring original floodplains; reducing phosphorus and sediment loads to tributaries of the Kalamazoo River; and increasing groundwater recharge. In 2011, a WMU TMDL Compliance Planning Project demonstrated that WMU has achieved TP load reductions sufficient to meet TMDL load allocation compliance goals. The final TMDL Compliance Plan document provided a "road map" outlining future implementation of on-campus and off-campus stormwater BMPs. This plan will also help move WMU into a position of becoming Stormwater Neutral (TM). A framework for a water quality monitoring program also was included in the plan to enable successful measurement of stormwater BMP effectiveness. To complement the compliance plan, several BMP treatment recommendations for future implementation were pre-designed. These designs clearly defined costs and environmental benefits in terms of water quality and hydrology improvements to ensure that efforts are reasonable, feasible, and beneficial.																			1552-6100						2012	7	1					28	39		10.3992/jgb.7.1.28	http://dx.doi.org/10.3992/jgb.7.1.28													WOS:000303729200003

Location Lake Rouge Tougjarv (Estonia), a small lake with annually laminated lake sediments situated in a dense prehistoric setting. Methods The chronology of the palaeodata is based on the annual laminations supported by AMS C-14 and Pb-210 dating and Cs-137, Am-241, and spheroidal carbonaceous particle marker horizons. The time-scale and resolution allows fine sampling (the pollen samples generally comprise 3.5 years) and vegetation change reconstruction. Relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) of the lake was estimated, and the statistical zonation, rate of change, palynological richness, and DCA and PCA ordinations were generated on the basis of the pollen data. The historical calibration data set (maps, numerical information on population, domestic stock, farmland division, etc.) is based on archival material preserved in the Estonian Historical Archives. Results The topmost part (0-180 cm) of the sediment column of Lake Rouge Tougjarv, covering the last 1000 years, is visibly laminated carbonaceous gyttja. The varve chronology extends from ad 2000 to ad 1339, with a cumulative +/- 9-year error estimate. Beyond this the chronology is extrapolated using the C-14 date and varve age-depth estimations. The simulation of the RSAP of Lake Tougjarv shows that the major portion of the pollen loading originating from local vegetation is derived from plants growing within 2000 m of the sampling site. The pollen record divides into five statistically significant subgroups, which fall on the PCA plot into three clusters reflecting the general openness-closedness of the landscape. During the period between ad 1000 and 1200 (RT 1) the Rouge area was generally wooded with birch, spruce and pine forests. The advancement of extensive farming gradually opened up the landscape between ad 1200 and 1650 (RT 2 and RT 3). The maximum openness of the landscape was reached between ad 1650 and 1875 (RT 4), with the most open period in the late eighteenth century. Historical maps from 1684 and 1870-99 and available quantitative data on population, domestic stock, farmland division, etc. show the same trend. The pollen data covering the last 125 years, and maps from 1935 and 1995, show the reduction of arable land in RSAP of the lake under investigation and the reduction of open land to an extent comparable with the end of the seventeenth century. Main conclusions The formation and development of the cultural landscape at Rouge over the last 1000 years is characterized by rapid changes in floristic richness and rates of vegetation change attributed to certain historic processes in the RSAP. Five phases of landscape and social development are clearly distinguished during the last 1000 years. The decadal scale vegetation response to human-induced forcing agrees with historical maps and documents and could be used for past landscapes prior to the period with solid historical data.

The fish Hubbsina turneri de Buen (1940) was studied as a model species in a historical context at varying locations. Originally distributed only in the Lerma-Chapala basin, the main lake complex in Mexico, this species has not been collected from Lake Cuitzeo (LC) and now is restricted to Lake Zacapu (LZ). At present, the Highland splitfin is classified as critically endangered. Methods: Historical information of LC and historical and current information from LZ were explored by applying cluster analysis and generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to describe the biotic interactions among fish species and the relationship between density and environmental variables, respectively. The two lakes' contrasting abioticibiotic characteristics provided elements to describe some species distribution limits in chemical ion gradients. Extirpation calendar dates were estimated using an optimal linear estimation method. Finally, a bibliographic review was conducted on the causes that promoted the extirpation and restriction of H. turneri and the prognosis for its reestablishment and conservation. Results: Clusters showed the fishes relationship according to their distribution along the lakes. GAMM indicated that high H. turneri density is related to low hardness/fecal coliforms, medium depth/suspended solids, and high oxygen concentration. Estimated extirpation dates were between the years 2013 and 2018. The extirpation was linked to an abrupt drop in the LC voltune, water quality degradation, increased biotic interactions within macrophytes habitats with native and introduced species, and fisheries bycatches. The current restricted range of H. turneri resulted from the draining of the larger lake, forcing the remaining populations to small spring-fed remnants. Recent samplings in LZ resulted in a low number of individuals. Conclusions: The integration of ecological interactions derived from statistical models, extirpation dates from nonparametric tests, and the exhaustive analysis of historical information can be applied to define the current situation of imperiled, ecologically relevant species, in different aquatic ecosystems. We are confident that this general framework is important for determining (1) the requirements and limitations of populations regarding abiotic variables, (2) biotic interactions (trophic and spatial) with native and introduced species, and (3) different anthropogenic stressors within and around the ecosystem. This knowledge will also allow understanding those aspects that contribute to the extirpation of populations and could help the restoration of the habitat and the reintroduction of extirpated species.					del Monte-Luna, Pablo/IZE-2405-2023; De La Cruz - Aguero, Jose/Q-8224-2018; De La Cruz-Agüero, José/Q-8224-2018; López-López, Eugenia/AAI-2646-2019; Ramirez, Juan Pablo/ITU-5096-2023; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/Q-8229-2018	De La Cruz - Aguero, Jose/0000-0002-8560-0720; 													2768-6701	2768-6698				MAY	2022	27	5							165	10.31083/j.fbl2705165	http://dx.doi.org/10.31083/j.fbl2705165								35638432					WOS:000807685700015

Fluid geochemistry of Lessini Mountain's thermal area: New data from Caldiero, S. Ambrogio-Cola di Lazise and Sirmione hydrothermal districts (Verona-Brescia Provinces, Italy)	GEOTHERMICS												The Po Plain, located in northern Italy between the Alps and the Apennines, hosts several thermal water spots. Some of these thermal waters belong to the thermal districts of Brescia and Verona provinces. This thermalism has been used for therapeutical purposes since the "Roman Age ". During Sept. 2014 - Aug. 2015, a detailed sampling program was carried out to collect water samples of thermal and cold waters in the Lessini Mountain's thermal area, including those in the Sirmione thermal district (project area). Assessment of water chemistry and isotope data, identified distinctive characteristics of thermal waters belonging to the thermal districts investigated in this project (i.e. Caldiero, S.Ambrogio Valpolicella, Cola di Lazise, Lazise and Sirmione). In particular, data show that the Sirmione thermal waters are characterized by a higher temperature and a total salinity and by chemical and isotopic fingerprints that are distinct and unrelated to those of other thermal waters. On the other hand, the data indicate potential correlations between samples from S.Ambrogio Valpolicella and Cola di Lazise and local cold water. Geochemical modeling conducted using PHREEQC, showed that a mixing accompanied by calcite precipitation can explain the chemical characteristics observed in the thermal waters and some cold springs assessed in this project. New geothermometric estimations were performed for main thermal components, obtaining temperature ranges (in degrees C) of about 92-99, 67-74 and 51-58, respectively for Sirmione, S. Ambrogio Valpolicella-Cola di Lazise and Caldiero thermal districts. Temperature ranges obtained in this work were used to gain an insight into the possible depth reached by thermal waters in the project area, which is characterized by the normal geothermal gradient (30 degrees C/Km). Finally, geochemical findings were elaborated and integrated with geological and structural data in a proposed conceptual model of water circulation. The agreement within data sets is satisfactory in particular in relation to the depth of carbonate-evaporite formations, which represent the thermal reservoirs. Infiltrating waters can seep into the deep through fractured rocks, reaching the Carnian to Upper Cretaceous carbonates and evaporites. In the Caldiero thermal districts the depth reached by thermal waters coincides with the level of the Carnian evaporites (approximate to 1.3-1.6 Km) and it agrees with the important role played by dissolved sulphates evidenced by geochemical data. Thermal fluids in Sirmione and S. Ambrogio Valpolicella - Cola di Lazise thermal districts likely interact with Permian-Middle Triassic formations, which are located at greater depths (approximate to 2.7-3 Km and approximate to 1.9-2.1 Km, respectively). Once heated at depth, thermal fluids rise through main faults and/or thrust faults, where they may be diluted by circulating surface cold waters.

J	Paichoon, MS				Paichoon, Mohamad Sharifi			Analysis of the origin, formation and development of sand ramps on the Eastern slopes of Shirkouh, Yazd, Central Iran	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The purpose of this study is to examine the sand ramps in the margin of Ernan playa located in Yazd Province, central Iran. The region is marked with several sand ramps, many of which are not observable as they are buried under colluvial and alluvial sediments or dense vegetation. Field studies indicated at least 18 fairly large sand ramps in the region in the form of both climbing and falling dunes. These sand ramps were formed mostly in the past and are stable and inactive now. However, in some parts of the region in question, these landforms are still forming and developing. The results indicated that the sediment, especially those of the sand ramps on windward slopes, have large grains. Also, over 50 percent of the sediments generally have grains with a diameter of more than 1 mm. The presence of such minerals as Alkali Feldspar, Plagioclase, Quartz, Biotite, Muscovite, Amphibole, and Apatite, respectively in terms of quantity and frequency, in the sand ramp sediments indicates that the origin of sand ramp sediments is the monzogranites of the eastern slope of Shirkouh Mountain with the same texture and frequency. The very fact that the above-mentioned minerals are intact, i.e. they have not been rounded or eroded, suggests that these sediments have not been displaced a lot. The study of the developing sand ramps proved that such structures form at the height of more than 2400 m with two months of frost annually, over 100 mm of precipitation (periglacier conditions), and granite outcrops. The reconstruction of the past climate conditions indicated that the temperature in the cold Quaternary glacial age was 13 degrees lower than present, with glacier and periglacier conditions dominating. Under such conditions, the region's granites were extremely weathered, hence producing a large quantity of grain sediments. The surface run-offs or ice tongues drifted these sediments toward Lake Ernan (i.e. the present Ernan playa) and deposited them at its shoreline. After the lake and the main river dried up, southwest winds led the sediments of the lakeshore and the Tang-e-Chenar River upward to the top of the mountains, where sand ramps were, thus, formed. Due to the short formation duration and steady climate, no colluvial, alluvial material, or even soil (despite the large quantity of feldspars in the sand ramps) was traced amid the sediment layers of the sand ramps in the studied region. The only features traced there were slopes, alluvial debris and vegetation, indicating the dominance of warmer and moister climate as compared to the conditions at the time of formation. The directions of the past and developing sand ramps are similar but opposed to the prevailing and secondary wind of the region, indicating that it is the local winds which have formed those ramps.

C	Pelland, RJ; Gould, JS; Mallick, RB		Karakouzian, M		Pelland, RJ; Gould, JS; Mallick, RB			Selecting a rut resistant hot mix asphalt for Boston-Logan International Airport	AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS : CHALLENGES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES					Airfield Pavement Specialty Conference	SEP 21-24, 2003	Las Vegas, NV	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Transportat Dev Inst				Hot weather pavement rutting and moisture induced damage have become problematic on several taxiways and aprons that are subject to slow moving and standing aircraft loads at Logan International Airport in Boston, MA. The Massachusetts Port Authority is evaluating the performance of seven mix designs that are presently in service by the testing of field cores at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). Three mixes were tested for rutting and moisture susceptibility: a Trinidad Lake Asphalt (TLA)/latex modified P-401, a PG 64-28 P-401, and Densiphalt(R), a semi-flexible pavement. Four mixes were selected for more extensive testing: a PG 76-28 modified P-401, a reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP)/latex modified P-401, a latex modified stone matrix asphalt (SMA), and a Rosphalt 50(TM) modified P-401. Laboratory studies included use of loaded wheel track tests for determination and comparison of rutting and moisture induced damage at 60degreesC (140degreesF); determination of resilient modulus with the universal testing machine (UTM); determination of volumetric properties; and determination of the high temperature PG rating of the binders. Results indicate that significant improvement in rutting resistance can be achieved by providing a higher performance grade asphalt, a modified binder, or coarser gradation. The modification of mix designs comes with an increased cost of production. Not surprisingly, the two most expensive mixes, Densiphalt(R) and Rosphalt 50(TM), tested very well; they may be most cost effective in locally troublesome areas. Based on Massport's field experience, Densiphalt(R), and probably Rosphalt 50(TM), must be installed on a very stable subbase. These mixes may thus be best suited as the wearing course of new construction as opposed to an overlay or inlay of existing pavements. The TLA mix shows good rut resistance in the laboratory, but is prone to cracking and susceptibility to moisture after four to five years of service. The PG 64-28 P-401 also proved to be susceptible to moisture. Both mixes are no longer used at Logan Airport. The RAP mix has performed very well in the field through two summers and tested well in the laboratory. The PG 76-28 and SMA mixes have shown slight indications of rutting in the field. These last three mixes are the least costly to produce and should be studied further. It is recommended that long-term field performance of these mixes be evaluated, and that accelerated loading and testing of these mixes be conducted. Using the results of this program, proper specifications and quality control tests can be developed for assuring design and construction of economical and stable mixes.

J	Verschuren, D; Tibby, J; Sabbe, K; Roberts, N				Verschuren, D; Tibby, J; Sabbe, K; Roberts, N			Effects of depth, salinity, and substrate on the invertebrate community of a fluctuating tropical lake	ECOLOGY												Salinity is generally considered to be the dominant environmental factor regulating aquatic community structure in hydrologically closed lakes and wetlands, but it is not well known whether community response to long-term trends in hydrological balance is driven primarily by the direct physiological effect of salinity stress or by the habitat restructuring that accompanies changes in lake level and salinity. Attempts to separate the effects of various environmental factors on invertebrate populations in shallow fluctuating lakes through field study are hampered by the typically large temporal and spatial variation in species abundances and the long time scale of climate-driven habitat restructuring relative to the period of study. We used paleolimnological techniques to document long-term dynamics of the benthic invertebrate community inhabiting a shallow fluctuating lake in Kenya where during the period similar to 1870-1991 lake depth fluctuated between 4 and 19 m, and lakewater conductivity between similar to 250 and 14000 mu S/cm. Analyses of sediment texture, plant macrofossils, and fossil diatom assemblages in a (210)Pb-dated sediment core were combined with historical lake-level data to reconstruct continuous records of past changes in salinity and the distribution of various types of benthic habitat. Fossil invertebrate faunas recovered from the same core comprised 58 species of Ostracoda, chydorid Cladocera, and Chironomidae, with 26 common species together accounting for >95% of the recovered fossils. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses of the faunal and environmental data revealed distinct species-specific responses to lake level, salinity, and papyrus-swamp development. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning showed that salinity and swamp development together explained 51% of the observed historical variation in benthic community composition, and that their effects were independent, In the univariate. analyses, six species (23%) showed a strong response to salinity. Nine species (35%) responded strongly to swamp development, which determines availability of submerged vegetated substrates and turbulence-free, littoral mud bottoms. Five species (19%) responded primarily to lake level, which affects the general distribution of sand and mud bottoms and the intensity of subaqueous spring discharge. The remaining six species (23%) showed no distinct pattern or correlation with the selected environmental factors. These results suggest that a significant portion of the documented correlation between salinity and invertebrate community structure along the full gradient of inland aquatic ecosystems may be an indirect effect of broad but diffuse relationships between salinity and the distribution of various types of benthic microhabitat. Decade-scale environmental change experienced by individual closed-basin lakes tends to remain limited to a relatively narrow portion of this gradient, where covariance between salinity and other ecological determinants may be weak. Therefore, local populations of benthic invertebrates will be regulated by the fluctuating availability of specific habitat and associated resources rather than by the limit of their osmoregulating capacity.

However, the effects of the stratification transition, including the stratified and de-stratified periods, on the changes in prokaryotic and viral communities and their interactions remain unclear. We conducted a monthly survey of the surface and deep layers of a large and deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan) for a year and analyzed the prokaryotic production and prokaryotic and viral community composition. Our analysis revealed that, in the surface layer, 19 prokaryotic species, accounting for approximately 40% of the total prokaryotic abundance, could potentially contribute to the majority of prokaryotic production, which is the highest during the summer and is suppressed by viruses. This suggests that a small fraction of prokaryotes and phages were the key infection pairs during the peak period of prokaryotic activity in the freshwater lake. We also found that approximately 50% of the dominant prokaryotic and viral species in the deep layer were present throughout the study period. This suggests that the "kill the winner" model could explain the viral impact on prokaryotes in the surface layer, but other dynamics may be at play in the deep layer. Furthermore, we found that annual vertical mixing could result in a similar rate of community change between the surface and deep layers. These findings may be valuable in understanding how communities and the interaction among them change when freshwater lake stratification is affected by global warming in the future.IMPORTANCEViral infection associated with prokaryotic production occurs in a density- or frequency-dependent manner and regulates the prokaryotic community. Stratification transition and annual vertical mixing in freshwater lakes are known to affect the prokaryotic community and the interaction between prokaryotes and viruses. By pairing measurements of virome analysis and prokaryotic production of a 1-year survey of the depths of surface and deep layers, we revealed (i) the prokaryotic infection pairs associated with prokaryotic production and (ii) the reset in prokaryotic and viral communities through annual vertical mixing in a freshwater lake. Our results provide a basis for future work into changes in stratification that may impact the biogeochemical cycling in freshwater lakes.

J	Irwin, RP II; Howard, AD; Maxwell, TA				Irwin, RP II; Howard, AD; Maxwell, TA			Geomorphology of Ma'adim Vallis, Mars, and associated paleolake basins - art. no. E12009	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Ma'adim Vallis, one of the largest valleys in the Martian highlands, appears to have originated by catastrophic overflow of a large paleolake located south of the valley heads. Ma'adim Vallis debouched to Gusev crater, 900 km to the north, the landing site for the Spirit Mars Exploration Rover. Support for the paleolake overflow hypothesis comes from the following characteristics: (1) With a channel width of 3 km at its head, Ma'adim Vallis originates at two (eastern and western) gaps incised into the divide of the similar to1.1 M km(2) enclosed Eridania head basin, which suggests a lake as the water source. (2) The sinuous course of Ma'adim Vallis is consistent with overland flow controlled by preexisting surface topography, and structural control is not evident or required to explain the valley course. (3) The nearly constant similar to5 km width of the inner channel through crater rim breaches, the anastomosing course of the wide western tributary, the migration of the inner channel to the outer margins of bends in the valley's lower reach, a medial sedimentary bar similar to200 m in height, and a step-pool sequence are consistent with modeled flows of 1-5 x 10(6) m(3)/s. Peak discharges were likely higher but are poorly constrained by the relict channel geometry. (4) Small direct tributary valleys to Ma'adim Vallis have convex-up longitudinal profiles, suggesting a hanging relationship to a valley that was incised quickly relative to the timescales of tributary development. (5) The Eridania basin had adequate volume between the initial divide and the incised gap elevations to carve Ma'adim Vallis during a single flood. (6) The Eridania basin is composed of many overlapping, highly degraded and deeply buried impact craters. The floor materials of the six largest craters have an unusually high internal relief (similar to1 km) and slope (similar to0.5-1.5degrees) among degraded Martian craters, which are usually flat-floored. Long-term, fluvial sediment transport appears to have been inhibited within these craters, and the topography is inconsistent with basaltic infilling. (7) Fluvial valleys do not dissect the slopes of these deeper crater floor depressions, unlike similar slopes that are dissected at higher levels in the watershed. These characteristics (6, 7) suggest that water mantled at least the lower parts of the Eridania basin floor throughout the period of relatively intense erosion early in Martian history. The lake level increased and an overflow occurred near the close of the Noachian (age determined using >5 km crater counts). Initially, the Eridania basin debouched northward at two locations into the intermediate basin, a highly degraded impact crater similar to500 km in diameter. As this intermediate basin was temporarily filled with water, erosion took place first along the lower (northern) reach of Ma'adim Vallis, debouching to Gusev crater. The western overflow point was later abandoned, and erosion of the intermediate basin interior was concentrated along the eastern pathway. Subsequent air fall deposition, impact gardening, tectonism, and limited fluvial erosion modified the Eridania basin region, so evidence for a paleolake is restricted to larger landforms that could survive post-Noachian degradation processes.

Altaf			Impacts of Drought on Water Fluxes and Water-Use Efficiency in an Age-Sequence of Temperate Conifer Forests	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Evapotranspiration (ET) from temperate forests plays a significant role in the regional and global water cycles. However, extreme weather events such as heat and drought are affecting the water use and water use efficiency (WUE) of these forests. Climate change impacts may be more severe in plantation forests where the age of the forest plays a significant role, causing differences in their responses to environmental stresses. This study presents 14 years (2008-2021) of water flux data measured using the eddy covariance technique in an age sequence (83, 48 and 20 years as of 2021) of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) forests in the Great Lakes region in southern Ontario, Canada. The mean annual ET was 465 +/- 41, 466 +/- 32 and 403 +/- 21 mm year-1 in the 83-, 48- and 20-year-old stands, respectively, with the highest annual water flux observed in the 83-year- old stand, which was similar to that of the 48-year-old stand. Mean annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was 1585 +/- 100, 1660 +/- 115 and 1634 +/- 331 g C m-2 year-1in the 83-, 48- and 20-year-old stands, respectively, while mean annual WUE was 3.4 +/- 0.4, 3.6 +/- 0.4 and 4.0 +/- 0.8 g C kg H2O year-1 in the respective stands. Lower ET and relatively higher GEP resulted in the highest WUE in the youngest stand, even though the highest GEP was observed in the middle-aged stand. Air temperature (Tair) was the dominant control on ET, GEP and WUE in all three different-aged stands, while drought, characterised as the relative extractable water (REW) in the soil, had a significant impact on ET in the late summer. The results of this study further showed that forest age significantly influenced how forests responded to drought stresses. The younger stand was more efficient in carbon sequestration and water use despite exhibiting greater sensitivity to water stress and higher drought coupling. The long-term eddy covariance measurements analysed in this study have helped to enhance our understanding of water exchange processes in the temperate conifer forest ecosystems in Eastern North America. Specifically, this work contributes to a better understanding of how different-aged forests respond to extreme weather events, aiding in the development of new strategies for managing water resources and ensuring water security in the region under a changing climate.

Variations in abiotic and biotic conditions in different ecosystems may further influence resource availability and habitat utilisation, potentially reducing competition. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of environmental variation on spatial and trophic niche overlap between two freshwater apex predators, the northern pike (Esox lucius) and the European catfish (Silurus glanis), in three different water bodies.MethodsWe used fine-scale acoustic telemetry to assess the spatial niche overlap of pike and catfish, analyzing their spatial and habitat use in relation to the thermocline and their presence in benthic versus open-water habitats. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) was used to quantify trophic niche overlap and dietary differences between the species. We compared the habitat use, spatial niche width and overlap, and trophic differentiation among waterbodies to determine how environmental conditions influence predator interactions.ResultsDuring summer, pike and catfish primarily occupied benthic habitats above the thermocline across all waterbodies and diel periods. However, catfish more frequently used open water above the thermocline, while pike were more often present in both open water and benthic habitats below it. While this general pattern of habitat use was consistent, its extent varied among lakes, suggesting that local environmental conditions shape species-specific habitat selection. Despite these variations, the species exhibited substantial spatial overlap, though its magnitude fluctuated across waterbodies and diel periods. Catfish occupied a broader spatial niche in two waterbodies, while pike had a broader niche in one. Across all lakes, catfish consistently maintained a broader trophic niche than pike. However, pike exhibited higher trophic overlap with catfish than vice versa, with nearly complete overlap in one lake and substantial but incomplete overlap in others. This suggests that pike relies more heavily on shared prey resources, while catfish exploits a broader range of food sources beyond those used by pike.These patterns were primarily driven by the position of the thermocline, prey availability, structural complexity and the greater foraging plasticity of catfish, highlighting the environmental dependence of niche partitioning in these predators.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that spatial and trophic niche overlaps between pike and catfish are highly context-dependent, shaped by abiotic conditions, prey availability, and species-specific foraging strategies. This study highlights the importance of integrating spatial and trophic analyses to understand predator interactions in aquatic ecosystems.

J	Sand-Jensen, K; Riis, T; Martinsen, KT				Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Riis, Tenna; Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro			Photosynthesis, growth, and distribution of plants in lowland streams-A synthesis and new data analyses of 40 years research	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												This paper synthesises insights and offers new quantitative analyses of data gathered during 40 years of stream research by Danish researchers and international associates. Lowland Danish streams mostly drain fertile cropland and contain high nutrient concentrations saturating maximum yield and growth rate of plants. Concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are variable, although usually high, supporting a range of wetland and permanently submerged species. All terrestrial and most amphibious species are obligate CO2 users, while the majority of permanently submerged species can supplement their inorganic carbon demand with bicarbonate. In lake outlets, the average CO2 concentration was close to air saturation during summer, whereas sites with no lake influence were 9-fold supersaturated. The 20% increase of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the past 40 years has marginal influence on CO2 concentrations in the streams. In lake outlets with low CO2 concentrations, calculations on 33 stream species showed essentially no underwater photosynthesis by temporarily submerged terrestrial species, low rates by amphibious species, and high rates by permanently submerged bicarbonate users. Underwater photosynthetic rates increased at sites with high CO2 concentrations (no lake influence): they were lowest for terrestrial wetland species (mean 1.8 mg O-2 g dry weight(-1) hr(-1)), followed by homophyllous (3.0) and heterophyllous amphibious species (5.6), and highest among permanently submerged species (15.0). Terrestrial and amphibious species grew very slowly when CO2 levels were low, but rapidly in CO2 rich water, or when in contact with air above the water's surface. Decreasing CO2 concentrations from upstream to downstream caused lower photosynthesis rates of amphibious species, while photosynthesis by bicarbonate users was consistently high. The relative abundance of terrestrial and amphibious species decreased significantly as CO2 resources decline from upstream to downstream, while the abundance of permanently submerged species increased as streams progressed. However, plant abundance as a function of CO2 concentrations did not differ markedly among the plant groups. We conclude that photosynthesis and growth of species of different plant types under controlled experimental conditions resembling high in situ nutrient availability are closely related to inorganic carbon supplies, while their representation in plant assemblages is influenced by the spatially and temporally highly diverse ecological conditions from upstream to downstream in the mostly CO2-rich lowland streams. Submerged terrestrial and amphibious species restricted to CO2 use for photosynthesis can partly escape the slow gas diffusion under water by growing in very CO2-rich streams and having apical leaves in contact with air. Thus, strong restrictions on their growth and existence should be identified at sites where CO2 concentrations are consistently low and no air contact is possible, while co-limitation by nutrients is likely to be marginal. Generally, rising atmospheric CO2 is irrelevant to photosynthesis of permanently submerged plants because of their ability to use bicarbonate and the high CO2 supersaturation in most stream sites. In contrast, photosynthesis and growth of amphibious and terrestrial plants under water are highly dependent on CO2 concentrations varying from close to air saturation in lake outlets to supersaturation in headwaters.					; Riis, Tenna/AAE-4115-2020	Martinsen, Kenneth Thoro/0000-0001-8064-513X; Riis, Tenna/0000-0003-2501-4444													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2022	67	7					1255	1271		10.1111/fwb.13915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13915		MAY 2022											WOS:000800213200001
J	HELVACI, C				HELVACI, C			STRATIGRAPHY, MINERALOGY, AND GENESIS OF THE BIGADIC BORATE DEPOSITS, WESTERN TURKEY	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												The Bigadic borates are the largest colemanite and ulexite deposits in the world and the high-grade colemanite and ulexite ores (30 and 29% B2O3, respectively) should supply a substantial proportion of the world's needs for many years. The Bigadic deposits formed within Neogene perennial saline lakes sediments located in a northeast-southwest-trending basin. The volcano-sedimentary sequence in the deposits consists of (from bottom to top) basement volcanics, lower limestone, lower tuff, lower borate zone, upper tuff, upper borate zone, and olivine basalt. The borate deposits formed under arid conditions in perennial saline lakes fed by hyrdrothermal springs associated with local volcanic activity. The deposits are interbedded with tuffs, clays, and limestones. Borate minerals formed in two zones separated by thick tuff beds that have been transformed to montmorillonite, chlorite, and zeolites (mainly heulandite) during diagenesis. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both borate zones, but other borates, including howlite, probertite, and hydroboracite are present in the lower borate zone; whereas inyoite, meyerhofferite, pandermite, tertschite (?), hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite, and rivadavite are found in the upper borate zone. Calcite, anhydrite, gypsum, celestite, K feldspar, analcime, heulandite, clinoptilolite, quartz, opal-CT, montmorillonite, chlorite, and illite are also found in the deposit. Colemanite nodules in both borate zones probably formed directly from solution, within unconsolidated sediments just below the sediment-water interface, and continued to grow as the sediments were compacted. It is unlikely that the colemanite formed by dehydration of inyoite and/or by replacement of ulexite after burial. Later generations of colemanite and ulexite are found in vugs and veins and as fibrous margins of early formed nodules. Other diagenetic changes include the partial replacement of colemanite by howlite and hydroboracite and ulexite by tunellite. Nodular-shaped colemanite and ulexite minerals predominate in both borate zones. Colemanite and ulexite show alternating horizons, and the transformation of one mineral to another has not been observed and the boundary between them is always sharp. Because these minerals are readily dissolved, secondary pure and transparent colemanite and ulexie are often encountered in cavities of nodules and cracks. Some colemanite and ulexite is weathered and completely replaced by calcite. Probertite bands are found in some ulexite horizons, especially in the lower borate zone. It forms in the same chemical environment as ulexite and indicates a period of more extreme desiccation and possibly subaerial exposure within the lakes. Euhedral tunellite formed during dissolution and recrystallization of some Sr-rich ulexite horizons. In the Bigadic deposits, hydroboracite formed by replacement of colemanite, with Mg2+ ions supplied from adjacent tuffs and clays by ion exchange. Howlite grew in clays alternating with thin colemanite bands and coincided with periods of relatively high Si concentrations. Diagenetic processes also produced small howlite nodules embedded in unconsolidated colemanite nodules. The initial solutions that formed the alkaline perennial saline lake(s) were low in Cl- and SQ(4)(2-) and high in boron and Ca2+, with subordinate Na+.																			0361-0128					AUG	1995	90	5					1237	1260		10.2113/gsecongeo.90.5.1237	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.90.5.1237													WOS:A1995TH19400012
J	Martín, PR; Estebenet, AL; Burela, S				Martín, PR; Estebenet, AL; Burela, S			Factors affecting the distribution and abundance of the commensal Temnocephala iheringi (Platyhelminthes:Temnocephalidae) among the southernmost populations of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata (Mollusca:Ampullariidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temnocephala iheringi is the most common temnocephalan inhabiting the mantle cavity of the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, a freshwater neotropical gastropod that has become a serious rice pest in Southeastern Asia. T. iheringi has been recorded from Mato Grosso (Brazil) to water bodies associated with the Rio de la Plata river (Argentina). During an extensive survey in the southern limit of the native area of P. canaliculata the presence of T. iheringi eggs was recorded in several apple snail populations, extending the known distribution of the commensal more than 400 kin southwards. The aim of this study was to understand the factors affecting the distribution and abundance of T. iheringi among populations of P. canaliculata. Only 23% of the apple snail populations inhabiting streams harboured temnocephalans while the occurrence among lentic ones was 71%. T. iheringi was found mostly in populations of apple snails living in non-alkaline sites and where snails attaining sizes larger than 4 cm were very common. The prevalence of the temnocephalans in lentic populations was higher than 90%. The number of eggs on the shell (not including the umbilicus) ranged between 0 and 470 and was different among populations of P. canaliculata. The prevalence and number of eggs were lower in the lotic populations, except for a stream population immediately downstream of a lake with commensals. There was no difference between males and females of P. canaliculata neither in the prevalence nor in the number of eggs on the shell. The southernmost population of the world of P. canaliculata harbours commensals that tolerate cold winter water temperatures (4-5 degrees C) as well as its host. On the other hand, T. iheringi was found only in sites with bicarbonate concentrations lower than 6.6 meq l(-1), suggesting that the tolerance of the commensal is very much lower than that of the apple snail (up to 9.95 meq l(-1)). The number of worms inside each snail or the life history variation of P. canaliculata could explain the influence of the size of the snails on the occurrence of T. iheringi. In the big-sized snails, where the number of commensals is higher, the probability of survival of at least one worm is also higher, specialty during the hibernation period, when crawling and feeding are null and snails remain buried. On the other hand, P. canaliculata snails from lentic populations are generally bigger and mostly iteroparous, while those inhabiting streams are smaller and semelparous. In these populations the snails have access to mate only with snails of their same cohort, while in iteroparous populations they can copulate with individuals of other cohorts, allowing the inter-generation transmission of worms and the long term persistence of the population of commensals.

J	Lewy, Z				Lewy, Zeev			Genesis: early life survived in the Polar Circles by precipitating banded iron formation (∼ 3.7-1.85 Ga) followed by stratified ferruginous siliciclasts until ∼ 580 Ma, when tectonically shifted to lower latitudes initiating the 'Cambrian Explosion'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The inclination of Planet Earth's axis of rotation by 231/2 degrees resulted in extreme climatic changes. Weak, solar radiation upon the Polar Circles during half-a-year alternated with half-a-year of darkness, turning them into freezing terrains for nearly the whole Precambrian. Exhalant hydrothermal solutions formed huge lakes over Polar Regions, undergoing intensive evaporation and condensation. Chemical interactions incidentally created primitive live forms, surviving as chemoautotrophic bacteria under the weakest UV rays. Daily changing solar radiation emitting UV rays over low latitudes prevented any life form. Some of these polar bacteria developed photosynthesis, improving their nourishment simultaneously releasing oxygen. The high content of ferrous iron in the lakes absorbed toxic oxygen forming iron oxides as banded iron formation (BIF). Excess photosynthetic oxygen molecules escaped into the anoxic atmosphere. At similar to 1.8 Ga oxygenated meteoric water infiltrated the continental subsurface oxidizing hydrothermal fluids, precipitating underground layered iron-oxides followed by silica only during the dry summers. The dilution of the rising solutions terminated biologically induced BIF precipitation. Consequently, intensive evaporation cemented sililiciclasts into stratified ferruginous formations, becoming abundant in the Late Neoproterozoic as NIF. The co-occurrence of Paleoproterozoic BIF and Neoproterozoic NIF sites evidence the tectonic and climatic stability of the Polar Circles. Magmatic convection currents split them similar to 750 Ma ago, but only after 580 Ma shifted the individual plates radially to low latitudes with advance of 'Plate Tectonics'. The polar bacteria connected with the open sterile sea for the first time had to adapt to daily changing ecosystems by combining into mobile primitive eukaryotes (Ediacaran Biota) and further diversify, erroneously referred to the 'Cambrian Explosion'. Geological evidence corroborated the activity of convection currents since Earth's consolidation controlling its inner heat budget and supplying hydrothermal solutions forming lakes on the Polar Circles where life originated and iron ores accumulated.																			1437-3254	1437-3262				JUL	2022	111	5					1593	1607		10.1007/s00531-022-02194-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-022-02194-1		MAY 2022											WOS:000797265100001

The identification results of the ostracod and charophyta fossils from the four samples at this horizon show the following results: 1. All the samples contain 458 ostracod fossil valves, belonging to six genera and eight species. Their quantity (valves) and percentage, in descending order of abundance, are Candoniella albicans (Brady), 255/55.68%, Ilyocypris bradyi Sars, 73/15.94%, Eucypris inflata Sars, 46/10.04%, Cyclocypris serena Koch, 26/5.68%, Candona kirgizica Mandelstam, 18/3.93%, Ilyocypris biplicata (Koch), 17/3.71%, Candoniella mirabilis Schneider14/3.06% and Leucocytherella sinensis Huang, 6/1.31%. 2. All the samples contain 99 fossil charophyte gyrogonites, belonging to one genera and four species. In terms of quantity/percentage, the Chara sp. is the most abundant, with 41 pieces (41.41%), followed by Chara braunii Gemlin, with 26 pieces (26.26%); Chara leptosperma Braun and Chara canescens Loiseleur account for 19 pieces (19.19%) and 13 pieces (13.13%), respectively. Based on the analysis of the ecological environment of the existing species of these ostracods and charophytes, combined with the fossilized Ilyocypris brady, Ilyocypris biplicata, and Gyraulus convexiusculus Hutton found in all the samples-which indicate very warm, even subtropical climates then-it can be concluded that during the Qin and Han Dynasties, the Salawusu River Basin was primarily characterized by a freshwater lake environment under a warm climate, with the average annual temperature and precipitation in this area approximately 2.1 degrees C and 100 mm higher than they are currently. The prevailing East Asian summer monsoon pushed the warm temperate climate at least 110 km northwestward from this basin. During this period, there were at least four episodes of brief subtropical climate fluctuations, occurring approximately every 110 years.

The lake, with an area of similar to 1 km(2), is situated at the foot of the world's northernmost active subaerial volcano and is separated from the sea by a 150-240 m wide beach barrier, which reaches 4-5 m above sea level. Most of the lake is deeper than 25 m, with the deepest part being 36 m. Altogether five coring sites, evenly spread out, were chosen and the sediment cores were retrieved from the lake ice with Uwitec and Nesje corers. After detailed descriptions of the very organic-poor and silt dominated sediments (of supposedly tephradominated origin), three sites were chosen for further analyses: macrofossils for C-14 dating, tephra chemistry, C, S, grain-size, and XRF analyses. Based on C-14 dates and the occurrence of the so-called Eggoya tephra (AD 1732), age models show variable bottom ages for the three sites: similar to 3000, 600 and 400 cal yr BP. Due to the position of the core sites, with different sediment source areas, the elemental signals vary considerably between sites. An interesting feature of the lake is an isolated stock of Arctic char, which shows that the now land-locked lake has once been in contact with the sea. The almost total lack of organic material excluded any advanced paleoecologic investigations of the lake, and the study therefore focused on its marine-limnic history by different examinations of the XRF data with focus on the oldest and longest record. This development is based on elemental ratios (Br/Zn), PCA analyses of a center log ratio (clr) transformation of the original XRF data and magnetic susceptibility. It shows that the lake was isolated just before the time of the Eggoya tephra fall-out (similar to 220 cal yr BP), when the stock of Arctic char was most likely isolated from the sea. This was preceded by a similar to 2200 yr long period of marine bay with a more or less open connection with the sea, and thus varying freshwater impact. Between similar to 2400 and 2600 cal yr BP the basin was more or less isolated, preceded by almost full marine conditions for at least the 300-400 preceding years we have data from, a period when relative sea level might have been higher.

However, the below-cloud evaporation effect remains poorly quantified under current warming-wetting climate changes in the Tanggula Mountains, a typical climatic transition zone of the central Tibetan Plateau (TP); thus, its temporal trends and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we combined long-term observations on precipitation stable isotopes and meteorological data with the Stewart model to estimate sub-cloud evaporation and determine its influence on precipitation isotopes in the Tanggula Mountains. The annual weighted mean of the remaining raindrop fraction was estimated at 88.1%, and a significant increasing trend was observed at the annual scale, which indicates a progressive weakening of the below-cloud evaporation intensity in this region. Significant isotope modifications in precipitation were observed during the descent from the cloud base to ground, with delta 18O increasing by 2.6%o and dexcess decreasing by 9.8%o. This indicated that below-cloud evaporation contributed to a noticeable enrichment of heavy stable isotope in precipitation in the central TP. For every 1% increase in the remaining raindrop fraction, the triangle delta 18O value decreased by 0.2%o and triangle d value increased by 0.63%o. However, the below-cloud evaporation of precipitation in the central TP was notably weaker than that of the regions surrounding the TP. This phenomenon can be attributed to the widespread presence of lakes and wetlands, influence of the Indian Summer Monsoon, and cold-wet island effects of the cryosphere in the central TP. These factors create distinct cold-humid climate conditions that effectively suppress below-cloud evaporation. The random forest model further demonstrated that relative humidity plays a dominant role in regulating below-cloud evaporation processes. Therefore, current climatic warming and wetting will likely further weaken the below-cloud evaporation of precipitation in the region. The findings of this study provide a critical scientific basis for paleoclimatic reconstruction and water resource management in the central TP.					汪, 汪少勇/IZE-6216-2023; Shi, Xiao/JAN-7908-2023	Wang, Shaoyong/0000-0002-9772-6304; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	663		B						134300	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134300													WOS:001589353400001
J	Muraviev, AY; Chernov, RA				Muraviev, A. Ya.; Chernov, R. A.			Outburst of the Spartakovskoye Glacier-Dammed Lake and Changes of the Outlet Glacier of the Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky Ice Cap, Severnaya Zemlya in 2021	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												In the second half of August 2021, outburst flood from the Spartakovskoe Lake, one of the largest glacier -dammed lakes in the Russian sector of the Arctic, occurred on the Bolshevik Island (the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago). The lake hollow was drained. The volume of water discharged from the lake into the Spartak fjord was about 376 +/- 21 mln. m3. Only 5 years have passed since the last outburst of the lake in August 2016. The lake hollow was filled with water faster than in the period 2006-2016. The volume of runoff into the lake increased significantly due to more intensive surface ablation on the glaciers of the drainage basin during the anomalously warm summers in 2018-2021. For the up-floating of the ice dam restraining the lake overflow-ing, the height of the water edge in the lake before the outburst should have been about 113 m. Compared to the state of 2016, the maximum possible water level in the lake has dropped by about 10 m. That was a result of lowering of the glacier surface and, accordingly, a decrease in the thickness of the dam ice. The cartograph-ic method was used to find a location of the area of the greatest depression of the dam surface, the occurrence was conditioned by the development of the under-ice runoff channel in 2016. It can be assumed that during the lake outburst in the second half of August 2021, its location was approximately the same as in 2016. The water level in the lake will no longer be able to rise to the watershed with the Bazovaya River basin (123 m). The flow from the lake to the Bazovaya River is now impossible. The glacial-dammed Lake Spartakovskoe is now a part of only the Kara Sea basin. Under the present-day climatic conditions, the surface of the ice dam decreases and, accordingly, the volume of runoff into the lake increases. In the future, this will probably result in more frequent outburst of the lake, a decrease in its volume, and accordingly, a reduction of the water vol-ume discharging into the lake.

However, future changes in southern African precipitation are uncertain, with climate models showing a wide range of responses from near-term projections (2020-2040) to the end of the 21st century (2080-2100). Here, we assess the uncertainty in southern African precipitation change using five Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation single model initial-condition large ensembles (30-50 ensemble members) and four emissions scenarios. We show that the main source of uncertainty in 21st Century projections of southern African precipitation is the internal climate variability. In addition, we find that differences between ensemble members in simulating future changes in the location of the Angola Low explain a large proportion (similar to 60%) of the uncertainty in precipitation change. Together, the internal variations in the large-scale circulation over the Pacific Ocean and the Angola Low explain similar to 64% of the uncertainty in southern African precipitation change. We suggest that a better understanding of the future evolutions of the southern African precipitation may be achieved by understanding better the model's ability to simulate the Angola Low and its effects on precipitation. The variability of precipitation in southern Africa has a strong impact on local communities, rain-fed agriculture, food security and water demand, hydropower production, lake levels, ecosystems, and wildlife. Above-average rainfall increases the risk of flooding, while below-average rainfall increases the risk of drought. However, future changes in precipitation in southern Africa are poorly understood. Here, we examine the potential sources of uncertainty in southern African precipitation change using five ocean-atmosphere general circulation single-model initial-condition large ensembles and four emissions scenarios. We show that the main source of uncertainty is the simulation of internal climate variability throughout the 21st century. Among potential drivers, we show that the main driver of uncertainty in southern African precipitation change is the future change in the location of the Angola low. A future northward (southward) shift of the Angola Low is associated with a future decrease (increase) in southern African precipitation. We suggest that a better understanding of future changes in southern African precipitation could be achieved by better understanding the impact of internal climate variability on the Angola Low.

Here, we quantitatively reconstruct high-resolution temperature and precipitation sequences since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by applying the weighted averaging partial least squares (WAPLS) model to the pollen record from Daye Lake in the Taibai Mountains, the main peak of the Qinling Mountain Range. The results show a distinct vegetation succession: the transition from coniferous forest to coniferous-broadleaf mixed forest, and ultimately to deciduous broadleaf forest, with a progressive increase in open land coverage during the late Holocene. The climate during the LGM was characterized by approximately 4 degrees C lower temperature and about 300 mm less precipitation compared to the Holocene, and then the temperature and precipitation continuously increased from the late deglacial to the early Holocene, reaching the maximum (temperature of 9.9 degrees C; precipitation of 940 mm) in the mid-Holocene. This warm and humid phase was followed by a cooling and drying trend in the late Holocene. A synthesis of hydrological and temperature records demonstrates that the reconstructed temperature changes were consistent with other temperature records from both the EASM domain and the broader Northern Hemisphere, reflecting a regional signal. However, the reconstructed precipitation data revealed distinct patterns specific to the Qinling region: precipitation changes during the last deglacial period exhibited a homological pattern with records from southern China, while aligning closely with the trends observed in northern China over the Holocene. Millennial-scale precipitation changes during the 16-12 cal kyr BP were modulated by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Kuroshio Current (KC) intensity. The north-south precipitation dipole pattern in the Holocene is linked to the positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which are modulated by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity. Both pollen-based reconstructed climate results using the WAPLS model from Daye Lake and CMIP6 multi-model ensemble simulations in the Qinling region suggest that future precipitation will likely increase with rising temperatures, providing critical insights into the response of the EASM to ongoing global warming.

However, there is no geological record of hydrological changes in lakes in the Ross Sea region. Here we used analyses of surface lake sediment and living microbial mats to show that photoautotrophic organism-derived lipid hydrogen isotopes reflected the S2H values of lake water (S2Hwater). We present a new record of S2Hlipids from two lacustrine sediment cores collected from Inexpressible Island in the western Ross Sea to reconstruct S2Hwater values over the past 3000 years. The reconstructed S2Hwater values range from-103 to-35 parts per thousand, and are significantly higher than S2Hwater values of precipitation (snow). On the basis of our modern observations, the slope of the linear regression between S2H and S18O in lake water is lower than both global and Antarctic meteoric water lines, suggesting strong lake evaporation at our study region. Our sensitivity modeling experiment showed that the strength of evaporation is closely linked with summer air temperature. Furthermore, S2Hlipids showed similar patterns in variations with regional air temperature recorded by ice cores in the western Ross Sea, indicating that lake surface evaporation is mainly driven by air temperature. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) on S2Hlipids and published climate records in the western Ross Sea indicate that higher S2HC16 values are corresponding to a relatively warmer climate at 2550-1350 cal yr BP (Phase 2) while lower values (corresponding to a relatively colder climate) are found at 3000-2550 cal yr BP (Phase 1) and 1350-0 cal yr BP (Phase 3). Higher lake evaporation was caused by the incursion of warm and moist air into the western Ross Sea as mediated by anomalous high-pressure over the Amundsen Sea that often occurs during the El Nino-dominant events. Our study supports the notion that large-scale atmospheric variability controlled by the tropical Pacific plays a major role in hydrological changes in the high latitude regions of Antarctica.

The mean annual precipitation (MAP) of a closed-basin lake can be estimated by the energy-water balance model (EWBM). The EWBM can be divided into linear and nonlinear models, with determination of evaporation over water and land surface being the main components. However, the influence of vegetation changes on different models and the potential of the models to reconstruct vegetation remain unclear. Dali Lake, a closed-basin lake in the marginal region of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), is selected as the study region to test the feasibility of a new algorithm, i.e., the comparative method. This method is performed by comparing the reconstructed MAPs given by linear and nonlinear models for each stepwise reduced or increased forest fraction until both MAPs are approximately equal within the error range. The results indicate that the linear model is more sensitive to vegetation changes than the nonlinear model; however, both linear and nonlinear models can obtain the modern MAP correctly. Additionally, the comparative method can successfully determine the vegetation cover. Using the reported paleolake levels of Dali Lake, we calculate the Holocene MAP and vegetation of the Dali Lake basin. The results show that the early and middle Holocene MAP obtained by the comparative method is similar to 10 mm higher than that obtained by the nonlinear model, while the difference in the late Holocene is not insignificant. The reconstructed vegetation is generally consistent with the pollen-indicated vegetation changes in the Dali Lake region and the monsoon marginal zone in North China. Our study suggests that both linear and nonlinear models can provide reliable MAP values for basins with known vegetation. For basins with unknown vegetation, the nonlinear model with variable parameters or the more advantageous comparative method preferred. In cases where the basin mainly consists of two vegetation types, the comparative method enables to reconstruct the fraction of two vegetation types.

We conducted a 2-D Deep Electrical Resistivity Tomography (DERT) survey in Taylor Valley, Antarctica, to image the distribution of permafrost, its thicknesses, lower boundaries, and hydrogeology. Results show resistive, discontinuous domains that we suggest represent permafrost units. We also find highly conductive layers (5-10 ohm<middle dot>m), between 300-350 m and 600-650 m below ground level and a shallower (similar to 50-100 m depth) conductive layer. The combined data set reveals a broad brine system in Taylor Valley, implying multi-tiered groundwater circulation: a shallow, localized system linked with surface water bodies and a separate deeper, regional circulation system. The arrangement of these brines across different levels, coupled with the uneven permafrost distribution, underscores potential interplay between the two systems. Permafrost (perennially frozen ground) and its increasing thaw is a key indicator of climate change. The gradual increase of global temperature accelerates permafrost thawing at high latitudes, resulting in enhanced carbon release into the atmosphere, ultimately exacerbating global warming. During the austral summer of 2020, we conducted an electrical resistivity survey in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, to map the thickness of permafrost, determine its lower boundaries and identify the presence and connectivity of saline groundwater at depth. The ice-free Dry Valleys are the only place in Antarctica where it is possible to study the permafrost directly. Results show a complex distribution of permafrost, with layers of saline groundwater at different levels. We recognized two distinct zones: one of low resistivity around Lake Fryxell, related to the presence of two systems of brines at different depths, and the other displaying typical ice-rich frozen ground resistivity values near Coral Ridge. These findings reveal variations in permafrost thickness and brine depth along the valley, both horizontally and vertically. Our research identifies a multi-level groundwater circulation system: a shallow, local network, connected to surface water bodies like Lake Fryxell, above a deeper, regional system. Resistivity data show a complex hydrogeological scenario, with uneven permafrost distribution and different levels of brines Results show a multi-tiered system of groundwater circulation of brines: a shallow system connected to the surface and a deeper regional system Observations are consistent with a model of upwelling of over pressured deep brines enhancing permafrost thawing from beneath					; Florindo, Fabio/F-4119-2010; Romano, Valentina/MIK-7283-2025; Wilson, Gary/B-3803-2010; Sciarra, Alessandra/J-4752-2017; Mazzini, Adriano/HOH-3443-2023; Mazzoli, Claudio/H-9651-2015; Ruggiero, Livio/CAF-0577-2022	Romano, Valentina/0000-0001-7558-0474; Fischanger, Federico/0000-0001-8151-7957; Ruggiero, Livio/0000-0002-0779-7214; Florindo, Fabio/0000-0002-6058-9748; Mazzini, Adriano/0000-0003-0913-8682; Sciarra, Alessandra/0000-0003-3767-3105; Mazzoli, Claudio/0000-0002-0374-8415; Wilson, Gary/0000-0003-0025-3641; Anderson, Jacob/0000-0002-4329-4200; Worthington, Rachel/0000-0002-0164-126X													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2024	51	18							e2023GL106912	10.1029/2023GL106912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL106912													WOS:001313067600001

The Aksug Porphyry Cu-Mo Deposit (Northeastern Tuva): Chronology of Magmatism and Ore Formation Processes (U-Pb and Re-Os Isotope Data) and Metallogenic Implications	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												The Aksug porphyry Cu-Mo deposit is located in a region of long-lasting magmatic activity. Gabbroids of the Khoito-Oka complex are the earliest intrusive rocks, in which the Aksug granitoid pluton hosting ore-bearing small porphyry intrusions is localized. The intrusive activity was terminated with emplacement of late leucogranite dikes. There are different viewpoints on the age of magmatism and mineralization of the Aksug deposit, with the concept of their Devonian age prevailing. To solve the debatable issue, we performed isotope geochronological studies and analyzed new results of U-Pb (SHRIMP-II) zircon dating and previously published Re-Os molybdenite dates (518 +/- 2, 516 +/- 2, and 511 +/- 2 Ma). The concordant U-Pb zircon ages for igneous rocks are younger than the Re-Os age for mineralization. New U-Pb dating of Khoito-Oka gabbro-diorites has yielded an age of 503 +/- 2 Ma. The U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of tonalites from the Aksug pluton has been estimated at 504 +/- 5 Ma. The U-Pb zircon ages for ore-related tonalite porphyry I and tonalite porphyry II are 500 +/- 6 and 499 +/- 6 Ma, respectively. The obtained SHRIMP age for leucogranite dike is 509 +/- 14 Ma. Two groups of U-Pb dates have been obtained for each of the analyzed zircon samples: close to the Re-Os dates (518-511 +/- 2 Ma) and younger (507-486 Ma). The weighted average zircon ages calculated for early and late populations from post-ore leucogranites are 515 +/- 4 and 500 +/- 4 Ma, respectively. We suggest that zircons with an age close to the Re-Os dates found in post-ore leucogranites were assimilated from the underlying substrate and zircons with an age of 500 +/- 4 Ma crystallized from melt. The oldest U-Pb dates (509-515 Ma) of individual zircon grains from ore-bearing tonalite porphyry are consistent with the Re-Os molybdenite ages. Zircons from tonalite, tonalite porphyry, and Khoito-Oka gabbroids sometimes show internal textures indicating secondary alteration. The younger U-Pb concordia zircon ages relative to the Re-Os dates might be due to the influence of late thermal processes on the U-Pb isotopic system. The younger dates (486-507 Ma) of individual zircon grains probably reflect the time of the impact of a thermal fluid process. The weighted average of these younger dates (502 +/- 2 Ma) falls within the weighted average age of post-ore leucogranites (500 +/- 4 Ma). According to the Re-Os dates, the Aksug deposit formed at the end of the early Cambrian. Ore occurrences similar in magmatism and mineralization to the Aksug ore deposit are widespread in Tuva and in the Lake Zone in Mongolia. Therefore, it is necessary to reassess the role of the Cambrian and Devonian magmatism in the development of porphyry Cu-Mo mineralization both in Tuva and in the Altai-Sayan orogenic area.

J	Szerencsés, K				Szerencses, Karoly			Belle epoque? The seventies of the 20th century in Hungary	PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC												The paper presents the years of the 1970s of the era hallmarked by the name of Jenos Keder. It is based on new researches, however, it incorporates previous knowledge as well. The decade of the seventies is quite controversial in Hungary. On the one hand, Hungary has passed through the bloody retributions of the Revolution of 1956, on the other hand, dictatorship was functioning effectively, making sure that there is no such thing as a soft or hard dictatorship, there is only dictatorship. However, Hungarians enjoy the Hungarian atmosphere of the sixties, the so called "goulash communism" There is full employment - even if work does not always come with it, there is general, free medical care, etc. One can travel to the West, but with large backpacks and tinned food. Moreover, one can obtain a car after years of waiting, but true enough, only from the offer of the "friendly socialist countries". Construction of block of flats continues as well, exceeding one million. Small summer cottages are being built by the privileged or the more daring along the beeches of the largest lake of Hungary and Central Europe, Lake Balaton. Mass tourism emerges. But it is the seventies when the new wave of the global economic crisis comes. It comes to light that the Hungarian economy can only remain functional through more and more loans. Indebtedness, becoming tragic by this time starts in this period. The paper thoroughly examines, investigates the operation of the Keder regime, mainly based on material from the archives with a demand for academic character. Thus the reader learns what it meant to live, work and make one's way in the seventies in Hungary. It also becomes clear that the decade of the seventies is only the "golden age" of the socialist period by appearance. In fact, it is this decade when those problems occur, which lead to the downfall of the regime in the next one. These were essentially problems of an economic nature, then social, political, demographical etc. ones emerged in association with them. However, the obstinate desire of Hungarians for national independence and a democratic political system should not be underestimated. For those who are interested, the author's monograph titled "The Cursed Decade", which discusses in detail the years of the seventies of the Kadar era, could be an important reading.																			1427-7476						2012	2	20					29	52																WOS:000421922200003

COSL is constructing a deepwater drilling rig recently, and it will be completed in 4-5 years. COSL needs to find out a way to modify semi submersibles to explore oilfield in water of 1,500 m during these years. COSL noticed the Artificial Buoyancy Seabed (ABS) unit, which may be matched to semi-submersible platform to perform drilling operation in deepwater up to 1500 m. The main principle of concept is to set a tank of buoyancy (the ABS unit) under 300m below sea surface, which is as a base of the semi-submersible rig. The ABS unit could utilize its buoyancy force to support the weight of BOP and other facilities such as risers, and the BOP will be set in a short distance from the sea surface. Since June 2004, COSL has carried out a series of tests to prove the feasibility of the new concept to deepwater drilling, and acquired a lot of data on the limited conditions for ABS unit. These data are, for example, the maximum loading forces, the maximum currents to resistance and the window of time to operation and so on. The tests were taken from both the pool of the lab and the lake in the main land of China, except for a model test in a pool. COSL had researched the test results for ABS unit, including a test of ABS unit in the sea near a city of Norway in 2002, and thought ABS unit is an accepted concept to do in the deepwater drilling. The paper describes not only the base structure, the procedure of testing about the feasibility by COSL, and showed some preliminary conclusions about this new concept. The summary of the paper strongly supports the application of the ABS unit, and points out that COSL will drill the first trial well in South China Sea at the summer of 2007 to prove the feasibility. If the trial well has been succeeded the ABS unit will be used in the explored well in the end of 2007 or primary of 2008.																			1098-6189		978-1-880653-68-5				2007							161	+																WOS:000250717700022
J	Kallenbach, E				Kallenbach, Elizabeth			Fiber Artifacts from the Paisley Caves: 14,000 Years of Plant Selection in the Northern Great Basin	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												Paleoethnobotanical remains from basketry and cordage from the Paisley Caves offer an opportunity to explore how people engaged with plant communities over time. Fiber identification of textiles, together with radiocarbon dating, contributes new information about landscape use within the Summer Lake Basin. Expanded marshlands during the terminal Pleistocene / Early Holocene created suitable plant communities ideal for fiber technology, specifically wetland monocots and herbaceous dicots-including dogbane and stinging nettle-by 11,000 years ago. This technology is key to subsistence activities and craft production throughout the Holocene. Despite climatic events during the Middle Holocene, in which people transitioned from caves to sites centered on lakeshores and wetlands, the suite of fiber plants and their technological application remains constant. During the Late Holocene, bast fiber material diversified with the addition of flax and milkweed. The presence of flax in particular, a high-elevation plant, may reflect the increased use of upland root collection areas as populations increased. This research provides long-term data on culturally significant native plants used in the manufacture of fiber-based textiles over the last 14,000 years. Restos paleoetnobotanicas de cesteria y cordaje de las Cuevas Paisley ofrecen una oportunidad a explorar como la gente interactuaron con comunidades vegetales con el tiempo. Identificacion de fibras textiles, junto con datacion por radiocarbono, contribuye nueva informacion sobre el uso del paisaje dentro de la Cuenca del Lago de Verano. Pantanos expandidos durante el Tarde Pleistoceno / Temprano Holoceno crearon comunidades vegetales adecuadas ideales para tecnologia de fibra, especificamente monocotiledoneas de humedales y dicotiledoneas herbaceas incluyendo dogbane y ortiga hace 12.000 cal aP Esta tecnologia es clave para las actividades de subsistencia y la produccion artesanal durante todo el Holoceno. A pesar de los acontecimientos climaticos durante el Holoceno Medio, en los que la gente hizo la transicion de cuevas a sitios centrados alrededor de lagos y humedales, el conjunto de plantas de fibra y su aplicacion tecnologica se mantienen constantes. Durante el Holoceno Tardio, el material de fibra de liber se diversifico con la adicion de lino y algodoncillo. La presencia de lino en particular, una planta de gran altitud, puede reflejar el aumento del uso de las zonas de recoleccion de raices de las tierras altas a medida que aumentaban las poblaciones. Esta investigacion proporciona datos a largo plazo sobre plantas nativas culturalmente significativas utilizadas en la fabricacion de textiles a base de fibra durante los ultimos 14.000 anos.

It is a diverse and commercially important fruit plant due to its versatile use in industries as well as in table and raisins, it is grown worldwide from subtropical to temperate zones. Unfortunately, despite its potential and demand in Pakistan, grapes are still considered a minor fruit crop. Potohar is the most neglected area in terms of grape production in Pakistan. The progressive farmers in this region have imported genotypes from different parts of the world, but these cultivars are yet to be characterized and registered. For this purpose, this study contained 17 grape cultivars, which were characterized based on ampelography and biochemical traits for determining correlation and variation among them. For Ampelographic characterization of grapes, 41 traits were selected from the UPOV descriptor. The cultivars included Baco Noir, Black magic, Dubovsky Pink, early white, Glory to Ukraine, Gold Finger, Himrod, Jupiter, King ruby, Kishmish Velez, Lakemont, Long-awaited, NARC black, Sugra one, Sultana C, Summer royal, and Vitro black. For observing variation, principal component analysis was used and the variation among grape cultivars was illustrated in Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The results revealed great variation in Ampelographic traits among cultivars. In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram revealed that variation between the clusters was 78.88% while the variation within the clusters was 28.12% and cultivars were grouped into two clusters. Mature leaf, young leaf, and berry were the most responsible factors for this variation among grape cultivars. The phenological calendar revealed Early white and Surgraone as the earliest maturing cultivars. Biochemical parameters were also helpful in depicting the relationship among grape cultivars having non-reducing sugar and ascorbic acid as the most significant tool for variation among grape cultivars. Dendrogram developed based on biochemical traits. According to the dendrogram, the variation between the clusters was 58.92%, while the variation within the cluster was 41.8%, and cultivars were grouped into three clusters. The results will be helpful in the registration of grape cultivars present in the Potohar region.

J	Coveney, MF; Stites, DL; Lowe, EF; Battoe, LE; Conrow, R				Coveney, MF; Stites, DL; Lowe, EF; Battoe, LE; Conrow, R			Nutrient removal from eutrophic lake water by wetland filtration	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lake Apopka is a large (125 km(2)). shallow (mean depth 1.6 m) lake in Florida. USA. The lake was made hypereutrophic by phosphorus loading from floodplain farms and has high levels of nutrients, phytoplankton (Ch1 a 80 mug l(-1)), and suspended matter. The restoration plan developed by the St. Johns River Water Management District encompasses the biomanipulation concept in which the critical step for large shallow lakes is increasing the transparency of the water to allow the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes. Restoration includes operation of a treatment wetland, reduction in external P loading, harvest of fish, fluctuation of lake levels. and littoral planting. The District constructed a 2-km(2) pilot-scale treatment wetland to test nutrient-removal and hydraulic performance, Lake water was recirculated for 29 months. and the removal of suspended solids and particle-bound nutrients was assessed. Hydraulic loading rate varied from 6.5 to 65 m year(-1) with a mean hydraulic residence time of about 7 days. The inflow contained 40-180 mg l(-1) TSS, 80-380 mug l(-1) TP (mostly particulate organic). and 3-9 mg l(-1) TN (mostly dissolved and particulate organic). Overall, particulate matter was removed (> 90% by the wetland, and soluble organic compounds were unaffected. Soluble inorganic compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) were low in the lake water but increased during passage through the wetland. Particulate matter at the outlet was enriched in both N (2-fold) and P (5-fold) compared to particles in the inflow. Mass removal efficiencies were 89-99 (TSS), 30-67 (TP), and 30-52% (TN), but efficiency fell when hydraulic short-circuiting occurred. First-order removal coefficients were 107 (TSS), 63 m year(-1) (TP) and 98 m year(-1) (particulate N). Areal particulate removal rates were 5.4 g dry matter m(-2) day(-1), 0.18 g PON m(-2) day(-1), and 0.006 g POP m(-2) day(-1). The ratio of N:P removal was 28:1. Total sedimentation rate was 0.4 mm day(-1) of very light matter 4.4 g dw l(-1)). About 40% of the dry matter and nitrogen removed and about 80% of the phosphorus was found in the new sediments. Relative to the inflow of lake water, evapotranspiration (4.3%), seepage (2.6%). and rainfall (2.8%) were low. Major problems were initial leaching of SRP. but not ammonia, from native organic soils and vegetation when this former farmland was flooded hydraulic short-circuiting via former drainage ditches: and low inflows under drought conditions. After 6 months SRP release declined, and initial SRP leaching could be prevented with soil treatment. Hydraulic short-circuiting occurred only after modifications were made. Low gravity flows were augmented with pumped inflows. With these improvements P-removal should increase from the measured 0.48 to at least 3 g P m(-2) year(-1). Based on the pilot project results, the first phase of an improved 14-km(2) wetland filter has been constructed. This project should accelerate improvements in the water quality of Lake Apopka Mid. ultimately. create a new, large wildlife-rich marsh. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Clonality, local population structure and gametophyte sex ratios in cryptic species of the Sphagnum magellanicum complex	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Sphagnum (peatmoss) comprises a moss (Bryophyta) clade with similar to 300500 species. The genus has unparalleled ecological importance because Sphagnum-dominated peatlands store almost a third of the terrestrial carbon pool and peatmosses engineer the formation and microtopography of peatlands. Genomic resources for Sphagnum are being actively expanded, but many aspects of their biology are still poorly known. Among these are the degree to which Sphagnum species reproduce asexually, and the relative frequencies of male and female gametophytes in these haploid-dominant plants. We assess clonality and gametophyte sex ratios and test hypotheses about the local-scale distribution of clones and sexes in four North American species of the S. magellanicum complex. These four species are difficult to distinguish morphologically and are very closely related. We also assess microbial communities associated with Sphagnum host plant clones and sexes at two sites. Methods Four hundred and five samples of the four species, representing 57 populations, were subjected to restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Analyses of population structure and clonality based on the molecular data utilized both phylogenetic and phenetic approaches. Multi-locus genotypes (genets) were identified using the RADseq data. Sexes of sampled ramets were determined using a molecular approach that utilized coverage of loci on the sex chromosomes after the method was validated using a sample of plants that expressed sex phenotypically. Sex ratios were estimated for each species, and populations within species. Difference in fitness between genets was estimated as the numbers of ramets each genet comprised. Degrees of clonality [numbers of genets/numbers of ramets (samples)] within species, among sites, and between gametophyte sexes were estimated. Sex ratios were estimated for each species, and populations within species. Sphagnum-associated microbial communities were assessed at two sites in relation to Sphagnum clonality and sex. Key Results All four species appear to engage in a mixture of sexual and asexual (clonal) reproduction. A single ramet represents most genets but two to eight ramets were dsumbers ansd text etected for some genets. Only one genet is represented by ramets in multiple populations; all other genets are restricted to a single population. Within populations ramets of individual genets are spatially clustered, suggesting limited dispersal even within peatlands. Sex ratios are male-biased in S. diabolicum but female-biased in the other three species, although significantly so only in S. divinum. Neither species nor males/females differ in levels of clonal propagation. At St Regis Lake (NY) and Franklin Bog (VT), microbial community composition is strongly differentiated between the sites, but differences between species, genets and sexes were not detected. Within S. divinum, however, female gametophytes harboured two to three times the number of microbial taxa as males. Conclusions These four Sphagnum species all exhibit similar reproductive patterns that result from a mixture of sexual and asexual reproduction. The spatial patterns of clonally replicated ramets of genets suggest that these species fall between the so-called phalanx patterns, where genets abut one another but do not extensively mix because of limited ramet fragmentation, and the guerrilla patterns, where extensive genet fragmentation and dispersal result in greater mixing of different genets. Although sex ratios in bryophytes are most often female-biased, both male and female biases occur in this complex of closely related species. The association of far greater microbial diversity for female gametophytes in S. divinum, which has a female-biased sex ratio, suggests additional research to determine if levels of microbial diversity are consistently correlated with differing patterns of sex ratio biases.

However, studies investigating the relationship between paleoclimate and ecosystem changes during MIS3 remain limited, thereby constraining our understanding of the response of vegetation to climatic fluctuations on the glacial-interglacial timescale. Moreover, in comparison to local-scale topographic pollen sources, traditional lake sedimentary environments introduce a higher degree of uncertainty into vertical vegetation reconstructions. Here, we present a pollen record derived from a peat core of the Niangniang (NN) Mountain Wetland, aiming to reconstruct biome and climate variations over the past 37 ka. Our findings indicate that during the LGP, the study area was predominantly covered by deciduous broadleaved forests (DBLF), with Quercus (D) and other Betulaceae taxa as the main components. Although a sedimentary hiatus occurred in the core sediments between 18.5 and 4.6 ka, it is still possible to infer that from the LGP to the late Holocene, the forests surrounding the NN wetland transitioned from DBLF to evergreen broadleaved forests (EBLF), which were predominantly composed of Castanopsis and Cyclobalanopsis. Over the past 2400 years, the rapid expansion of associated plants, including Poaceae and Pinus, along with secondary taxa such as Alnus, has driven a gradual transition to the Alpine Shrubland and Meadow (ALSM) biome. This shift is largely attributed to early human activities and fires. By comparing these results with other pollen and climate records, we conclude that DBLF expanded extensively at medium-to-high altitudes during the LGP, rather than evergreen sclerophyllous Quercus forest (ESQF). Consequently, previous estimates of mean annual temperature (MAT) based on pollen data may have been inflated from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the Holocene. In addition to the drivers operating at the glacial-interglacial scale, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a pivotal role in modulating the variability of the Indian Monsoon precipitation, which in turn influences biome succession in SW China.					汤, 永杰/JJD-9646-2023; huang, kangyou/JPL-4936-2023														0277-3791	1873-457X				DEC 1	2025	369								109636	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109636		DEC 2025											WOS:001587212600001
J	Evans, MS; Muir, D; Lockhart, WL; Stern, G; Ryan, M; Roach, P				Evans, MS; Muir, D; Lockhart, WL; Stern, G; Ryan, M; Roach, P			Persistent organic pollutants and metals in the freshwater biota of the Canadian Subarctic and Arctic: An overview	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Over 1999-2002, an extensive series of contaminant studies was conducted on freshwater biota of Canada's Arctic and Subarctic regions. The majority of inorganic contaminant studies focused on mercury and fish. While mercury concentrations were low in benthic feeding fish such as whitefish, predatory fish such as lake trout, pike, and walleye frequently had mercury levels which exceeded 0.2 mu g/g, the consumption guideline for frequent consumers of fish, and 0.5 mu g/g, the guideline for the commercial use of fish. Numerous consumption advisories were issued for lakes along the Mackenzie River. Relatively high mercury levels appear to be due to a combination of relatively old fish populations (because of light fishing pressures) and tend to be more prevalent in smaller lakes where warmer summer water temperatures and watershed influences result in greater mercury and methyl mercury inputs. Mercury levels were substantially lower in char than in lake trout, possibly due to a combination of a less fish-rich diet, a colder environment, and smaller MeHg watershed inputs. Less research has been conducted on other metals but some, such as rubidium, show pronounced variations in concentration that may be related to geological influences. Temporal trend monitoring has revealed little evidence of declining mercury levels in fish that can be attributed to declining atmospheric inputs. Because mercury follows complex pathways in the environment, other factors may operate to counteract reductions in atmospheric mercury sources, e.g., climatic variability, changes in the commercial fishery, and interactions between fish species. Most organochlorine (OC) investigations were based on long term trend monitoring and focused on char (Cornwallis Island), burbot (Great Slave Lake, Yukon lakes, Slave River at Fort Smith, Mackenzie River at Fort Good Hope) and lake trout (Yukon lakes, Great Slave Lake). There was strong evidence of declining OC concentrations in char, particularly Sigma HCH and Sigma chlordane, which may reflect a response to declining atmospheric inputs. Endosulfan concentrations increased, as in the atmosphere. There also was evidence of declining OC concentrations in burbot in the Slave and Mackenzie rivers but not in Great Slave Lake and Yukon lakes. OC concentrations decreased in lake trout in Yukon lakes in the 2000s, most probably because of changes in the fish themselves (i.e., reduced lipid content, condition factor) and possibly climatic variability. Similarly, OCs declined in Great Slave Lake trout. New research on PDBEs and perfluorinated compounds determined that these contaminants are widespread in freshwater fish and concentrations may be increasing. Global warming is a major issue of concern for Arctic and Subarctic waters and may have adverse impacts on contaminant levels in fish and other biota. There is a need for contaminant studies in the north to be broadened to investigate climatic effects. In addition, monitoring studies should be broadened to consider factors affecting other aspects of fish biology. Foremost among these is integrating contaminant monitoring studies on lakes such as Lake Laberge and Great Slave Lake with stock assessment studies. Ecosystem based studies should be conducted on Great Slave Lake and Lake Laberge to more effectively understand contaminant trends and should consider inputs (atmospheric, river inflow, resupension), losses (sedimentation, volatilization), and biological pathways.

At Noranda, whole-rock Pb isotope data for the Flavrian, Northwest, Rusty Ridge, and Amulet Formations and the subvolcanic Flavrian intrusion scatter about a line that corresponds to a Pb-Pb age of 2638 +/- 14 Ma. Pb-Pb ages calculated for the individual units are all within error of this age but are significantly younger than the 2700 +/- 2 Ma U-Pb zircon age for the Flavrian intrusion. The Pb-Pb array passes above a tightly constrained field for the galena Pb from ore deposits within the Mine sequence. The younger Pb-Pb ages and the lack of collinearity with the sulfide ores reflect rehomogenization of the Pb isotope compositions in these rocks approximately 60 m.y. after their formation. At Matagami, whole-rock Pb isotope data fall along two arrays. The first, which includes the porphyritic metarhyolite of the Watson Lake Group from the footwall and the key tuffite, corresponds to a Pb-Pb age of 2584(+19/-20) Ma. The second array includes the Bell River igneous complex and the overlying Wabassee Group basalts and corresponds to an age of 2647 +/- 14 Ma. These Pb-Pb ages are approximately 75 and 140 m.y. younger than corresponding zircon U-Pb ages of 2725 +/- 2 and 2725(+3/-2) Ma. Both arrays pass above a tightly constrained field for galena Pb from several Matagami ore deposits and are probably the result of differences in the initial Pb isotope compositions of the respective rocks. The apparent initial Pb values most likely represent heterogeneities in the mantle source regions for these rocks. The younger Pb-Pb ages for the two arrays indicate Pb isotope homogenization in these rocks approximately 100 m.y. after their formation. The cause of the different ages for the two arrays remains controversial but may be the result of either incomplete isotopic homogenization of Pb or an earlier closure of the U-Pb systems in the rocks constituting the older array. The Pb homogenization implied by the young Pb-Pb ages may be the result of the pervasive circulation of hydrothermal solutions that may have been derived from the dewatering of the lower parts of a newly formed, thickened Archean crust. Such large-scale processes apparently occurred 50 to 150 m.y. after this crust was formed and assembled.

J	Albrecht, C; Wilke, T				Albrecht, Christian; Wilke, Thomas			Ancient Lake Ohrid: biodiversity and evolution	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes	SEP 04-08, 2006	Freie Univ Berlin, Berlin, GERMANY		Freie Univ Berlin			Worldwide ancient lakes have been a major focal point of geological, biological, and ecological research, and key concepts in, for example, evolutionary biology are partly based on ancient lake studies. Ancient lakes can be found on most continents and climate zones with most actual or putative ancient lakes in Europe being restricted to the Balkan Region. The arguably most outstanding of them is the oligotrophic and karstic Lake Ohrid, a steep-sided graben of rift formation origin situated in the central Balkans. Here, an attempt is made to summarize current knowledge of the geological, limnological, and faunal history of Lake Ohrid. Additionally, existing data on biodiversity and endemism in Lake Ohrid are updated and evaluated, and patterns and processes of speciation are reviewed in the context of the Ohrid watershed, including its sister lake, Lake Prespa. Whereas the geological history of the Ohrid Graben is relatively well studied, there is little knowledge about the limnological and biotic history of the actual lake (e.g., the age of the extant lake or from where the lake first received its water, along with its first biota). Most workers agree on a time frame of origin for Lake Ohrid of 2-5 million years ago (Mya). However, until now, the exact limnological origin and the origin of faunal or floral elements of Lake Ohrid remain uncertain. Two largely contrasting opinions either favour the theory of de novo formation of Lake Ohrid in a dry polje with a spring or river hydrography or a palaeogeographical connection of Lake Ohrid to brackish waters on the Balkan Peninsula. Whereas neither theory can be rejected at this point, the data summarized in the current review support the de novo hypothesis. An assessment of the fauna and flora of Lake Ohrid confirms that the lake harbours an incredible endemic biodiversity. Despite the fact that some biotic groups are poorly studied or not studied at all, approximately 1,200 native species are known from the lake, including 586 animals, and at least 212 species are endemic, including 182 animals. The adjusted rate of endemicity is estimated at 36% for all taxa and 34% for Animalia. In terms of endemic biodiversity, Lake Ohrid is with these 212 known endemic species and a surface area of 358 km(2) probably the most diverse lake in the world, taking surface area into account. Preliminary phylogeographical analyses of endemic Lake Ohrid taxa indicate that the vast majority of respective sister taxa occurs in the Balkans and that therefore the most recent common ancestors of Ohrid- and non-Ohrid species likely resided in the region when Lake Ohrid came into existence. These data also indicate that there is relatively little faunal exchange and overlap between Lake Ohrid and its sister lake, Lake Prespa, despite the fact that the latter lake is a major water supplier for Lake Ohrid. Studies on selected species flocks and scatters, mostly in molluscs, point towards the assumption that only few lineages originally colonized Lake Ohrid from the Balkans and that the majority of endemic species seen today probably started to evolve within the lake during the early Pleistocene. Within the Ohrid watershed, endemism occurs at different spatial and taxonomic scales, ranging from species endemic to certain parts of Lake Ohrid to species endemic to the whole watershed and from subspecies to genus level and possibly beyond. Modes of speciation in the Ohrid watershed are largely affected by its degree of isolation. Observational evidence points towards both allopatric (peripatric) and parapatric peciation. Though sympatric speciation within a habitat is conceivable, so far there are no known examples. Today, the lake suffers from increasing anthropogenic pressure and a "creeping biodiversity crisis". Some endemic species presumably have already gone extinct, and there are also indications of invasive species penetrating Lake Ohrid. The comparatively small size of Lake Ohrid and the extremely small range of many endemic species, together with increasing human pressure make its fauna particularly vulnerable. It is thus hoped that this review will encourage future research on the ecology and evolutionary biology of the lake's taxa, the knowledge of which would ultimately help protecting this unique European biodiversity hot spot.

J	Turner, BR; Tester, GN				Turner, Brian R.; Tester, Gillian N.			The Table Rocks Sandstone: A fluvial, friction-dominated lobate mouth bar sandbody in the Westphalian B Coal Measures, NE England	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Westphalian B (Duckmantian) alluvial Coal Measures along the Northumberland coast, NE England, comprise coal-capped coarsening-upward crevasse-splay sequences of shale, siltstone and sandstone, interbedded with a number of major distributary channel sandbodies, including the Table Rocks Sandstone. Lithofacies, architectural analysis and outcrop geometries divide the Table Rocks Sandstone into flaggy sandstone, massive sandstone, heterolithic, and mudstone facies associations, each comprising up to 7 lithofacies types. The three sandy facies associations are characterised by lenticular bed geometries on different scales producing a hierarchy of lensoid packages and associated bounding surfaces, all showing typical offset stacking patterns: (1) lenses, represent individual lenticular cross-bed sets, bounded by 1st order surfaces; (2) packages of lenses, called lens clusters are bounded by 2nd order surfaces, and are the basic architectural building block of the sandy facies associations; and (3) vertically stacked lens clusters called amalgamated lens clusters, bounded by 3rd order surfaces. The Table Rocks sandbody has a laterally extensive, irregular, lobate subsurface plan geometry, it displays a radial palacocurrent pattern with 180 degrees dispersion, and it forms part of a 14-m thick coarsening-upward regressive sequence. It is interpreted as a composite, lobate crevasse-splay delta system that prograded into a shallow interdistributary fresh to brackish water lake up to 14 in deep. The shallow lake water, fluvial input, and extensive development of traction structures such as cross-bedding and ripple cross-lamination suggests a friction-dominated delta, in which the four facies associations can be interpreted in terms of discrete elements of the mouth bar environment. ne flaggy sandstone fircies association represents the main, axial part of the mouth bar system, the erosively based massive sandstone facies association major subaqeous distributary channels, the lithologically more variable heterolithic facies association the medial mouth bar, and the mudstone facies association the distal mouth bar fringe and prodelta. Within this environmental setting amalgamated lens clusters are interpreted as small, discrete mouth bar sand lobes, whose offset, imbricate stacking pattern reflects channel spacing and bifurcation, the rate of channel shifting, or shallow depths and lack of accommodation space. Thus, lens clusters are interpreted as discrete growth elements of the mouth bar sand lobes, and lenses as individual bedforms making up these growth elements. Because of the high rate of channel shifting, lack of extensive erosion of the mouth bar lobes, and deposition of low discharge fines, the lobes retained much of their original depositional geometry, thereby providing advantageous gradients for offset deposition and stacking of adjacent sand lobes. Although the delta complex was maintained by frequent crevassing from the feeder channel, and by subsidence due to contemporaneous compaction and/or local tectonism, it was deeply incised on two occasions by subaqeous channels in response to high magnitude floods or falling lake level.

J	Galley, AG				Galley, AG			Composite synvolcanic intrusions associated with Precambrian VMS-related hydrothermal systems	MINERALIUM DEPOSITA												Large subvolcanic intrusions are recognized within most Precambrian VMS camps. Of these, 80% are quartz diorite-tonalite-trondhjemite composite intrusions. The VMS camps spatially associated with composite intrusions account for >90% of the aggregate sulfide tonnage of all the Precambrian, intrusion-related VMS camps. These low-alumina, low-K, and high-Na composite intrusions contain early phases of quartz diorite and tonalite, followed by more voluminous trondhjemite. They have a high proportion of high silica (>74% SiO2) trondhjemite which is compositionally similar to the VMS-hosting rhyolites within the volcanic host-rock successions. The quartz-diorite and possibly tonalite phases follow tholeiitic fractionation trends whereas the trondhjemites fall within the composition field for primitive crustal melts. These transitional M-I-type primitive intrusive suites are associated with extensional regimes within oceanic-arc environments. Subvolcanic composite intrusions related to the Archean Sturgeon Lake and Noranda, and Paleoproterozoic Snow Lake VMS camps range in volume from 300 to 1,000 km(3). Three have a sill morphology with strike lengths between 15 and 22 km and an average thickness between 1,500 and 2,000 m. The fourth has a gross stock-like shape. The VMS deposits are principally restricted to the volcanic strata above the strike length of the intrusions, as are areally extensive, thin exhalite units. The composite intrusions contain numerous internal phases which are commonly clustered within certain parts of the composite intrusion. These clusters underlie eruptive centers surrounded by areas of hydrothermal alteration and which contain most of the VMS deposits. Early quartz-diorite and tonalite phases appear to have intruded in rapid succession. Evidence includes gradational contacts, magma mixing and disequilibrium textures. They appear to have been emplaced as sill-dike swarms. These early phases are present as pendants and xenoliths within later trondhjemite phases. The trondhjemite phases contain numerous internal contacts indicating emplacement as composite sills. Common structural features of the composite intrusions include early xenolith phases, abundant small comagmatic dikes, fractures and veins and, in places, columnar jointing. Internal phases may differ greatly in texture from fine- to coarse-grained, aphyric and granophyric through seriate to porphyritic. Mineralogical and isotopic evidence indicates that early phases of each composite intrusion are affected by pervasive to fracture-controlled high-temperature (350-450 degreesC) alteration reflecting seawater-rock interaction. Trondhjemite phases contain hydrothermal-magmatic alteration assemblages within miarolitic cavities, hydrothermal breccias and veins. This hydrothermal-magmatic alteration may, in part, be inherited from previously altered wall rocks. Two of the four intrusions are host to Cu-Mo-rich intrusive breccias and porphyry-type mineralization which formed as much as 14 Ma after the main subvolcanic magmatic activity. The recognition of these Precambrian, subvolcanic composite intrusions is important for greenfields VMS exploration, as they define the location of thermal corridors within extensional oceanic-arc regimes which have the greatest potential for significant VMS mineralization. The VMS mineralization may occur for 2,000 m above the intrusions. In some cases, VMS mineralization has been truncated or enveloped by late trondhjemite phases of the composite intrusions. Evidence that much of the trondhjemitic magmatism postdates the principal VMS activity is a critical factor when developing heat and fluid flow models for these subseafloor magmatic-hydrothermal systems.																			0026-4598	1432-1866				JUN	2003	38	4					443	473		10.1007/s00126-002-0300-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00126-002-0300-9													WOS:000184027400003
J	Plint, AG; Wadsworth, JA				Plint, AG; Wadsworth, JA			Sedimentology and palaeogeomorphology of four large valley systems incising delta plains, western Canada Foreland Basin: implications for mid-Cretaceous sea-level changes	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The mid-Cenomanian Dunvegan Formation represents a delta complex deposited on a foreland basin ramp over about 2 my. The Dunvegan is divided into 10 transgressive-regressive allomembers, labelled J-A in ascending order, each defined by regional marine transgressive surfaces. Parasequences within allomembers show an aggradational to offlapping stacking pattern that reflects alternate generation and removal of accommodation. The upper surfaces of allomembers H-E are incised by extensive valley systems traceable for up to 320 km and over about 50 000 km(2). Valley depths range up to 41 m and can change significantly over short distances. However, the average depth of incision (mean 21 m) shows no systematic variation in longitudinal profiles and no evidence of headward shallowing. Valleys are typically 1-2 km wide, but locally widen to about 8 km. Widening is sometimes associated with confluence zones, but elsewhere it is not. Updip reaches of valleys are dominated by cross-bedded fluvial sandstone forming multistorey point-bar deposits. Sandstones contain widespread but uncommon paired carbonaceous drapes recognizable as tidal bundles. Inclined heterolithic stratification is locally well developed at the top of the valley fill. Downdip reaches of valleys, typically within 50 km of the lowstand shoreline, have a sandstone-dominated lower part and, locally, a mud-rich upper portion consisting of a variety of laminated heterolithic facies with a clear tidal signature. These heterolithic deposits may represent central basin, tidal flat, bayhead delta and point-bar environments. Valley filling took place mainly during the transgressive systems tract (TST) when tidally influenced environments migrated upvalley. Semi-diurnal tidal backwater effects extended at least 30 km landward of the regional maximum transgressive marine shoreline. The aggradational late TST and highstand systems tract (HST) includes deltaic and coastal plain deposits comprising lake and anastomosed river deposits that suggest a very low gradient (approximate to 1:3000). Delta parasequences of the falling stage systems tract (FSST) offlap seaward and have no equivalent coastal plain deposits. The FSST has an average width of 60 km and an inferred gradient of 1:2500. The upper surfaces of the HST and FSST are extensively incised by valleys. The lowstand systems tract (LST) is subtly aggradational, lacks valleys and is characterized by large delta lobes fed by major distributaries. The width and inferred slope of the FSST, coupled with the thickness of aggradational TST and HST deposits on the coastal plain, suggest a vertical accommodation of about 35 m per transgressive event. About 11 m of this is attributed to isostatic subsidence resulting from water and sediment loads; the residual 24 m is attributed to eustatic rise. This sea-level change is of the same order of magnitude as the valley depths. The length of valleys, however, does not seem to be explicable solely in terms of downstream forcing by sea-level change, and an additional, upstream-forcing mechanism, possibly related to precipitation cycles in the Milankovitch band, might be inferred.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				DEC	2003	50	6					1147	1186		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2003.00599.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2003.00599.x													WOS:000186913500008
J	Brooks, GR; Medioli, BE				Brooks, Gregory R.; Medioli, Barbara E.			Sub-bottom profiling and coring of sub-basins along the lower French River, Ontario: insights into depositional environments within the North Bay outlet	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sub-bottom profiling was conducted at eight sub-basins within the lower French River area, Ontario, to investigate deposits preserved within the ancient North Bay outlet. Ten cores were collected that targeted the four depositional acoustic facies identified in the sub-bottom profiling records. The rhythmically laminated/bedded glaciolacustrine deposits of facies I are interpreted to have aggraded within glacial Lake Algonquin and its associated recessional lakes that persisted between 13,000 and 11,300 cal BP (similar to 11,100 and 9,900 BP). The majority of the facies II, III and IV lacustrine deposits accumulated between about 9,500 cal BP (similar to 8,500 BP) and the mid-Holocene, based on radiocarbon-dated organic materials. These deposits represent sedimentation within a 'large' lake during the late portion of the Mattawa-Stanley phase, and the Nipissing transgression, Nipissing Great Lakes and post-Nipissing recession phases of lake levels. Two sets of organic-rich sand beds are preserved within facies II deposits and reveal that the large lake lacustrine depositional environment was interrupted during the late Mattawa-Stanley phase between 9,500-9,300 and 9,000-8,400 cal BP (similar to 8,500-8,300 and similar to 8,000-7,600 BP), when the water surface of Lake Hough fell below the outlet threshold and the lake basin became hydrologically closed. Pre-9,500 cal BP (similar to 8,500 BP), the early and middle portions of the Mattawa-Stanley phase were dominated by erosion, as reflected by an unconformity at the base of facies II that occurs widely in the sub-basins and the general lack of preserved deposits for these intervals in the cores. This erosion is attributed to wave action and fluvial scouring within the outlet mouth during the early and mid-Stanley-Hough low stages and relates specifically to the period when the flowing portion of the North Bay outlet was situated over the lower French River area. This study reveals that the majority of the post-glacial deposits accumulated after the outlet threshold had shifted permanently eastwards and the lower French River area was inundated under the multiple phases of the large lake occupying the Nipissing Lowlands and Georgian-Huron basins, extending well into the mid-Holocene. The occurrence of deposits marking two closed-basin intervals during the late Stanley-Hough stage are well preserved locally within the lacustrine depositional sequence, but identifying earlier closed-basin intervals from the French River stratigraphy is hindered by the lack of preserved pre-9,500 cal BP (similar to 8,500 BP) post-glacial deposits.

Although aragonite shells of Gyraulus sp. are a potentially valuable archive of information on environmental changes, the living environment of Gyraulus sp. and the significance of its shell geochemistry (e.g., Sr/Ca-s, Mg/Ca-s, delta C-13(s,) delta O-18(s)) are unknown or disputed. In this study we investigated living specimens of the dominant species of Gyraulus sp. (Gyraulus convexiusculus) in rivers, wetlands, and lakes on the TP, together with its fossil shells in the Holocene lacustrine sediments of Nam Co (NC) on the TP. Specifically, we measured the values of Sr/Ca-s, Mg/Ca-s, delta C-13(s,) and delta O-18(s) of the modern and fossil shells. Our results indicate that the hydrochemical composition and electrical conductivity of the ambient water significantly affect the survival and abundance of G. convexiusculus. The environmental tolerance of G. convexiusculus can be ordered as: carbonate-type > sulfate-type > chloride-type. Additionally, we speculate that the upper threshold of electrical conductivity for the survival of G. convexiusculus does not exceed similar to 4544 mu S/cm. Furthermore, we established the relationship between modern G. convexiusculus shells and its host water and developed Gyraulus-based transfer functions (TFs). To assess their potential for paleoenvironment reconstruction, the TFs were then applied to fossil shells of G. convexiusculus collected from a Holocene lake sediment profile from a terrace around NC. We show that Sr/Ca-s in G. convexiusculus is a potentially reliable proxy for reconstructing the Sr/Ca of the paleo-water (Sr/CaPaleo-w) and the paleoconductivity. By contrast, Mg/Ca-s in G. convexiusculus cannot be used for environmental reconstruction. delta C-13(s) in G. convexiusculus primarily reflects the delta C-13(DIC) of the host water. When the host water is deficient in HCO3- + CO32- (<280 mg/L) there is an increased supply of dissolved carbon derived from organic sources to the shells of G. convexiusculus. Overall, delta O-18(s) in G. convexiusculus is likely one of the most reliable indicators for the delta O-18(w) of the host water of the lakes on the TP.

J	Waksmundzka, MI				Waksmundzka, Maria I.			Sequence stratigraphy of Carboniferous paralic deposits in the Lublin Basin (SE Poland)	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												Based on lithofacies analysis of clastic, clay and carbonate rocks, wireline logs and sequence stratigraphy, sixteen depositional sequences have been distinguished in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin from the Visean to the base of Westphalian B. The facies evolution and depositional architecture of the deposits belonging to three types of depositional systems tracts, i.e. lowstand (LST), transgressive (TST) and highstand (HST) have been reconstructed. The sequences are bounded by type 1 basal unconformities formed during subaerial erosion following relative sea-level fall and lowstand. This erosion, that in some cases reached down to the LST deposits of the underlying sequences, mainly affected the HST deposits. Relative sea-level rise controlling the base level of the rivers during lowstand was the basic factor influencing facies development, cyclicity and thickness of fluvial deposits, as well as the vertical and lateral transformation of rivers in the paralic Carboniferous succession. Vertical transition of high-to low-energy fluvial environments can be observed within the LST. The LST deposits typically occur in incised shelf valleys and in non-incised fluvial systems. Within the LST of sequences 2 and 4 to 10 commonly occur medium and large systems of simple incised valleys that developed in a coastal-plain system. The LST of sequences 11 to 15 comprises large systems of compound incised valleys that developed in a piedmont system. Relative sea-level rise in the late lowstand, sea-level oscillations during transgression and highstand and the volume of sediment supply were the main factors influencing facies development, cyclicity, thickness and lateral distribution of the deltaic deposits, shallow-shelf shales and limestones. Within the TST commonly occur coarsening-upward and non-gradational cyclothems that correspond to parasequences and were formed in the distal parts of the inner-shelf delta lobes. In the HST, the most common types are coarsening-upward cyclothems developed during the progradation of inner-shelf delta lobes and small lake deltas, as well as non-gradational cyclothems formed in lakes on a delta plain without influence of delta lobes. The transgression of sequence 7 probably had the widest extent of all the sequences in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin. It was presumably much wider to the N, NE and NW than the presently accepted boundaries of the basin. Based on analysis of three curves of relative sea-level changes in the paralic Carboniferous succession of the Lublin Basin and the transgressive-regressive curve for the Carboniferous of Western Europe, the sequences distinguished have been correlated with the chronostratigraphic scheme for the Carboniferous System. The diachronous commencement of sedimentation has been confirmed and evaluated. The lack of deposits of sequence 5 in the eastern part of the basin suggests the presence of a stratigraphic gap encompassing the upper Brigantian. The position and range of stratigraphic gaps present elsewhere in the basin has also been indicated. In the north-westernmost and easternmost parts of the study area the gap has the widest range, encompassing the upper Arnsbergian to lower Marsdenian strata. The mid-Carboniferous boundary between the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian has been located at the base of sequence 8.

Peipsi, L. Pihkva, L. Lammijarv) is located on the border of Estonia and Russia. L. Peipsi belongs to unstratified eutrophic lakes with mesotrophic features, L. Lammijarv has some dyseutrophic features, while L. Pihkva is strongly eutrophic. The total annual nutrient load is 15.57 tons N km(-2) and 327 kgP km(-2) with 74% of N and 39% of P originating from agriculture. The mean concentrations of total N and P in the lake are 876 mg m(-3) and 46 mg m(-3), respectively, both being the highest in L. Pihkva and the lowest in the northern part of L. Peipsi. Average pH is 8.14 and Secchi disk transparency 1.63 m. Diatoms and blue-green algae prevail in phytoplankton biomass. The blue-greens Gloeotrichia echinulata and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae dominate in summer causing the water-blooms. The concentration of Chla was the lowest in the northern part of L. Peipsi (mean 14.7 mg m(-3)) and the highest in the southern part of L. Pihkva (mean 47.9 mg m(-3), median 16.3 mg m(-3)). An increase of Chla and decrease of Secchi depth could be noticed in 1983-1988, while in 1988-1994 the tendency was opposite. The long-term average primary production is 0.8 g C m(-2) d(-1). Zooplankton is remarkably rich in species, the average biomass in the vegetative period being 2-3 g m(-3) and production 22 g C m(-2). The role of rotifers in production is 53% followed by that of cladocerans (30%), copepods (16%) and Dreissena polymorpha larvae (1%). The total count of bacteria is 1-9 million cells per mi. Chironomus plumosus and Potamothrix hammoniensis are dominating in the profundal. The average abundance of macrozoobenthos (without big molluscs) 2617 ind. m(-2), and their biomass 12.34 g m(-2) are considered to be the highest among the large lakes of North Europe. Macroflora occupies a small percentage of the total lake area but is rich in species. Taxa forming communities are Potamogeton perfoliatus, Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Poramogeton lucens, Eleocharis palustris, and Polygonum amphibium. Submerged vegetation occupies the first place amongst different growth forms, followed by emergent plants. The main commercial fishes are lake smelt, perch, ruff, roach, bream, pike, vendace and pikeperch. The stock of vendace has sharply decreased in the last years, while the amount of pikeperch has increased. Considering annual fish catches (9000-12000 tons or 25-34 kg ha(-1)), L. Peipsi-Pihkva exceeds all large lakes in North Europe.

J	Nakashima, D; Nakamura, T; Noguchi, T				Nakashima, D; Nakamura, T; Noguchi, T			Formation history of CI-like phyllosilicate-rich clasts in the Tsukuba meteorite inferred from mineralogy and noble gas signatures	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Fine-grained, angular black clasts with longest dimensions up to 800 mum were found, dispersed in a brecciated region in the Tsukuba meteorite. The clasts, much darker than the dark portions of the light-dark structure in the Tsukuba host, are characterized by the presence of plaquette, spherulitic, and framboidal magnetites and pseudohexagonal pyrrhotite. Synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the major silicate phases in the clasts are saponite and serpentine. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the phyllosilicates have compositions quite similar to those in the Orgueil CI carbonaceous chondrite. Therefore, mineralogically and chemically, the clasts resemble CI chondrites and are quite different from the host H5-6 chondrite Tsukuba. The clasts serve as an indicator of temperatures during regolith lithification of the Tsukuba parent body, because their mineralogy and noble gas compositions are subject to change during weak heating. The 001 basal spacing of saponite in the clast is 13.2 Angstrom, which indicates that saponite retains interlayer water molecules. This observation and the presence of serpentine suggest that the clasts, as a whole, have never been heated above 500degreesC. Noble gas analyses showed that the clasts contain large amounts of solar and primordial noble gases. The results of stepwise heating analyses indicate that no apparent thermal loss of noble gases from the clasts occurred, consistent with the mineralogical evidence. TEM observation revealed that the periphery of a clast was transformed into amorphous phases, indicating that only the periphery was heated to 700degreesC. Based on the results of our analyses, the formation history of the clasts can be evaluated as follows. Constituents of the clasts had been exposed to solar wind on the surface of the CI-chondrite-like parent body and formed the clasts. After ejection from the CI-like parent body, the CI-like meteoroid accreted to the Tsukuba parent body after early thermal metamorphism that reached 700-1000degreesC. The clasts must have been located in the regolith, because they were found among the light-dark structure in the meteorite and contain abundant solar noble gases. Impacts into the regolith have crushed the clasts into smaller pieces and probably induced lithification of the regolith material. During lithification, the peripheries of the clasts were heated briefly to 700degreesC, but the temperature of the interior of the clasts has never exceeded 500degreesC. This is the first evidence constraining temperature during lithification of the ordinary-chondrite parent-body regolith. Finally, the Tsukuba meteoroid, including the CI-like clasts, was ejected from the Tsukuba parent body and fell onto the Earth after a transit time of 8.1 Ma. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Thompson, GG; Withers, PC				Thompson, GG; Withers, PC			Aerial and aquatic respiration of the Australian desert goby, Chlamydogobius eremius	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY					6th International Workshop on Perinatal Development of Birds	OCT 12-16, 2000	FREE UNIV BERLIN, BERLIN, GERMANY		FREE UNIV BERLIN			Physiological, anatomical and behavioural adaptations enable the Australian desert goby, Chlamydogobius eremius, to live in mound springs and temporary aquatic habitats surrounding the south-eastern rim of the Lake Eyre drainage basin in the harsh inland of Australia. This study describes the desert goby's respiratory and metabolic responses to hypoxic conditions and its use of buccal air bubbles for gas exchange at the water surface. Oxygen consumption for C. eremius is significantly higher in water than in air under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In water, total oxygen consumption ((V) over dot (o2)) increases from normoxic conditions (253 mul g(-1) h(-1)) to 8% ambient O-2 concentration (377 mul g(-1) h(-1)), then decreases with increasing hypoxia of 4% O-2 (226 mul g(-1) h(-1)) and at 2% O-2 (123 mul g(-1) h(-1)). In air (fish were moist but Out of water), 1 12 progressively decreases from normoxic conditions to hypoxic conditions (21% O-2, (V) over dot (o2) is 169 mul g(-1) h(-1) to 39 mul g(-1) h(-1) at 2% O-2). These data indicate oxygen-conforming patterns with increasing hypoxia-both in air and in water below 8% O-2. In water, opercular movement rates remain unchanged with increasing hypoxia (139 min(-1) at 21% O-2, 154 min(-1) at 8%, 156 min(-1) at 4% and 167 min(-1) at 2%) but in air, opercular movement rates are significantly lower than in water, corresponding with the lower metabolic rate (71 min(-1) at 21% O-2, 53 min(-1) at 8%, 96 min(-1) at 4% and 64 min(-1) at 2%). Chlamydogobius eremius can use a buccal air bubble for aerial O-2 uptake, most probably in response to increased aquatic hypoxia. In air, C. eremius relies more on the buccal bubble as an oxygen source with increasing hypoxia up to an ambient O-2 of 4% (7.1% of (V) over dot(o2) at 21% O-2; 14.5% at 8% O-2; and 27.1% at 4% O-2), then when the available supply of O-2 is further reduced, it decreases (15% of (V) over dot(o2) at 2% O-2) and respiration across the skin again makes a higher relative contribution. The Australian desert goby has a higher metabolic rate in higher salinities (336 mul g(-1) h(-1) in 35 ppt, 426 mul g(-1) h(-1) in 70 ppt) than in freshwater (235 mul O-2 g(-1) h(-1)), presumably because of the increased metabolic cost of osmoregulation. There was no significant difference in (V) over dot(o2) for fish in air that had come from varying salinities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

B	Larocque-Tobler, I; Laurion, I; Moschen, R; Stewart, M		Dodson, J		Larocque-Tobler, Isabelle; Laurion, Isabelle; Moschen, Robert; Stewart, Monique			Climate and Lacustrine Ecosystems	CHANGING CLIMATES, EARTH SYSTEMS AND SOCIETY	International Year of Planet Earth											Terrestrial aquatic environments cover about 2% of the Earth's surface (Wetzel, 1983, Limnology (767p). Philadelphia, PA: Saunders College Publishing House). However, this small percentage of surface coverage act as important sources of drinking water and sustains biodiversity. The UN estimates that by 2050 there will be an additional 3.5 billion people with most of the population growth in developing countries which already suffer water stress. Climate change could have significant impacts on water resources around the world because of the close connections between the climate and hydrologic cycle. Studying the possible impact of climate on these water resources is thus of primary importance, and on-going research is being made at multiple levels: neo-ecology (studying the actual functioning of these ecosystems), palaeoecology (studying how these ecosystems have functioned in the past) and modelling (predicting their future functioning under climate and anthropogenic influences). Although this chapter is mainly concerned with the past functioning of these ecosystems, a synergy between these three research levels is necessary to better comprehend and estimate the impact of climate change on water resources. An effort is thus made to include some aspects of neo-ecology and modelling of past, present and future terrestrial aquatic environments (Fig. 1). Lakes can act in two ways to help better understand climate change and its effect on terrestrial aquatic ecosystems: (1) they contain multiple indicators which can be used to quantitatively reconstruct climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation, atmospheric circulation). Although the global temperature seems to have increased in the last century, the regional and even local climate can vary, and might be more important for the management of water resources. Only by looking at the climate variation through time at regional and local scales can we better understand and predict the future climate and its impact on water availability and biodiversity. (2) when linked with independent records of climate change, multi-proxy analysis in lakes can provide insight on the possible impacts of climate on water resources. For example, by linking the historical reconstruction of total productivity of various biological assemblages preserved in lake sediments and the meteorological data of the last 200 years, Korhola et al. (2002) have shown that these changes were due to climate warming. This chapter will look at how climate can be reconstructed using proxies preserved in lakes and second how climate has impacted these ecosystems in the past and how it might impact terrestrial aquatic ecosystems in the future.																					978-90-481-8715-7				2010							123	160		10.1007/978-90-481-8716-4_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-8716-4_6	10.1007/978-90-481-8716-4												WOS:000282775600006

The formation is characterized by intercalations of stromatolitic carbonates and provides a perspective of the evolution of photosynthetic organisms, which are interpreted to have been responsible for the oxygenation of earth surface environments in early Earth. Here we investigated the depositional setting of the stromatolitic carbonates for the better understand of the environments, which may have controlled the massive development of oxygenic photosynthesis. We studied lithofacies and sequence-stratigraphic features of the Tumbiana Formation in the Redmont area, a southern margin of the northern Pilbara Craton, on the basis of three-dimensional analyses of onshore outcrops. The Tumbiana Formation, as much as 170 in thick, unconformably overlies the Early to Middle Archean basement rocks and is unconformably overlain by the Maddina Formation that consists of mafic tuffaceous sediments and basalt lavas. The lower part of the Tumbiana Formation is characterized by planar- and trough cross-stratified conglomerates, which are interpreted to be an alluvial-fan deposit shed from the northern hinterlands and developed mainly in local depressions of the basement rocks during late lowstand and early transgressive stages. The base of the middle part is defined by a transgressive surface of erosion overlain by conglomerates and/or breccias that pass upward to mafic tuffaceous mudstones and sandstones intercalated with accretionary lapillis, breccias, and basalt pillow lavas. Mudstones are commonly laminated and sandstones contain current-and wave ripple-lamination, parallel lamination, hummocky cross-stratification, and trough cross-stratification. In general, the middle part exhibits an overall fining- and coarsening-upward pattern and is interpreted to indicate transgressive and regressive shelf-to-coastal lithofacies successions. In particular, the uppermost horizon of the middle part is characterized by sandstone beds with herringbone structures and desiccation cracks, and is interpreted to indicate an intertidal deposit developed during late highstand and/or following falling stages. The middle part of the formation, in general, thickens to the northern proximal area and eventually flattened out the topographic irregularity of the basement rocks. The upper part is characterized by stromatolitic carbonates, associated with minor mudstones and wave- and current-rippled sandstones, and does not exhibit distinct lateral variation in thickness and vertical lithofacies organization. The base of the upper part is characterized by a transgressive lag deposit. The ensuing transgression over the intertidal deposits of the uppermost middle part is interpreted to have developed a new accommodation space for the vertical stacking of stromatolites with different external shapes from elongated small-domal-and columnar-types associated with desiccation cracks to stratiform- and large domal-types. These changes may have responded to the increase in paleowater depth possibly from intertidal to subtidal environments. In conclusion, stromatolites in the upper Tumbiana Formation in the Redmont area are interpreted to have developed in coastal and shallow marine environments in response to the rise in relative sea level rather than in ephemeral saline lakes as proposed by previous studies. However, the outcome of the present research does not necessarily deny the previously proposed interpretation but suggests spatial variations in depositional environments of the Tumbiana Formation from the north to south.

J	Carling, PA				Carling, Paul A.			Freshwater megaflood sedimentation: What can we learn about generic processes?	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is growing recognition that sedimentary deposits related to high-energy, large-scale, freshwater floods are widespread across the continents and, in the main, can be related to Quaternary outbreak flows from ice-dammed lakes. Such deposits may also occur in the Neogene and earlier. Recognition of these 'megaflood' deposits is hindered by the lack of well-conditioned stratigraphic models of depositional successions. However, descriptions of successions from many locations often exhibit commonalities when compared carefully. Thus the primary purpose of this paper is to examine and condense the published stratigraphic and sedimentological evidence so as to identify the key signatures of megaflood successions. The deposits often are the only record of a flood and so the secondary purpose is to interpret the sedimentary sequences in order to recreate the behaviour of floods through single and multiple events. Finally, some pointers are provided as to those areas of sedimentological research that might be profitably explored in more depth to improve understanding of megaflood dynamics. A key characteristic of megaflood deposits is the apparent massive appearance of single units, which on closer inspection usually are amalgamated layers of similar grain-size distribution. Individual beds and sets of beds are commonly near-horizontal, planar and laterally extensive. Successions evidently are not channelized and extensivity is indicative of simultaneous and coherent deposition over large areas. Localised large-scale clinoforms, or smaller-scale cross-beds are common, associated with bar-front or dune progradation respectively, but otherwise extensivity implies that cross-cutting erosional contacts, notably steeply inclined examples, and small-scale scours are not common except immediately around large isolated clasts, such as dropstones and ice-blocks. A common vertical stack of sequences in any one succession consists of: (1) basal, thick, coarse parallel-bedded units, (2) large-scale clinoforms, (3) horizontally-bedded thin laminated units, (4) ripple and dune cross-beds, (5) silt-beds, and (6) succession-capping debris flow deposits (in some cases). Such a succession usually is indicative of a single cycle of waxing and waning flood flow, generally dominated by high-concentration suspension deposition onto plane beds. The high power allows the transport of fine gravel and coarse sand in suspension leading, upon deposition, to relatively coarse beds from suspension fall-out. Clay and silt is generally sparse or absent, being transported further down the system. At the scale of the hydrograph, the successions indicate that flows initially accelerate and then decelerate, with significant shorter period flow pulses also evident in the sedimentary signatures. In parallel-bedded sequences (primarily during waxing flows), bedload transport often was ineffective in sorting sediment due to the high-rates of deposition from the highly sediment-charged waters, resulting in diffuse accretion surfaces. At each location, similar sequence stacks are common, leading to the impression of rhythmic deposition from pulsing flow, including from repetitive series of floods. Although often composed of coarse grains, many sequence stacks (excluding any debris flows) are not dissimilar to turbidity flow sequences; the Bouma sequence in particular. Although there is limited experimental evidence for turbidity currents associated with high energy freshwater flows, theory does not preclude the deposition of similar sedimentary motifs from high concentration flows, such that an analogy between some megaflood sedimentary beds and turbidites is not unreasonable. Despite considerable variation in megaflood sedimentary successions, commonalities occur which are indicative of similar processes of deposition from high energy floods at geographically different locations. The changes in style of deposition throughout a succession provide clues as to the nature of the flood flows and this information could be used to improve estimates of flood hydrograph behaviour. However, hypotheses linking deposit characteristics to flow dynamics are currently ill-conditioned and often poorly tested. The majority of published studies describe the coarser-scale stratigraphy, with only passing reference to the fine-scale structure of individual beds. Closer attention to lamination styles, particle orientation and syn-depositional deformation structures, for example, should provide information on the flow mechanics at the time of bed deposition. Thus, better consideration of the sedimentology of megaflood deposit beds will lead to better understanding of the controlling hydraulics and should result in better models of flood deposition.

J	Deil, U				Deil, U			A review on habitats, plant traits and vegetation of ephemeral wetlands - a global perspective	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												Based upon a world-wide literature review and a database, which refers to 250 publications and documents about 8500 phytosociological releves, the following questions are discussed: What are the common ecological parameters for temporary wetlands and which environmental conditions offer a niche for dwarf ephemerals? Which taxa have evolved and speciated within ephemeral wetland habitats? How do the relations between relief features, local hydrology and climatic conditions change in different parts of the world? Which global patterns In flora and vegetation do occur? The review is restricted to ephemeral freshwater ecosystems with the following two properties: Above-ground plant cover is seasonal, and the habitats are water-saturated or submerged only part of the year. For a better understanding of large-scale patterns, the results of studies about small-scale zonation, variability in time (phenology and year-to-year dynamics), ecophysiology and life strategies are briefly reported. Finally, conservation aspects and trends of floristic globalization are considered. 1. Seasonal pools: They occur in semi-arid and subhumid climates at both sides of the Tropic of Cancer. The catchment areas are local or the ponds are purely rainwater systems. 2. Amphibic shorelines of permanent ponds, lakes and rivers: They concentrate in perhumid extratropical temperate zones and in orotropical climates. Along allochthonous rivers with extended catchments and with seasonal flood pulse, large temporary flood-plains also occur in semi-arid regions. 3. Ephemeral flush habitats: In the perhumid tropics and in the subhumid subtropics, ephemeral wetlands are linked to runoff-habitats like the slopes of inselbergs and rock outcrops and to interflow habitats along intermittent streams. The distribution of some keystone taxa reflects the present climatic differentiation of the globe and to some extent also historical events (palaeogeography, speciation processes). Myosurus for example is linked to extratropical regions, Lilaeopsis to the New World and the Southern Hemisphere, Limnophila and Rhamphicarpa to the Palaeotropical. region. Vicariance patterns are a common phenomenon. Examples can be seen in Isoetes, Marsilea, Ophioglossum, Juncus (sections Tenageia, Ozophyllum and Caespitosi), Limosella, Crassula (section Helophytum), Bacopa, Hydrocotyle, Eriocaulon and Xyris. These genera speciated within this environment and evolved habitat equivalent species. The reduced size and the spatial isolation of the habitat reduce gene flow and favour allopatric speciation. The variability in time and small-scale ecological gradients stimulate sympatric speciation by temporal separation of the populations. Niche-equivalent taxa replace each other in different parts of the world. The niche of dwarf ephemeroid annuals is occupied by Centrolepidaceae in the Australian region, by Restionaceae in the Capensis, by Eriocaulaceae in the Australian region and East Asia, by Juncaceae in the holarctic kingdom, by Orcuttieae in the Californian phytogeographical sector, and by Cyperaceae, Crassulaceae, Gentianaceae, Elatinaceae and Apiaceae in all floristic kingdoms. Other predominant life forms are herbaceous perennials with the isoetid syndrome, geophytic ferns (Ophioglossum, Marsilea), carnivorous plants from the families Lentibulariaceae and Droseraceae, and polkilohydric vascular plants with the xyroid syndrome. The latter occur in the Tropics, with Xyridaceae (pantropical), Velloziaceae (neotropical region), Afrotrilepis, Craterostigma, Lindernia, Chamaegigas (palaeotropical region), Trilepis (neotropical region) and Borya (Australian region). The floristic kingdoms of the world are also reflected in the phytosociological classification of the ephemeral wetland communities. They are further differentiated according to climate zones and altitudinal belts. High ranked syntaxa in the New World are the Beckmannio syzigachne-Rumicetalia salicifolii (temperate regions of North America), Downingio bicornutae-Lasthenietea fremontii (Californian phytogeographical province), Mayacetea fluviatilis, Xyridetea savanensis and Leptocoryphio-Trachypogonetea (neotropical lowlands from Cuba via the Guiana Shield to northern Argentina), and Limoselletea australis (Andean belt in the neotropical region, lowlands in the extratropical parts of South America). The communities in the Western Palaearctis belong to the Isoeto-Nanojuncetea. Within this class, two orders can be separated according to species combination, ecology, predominant life form and phenology: Isoetetalia in the Mediterranean area and Cyperetalia fusci in the temperate zone of Eastern and Central Eurasia. Amphibic vegetation on mud soils in East Asia belongs to the Lindernion procumbentis, on nutrient poor soils to Eriocaulion atratae (Northern Japan) and Eriocaulion hondoensis (Southern Japan). Seasonal waterlogged soils in arctic and subarctic climates, often kept open by cryoturbation, are colonized by Koenigia islandica-communities. In subsaharan Africa, observations are scanty for the montane and subalpine zones of Eastern Africa (Limoselletea africanae) and preliminary for Southern Africa. In West Africa, the vegetation of ephemeral flush sites on inselbergs and of seasonal ponds in plains is better known. Communities on meso- and eutrophic sites there belong to the Rhamphicarpo fistulosae-Hygrophiletea senegalensis, on oligotrophic sites to the Drosero-Xyridetea. The latter class ranges throughout inselbergs in Central and Eastern Africa. Seasonal waterlogged soils in Central African lowlands are colonized by the Microchloetea indicae. Southwestern outposts of this class occur in Namibia. A high degree of endemism characterizes the Centrolepidi aristatae-Hydrocolyletea alatae, distributed in the mediterranean climate of SW Australia, and the Crassulo sinclairii-Hydrocotyletea hydrophilae, which occur in New Zealand. Communities with Lilaeopsis polyantha are distributed from Tasmania to SE Australia. Vegetation zonation according to water depth, periods of inundation and time of emergence is a characteristic feature of temporary ponds and emergent shorelines. Other differentiating gradients can be soil depth and water storage capacity (on rock outcrops), duration of seepage water flow (on inselbergs), wave respectively ice scour intensity (in the shoreline habitat), frost-heaving intensity (in subarctic and oreotropical climates) and salinity (in endorheic playa lakes in arid and semi-arid climates). These environmental gradients result in repetitive patterns of contact series of plant communities (= zonation complexes). Inundation experiments and seed bank analysis show that in a given year, only part of the seeds are stimulated to germinate. At a given place different plant communities can be awakened by different flooding regimes. The seed bank makes the temporary wetland ecosystems resilient to the interannual variability of ponding. Seasonal dynamics and year-to-year variability are prominent attributes of ephemeral wetland vegetation. A high species turnover in the growing season allows to separate ecophases respectively chronocoenoses. Plant response to drought is individualistic and depends largely on the timing of meteorological events in relation to life-stages. Such a germination and sprouting ecology can explain the year-to-year fluctuations of vegetation zones. Interannual variability is greater on shallow soils and more accentuated in the summer ecophases respectively increases from the pool centre to the margins. The habitats are not submitted to progressive succession, when they are of primary nature and when the natural dynamic of the hydrological or geomorphological process continues. Temporary wetlands shelter extremely rare and isolated taxa. The habitats are sensitive to human impact and they are threatened in many parts of the world. A strong decline can be stated for many species in Central Europe. The main reasons are missing dynamics of the river systems, abandonment of extensive pasturing and - in consequence - rare soil disturbance. Some species shift from primary to man-made habitats such as drained fish-ponds, arable land, rice fields and irrigated turfs. First tendencies of a globalization of the ephemeral wetland flora can be observed.																			0340-269X	2363-7153				AUG 26	2005	35	2-3					533	705		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-0533													WOS:000231718000017
J	Baron, JS; Caine, N				Baron, JS; Caine, N			Temporal coherence of two alpine lake basins of the Colorado Front Range, USA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Knowledge of synchrony in trends is important to determining regional responses of lakes to disturbances such as atmospheric deposition and climate change. We explored the temporal coherence of physical and chemical characteristics of two series of mostly alpine lakes in nearby basins of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Using year-to-year variation over a 10-year period, we asked whether lakes more similar in exposure to the atmosphere behaved more similarly than those with greater influence of catchment or in-lake processes. 2. The Green Lakes Valley and Loch Vale Watershed are steeply incised basins with strong altitudinal gradients. There are glaciers at the heads of each catchment. The eight lakes studied are small, shallow and typically ice-covered for more than half the year. Snowmelt is the dominant hydrological event each year, flushing about 70% of the annual discharge from each lake between April and mid-fury. The lakes do not thermally stratify during the period of open water. Data from these lakes included surface water temperature, sulphate, nitrate, calcium, silica, bicarbonate alkalinity and conductivity. 3. Coherence was estimated by Pearson's correlation coefficient between lake pairs for each of the different variables. Despite close geographical proximity, there was not a strong direct signal from climatic or atmospheric conditions across all lakes in the study. Individual lake characteristics overwhelmed regional responses. Temporal coherence was higher for lakes within each basin than between basins and was highest for nearest neighbours. 4. Among the Green Lakes, conductivity, alkalinity and temperature were temporally coherent, suggesting that these lakes were sensitive to climate fluctuations. Water temperature is indicative of air temperature, and conductivity and alkalinity concentrations are indicative of dilution from the amount of precipitation flushed through by snowmelt. 5. In Loch Vale, calcium, conductivity, nitrate, sulphate and alkalinity were temporally coherent, while silica and temperature were not. This suggests that external influences are attenuated by internal catchment and lake processes in Loch Vale lakes. Calcium and sulphate are primarily weathering products, but sulphate derives both from deposition and from mineral weathering. Different proportions of snowmelt versus groundwater in different years could influence summer lake concentrations. Nitrate is elevated in lake waters from atmospheric deposition, but the internal dynamics of nitrate and silica may be controlled by lake food webs. Temperature is attenuated by inconsistently different climates across altitude and glacial meltwaters. 6. It appears that, while the lakes in the two basins are topographically close, geologically and morphologically similar, and often connected by streams, only some attributes are temporally coherent. Catchment and in-lake processes influenced temporal patterns, especially for temperature, alkalinity and silica. Montane lakes with high altitudinal gradients may be particularly prone to local controls compared to systems where coherence is more obvious.

J	Glamuzina, M; Siljkovic, Z; Mamut, M				Glamuzina, M; Siljkovic, Z; Mamut, M			Modern transformation in the area of coastal zone of the Neretva delta under the influence of melioration and hydrotechnical intervention	PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM					Conference on Responsible Coastal Zone Management - The Challenge of the 21st Century (LITTORAL 2000)	2000	CROATIA	EUROCOAST Croatia, Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Univ Split, Fac Econ, State Hydrog Inst, Int Ctr Croatian Univ				The Neretva river is the longest river of the Adriatic basin that rises (springs) far from the coastal mountains (200 km) and cut the bed transversally into the Dinarides and flows into The Adriatic Sea near the port of Ploce. On a longitude of 25 km, it becomes valley-river that flows slowly, meanders, bifurcates into more streams and makes overflowed (swamp) areas, lakes, lagoons, in other words, the delta appears. The most remarkable forms of delta have disappeared in the area from Opuzen to the rivermouth and before constructing of the defense-embankment was mostly under sea level and overflowed in the tide. There were a number of small streams as well as Lake Modric, Glog, Zivotina, Palinic and others, known as habitus of sea and river fish and many kinds of birds. All that disappeared by the process of melioration. It was a decision at the time of romantic enthusiasm to destroy malaria as soon as possible and to raise the standard of living. It was obvious that by disappearance of these swamp species, natural balance was disturbed so that almost whole bird and fish fund disappeared. It is not known when the cultivation of these areas at first started, but it is known that the first melioration on higher areas by the river streams were done by the inhabitants of the delta using hoe and shovel. They created small parcels digging trenches between them, lifting the ground by the dug mud. That process is called "jenderenje" (tur. hendek - endek = trench). The first written news on melioration of the delta is from the Venetian period in the context of recovering of those swamp areas (because of malaria) and turning them into fish-ponds. The first official board for the Neretvian swamps regulation and melioration was founded in Zadar in 1865 (then vice-regency). In 1881 the regulation of the Neretva river begun from the rivermouth to Metkovic by creating one flow and by cutting the meanders, but the swamps still stayed there till the end of the Second World War. In 1948 Agro-Industrial Conglomeration "Neretva" was founded and had a task to meliorate and cultivate swamp areas of the delta from Opuzen to the rivermouth and to expand gradually on whole area of the delta. The task of this paper is to give a review on the processes and changes that occurred on this area immediately by the Adriatic coast under the influence of modem meliorational and agro-technical procedures.																			0031-5362					SEP	2000	102			1			137	145																WOS:000166145900018
J	Cook, SCW; Kennedy, B; Villeneuve, MC				Cook, Stefan C. W.; Kennedy, Ben M.; Villeneuve, Marlene C.			Engineering geology model of the Crater Lake outlet, Mt. Ruapehu, New Zealand, to inform rim breakout hazard	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Mt. Ruapehu, in the central North Island of New Zealand, hosts a hot acidic Crater Lake over the active volcanic vent with a surface elevation of c. 2530 m.a.s.l. Volcanic activity and other montane processes have previously resulted in catastrophic releases of some or all of the c. 10 Mm(3) of water retained in the lake, creating serious hazards downstream. A major lahar in March 2007 exposed a 10 m high face representative of the rock units impounding the lake, providing an opportunity to conduct both field and laboratory analysis to characterise the rock mass conditions at the outlet to assess the stability of the outlet area. This paper presents an engineering geology model of Crater Lake outlet. Our model shows three andesitic geological units at the outlet, each with different geological histories and physical and mechanical properties, which impact its stability. Geotechnical methods used to characterise the outlet include laboratory testing of the strength, stiffness, porosity and unit weight, and field-based rock mass characterisation using the geological strength index (GSI) and rock mass rating (RMR). Field observations, geomorphology mapping, historic and contemporary photographs, and laboratory results are combined to create cross sections that provide key information for establishing the engineering geology model. The units are recognised in what is informally termed the Crater Lake Formation: i) The upper surface layer is a c. 2 m thick sub-horizontal dark grey lava unit (Armoured Lava Ledge) with sub-horizontal cooling joints spaced at 0.2 m to 2.0 m intervals. The intact rock has a porosity range of 15-27%, density range of 1723-2101 kg/m(3), GSI range of 45-75, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) range of 19-48 MPa. ii) Below this, and outcropping down the majority of the outlet waterfall is a poorly sorted breccia unit composed of block and matrix material (Lava Breccia). The blocks range from 0.1 m to 0.8 m in diameter with an average porosity of 21%, a density of 1956 kg/m(3) and strength of 85 MPa. The matrix has soil-like properties with an estimated UCS of 1.5 MPa. iii) At the base of the waterfall, the material sharply transitions into a light grey, slightly weathered unit (Lower Grey Member). This lower unit has an irregular surface expression with sub-vertical discontinuities. Porosity is 6%, density is 2569 kg/m(3), the GSI range is 65-75, and the UCS is 98 MPa. The engineering geology model portrays the relationships between the units in three dimensions, highlights key structures and takes into consideration the material source, transportation and depositional processes. Historical outlet photographs suggest past eruptive and glacial activities are both significant factors controlling the deposition and erosion of material at the outlet. The Lower Grey Member appears to be a sound material for the outlet and water fall to be founded on. The upper as Armoured Lava Ledge currently has moderate strength and GSI, and is resistive, providing protection for the underlying weaker block and matrix unit, however, continued incision by the outlet stream will eventually expose the weaker block and matrix material of the Lava Breccia. Once exposed, the Lava Breccia could rapidly erode or fail down to the Lower Grey Member and could potentially release 1 Mm(3) of hot, acidic Crater Lake water. We recommend that erosion rates for the upper Armoured Lava Ledge be established to aid in preparation for eventual rim breakout. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The source-to-sink system of coarse-grained deposits in Lake Chenghai, a deep, scarped Late Quaternary lake, was investigated in this study based on 62 outcrops, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) digital elevation model (DEM) data, and regional geological survey data. The findings include the following: (1) the source areas of coarse-grained deposits in Lake Chenghai were lithologically classified into carbonate source areas, basaltic source areas and siliciclastic source areas, and were geomorphically categorized as scarp type or confluence type. Subaqueous colluvial aprons have formed downstream of the carbonate source areas and scarp-type basaltic source areas, while Gilbert-type deltas have formed downstream of siliciclastic source areas and confluence-type basaltic source areas. (2) The formation and evolution of coarse-grained deposits are controlled by the sediment flux that evolves in synchrony with the geomorphic evolution of the source areas and the sink regimes. Scarps represent the initial landform of the source areas. Source material rolls off or slides down scarps or forms small-scale debris flows before entering the lake. The source material initially formed subaqueous colluvial apron (synonymous with subaqueous fans) where suffi-cient space was present to accommodate sediments and the basement angle exceeded than the natural angle of repose. As weathering and denudation have progressed, the initial scarps have transformed into confluence type slopes, and the source material has formed medium-and large-scale debris flows that have entered the lake, resulting in an increase in sediment flux. Consequently, the subaqueous colluvial aprons have rapidly grown and developed subaerial deposits, which have evolved into larger-scale Gilbert-type deltas that overlie the initial aprons. (3) The morphology and distribution of coarse-grained deposits vary in response to differences in quantity and composition of materials from different source areas, which resulting from different rates of weathering and denudation and different sediment input regimes. Firstly, the size and surface slope angle of a subaqueous colluvial apron from a carbonate source are smaller than those of a subaqueous colluvial apron of basaltic origin. Secondly, a Gilbert-type delta from a basaltic source features a greater slope angle and a thicker topset than does a Gilbert-type delta of siliciclastic origin, and the latter exhibits a longer foreset and a thicker bottomset than in the former. Thirdly, the sizes of subaqueous colluvial aprons are not strongly correlated with the sizes of the source areas, while the sizes of Gilbert-type deltas are.					; Ma, Pengjie/JFJ-7499-2023; HUANG, He-Qing/KHZ-7958-2024; Qiu, Longwei/AAJ-8055-2021; wang, yuzhe/MGA-9238-2025	DONG, Daotao/0000-0002-7095-3056; Ma, Pengjie/0000-0002-4766-1936; huang, he-qing/0009-0002-8334-5962													2095-3836	2524-4507				APR	2022	11	2					194	221		10.1016/j.jop.2022.03.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jop.2022.03.006													WOS:000800490500003
J	Hentschel, A; Esterle, JS; Golding, SD; Pacey, DV				Hentschel, A.; Esterle, J. S.; Golding, S. D.; Pacey, D. V.			Petrologic and stable isotopic study of the Walloon Coal Measures, Surat Basin, Queensland: peat accumulation under changing climate and base level	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												The Late Jurassic Walloon Subgroup (recently dated as Oxfordian) is a productive, subbituminous coal seam gas source in the Surat Basin and can be subdivided from bottom to top into the Taroom Coal Measures, the Tangalooma Sandstone, the Lower and Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which have different coal character. The lower Taroom coals are commonly thick, associated with sandstones and interpreted to form as base level is rising, creating sodden anoxic conditions for peat accumulation. The middle Tangalooma to Lower Juandah contains fewer and thinner coals, and transitions upwards from a sandstone to siltstone dominated sequence responding to inundation with the development of floodplain lakes. The strata then coarsen upward in both grain size and coal thickness in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which may be eroded by an overlying unit, the Springbok Sandstone. This unconformable surface is basin wide and depending on age, can be tied into global changes in climate and base level. Existing models for peat growth under changing base level and the variability in terms of the conditions of peat formation through time, as well as throughout the basin, are tested. Environment of peat deposition and changes therein, are investigated by petrographic analysis of the Walloon coals, coupled with high resolution lithotype logging of core and organic stable carbon isotope analysis. Fine microlayering and abundance of root suberinite, telo- and detrovitrinite indicate precursory peat formation in a mostly herbaceous marsh to fen environment, in which bigger trees are either infrequent or absent, except for the lower seams of the Taroom Coal Measures and the upper seams of the Lower Juandah Coal Measures, where bright bands are thicker (>= 10 mm) and more frequent. No extended periods of dehydration-oxidation (<1 vol.% mmf inertinite group macerals) are indicated until the deposition of the Upper Juandah Coal Measures that contain greater amounts (5 to 15 vol.% mmf with rare 68 vol.%) of inertinite group macerals. Suberinite is interpreted to reflect dense root mats that are resistant to decay by microbial activity. They leave behind their suberinised exoderms, which originally helped wetland plants to protect themselves from deleterious solutes or in case of a change to drier conditions provided protection from desiccation. The most common inertinite maceral found in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures is inertodetrinite, associated with detrovitrinite. After bush or swamp fires, pieces of charcoal on dried out peat surfaces are easily blown away by the wind and accumulate with sediment in standing water. Fusinites and semifusinites are mainly associated with telovitrinites and are likely to be the result of desiccation and (fungal) mouldering in addition to fire. Stable carbon isotopes of coal show a distinct positive shift in the Lower Juandah Coal Measures that sets in well before the increased inertinite content in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures. The enrichment in C-13 could be linked to a change in climate during the high stand depositional cycle, marking the onset of late stage falling, where base level begins to drop, later creating exposures and water stress. A shift to a less humid climate in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures could have favoured the conditions for desiccation, mouldering and bush fires, which is reflected in the coal's maceral composition. The Surat Basin delta C-13 isotope trend follows the global trend found in marine carbonate samples from the same age interval that corroborates increasing enrichment towards the top of the coal measures (approximately middle Oxfordian), followed by a shift to more negative compositions, which corresponds to the onset of the Springbok Sandstone deposition on an unconformable surface.

J	Young, JO; Reynoldson, TB				Young, JO; Reynoldson, TB			Continuing dispersal of freshwater triclads (Platyhelminthes; Turbellaria) in Britain with particular reference to lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A survey of lakes in Anglesey and Snowdonia, Wales, in the summer of 1997 recorded changes in the triclad fauna which had occurred since earlier studies in the 1950s and in 1973. Two native species, Polycelis tenuis and Dugesia polychroa, and two immigrants, Planaria torva and especially Dugesia tigrina, have increased their range. The triclad fauna has remained unchanged With time in eleven out of sixteen lakes in Snowdonia, in contrast to only one out of fourteen lakes on Anglesey. This supports the hypothesis produced in the 1950s, that the triclad fauna of the ion-poor, unproductive lakes in Snowdonia would change little with time, being maintained by ecological interactions, whereas the ion-rich, productive lakes on Anglesey, from which native Dugesia spp. and Dendrocoelum lacteum are historically absent, would increase in triclad diversity. 2. An examination of national records for the distribution of D. tigrina and Pl. torva indicated their continuing dispersal in both still and running waters in mainland Britain, with the former species having the greater frequency of occurrence. 3. The reasons for this may be that D. tigrina is (a) more easily dispersed, (b) a more opportunistic, catholic feeder, (c) a more vigorous competitor, (d) able to reproduce asexually and (e) able to prey to some extent on other triclad species, as shown in the laboratory but not yet confirmed in the field. The absence of D. tigrina and Pl. torva from unproductive lakes may be explained in terms of low temperature and feeding mode, and a low standing crop of gastropods, respectively. 4. Seven surveys (1961-1997) of the triclad fauna (six species) of Colemere, England, revealed that D. tigrina was confined to one small area of the littoral zone until the mid-1980s, after which it spread fairly rapidly to occupy the entire shore by 1997. Its expansion has been to the detriment of all the native species, particularly P. tenuis, except Dd. lacteum. The possible extinction of PI. torva may be linked to a numerical reduction in snails, particularly Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. 5. Dugesia tigrina has an adverse effect on the native triclad fauna in lakes, particularly when only a few species are present. This has been explained in terms of the availability of a wider variety of food. The presence of a larger number of triclad species denies the immigrant food items, particularly crustaceans and snails, the food refuges of Dd. lacteum and Dugesia spp., respectively. However, the long-term study of Colemere has shown that more diverse triclad faunas may also be vulnerable to this immigrant. The effect of Pl. torva on native triclads remains uncertain.																			0046-5070					SEP	1999	42	2					247	262		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444488.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444488.x													WOS:000082837600005

The following paleoclimatic changes characteristic of the southern TP were suggested by comparing with the paleoclimatic records from various regions within the Southwest (SW) monsoon domain on the TP. Soon after the LGM, deglaciation in the southern TP had already started at 18.5 ka BP, and more actively increased after ca. 16.5 ka BP, with the hydrological circulation oscillating in ca. 1200-, 2000- and 4000-year periods. An abrupt increase in humidity under the reduced SW monsoon intensity occurred at 15.0 ka BP as part of further deglaciation processes. Subsequently, the climate amelioration in the southern region started from 15.0 ka BP a few centuries earlier than other regions of the TP and then was further intensified by synchronizing with the Bolling/Allored (B/A) event Over the B/A period, the SW monsoon intensity in the southern region almost continuously and sharply increased. Unlike many regions on the TP, the southern region experienced almost no or substantially small impact of the Younger Dryas (YD) event and also other major dry/cold reversals, such as Heinrich 1 event the 8.2 kyr event, and an abrupt spell occurring between 5 and 4 ka BP. The monsoon intensity in the southern region after the YD event started to rapidly increase from 11.4 ka BP and reached a maximum between 10.8 and 10.0 ka BP after the LGM which lagged about 1200 years behind the maximum Insolation in the northern hemisphere. From ca. 9.6 ka BP, the gradual decrease in humidity in the southern TP started and continued until 42 ka BP. It's aridification trend was characterized by three-stepwise transition observed at 9.6, 7.7 and 5.5 ka BP. However, the aridification in the southern TP was rather weak, and the climatic conditions were sustained fairly humid and comparably stable. The humidity between 4.2 and 2.5 ka BP essentially increased despite the weakened SW monsoon intensity at that time, whereas from 2.5 ka BP to the present, the climatic conditions became most arid and instable during the Holocene. As a consequence, the Holocene climate optimum in the southern region lasted from 11.4 ka BP until 2.5 ka BP and was marked by the earliest start and the latest end timings within the SW monsoon domain on the TP. The comparison of the start timings from various paleoclimatic records indicated that the first SW monsoon on the TP after the YD event generated at 11.4 ka BP in the southern region. Subsequently, according to the degree of the recovery of positive vegetation-albedo feedback system in each region, the monsoon probably extended from the southern TP over the entire TP taking 3000-4000 years. Based on these results, the possible key factors and mechanisms responsible for the paleoclimatic changes in the southern region and also the possible processes as to the evolution of the SW monsoon over the TP are discussed.

J	Ammann, B; von Grafenstein, U; van Raden, UJ				Ammann, Brigitta; von Grafenstein, Ulrich; van Raden, Ulrike J.			Biotic responses to rapid warming about 14,685 yr BP: Introduction to a case study at Gerzensee (Switzerland) Introduction	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The late-glacial climatic warming indicated in the Greenland ice-core record about 14,685 years before 1950 AD belongs to a type of very rapid high-amplitude warming similar the onsets of Dansgaard-Oeschger events during marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3). In order to estimate the nature and rates of change of biotic responses to such a major climatic shift we need a reliable time scale as well as climatic indicators independent of the biota. Both are provided by a high-resolution oxygen-isotope record from precipitated carbonates of lake marl in Gerzensee, Switzerland (van Raden et al., 2013-this issue). On the basis of the assumption of synchronous climatic changes between Greenland and Gerzensee, the close correlation of the oxygen-isotope changes at the two sites allows the use of the NGRIP GICC05-timescale at Gerzensee (with the zero point at 1950 AD to maintain comparability with the numerous radiocarbon dates in Europe). The delta O-18-record measured in precipitated carbonates is checked and refined by the delta O-18 measured in mono-specific ostracod samples (Von Grafenstein et al., 2013-in this issue). The shift of 3.6 parts per thousand delta O-18 PDB in only about 112 years at the end of the GS-2 represents a very rapid temperature increase of at least 6.2 degrees C. This increase is confirmed by reconstructions based on transfer functions for pollen and chironomids by Lotter et al. (2012) (possibly 4-7 degrees C in the annual mean and 2-5 degrees C in summer temperatures). After this major shift the Greenland late-glacial interstadial GI-1 (corresponding to the regional biozones Bolling and Allerod) delta O-18-records of both Greenland and Gerzensee exhibit four minor fluctuations (about 1.0-1.2 parts per thousand delta O-18), of which the second and the fourth are especially clearly correlated with several of terrestrial records in the northern hemisphere. The oxygen-isotope record is used as a template for all these sediment- and bio-stratigraphies. The biotic responses may include at least five types of process: (1) changes in productivity of individuals (within a year or two), (2) changes in populations (usually somewhat slower, depending on life cycles and environmental constraints), (3) changes due to migration (often rather slow, depending again on life cycles and environmental constraints), (4) changes in the terrestrial and aquatic communities and (5) changes on the level of ecosystems (including pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and species interactions). These biotic responses to the early rapid warming about 14.685 ka BP are elaborated in subsequent papers for plants, chironomids, ostracods, and Cladocera (Ammann et al., 2013-in this issue-a; Brooks and Heiri, 2013-this issue; Von Grafenstein et al., 2013-in this issue; Novakova et al., 2013-this issue). In addition, lake levels are reconstructed by Magny (2013-this issue) and vegetation dynamics and N2O-emissions are modelled (Lischke et al., 2013-this issue; Pfeiffer et al., 2013-this issue).

J	Schwalb, A; Burns, SJ; Kelts, K				Schwalb, A; Burns, SJ; Kelts, K			Holocene environments from stable isotope stratigraphy of ostracods and authigenic carbonate in Chilean Altiplano Lakes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					13th International Symposium on Ostracoda (ISO97)	JUL, 1997	UNIV GREENWICH MEDWAY CAMPUS, KENT, ENGLAND		UNIV GREENWICH MEDWAY CAMPUS			Sediment cores from three shallow (<10 m), saline lakes along a transect of the northern Chilean Altiplano (18 degrees S-27 degrees S) document changes in moisture balance for the mid- to late Holocene. Stable isotopic compositions of ostracods and authigenic carbonate were measured to test whether high altitude (>4000 m a.s.l.) paleoclimatic profiles show coherency within tropical-subtropical circulation patterns. Climatic signals however are partially masked by local environmental systems. Results suggest similar arid mid-Holocene to less arid late Holocene trends in the three lakes although each lake shows distinct response characteristics linked to differences in regional moisture balance. Isotopic signatures for each lake group in discrete delta(18)O vs. delta(13)C populations. High isotopic variability results from episodic flooding and brine evolution in the shallow lakes. Laguna Seca (18 degrees 11'S, 69 degrees 14'W, 4500 m a.s.l.) is characterized by a diverse ostracod assemblage of at least 8 species indicating highest moisture levels among the three sites. High delta(13)C values are the result of continuous evasion of CO2 derived from volcanically charged groundwaters and springs plus the formation of travertine and photosynthetic activity in the lake. A 3 parts per thousand decrease in delta(18)O about -4.7 m suggests an abrupt shift to wetter conditions at the transition from mid- to late Holocene. Lagunas Miscanti (23 degrees 44'S, 67 degrees 46'W, 4140 m a.s.l.) and del Negro Francisco (27 degrees 28'S, 69 degrees 14'W, 4125 m a.s.l.) each contain only one ostracod species, Limnocythere sappaensis, attesting to higher salinities, although sediment facies and ostracod continuity and abundances imply a history of higher effective moisture at Laguna del Negro Francisco. Sediment cores from each lake document more arid conditions in the lower sections, with a sharp shift to wetter conditions in the upper sections. Highly variable isotope values at the transition from mid- to late Holocene suggest rapid, short-term climate shifts during this transition. This overall trend can be correlated from Laguna Seca, Laguna Miscanti and Laguna del Negro Francisco to Lago Titicaca implying climatic coherency along the Altiplano. Isotopic profiles show second order fluctuations and drought events that suggest short-term variability along the transect. In order to explain differences in the effective moisture among the three sites we postulate interactions of regional air masses. in the north, convective tropical precipitation dominates Laguna Seca, as for lakes in the Titicaca region. Effective moisture for Lagunas del Negro Francisco and Miscanti follows a south to north gradient generated by cold air masses from 'cut offs' of Pacific Westerlies colliding with moist tropical air masses. Coherent shifts in the past therefore imply changes in available tropical air-mass moisture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Raraku Lake sedimentary record (Easter Island, 27°S)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Easter Island (SE Pacific, 27 degrees S) provides a unique opportunity to reconstruct past climate changes in the South Pacific region based on terrestrial archives. Although the general climate evolution of the south Pacific since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is coherent with terrestrial records in southern South America and Polynesia, the details of the dynamics of the shifting Westerlies, the South Pacific Convergence Zone and the South Pacific Anticyclone during the glacial-interglacial transition and the Holocene, and the large scale controls on precipitation in tropical and extratropical regions remain elusive. Here we present a high-resolution reconstruction of lake dynamics, watershed processes and paleohydrology for the last 34 000 cal yrs BP based on a sedimentological and geochemical multiproxy study of 8 cores from the Raraku Lake sediments constrained by 22 AMS radiocarbon dates. This multicore strategy has reconstructed the sedimentary architecture of the lake infilling and provided a stratigraphic framework to integrate and correlate previous core and vegetation studies conducted in the lake. High lake levels and clastic input dominated sedimentation in Raraku Lake between 34 and 28 cal kyr BP. Sedimentological and geochemical evidences support previously reported pollen data showing a relatively open forest and a cold and relatively humid climate during the Glacial period. Between 28 and 17.3 cal kyr BP, including the LGM period, colder conditions contributed to a reduction of the tree coverage in the island. The coherent climate patterns in subtropical and mid latitudes of Chile and Eastern Island for the LGM (more humid conditions) suggest stronger influence of the Antarctic circumpolar current and an enhancement of the Westerlies. The end of Glacial Period occurred at 17.3 cal kyr BP and was characterized by a sharp decrease in lake level conducive to the development of major flood events and erosion of littoral sediments. Deglaciation (Termination 1) between 17.3 and 12.5 cal kyr BP was characterized by an increase in lake productivity, a decrease in the terrigenous input and a rapid lake level recovery, inaugurating a period of intermediate lake levels, dominance of organic deposition and algal lamination. The timing and duration of deglaciation events in Easter Island broadly agree with other mid- and low-latitude circum South Pacific terrestrial records. The transition to the Holocene was characterized by lower lake levels. The lake level dropped during the early Holocene (ca 9.5 cal kyr BP) and swamp and shallow lake conditions dominated till mid Holocene, partially favored by the infilling of the lacustrine basin. During the mid- to late-Holocene drought phases led to periods of persistent low water table, subaerial exposure and erosion, generating a sedimentary hiatus in the Raraku sequence, from 4.2 to 0.8 cal kyr BP. The presence of this dry mid Holocene phase, also identified in low Andean latitudes and in Patagonian mid latitudes, suggests that the shift of storm tracks caused by changes in the austral summer insolation or forced by "El Nino-like" dominant conditions have occurred at a regional scale. The palm deforestation of the Easter Island, attributed to the human impact could have started earlier, during the 4.2-0.8 cal kyr BP sedimentary gap. Our paleoclimatic data provides insights about the climate scenarios that could favor the arrival of the Polynesian people to the island. If itoccurred at ca AD 800 it coincided with the warmer conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whereas if it took placeat ca AD 1300 it was favored by enhanced westerlies at the onset of the Little Ice Age. Changes in land uses (farming, intensive cattle) during the last century had a large impact in the hydrology and limnology (eutrophication) of the lake. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wendte, J; Al-Aasm, I; Chi, GX; Sargent, D				Wendte, Jack; Al-Aasm, Ihsan; Chi, Guoxiang; Sargent, David			Fault/fracture controlled hydrothermal dolomitization and associated diagenesis of the Upper Devonian Jean Marie Member (Redknife Formation) in the July Lake area of northeastern British Columbia	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Jean Marie in the July Lake area of northeastern British Columbia consists of mainly limestones and partially dolomitized limestones, with variable dolomite content and porosity of dissolutional origin. Pure dolostones occur as metre-thick bodies, at the very top of the Jean Marie in only a few wells. Dolomite also occurs as a selective replacement of internal sediment infilling fractures. This mode of occurrence, as well as the patchy distribution of pure dolostones at the very top of the Jean Marie, suggests that matrix replacement dolomites formed from fluids that were delivered from flow through a vertical, or near-vertical, fault-conduit system, rather than from fluids that were delivered from flow laterally through matrix pores in a stratal-controlled system. Later mineral phases, including (in paragenetic order) saddle dolomite cement, sphalerite, dickite and barite, are also interpreted as part of the fault/fracture controlled system of diagenesis. The homogenization temperatures of saddle dolomite range from 80 degrees C to 163 degrees C and those of sphalerite and barite, collectively, from 55 degrees C to 126 degrees C, with a broad range of calculated salinities for all these phases ranging from approximately 9.0 to 27.0 wt.% NaCl + CaCl(2) equivalent. The wide range of salinities for these phases is interpreted to be from the mixing of evaporative brines with less saline formation waters away from the fault/fracture conduits. The delta(13)C and delta(18)O values for a combined set of matrix replacement dolomites and saddle dolomites fall along a covariant linear trend, suggesting both phases formed from fluids with similar isotopic compositions. Using the oxygen isotopic composition calculated for fluids from which saddle dolomite formed (+0.7 parts per thousand SMOW), crystallization temperatures for matrix replacement dolomites of approximately 80 degrees C to 100 degrees C were calculated from the range of delta(18)O values. The range of crystallization temperatures for both matrix replacement dolomites and saddle dolomites far exceeds the ambient formation temperature at the time of dolomitization or dolomite cementation, estimated to be no higher than 50 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Thus, the formation of both matrix replacement dolomites and saddle dolomite cements conforms to the standard for inferring a hydrothermal origin. The estimated range of ambient formation temperatures suggests an interval of hydrothermal diagenesis possibly starting as early as latest Devonian and continuing into the early Mississippian, at burial depths no deeper than approximately 900 m. The parent fluids for the hydrothermal phase are interpreted to be residual evaporitic brines. During latest Devonian to early Mississippian time, heated brines flowed up through fault-controlled conduits, bypassing approximately 850 m of overlying shale and basinal limestone, into the Jean Marie Member until the flow was impeded by the overlying impermeable shales of the informal upper member of the Redknife Formation. The brines then moved laterally into permeable limestones with grain-support matrices of the upper transgressive-regressive (T-R) cycle of the Jean Marie. This resulted in the formation of scattered metre-thick dolostones at the top of the Jean Marie, and the partial dolomitization of limestones away from the faults.																			0007-4802					SEP	2009	57	3					275	322		10.2113/gscpgbull.57.3.275	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gscpgbull.57.3.275													WOS:000279303400003

B05408	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												[1] The relationship of strain accumulation to strain release over different timescales provides insight to the dynamics, structural development, and spatial and temporal pattern of earthquake recurrence in regions of active tectonics. The Great Basin physiographic province of the western United States is one of the Earth's broadest regions of ongoing continental extension, encompassing an area reaching similar to 800 km in width between the Sierra Nevada to the west and Wasatch mountains to the east. We present observations arising from excavations, scarp profiling, optically stimulated luminescence, and radiocarbon dating to place limits on the late Pleistocene paleoseismic history of faults bounding eight ranges across the interior of the northern Great Basin, specifically, the Shawave, Hot Springs, Humboldt, Sonoma, Shoshone, Tuscarora, Dry Hills, and Pequop ranges. Combining the observations with similar previously published studies within and at the margins of the Great Basin yields a transect that extends eastward across the basin between the 40th and 41st parallels. The sum of observations provides a picture of the patterns and rates of earthquake recurrence over the region during the last similar to 20 - 45 kyr that may be compared to patterns of contemporary seismicity and recently reported measures of strain accumulation across the area using GPS. The recurrence rate of large surface rupture paleoearthquakes along ranges at the margins of the Great Basin is systematically greater than observed along ranges in the interior. The pattern is similar to seismological and geodetic measurements that show levels of background seismicity and strain accumulation are also concentrated along the margins of the Great Basin. An east-west extension rate across the interior of the Great Basin on the order of 1/2 mm yr(-1) ( strain rate of similar to 1 nstrain yr(-1)) over the last similar to 20 - 45 kyr is estimated by summing the record of paleoseismic displacements across the 400 km breadth of the transect, as compared to similar to 2 mm yr(-1) of strain accumulation indicated by a recently reported analysis of a collinear GPS survey. The comparison is hindered by significant uncertainties coupled to the geologic rate estimate. The transect also crosses the northern limit of the central Nevada seismic belt. The central Nevada seismic belt is defined by a north-northeast trending alignment of historical surface rupture earthquakes, increased levels of background seismicity, and strain accumulation rates greater than observed elsewhere in the interior of the Great Basin. The reported recurrence rate of late Pleistocene surface rupture earthquakes within the central Nevada seismic belt is also generally greater than observed along our transect. The observations when taken together suggest that the characteristics of strain release observed historically within the central Nevada seismic belt have been operative over the latest Pleistocene and that the apparently greater rates of strain accumulation and release in the central Nevada seismic belt are diminished or less localized in regions to the north and east. Thus, while the historical alignment of surface ruptures that defines the central Nevada seismic belt remains a unique clustering of earthquakes in time and space, the likelihood of the cluster at its observed location appears greater than would be expected to the north or eastward in the interior of the Great Basin.

J	EVANS, MW; SNYDER, SW; HINE, AC				EVANS, MW; SNYDER, SW; HINE, AC			HIGH-RESOLUTION SEISMIC EXPRESSION OF KARST EVOLUTION WITHIN THE UPPER FLORIDIAN AQUIFER SYSTEM - CROOKED LAKE, POLK COUNTY, FLORIDA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH SECTION B-STRATIGRAPHY AND GLOBAL STUDIES												We collected 43 km of high resolution seismic reflection profiles from a 14.5-hectare lake in the central Florida sinkhole district and data from three adjacent boreholes to determine the relationship between falling lake levels and the underlying karst stratigraphy. The lake is separated from karstified Paleogene to early Neogene carbonates by 65-80 m of siliciclastic sands and clays. The carbonate and clastic strata include three aquifer systems separated by clay-confining units: a surficial aquifer system (fine to medium quartz sand in the upper 20-30 m), the 25-35 m thick intermediate aquifer system (in Neogene siliciclastics), and the highly permeable upper Floridan aquifer system in Paleogene to early Neogene limestones. Hydraulic connection between these aquifer systems is indicated by superjacent karst structures throughout the section. Collapse zones of up to 1000 m in diameter and > 50 m depth extend downward from a prominent Middle Miocene unconformity into Oligocene and Upper Eocene limestones. Smaller sinkholes (30-100 m diameter, 10-25 m depth) are present in Middle to Late Neogene clays, sands, and carbonates and extend downward to or below the Middle Miocene unconformity. Filled and open shafts (30-40 m diameter; 10-25 m depth) ring the lake margin and overlie subsurface karst features. The large collapse zones are localized along a northeast-southwest line in the northern ponds and disrupt or deform Neogene to Quaternary strata and at least 50 m of the underlying Paleogene carbonate rocks. The timing and vertical distribution of karst structures are used to formulate a four-stage model that emphasizes stratigraphic and hydrogeologic co-evolution. (1) Fracture-selective shallow karst features formed on Paleogene/early Neogene carbonates. (2) Widespread karstification was limited by deposition of Middle Miocene clays, but vertical karst propagation continued and was focused because of the topographic effects of antecedent karst. (3) Groundwater heads, increase with the deposition of thick sequences of clastics over the semipermeable clays during Middle and Late Neogene time. The higher water table and groundwater heads allowed the accumulation of acidic, organic-rich soils and chemically aggressive waters that percolated down to Paleogene carbonates via localized karst features. (4) After sufficient subsurface dissolution, the Paleogene carbonates collapsed, causing disruption and deformation of overlying strata. The seismic profiles document an episodic, vertically progressive karst that allows localized vertical leakage through the clay-confining units. The spatial and temporal karst distribution is a result of deposition of sediments with different permeabilities during high sea levels and enhanced karst dissolution during low sea levels. Recent decreases in the potentiometric elevation of the Floridan Aquifer System simulates a sea-level lowstand, suggesting that karst dissolution will increase in frequency and magnitude.																			1073-1318					MAY 16	1994	64	2					232	244																WOS:A1994NQ20600013

NHC) IN THE PLITVICE LAKES NATIONAL PARK	SUMARSKI LIST												The paper presents the first results of monitoring Natura 2000 habitat type 91E0*in the Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatia). This type is represented in black alder forests (Alnus glutinosa /L./ Gaertn.) on an area of 44 ha. There, following the Braun-Blanquet method (1964), 25 plots were set up and releves made, with 175 species of higher plant species recorded. Their environmental and sociological features suggest wetland and periodically flooded habitats with high ground water levels throughout the year, hence hygrophytes are decisive for the community structure. In addition, there is a moderate share of mesophilic species that are not present in the wetland black alder forests along the Sava and Drava rivers in the lowland part of northern Croatia. A comparison of black alder forests of the Plitvice Lakes NP with other black alder syntaxa in Croatia (Figure 2, Table 3) demonstrates that, together with other alder stands in the Dinaric region of Croatia, they belong to the group of wetland forests of the alliance Alnion glutinosae. Their differentiating species with regard to other syntaxa of the alliances Alnion glutinosae and Alnion incanae in Croatia are Fraxinus excelsior, Daphne mezereum, Viburnum lantana, Cirsium oleraceum, Crepis paludosa, Equisetum arvense, Paris quadrifolia, Thalictrum aquilegifolium, Valeriana dioica, Veratrum album, Acer pseudoplatanus, Chaerophyllum hirsutum, Lonicera xylosteum, Filipendula ulmaria, Knautia drymeia, Cruciata glabra. In addition, the researched stands in the Plitvice Lakes NP demonstrate individuality with regard to other stands of the Croatian Dinarides through the differentiating species of Phalaris arundinacea, Dactylorhiza maculata, Cirsium arvense, Primula vulgaris, Listera ovata, Carex acutiformis, C. paniculata, Succis a pratensis, Gentiana asclepiadea. Black alder forests in the Plitvice Lakes NP were created by successive processes in non-forest areas after their fall out of use (Figure 1). They grow by watercourses in karst depressions with occasionally stagnant surface water. Here the river courses are slowed down and distanced from the slopes and surrounding massifs, hence zonal forests do not have a dominant influence on the floral composition. The researched forests are classified in the class Alnetea glutinosae Br.-Bll. et Tx. 1943, order Alnetalia glutinosae Tx. 1937, and alliance Alnion glutinosae Malcuit 1929. They exhibit greatest similarity to the Central European association Carici acutiformis-Alnetum glutinosae. However, these results should not be generalized for the entire Dinaric region of Croatia. Detailed studies of black alder forests in the Dinarides are pending and their results will determine their nomenclature and syntaxonomic character.

In these settings, many infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are spread through water contaminated with faeces. In remote and low-income settings, source-based water quality improvement includes providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes), or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). Point-of-use water quality improvement interventions include boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection, mainly conducted at home. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve water quality for preventing diarrhoea. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (11 November 2014), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 7 November 2014), MEDLINE (1966 to 10 November 2014), EMBASE (1974 to 10 November 2014), and LILACS (1982 to 7 November 2014). We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked references from identified studies through 11 November 2014. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) comparing interventions aimed at improving the microbiological quality of drinking water with no intervention in children and adults. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We usedmeta-analyses to estimate pooledmeasures of effect, where appropriate, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Forty-five cluster-RCTs, two quasi-RCTs, and eight CBA studies, including over 84,000 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most included studies were conducted in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) (50 studies) with unimproved water sources (30 studies) and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies). The primary outcome in most studies was self-reported diarrhoea, which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding in over 80% of the included studies. Source-based water quality improvements There is currently insufficient evidence to know if source-based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (one cluster-RCT, fiveCBA studies, very lowquality evidence). We found no studies evaluating reliable piped-in water supplies delivered to households. Point-of-use water quality interventions On average, distributing water disinfection products for use at the household level may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (Home chlorination products: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants, low quality evidence; flocculation and disinfection sachets: RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82, four trials, 11,788 participants, moderate quality evidence). However, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect estimates between individual studies. Point-of-use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59, 18 trials, 15,582 participants, moderate quality evidence). Important reductions in diarrhoea episodes were shown with ceramic filters, biosand systems and LifeStraw (R) filters; (Ceramic: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; eight trials, 5763 participants, moderate quality evidence; Biosand: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; four trials, 5504 participants, moderate quality evidence; LifeStraw r : RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants, low quality evidence). Plumbed in filters have only been evaluated in high-income settings (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94, three trials, 1056 participants, fixed effects model). In low-income settings, solar water disinfection (SODIS) by distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants, moderate quality evidence). In subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container. In most cases, the reduction in diarrhoea shown in the studies was evident in settings with improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation. Authors' conclusions Interventions that address the microbial contamination of water at the point-of-use may be important interim measures to improve drinking water quality until homes can be reached with safe, reliable, piped-in water connections. The average estimates of effect for each individual point-of-use intervention generally show important effects. Comparisons between these estimates do not provide evidence of superiority of one intervention over another, as such comparisons are confounded by the study setting, design, and population. Further studies assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. As evidence suggests effectiveness improves with adherence, studies assessing programmatic approaches to optimising coverage and long-term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations could also help strategies to improve health outcomes.

In East Asia, scientists often rely on geological proxies such as tree rings, ice cores, and lake sediments to study historical temperature changes. However, high-resolution absolute temperature records remain limited, and many reconstructions may be affected by seasonal biases related to growth or deposition processes. Cave monitoring studies have shown that cave temperatures closely align with local annual averages, making stalagmite fluid inclusions a promising tool for reconstructing past temperatures with reduced seasonal biases. By integrating hydrological and climatic proxies such as hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, carbon isotopes, and trace elements, stalagmite fluid inclusions offer significant potential for detailed studies of regional hydrothermal variations. To improve temperature reconstruction from fluid inclusions, it is essential to calibrate and validate methods using cave monitoring data and recently active stalagmites. This study conducted isotopic analysis of fluid inclusions in modern stalagmites from Shennong Cave (117 degrees 15 ' N, 28 degrees 42 ' E) in southeastern Jiangxi Province, China, to reconstruct temperature. We validated these findings using cave monitoring data collected from June 2022 to December 2023, aiming to confirm the methods and equations used for fluid inclusion temperature reconstruction in Chinese caves. Four actively growing calcite stalagmites (SNN2, SNN3, SNN4, and SNN5) were collected from Shennong Cave. Each stalagmite displayed dripping water and fresh deposits at the top during sampling, confirming active growth and alignment with the uranium-series dating results. The delta D and delta O-18 values of fluid inclusions were analyzed using a system developed by Tian et al. (2020) at Xi'an Jiaotong University, equipped with a Picarro L2140-i water isotope analyzer and a vacuum crushing device. Monitoring data revealed a long-term decline in delta O-18 values of drip water, influenced by the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation, whereas delta O-18 values in carbonate deposits on glass slides fluctuated seasonally. Our findings showed that during the dry season, when cave humidity was low, the actual delta O-18 values in the carbonate deposits exceeded the theoretical values, suggesting that increased ventilation during this period affected delta O-18 fractionation. Correlation analysis indicated that temperature was more strongly correlated with delta O-18 in carbonate deposits than humidity, highlighting temperature as the primary factor regulating variations in carbonate oxygen isotopes. By integrating previous fluid inclusion and isotopic studies of atmospheric precipitation and cave drip water in the Shennong Cave region, we found that isotopes in fluid inclusions and drip water were primarily aligned with the local meteoric water line. Therefore, we used a local meteoric water line equation for the temperature reconstruction. By combining isotopic values from drip water and delta 18O in carbonate deposits with the local meteoric waterline, we reconstructed intermonthly temperature variations within the cave. The reconstructed temperatures closely matched the monitored monthly averages, thereby validating the methods and equations proposed by Johnston et al. (2018). We applied this approach to reconstruct temperatures from four recent stalagmites in the Shennong Cave. The reconstructed annual mean temperatures fell within the range of seasonal variations observed in modern cave temperatures, with a 4 degrees C difference between the Little Ice Age and post-industrial periods. This variation is consistent with the historical reconstruction of eastern China, although it has a slightly broader range. Preliminary cave monitoring data also enabled us to establish an empirical temperature calculation formula specific to Shennong Cave. Further research will incorporate additional cave monitoring and fluid inclusion isotopic data to refine this formula for broader application across the Asian monsoon region. This study provides critical technical and theoretical support for paleotemperature reconstruction using stalagmite fluid inclusions throughout the Asian monsoon region.																			0023-074X	2095-9419					2025	70	2					275	287		10.1360/TB-2024-0726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2024-0726													WOS:001422426200011
J	Soons, JM; Moar, NT; Shulmeister, J; Wilson, HD; Carter, JA				Soons, JM; Moar, NT; Shulmeister, J; Wilson, HD; Carter, JA			Quaternary vegetation and climate changes on Banks Peninsula, South Island, New Zealand	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Late Quaternary terrestrial and marine pollen records from the Canterbury Plains and Banks Peninsula suggest that climates during the peak of Marine Isotope Stage 7 (MIS 7) were similar to those prevailing during stage 5e and the Holocene. Podocarp forest (notably Prumnopitys taxifolia-matai) characterises each interglaciation. In contrast, marine records from DSDP 594 cores, off the cast coast of Canterbury, indicate that stage 7 was dominated by montane forest (Libocedrus sp. and Phyllocladus). This suggests temperatures as much as 3 degreesC colder than indicated by the Banks Peninsula assemblage. Age control from both sites appears to be robust. Some of the differences may be related to the taphonomy of the pollen at both sites. DSDP 594 may reflect a more southerly catchment of fluvially and aeolian-derived pollen than does the Banks Peninsula site. Banks Peninsula was alternately separated from, and joined to, the mainland as Quaternary sea levels fell and rose. Assuming modem ocean current patterns, during interglacials the south-north Southland Current would have swept through the seaway separating the island from the mainland, diverting the flow of rivers embouching on the Canterbury coast, and moving sediments and fluvially transported pollen northwards. Little of this material would have reached DSDP 594, nor, if wind patterns were similar to those of today, would wind-borne pollen from Banks Peninsula have reached the site. It is probable that vegetation on the Peninsula was consistently distinct from that recorded at DSDP 594, which has a more southerly derivation. In contrast to the high mountain areas of the South Island, the low levels of grass pollen in the available record suggest that the Peninsula retained a woody vegetation over much of its area during glacial periods. This was favoured by the physiography of the area, with a variety of micro-climates, and by the extensive areas available for colonisation at times of low sea level. The podocarp forest of MIS 7 was replaced by an open shrubby vegetation in which Leptospermum and Kunzea (Leptospermum-type pollen) was locally dominant, and in which Plagianthus, Phyllocladus, Coprosma and Myrsine were prominent. Charcoal is associated with this change. Most of the recorded taxa, with the exception of Phyllocladus, are present on the Peninsula today. A gap in the pollen record coincides with the Last Interglacial and Last Glaciation, but a return of forest vegetation is documented in the later Holocene. The reconstructions do not exclude the possibility of a cooler stage 7. They do highlight the importance of excluding local/regional non-climatic effects before interpreting climate change from data sets, and reinforce the necessity of testing marine records against compatible terrestrial ones.

J	Nicic, M; Iguman, S				Nicic, Milos; Iguman, Sanja			Post-socialism and "ordinary" tourism: New Belgrade	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the emerging practices of the "tourism of the ordinary" in the wider frame of post-socialist transformation of Serbia's capital city - Belgrade. By sourcing the inspiration in cultural studies and classics of the studies of the ordinary, focus is directed to the patterns of tourism consumption of practices, places and people that do not fall in the category of tourism attraction. The attention is drawn to New Belgrade (Novi Beograd in Serbian), residential part of Belgrade built predominantly after the Second World War. New Belgrade lacks proper tourism infrastructure, commoditized attractions and consumerable tourism experiences on a large scale. Nevertheless, this part of the city is slowly becoming explored by tourists individually or in organized walking or cycling tours. Visits to New Belgrade are most often connected to alternative or hip visitors and have the allure of both urban exploration and cultural practice, as the tours are offered by specialist architectural organizations or individual guides. By introspecting the case of New Belgrade, this paper attempts to address the prospect that ordinary exist only in relation to the attraction and that its appeal comes from the fact that what is ordinary to someone is attraction to another. Design/methodology/approach - As far as specific approach is concerned, some archival and librarian materials have been analyzed in order to map the territory that is being researched (New Belgrade) and to frame the significance of potential heritagisation (Harrison, 2013) on the built environment and its territory. Further, relevant websites and both primary and secondary resources have been consulted. This mostly refers to the websites of Tourist Organization of Belgrade (TOB) and the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments in Belgrade as two most relevant bodies connecting the urban fabric of the city and its tourism valorization. Findings - In this paper, the authors have tried to demonstrate how tourism of the ordinary might be conducted in urban environment that lacks no tangible resources, whose physical physiognomies are not insignificant and which, in another, alternative tourism regime might be considered attractions. However, in the specific set of characteristics spanning from contested past to ambiguous contemporary valorization, New Belgrade remains an uncharted part of the city for much of the mainstream tourism, leaving its charms for very few visitors, most often engaged in interest of the "ordinary." Originality/value - Although Belgrade is experiencing steady rise in numbers regarding tourist arrivals, length of stay and on-site expenditure, New Belgrade is nowhere to be seen on the map of tourism offer, as per Belgrade's Tourism Organization. TOB's official web page, at the time this piece is written, in the section Attractions, mentions nothing regarding New Belgrade. Among 13 entries - 12 are historic sites of more than a century behind them and one is a lake and outdoor destination.

P.; Hehemann, David; Atkinson, Ian; Wei, Robert			Occurrence and distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Bolgoda and Beira Lakes, Sri Lanka	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The pollution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been widely used to assess the potential impact of anthropogenic activities on aquatic environments because their occurrence in water is closely tied to urban activities. Many PAHs possess mutagenic and carcinogenic properties (Menzie et al. 1992). PAH distribution and toxic potentials have therefore been the focus of numerous studies in waterways including the Great Lakes (USEPA Report 1994), Yanisei Bay (Dahle et al., 2003), and the Fraser River basin (Yunker et al., 2002). Sri Lanka, a small island nation with a dense population of about 20 million people, faces a multitude of environmental stresses ranging from deforestation to traffic congestion and the deterioration of water quality. This study was undertaken to understand the occurrence, sources, and potential impacts of PAHs in the waterways of Sri Lanka. Two lakes, Beira and Bolgoda, were selected for the study due to their economic value and high level of pollution. Beira Lake, situated in downtown Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka, is highly polluted. Sources of pollution are multifarious. For instance, clusters of communities have sprung up along the edges of the lake in recent times and many shacks have been built. These communities are generally not connected to municipal sewer systems and substantial quantities of domestic sewage and untreated wastewaters are discharged directly into the lake. Small industries have also grown rapidly around the lakes, most of which are not believed to have adequate facilities to treat industrial wastewater, especially organic wastes. In addition, Sri Lanka has experienced an upsurge of motor vehicles, including millions of three-wheelers and minivans that are powered by leaded gasoline and diesel fuels. Traffic congestion and severe air pollution due to vehicle emissions are now common daily occurrences and are considered a major potential source of PAHs in the lakes. Although Bolgoda Lake is situated some distance from Colombo, it is heavily polluted due to the growing number of towns with an attendant increase in small businesses and various industries along its shores. These new developments have undoubtedly impacted the lake through the discharge of PAHs and other anthropogenic chemicals present in industrial wastewater and from street runoffs. The lake, additionally, receives a large quantity of pollutants from the industrial zone in the north. The pollution caused by PAHs has led to various studies on the distribution and origin of PAHs in the environment (Yunker et al., 1996; Budzinski et al., 1997). Based on the proportions of different PAHs, most studies aim to distinguish PAHs of petrogenic sources from those of pyrolytic origins. The PAHs of petrogenic origin, prevalent in coals and fossil fuels, are formed from diagenesis of sedimentary organic material under low to moderate temperature and tend to consist of low-molecular-weight PAHs with two to three aromatic rings (Potter et al., 1998). The pyrolytic PAHs, on the other hand, are formed at much higher temperatures (greater than 500 degrees C for example) and consist mainly of four or more aromatic rings (Commins, 1969). Thus, an increase in the proportion of higher-molecular-weight PAHs is taken to be indicative of contaminations of mainly pyrolytic origin. The prevalence of high-molecular-weight PAHs in the urban dusts (Wise et al., 1988) and in atmospheric particles (Sicre et al., 1987) illustrates the chemistry of their formation at high temperature. The purpose of this study was to determine the PAH concentrations and distribution with respect to sampling location, origin and sources in two polluted lakes.																			0007-4861					AUG	2007	79	2					135	140		10.1007/s00128-007-9092-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-007-9092-z								17522750					WOS:000249297300004
J	LOWERY, GH; NEWMAN, RJ				LOWERY, GH; NEWMAN, RJ			A CONTINENTWIDE VIEW OF BIRD MIGRATION OF 4 NIGHTS IN OCTOBER	AUK												A series of two-color and multi-symbol charts based on counts of birds passing before the moon show computed amounts and major directional trends of migration over the United States and southern Canada on 4 successive nights in Oct. The charts permit direct comparison of features of the migration with factors potentially affecting them-the speed and direction of winds aloft, the character of surface weather systems, the disposition of temperature inversions and isothermal layers, and the physiography of the North American continent. Migration traffic in the Far West on these 4 nights is found to be generally inferior in quantity to the flights occurring east of the Rockies under favorable meteorological circumstances. Differences in the quantity and average direction of migration from one far-western observation station to another are too inconsistent-and the stations themselves are too sparse-to support any other generalization except possibly that extremely mountainous terrain produces pronounced local variations. In the Midwest and East, heavy night migrations often extend over vast areas, including several states, and display homogeneity with respect to quantitative rating. Similarly, areas with no detected migration are often far-reaching. Sharp contrasts in migration rating between stations close to one another do occur-and sometimes without clearly evident cause. No effect of physiography asserts itself except for indications that a sizable proportion of migrants may detour the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. In particular, the maps fail to support the idea that migration tends to follow river systems, though the possibility is not precluded that some kinds of migrants may do so. The charts show a variable reaction of migration traffic to the winds aloft selected for comparison. Heavy migration is most frequently associated with following winds, and wind usually seems to affect the direction of migration, even causing reverse movements on occasion; but many exceptions appear. The contention that following winds must be gentle to permit large migrations is contradicted by the present results. Low or falling temperature had no discernible separate influence on the migrations of the four nights except possibly with regard to a movement behind the freeze line in which waterfowl seem to have been prominently involved. Below-average migration traffic was far more frequent than traffic that exceeded the average. The implication is that the greater part of migration through a given area takes place on relatively few nights. The charts furnish no clear indication of the night-to-night advance of migration waves.																				1938-4254					1966	83	4					547	+		10.2307/4083149	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4083149													WOS:A19668492100003

David			Carbon release through abrupt permafrost thaw	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The permafrost zone is expected to be a substantial carbon source to the atmosphere, yet large-scale models currently only simulate gradual changes in seasonally thawed soil. Abrupt thaw will probably occur in <20% of the permafrost zone but could affect half of permafrost carbon through collapsing ground, rapid erosion and landslides. Here, we synthesize the best available information and develop inventory models to simulate abrupt thaw impacts on permafrost carbon balance. Emissions across 2.5 million km(2) of abrupt thaw could provide a similar climate feedback as gradual thaw emissions from the entire 18 million km(2) permafrost region under the warming projection of Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. While models forecast that gradual thaw may lead to net ecosystem carbon uptake under projections of Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, abrupt thaw emissions are likely to offset this potential carbon sink. Active hillslope erosional features will occupy 3% of abrupt thaw terrain by 2300 but emit one-third of abrupt thaw carbon losses. Thaw lakes and wetlands are methane hot spots but their carbon release is partially offset by slowly regrowing vegetation. After considering abrupt thaw stabilization, lake drainage and soil carbon uptake by vegetation regrowth, we conclude that models considering only gradual permafrost thaw are substantially underestimating carbon emissions from thawing permafrost.

J	THORNTON, SE; PILKEY, OH; DOYLE, LJ; WHALING, PJ				THORNTON, SE; PILKEY, OH; DOYLE, LJ; WHALING, PJ			HOLOCENE EVOLUTION OF A COASTAL LAGOON, LAKE OF TUNIS, TUNISIA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Historical records demonstrate that the Lake of Tunis, Tunisia, was an open bay that became separated from the Mediterranean by an accreting barrier spit, forming a lagoon. Closure of the lagoon was caused by increased sedimentation as a consequence of Roman deforestation of the Medjerda River drainage basin to the north and subsequent accelerated longshore transport. The separation of the lagoon from the Mediterranean was completed in the early 1500s. At present, the 48 km2 lagoon averages < 1 m in depth and reaches eutrophic conditions in the late summer. The lagoon sedimentary column shows 3 distinct successive environments of deposition: an arid continental environment; an open marine bay; and the present brackish to hypersaline lagoon. These depositional environments are represented by the lower grey layer, which is < 0.5 m thick, the middle olive-grey layer, which varies from 1-5 m in thickness, and the upper black layer, which is 1 m thick. All of the strata are predominantly silt plus clay, but usually contain at least 10% sand. The lower grey layer consists of pitted quartz sand, with very few abraded, broken molluskan fragments and benthic foraminifera with thick tests. An arid, subaerial depositional environment of latest Pleistocene time best explains these sediment and fossil assemblages. In the middle olive-grey layer, coral, coralline algae, open marine grasses and the dominance of foraminifera over ostracods (expressed as a low percentage of ostracods/ostracods plus foraminifera) attest to a depositional environment of an open marine bay. A sharp increase in the percentage of ostracods/ostracods plus foraminifera and organic C from the middle olive-grey layer to the upper black layer signifies a major change in depositional environment. The predominance of ostracods over foraminifera, abundance of gastropods characteristic of eutrophic conditions, high organic C content and absence of macro-fossils characteristic of open marine conditions clearly indicate that the upper black layer was deposited in a brackish to hypersaline, eutrophic lagoon which has persisted to the present. Seismic records indicate a karstic bedrock surface underlying the lagoon. The surface is marked by considerable relief, and shows a linear depression which may represent an early 16th century ship canal. Heavy metal analyses of total samples in 5 cores demonstrate that Mn and Fe vary randomly, and are apparently derived from natural sources only. Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu and Zn are typically highest in the uppermost unit, which reflects levels of human contamination since closure of the lagoon.																			0037-0746	1365-3091					1980	27	1					79	91		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1980.tb01159.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1980.tb01159.x													WOS:A1980JE35800005

On return stroke currents and remote electromagnetic fields associated with lightning strikes to tall structures: 2. Experiment and model validation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] In this paper, simultaneous GPS time-stamped measurements of the electric and magnetic fields at three distances and of the return stroke current associated with lightning strikes to the Toronto CN Tower (553 m) during the summer of 2005 are presented. The lightning return stroke current was measured using a Rogowski coil installed at a height of 474 m above ground level (AGL). The vertical component of the electric field and the azimuthal component of the magnetic field were measured simultaneously at distances of 2.0 km, 16.8 km, and 50.9 km from the CN Tower. The propagation path from the CN Tower to the first two stations (2.0 and 16.8 km) was along the soil and through the Toronto city, whereas for the third location (50.9 km) the propagation path was nearly entirely across Lake Ontario. The waveforms of the electric and magnetic fields at 16.8 km and 50.9 km exhibit a first zero crossing about 5 mu s after the onset of the return stroke. This early zero crossing is part of a narrow undershoot. For fields at 50.9 km the expected zero crossing at about 40 ms is also observed. Metallic beams and other conducting parts in buildings on which electric and magnetic field sensors were located cause an enhancement effect on the measured fields. Although an enhancement can be identified both on the electric and the magnetic fields, the degree of enhancement is actually more significant for the electric field than for the magnetic field. It is shown that the value of the wave impedance (E-field peak to H-field peak ratio) could give an estimate of the enhancement effect of the building on the electric field. Propagation effects (decrease of field amplitude and increase of its risetime) can also be observed in experimental records. It is shown that the fields at 50.9 km are less affected by such attenuation, compared to those at 16.8 km, presumably because the path of propagation is mostly across Lake Ontario. Measured waveforms are compared with theoretical predictions obtained using the five engineering return stroke models extended to include the presence of the strike object, namely, transmission line (TL), modified transmission line (MTLL and MTLE), Bruce-Golde (BG), and traveling current source (TCS) models. A reasonable agreement is found with all five engineering models for the magnetic field waveforms at the three considered distances, although the peak values of the computed fields are systematically about 25% lower than measured values. None of the models was able to reproduce the early zero crossing and the narrow undershoot. As far as the electric field is concerned, larger differences have been observed between simulations and measurements. This may be due to the fact that the enhancement effect of the building on the electric field is stronger than that on the magnetic field. The expression relating current and field peaks associated with strikes to tall structures is also tested versus obtained sets of experimental data. The overall agreement between the theoretically predicted and the experimentally observed field-to-current ratio is reasonable, although the formula of Bermudez et al. (2005) appears also to underestimate the experimentally measured ratio (by about 25%). This may be due, at least in part, to the enhancement effect of the buildings on which the field measurement antennae were installed.					; Shostak, Volodymyr/M-5819-2018; Rachidi, Farhad/ABB-8946-2020	Pavanello, Davide/0000-0002-2027-4469; Chisholm, William Alexander/0009-0008-1689-958X; Shostak, Volodymyr/0000-0002-4745-4734; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 14	2007	112	D13							D13122	10.1029/2006JD007959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JD007959													WOS:000248030600001
J	Nath, BN; Kunzendorf, H; Plüger, WL				Nath, BN; Kunzendorf, H; Plüger, WL			Influence of provenance, weathering, and sedimentary processes on the elemental ratios of the fine-grained fraction of the bedload sediments from the Vembanad Lake and the adjoining continental shelf, southwest coast of India	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Geochemical studies, comprising twelve major elements and twenty-four trace elements, including the rare earth elements (REE), have been carried out on the < 4 mu m clay size fractions of modern sediments from fluvial and brackish regimes of Vembanad Lake and also the inner continental shelf representing nearshore marine environments. The sediments in the basin are supplied by many small rivers so that large areas of the upper continental crust of the southwestern India can be sampled. Concentrations normalized to the average upper continental crust (UCC) show that the sediments studied are depleted in Rb, K, Ba, Ta, Hf,Na, and Ca and enriched in Cs, U, Th, REEs, Sc, Fe, Co, and Cr. UCC-normalized patterns are strikingly similar for all the three sediment types, probably because of efficient mixing of sedimentary material during weathering, transport, and deposition. The depletion of Na, K, Ca, and Ba in sediments relative to UCC could be attributed to their mobility during weathering. The depletion of Ta and Hf and enrichment of Th, REE, and Sc are probably related to provenance characteristics, and enrichment of U is attributed to oxidation-reduction processes. Shale-normalized REE values reveal steep HREE patterns [(Tb-sample/Tb-shale)/(Yb-sample/Yb-shale)] >> [(La-sample/La-shale)/(Sm-sample/Sm-shale)] and flat LREE patterns. The shale normalized patterns for all the three types of sediments are remarkably similar, with variations in the magnitude of LREE enrichment (La-n/Yb-n varies between 1.72 to 2.57 times that of PAAS). LREE enrichment and steep HREE patterns are attributed to felsic source-rock characteristics. Other geochemical characteristics such as high La/Th and low La/Sc and Th/Sc ratios compared to UCC also support a felsic provenance. Eu/Eu* values for all the three types are little more than 1, which is also a characteristic feature of Archean crust. Furthermore, data plotted on discrimination diagrams of La/Th vs. Hf and La-Th-Sc cluster closer to granite and away from basalt and komatiite and are consistent with source rock geology. Geochemical data have also helped in ascertaining the weathering trends. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) has been used to quantify the degree of weathering. CIA values range between 81 and 94 on a scale of 40-100, indicating a high degree of alteration (fluvial sediments seem to be more altered). On an A-CN-K diagram, the data fall closer to the compositional fields of highly weathered minerals kaolinite, gibbsite, and chlorite. A high degree of weathering is also indicated by other plots such as K2O-Fe2O3-Al2O3 and log K vs. log Rb. The geochemical data are consistent with the studies on clay mineralogy (higher kaolinite) carried out by other authors on the sediments of the same area. Secondary processes seem to affect other geochemical discriminants such as Co, Cr, Ni, and U, as revealed by plots of (1) La/Sc vs. Co/Th and (2) Th-Hf-Co and Co/Th, Cr/Th ratios and makes them unsuitable for determining provenance and tectonic setting.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				SEP	2000	70	5	A				1081	1094		10.1306/100899701081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/100899701081													WOS:000089892900010
J	Wallace, AR				Wallace, AR			Geology of the Ivanhoe Hg-Au district, northern Nevada: Influence of Miocene volcanism, lakes, and active faulting on epithermal mineralization	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												The mercury-gold deposits of the Ivanhoe mining district in northern Nevada formed when middle Miocene rhyolitic volcanism and high-angle faulting disrupted a shallow lacustrine environment. Sinter and replacement mercury deposits formed at and near the paleosurface, and disseminated gold deposits and high-grade gold-silver veins formed beneath the hot spring deposits. The lacustrine environment provided abundant meteoric water; the rhyolites heated the water; and the faults, flow units, and lakebeds provided fluid pathways for the hydrothermal fluids. A shallow lake began to develop in the Ivanhoe area about 16.5 Ma. The lake progressively expanded and covered the entire area with fine-grained lacustrine sediments. Lacustrine sedimentation continued to at least 14.4 Ma, and periodic fluctuations in the size and extent of the lake may have been responses to both climate and nearby volcanism. The eruption of rhyolite and andesite flows and domes periodically disrupted the lacustrine environment and produced interfingered flows and lake sediments. The major pulse of rhyolitic volcanism took place between 15.16+/-0.05 and 14.92+/-0.05 Ma. High-angle faulting began in the basement about 15.2 Ma, penetrated to and disrupted the paleosurface after 15.10+/-0.06 Ma, and largely ceased by 14.92+/-0.05 Ma. Ground motion related to both faulting and volcanism created debris flows and soft-sediment deformation in the lakebeds. Mercury-gold mineralization was coeval with rhyolite volcanism and high-angle faulting, and it took place about 15.2 to 14.9 Ma. At and near the paleosurface, hydrothermal fluids migrated through tuffaceous sediments above relatively impermeable volcanic and Paleozoic units, creating chalcedonic, cinnabar-bearing replacement bodies and sinters. Disseminated gold was deposited in sedimentary and volcanic rocks beneath the mercury deposits, although the hydrologic path between the two ore types is unclear. Higher-grade gold-silver deposits formed in massive rhyolites and Paleozoic quartzites at deeper levels, and these mineralized zones possibly represent the feeder zones for the higher-level deposits. Fluctuations in the ground-water table locally produced hydrothermal oxidation of the near-surface mercury and disseminated gold deposits. The locus of mineralization shifted with time, moving south and east from its inception point in the west-central part of the district. Thus, although mineralization in the district took place during a span of 300,000 years, the duration of mineralization at any one place probably was much shorter. The low-sulfidation deposits of the Ivanhoe district formed at the same time and under similar conditions as those in the nearby Midas district, 15 kin to the northwest, which includes the large, high-grade Ken Snyder gold-silver epithermal vein deposit. The exposures in the Ivanhoe district are interpreted to represent the near-surface example of the paleosurface that originally was present above the Midas mineralizing system. The resulting combined Ivanhoe-Midas model provides an exploration guide for epithermal deposits in similar geologic environments in northern Nevada.																			0361-0128					MAR-APR	2003	98	2					409	424		10.2113/98.2.409	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/98.2.409													WOS:000182417400010
J	Israde-Alcantara, I; Garduño-Monroy, VH				Israde-Alcantara, I; Garduño-Monroy, VH			Lacustrine record in a volcanic intra-arc setting:: the evolution of the Late Neogene Cuitzeo basin system (central-western Mexico, Michoacan)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					International Symposium of IGCP 324 on Global Palaeoenvironmental Archives in Lacustrine Systems (GLOPALS)	NOV 12-18, 1995	ANTOFAGASTA, CHILE	UNESCO, IUGS, IAS				Late Miocene to Quaternary lacustrine and alluvial-lacustrine sequences were deposited in the Charo-Morelia sub-basin, to the south of the recent Cuitzeo lacustrine depocentre (central-western Mexico), where deposition was largely controlled by widespread faulting and block tilting. Moreover, pyroclastic and epiclastic deposits occur throughout the terrigenous and biogenic sequence, which indicates intense synchronous volcanic activity, directly linked to the faulting. The Charo alluvial-lacustrine sequences crop out extensively to the south of the present Cuitzeo Lake and their exposures record the development and spreading of Late Miocene and Pliocene alluvial-lacustrine zones. The resulting sequences are up to 40 m thick and record four major evolutionary stages related with specific tectonic and volcanic events, which caused changes in the basin morphometry and the palaeodrainage conditions. The first of these stages (Late Miocene) caused the generation of small, NE-SW-oriented shallow lacustrine and swampy zones, which resulted from the activity of strike-slip faults with the same orientation. Alluvial deposits and shallow lacustrine diatomaceous horizons were deposited during this stage. The second stage (Early Pliocene) gave rise to the formation of NE-SW-trending basins related to the extensional reactivation of the earlier NE-SW strike-slip faults. Within this second stage the Charo-Morelia lacustrine depocentre became a larger, deeper tropical lake. The planktonic and planktonic-facultative lacustrine diatom floral assemblages record the development during this stage of a major lake transgression, which could be caused both by wetter climate and tectonic watershed and drainage rearrangement. The third and fourth stages (Quaternary) were related to widespread block tilting processes, which were linked to the generation of E-W-oriented extensional faults and which resulted in the shifting and restriction of the larger, perennial, steadier lacustrine zones to the present Cuitzeo Lake. To the south of this lake the sedimentary record of this stage started with widespread fluvial sequences, which erosively overlaid the diatomitic deposits. The lacustrine zones developed during this alluvial-dominated stage were restricted to small depressions and consisted of small lakes and pond-related environments, which were fed by ephemeral fluvial currents. These minor water bodies were infilled and overlain by acidic pyroclastic fall deposits developed during a major volcanic episode which affected the Charo-Morelia sub-basin (fourth stage). The Cuitzeo and other ancient to recent lacustrine systems (i.e. Chapala Lake) evolved in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt as a result of its tectono-volcanic evolution, which largely influenced the highly sensitive lacustrine systems. Therefore, the analysis of the development, sedimentary evolution and shifting of the lacustrine zones may help us to understand the structural evolution of the central Mexican igneous are complex and the ongoing precesses developed along the related major subduction zone which is oblique to the Middle American Trench in the Pacific margin.

Ernest			Geometry and kinematics of the eastern Lake Mead fault system in the Virgin Mountains, Nevada and Arizona	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Lake Mead fault system is a northeast-striking, 130-km-long zone of left-slip in the southeast Great Basin, active from before 16 Ma to Quaternary time. The north-east end of the Lake Mead fault system in the Virgin Mountains of southeast Nevada and northwest Arizona forms a partitioned strain field comprising kinematically linked northeast-striking left-lateral faults, north-striking normal faults, and northwest-striking right-lateral faults. Major faults bound large structural blocks whose internal strain reflects their position within a left step-over of the left-lateral faults. Two north-striking large-displacement normal faults, the Lakeside Mine segment of the South Virgin-White Hills detachment fault and the Piedmont fault, intersect the left step-over from the southwest and northeast, respectively. The left step-over in the Lake Mead fault system therefore corresponds to a right-step in the regional normal fault system. Within the left step-over, displacement transfer between the left-lateral faults and linked normal faults occurs near their junctions, where the left-lateral faults become oblique and normal fault displacement decreases away from the junction. Southward from the center of the step-over in the Virgin Mountains, down-to-the-west normal faults splay northward from left-lateral faults, whereas north and east of the center, down-to-the-east normal faults splay southward from left-lateral faults. Minimum slip is thus in the central part of the left step-over, between east-directed slip to the north and west-directed slip to the south. Attenuation faults parallel or subparallel to bedding cut Lower Paleozoic rocks and are inferred to be early structures that accommodated footwall uplift during the initial stages of extension. Fault-slip data indicate oblique extensional strain within the left step-over in the South Virgin Mountains, manifested as east-west extension; shortening is partitioned between vertical for extension-dominated structural blocks and south-directed for strike-slip faults. Strike-slip faults are oblique to the extension direction due to structural inheritance from NE-striking fabrics in Proterozoic crystalline basement rocks. We hypothesize that (1) during early phases of deformation oblique extension was partitioned to form east-west-extended domains bounded by left-lateral faults of the Lake Mead fault system, from ca. 16 to 14 Ma. (2) Beginning ca. 13 Ma, increased south-directed shortening impinged on the Virgin Mountains and forced uplift, faulting, and overturning along the north and west side of the Virgin Mountains. (3) By ca. 10 Ma, initiation of the younger Hen Spring to Hamblin Bay fault segment of the Lake Mead fault system accommodated westward tectonic escape, and the focus of south-directed shortening transferred to the western Lake Mead region. The shift from early partitioned oblique extension to south-directed shortening may have resulted from initiation of right-lateral shear of the eastern Walker Lane to the west coupled with left-lateral shear along the eastern margin of the Great Basin.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2463-8				2010	463						243	274		10.1130/2010.2463(11)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2463(11)													WOS:000286214300011

In order to assess current water and sediment quality conditions, distribution of various trace metals and heavy metals were determined in river sediments at 23 sampling stations in the watershed. Concentrations of selected heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) in surface and core sediments sites in Lome coastal region were studied in order to understand metal contamination due to industrialization, urbanization, and economic development in Lome. Sediment and water samples were collected in summer 2008. Trace metals and heavy metal concentrations in surface sediments varied from 0.130-0.829 mg/kg for As, 16-125 for Ba, 0.016-0.121 mg/kg for Cd, 3 to 23 mg/kg for Co, 11 to 26 mg/kg for Cr, 3 to 23 mg/kg for Cu, 3-7 mg/kg for Pb, 5 to 44 mg/kg for Ni, 0.063-0.0425 mg/kg for Se, 10 to 35 for Va, and 6 to 26 mg/kg for Zn. The metalloids antimony as well as beryllium, silver, mercury, thallium, and molybdenum showed a value of <2 mg/kg or little variation with regard to base line concentration. The concentration of arsenic in water samples was varied from 3.0 to 6.46 ppm for arsenic in Lake Togo, 3.0 to 4.9 ppm for Mono River samples, 3.4 to 4.0 ppm for Zio River, 3 to 5.92 ppm for Haho River. According to EPA arsenic permissible level [0.1 mg/l] these values show a 31% up to 65 % increase above MCL. The lead average concentrations in water samples were found to be high but they varied. Lead was recorded higher in samples from Haho and Mono Rivers (samples H1[0.04 mg/l], LT10 [0.1 mg/l] and M5[0.5 mg/l]and Z3 [0.07mg/l]). Comparing these values to EPA [MCL0.015 mg/l] the water samples showed a 25% up to 700 % increase above MCL in some locations. Index of Geo-accumulation (I(Geo)) were calculated to assess whether the concentrations observed represent background or contaminated levels. The highest levels of metals were found to be at the confluence of the Mono and Haho River streams, indicating the impact of the effluents of the industrial activity as well as hazardous waste dumping in the vicinity of Lome and other big cities along the rivers. The arsenic retention in the sediments was highly variable and controlled by local processes as a result of the natural weathering process of metamorphic bedrock. Results indicated that the potential toxicity of marine environment can cause adverse biological effects to the biota directly and the human health indirectly through food web chain.																			1018-4619						2011	20	7A					1853	1865																WOS:000292627300018

Strontium isotope constraints on solute sources and mixing dynamics in a large impoundment, South-Central USA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Strontium concentration and isotope composition (Sr-87/Sr-86) are important proxies for tracing solute and suspended load origins in surface water systems, but have not been widely applied to lakes. We determined these proxies, in addition to major ion compositions, in waters collected from Lake Texoma, a large crescent-shaped (concave-west) impoundment on the border of Texas and Oklahoma that marks the downstream culmination of the Upper Red River Basin (URRB), and its major influent rivers. These rivers enter the lake at its southerly and northerly arms and have distinctly different salinities and discharges, respectively: the more saline Red River (mean total dissolved solids, TDS = 2930 mg/L; 1290 mg/L weighted for discharge, Gainesville gauging station) and the fresher Washita River (TDS = 634 mg/L; 376 mg/L weighted for discharge, Dickson gauging station). These two influent river systems combine to mix in the deepest (main) part of the lake. The URRB involves a heterogeneous mix of bedrock geologies, notably high solubility Permian marine evaporites (gypsum, halite) and carbonates, and riverine solute load and composition can vary accordingly with regional precipitation. Most river and lake waters show an strong positive correlation between Sr-87/Sr-86 and 1/Sr. Red River system waters have variable Sr-87/Sr-86 values, ranging from 0.7076 to 0.7097 (n = 34), whereas the Washita River system appears to be less isotopically variable, with Sr-87/Sr-86 values ranging from 0.7082 to 0.7087 (n = 16). lake Texoma Sr-87/Sr-86 varies spatially between 0.7087 and 0.7092, reflecting mixing of the two input rivers. Variations in Sr isotope composition, Ca/Na and Sr/Ca of river and lake waters are consistent with the majority of the solute load being derived from dissolution of Permian marine chemical sediments, dominantly halite with lesser gypsum. Waters with Sr isotope composition more radiogenic than Permian seawater reflect the contribution of Permian and Pennsylvanian siliciclastic sediments in the case of the Red River watershed, and Precambrian granite in the Washita River watershed. In the main lake water column, Sr concentrations and filtered Sr-87/Sr-86 increase substantially with depth during summer stratification (from 0.7087 to 0.7091), likely reflecting desorption of Sr from suspended solid surfaces and breakdown of oxyhydroxides below the metalimnion. The differences in Sr-87/Sr-86 between filtered and unfiltered aliquots suggest that Sr associated with the suspended load (calcite) is either less radiogenic than the dissolved load or more radiogenic than surface waters but only released to the dissolved pool under deeper reducing conditions below the metalimnion. Either possibility has important implications for Sr cycling in binary mixing models and paleolake reconstruction from Sr isotopes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, integrated studies are being conducted to understand the response of dust emission and deposition to climatic and land-use change in the and southwestern United States. Several approaches are taken to monitor wind erosion and characterize modem dust - its sources, flux, and composition - to document the potential for desertification under future climatic conditions. Wind erosion is monitored at ecologically sensitive sites, using meteorological stations that measure sand flux within the saltation layer. Dust deposition is also monitored at these and many other sites using different types of dust collectors. In addition, new remote sensing methods detect the location, frequency, magnitude, and duration of large dust-emission events. Remotely sensed images of vegetation change, combined with those that illustrate high soil reflectivity, complement dust-detection methods to identify areas especially susceptible to wind erosion. Dust trapped in collectors and in snow is characterized for its physical, mineralogic, and chemical properties. Combined with soil and weather data, such characterization sheds light on: (1) the relation between dust storms and synoptic climatic conditions; (2) the importance of Owens (dry) Lake (California) as a dominant source of southwestern U.S. dust, for as much as 400 km downwind; (3) the impacts of human disturbances in the desert, revealed by signatures of agricultural and construction dust; and (4) the composition and flux of regional background dust composition and flux. Past dust flux is studied from late Quaternary eolian deposits, partly using a new combination of magnetic and chemical methods developed to recognize eolian dust in soils and surficial deposits over large regions. Such studies have applications to understanding current plant distribution, substrates for biologic soil crust, and paleoenvironmental histories of ecosystems. A wind-erosion model based on wind strength, atmospheric shear stress on the surface, and atmospheric stability is being developed. This model will be constrained by remote sensing and ground-based observations and will then be linked with a regional climate model and interactive vegetation package to forecast how various climatic and land-use scenarios interact with critical wind speeds required to move surface materials. We will attempt to answer the following questions: How does wind strength vary with natural climate cycles on decadal and century time scales? To what extent will winds become stronger or weaker under future climate scenarios? How have soil moisture and vegetation changes affected wind erosion in the past, and what can we expect in the future? As an example of possible future conditions, projections of doubled atmospheric CO2 (above pre-industrial levels) for the southwestern U.S. suggest a decrease in winter soil moisture, which may enhance wind erosion.

J	TOFT, CA				TOFT, CA			A 10-YEAR DEMOGRAPHIC-STUDY OF RABBITBRUSH (CHRYSOTHAMNUS-NAUSEOSUS) - GROWTH, SURVIVAL AND WATER LIMITATION	OECOLOGIA												A population of 126 adult rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus var. consimilis) was followed for 10 consecutive years from 1983 through 1992 in a sand-dune ecosystem on the north shore of Mono Lake, California. The study area received an average (1981-1992) of 160 mm total annual precipitation of which 55 mm fell from April through October, making this site drier than other known sites in the Great Basin desert where C. nauseosus occurs. Cover of all shrubs was 18.0%, and that of C. nauseosus 7.5%, in the 3077 m(2) study plot. Water was limiting for this population of C. nauseosus, exerting large effects on new canopy growth and reproductive effort in a given year, on survival, and on establishment of juveniles into the adult population. Growth and survivorship of the adult shrubs were significantly correlated with the depth to ground water, which varied from 3.6 to 6.0 m below the surface during the study, and not with any measure of precipitation in a given year or adjacent years. Shrubs in this population exhibited a net decrease in size between 1983 and 1992. The region experienced a significant drought from 1987 onwards, with some increase in precipitation after 1990. Mortality of shrubs began in 1987 and reached 27% by 1992. Individuals that died were smaller on average initially than individuals surviving throughout the study: 50% or more of the individuals having 4000 cm(2) of canopy or less at the start of the study died by 1992. Elevation (m msl) of each shrub in the study area, presumably correlated with depth to ground water, had no effect on growth but a weak effect on survival during the study period. Specific microsite had significant effects, with shrubs on steep slopes being smaller, having more negative ''growth'' slopes, and being more likely to die during the drought compared to individuals occurring on flatter gradients. Recruitment of juveniles into the population did not occur after 1985. Competition between shrubs could not be definitively demonstrated during the study, but only indirect tests for competition were used. Adult C. nauseosus and adults of all species combined (Sarcobatus vermiculatus with 9.6% cover, Tetradymia tetrameres with 0.8% cover and Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus with 0.02% cover) were randomly distributed, failing to support the hypothesis of competition if competition for water results in a uniform distribution of shrubs. Moreover, comparison of the spatial dispersion of C. nauseosus individuals before (1985) and after (1992) mortality did not reveal competitive thinning toward uniformity. On the other hand, larger individuals were farther from their nearest neighbor than were smaller individuals, an effect postulated to result from competitive thinning.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JAN	1995	101	1					1	12		10.1007/BF00328893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00328893								28306969					WOS:A1995QE05400001

Computational fluid dynamics modeling of the structural influences on offshore wind measurements at the Cleveland water intake crib in Lake Erie	WIND ENGINEERING												Installation of dedicated offshore meteorological tower is very expensive due to the water depth and in some locations, icing conditions. However, many port cities have existing offshore structures such as water intake facilities or historical coastal defense structures that could be utilized as a low-cost alternative for wind resource assessment studies. Such a study was conducted using the city of Cleveland's Water Division water intake facility located 3.5miles offshore of downtown Cleveland in Lake Erie. Lake Erie is the smallest of the Great Lakes and as such can completely ice over during the winter. The water intake crib was installed in 1904 and has a small building on top of the water intake pipe. In 2005, a meteorological tower was installed on top of this building and has been recording wind measurements at 30, 40, and 50m above the nominal water level. The influence of this structure on the recorded wind measurements was assessed using a computational fluid dynamics model. The assessment was conducted across the eight cardinal and ordinal directions and evaluated as a function of incoming wind profile. The model assumed a neutral boundary condition and the standard power law equation was used to predict the true mean wind speeds and wind shear coefficients. Input wind profiles with programmed wind shear coefficients of 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2 were found to be reduced above the crib structure and resulted in wind shear coefficients of -0.07, 0.05, and 0.17, respectively, at the locations of the cup anemometer measurements. This reduction of wind shear coefficient values was found to be caused by an increase in the wind speed above the building, which affected the lower height measurements more than the upper height measurements. The relationship between the known programmed wind shear coefficients and the lower resultant wind shear coefficients predicted from the computational fluid dynamics model was then used to adjust the experimental measurements to correct historical data. The corrected mean wind speeds occurring during a 2-year period beginning in October 2005 at 30, 40, and 50m are 6.79, 7.02, and 7.16ms(-1), respectively, as compared to the previously reported values of 7.14, 7.25, and 7.34 at 30, 40, and 50m, respectively. These values represented the wind speeds which would have been measured using an isolated 50m meteorological mast positioned directly on the water's surface rather than atop the offshore water intake building. The wind shear coefficient averaged over the corrected wind speeds was 0.1038 as compared to the previously reported value of 0.0541.

New core complex model for the South Virgin-White Hills detachment and extension in the eastern Lake Mead area, southern Nevada and northwestern Arizona	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The eastern Lake Mead region, to the north of the belt of metamorphic core complexes that define the Colorado River extensional corridor, underwent large-magnitude extension in the middle to late Miocene. We present two speculative new models for extension in this area that resolve several puzzling and paradoxical relations. These models are based on new field mapping and structural, geochronologic, and thermochronologic data from the northern White Hills, Lost Basin Range, and south Wheeler Ridge. The Meadview fault, a previously underappreciated structure, is an east-side-down normal fault that separates the northern Lost Basin Range to the west from south Wheeler Ridge to the east. Proterozoic crystalline rocks of the northern Lost Basin Range yielded an apatite fission-track (AFT) age of 15 Ma, whereas 2 km to the east, across the Meadview fault, crystalline rocks of south Wheeler Ridge yielded a 127 Ma AFT age. Similarly, at the south end of the Lost Basin Range, crystalline rocks with ca. 15 Ma AFT ages lie within 5 km of crystalline rocks of Garnet Mountain that yielded a 68 Ma AFT age across the Grand Wash fault. Neither of these relations can be explained by existing tilted crustal section or tilt-block models. In our "classic" metamorphic core complex model, the Grand Wash fault (breakaway), the Meadview fault, and the South Virgin-White Hills detachment represent different structural levels of a single, regional detachment that was active between ca. 16 and 11 Ma. The hanging wall of the detachment consists of rocks at south Wheeler Ridge, the Paleozoic ridges, and possibly part of the crystalline basement of the Gold Butte block, sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the hanging walls of the Salt Spring and Cyclopic Mine faults, and possibly stranded tilt blocks beneath the Grand Wash Trough supradetachment basin. The footwall, exhumed by subvertical simple shear and characterized by middle Miocene AFT ages, includes the central and western Gold Butte block, Hiller Mountains, and crystalline rocks of the White Hills and the Lost Basin Range. The east-dipping Meadview fault bounds the crystalline core on the east; the west-dipping South Virgin-White Hills detachment bounds the core on the west. Therefore, the Grand Wash fault represents the structurally highest part of the detachment, and the South Virgin-White Hills detachment represents the structurally deepest exposed part of the detachment. In the modified core complex model, the Grand Wash, Meadview, and South Virgin-White Hills detachment faults are separate structures, and the Grand Wash Trough is a "trailing-edge" basin bound on the east by the Grand Wash fault and on the west by the Meadview fault. The South Virgin-White Hills detachment is the main detachment along which extension was accommodated, and the Meadview fault is a major antithetic normal fault that facilitated exhumation of the core at the trailing edge of the detachment system.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2463-8				2010	463						353	370		10.1130/2010.2463(16)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2463(16)													WOS:000286214300016
J	MORTON, WM				MORTON, WM			COMPARATIVE CATCHES AND FOOD-HABITS OF DOLLY VARDEN AND ARCTIC CHARRS, SALVELINUS-MALMA AND SALVELINUS-ALPINUS, AT KARLUK, ALASKA, IN 1939-1941	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The seriousness of the predations of dolly varden (S. malma) upon the eggs, alevins and juveniles of Pacific salmons (Oncorhynchus) is a controversial subject. In western Alaska, from 1920-1941, bounties were given on dolly varden in the belief that they were serious salmon predators. This study was made to evaluate the need and justification for a bountry system. The incidental examination of stomach contents of charrs which were captured for tagging or for tag recovery purposes from Karluk Lake and Karluk River on Kodiak Island, Alaska and from Shelikof Strait and Uyak Bay during the summer months of 1939, 1940 and 1941 presented an opportunity to pursue this project. Stomachs were collected and contents analyzed from 1992 arctic charr (S. alpinus) and 2565 dolly varden charr (S. malma), taken by beach seine, gill net, fyke net, hook and line and by weir trap from Karluk Lake; from 956 dolly varden taken by seine and weir trap from the Karluk River; and from 462 dolly varden taken by beach seine and commercial salmon traps in Uyak Bay. Among the > 5000 charr stomachs examined, only 42 contained salmon smolts, parr or alevin. Examination of 500 stomachs taken from dolly varden charr captured in the lower Karluk River at the height of the red salmon (O. nerka) smolt migration in May of 1939 revealed little evidence of predation on the smolts in fresh water. There was some evidence that this relationship changed after the migrating charr became adjusted to salt water, although the examination of 460 stomachs of dolly varden captured in salt water revealed nothing incriminating in its role as a salmon predator. The fact that the downstream migration of the dolly varden reached its peak before that of the red salmon smolts is significant. Examination of the 4500 charr stomachs at Karluk Lake from April-Sept. led to the discovery that 2 distinct species of charrs were present, 1 the dolly varden, primarily stream-inhabiting and anadromous, and the other, the arctic charr, primarily lake-inhabiting and nonanadromous. Although red salmon eggs constituted 32% of the total volume of food ingested by both species of charr at Karluk Lake, there was evidence that they were consumed in salvage or scavenger feeding, and there was practically no evidence that they were consumed as a result of predatory feeding. Only 5, or 0.1%, of the thousands of charr stomachs examined at Karluk Lake contained red salmon parr or alevin.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1982	7	1					7	28		10.1007/BF00011819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011819													WOS:A1982NB00900002

A detailed survey of Quaternary deposits in boreholes and exposed sections provided a complete record of the basin. The most complete core was analyzed for palynology and magnetic properties. Plant macrofossils were obtained by flotation. Pollen and spectrometric analysis allowed a precise stratigraphic placement of a moose antler and braincase kept in museum collections. The basin originated from fluviatile obstruction of a tributary valley cut into bedrock. The basal deposits formed as a terrestrial hydromorphic soil under a dense Tsuga-forest (zone RNC 1). The overlying palustrine gyttja shows a marked forest withdrawal with a climatic signature (zone RNC 3), followed by a re-establishment of mixed conifer forests (zones RNC 4-6). The occurrences of pollen of cold-adapted taxa (Saxifraga oppositifolia type, Saxifraga stellaris type, Larix), are the oldest so far known south of the Alps and suggest that mean summer temperature was near or even below the thermic tree limit. High herb diversity, partially represented by tall forbs, characterizes this zone. A further increase of the water table can be assumed in zones RNC 4 and RNC 5, since pollen of aquatic plants increases. The find of Larix decidua L. cones demonstrates the existence of the European larch in the Early Pleistocene of the Alps, previously not identified at the species level. After the Serio river had reached the maximum Quaternary aggradation, the lake was rapidly filled up with turbiditic sediments. The identification of Cervalces latifrons (Johnson, 1874) by Azzaroli (Palaeantogr. Italica 71(1979) 48) was confirmed. Pollen spectra obtained from clay fragments preserved in the braincase allowed us to constrain the stratigraphic position of these fossil remains in the lower palustrine portion of the sequence. Pollen and moose palaeoecology corroborate the reconstruction of a boreal landscape. The succession of Fornaci di Ranica is attributed to the late Early Pleistocene on the basis of the following elements: (i) the occurrence of an acme pollen zone of Tsuga, with Carya and Pteroearya; (ii) the low representation of Cedrus; (iii) the biochronology of Cervalces latifrons; (iv) normal fossil magnetic polarity, interpreted as part of the Jaramillo subchron on the basis of correlations with other studied sections from the same region, and, finally, (v) indications from the regional geological evolution. The basin deposits spanned the final stage of a temperate period and the subsequent transition to a cold phase during the Jaramillo subchron or the Cobb cryptochron. The basin originated by fluvioglacial aggradation, triggered by glaciation in the northern part of the Serio river catchement. The lake succession may represent an episode of marked increase of polar ice volume related to MIS (36) 30, or 28. The correlation with the Leffe sequence also suggests that cold climate conditions inferred for pollen zone RNC 3 did not occur earlier in the Early Pleistocene of this region.

J	RYE, RO; BETHKE, PM; WASSERMAN, MD				RYE, RO; BETHKE, PM; WASSERMAN, MD			THE STABLE ISOTOPE GEOCHEMISTRY OF ACID SULFATE ALTERATION	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS												Acid sulfate wall-rock alteration, characterized by the assemblage alunite + kaolinite + quartz +/- pyrite, results from base leaching by fluids concentrated in H2SO4. Requisite amounts of H2SO4 can be generated by different mechanisms in three principal geologic environments: (1) by atmospheric oxidation of sulfides in the supergene environment, (2) by atmospheric oxidation at the water table in the steam-heated environment of H2S released by deeper, boiling fluids, and (3) by the disproportionation of magmatic SO2 to H2S and H2SO4 during condensation of a magmatic vapor plume at intermediate depths in magmatic hydrothermal environments in silicic and andesitic volcanic terranes. In addition, coarse vein alunite may form in a magmatic steam environment from rapid release of an SO2-rich magmatic vapor phase at high temperature and low pressure or from the oxidation of a more reduced magmatic vapor by entrained atmospheric oxygen in the carapace of a volcanic edifice. Alunite [KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6] contains four stable isotope sites and complete analyses (delta-D, delta-(OSO4)-O-18, delta-(OOH)-O-18, and delta-S-34) are now possible. Except for delta-(OOH)-O-18 in magmatic hydrothermal alunites, primary values are usually retained. In cooperation with many colleagues, over 500 measurements have been made on nearly 200 samples of alunite and associated minerals from 23 localities, and 55 additional analyses have been taken from the literature. This survey confirms that kinetic factors play an important role in the stable isotope systematics of alunite and acid sulfate alteration. To a very large extent they form the isotopic basis for distinguishing between environments of acid sulfate alteration, and they provide important insights into attendant processes. Stable isotope analyses of alunite, often in combination with those on associated sulfides and kaolinite, permit recognition of environments of formation and provide information on origins of components, processes (including rates), physical-chemical environments, and temperatures of formation. Supergene acid sulfate alteration may form over any sulfide zone when it is raised above the water table by tectonics or exposed by erosion. it may overprint earlier acid sulfate assemblages, particularly the magmatic hydrothermal assemblages which are pyrite rich such as at El Salvador, Chile; Rodalquilar, Spain; and Goldfield, Nevada. Supergene alunite normally has delta-S-34 values virtually identical to precursor sulfides unless bacteriogenic reduction of aqueous sulfate takes place in standing pools of water. Delta-D values are close to that of local meteoric water unless extensive evaporation occurs. Delta-D and delta-(OOH)-O-18 values of supergene alunites from a range of latitudes fall in a broad zone parallel to the meteoric water line much the way delta-D and delta-O-18 values of associated halloysite-kaolinite fall near the kaolinite line of Savin and Epstein (1970). Delta-(OSO4)-O-18, values are kinetically controlled and will reflect the hydrogeochemistry of the environment. DELTA-(OSO4-OH)-O-18 values are grossly out of equilibrium and large negative values are definitive of a supergene origin. In steam-heated environments, such as those at the Tolfa district, Italy, and Marysvale, Utah, and numerous modern geothermal systems, acid sulfate alteration zones are characterized by pronounced vertical zoning. Such acid sulfate alteration may occur over adularia-sericite-type base and precious metal ore deposits such as the one at Buckskin, Nevada. Initial delta-(OSO4)-O-18 and delta-S-34 values are kinetically controlled, but delta-(OSO4)-O-18 values usually equilibrium with fluids, and even delta-S-34 values may reflect partial exchange with H2S where the residence time of aqueous sulfate is sufficient. Most alunites of steam-heated origin have delta-S-34 values the same as those of precursor H2S (and as related sulfides, if present) and delta-D values similar to that of local meteoric water. In the samples analyzed, most DELTA-(OSO4-OH)-O-18 values give reasonable temperatures of 90-degrees to 160-degrees-C, indicating that delta-(OSO4)-O-18 and delta-(OOH)-O-18 values reflect a close approach to equilibrium with the fluid. The delta-(OSO4)-O-18 and delta-(OOH)-O-18 values also reflect the degree of exchange of the meteoric fluids with wall rock. Coeval kaolinites typically have delta-O-18 and delta-D values to the left of the kaolinite line. Magmatic hydrothermal, acid sulfate alteration zones in near-surface epithermal deposits such as Summitville, Colorado. Julcani, Peru, and Red Mountain and Lake City, Colorado, are characterized by vertical orientation and horizontal zoning, the presence of coeval pyrite, PO4 analogues of alunite, zunyite, and later gold, pyrite and enargite, and often other Cu-As-Sb-S minerals. Acid sulfate alteration assemblages also occur as late stages in the porphyry-copper deposit at El Salvador, Chile. In the examples studied, magmatic hydrothermal alunites have delta-D values close to those for magmatic water. Delta-S-34 values are 16 to 28 per mil larger than those for associated pyrite, reflecting equilibrium between aqueous H2S and SO4 formed by the disproportionation of magmatically derived SO2. Delta-(OSO4)-O-18 values are usually 8 to 18 per mil and vary systematically with delta-S-34 values, reflecting variations in temperature and/or H2S/SO4 fluid ratios. Further variation in delta-(OSO4)-O-18, values may result if SO2 condenses in mixed magmatic meteoric water fluids. DELTA-(OSO4-OH)-O-18 values of magmatic hydrothermal alunites are generally unsuitable for temperature determinations because of retrograde exchange in the OH site but DELTA-S-34(alunite-pyrite) values provide reliable temperature estimates. Magmatic steam environments appear to occur over a range of depths and are characterized by monomineralic veins of coarse alunite in variably alunitized and kaolinized wall rocks containing minor pyrite. Alunite formed in the magmatic steam environment can usually be recognized by delta-S-34 near delta-S-34(SIGMA-S) values and delta-D and delta-(OSO4)-O-18, values near magmatic values. Magmatic steam alunite differs from magmatic hydrothermal alunite by having delta-S-34 close to delta-S-34(SIGMA-S) values of the system. DELTA-(OSO4-OH)-O-18 values of most magmatic steam alunite give temperatures ranging from 90-degrees to 210-degrees-C but, for reasons which are not understood, some temperatures as well as calculated delta-(OH2O)-O-18 values are too low for presumed precipitation from a magmatic vapor phase. MagmatiC steam environments may occur over porphyry-type mineralization as at Red Mountain, Colorado, and Alunite Ridge, Utah, and over or adjacent to adularia-sericite-type deposits in volcanic domes as at Cactus, California.																			0361-0128					MAR-APR	1992	87	2					225	262		10.2113/gsecongeo.87.2.225	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.87.2.225													WOS:A1992HM75100001

Solfataric alteration at the South Sulfur Bank, Kilauea, Hawaii, as a mechanism for the formation of sulfates, phyllosilicates, and silica on Mars	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Solfataric alteration at the South Sulfur Bank of the former Kilauea caldera produced opal, Mg- and Fe-rich smectites, gypsum, and jarosite through silica replacement of pyroclastic Keanakako'i ash and leaching of basaltic lavas. This site on the island of Hawaii serves as an analog for formation of several minerals found in altered deposits on Mars. Two distinct alteration environments were characterized in this study, including a light-toned, high-silica, friable outcrop adjacent to the vents and a bedded outcrop containing alternating orange/tan layers composed of smectite, gypsum, jarosite, hydrated silica, and poorly crystalline ferric oxide phases. This banded unit likely represents the deposition of pyroclastic material with variations in chemistry over time that was subsequently altered via moderate hydrothermal and pedogenic processes and leaching of basaltic caprock to enhance the Si, Al, Mg, Fe, and Ca in the altered layers. In the light-toned, friable materials closest to the vents along the base of the outcrop, glassy fragments were extensively altered to opal-A plus anatase. Lab measurements of samples returned from the field were conducted to replicate recent instruments at Mars and provide further characterization of the samples. These include elemental analyses, sample texture, XRD, SEM, VNIR/mid-IR reflectance spectroscopy, TIR emittance spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Variations in the chemistry and mineralogy of these samples are consistent with alteration through hydrothermal processes as well as brines that may have formed through rain interacting with sulfuric fumes. Silica is present in all altered samples, and the friable pyroclastic ash material with the strongest alteration contains up to 80 wt% SiO2. Sulfate mineralization occurred at the South Sulfur Bank through fumarolic action from vents and likely included solfataric alteration from sulfuric gases and steam, as well as oxidation of sulfides in the basaltic caprock. Gypsum and jarosite are typically present in different layers of the altered wall, likely because they require different cations and pH regimes. The presence of both jarosite and gypsum in some samples implies high-sulfate concentrations and the availability of both Ca2+ and Fe3+ cations in a brine percolating through the altered ash. Pedogenic conditions are more consistent with the observed Mg-smectites and gypsum in the tan layers, while jarosite and nontronite likely formed under more acidic conditions in the darker orange layers. Assemblages of smectite, Ca-sulfates, and jarosite similar to the banded orange/tan unit in our study are observed on Mars at Gale crater, Noctis Labyrinthus, and Mawrth Vallis, while high-silica outcrops have been identified in parts of Gusev crater, Gale crater, and Nili Patera on Mars.

J	Sharma, S; Shukla, AD				Sharma, Shubhra; Shukla, Anil D.			Mid-Holocene climate-glacier relationship inferred from landforms and relict lake sequence, Southern Zanskar ranges, NW Himalaya	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The geomorphological disposition of (para/peri) glacial landforms, elemental geochemistry, and optical chronology of the relict lake sediment in the Southern Zanskar ranges, northwest Himalaya are used to understand the relationship between glacial dynamics and the lake sedimentation during the mid-Holocene climate variability. Following the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM), pulsating deposition of outwash gravels until the early Holocene overwhelmed the Zanskar valley. The obstruction of Tsarap Chu (chu = river) by alluvial fans during the mid-Holocene led to the development of Padum Lake. In the present study, cirque glacier moraines representing three minor glacial advances were mapped along with sedimentological details and dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating technique. The oldest cirque glacier advance -Padum Cirque moraine-3 (PDCm-3) is dated to 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka. The succeeding advance (PDCm-2) is dated to 5.3 +/- 0.6 and 4.8 +/- 0.8 ka whereas, the younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) remains undated. The mid to late Holocene climate variability inferred using major and trace element geochemistry of the relict Padum lake sediments supported by optical chronology indicates six centennial to millennial-scale climatic phases. The prominent warmer phases are represented by decreased mineralogical fine grain flux (low K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) with a corresponding increased coarse grain flux (higher Ti/Al and Sr/Al ratios). These phases are dated between 5.9 and 5.5 ka (phase-I), 3.8 and 3.4 ka (phase-IV), and 2.8 and 2.5 ka (phase-VI). The increased mineralogical finer fraction (higher K/Ti, Fe/Si, and Al/Si) between 5.5 and 5.1 ka (phase-II) and 3.4 and 2.8 ka (phase-V) indicate reduced meltwater flux during cooler phases. The intervening phase-III (5.1-3.8 ka) is characterized by increased mineralogical coarse grain flux (decreasing K/Ti, Fe/Si, Al/Si) suggesting gradual warming. The oscillatory climate at millennial scale was further used to understand glacier dynamics. The PDCm-2 advance in the lake record corresponds to the first major cooling (5.5 and 5.1 ka; phase-II) and continued until-3.8 ka. Using geochemical data of lake record, a major recession is inferred after 3.8 ka that persisted until around 3.4 ka (phase-IV). Similarly, the undated younger cirque glacier advance (PDCm-1) is assigned to the second cooling event (3.4 and 2.8 ka; phase-V). Thereafter, the cirque glaciers receded, most likely under increasing dryness and fluctuating climate (2.8-2.5 ka, phase-VI). After-2.6 ka, the development of ice-wedge pseudomorphs indicates the onset of permafrost conditions that degraded after-2.5 ka implying an increase in air temperature. The lake sedimentation terminates with the deposition of multiple younger alluvial fan facies. The climate variability shows a close correspondence with regional climate records suggesting that marginal glacier advancements were triggered by enhanced moisture via atmospheric rivers and cooler winter temperatures. The study highlights the potential of relict lake sediment in association with para-and peri-glacial landforms to reconstruct the pattern of minor glacier responses to climate variability during the Holocene.

J	Cann, JH; Belperio, AP; Murray-Wallace, CV				Cann, JH; Belperio, AP; Murray-Wallace, CV			Late quaternary paleosealevels and paleoenvironments inferred from foraminifera, Northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Spencer Gulf is an elongate marine embayment extending northwards ca. 300 km inland into southern continental Australia to the apex at Port Augusta, with a narrow estuarine extension northwards. Since the postglacial sealevel maximum, prograding coastal sedimentation has been effective through the trapping and binding actions of seagrasses, mangroves and cyanobacterial mats, and a well-defined zonation of subtidal, intertidal and supratidal sedimentary facies is characteristic of the northern gulf. Mollusks and foraminifera are prolific, especially within seagrass meadows, and their abundant remains, entire and comminuted, form bioclastic carbonate sediments. Distinctive assemblages of foraminifera are associated with the various estuarine and marine environments. The hypersaline estuary north of Port Augusta is characterized by the textulariids Ammobaculites barwonensis and Trochammina inflata, the latter most common where mangroves are present. Two species of Triloculina, T. inflata and T. oblonga are the only common miliolids, while the rotaliids are represented by Ammonia beccarii, Elphidium articulatum and Nonion depressulus. South of Port Augusta, in euryhaline intertidal waters, Trochammina inflata, A. beccarii and E. articulatum are commonly associated. The shallow subtidal Posidonia seagrass meadows support an abundant fauna which is dominated by three species, Nubecularia lucifuga, Peneroplis planatus and Discorbis dimidiatus. These species continue into the deeper waters, ca. 20 m, where they are subordinate to Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, Massilina milletti, Elphidium crispum and E macelliforme. A vibrocore from 20 m water depth in Northern Spencer Gulf recovered 4 m of late Quaternary fossiliferous sediment. Amino acid racemization (AAR) and radiocarbon ages derived from fossil mollusks revealed four chronostratigraphic packages of sediment: 400-360 cm, penultimate interglacial, oxygen isotope stage 7; 360-240 cm, last interglacial, oxygen isotope substage 5e; 240-180 cm, interstadial, oxygen isotope stage 3; and 180 cm to the top of the core, postglacial, oxygen isotope stage 1. Species of foraminifera within the core are mostly also living in the modern gulf, thus the preserved assemblages permit plausible interpretations of paleoenvironments and paleosealevels. Large numbers of Q. lamarckiana and M. milletti in the substage 5e interval indicate that the last interglacial sealevel in southern Australia was only slightly higher than that of today. N. lucifuga is abundant in the stage 3 sediment, thus paleowaterdepth at the core site was ca. less than or equal to 2 m. This evidence further supports interstadial paleosealevels above -30 m, as previously determined for Gulf St Vincent. Basal sediments of the postglacial interval preserve a monospecific assemblage of Miliolinella labiosa which signifies an estuarine setting having many of the characteristics of a saline lake. Maximum Holocene sealevel is signified by the acme of M. milletti at 90 cm. Subsequent local hydro-isostatic relative fall of sealevel is shown by changes up-core from 90 cm in both the general foraminiferal record, for example by declining numbers of M. milletti, and also by reduced numbers of E. macelliforme compared with those of E. crispum.

Modelling wetland extent using terrain indices, Lake Taupo, NZ	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM				While the importance of large wetlands is well recognised and they are easily identified, the same cannot be said for small wetlands. Individually small wetlands may seem insignificant, but collectively they could play an important role in moderating flows and improving water quality in agricultural catchments. Ground-based surveys of small wetlands are time consuming while analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images is affected by trees. The use of terrain analysis to predict "potential" wetlands has the advantage of being systematic and avoids problems caused by trees. We explore the potential of terrain indices for identifying the extent of wetlands in the small agricultural Tutaeuaua catchment (6.6 km(2)) which drains to the north western shore of Lake Taupo, New Zealand. Three terrain indices were used to predict possible wetland locations - topographic wetness index, MRVBF and FLAG. The topographic wetness index (TWI=ln(A(s)/tan beta)) predicts that sites lower in the catchment are the wettest. The MRVBF (multi-resolution valley bottom flatness; Gallant and Dowling, 2003) index identifies valley bottoms by combining flatness (inverse of slope) with lowness (relative to a circular surrounding area) at a range of scales. FLAG (fuzzy landscape analysis GIS; Roberts et al., 1997) combines two normalised indices calculated from elevation to give locations in the local landscape that are low and have high contributing areas. A filled 10 m DEM and ArcInfo 8.1 were used for the modelling. Evaluation included visual assessments of patterns and areas of prediction, and cell by cell comparisons of predicted wetlands with ground truth data. For ground-truthing, a geo-botanical survey of wetlands in the catchment was undertaken using a mobile GIS. Over 5% of the farmed catchment area in the Tutaeuaua is wetland. There are a mix of riparian and seepage wetlands, with larger wetlands generally in the headwaters and smaller seepage wetlands in narrow steep-sided valleys. The spatial pattern of potential wetlands predicted by FLAG generally agrees with the mapped wetlands, particularly the larger valley bottom wetlands. TWI delineates the stream network well, but under-predicts the wetland widths, particularly for the larger wetlands. The areas with MRVBF values over 2.5 generally fall within the area identified as wetlands. MRVBF overestimates the area of wetlands by identifying flat areas distant from the stream network as potential wetland. The terrain index FLAG presented in this study offers a useful technique for identifying the locations and areal extent of valley bottom wetlands in agricultural landscapes. The transferability of this method for predicting wetland location and extent to catchments with different physiography remains to be tested.

(1999)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bachmann et al. (1999) postulated that wind energy initiated, and has maintained, high turbidity in hypertrophic (mean chlorophyll a = 92 mug l(-1)) Lake Apopka, Florida (mean depth = 1.6 m; area = 12 500 ha). They asserted that the turbid condition was initiated by a hurricane in late 1947 that destroyed submersed plant beds and that high turbidity has since been maintained by wind-driven resuspension of fluid sediments. In their view, there has been sufficient light for re-establishment of submersed plants over about 38% of the lake bottom, but plant growth has been precluded by the fluid character of the sediments. They concluded that the restoration program of the St. Johns River Water Management District, which includes reduction of the phosphorus (P) loading rate, will not restore water clarity or submersed vegetation. An alternative explanation for Lake Apopka's turbid state is that it was initiated, and has been maintained, by excessive P loading that led to algal blooms and elimination of submersed vegetation through light limitation. The transition to the turbid state was contemporaneous with drainage of 7300 ha of the floodplain wetland to create polders for farming, beginning in the early 1940s. Lake P budgets indicate that drainage of the farms caused a seven-fold increase in the P loading rate (0.08 g TP m(-2) yr(-1) to 0.55 g TP m(-2) yr(-1)). Paleolimnological analysis of lake sediments also indicates an increase in the P loading rate in mid-century, concomitant with the decline in submersed vegetation and the increase in phytoplankton abundance. After the increase in P loading, wind disturbance may have accelerated the transition to the turbid state; but, before the increase in P loading, wind disturbance was insufficient to elicit the turbid state, as evidenced by the stability of the clear-water state in the face of 14 hurricanes and 41 tropical storms from 1881 to 1946. Measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) indicate that light limitation has inhibited submersed plant growth except on the shallowest 5% of the lake bottom. Further, the correlation between the diffuse attentuation coefficient (K PAR) and chlorophyll a (CHLA) indicates that light limitation would be removed over about 82% of the lake bottom with a reduction in CHLA from 92 mug l(-1) to 25 mug l(-1). Recently, following a 40% reduction in the P loading rate, the mean total P (TP) concentration, mean CHLA, and total suspended solids fell by about 30% while mean Secchi depth increased by more than 20%. Submersed plant beds appeared in areas devoid of macrophytes for nearly 50 years. These improvements, during a period with no change in mean wind speeds measured at Lake Apopka, provide the strongest evidence that the turbid state has been maintained by excessive P loading and that the current restoration program, which combines P load reduction with planting and removal of planktivorous fish, will be effective.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2001	448	1-3					11	18		10.1023/A:1017541010768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017541010768													WOS:000169863400003

The sedimentary rocks are here divided into four principal lithofacies. The alluvial-fan facies includes deposits dominated by: (1) debris flows; (2) shallow braided streams; (3) deeper braided streams (with trough crossbeds); or (4) intense bioturbation or hyperconcentrated flows (tabular, unstratified muddy sandstone). The fluvial facies include deposits of: (1) shallow, ephemeral braided streams; (2) deeper, flash-flooding, braided streams (with poor sorting and crossbeds); (3) perennial braided rivers; (4) meandering rivers; (5) meandering streams (with high suspeded loads); (6) overbank areas or local flood-plain lakes; or (7) local streams and/or colluvium. The lacustrine facies includes deposits of: (1) deep perennial lakes; (2) shallow perennial lakes; (3) shallow ephemeral lakes; (4) playa dry mudflats; (5) salt-encrusted saline mudflats; or (6) vegetated mudflats. The lake margin clastic facies includes deposits of: (1) birdfoot deltas; (2) stacked Gilbert-type deltas; (3) sheet deltas; (4) wave-reworked alluvial fans; or (5) wave-sorted sand sheets. Coal deposits are present in the lake margin clastic and the lacustrine facies of Carnian age (Late Triassic) only in basins of south-central Virginia and North and South Carolina. Eolian deposits are known only from the basins in Nova Scotia and Connecticut. Evaporites (and their pseudomorphs) occur mainly in the northern basins as deposits of saline soils and less commonly of saline lakes, and some evaporite and alkaline minerals present in the Mesozoic rocks may be a result of later diagenesis. These relationships suggest climatic variations across paleolatitudes, more humid to the south where coal beds are preserved, and more arid in the north where evaporites and eolian deposits are common. Fluctuations in paleoclimate that caused lake levels to rise and fall in hydrologically closed basin are preserved as lacustrine cycles of various scales, including major shifts in the Late Triassic from a wet Carnian to an arid Norian. In contrast, fluvial deposits were mainly formed in response to the tectonic evolution of the basins, but to some extent also reflect climatic changes. The Newark Supergroup illustrates the complexity of rift-basin sedimentation and the problems that may arise from using a single modern analog for sedimentary deposition spanning millions of years. It also shows that a tremendous wealth of depositional, climatic, and tectonic information is preserved in ancient rift-basin deposits which can be recovered if the depositional processes of modern rift-basin deposits are understood.

Permafrost carbon emissions in a changing Arctic	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Arctic permafrost stores nearly 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and thawing carbon. Anthropogenic warming threatens to release an unknown quantity of this carbon to the atmosphere, influencing the climate in processes collectively known as the permafrost carbon feedback. In this Review, we discuss advances in tracking permafrost carbon dynamics, including mechanisms of abrupt thaw, instrumental observations of carbon release and model predictions of the permafrost carbon feedback. Abrupt thaw and thermokarst could emit a substantial amount of carbon to the atmosphere rapidly (days to years), mobilizing the deep legacy carbon sequestered in Yedoma. Carbon dioxide emissions are proportionally larger than other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, but expansion of anoxic conditions within thawed permafrost and soils stands to increase the proportion of future methane emissions. Increasingly frequent wildfires in the Arctic will also lead to a notable but unpredictable carbon flux. More detailed monitoring though in situ, airborne and satellite observations will provide a deeper understanding of the Arctic's future role as a carbon source or sink, and the subsequent impact on the Earth system. Large stores of carbon could be released to the atmosphere from Arctic warming, driving permafrost thaw. This Review examines the processes that impact Arctic permafrost carbon emissions, how they might change in the future and ways to monitor and predict these changes.

The Kentra to Arisaig area, which was covered by relatively thick ice (c. 900 m) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), shows a regression from a marine limit between 36.5 m OD and 40 m OD at c. 15.9 kyr cal BP (range 15.6 - 16.3 kyr cal BP) through to an early-Holocene minimum. A range of sites in the same area record a mid-Holocene maximum, indicative of mean sea level c. 6.5 m above present. The maximum is not a well-developed and short duration highstand as predicted by a number of models, but is an extended period, similar to 8.0 - 5.0 kyr cal BP, with sea level within c. 1 m of the maximum. Sites to the north, in Kintail, show no Late Devensian record because much of the area lies within the Younger Dryas ice limit. The altitude of the mid-Holocene maximum in Kintail is not well constrained, but occurred 7.9 - 8.1 kyr cal BP. Further north, sites on the Applecross peninsula record a Late Devensian fall in sea level and a Holocene maximum for mean sea level no higher than c. 3.0 In above present. In Coigach, the furthest north of the new sites and well outside the Younger Dryas Ice limit, there is no evidence recorded of Late Devensian sea levels above present. The Holocene maximum here was around c. 2.5 m above present. These observations of sea-level change, all standardised to change in mean sea level relative to present, constrain the glacio-hydro-isostatic rebound model parameters. Earth models comprising three mantle layers, with lateral viscosity and elastic parameters, give a satisfactory description of rebound. The parameters H-1 (lithosphere thickness) = 65 km, eta(um) (upper mantle viscosity) = 4 x 10(20) Pa C-14 seconds and eta(lm) (lower mantle viscosity)= 10(22) Pa C-14 seconds give the best overall agreement but discrepancies between observations and predictions remain. hn increase of 10% in ice thickness north of the Great Glen, compared to the previous optimum ice model, provides good agreement for many sites but important discrepancies remain for the northern sites and indicate inadequacies in the model of the British ice sheet. Several alternative ice models are examined but the various combinations of earth and ice-model illustrate the non-uniqueness of the solution. A combination of more extensive ice limits, especially onto the Hebridean Shelf and West Shetland Shelf, and some changes to ice thicknesses over the mainland should produce a better agreement, but the spatial coverage of observations remains a limitation to producing a unique solution. The characteristics of the Holocene highstand, age, duration and amplitude, at the different sites refutes the assumption that globally deglaciation ceased abruptly 7000 yr ago. The observations are consistent with an ice model that includes c. 3 m of melting over the last 7000 yr. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	LIN, YG; HONG, LX				LIN, YG; HONG, LX			STUDIES ON THE LIFE-CYCLE OF CTENOTAENIA-CITELLI (KIRSHENBLAT) AND MOSGOVOYIA-PECTINATA (GOEZE)	ACTA ZOOLOGICA SINICA												During the summer of 1981, 4 of 14 Citellus undulatus Pallas and 1 of 5 C. erythrogenys Brandt were found to be infected with Ctenotaenia citelli (Kirshenblat) in Yilin County, Xingjian, and the number of cestodes per squirrel varied from 1-6. Besides, post-mortem was also made on 6 wild hares, Lepus oiostolus Hodgsen, from the grasslands of Sailimu lake, and 2 of them showed the infections of Mosgovoyia pectinata (Goeze). In the meantime, the soil mites of Oribatei separated from the indigenous grass ground were fed with the gravid proglottids of both anoplocephalids respectively. Three months after infection, mature cysticercoids of both cestodes were obtained within the hemocoele of the infected mites. Two species of oribatid mites, Galumna curvum and Scheloribate sp., served as the intermediate hosts of C. citelli and M. pectinata. The morphology of both adult cestodes were carefully studied and compared with those of the same species described by Spassky (1951) from the Soviet Union. The characters of both mature cysticercoids are given below. Cysticercoid of C. citelli: Body cyst is oval in shape, measuring 0.142-0.150 mm in diameter. The outer cuticle measures 6.12 .mu. in thickness, with fine radical lines. The inner cyst wall is fibrous and dark in colour, being 10.4 .mu. in thickness. About 85-105 (83) calcareous bodies are scattered between the scolex and the cyst wall. The caudal appendage measures 25-288 (112) .mu. in length, belonging to the long-tail form. Cysticercoid of M. pectinata: Body cyst measures 0.138-0.138 mm in size, being oval or spherical in shape. The outer cuticle is smooth, lacking radical fines and measuring 5 .mu. in thickness. About 56-89 (74) calcareous bodies are distributed between the scolex and the cyst wall. The inner cyst wall is fibrous and gray in colour, measuring 9 .mu. in thickness. The caudal appendage is smaller, measuring 32-56 (46) .mu. in length, belonging to the short-tail form. The taxonomy relating to the genera, Cittotaenia, Ctenotaenia and Mosgovoyia given by Spassky (1951) is briefly discussed at the end of this paper. The authors consider that there is no need to establish a new genus Mosgovoyia to distinguish it from the genus Ctenotaenia. Spassky''s assertion that the presence or absence of accessory longitudinal excretory canals can distinguish between Ctenotaenia and Mosgovoyia is open to doubt. In general, the character of excretory system is often regarded as a distinction of species, but not of genus.																			0001-7302					JUN	1986	32	2					144	151																WOS:A1986D611000008
J	Best, MG; Christiansen, EH				Best, MG; Christiansen, EH			Origin of broken phenocrysts in ash-flow tuffs	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the textural nature of phenocrysts of feldspar and quartz in tuff Although many geologists have briefly alluded to ''broken'' phenocrysts, none have addressed their origin in any detail. Petrographic study of 117 cooling units in the middle Tertiary ash-flow province of the Great Basin, United States, provides a basis for characterization of the shapes and for interpretation of the origin of felsic phenocrysts in ash-flow tuffs. Although not proven to be wholly ineffective, breakage of phenocrysts by mutual impact in the erupting magma and pyroclastic flow is doubtful for at least four reasons. First, the statistical probability of mutual collision between phenocrysts diminishes exponentially as their proportion to vitroclasts diminishes (e.g., only 1% Probability for 10% phenocrysts); collision is less likely if pyroclasts move by laminar rather than turbulent flow. Second, the coating of glass and/or melt on the phenocrysts provides a cushion that absorbs the impact force. Third, plagioclases broken by impact in the laboratory have unusual shapes unlike those seen in Great Basin tuffs. Fourth, euhedral phenocrysts of feldspar are commonplace in many Great Basin tuffs, and in some they constitute a significant proportion of the phenocrysts, indicating that mutual impact does not modify all intratelluric crystals during explosive eruption. The two most populated categories of phenocryst shape in Great Basin tuffs probably correspond to what has been previously called ''broken'' phenocrysts. Somewhat less than half of the plagioclase and many sanidine phenocrysts are subhedral to anhedral. These are similar in shape, size, and composition to grains in polycrystalline aggregates within the same thin section. Kindred aggregates and discrete phenocrysts could have been derived from holocrystalline to partly crystalline material in the magma chamber that was disaggregated to varying extents during explosive eruption. More than half of the plagioclase and all of the quartz phenocrysts in Great Basin tuffs consist of irregularly shaped fragments with cuspate, embayed outlines, resembling pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, which we call phenoclasts. Inclusions of glass are common and are especially evident in larger, more or less whole crystals. Textural features of some phenocrysts in cognate pumice clasts in the tuffs reveal that they broke apart while still in the vesiculating but unfragmented magma. As the erupting magma decompressed, vesiculation of the melt that was entrapped at higher pressures as inclusions within the phenocrysts blew them apart, forming the phenoclasts. Shapes of felsic phenocrysts in volcanic rocks provide insight into their mode of emplacement. Euhedral phenocrysts are common in ash-flow tuffs as well as lava flows. Phenoclasts, however, are diagnos-tic of ash-flow tuffs, because they do not occur in Plinian ash-fall deposits and are rare in lava flows. These textural contrasts are useful for interpretation of generally older, but in any case altered and recrystallized, volcanic rocks. In such rocks, critical groundmass features and field relations that could provide clues to their origin have been obscured, but the shapes of relict phenocrysts are commonly well preserved.

Establishment of Microbial Eukaryotic Enrichment Cultures from a Chemically Stratified Antarctic Lake and Assessment of Carbon Fixation Potential	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Lake Bonney is one of numerous permanently ice-covered lakes located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The perennial ice cover maintains a chemically stratified water column and unlike other inland bodies of water, largely prevents external input of carbon and nutrients from streams. Biota are exposed to numerous environmental stresses, including year-round severe nutrient deficiency, low temperatures, extreme shade, hypersalinity, and 24-hour darkness during the winter (1). These extreme environmental conditions limit the biota in Lake Bonney almost exclusively to microorganisms (2). Single-celled microbial eukaryotes (called "protists") are important players in global biogeochemical cycling (3) and play important ecological roles in the cycling of carbon in the dry valley lakes, occupying both primary and tertiary roles in the aquatic food web. In the dry valley aquatic food web, protists that fix inorganic carbon (autotrophy) are the major producers of organic carbon for organotrophic organisms (4,) (2). Phagotrophic or heterotrophic protists capable of ingesting bacteria and smaller protists act as the top predators in the food web (5). Last, an unknown proportion of the protist population is capable of combined mixotrophic metabolism (6,) (7). Mixotrophy in protists involves the ability to combine photosynthetic capability with phagotrophic ingestion of prey microorganisms. This form of mixotrophy differs from mixotrophic metabolism in bacterial species, which generally involves uptake dissolved carbon molecules. There are currently very few protist isolates from permanently ice-capped polar lakes, and studies of protist diversity and ecology in this extreme environment have been limited (8,) (4,) (9,) (10,) (5). A better understanding of protist metabolic versatility in the simple dry valley lake food web will aid in the development of models for the role of protists in the global carbon cycle. We employed an enrichment culture approach to isolate potentially phototrophic and mixotrophic protists from Lake Bonney. Sampling depths in the water column were chosen based on the location of primary production maxima and protist phylogenetic diversity (4, 11), as well as variability in major abiotic factors affecting protist trophic modes: shallow sampling depths are limited for major nutrients, while deeper sampling depths are limited by light availability. In addition, lake water samples were supplemented with multiple types of growth media to promote the growth of a variety of phototrophic organisms. RubisCO catalyzes the rate limiting step in the Calvin Benson Bassham (CBB) cycle, the major pathway by which autotrophic organisms fix inorganic carbon and provide organic carbon for higher trophic levels in aquatic and terrestrial food webs (12). In this study, we applied a radioisotope assay modified for filtered samples (13) to monitor maximum carboxylase activity as a proxy for carbon fixation potential and metabolic versatility in the Lake Bonney enrichment cultures.

The phenotypic plasticity of extant and fossil melanopsids has been widely documented. Yet millennial-resolution, well-dated records from small aquatic habitats harboring endemics are scarce. The thermal spring-fed Lake Petea is an ice age refugia harboring a unique endemic warm-water fauna. Subfossil melanopsids display incredible morphological variability from smooth to keeled, elongated to ribbed, shouldered forms. Numerous morphotypes have been considered as individual taxa with a fluent succession from the smooth elongated to the ribbed, shouldered types. This study presents an extensive morphometric analysis of subfossil melanopsids (ca. 3500 specimens) derived from stratified samples with an independent chronology. The aim was to separate morphotypes for investigations of temporal morphological disparity. Our results challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that proposes the evolution of shouldered, compressed, ribbed shells through a two-step process from smooth elongated spindle-shaped shells. Instead, it suggests that the subfossil shells belong to two distinct taxa present throughout the available stratigraphic data. The main components of shape variation, shape globularity, and shell coiling seem allometry-related. Ribs, striation, and keels appear randomly. High-spired spindle-shaped forms were considered to represent specimens of Microcolpia daudebartii hazayi. Bulkier low-spired and shouldered specimens represent phenotypes of Mi. parreyssii parreyssii. The collective and random distribution of morphotypes from the early stages of the lake's history also refutes the idea of a continuous transformation of the elongated forms into compressed, shouldered ones. Rather points to multiple events and environmental stimuli triggering development. Melanopsids appear in Late Glacial horizons, with Theodoxus prevostianus preferring temperatures above 23 degrees C which may indicate the subordinate presence of hot water microhabitats in cooler waters. The morphological variance of endemic Lake Petea Microcolpia gastropod shells is assessed via outline analytical (EFA-elliptic Fourier analysis) and traditional distance and angle-based morphometric methods. The widely accepted hypothesis that proposes the evolution of shouldered, compressed, ribbed shells through a two-step process from smooth elongated spindle-shaped shells is challenged. Instead, our results suggest that the subfossil shells belong to two distinct taxa present throughout the available stratigraphic data. The two major taxa identified as Microcolpia daudebartii hazayi and Mi. parreyssii parreyssii are ecophenotipic varieties of the outgroup Mi. daudebartii acicularis. image																			0362-2525	1097-4687				JUN	2024	285	6							e21739	10.1002/jmor.21739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.21739								38794996					WOS:001230628400001
J	De Risi, A; Passaro, G				De Risi, Antonello; Passaro, Giovanni			Naples Underground	GALLERIE E GRANDI OPERE SOTTERRANEE												The geological heterogeneity of Naples and of its adjacent areas is probably without equal in the world. Surrounded by volcanoes, volcanic lakes, volcanic islands, fault lines and karst phenomena, its territory was shaped and modelled in a unique way difficult to find elsewhere. The energy unleashed by the activity of Vesuvius, and Phlegraean Fields, gave rise to lush and luxuriant plant life that feeds on the earth's natural fertilizers - a large variety of mineral springs disseminated throughout the Bay of Naples, the underwater remains of volcanic cones, and the socalled "secche" - shoals once teeming with coral. Clearly, human life was strongly conditioned by these geomorphological situations, by such earth movements as bradyseism. And what we see now, starting from the genesis and features of Neapolitan soil, is the result of human activities and manmade alterations, gradually developing over the course of the last three thousand years. Since antiquity, Neapolitan subsoil has seen the opening of myriad cisterns, quarries, passageways, catacombs, and more, becoming genuine road axes designed and built to traverse parts of the territory. Naples's underground settings thus present so vast and diversified a horizon that it is assessed as reaching a volume equalling about one million square metres of area; but according to some estimates, there is far more to be discovered: beneath our feet there might be two million more square metres yet to be surveyed; therefore, approximately 60% of Neapolitans live and work above a cavity. Without going into detail on the countless quarries, cavities, cisterns, and catacombs - at least those verified in terms of location and age of construction - discussion here will regard only those road tunnels built in the Augustan Age, some of which were likely to have been part of a unique military/transport project designed and conceived by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa; their chief maker was the Augustan Age Roman architect and engineer Lucius Cocceius Auctus. But first, the ancient methods of tunnelling, probably the same used in the Roman Age and handed down until just a few short decades ago - that is, until the rise of modern machinery - merit discussion. One cannot stress enough the local workers' considerable expertise - well-known since ancient times. It was no accident that to Strabo, these workers appeared to be descendents of the Cimmerians, who were said to have inhabited the area centuries earlier, dwelling in underground tunnels. This expertise was handed down over the years, making the quarrymen and excavators famous in our own time. In the following description, some terminology used in the excavators' vernacular will also be discussed.																			0393-1641					DEC	2015		116					65	71																WOS:000438383900009
J	Barthelmes, D; Brämick, U				Barthelmes, D; Brämick, U			Variability of a cyprinid lake ecosystem with special emphasis on the native fish fauna under intensive fisheries management including common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix)	LIMNOLOGICA												The lake investigated (Lake Heiliger See near the town of Angermunde, North-East Germany) is small (10.2 ha) but deep (z(max) = 12 m, z = 6.5 m). During summer the thermocline is at a depth of 4-5 m, and the hypolimnion is filled with H2S already by mid-June, making 60-75% of the bottom area inaccessible to fish. The native fish fauna is dominated by planktivorous roach (Rutilus rutilus). A test stocking of silver carp (Hypophthahnichthys molitrix) together with an unplanned and erroneous stocking of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), coupled with an incorrectly calculated strong stocking of eel (Anguilla anguilla), which assumed that the total lake area yielded fish food organisms, brought about a strong depression of the food biomass available to native fish. Both silver carp and common carp showed a pattern of behaviour which only partly agreed with results obtained in experimental ponds prior to lake stocking. At least for 10 years there was a very low zooplankton biomass (mostly below I mg/l fresh weight) caused by silver carp and a strongly reduced benthos biomass (frequently below 1 g/m(2) fresh weight) caused by common carp and eel on H,S-free bottom areas. Despite this extreme situation, which lasted for 20 years and is rarely found in lakes elsewhere, it was not possible to demonstrate negative effects on the native fish fauna comprising 16 species. Also the dominance pattern seems uninfluenced in the long run. A strong decline of the catchable roach stock was observed for some years, but the stock reappeared soon in comparable quantity. During the time of roach stock depression the individual growth of roach (and common carp) was particularly low. Nevertheless, roach succeeded in reproduction during this time in spite of the reduced zooplankton and detritus concentrations. Fry numbers per year ranged from 500-15 000 individuals/ha. The pike perch (Stizostedion lucioperca) was perhaps the most endangered species of all those living at small population numbers in the lake, since its fry is confined to the limnion where competition from silver carp and adult roach and perhaps predation by roach is highest. However the pike perch stock remained unchanged at the low level of 1950, the time prior of carp and eel stocking. All other rare species of Lake Heiliger See spawn in the littoral zone where fry survival conditions were less impacted. In summary, we present more evidence that the fish fauna of cyprinid lakes is more robust than in salmonid lakes. The regulation capacity of fish communities of eutrophic lakes seems to be able to offset even severe direct and indirect influences of fisheries management.

The hydrological regime of the East Basin of Thessaly, Greece	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies				A typical example of an area with a serious water shortage due to poor water resources management and increased demand for water is the East Basin of Thessaly. This basin constitutes part of the Pinios River basin and covers approximately 3860 km(2). The current situation relative to water resources in the East basin is thoroughly analyzed and evaluated. The average annual rainfall is approximately 530 mm and ranges from 353734 mm per year. 87% of the rainfall is lost through evapotranspiration. 45 x 10(6) m(3) Of surface water from the Pinios River serve irrigation purposes. Several types of aquifer systems are formed within the alluvial deposits of the East Basin, with hydraulic conductivity (K), transmisivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) values ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-3) m/s 0.1 to 3 x 10(-3) m(2)/s and 0.005 to 0.13, respectively [7]. Three large springs emerge from the karstified carbonate rocks of the area. In the basin, nearly 100% (or 30 x 10(6) M) of the drinking water requirements and 76% of the irrigation water requirements (145 x 10(6) m(3)) are met from groundwater. The irrigation of the 75,000 ha used for agriculture in the basin requires 335 x 10(6) m(3) of water. The aquifer systems are in many cases overexploited. A continuous decline of the water level (as much as 2m/year) has occurred in the last two decades as a result of human activities. Despite the fact that official data on groundwater contamination are scarce and sketchy, aquifer pollution by human activities may be serious in some areas. In parts of some aquifers there are areas in which NO3 exceeds the 50 mg/L limit for drinking water. Seawater intrusion occurs in the coastal areas. Valuable wetlands have been destroyed (e.g., Lake Karla) by incorrect water resources development and management. The human activities adversely affected the long term established interaction between groundwater and surface water in some reaches of the Pinios River. The Water Authorities pay little attention to water resources. The existing databases and the monitoring network are insufficient. In order to properly manage water resources in the East Basin of Thessaly, effective legal, scientific and administrative control of water resources is required in combination with conjunctive water use, through the construction of sufficient water works (e.g., small dams and/or artificial recharge projects).

Lower Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Yerington region, Nevada, and their regional context	OPHIOLITES, ARCS, AND BATHOLITHS: A TRIBUTE TO CLIFF HOPSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers				Symposium on Ophiolites, Batholiths and Regional Geology in Honor of Cliff Hopson	OCT, 2005	Salt Lake City, UT	Geol Soc Amer				Metamorphosed Triassic and Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks have been mapped, described, and measured in the Singatse, Buckskin, and northern Wassuk Ranges near Yerington, west-central Nevada. Herein, we establish new formation names for these rocks and correlate them regionally with other Triassic-Jurassic rocks, in part by use of fossil and radiometric ages. From oldest to youngest, rocks in the Singatse Range consist of a Middle Triassic or older volcanic sequence (McConnell Canyon volcanics), an Upper Triassic sequence of interbedded fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks, carbonate rocks, tuffaceous sedimentary rocks, and tuffs (Malachite Mine Formation and tuff of Western Nevada Mine), a thick Upper Triassic limestone (Mason Valley Limestone), an uppermost Triassic and Lower Jurassic siltstone sequence (Gardnerville Formation), an Early and/or Middle Jurassic limestone-gypsum-quartzite sequence (Ludwig Mine Formation), and Middle Jurassic volcanic rocks. The sequence is exposed in septa between two Middle Jurassic batholiths and was folded and metamorphosed during emplacement of the batholiths. The Middle Jurassic volcanic rocks are best exposed in the Buckskin Range to the west, where they consist of a lower-andesitic sequence (Artesia Lake volcanics) and an upper sequence of more felsic, porphyritic rocks (Fulstone Spring volcanics). The Triassic and Early Jurassic rocks are also exposed in the Wassuk Range to the east and include a thick section of andesitic and silicic volcanics, which may be in part equivalent to the McConnell Canyon volcanics, the lower part of which is intruded by the possibly cogenetic Middle Triassic Wassuk diorite and associated quartz monzonite and quartz porphyry. The McConnell Canyon volcanics apparently formed as part of an Early to early Late Triassic continental-margin volcanic arc that extended from the Mojave Desert area to northern California and Nevada. Volcanism waned in Late Triassic time, and the volcanic rocks were covered by interbedded volcaniclastic, clastic sedimentary, and carbonate rocks that include the Malachite Mine Formation and tuff of Western Nevada Mine. Late Triassic carbonate sequences, such as the Mason Valley Limestone, succeed the interbedded rocks, but this appears to have taken place earlier to the north, whereas volcanism persisted for a longer time to the south. Fine-grained siliciclastic sediments, with minor carbonate and local volcanic-derived strata, were deposited above the moremassive carbonates in a wide area during latest Triassic and Early Jurassic deposition of the Gardnerville Formation and correlative rocks. The Ludwig Mine Formation is part of a sequence of quartz-rich sandstone, evaporates, and carbonates that is widespread in western Nevada and lies on top of and ties together diverse older rock sequences of quite different character. In addition to the arc volcanic, carbonate, and clastic sequence of Yerington and surrounding regions, these older rock sequences include thick, lithologically different, basinal turbidite-mudstone sequences of similar Late Triassic to Early Jurassic age to the north, strata of the shelf terrane to the northeast and east, and probably also rocks of the North American continental platform and parts of the Sierra Nevada. The Artesia Lake and Fulstone volcanics comprise a Middle Jurassic volcanic center related to the Yerington batholith and to nearby igneous centers that is part of a volcanic arc that extended from north of the Yerington district southward through the Mojave Desert and Arizona.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2438-6				2008	438						251	288		10.1130/2008.2438(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2008.2438(09)													WOS:000272078700009

EQUILIBRIUM-NONEQUILIBRIUM STATE OF NATURAL WATERS IN THE AREA OF TOREY LAKES (EASTERN TRANSBAIKALIA) WITH LEADING MINERALS OF HOST ROCKS	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the work is related to the issues of the groundwater's chemical composition formation in environmental conditions. the solution of which, within the framework of the considered hypothesis of the interaction of water with rocks, is impossible without understanding the stage of waters equilibrium with minerals of host rocks. This problem is particularly specific due to the wide distribution of fissured volcanogenic structures and salt lakes in the territory. as well as the dry climate. At the same time, existing hypotheses single out evaporation processes as the key factor leading to water salinization, ignoring all others. Meanwhile. this is not obvious for groundwater. The general theory of interaction in the water-rock system can reveal the mechanism of water's different composition formation. distinguish different stages of salt accumulation, including the soda stage. which cannot be explained only by evaporation processes. To do this. it is necessary to calculate the degree of water saturation relative to the minerals of the host rocks. The aim of the research is to assess the equilibrium-nonequilibrium state of the natural waters in the territory with minerals of host rocks at different stages of evolutionary development, to determine the possible set of secondary minerals at each stage and to identify necessary hydrogeochemical parameters for their formation. In the future, the results will be used to study the mechanisms of groundwater formation. Objects. During chemical composition formation. groundwater goes through several stages of its development. among them: atmospheric (atmospheric waters as a source of nutrition), lithogenic (when interacting with host rocks) and evaporative (when interacting with lake waters that undergo evaporation). In order to trace the entire evolution of the composition. in addition to the directly groundwater of the upper dynamic zone (springs. wells and boreholes up to 70 m deep. 69 samples in total). atmospheric (6 samples). river (9 samples) and lake (10 samples) waters were also studied. Methods. Water's macrocomponent composition was determined by modem standard methods: titrimetric, potentiometric, photometric. atomic absorption spectrometry with flame atomization and flame atomic emission spectrometry at the INREC SB RAS (Chita), microcomponent - by the ICP-MS method at TPU (Tomsk). Petrographic and mineralogical studies of host rocks were carried out using scanning electron microscopy at TSU (Tomsk). Physico-chemical modeling of equilibria in the water-rock system was calculated using the HydroGeo software package. Then the calculation results were compared with natural observations. Results. Thermodynamic calculations in the water-rock system showed that all natural waters of the Torey Lakes area from atmospheric precipitation to salt lakes are nonequilibrium with respect to primary aluminosilicates (especially basalts, which are found in the north of the study area). which they continuously dissolve throughout this interaction. and are in equilibrium with respect to secondary minerals they form (gibbsite. kaolinite. montmorillonites. various carbonates. chlorites. albite. microcline. muscovite, etc.). The paper introduces the main physicochemical parameters (chemical composition. pH and salinity of water) obtained by the authors in the calculations. which control the formation of a certain secondary mineral.

Radiocarbon dates from three core sites constrain the timing of late Quaternary paleoenvironmental changes in the Central Andes and highlight the site-specific factors that limit the radiocarbon geochronometer. With the exception of mid-Holocene sediments, all cores are generally devoid of macrophyte fragments, thus bulk organic fractions are used to build core chronologies. Comparisons of radiocarbon results for chemically defined fractions (bulk decalcified, humate, humin) suggest that ages derived from all fractions are generally coherent in the post-13,500 yr BP time interval. In the pre-13,500 yr BP time interval, ages derived from humate extracts are significantly younger (300-7000 years) than ages from paired humin residues. Gross age incoherencies between paired humate and humin sub-fractions in pre-13,500 yr BP sediments from all core sites probably reflect the net downward migration of humates. Ages derived from bulk decalcified fractions at our shallow water (90 m) and deep water (230 m) core sites consistently fall between ages derived from humate and humin sub-fractions in the pre-13,500 yr BP interval, reflecting that the bulk decalcified fraction is predominantly a mixture of humate and humin sub-fractions. Bulk decalcified ages from the pre-13,500 yr BP interval at our intermediate depth core site (150 m) are consistently older than humate (youngest) and humin sub-fractions. This uniform, reproducible pattern can be explained by the mobilization of a relatively older organic sub-fraction during and after the re-acidification step following the alkaline treatment of the bulk sediment. The inferred existence of this 'alkali-mobile, acid-soluble' sub-fraction implies a different depositional/post-depositional history that is potentially associated with a difference in source material. While internally consistent geochronologies can be developed for the Lake Titicaca sequence using different organic fractions, mobile organic sub-fractions and fractions containing mobile sub-fractions should generally be avoided in geochronology studies. Consequently, we believe humin and/or bulk decalcified ages provide the most consistent chronologies for the post-13,500 yr BP interval, and humin ages provide the most representative ages for sedimentation prior to 13,500 yr BP interval. Using the age model derived from the deep water core site and a previously published isotope-based lake-level reconstruction, we present a qualitative record of lake level in the context of several ice-core records from the western hemisphere. We find the latest Pleistocene lake-level response to changing insolation began during or just prior to the Bolling/Allerod period. Using the isotope-based lake-level reconstruction, we also find the 85-m drop in lake level that occurred during the mid-Holocene was synchronous with an increase in the variability of ice-core delta(18)O from a nearby icecap, but was not reflected in any of the polar ice-core records recovered from the interior of Antarctica and Greenland.

J	Häder, DP; Kumar, HD; Smith, RC; Worrest, RC				Häder, DP; Kumar, HD; Smith, RC; Worrest, RC			Effects on aquatic ecosystems	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												Regarding the effects of W-B radiation on aquatic ecosystems, recent scientific and public interest has focused on marine primary producers and on the aquatic web, which has resulted in a multitude of studies indicating mostly detrimental effects of UV-B radiation on aquatic organisms. The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column. Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, W-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68 degrees N, 19 degrees E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27 degrees N, 17 degrees W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring. Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic Link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to W-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and W-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms. On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related W-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web. Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar W-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated. UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UVB-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply. Amphibian populations are in serious decline in many areas of the world, and scientists are seeking explanations for this phenomenon. Most amphibian population declines are probably due to habitat destruction or habitat alteration. Some declines are probably the result of natural population fluctuations. Other explanations for the population declines and reductions in range include disease, pollution, atmospheric changes and introduced competitors and predators. W-B radiation is one agent that may act in conjunction with other stresses to affect amphibian populations adversely. The succession of algal communities is controlled by a complex array of external conditions, stress factors and interspecies influences. Freshwater ecosystems have a high turnover and the success of an individual species is difficult to predict, but the development of general patterns of community structure follows defined routes. There is a strong predictive relationship between DOC concentration and the depth to which UV radiation penetrates in lakes. Since DOC varies widely, freshwater systems display a wide range of sensitivity to UV penetration. In these systems, increased solar UV-B radiation is an additional stress factor that may change species composition and biomass productivity. The Arctic aquatic ecosystem is one of the most productive ecosystems on earth and is a source of fish and crustaceans for human consumption. Both endemic and migratory species breed and reproduce in this ocean in spring and early summer, at a time when recorded increases in W-B radiation are maximal. Productivity in the Arctic ocean has been reported to be higher and more heterogeneous than in the Antarctic ocean. In the Bering Sea, the sea-edge communities contribute about 40-50% of the total productivity. Because of the shallow water and the prominent stratification of the water layer, the phytoplankton are more exposed and affected by solar W-B radiation. In addition, many economically important fish (e.g., herring, pollock, cod and salmon) spawn in shallow waters where they are exposed to increased solar UV-B radiation. Many of the eggs and early larval stages are found at or near the surface. Consequently, reduced productivity of fish and other marine crops is possible but has not been demonstrated. There is increased consensus, covering a wide range of aquatic ecosystems, that environmental W-B, independent of ozone-related increases, is an important ecological stress that influences the growth, survival and distribution of phytoplankton. Polar ecosystems, where ozone-related UV-B increases are the greatest and which are globally significant ecosystems, are of particular concern. However, these ecosystems are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability, which makes it difficult to separate out UV-B-specific effects on single species or whole phytoplankton communities. There is clear evidence for short-term effects. In one study a 4-23% photoinhibition of photosystem II activity was measured under the ozone hole. However, extrapolation of short-term effects to long-term ecological consequences requires various complex effects to be accounted for and quantitative evaluation remains uncertain. (C) 1998 UNEP.

Attracting Lake Sturgeon back to a historical spawning location following a 20-year hiatus using effluent from tanks holding gravid broodstock	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Spawning habitat enhancement for sturgeon species has often resulted in limited long-term success, raising questions about the process of spawning site selection. Acknowledging that Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens have well-developed chemoreceptors and the general potential for learned behavior in fish, we investigated whether Lake Sturgeon spawning could be reinduced at a habitat not contemporarily utilized by the species.Methods The study was conducted where the Landing River empties into the Nelson River main stem in northern Manitoba, Canada. Effluent from streamside holding tanks containing gravid broodstock, presumably rich in hormones or pheromones, was discharged by hose into the Landing River during spring from 2019 to 2024. The attraction of Lake Sturgeon into the Landing River was then monitored using visual methods.Results After a nearly 20-year absence, Lake Sturgeon were successfully attracted back into the Landing River and spawning behavior was observed. A maximum concurrent count of 30 Lake Sturgeon was observed via aerial drone in 2024. The first individuals observed in the Landing River each year often closely followed the timeline of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone injections into the broodstock and/or egg releases in the tanks, suggesting an acute attraction response related to hormones or pheromones associated with spawning that were contained in the effluent released into the Landing River. In three different observation years, the draw of the effluent appeared to be eventually superseded by the draw of other fish and/or spawning activity within the river.Conclusions Lake Sturgeon spawning site selection appears to be strongly influenced by the presence of conspecifics. In the future, it may be possible to produce synthetic Lake Sturgeon hormones or pheromones and release them into the water to guide Lake Sturgeon into habitats that are conducive to successful egg hatch and subsequent recruitment. Spawning habitat enhancement for sturgeon species has often resulted in limited long-term success, raising questions about the process of spawning site selection. Using effluent from streamside holding tanks containing gravid broodstock, we successfully attracted Lake Sturgeon back into the Landing River, Manitoba. Spawning behavior was observed after a nearly 20-year absence. Fisheries managers should be aware that the presence of other sturgeon may be an important determinant in attracting sturgeon to spawning habitat.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2025	45	4					734	741		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf038		JUN 2025											WOS:001501573800001

In addition, abundant gypsum deposits from the Mesozoic era and many salt springs developed in the basin. However, the weak research level on both aspects has led to much controversy regarding the evolution relationship between material sources and the migration process of ancient salt fluids in the region. In this paper, the main research area is the Qamdo basin. Through the study of sedimentology, lithology, and mineralogy of three Mesozoic long-section stratigraphic profiles within the basin, combined with the geochemical characteristics of silicate facies elements, the provenance characteristics, the evolution of the depositional environment and paleofluid migration process is discussed in the study area. And attempt to reveal the provenance relationship between the Qamdo area and the Lanping-Simao-Khorat salt-forming belt. The results showed that Mesozoic sedimentary strata in the Qamdo basin encompass the tectonic background information passive continental margin, active continental margin, and continental island arc, which shows a long-term mixed provenance of materials sources in the study area. The parent rock property characteristics of the Late Mesozoic strata in the Qamdo basin are predominantly by quartz-feldspathic acidic rock series, and they exhibit a high degree of similarity to the provenance attributes of the corresponding strata in the Lanping-Simao basin. The Qamdo basin has seen its sedimentary environment gradually evolve from a paralic transitional facies phase in the Middle Jurassic to an inland river-lake facies sedimentary environment during the Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous periods. Combining the grain size characteristics of sandstone and the analysis of cumulative probability distribution curves, since the Middle Jurassic, the shallow lake to semi-deep lake facies environment has gradually evolved from a shore shallow lake facies environment to a river-lake delta facies environment in the basin. Through the discussion of the provenance evolution relationship between the Qamdo basin and the Lanping-Simao-Khorat salt-forming belt, we believe the Late Mesozoic terrestrial ancient lakes region enclosed a large-scale metamorphosed seawater in the Qamdo basin. It provided the material basis for forming the giant "anomalous" evaporite salts in the Lanping-Simao-Khorat salt-forming belt.

J	Muzuka, ANN				Muzuka, ANN			Isotopic compositions of tropical East African flora and their potential as source indicators of organic matter in coastal marine sediments	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The C and N stable isotope compositions of some flora of East Africa from coastal Tanzania and Amboseli National Park (Kenya) are used to assess if they can be used as a terrestrial end member during the estimation of terrestrial fraction in coastal marine sediments. The results of C isotope composition of various tree leaves, which average -29.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand, indicate that these tropical higher land plant species follow a Calvin-Benson or non-Kranz (C-3) type of metabolism. The results for grass species, which average -13.2 +/- 2.4 parts per thousand, indicate that most of them follow a Hatch-Slack or Kranz (C-4) type of metabolism. However, some of the succulent plants from the Amboseli National Park have delta(13)C values that average -14.7 parts per thousand, an indication that they follow a CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) type of metabolism. The N isotope values are relatively higher than expected for the terrestrial organic material. The average delta(15)N values for both tree and grass samples are higher than 5 parts per thousand and fall within the range normally considered to be marine. The high enrichment in N-15 may be related to the environmental conditions in which plants thrive. Plants growing in sandy, dry and overgrazed environments are expected to be enriched in N-15 owing to full utilisation of all available N species, regardless of their isotopic compositions. Other processes which may cause an enrichment in N-15 include adsorption by various types of clay minerals, supply of N-15-enriched nitrate through sea-spray, and local denitrification, especially in swampy and lake margins where the input of organic matter may be higher than the rate of decomposition. The stable isotopic compostion of organic C and N for surficial organic matter for the coastal marine sediments averages -17.0 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand and 5.4 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively. These values indicate a substantial contribution of C, plants and sea grasses. However, contribution of C, relative to that of sea grasses can not be evaluated owing to the fact that there is no significant difference in the isotopic compositions between the two groups. In the savannah environment, where a contribution from the C, types of plants might be substantial, the delta(13)C value for a terrestrial end member needs to be established prior to evaluation of the terrestrially derived organic matter in the marine environment. Owing to a significant contribution of sea grasses to the total organic matter preserved in coastal marine sediments, the stable isotopes of organic C seem to have a limited applicability as source indicators in the East African coastal waters. Furthermore, the results indicate that N stable isotopes seem to have a limited applicability as source indicators in coastal waters of East Africa. However, more work needs to be conducted to determine the terrestrial and sea grass end member values for the coastal areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Limited.

J	Qiao, M; Huang, S; Wang, Z				Qiao, Min; Huang, Shengbiao; Wang, Zijian			Partitioning characteristics of PAHs between sediment and water in a shallow lake	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Goal, Scope and Background. Distribution of hydrophobic organic contaminants in abiotic compartments is essential for describing their transfer and fate in aquatic ecosystems. Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Water quality of Taihu Lake has deteriorated greatly during the last decades and has threatened the water supply. The aim of the present study was to investigate the partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among overlying water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), sediments, and pore water in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake and to provide useful information for the ecological engineering in this area. Materials and Methods. Overlying water and surface sediment were sampled from six sites in Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, China, Within 72 h of sampling, sediments were centrifuged to obtain the pore water. Overlying water samples were filtered to separate dissolved and SPM samples. After extraction, samples were purified following a clean-up procedure. PAH fraction was obtained by elution with a mixture of hexane: DCM (7:3, V/V) and analyzed by GC/MS. Results. PAHs concentrations in overlying water varied from 37.5 ng/L to 183.5 ng/L. Concentrations of PAHs in pore water were higher than those in overlying water. The total concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in sediments ranged from 2091.8 ng/ g-dw to 4094.4 ng/g-dw. PAHs concentrations on SPM were decreased with suspended solid concentrations (SSC). Total PAHs concentrations on SPM varied in the range of 3369.6 ng/g-dw to 7531.1 ng/g-dw. The partition coefficients between sediment and overlying water (log K-oc) for PAHs with log K-ow < 5 were positively correlated with their octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-ow) (n=39, r=0.79, p < 0.0001). Partition coefficients between sediment and pore water (log K-oc') for all PAHs were also significantly correlated with their log K-ow values (n=48, r=0.82, p < 0.0001). Discussion. In general, PAHs derived from combustion sources tend to bind strongly to soot particles in natural sediment. Consequentially, K., values observed in the natural environment could be orders of magnitude higher than those predicted by linear correlation relationships under laboratory conditions. In the present study, the ratio of log K-oc values to log K-ow values falls consistently above 1, indicating that the sediment soot carbon in the bay was more attractive for PAHs than n-octanol. The log K-oc' was also higher than that predicted under laboratory conditions, suggesting that the measured pore water PAH concentrations were lower than those predicted. That is to say, not all the sediment PAHs can be available to partition rapidly into sediment pore waters. A variation in soot content is a possible reason. Furthermore, concentrations of PAHs on SPM were higher than those in sediments. The compositions of PAHs on SPM and in sediments were similar, indicating the importance of re-suspension process of sediments in the partitioning process of the shallow lake. Conclusions. The results indicated the equilibrium partitioning model could be used to predict PAHs distribution in various phases of a shallow lake in the stagnation period, but re-suspension processes should be considered to modify the relationship between log K(oc)s and log K(ow)s. Recommendations and Perspectives. Concentration, particle size and composition of resuspended particles could affect the relationship between log K(oc)s and log K(ow)s. Further work should be done under field conditions, especially where a steady thermodynamic equilibrium state could be assumed.

There are numerous geothermal energy plants (for example Kizildere, Nazilli, Hidirbeyli, Balcova, Tuzla) in Aegean region, Western Turkey. Simav geothermal field is located within the Aegean Graben System in Western Anatolia. Rock units in the study area are mainly the formation of Menderes Massive. The Simav geothermal waters were divided into four types: (1) Eynal, (2) Citgol, (3) geothermal water and (4) cold water. In this study, we aimed to introduce a method for classifying waters in the study area using some parameters such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and major ions by means of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. The data at hand obtained from wells indicate that the drilled water can be used for drinking and irrigation, the data also reveals that the ground water flows towards the desiccated lake. The cold water analysis gave high CO3+HCO3, Ca, Mg ion values, and low NH4, NO3, Fe, NO2, Al and Mn ion values. On the other hand, the hot water analysis indicate that a cation trend of Na+K>Ca>Mg and an anion trend of HCO3+CO3>SO4>Cl. While preparing the training data set in ANN method, for input, T (degrees C), EC (mu S), pH, Na (mg/l), K (mg/l), Ca (mg/l), Mg (mg/l), CO3 (mg/l), HCO3 (mg/l), Cl (mg/l) and SO4 (mg/l) values of 50 water samples from the study area were used. Four output values were used. In each output value, the known water was represented by 1 and others by 0. A test data set of 15 samples in which the T, EC, pH, Na, K, Ca, Mg, CO3, HCO3, Cl and SO4 values are known but their group are unknown was prepared. And these input values were run in ANN model in order to see how the waters were grouped. The advantages of artificial neural networks can be exploited to solve this problem. The most common ANN architecture is Multilayered Perceptrons, which was used in this study. For this solution, the first artificial neural network model using Extended Delta-Bar-Delta (EDBD) algorithm has been successfully implemented. Mean Square Error result of these model obtained by EDBD algorithm is 1.3x10(-3). These results show that the group in which the waters in the study area fall can be determined with high accuracy by using some parameters of water such as the ion content of water.

Its bottom is characterized by longer deep sections and shorter shallow thresholds. The relatively steady flow and the depth of the water ensure favourable navigation conditions throughout most of the year, even up-stream from the area of the Roman and medieval harbour at Breg and Dolge njive. Our present knowledge about underwater sites had been limited to a section alongside the early Roman period fortified settlement at Dolge njive, where the riverbed had already been researched by divers of the Austro-Hungarian navy in 1884 and a century later also by the team of the National museum. The material found during preventive research of the riverbed at Verd and Vrhnika in 2006 and 2007 extends over a long period of time from the Copper Age until recent times. Individual earthenware fragments and part of a horn axe attributed to the Copper Age strengthen the hypothesis about the vicinity of a lake dwelling expressed already 120 years ago. Among the discovered prehistoric material earthenware from the middle and late Bronze Age is most numerous and appears in assemblages and among single finds. The relatively good preservation and composition of vessels could indicate their affiliation to grave inventories or remains of a settlement complex. The prehistoric predecessor of Nauport should in all likelihood be sought in the wider area of the Mala and Velika Ljubljanica confluence. Surprisingly, fragments of Celtic and Italic transport- and tableware are rare in the discussed section in comparison to rich find assemblages from the riverbed along the early Roman period fortified settlement at Dolge njive. The number of finds increases at the end of the high Middle Ages. Fragments of kitchenware pots and lids from between the 13(th) and 17(th) century are prevalent, engraved earthenware and glass from the 16(th) and 17(th) centuries also appear. Stone blocks were also documented in the riverbed, proving the chronologically yet indeterminable transportation of building material from karstic areas around the Retovje and Mocilnik springs. Most of the finds were discovered in secondary position, without a recognizable connection with the structures or other chronologically closed assemblages, an exception is the layer with kitchen refuse from the 16(th) and 17(th) centuries.																			1408-5348						2008	18	2					407	430																WOS:000263083100011
J	Ports, MA				Ports, Mark A.			Terrestrial snails and slugs of Nevada, USA: an overview of taxa, biogeography, and habitat affinities	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												The biogeography and habitat affinities of the Recent taxa of terrestrial mollusks of Nevada, western USA, are discussed herein. A total of 52 land snails and slug species were found in Nevada, of which 21 are newly reported records. Two native land snails found previously were not found by this author, and 6 additional species are possible for the state. Of the 47 species of land snail found in the state, 42 are considered native, while 5 are introduced. Only one slug, Deroceras laeve, is considered native, while 4 others are introduced. Land mollusks in eastern and central Nevada are derived from the Rocky Mountain Molluscan Province, such as Pupilla hehes, Microphysula ingersolli, and Oreohelix strigosa depressa (9 species, 18%), while southern Nevada supports species derived from the Southwestern Province, such as Gastrocopta spp., Striatura meridionalis, and Eremarionta rowelli (8 species, 16%). A Californian and Oregonian influence includes Pristiloma chersinella and Punctum californicum. Introduced land snails and slugs such as Deroceras reticulaturn, Lehmannia valentiana, Cepaea nemoralis, and Rumina decollata are found in the gardens and parks of urban areas in Nevada. The present native land snail distributions in Nevada result from Miocene and Pliocene dispersal and establishment in the mountains of the Great Basin followed by Pleistocene and Holocene fragmentation and isolation. Xeric habitats such as sagebrush steppe, Pygmy conifer woodlands, and dry alkaline lake beds dominate much of the state and support very few or no land mollusks. Nine habitats are identified as being used by terrestrial mollusks in Nevada. Mountain woodlands, springs, and chaparral support 71% of the total fauna, which includes 36 land snail species and the slug Deroceras laeve where water, coniferous and deciduous vegetation, and moist litter are available between 1400 and 2800 m elevation. The more xeric Mojave Desert in the south (165-1100 m) and sagebrush steppe of the Great Basin (800-2000 m) support 3 and 4 species, respectively. The Pygmy coniferous woodlands occasionally support 2 species, except when the woodlands are associated with limestone cliffs and shrubs, where 5 species may be present (1600-2200 m). River valleys, perennial streams, and meadows (800-2000 m) make up only 1% of the state's land area but support 19 species of land mollusks. Subalpine and alpine habitats in the high mountains (2800-3400 m) support 13 species of land snails. Urban areas with greenhouses, parks, and casino gardens support 9 species of introduced land snails and slugs.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				OCT	2021	81	3					407	426																WOS:000725593800005

Currently only the Kumho Zn-Pb mine remains in production, while magnetite skarns are mined as iron ore at the old Yomisan and Ulsan base metal deposits. Base metal skarns within Korea fall into two groups; those hosted in Cambro-Ordovician limestone sequences, situated mainly in sub-basins in the northeast of the peninsula and those hosted within carbonate volcaniclastics of the Cretaceous Gyeongsang Basin, in the southeast. Sulphide mineralisation is dominated by sphalerite, lesser galena, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite, with subordinate chalcopyrite and molybdenite with Ag-Co credits. Skarns are composed of pyroxene-clinopyroxene-garnet-carbonate-quartz and magnetite, grading into silica-chlorite hornfels. Most of the significant deposits display both pipe-like and stratabound morphology. In the Hwanggang district, a zoned distribution of Ordovician carbonate hosted, polymetallic Mo-W and Zn-Pb-Cu-Ag base metal deposits is observed around the margin of a Cretaceous granite intrusion. Similar polymetallic zoning is recognised in the Sangdong district, where deposits include Sangdong (W), Abisan (Au-As) and Yomisan Northwest (Zn-Mo) and Yomisan Southeast (Zn-Cu-Co), hosted in Ordovician carbonates in proximity to Cretaceous quartz porphyry intrusives. The Taebaeksan district hosts the largest deposits at the Yeonwha group of mines. Although production ceased in 1993, significant resources remain, hosted in Ordovician limestone and dolomite that have been intruded by Cretaceous quartz porphyry dykes. Deposits in the Cretaceous Gyeongsang Basin consist of bedding concordant, vertically stacked base metal skarn mineralisation at several stratigraphic horizons, connected by carbonate-base metal veins with a pipe-like geometry. Evidence such as massive sulphide layers and restricted proximal carbonates suggest mineralisation was initially partly syn-depositional, with both base metals and carbonate venting onto a lake floor, bring reconstituted to skarns by later magmatic activity. Skarn mineralisation is universally closely associated with the Cretaceous Bulgugsa Series acid intrusive activity. A common intrusive-structural relationship is recognised at some deposits, with bedding plane and imbricate thrust faulting, introducing felsic intrusives as sills. These intrusions probably introduced the base metals, carbonate, boron, heat and silica, which metasomatically reconstituted the carbonate lithologies to form skarn assemblages. The Korean base metal skarn deposits are regarded as Zn-Pb chimney-manto skarns and display similarities to the Mexican manto type deposits.																					1-875776-71-0				1999	99	4					247	254																WOS:000085170400028

Considerable attention has been devoted to nitrogen (N) sources of NO3- deposits in recent years due to the increase in demand for NO3- fertilizers in agriculture and chemical industries. However, although the potassium nitrate (KNO3) deposits in the Uyunbulak salt lake in the Kumish basin, Xinjiang, China, have received increasing attention from numerous researchers in recent years, they all focused on the study of nitrate sources and agreed that the nitrate source in the Kumish basin is mainly atmospheric sedimentation. Studies on their water sources are scarce; for salt lake nitrate deposits, water supply also plays a crucial role in the genesis of the deposit. As a sensitive indicator, a boron isotope is often used to indicate water bodies from different sources. However, the presence of NO3- ions in water will interfere with the determination of boron isotopes, so the research on boron isotopes in nitrate salt lakes has been hindered. In this study, the three-step ion exchange method published by Ma et al. (2020) was used to eliminate the influence of NO3- ions in water on boron isotope determination, so as to reveal the water supply of Uyunbulak Salt Lake in Kumish basin by using boron isotopes which are more sensitive to water types. In this study, ice and snow meltwater, fissure water, groundwater, and surface water samples were collected from the Kumish basin and analyzed for the determination of boron (B) isotopic and hydrochemical compositions during the migration process of water bodies to reveal the recharge relationship between the water bodies from the northwestern margin of the basin and the study area. The obtained hydrochemical composition results showed a gradual increase in the salinity of the water body from 556 to 7372 mg/L from the northwestern to the southeastern parts of the basin, resulting in a gradual change in the hydrochemical facies type of Uyunbulak salt lake to NaCl. This finding suggested that the water body migrates from the northwestern to southeastern parts of the basin. The results of B isotope composition indicated two types of water bodies from different sources, namely, the ice and snow meltwater of the Southern part of the Tianshan Mountains and groundwater of the basin, exhibiting B isotope composition ranges of 26.66-27.26% and 12.75-15.19%, respectively. These two types of water bodies are mixed at the Uzong spring (Q1). The ice and snow meltwater in the mixed water accounted for 46%, while the groundwater accounted for 54%. The mixed water continues to recharge the Uyunbulak Salt Lake in the southeastern part of the basin.					海, 清玉/GQO-8416-2022; Ma, Yunqi/LZH-2495-2025														1468-8115	1468-8123				APR 5	2023	2023								5099233	10.1155/2023/5099233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/5099233													WOS:000972996400001

Human alteration of global surface water storage variability	NATURE												Knowing the extent of human influence on the global hydrological cycle is essential for the sustainability of freshwater resources on Earth(1,2). However, a lack of water level observations for the world's ponds, lakes and reservoirs has limited the quantification of human-managed (reservoir) changes in surface water storage compared to its natural variability(3). The global storage variability in surface water bodies and the extent to which it is altered by humans therefore remain unknown. Here we show that 57 per cent of the Earth's seasonal surface water storage variability occurs in human-managed reservoirs. Using measurements from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which was launched in late 2018, we assemble an extensive global water level dataset that quantifies water level variability for 227,386 water bodies from October 2018 to July 2020. We find that seasonal variability in human-managed reservoirs averages 0.86 metres, whereas natural water bodies vary by only 0.22 metres. Natural variability in surface water storage is greatest in tropical basins, whereas human-managed variability is greatest in the Middle East, southern Africa and the western USA. Strong regional patterns are also found, with human influence driving 67 per cent of surface water storage variability south of 45 degrees north and nearly 100 per cent in certain arid and semi-arid regions. As economic development, population growth and climate change continue to pressure global water resources(4), our approach provides a useful baseline from which ICESat-2 and future satellite missions will be able to track human modifications to the global hydrologic cycle.

APPLICATION OF A 6DOF ALGORITHM FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF IMPULSE WAVES GENERATED DUE TO SUB-AERIAL LANDSLIDES	VII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN MARINEENGINEERING (MARINE2017)					7th International Conference on Computational Methods in Marine Engineering (MARINE)	MAY 15-17, 2017	Nantes, FRANCE					Inland water bodies such as lakes, rivers and streams are generally considered safe from extreme wave events. Such inland water bodies are susceptible to extreme wave events due to impact of aerial landslides, where a large mass of land impacts the water at high velocities, resulting in a sudden transfer of momentum to the water body. Similar events can occur due to an underwater landslide as well. The evaluation of such extreme events in inland water bodies and the impact of such extreme waves on the regions adjacent to the water body is essential to assess the safety of the constructions on the banks of the water bodies. The generation of extreme waves due to aerial and sub-aerial landslides depends on several parameters such as the height of fall, the composition of the impacting land mass and the bottom slope of the water body. In this paper, the 6DOF algorithm implemented in the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model REEF3D is used to simulate the motion of a sliding wedge impacting the water free surface. This is used to represent a sliding landmass impacting water after a landslide event. The wedge is represented using a primitive triangular surface mesh and a ray-tracing algorithm is used to determine the position of the object with respect to the underlying grid. Further, the level set method is then used to represent the solid boundary. The motion of the wedge is obtained by propagating the level set equation. The interaction of the wedge with the free water surface is obtained in a sharp and accurate manner using the level set method for both the water free surface and the solid boundary. REEF3D uses a staggered Cartesian numerical grid with a fifth-order WENO scheme for convection discretisation and a third-order Runge-Kutta scheme for time advancement. With the higher-order methods and the level set method, the model can be used to calculate detailed flow information such as the pressure changes in the water on impact and the associated deformation of the water free surface. The accurate representation of these characteristics is essential for correctly evaluating the height and period of the generated extreme wave and associated properties such as the wave celerity and wave run up on the banks during the extreme event.

There are plenty of examples and efforts underway within US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) that are moving us to a fully integrated system. The President's Executive Order 13547, outlines our policy to achieve "an America whose stewardship ensures that the ocean, our coasts, and the Great Lakes are healthy and resilient, safe and productive, and understood and treasured so as to promote the wellbeing, prosperity, and security of present and future generations." For US IOOS to be a vital contributor to this goal we suggest a need to move beyond Integration to become "Interdependent" and "Indispensible." Given the current fiscal climate, no one agency, entity or program can act alone. The scientific information needed to guide personal and programmatic decisions necessitates taking the next step to interdependence. Are we ready to take that step? Interdependences also refer to the fact that the subsystems can not stand alone. To deliver necessary capabilities IOOS elements must progress from the research and development stages, through efficient test and operational efforts into routine operations. Technologies must be incubated and rapidly inserted to keep the US IOOS system operating effectively and efficiently. Prompt delivery of meaningful output to the end user demands a fully interdependent system. One in which the models and observations are standardized and work seamlessly together to rapidly tailor the output to users' needs. But interdependence also suggests that each partner be it at the Federal, State, Local and Tribal level or the Private sector needs to be there for the long term. The analogy is really the three legged stool. Once you become interdependent, if one of the partners pulls back the stool falls when ability for the other partners/legs are unable to support the enterprise. This demands not only policy and technology, but trust. Once partners and programs are fully interdependent they become indispensible. This paper will provide examples within IOOS that suggests the move is underway. The paper will provide an update on the US IOOS Blueprint to Full Capability, will provide examples of observation networks that rely on multiple partnerships to remain viable, and how the information, products and services are now have been fully endorsed by managers and decision makers.																					978-0-933957-39-8				2011																								WOS:000299005800055
J	Dursun, I				Dursun, Ibrahim			An integrated analytical approach to sub-watershed prioritization and erosion risk assessment in the salda lake basin, Türkiye	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Prioritizing basins according to their morphometry parameters is crucial for elucidating the soil erosion process. Before developing a watershed management plan, it is crucial to comprehend the morphometry of the basin. The research aims to evaluate the erosion risk in the basin using the ICONA (Institute for the COnservation of the Nature) erosion risk classification to help decision-makers prioritize basins by determining which sub-watersheds should be the focus of soil and water protection activities in accordance with the Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods. This study was conducted in the internationally important Salda Lake Basin located in the Mediterranean region of T & uuml;rkiye. The basin is divided into 23 sub-watersheds. In this context, only 12 parameters, (Rb, Lsm, Rl, Lo, Ff, Re, Rc, Dd, Cc, R, Rr, Rn) with strong or good correlations were used in the PCA approach. These parameters were also used in the WSA method. According to the PCA method, SWs (16-18-20) are the most prioritized sub-watersheds with compound parameter values of 7.08, 7.83, and 9.83, respectively, whereas according to the WSA method, SW (16-18-19) are the highest priority sub-watersheds with compound parameter values of 5.25, 7.14, and 8.43, respectively. Prioritization ranks of 8 sub-watersheds: namely, SWs (1-4-6-7-9-16-18-22) are common in PCA-WSA. Moreover, the results are very similar, except in the common sub-watersheds. According to the ICONA categorization system for erosion risk, 82.37% of the Salda Lake Basin falls within the very low and low group. It was discovered that the high and very high categories accounted for 12.12%. Since traditional watershed prioritization methods are both costly and time-consuming, methods such as PCA and WSA are recommended. The combined use of PCA and WSA methods is considered useful for developing long-term strategies for the prevention of soil erosion as well as catchment protection priorities. The ICONA erosion risk classification is consistent with the PCA and WSA catchment prioritization. Owing to such basin prioritization studies, decision-makers can prevent erosion, and flood disasters and minimize damage on a sub-watershed basis by managing basins and taking necessary measures.

High geothermal activity within its caldera maintains an ice-covered caldera lake with variable water level. Large floods from the lake (j & ouml;kulhlaups) are initiated when the water breaks through an ice dam and flows out of the caldera. In several cases the falling lake level is known to have triggered eruptions of the volcano, e.g, in 1922, 1934, and 2004. The eruptions of 1983, 1998, and 2011, however, were not triggered by j & ouml;kulhlaups, and most j & ouml;kulhlaups have not triggered eruptions, including those of 2008 and 2010. All these processes, i.e. volcanic activity, water floods, and geothermal activity, are accompanied by seismic tremor that is detectable by the surrounding network of seismic stations. By comparing tremorplots of the j & ouml;kulhlaups of 2008 and 2010, and the eruptions of 2004 and 2011, we can identify three types of tremor: Water flood tremor. J & ouml;kulhlaups from the caldera are always accompanied by high-frequency tremor (2-9 Hz), recorded on the seismic stations near the caldera. It starts when the lake level begins to drop and increases gradually with increasing water discharge from the lake. This tremor is usually detected a few days before the subglacial flood reaches the glacier edge. Geothermal tremor. The second type of tremor appears to be switched on when the drop in water level reaches 10-30 m. It remains after all water has been drained from the lake. The tremor is characterized by relatively high frequency (2-6 Hz) and sudden changes in amplitude. The distance range of this tremor is short, it is seldom recorded beyond the edge of the glacier. We suggest that it is generated by flash-boiling of the geothermal system within the caldera, triggered by the pressure drop of the lake level. Eruption tremor. Eruptions of Gr & iacute;msv & ouml;tn are accompanied by tremor that begins simultaneously with the eruption and is distinctly different from the other two types of tremor. It contains lower frequencies (0.5-4 Hz) and has a wider distance range. It is recorded beyond the edge of the glacier, possibly because of its frequency content, but other effects such as crustal structure and depth of the tremor sources may also play a part.																			0449-0576						2023		73					55	74		10.33799/jokull2023.73.055	http://dx.doi.org/10.33799/jokull2023.73.055													WOS:001215367700002

The Izumo Plain and Lake Shinji belong to Paleo-Shinji Bay, an east-west incised valley formed during the Last Glacial Maximum and drowned by the early Holocene sea-level rise. Using micro-XRF, CNS elemental analysis, grain size, diatom analysis, and robust radiocarbon dates for three newly collected cores from the plain, complemented by three previously studied cores from the plain and Lake Shinji, five depositional phases have been identified. The phases include estuarine to coastal plain (up to 9.8 cal. kyBP), transgressive central basin (9.8-7.7 cal. kyBP), regressive central basin (7.7-3.7 cal. kyBP), regressive inner central basin (3.7-0.7 cal. kyBP), and delta front (<0.7 cal. kyBP). Beginning at similar to 10.2 cal. kyBP, marine inundation caused by early Holocene sea-level rise shifted deposition from fluvial gravel to muddy sediment in the transgressive central basin. The high sediment accumulation during the transgression suggests that coastal erosion transported sediment into the bay. The regressive central basin, driven by decelerated sea-level rise, is characterized by thinly laminated muddy sediments deposited at a lower accumulation rate due to the shallowness of the bay mouth and the topography of the depression, resulting in anoxic conditions. Northward progradation of a bay-side delta began at similar to 6.5 cal. kyBP, eventually dividing the regressive central basin into western and eastern basins by similar to 3.7 cal. kyBP, with the eastern inner basin evolving into a more enclosed environment. By 0.7 cal. kyBP, intensified bay-side delta expansion, caused by a change in the main river channel, partially filled the eastern inner basin and formed the Izumo Plain. However, the unfilled estuary, now known as Lake Shinji, remained in a coastal lake. The infill history of Paleo-Shinji Bay was characterized by rapid marine sediment accumulation during the early Holocene sea-level rise, followed by bay-side delta progradation during the later Holocene under relatively stable to falling sea levels, providing insights into the evolution of estuarine infill in wave-dominated systems.					; Nakamura, Yasuhide/V-2310-2018; Saito, Yoshiki/O-9087-2019	SAITO, Yoshiki/0000-0003-3212-6356; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 15	2025	670								112941	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112941													WOS:001473895900001

These are geological formations which are unique by their shape, structure, texture, specific features and beauty. Usually are considered whole rock massifs and successions or individual bedrocks, groups of picturesque beds and elements of these formations and rock bodies(earth and stone pyramids and stone rivers, rock windows and bridges, niches and caves in the rocks, karstic gorges, ponors, karstic dams and all other karstic forms). Eroded alluvial formations and terraces, river valleys and tectonic grabens are also among them. Areas and sites of unique fossils and fossil accumulations, petrified trees and forests, extinct volcanoes and products of their activity are also present. A variety of sand and sand dunes and stones, coastal banks and bands, lakes, bays, swamps, water falls, pits, localities of ancient mines, quarries and excavations are also included. Besides of the protected natural geologic sites the classic geologic, sections and outcrops known as natural geologic museums, as well as the deposits and occurrences of rare minerals and crystals and mineral individuals having beautiful and large crystal forms (natural mineralogical museums) and also different genetic or morphologic types of ore deposits are to be mentioned. As a whole, all listed natural geologic phenomena are of great significance for the geology of Bulgaria since they provide valuable data and evidences for the regional geologic development of the area of the country and of the Balkan Peninsula during entire geologic history. As subjects of natural beauty they all are of great aesthetic and emotional impact. The natural geologic sites well known and considered here and everywhere as a national geologic heritage are imposed, however, on immediate effect of different natural agents and geologic processes and could be under direct influence of men and of their behaviour. No doubt in this case that the natural features and phenomena could be damaged or destroyed in such a way and extent so that no natural or artificial restoration and cultivation can any longer be used to recover the natural beauty. The protection of the heritage requires quick building of a state monitoring and watching system. Additional sites and localities could be included into the natural geologic heritage of the country in order to be protected and left to the coming generations. Many of the existing and newly established sites could be forwarded for the inclusion to the Lists of the World, European and Balkan heritage. They all will meet the established international standards.																					90-5410-877-0				1997							3027	3032																WOS:A1997BJ46T00512
C	Men, H; Peng, Y; Zhang, J; Yang, SR; Xu, ZM			ASME	Men, Hong; Peng, Yan; Zhang, Jing; Yang, Shanrang; Xu, Zhiming			STUDY ON BIOCORROSION INDUCED BY SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA ON HEAT EXCHANGER MATERIAL IN COOLING WATER	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL HEAT TRANSFER CONFERENCE - 2010, VOL 4: HEAT TRANSFER MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES, HEAT TRANSFER EQUIPMENT, THERMOELECTRICS					14th International Heat Transfer Conference	AUG 08-13, 2010	Washington, DC					Corrosion associated with microorganisms has been recognized for over 50 years and yet the study of microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is relatively new. MIC can occur in diverse environments. Industrial cooling water from rivers, lakes and sea water contain lots of microorganisms which are able to grow and multiply under certain conditions when pH, water temperature and sunlight etc are suitable. MIC is one of key cause of heat exchanger faults. MIC of heat exchanger materials in cooling waters has caused expensive unplanned outages, the need for local repairs and, in some cases, completes system replacement. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are the main harmful bacteria in circulating cooling water. Under anaerobic conditions, SRB reproduce a lot to produce mucus, which speed up the formation of corrosion, erode the metal equipment, plug the pipeline, affect the efficiency of heat transfer, and bring a lot of inconvenience to the production. The corrosion behaviors of 304 stainless steel induced by SRB were studied by measuring the polarization curves, electrochemical impedance Spectrum, weight loss measurements of fore-and-aft biocorrosion, and electrochemical noise method. The electrochemical noise signal of 304 stainless steel corrosion were de- noised by using a wavelet threshold de-noising method, which made the quadratic biorthogonal spline wavelet as the mother wavelet and adopted an soft threshold processing function. The result showed that the slope of cathodic polarization curves measured included with SRB is lower than the one obtained without SRB, while the slope of anodic polarization curves is higher than it. It is concluded that the process of anode polarization was repressed at the presence of SRB. With the growth of the culture time, the value of electrochemical impedance without bacteria reduced at first, then rose, while with bacteria fell at all times. It indicated that SRB accelerated the corrosion of stainless steel. With the dipping time, a biofilm, under which corrosion products congregate to form local battery corrosion, was formed on the surface of stainless steel, so that the serious pitting corrosion is induced. The results from electrochemical noise method showed that the quadratic biorthogonal spline wavelet much smoother and it can remove the noise from the electrochemical noise effectively, and can effectively identify the location of the sudden changes in the signal and accurately reflect the useful information of the signal. The more useful information and data about biocorrosion induced by SRB are also gotten.					peng, yan/GRX-5902-2022																978-0-7918-4939-2				2010							573	582																WOS:000307206500069

This study mostly focuses on 13 Desember 2016 only. The typical synoptic pattern of lake-effect snowstorm induced easterly in the Yeongdong region. Clouds generated due to high temperature difference between 850 hPa and sea surface (SST) penentrated in the Yeongdong region along with northerly and northeasterly, which eventually resulted precipitation. The cloud base height before the precipitation changed from 750 m to 1,280 m, which was in agreement with that from ceilometer at Sokcho. However, ceilometer tended to detect the cloud base 50 m similar to 100 m below strong signal of lidar backscattering coefficient. As a result, the depolarization ratio increased vertically while the backscattering coefficient decreased about 1,010 m similar to 1,200 m above the ground. Lidar signal might be interpreted to be attenuated with the penetration depth of the cloud layer with of nonspherical hydrometeor (snow, ice cloud). An increase in backscattering signal and a decrease in depolarization ratio occured in the layer of 800 to 1,010 m, probably being associated with an increase in non-spherical particles. There seemed to be a shallow liquid layer with a low depolarization ratio (<0.1) in the layer of 850 similar to 900 m. As the altitude increases in the 680 m similar to 850 m, the backscattering coefficient and depolarization ratio increase at the same time. In this range of height, the maximum value (0.6) is displayed. Such a result can be inferred that the nonspherical hydrometeor are distributed by a low density. At this time, the depolarization ratio and the backscattering coefficient did not increase under observed melting layer of 680 m. The lidar has a disadvantage that it is difficult for its beam to penetrate deep into clouds due to attenuation problem. However it is promising to distinguish hydrometeor morphology by utilizing the depolarization ratio and the backscattering coefficient, since its vertical high resolution (2.5 m) enable us to analyze detailed cloud microphysics. It would contribute to understanding cloud microphysics of cold clouds and snowfall when remote sensings including lidar, radar, and in-situ measurements could be timely utilized altogether.

The Lingjiatan site, which is located at the southeast of Chaohu City, Anhui Province, and 35 km north to the Yangtze River and 5 km south to the Taihu Mountain, is the most representative Neolithic Age site with advanced jade-carving techniques in this area. The 14C date of Lingjiatan Site is about 5600 similar to 5300aBP, the same time as the Hongshan culture and earlier than the Liangzhu culture, which falls into the Mid-Holocene epoch. Based on mid-high resolution remote sensing images and former archaeological materials, combined with field investigations and sampling analysis of the archaeological site profile of Lingjiatan Site as well as core drillings in the Chaohu Lake, the paper reconstructs the climate environment of the Lingjiatan site and the environmental background of ancient human activities during Mid-Holocene. The research results show that: (1) The ancients in Lingjiatan lived in the Holocene Optimum, its culture development was during the interim phase when the climate transformed from warm and wet to cool and dry. (2) The ground surface deposited in the last phase of late Pleistocene epoch (OSL dating is 11.6 +/- 1.0 ka BP) was the living ground for Lingjiatan ancient humans. The sedimentary discontinuous surface may be caused by strong fluvial erosion under the warm and humid climatic conditions of the Mid-Holocene. (3) Originally, paleo-geomorphic surface was a level shallow mesa foreside southern part of Taihu Mountain, but was cut by fluvial waters and the geomorphologic configuration formed "finger-like" features alternately with strip hillocks and rivers. These features can be seen on the Landsat ETM+ remote sensing image, especially the depression area. This depression is now cropland, and was interpreted as the palaeochannels. (4) Based on the remote sensing image interpretation, the site was in a "peninsula shape" environment which had rivers flowing around the east, west and south sides of the Changgang terrain and that was good for rice planting, hunting, fishing and water transportation. (5) The most particular characteristic of the Lingjiatan site is the advanced jade production, those maybe have some relationship with the convenient shipping, trade exchanges and optimal environmental conditions, which was also conducive to rice cultivation.

J	Goulet, S; Assani, AA; Roy, A				Goulet, Samuel; Assani, Ali Arkamose; Roy, Alexandre			Water Level Temporal Variability of Lake Mégantic during the Period 1920-2020 and Its Impacts on the Frequency of Heavy Flooding of the Chaudière River (Quebec, Canada)	HYDROLOGY												The objective of this study is to analyze the temporal variability in water levels of Lake M & eacute;gantic (27.4 km2) during the period 1920-2020 in relation to anthropogenic and natural factors on the one hand, and its impact on the intensity and frequency of heavy flooding (recurring floods >= 10 years) of the Chaudi & egrave;re River of which it is the source, on the other hand. The application of four different Mann-Kendall tests showed a significant decrease in lake water levels during this period. The Lombard test revealed two breaks in the average daily maximum and average water levels, but only one break in the average daily minimum water levels. The first shift, which was smoothed, occurred between 1957 and 1963. It was caused by the demolition in 1956 of the first dam built in 1893 and the significant storage of water in the dams built upstream of the lake between 1956 and 1975. The second shift, which was rather abrupt, occurred between 1990 and 1993. It was caused by the voluntary and controlled lowering of the lake's water levels in 1993 to increase the surface area of the beaches for recreational purposes. However, despite this influence of anthropogenic factors on this drop in water levels, they are negatively correlated with the global warming climate index. It is therefore a covariation, due to anthropogenic factors whose impacts are exerted at different spatial scales, without a physical causal link. However, the winter daily minimum water levels, whose temporal variability has not been influenced by anthropogenic activities, are positively correlated with the NAO and AO indices, but negatively with PDO. Finally, since the transformation of Lake M & eacute;gantic into a reservoir following the construction of the M & eacute;gantic dam in 1893 and 1973 to control heavy flooding in the Chaudi & egrave;re River, all recurrent floods >= 10 years have completely disappeared in the section of this river located downstream of Lake M & eacute;gantic. However, the disappearance of these floods and the drop in water levels of Lake M & eacute;gantic have not significantly impacted the stationarity in the flow series of the Chaudi & egrave;re River since 1920.																				2306-5338				SEP	2024	11	9							130	10.3390/hydrology11090130	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology11090130													WOS:001323857100001
J	Brooks, GR; Medioli, BE; Telka, AM				Brooks, Gregory R.; Medioli, Barbara E.; Telka, Alice M.			Evidence of early Holocene closed-basin conditions in the Huron-Georgian basins from within the North Bay outlet of the upper Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sub-bottom profiling and coring were undertaken at eight sub-basins along the lower French River and at five small lakes near North Bay, Ontario, to collect stratigraphical and chronological evidence to investigate whether lakes occupying the Huron-Georgian basins during the early- to mid-Holocene became hydrologically closed. All of the coring sites are located within the route of the North Bay outlet that carried outflow from the upper Great Lakes during this period. Sand beds containing organic detritus are present within five cores from Muskrat, Crombie and Deep bays that otherwise are composed of glaciolacustrine rhythmites or fine-grained lacustrine deposits. These sand beds are interpreted to represent intervals when water levels within the sub-basins were lower than present, based on chronology, sediment texture, and macrofossil assemblages. It is inferred that the water surface in the Huron-Georgian basins fell below the level of the Dalles Rapids sill isolating the lower French River sub-basins from the large lake. A core from Depensier Lake, North Bay, contains an organic-rich sand interval within a thicker sand unit barren of organic materials. Macrofossils within this organic-rich interval are interpreted to be evidence of substantially diminished flow through the North Bay outlet channel. Radiocarbon dates of terrestrial macrofossils provide correlation of the sand beds between the French River cores as well as with the organic-rich sand in the Depensier Lake core. The possibility that the sand beds in the French River cores represent flood deposits rather than evidence of hydrologically closed conditions is considered, but rejected, based on the occurrence of multiple peaty layers and the record of shallow water conditions inferred from macrofossils within the upper sand bed of core MUS1, Muskrat Bay, in combination with the evidence of quiescent depositional conditions from similarly aged macrofossils in the core from Depensier Lake. Eight radiocarbon dates from the French River cores are incorporated into an elevation-age plot of paleo-indicators of water levels in the Huron-Georgian basins, using additional data from the literature. This plot and stratigraphic evidence from the Muskrat Bay cores indicates that separate closed-basin intervals occurred between 9.0 and 8.4, and 9.5 and 9.3 ka cal BP (similar to 8.1 and 7.6, and similar to 8.5 and 8.3 ka BP). The occurrence of these two closed-basin intervals between 9.6 and 8.4 ka cal BP (similar to 8.7 and 7.6 ka BP) implies that run-off derived exclusively from precipitation within the non-glaciated portions of the upper Great Lakes drainage basins was likely insufficient at this time to support an open-basin lake hydrology during the contemporary climate, which was colder and drier than present, without being supplemented from glacial Lake Agassiz overflow and/or Laurentide Ice Sheet meltwater.

J	BURTON, GW; ODUM, EP				BURTON, GW; ODUM, EP			THE DISTRIBUTION OF STREAM FISH IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNTAIN-LAKE, VIRGINIA	ECOLOGY												A detailed longitudinal survey of fishes of 5 streams near Mountain Lake; Va., was made over a 3-summer period, 1939-41. Stations were established every 1-2 mi. and worked extensively with seines :and dipnets. 3 of the streams, namely, Little Stony, Sinking Creek, and Spruce Run, are tributaries of the New River (Mississippi drainage) and 2 of the streams, namely, Johns and Craig creeks, flow into the James River (Atlantic drainage). The streams varied in length from 5-34 mi.; stations varied in altitude from 3800 to 1200 ft., in pH from 5.6 to 8.2, and in water temp. from 15[degree] to 22[degree] C. There was a marked longitudinal succession of fishes in all of the streams, changes being more pronounced the greater the altitude change, but distinct differences occurring with but little altitude change. Of the various environmental complexes considered temp., stream size, and gradient of flow appeared to be the most important factors in determining distribution within the streams studied. A temp. of 19[degree] C consistently marked the downstream limit of brook trout (Salvelinus f. fontinalis). Introduced rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii irideus) occurred mostly in waters warmer than 19[degree] but were well established only where the gradient was 100 ft./mile or greater. Spruce Run and Sinking Creek demonstrated the effect of stream size since other factors did not vary greatly from source to mouth. These streams showed a gradual increase in number of spp. longitudinally, and headwater spp. tended to range the length of the stream. Gradient of flow appears to be very important and special attention was paid to this factor. The discontinuous distribution of a number of wide ranging spp., e.g., Micropterus d. dolomieu, Rhinichthys atratulus, Thoburnia rho-thoeca, and Catanotus f. flabellaris, seemed to be especially well correlated with sharp changes in stream gradient. No obvious correlation between pH and observed distribution was found, although pH may influence abundance. A conspicuous decrease in both spp. and numbers in the lower half of Johns Creek may possibly be correlated with such biotic factors as impoverished land or the presence of Esox. Of the 31 native spp., only 12 were common to both drainages. 3 of these (Campostoma anomalum, Rhinichthys atratulus, Coitus bairdii), are represented by distinct subspp. in the 2 drainages. Noteworthy occurrences include: Parexoglossum laurae and Poecilichthys osburni (members of highly distinctive and relict Kanawha fauna) in New River tributaries; Nocomis leptocephalus and N. micropogon in both drainages; Notropis albeolus and Nocomis leptocephalus (Atlantic coast forms) in the New River system.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1945	26	2					182	194		10.2307/1930823	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930823													WOS:A1945XX03500007
J	Kennedy, K; Eyles, N				Kennedy, Kirsten; Eyles, Nicholas			The Paleoproterozoic (c. 2.3 Ga) Gowganda Formation: Deep water, glacially-influenced debrites and related mass flow along a passive margin	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Gowganda Formation (ca. 2.3 Ga) of the Huronian Supergroup in Northern Ontario, Canada is the best- preserved stratigraphic record of a Paleoproterozoic glaciogenic environment in the world. The Lower Gowganda has been ascribed to a putative panglacial 'Snowball Earth' event despite little agreement as to its origins, paleotectonic and paleogeographic setting, and paleolatitude. The present study leverages a large database of previous field investigations with new sedimentological, structural and basin analysis data that shows that Gowganda facies record glacially-influenced, subaqueous, gravity-driven mass flow processes in deep water. The Lower Gowganda Formation is dominated by hundred-meter thick amalgamated units of thickly-bedded to massive, chaotically-bedded and graded diamictites. It also contains thick (>50 m) regionally extensive laminated mudstone units ('laminites') with a small number of mostly pebble-grade lonestones, and interbedded graded sandstone and conglomerates. We interpret diamictite facies as debrites formed by downslope subaqueous mixing of large volumes of unstable glacially-derived gravel, sand, and mud. Laminites are distal turbidites with sparse ice-rafted drop stones and outrunner clasts from adjacent debris flows. Interbedded massive and graded conglomerates and sandstones are identified as turbiditic deposits resulting from slumping and resedimentation of basin margin glaciofluvial or nearshore deposits; clast shapes and lithologies are the same as those in diamictites which is key evidence for remixing with mud during mass flow to generate thick regionally- extensive diamictites in a deep water base-of-slope setting. Ice contact, basin margin sediments were not preserved. There are clear sedimentological and paleotectonic parallels between the Gowganda Formation and glacially-influenced successions of younger Neopreoterozoic age indicating a commonality of depositional environments where glaciogenic sediment was recycled and focussed into evolving rifts during continental breakup and along succeeding passive margins. We emphasize the ongoing role of both basement faulting and glacial erosion in creating significant and evolving paleo-topographic relief, giving rise to marked variations in stratal thickness. We conclude that glaciogenic sediments were reworked by gravity and preserved along the tectonically-active passive margin of a recently-rifted Superior Craton during the breakup of Kenorland. Pleistocene glaciogenic sedimentation adjacent to modern uplifted passive basement margins, such as the coast of Norway, is an appropriate tectono-sedimentary analog.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2025	261								105033	10.1016/j.earscirev.2024.105033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2024.105033		JAN 2025											WOS:001409071400001
J	Kilibarda, Z; Graves, N; Dorton, M; Dorton, R				Kilibarda, Zoran; Graves, Nolan; Dorton, Melissa; Dorton, Richard			Changes in beach gravel lithology caused by anthropogenic activities along the southern coast of Lake Michigan, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The southern coast of Lake Michigan is the most urbanized and most densely populated area in the Great Lakes region. Development of steel mills, harbors, and municipalities in NW Indiana and in NE Illinois in the last century and a half altered the nearshore environment so much that native beach gravel (> 8 mm) now exist only in the exhumed paleo-beach remnants from the Nipissing Phase (similar to 4,500 years ago) of Lake Michigan. Native gravel, collected from paleo-beach remnants at Mount Baldy Dune and Beach House Blowout, contain predominantly beach shingle, very platy siltstones (71-78 %), with secondary crystalline pebbles (18 %) in the east, and carbonate pebbles (12 %) in the west. A large amount of anthropogenic fill (steel industry waste, waste from power generating plants, construction debris, railroad, and road fill) has been added since the late 1800s to fill Lake Michigan and expand industrial land. Four areas of major coastal structures-Michigan City Pier and Breakwater, Burns Harbor Pier and Breakwater, Gary Works Pier, and Indiana Harbor Peninsula-altered the natural littoral drift and created four independent sectors on Indiana's coast-Northeastern, Eastern, Central, and Western-between which no natural transfers of coarse sediments occur. Downdrift from the coastal structures, severe beach erosion has prompted extensive beach nourishment with non-native sandy gravel. Four distinct populations of modern beach gravel now exist along Indiana's coast of Lake Michigan: (1) native gravel with diluted beach nourishment influence, (2) native gravel with a minor industrial influence, (3) compact gravel of nourished origin, and (4) anthropogenic gravel of industrial origin. Native gravel with diluted nourishment influence is found in the western, downdrift areas of the Northeastern (from Long Beach to Washington Park Beach) and Eastern Sectors (from eastern Indiana Dunes State Park to western Dune Acres) and contains up to 40 % compact carbonate and crystalline pebbles in addition to native beach shingle. Native gravel with minor industrial influence is found in the Central Sector of Indiana's coast (from central Ogden Dunes to Marquette Beach) and contains predominantly beach shingle, platy clastic lithology, but also up to 30 % of chert and other pebbles released by industry. Compact gravel of nourished origin contains 60-90 % of carbonate and crystalline pebbles, and is found in the eastern, updrift areas of the Northeastern (Michiana Beach and Duneland Beach) and Eastern Sectors (from Crescent Beach to the western Beverly Shores). Anthropogenic gravel of industrial origin contains 70-90 % compact chert and slag and is found in every beach of the Western Sector and in the westernmost beach of the Central Sector. Streams draining into southern Lake Michigan generally contain little coarse sediment except in their channels near the roads and railroads, where angular to subangular anthropogenic pebbles predominate (70-90 %). However, streams have very little influence on gravel lithology along the coast because they seldom discharge anthropogenic gravel into Lake Michigan. Recent changes in gravel lithology along the southern Lake Michigan coast may affect changes in nearshore benthic flora and fauna as well as algal and bacterial blooms during warm summer months.

Intensive surveys of lakes in the Yangtze River floodplain and in Japan estimated the EPLWFG at 6,600 individuals in 2020 compared to 14,000-19,000 in 2016. Waterfowl are easier to count when concentrated in relatively small areas at key times of the year, and the non-breeding and failed breeding elements of the EPLWFG (an estimated 87% of the population) concentrate at remote moulting sites from early July to mid-August during remigial moult. Locations of GPS-tagged EPLWFG (non-breeding birds and failed breeders), which moulted between 25 June and 17 August, recorded during an earlier study, were plotted on maps of the key moulting region, along the San-Yuryakh and Kyuanekhtyakh Rivers which flow into Omulyakhskaya Bay. An aerial survey undertaken in July 2021 aimed to cover as many locations of the tracked individuals as possible, together with Svyatoy Nos Cape and the New Siberian Islands (where the species was also thought to moult), to count the numbers of geese moulting in these areas. Moulting sites on the delta of the Lena River were also surveyed from the air during the EPLWFG moulting periods in 2019 and 2020. Goose groups were photographed and digitally tagged to GPS coordinates, generating a database which included a date/time stamp to the nearest second, coordinates to the nearest 0.000001 degree, and a picture ID. Photographs were processed using Adobe Photoshop V 21.1.3 software. From detection rates in the survey area, we were able to assess the extent of similar habitat elsewhere in the EPLWFG moulting range, to obtain an estimate of the potential total population size. Moulting EPLWFG were found on Bolshoy Lyakhovaskiy Island in the New Siberian Islands, a new site discovered during this study. A total of 9,373 EPLWFG was counted in moulting flocks at all known and newly discovered moulting sites. The extrapolated estimate for the number of non-breeding and failed breeding birds, on taking the expanded area of suitable habitat into account, was of potentially 24,060 geese. Considering that c . 10% of EPLWFG are successful breeders (i.e. remain on their breeding sites and do not join the moulting flocks), we propose that the overall population size could be as high as 26,733 individuals, excluding offspring of the year.

J	DIEHL, S				DIEHL, S			DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF OMNIVORY IN A LITTORAL LAKE COMMUNITY	ECOLOGY												In spite of the ubiquity of omnivory in nature, its consequences for population dynamics have received little attention from theoretical and experimental ecologists. Having three direct consumer-resource links, three indirect numerical links, and a potential for indirect effects mediated by size structure and/or behavioral flexibility, a three-species omnivory system may exhibit complex population dynamics. In 2 x 3 m field enclosures in the littoral zone of a lake, I manipulated the dominating native benthivorous fish (greater than or equal to 2yr-old perch, Perca fluviatilis, omnivorous top consumer) and the dominating native benthic invertebrate predators (Sialis lutaria, Megaloptera, and odonates, intermediate consumers) in three gradients: increasing densities of perch in the near absence of Sialis and odonates, and increasing densities of Sialis and odonates in either the presence or absence of perch. The densities of their common prey (mainly chironomids) were left unmanipulated. Macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and size structure, as well as gut contents of perch and Sialis were sampled monthly over a 3-mo summer period. In the absence of perch, the experimental gradient of Sialis densities remained unchanged over time. In the presence of perch, Sialis decreased by about half at high initial densities, but remained unchanged at low initial densities. Perch also had a negative effect on odonates. In the near absence of Sialis and odonates, perch had a strong, negative effect on chironomids. Compared to enclosures without perch, chironomid abundance was strongly reduced at the lowest perch density, but leveled off with further increases in perch density. Sialis and odonates did not affect chironomid abundance when perch were absent. In contrast, chironomid abundance was positively affected by Sialis and odonates when perch were present. The overall effect of perch on chironomid abundance in the presence of Sialis and odonates was negative. The combined predatory and competitive effects of perch on Sialis and odonates raise the issue how Sialis and odonates coexist with perch. The lack of effect of perch on Sialis and chironomids at low densities of these prey suggests that prey refuges contribute significantly to their persistence in natural systems. The indirect positive effect of Sialis and odonates on chironomids indicates density dependence in per capita interaction coefficients and is most likely to be explained by a behavioral response of perch or chironomids to Sialis and odonates. I suggest that the theoretical and empirical investigation of model systems (such as three-component omnivory systems), which are sufficiently simple to be analytically and experimentally tractable, but still display a richness of common indirect effects, will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of more complex food webs. Their study will benefit from experimental manipulations of more than one population at more than two densities.

O.; Tsyrenzhapov, S., V			Characteristics of opening in the ice cover formed by the gas vents	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												"Proparina" (russ) is a small hole in the ice cover formed by steaming of the ice by the gas vents. Some characteristics of this phenomenon were studied by the example of formation of one proparina found in March 2015 in the ice cover of the shallow eutrophic Lake Shakshinskoye (Trans-Baikal Region). The interest in this object is due to the fact that a proparina, unlike a polynya (small water opening in ice), is formed after the establishment of the ice cover and it can appear in those parts of a reservoir where there is no clearly expressed inflow or outflow of water. Although proparinas do often occur on some water bodies, e.g. Lake Baikal, a detailed description of their structure and process of formation is not available. Research on features of the proparina in the ice of the Lake Shakshinskoye and adjacent areas of this reservoir was carried out on March 25 and 28 in 2015. Melting at the lower and upper ice cover boundaries started at that time, and it was found that the proparina under investigation was formed in the center of a dome-shaped area where the ice thickness decreased compared to the adjoining parts within a distance of 200 meters. Gradient of the lower surface in the dome was on average 5 centimeters per 100 meters at a distance from the center. We found a narrow channel in the ice through which gas came into the proparina in the form of separate portions. The maximum recorded volume of gas that came into the open proparina reached 10 l/min. The channel is supposed to be formed at the end of winter period due to the release of gas during the melting of the lower layers of the ice cover and the subsequent movement of gas bubbles into the center of the dome. To study the ice cover structure, we measured thermo-microwave self-radiation of the "ice-water" system in the centimeter range. Such measurements allow detecting changes in ice thickness with an accuracy of 1 cm. It is assumed that the accumulation of gases under the ice causes the instability of the water column due to warming by the heat flow from the bottom layers and initiates the circulation and, thus, formation of proparina.

Spatial patchiness is a critical factor underlying these activities, influencing biological productivity, nutrient cycling and dynamics across trophic levels. Incorporating spatial dynamics into microbial models is a long-standing challenge, particularly where small-scale turbulence is involved. Here, we combine a fully 3D direct numerical simulation of convective mixed layer turbulence, with an individual-based microbial model to test the key hypothesis that the coupling of gyrotactic motility and turbulence drives intense microscale patchiness. The fluid model simulates turbulent convection caused by heat loss through the fluid surface, for example during the night, during autumnal or winter cooling or during a cold-air outbreak. We find that under such conditions, turbulence-driven patchiness is depth-structured and requires high motility: Near the fluid surface, intense convective turbulence overpowers motility, homogenising motile and non-motile microbes approximately equally. At greater depth, in conditions analogous to a thermocline, highly motile microbes can be over twice as patch-concentrated as non-motile microbes, and can substantially amplify their swimming velocity by efficiently exploiting fast-moving packets of fluid. Our results substantiate the predictions of earlier studies, and demonstrate that turbulence-driven patchiness is not a ubiquitous consequence of motility but rather a delicate balance of motility and turbulent intensity. Author summaryUnderstanding how spatial patchiness in aquatic microbes develops at different scales is crucial for understanding their interactions, their population dynamics, and their role in the wider ecosystem. Patchiness in microbial populations at very small scales is hard to measure or model, particularly where turbulence is involved, and patch formation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we simulated both swimming and passive microbes in a realistic model of small-scale turbulence at an unprecedented resolution. We find that patchiness is triggered far below the surface and only among highly agile swimmers. This demonstrates that microbial patchiness can develop at sub-metre scales within realistic turbulent flows, albeit under restricted conditions. Our results predict that that strong turbulence near the surface of large water bodies (such as oceans and lakes) generated by night-time or cold weather conditions inhibits patch formation, and that patchiness is triggered primarily in deeper waters near the thermocline-a region of transition between warm surface waters and cooler waters at greater depth. Our findings highlight the sensitive balance of conditions needed to trigger patchiness in realistic flows, and demonstrate how small differences in individual behaviour can produce substantially different outcomes in the population as a whole.					; Pawar, Samraat/E-7388-2012; van Reeuwijk, Maarten/C-2708-2008; van Sebille, Erik/F-6781-2010	van Reeuwijk, Maarten/0000-0003-4840-5050; Pawar, Samraat/0000-0001-8375-5684; Piggott, Matthew/0000-0002-7526-6853; Christensen, Alexander Kier/0000-0002-7339-1845; van Sebille, Erik/0000-0003-2041-0704													1553-734X	1553-7358				JUL	2022	18	7							e1010291	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010291								35895753					WOS:000955058800001

SNOW IN THE YAKUT HABITAT: TRADITIONS AND MODERNITY	TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY												Based on the analysis of various ethnographic data and the author's field material, this article examines the use of snow for economic activities and a range of socio-cultural practices of the Yakuts in the mid-19th and 21st centuries. The principles of cryosophy and cryoanthropology, which suggest a positive perception of cold and the cryogenic processes and phenomena that accompany it, served as the methodological basis for the study, as did the increased attention given to the analysis of the role of cryogenic resources in the life of northern communities. We analyzed documents from the collections of the Irkutsk Region State Archives, the Scientific Archives of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the St. Petersburg Branch of the Archives of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Manuscript Fund of the Archives of the Yakut Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, information from scientific literature, and materials collected during the 2017-2023 expedition works in the Amginsky, Olekminsky, Srednekolymsky, Tattinsky, and Khangalassky administrative regions of Yakutia. As a result of the conducted work, it was found that snow is a source of drinking and industrial water, also it serves as a means of insulation of residential and commercial buildings, and cleaning things. Snow has found a wide application in the economic practices of the representatives of the ethnic group: Hunting, fishing, agriculture, livestock and horse breeding, and in making transportation connections. There are also a number of ethnic peculiarities in the use of snow. In particular, the Yakuts did not use snow to construct their houses. At the same time, the nature of settlement by the representatives of the ethnic group and their preference for lakes led to the emergence of a number of unique traditional winter practices based on the use of snow. It should be noted that over time, with socio-economic, cultural, and technological development, snow, as a resource for ensuring the life of the representatives of the Yakut ethnic group, began to lose its position. It is concluded that the current stage, in addition to the preservation of a number of well-known household methods, is characterized by the actualization of the importance of snow in general, cryogenic processes, and phenomena as a resource that forms the tourist potential of Yakutia.

This study aimed to investigate the hydrological response to climate change's impact in the Baro River basin. Four climate models namely, Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2 (HadGEM2-ES), Max Planck Institute Earth System Model-Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR), Coupled Model Version 5, Medium Resolution (CM5A-MR) and European Community Earth System Model (EC-Earth) dynamically downscaled outputs were obtained from Africa coordinated regional downscaling experiment program. The four climate models were evaluated using a suite of statistical measures such as bias, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation. The bias of the simulated rainfall varies between - 4.20% and - 25.39% suggesting underestimation. The performance of the models differs subject to the performance measures used for evaluation. Before being used in the climate impact analysis, the climate model data was heavily skewed and needed correction. In terms of bias, HadGEM2-ES performed the worst while EC-Earth performed the best. MPI-ESM-LR was the worst performer in terms of RMSE and CM5A-MR was the best. Changes in the hydrological response to climate change were compared to the baseline scenario (1971-2000) under the Representative Concentration Pathway Scenarios (RCP 4.5) for the medium term (2041-2070). The GCM predictions for the RCP 4.5 scenarios suggested that, in the medium period (2041-2070) the maximum temperature in the Baro River basin will probably rise by 2.1 degrees C for MPI-ESM-LR and 2.49 degrees C for CM5A-MR, while the minimum temperature would likely climb by 1.7 degrees C to EC-Earth and 2.8 degrees C for HadGEM2-ES. Annual rainfall is expected to fall by 7.02% for CM5A-MR and 17.01% for HadGEM2-ES, while annual evapotranspiration potential is likely to rise. Except from March to May CM5A-MR consistently generated the greatest amount of streamflow change, while MPI-ESM-LR consistently generated the highest magnitude of streamflow change. The annual streamflow reduction is consistent with the annual precipitation reduction and increased annual potential evapotranspiration. Generally, climate change is predicted to have a significant impact on the hydrological response in the Baro River basin under the RCP 4.5 scenario.

J	Savage, TJ				Savage, Thomas J.			Emeline and Jeremiah Strains on a Mormon Forty-Niner Family	CALIFORNIA HISTORY												On November 2, 1850, Jeremiah Root published a "Notice" in the Sacramento Transcript offering a reward for the arrest of his wife, Emeline, who had absconded with a younger man, twelve thousand dollars, and their two-year-old daughter, leaving Root and their five sons to fend for themselves at the roadhouse they ran along the American River. When Emeline and their daughter were found three months later on a bark in San Francisco preparing to leave California, Jeremiah met with her and the couple quickly reconciled. Charges were dropped against Emeline and her associates, and Jeremiah and the rest of their family joined her on the ship to travel east. The Transcript editorialized against the apparent tawdry nature of the affair, but a deeper inspection of the history of this forty-niner family reveals in intimate detail how Jeremiah and Emeline's personal struggles emerged from the incredible physical and spiritual turmoil experienced by early Mormon emigrants, who played a seminal role in Gold Rush era California. Emeline and Jeremiah Root were early converts to Mormonism and arrived in California having survived a twelve-year odyssey that began in Kirtland, Ohio. They were expelled first from Kirtland and then from Nauvoo, Illinois, after the murder of their church leader, Joseph Smith. They persevered through starvation and malnutrition at Winter Quarters on the Missouri River while following Brigham Young to Salt Lake. They struggled with spiritual allegiances as the practice of polygamy and economic inequities became apparent among church leadership, and they ultimately defied Brigham Young by taking the physically demanding overland route from Salt Lake through the Forty-Mile Desert and over the Carson Pass to Gold Rush California in early 1849. Finally, they lived through a tumultuous year on the lower American River, surviving among unruly miners, deadly shootouts over property rights, and a rampant outbreak of cholera. These pressures erupted into a personal crisis when Emeline escaped, escorted by a family friend who was perhaps her lover, taking her only daughter and the family fortune with her. Emeline and Jeremiah's eventual reconciliation and the way Jeremiah ultimately lived out his life revealed them to be people of personal and spiritual integrity who, in this one incident, were overwhelmed by the struggles of the times. Their story illustrates the incredible resiliency of early California pioneers and integrates in vivid detail the physical, spiritual, and emotional challenges facing families in Gold Rush era California.																			0162-2897					SUM	2016	93	2					31	56		10.1525/CH.2016.93.2.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/CH.2016.93.2.31													WOS:000379198000005

Six volcanic sequences were identified with ages ranging from early Miocene to late Pleistocene that include: 1) Copandaro-Tarimbaro Sequence (CoTS) originated during the early Miocene, contains intercalations of basaltic andesite lavas and ignimbrites with a high degree of hydrothermal alteration, 2) The Tarimbaro Sequence (TS), dated at 18.7 Ma, consists of basaltic andesitic lavas and trachyandesites, 3) The Chucandiro Ignimbrite Sequence (ChIS) with ages of 16.88 +/- 0.34, 16.72 +/- 0.24 and 16.88 +/- 0.22, contains three ignimbritic lithofacies forming a plateau perpendicularly tilted to the NE-SW normal faults. Brecciated deposits (lag breccias) occur at the base of the ignimbrites which follow the trace of the Morelia-Acambay fault system (MAFS). These depositsoverlay the 4) the El Caracol sequence (SEC) dated from 13.73 +/- 0.24 Ma to 3.02 +/- 0.03 Ma, that consists of four volcanic units of basalts, andesites, and basaltic andesites. These rocks interbedded with a late Miocene lacustrine unit dated with an index fossil. The lacustrine deposits are overlaid by the 5) Quinceo-Tetillas Sequence (QT): dated at 1.48 +/- 0.016 Ma, that consists of lahars (flows hyperconcentrated flows) and fall deposits covered by products of Quinceo (1.5 +/- 0.14 Ma) and Tetillas (0.4 +/- 0.08 Ma) volcanoes. Finally, the youngest sequence is represented by the 6) Chucandiro cinder cone (CCh): with an age of 0.161 +/- 0.014 Ma of andesitic composition. The structural and geochemical analysis show that the Copandaro-Tarimbaro (SCoT), the Tarimbaro (ST), and the Chucandiro (SICh) ign-imbritic sequences are closely associated with a transition event between the volcanism of the SMO and the TMVB. Based on the geometry of the Chucandiro Graben, the location of the lag breccia along. the trace of the master faults, the NE-SW direction of secondary faults and the distribu-tion of the ignimbrites, it is proposed that this sequence was originated in the Early Miocene from a graben-type caldera named Chucandiro. Its origin is related to the extensional tectonic setting of the MAFS. In this contribution is reported the onset of the trastension in this central sector of the TMVB during the early Miocene with ages older than 17.1 Ma. Our results indicate that the onset of TMVB in the area occurred dur-ing late Miocene with the emplacement of monogenetic volcanism inside the graben followed by lacustrine sedimentation that continues nowadays.																			1026-8774	2007-2902				APR	2022	39	1					100	115		10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2022.1.111689	http://dx.doi.org/10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2022.1.111689													WOS:000782903300008

The River Kennet is mainly groundwater-fed from a Cretaceous chalk aquifer and hence the river water is calcium- and bicarbonate-bearing and has a relatively constant composition of many major water quality determinands. In-stream biological activity gives rise to marked diurnal fluctuations in pH (of approx. 0.8 units). Dissolved carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen also show marked diurnal fluctuations. Dissolved carbon dioxide varies from approximately 10 to 70 times atmospheric pressure, indicating net release of carbon dioxide and the dominance of heterotrophic (respiratory) processes over autotrophic processes (photosynthesis). Much of the excess carbon dioxide is probably associated with carbon dioxide laden groundwater inputs and the relatively short within-stream residence times ensures only limited degassing to the atmosphere. Diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen vary from approximately 20% to 200% saturation. For both dissolved carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen, the amplitude of fluctuations is much lower during the winter period, when biological activity is at its lowest. The concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP) and boron increase markedly just downstream of the sewage works as a result of this paint source input. These concentrations slowly decline further downstream as additional groundwater inputs dilute the effluent further. The introduction of chemical treatment of sewage effluent for phosphorus reduction at Marlborough STW resulted in a marked decrease in within-river SRP and TP concentrations to levels approximately the same as those upstream of the STW. A comparison of SRP and boron concentrations reveals a reduction in in-stream SRP concentrations by approximately 75% following effluent treatment. In terms of within-river processes controlling in-stream phosphorus concentrations, previous studies have indicated that one potentially important mechanism within calcium bicarbonate bearing rivers may be related to co-precipitation of phosphorus with calcium carbonate (calcite). The present study shows that the waters are oversaturated with respect to calcium carbonate, that no equilibrium conditions exist and that phosphorus removal has led to undetectable changes in calcium carbonate oversaturation. Hence, it is concluded that the primary changes in phosphorus levels within the river is directly associated with changing point source contributions from the STW and physical dilution within the river. However (1) the results relate to only the first year of study and subsequent differences may become apparent and (2) reactions between the water column and plant and bottom sediment interfaces may be important in regulating phosphorus fluxes within the river. The results presented in this paper mark a pilot phase of a longer-term initiative and this paper provides a background setting. The paper discusses the longer-term objectives and important gaps in knowledge of the system that requires further address. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

C	Radulescu, V			ASME	Radulescu, Victorita			AUTONOMOUS PLATFORM COLLECTING THE VEGETATION IN EXCESS FROM NATURAL RESERVATIONS LAKES USED AS A FUTURE BIOMASS RESOURCE	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2017 VOL 14					ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	NOV 03-09, 2017	Tampa, FL	ASME				In Romania, near the Black Sea are two Natural Reservations lakes with salt water, Techirghiol, and Mangalia nowadays confronted with new environmental issues. Lake never freezes. Under these conditions, there are always birds in . transit or in wintering; some of them protected species as endangered. There are no known or available solutions at present that can be used here, without disturbing the biological balance. This paper presents a prototype, patent pending in Romania, which has achieved significant results in protection of the natural environment. The prototype is an autonomous pilot station, placed on a mobile pontoon, powered by photovoltaic panels. It can collect and partially dry the aquatic vegetation developed in excess due to eutrophication. The harvested vegetation is used as the biomass resource to warm the Research Centre on shore, the greenhouse for the protected plant species and the poultry incubator. The prototype now is implemented in Techirghiol Lake as to diminish the local environmental problems: the massive mass of vegetation, the invasive species that appeared, as the invertebrates, the interference scallops, and the predator fish. Due to the permanent decreasing the number of the specific fish, all bird colonies are affected. The proposed solution is innovative, perfect ecological and energetic independent. The mobile pontoon is commanded from distance. The solar panels ensure the pontoon movement and the supply of the collecting, compacting, and partially drying the vegetation. The detailed functioning of the prototype is further detailed presented. The main advantage of this solution is that the vegetation can be collected during the entire period of vegetation without disturbing the biologic environmental, nests period of construction, laying eggs, rearing birds, etc. A second major advantage is that the extracted vegetation can be consumed immediately and integrally into a biomass power plant. The third advantage of this technology is that the platform is placed on a mobile pontoon energetically independent, entirely automated and with a constant adaptation of the operating parameters in accordance with climatic conditions. This innovative solution is accordance to the Romanian reply for EU Council Directives, UE EUCO 75/13 CO EUR 7 signed in Brussels at 22/05/2013, referring to the promotion of the new solutions based on utilization of renewable technology with environmental effects. The prototype has a multi- and a cross-disciplinary character due to the main components. It represents a powerful applicative research requested and cofinanced by the National Authorities and the private sector, as to solve this problem appeared into these Natural Reservations.					radulescu, victorita/D-2754-2015																978-0-7918-5849-3				2018									UNSP V014T07A002															WOS:000430517800002

Approximately 85 percent of the potable water supplied by SNWA is currently conveyed from the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Facility at Lake Mead to the Las Vegas Valley via Aqueducts A and B. These aqueducts are two parallel large diameter pipelines (2,438 mm [96-inch]) constructed of prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP). A third large diameter (2,286 and 2.438 mm [90 and 96-inch]) water supply aqueduct is being constructed to increase the capacity of SNWA's system. The alignment selected for this new aqueduct requires crossing the existing PCCP aqueducts at two locations. The existing aqueducts were designed for about 1.5 to 3 meters (5 to 10 feet) of earth cover at both crossing locations. Also, neither aqueduct can be taken out of service for more than a few days and that outage may only take place during the winter low demand period. The new pipe (full) would weigh more than 4,470 Kg/lineal meter (3,000 lb/lineal foot) and could cause an undesirable loading condition if placed directly over the existing aqueducts. A crossing configuration that does not pose a significant structural or construction related risk to the performance of the existing aqueducts is required. As part of design activities, several alternatives were considered for crossing over or under the existing aqueducts. They included: Open Cut Undercrossing Tunneled Undercrossing in In-Situ Soils Tunneled Undercrossing in Chemically Hardened Soils Structurally Supported Overcrossing The structurally supported overcrossing was selected because of its lower cost and lower risk characteristics relative to other alternatives. The structurally supported overcrossing consists of a structural support, earth cover fill material, and a welded steel pipe overcrossing The structural support includes a corrugated arch with a reinforced concrete load carrying cap straddling each existing aqueduct. The earth cover includes mounded and compacted native soils filled to a configuration that provides visual and thermal cover over the entire crossing. The welded steel pipe overcrossing includes appropriate air release and blowoff appurtenances. The design concept included provisions for excavating the trench for the new pipe into the compacted soil cover and using a controlled low strength material (CLSM) for pipe zone and bedding. Design development information and sketches depicting the structural support and the Aqueduct C overcrossing are presented.

Assessment of the dynamics of the surface area of the Shatsk Lakes over a long-term period based on remote sensing data in connection with fluctuations in their level (1985-2023)	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY												The purpose of the article was to assess the long-term dynamics of the area of the Shatsk Lakes (Volyn region, Ukraine) and the spread of water blooms on their surface using remote sensing data in connection with fluctuations in the level of these water bodies for the period 1985-2023. Satellite images from the American Landsat-5,7,8 mission and the European Sentinel-2 L2A mission were used. Long-term data from state monitoring were also used to monitor: a) water level at the hydrological station of Svitiaz Lake; b) the amount of precipitation at the Svitiaz weather station. It was established that the area of the Shatsk Lakes (Svitiaz, Liutsymer, Chorne Velyke) over the long study period, obtained using satellite images using the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), ranged as follows as a percentage of the average annual values of the lake's surface: Svitiaz - 85-101 %; Liutsymer - 85-100 %; Chorne Velyke - 79-100 %. The area of water bloom in these lakes over the long study period, obtained using satellite images using the NDTI (Normalized Difference Turbidity Index), ranged as follows as a percentage of the average annual values of lake's surface: Svitiaz - 0.04-4.43 %; Liutsymer - 0.2-7.9 %; Chorne Velyke - 0.1-11.9 %. Among the studied lakes, minimal water bloom was observed in the largest among them, Svitiaz, which indicates its better ecological condition. The maximum bloom of water was typical for the small Chorne Velyke Lake. Variations in the area of lakes, water levels and the amount of precipitation are interconnected, which was confirmed by the example of Svitiaz Lake. The resulting pair correlation coefficients (r) between these characteristics are 0.6-0.7. In 2023, the area of Svitiaz Lake was the largest in the last 10 years, as the water level in the lake was also the highest in a decade, which is mainly due to good winter snow reserves. The use of remote sensing techniques to study the morphometric parameters of lakes can provide valuable results for identifying environmental problems. An in-depth study of these problems can take place in nature using instrumental methods, water sampling and analysis.

J	Noe-Nygaard, N; Heiberg, EO				Noe-Nygaard, N; Heiberg, EO			Lake-level changes in the Late Weichselian Lake Tovelde, Mon, Denmark: induced by changes in climate and base level	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The lacustrine Tovelde basin is a key locality for the study of Late Weichselian sedimentological, geochemical and climatic development in Denmark. It is situated on the south coast of the island of Mon 2.5-7.5 ra above present day sea-level. The sediment record covers a time span from about 14,700 to 9000 cal yr BP and starts with resedimented till. Onset of climate amelioration and environmental stability is reflected by onset of lacustrine deposition of increasingly more organic-rich deposits at 14,300 cal yr BP following the deglaciation of the Young Baltic readvance. The lacustrine succession was deposited during overall lake-level rise interrupted by four short-lived falls. During Younger Dryas time, Greenland stadial-1 (event zone GS-1) lake-level rise resulted in the merging of several smaller lakes into one large lake. The early part of the Younger Dryas was characterized by a cold and dry climate and low precipitation, that did not favour the melting of stagnant or active ice. The marked Younger Dryas lake-level rise was probably driven by a rise in base- and ground-water level in the Baltic Basin caused by damming of the Baltic Ice Lake. This was followed by a significant water level rise in the southern Baltic basin during which the Faxe Bugt transgression occurred at around 10,600 C-14 yr BP. The expanded Younger Dryas Lake Tovelde came to an end around 10,000 C-14 yr BP at the transition into the early Preboreal when the Baltic Ice Lake underwent a catastrophic tapping, event. A renewed lake level rise took place after 9600 C-14 yr BP in Preboreal time and continued into the Boreal when a drastic lowering of Lake Tovelde level took place. The resulting forced regression transformed the large lake into smaller lakes and a marker horizon with macrophyte debris, gastropods, bivalves and small vertebrates was formed by redeposition of lake-margin sediments. The lacustrine deposits of Lake Tovelde contains abundant Late Glacial freshwater and terrestrial microvertebrates and molluscs. The low water levels in the Lake Tovelde and in the Baltic Basin were contemporaneous resulting in the formation of land bridges between Sweden, Germany and Denmark, including the island of Bornholm. Such land bridges were established on three occasions allowing immigration of terrestrial microvertebrates to Denmark from the east and partly from the south as reflected in species composition, density and diversity in the Tovelde succession. Sedimentological, geochemical and palaeoecological data show that Lake Tovelde underwent significant fluctuations. Some of which can be directly linked to climate changes. Some rises correlate, however, with damming of the Baltic Basin caused by isostatic uplift of barriers. High-resolution stratigraphy may thus allow distinction between lake-level changes caused by climate fluctuations and base-level changes which are ultimately related to isostasy.

Quality of drinking water and risk to the health of the population of the south Baikal region (Russia)	EMERGING CONTAMINANTS												Providing good quality water in sufficient quantities is a major challenge in the world. The purpose of the study is to assess the quality of drinking water and the health risk of various population groups in the southern Baikal region (Siberia, Russia) under changing hydrological conditions. Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater body of water and is one of the sites protected by UNESCO. Materials and methods. An analysis of centralized and non-centralized water supply was carried out in the south-eastern part of the Irkutsk region, adjacent to Lake Baikal. The data used are from the Baikal (regional) Information Center for 2011-2022, and they include the results of monitoring the water quality of the centralized domestic and drinking water supply (CDW) with 140 thousand samples, and non-centralized domestic and drinking water supply (NDW) with 108 thousand samples. In all samples, 17 substances were determined. In addition, during the flood period, accompanied by additional water disinfection, trihalomethanes were determined in populated areas exposed to negative impacts. The quality of drinking water was assessed in comparison with the maximum permissible concentrations of substances (MPCs) approved by regulatory documents of Russia. An assessment of the characteristics of drinking water consumption by the population of the Baikal region was carried out, based on interview data from sample groups of the population. The assessment of the risk to public health, due to chronic oral intake of chemicals, was carried out using the values of the hazard coefficient (HQi), the hazard index (HI), individual carcinogenic risk (ICR), and population carcinogenic risk (PCR). Village residents more often use underground water sources (centralized and non-centralized). Residents of cities are provided with water from surface sources (Lake Baikal and the Angara River). Significant concentrations of iron, nitrates, and manganese were found in drinking water used by villagers. Average concentrations of iron - 2.25 mg/dl, manganese - 0.6 mg/dl, nitrates -135 mg/dl were recorded in the water of underground springs in villages of the Irkutsk region. Among rural residents of the Irkutsk region, 60.8 % live in settlements with non-water supply systems, 28.4 % have mixed water supply.The non-carcinogenic risk for the adult and child population was calculated; HI > 1 was identified for the population using underground water sources. the non-carcinogenic hazard for the adult population, it was found that HI in the Irkutsk region slightly exceeded the standard value (1), amounting to 1.3, and for the child population - 1.6, the main contribution to the hazard index is represented by nitrates. For children of individual rural settlements of the Angarsk region HI = 1.38. The carcinogenic risk for water from underground sources reached in the range 1.56 x 10(-5)- 2.1 x 10(-4) (in some settlements). Priority carcinogens were identified: arsenic (the contribution of which is 56.3-100 %), hexavalent chromium (29.9-35.8 %). A carcinogenic risk for city residents arises from increased disinfection during periods of microbiological contamination (floods, rains, high water levels), and it is associated with the formation of halogen-containing compounds. Conclusion: The need to strengthen the drinking water quality monitoring system in risk areas has been proven by increasing the number and frequency of sampling during flood periods.

J	Kant, S				Kant, Shashi			Modeling the interaction of birds and small fish in a coastal lagoon	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCES AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												Coastal lagoons are high value productive and important systems for different projects. For example, aquaculture, fisheries and tourism are few of them. The quality of coastal waters in the ecosystems of lagoons can be greatly influenced by the growth of unwanted elements, e.g., excessive fisheries, tourism, etc. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed and analysed to study the general and simplified form of an ecosystem of Chilika Lake, India. Chilika Lake (19 degrees 28'N-19 degrees 54'N and 85 degrees 06'E-85 degrees 36'E) is the largest wintering ground for migrating water fowl found anywhere on the Indian sub-continent. These migratory birds utilize the Chilika Lake for feeding, resting and breeding. The interaction of birds and small fish in the Chilika Lake is considered to be Leslie-Gower Holling type II. Since big fish are being sourced as income for local fishermen and the population of big fish is highly variable, and hence birds and small fishes are mainly the two types of biomass considered for this study. It must be noted that, in this study, we have considered the case of Chilika lake theoretically only and no practical data is collected for this study, and the name of Chilika is used only for better ecological understanding. Therefore, this theoretical study maybe linked to any such ecosystem. Their interaction is found mathematically, a two-dimensional continuous-time dynamical system modeling a simple predator-prey food chain. The dynamical system is represented in the form of two nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems. The main mathematical results are given in terms of boundedness of solutions, existence of equilibria, local and global stability of the coexisting interior point. An ecosystem in Indian coastal lagoons may suffer immediate environmental perturbations, such as depressions, tropical cyclones, earthquakes, epidemics, etc. To model such situations, the ODE model is further extended to a stochastic model driven by Levy noise. The stochastic analysis includes the existence of the unique global solution, stability in mean, and extinction of the population. The proposed model is numerically simulated with the help of an assumed set of parameters for the possible pictorial behavior of the theoretical model. The proposed model may be used for planning purposes by using the data on meteorological and weather shocks such as heavy rainfall, heat-waves, cold-waves, depressions, tropical cyclones, earthquakes, etc. from India Meteorological Department (IMD).						kant, shashi/0000-0002-1235-8734													1565-1339	2191-0294				FEB 26	2022	23	2					215	240		10.1515/ijnsns-2018-0084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijnsns-2018-0084		JUL 2021											WOS:000738254200001

Magmatic evolution and architecture of an arc-related, rhyolitic caldera complex: The late Pleistocene to Holocene Cerro Blanco volcanic complex, southern Puna, Argentina	GEOSPHERE												Through the lens of bulk-rock and matrix glass geochemistry, we investigated the magmatic evolution and pre-eruptive architecture of the siliceous magma complex beneath the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex, a Crater Lake-type caldera complex in the southern Puna Plateau of the Central Andes of Argentina. The Cerro Blanco volcanic complex has been the site of two caldera-forming eruptions with volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 6+ that emplaced the ca. 54 ka Campo Piedra Pomez ignimbrite and the ca. 4.2 ka Cerro Blanco ignimbrite. As such, it is the most productive recent explosive volcano in the Central Andes.The most recent eruptions (younger than 4.2 ka) are dominantly postcaldera effusions of crystal-rich domes and associated small explosive pulses. Previous work has demonstrated that andesitic recharge of and mixing with rhyolitic magma occurred at the base of the magma complex, at similar to 10 km depth. New isotopic data (Sr, Nd, Pb, and O) confirm that the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex rhyolite suite is part of a regional southern Puna, arc-related ignimbrite group. The suite defines a tight group of consanguineous siliceous magmas that serves as a model for the evolution of arc-related, caldera-forming silicic magma systems in the region and elsewhere. These data indicate that the rhyolites originated through limited assimilation of and mixing with upper-crustal lithologies by regional basaltic andesite parent materials, followed by extensive fractional crystallization. Least squares models of major elements in tandem with Rayleigh fractionation models for trace elements reveal that the internal variations among the rhyolites through time can be derived by extensive fractionation of a quartz-two feldspar (granitic minimum) assemblage with limited assimilation. The rare earth element character of local volumes of melt in some samples of the Campo Piedra Pomez ignimbrite basal fallout requires significant fractionation of amphibole.The distinctive major- and trace-element characteristics of bulk rock and matrix of the Campo Piedra Pomez and Cerro Blanco tephras provide useful geochemical fingerprints to facilitate regional tephrochronology. Available data indicate that rhyolites from other neighborhood centers, such as Cueros de Purulla, share bulk chemical characteristics with the Campo Piedra Pomez ignimbrite rhyolites, but they appear to be isotopically distinct. Pre-eruptive storage and final equilibration of the rhyolitic melts were estimated from matrix glass compositions projected onto the haplogranitic system (quartz-albite-orthoclase-H2O) and using rhyolite-MELTS models. These revealed equilibration pressures between 360 and 60 MPa (similar to 10-2 km depth) with lowest pressures in the Holocene eruptions. Model temperatures for the suite ranged from 695 to 790 degrees C. Integrated together, our results reveal that the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex is a steady-state (low-magmatic-flux), arc-related complex, standing in contrast to the flare-up (high-magmatic-flux) supervolcanoes that dominate the Neogene volcanic stratigraphy. The silicic magmas of the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex were derived more directly from mafic and intermediate precursors through extensive fractional crystallization, albeit with some mixing and assimilation of local basement. Geochemical models and pressure-temperature estimates indicate that significant volumes of remnant cumulates of felsic and intermediate composition should dominate the polybaric magma complex beneath the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex, which gradually shallowed through time. Evolution to the most silicic compositions and final equilibration of some of the postcaldera domes occurred during ascent and decompression at depths less than 2 km. Our work connotes an incrementally accumulated (over at least 54 k.y.), upper-crustal pluton beneath the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex between 2 and 10 km depth.The composition of this pluton is predicted to be dominantly granitic, with deeper parts being granodioritic to tonalitic. The progressive solidification and eventual contraction of the magma complex may account for the decades of deflation that has characterized Cerro Blanco.The presently active geothermal anomaly and hydrothermal springs indicate the Cerro Blanco volcanic complex remains potentially active.					; de Silva, Shanaka/A-4630-2011	BECCHIO, RAUL/0000-0002-7839-2097; de Silva, Shanaka/0000-0002-0310-5516													1553-040X					APR	2022	18	2					394	423		10.1130/GES02294.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02294.1		JAN 2022											WOS:000747976400001

Great habitat heterogeneity characterizes the littoral ecosystems, often encompassing macrophyte covered areas that provide microhabitats with diverse structural complexity, and several effects over the structure and function of biological communities. The effects of macrophytes on trophic interactions are more complex in subtropical lakes than in temperate lakes. The relationships between planktonic food web components and the effects of a highly dynamic environment in structuring plankton communities were studied in a large subtropical shallow lake. The study was conducted for twenty-five consecutive days in the summer of 2016 at two sites (Station 1 and Station 2) in the well-developed littoral zone of Lake Mangueira hosting different plant life forms. Strong spatial variation between sampling stations was evidenced in the density of most of the communities, with the highest means of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and ciliates density being recorded at the station surrounded mainly by submerged macrophytes (Station 1). These plants particularly modify microhabitat complexity by increasing the availability and functional diversity of niches. Furthermore, submerged macrophytes tend to accumulate more periphyton biomass, a quality food resource for many consumers. Important grazing relationships, nutrient demands, and trophic structure were assessed through carbon biomass of the communities. Phytoplankton accounted for a greater proportion of the entire plankton community than bacteria, while zooplankton had low carbon biomass of crustaceans and a high dominance of ciliates and rotifers, with a greater grazing impact on bacterioplankton than on phytoplankton. According to RDA and multiple-regression analysis, nutrients and humic substances were the main predictors of variability in the littoral food web components over a short-sampling interval. The carbon biomass of bacteria and metazooplankton were both positively related to humic substances and nutrients at Station 1, as well as the biomass ratio of metazooplankton to phytoplankton and metazooplankton to ciliates. This suggests that humic substances have been metabolized by bacteria and transferred to higher trophic levels through predation. On the other hand, humic substances negatively affected the carbon biomass of bacteria and cyanobacteria at Station 2, suggesting a mostly refractory DOC around the emergent plants. Results indicate that despite the greater importance of bacterial biomass in the energy transfer through zooplankton predation, the efficiency of carbon transfer in algal and bacteria-based food webs was both very low. The effects of macrophytes on the quantity and/or quality of nutrients and substrates for bacteria uptake and phytoplankton requirements, explained the spatial variability of plankton food web components, even over the short distance between stations, as well as the inefficient microbial loop found in the littoral zone inhabited by macrophytes.

Major flood control projects on this waterway include an early 1900's diversion of the creek at its confluence with the Kansas River through the construction of a tunnel. Providing a relatively flat corridor in an area of rolling hills, the Turkey Creek floodplain in the southwest region of Kansas City has been a target of transportation related development since the 1800's. The stream corridor includes a rail, highway and interstate system. Many changes have occurred to the stream system over time that have resulted in environmental degradation. These changes include floodplain filling, channel straightening, concrete lining, channel enclosures, filling in of on-stream lakes, and disruptions due to numerous road and utility crossings. Based on a U.S. House of Representatives resolution adopted February 2000, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reconnaissance Study was authorized to evaluate the federal interest in solutions to recurring flood damages, environmental degradation and related water and land resource needs and opportunities. An expedited Reconnaissance Study was completed in July 2001. It recommended a number of different strategies to restore this urban stream and reduce flood damages. The environmental strategies included methods to stop stream downcutting, removing blockages to fish passage, retrofitting basins and swales for water quality benefits, acquiring remaining areas of open space, removing channel linings, reconnecting the floodplain and channel, emphasizing stormwater storage and infiltration systems over stormwater and floodwater conveyance systems, and implementing public information/awareness campaigns. The environmental strategies were complimented by flood damage reduction strategies that emphasized detention, relocations, flood proofing, and flood warning systems, in addition to structural flood protection. A Project Management Plan was prepared and the sponsors signed an agreement to proceed in June 2002. Local agencies are focused on developing a basin-wide multi-jurisdictional approach in this approximately 90% urbanized watershed. Baseline information is currently being prepared for an expected summer 2003 Feasibility Scoping Meeting. The Feasibility Study will identify a multi-purpose plan for flood damage reduction and environmental enhancement in the Turkey Creek watershed considering both existing and future conditions. The project integrates biological and water quality data prepared for a use attainability analysis with engineering principles and hydrologic and hydraulic models to develop an urban stream restoration plan to return wildlife to and increase public appreciation of the Turkey Creek corridor.																					0-7844-0695-2				2004							83	90																WOS:000222180700008
J	HOFMANN, F				HOFMANN, F			QUARTERNARY GEOLOGY IN THE KLETTGAU-REGION (KT SCHAFFHAUSEN, SWITZERLAND)	ECLOGAE GEOLOGICAE HELVETIAE												In the present paper, insights into the quarternary deposits of the Klettgau Valley (west of Schaffhausen, Switzerland) are described and discussed, which were made possible by temporary building excavation outcrops and gravel pits accessible over the past years. The Klettgau region is located outside of the maximum extension limit of the last (Worm) glaciation. In particular, at many places prewurmian (''Riss'') moraines and gravels were found which were deposited by the Linth and not by the Rhine glacier. This can be proved by the presence of unequivocal pebbles from the Glarus Alps (violet spilites, volcanoclastic Taveyannaz sandstones and a wide variety of Verrucano rocks typical for the Glarus area). The Linth glacier, which arrived from the south first, supplied pebbles through preexisting lateral valleys into the Klettgau canyon which at that time was still being filled up from the east by gravels originating from the Rhine glacier moving on from the Lake of Constance region. Later on the ice moved into the Klettgau Valley. which at that time was dammed up by the Aare glacier, having arrived at the foot of the Black Forest near Waldshut. The Klettgau Valley was converted into a lake some 25 km long, in which clay and silt mud and sands were deposited as well as moraine material from the Linth glacier moving into the lake area. Isolated boulders of alpine rocks which are found within the mud sediments must be attributed to transportation by drifting ice. Most probably, the Linth glacier moved across the Klettgau Valley as far as Hallau, but it remains uncertain whether it reached the Wutach area (Schleitheim) at the same occasion. The moraines found in that region could have been deposited during an earlier glaciation. The observations presented also allow some reflections on the causes and on the mechanism of the deviation of the Rhine from Schaffhausen to the south. Not only the Klettgau Valley gravels, but also those of the region downstream from the Rhine Falls consist of a mixture of pebbles from the eastern Rhine glacier and from the southern Linth glacier. Their deposition must have started whilst the ice of the two glacier systems moved onto the Schaffhausen area. For a considerable period of time, alternative or simultaneous supply of gravel from both systems must have taken place into both areas, west or south of Schaffhausen respectively. Preexistent canyons in the Jurassic rock basement must have played an important role, and the previous history of the deviation of the Rhine gets a new dimension. Only after the maximum extension of the pre-Wurm glaciation, the Rhine was definitely deviated southwards.																			0012-9402						1994	87	1					241	263																WOS:A1994NP89600011
J	Symonds, RB; Gerlach, TM; Reed, MH				Symonds, RB; Gerlach, TM; Reed, MH			Magmatic gas scrubbing: implications for volcano monitoring	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					IAVCEI General Assembly, Symposium 4 on Volcanic Gases	JAN 19-24, 1997	PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO					Despite the abundance Of SO2(g) in magmatic gases, precursory increases in magmatic SO2(g) are not always observed prior to volcanic eruption, probably because many terrestrial volcanoes contain abundant groundwater or surface water that scrubs magmatic gases until a dry pathway to the atmosphere is established. To better understand scrubbing and its implications for volcano monitoring, we model thermochemically the reaction of magmatic gases with water. First, we inject a 915 degreesC magmatic gas from Merapi volcano into 25 degreesC air-saturated water (ASW) over a wide range of gas/water mass ratios from 0.0002 to 100 and at a total pressure of 0.1 MPa. Then we model closed-system cooling of the magmatic gas, magmatic gas-ASW mixing at 5.0 MPa, runs with varied temperature and composition of the ASW, a case with a wide range of magmatic-gas compositions, and a reaction of a magmatic gas-ASW mixture with rock. The modeling predicts gas and water compositions, and, in one case, alteration assemblages for a wide range of scrubbing conditions; these results can be compared directly with samples from degassing volcanoes. The modeling suggests that CO2(g) is the main species to monitor when scrubbing exists; another candidate is HS(g), but it can be affected by reactions with aqueous ferrous iron. In contrast, scrubbing by water will prevent significant SO2(g) and most HCl(g) emissions until dry pathways are established, except for moderate HCl(g) degassing from pH < 0.5 hydrothermal waters. Furthermore, it appears that scrubbing will prevent much, if any, SO2(g) degassing from long-resident boiling hydrothermal systems. Several processes can also decrease or increase H-2(g) emissions during scrubbing making H-2(g) a poor choice to detect changes in magma degassing. We applied the model results to interpret field observations and emission rate data from four eruptions: (1) Crater Peak on Mount Spurr (1992) where, except for a short post-eruptive period, scrubbing appears to have drastically diminished pre-, inter-, and post-eruptive SO2(g) emissions, but had much less impact on CO2(g) emissions. (2) Mount St. Helens where scrubbing Of SO2(g) was important prior to and three weeks after the 18 May 1980 eruption. Scrubbing was also active during a period of unrest in the summer of 1998. (3) Mount Pinatubo where early drying out prevented SO2(g) scrubbing before the climactic 15 June 1991 eruption. (4) The ongoing eruption at Popocatepetl in an and region of Mexico where there is little evidence of scrubbing. In most eruptive cycles, the impact of scrubbing will be greater during pre- and post-eruptive periods than during the main eruptive and intense passive degassing stages. Therefore, we recommend monitoring the following gases: CO2(g) and H2S(g) in precursory stages; CO2(g), H2S(g), SO2(g), HCl(g), and HF(g) in eruptive and intense passive degassing stages; and CO2(g) and H2S(g) again in the declining stages. CO2(g) is clearly the main candidate for early emission rate monitoring, although significant early increases in the intensity and geographic distribution of H2S(g) emissions should be taken as an important sign of volcanic unrest and a potential precursor. Owing to the difficulty of extracting SO2(g) from hydrothermal waters, the emergence of > 100 t/d (tons per day) of SO2(g) in addition to CO2(g) and H2S(g) should be taken as a criterion of magma intrusion. Finally, the modeling suggests that the interpretation of gas-ratio data requires a case-by-case evaluation since ratio changes can often be produced by several mechanisms; nevertheless, several gas ratios may provide useful indices for monitoring the drying out of gas pathways.

The results indicate that the magnetic minerals in these sediments are primarily composed of Pseudo-Single-Domain (PSD) magnetite and Single-Domain (SD) greigite. The paleo-deep lake deposits (A) represent sedimentation occurring before 51.82 f 2.34 ka, while paleo-deep lake deposits (B) formed between 39.18 f 2.03 and 36.77 f 1.66 ka. Higher values of chi, SIRM, chi ARM/chi, and chi ARM/SIRM indicate predominance of fine-grained magnetic minerals due to strong weathering in the watershed, suggesting a warm and humid climate with increased precipitation and meltwater. The paleo-shallow lake deposits (A) formed between 51.01 f 2.19 and 39.54 f 1.72 ka. Lower values of chi, chi ARM, SIRM, chi ARM/chi, and chi ARM/SIRM indicating dry and cold conditions that led to coarse-grained sediments with minimal weathering. The paleo-shallow lake deposits (B), formed between 36.73 f 2.04 ka and 31.44 f 1.97 ka, show increased hard magnetic minerals, reflecting enhanced Yellow River input of coarse sediments. Under the dual influence of a warm and humid climate and the neotectonics of the East Kunlun Fault, headward erosion of Yellow River has intensified, triggering a decline in paleo-lake water level. High magnetic minerals contents of two overbank flood deposits (OFD) suggest warm-climate weathering, while low chi ARM/chi and chi ARM/SIRM values indicate strong hydrodynamic conditions. The intensification of the East Asian Summer Monsoon and glacial melting initiated OFD1, which occurred between 30.43 f 3.76 ka and 27.47 f 3.57 ka, corresponding to MIS 3a period. OFD2 occurred between 15.30 f 1.04 ka and 12.93 f 1.63 ka, coinciding with the B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d event. At these two periods, the water was mainly derived from the accelerated melting of mountain glaciers surrounding the basin and/or the large-scale precipitation, which led to the overbank floods. The research findings enhance the application of environmental magnetism in the study of river terrace sedimentary sequences.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2025	257								109161	10.1016/j.catena.2025.109161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2025.109161													WOS:001500061500001
J	SAEMUNDSSON, K				SAEMUNDSSON, K			GEOLOGY OF THE THINGVALLAVATN AREA	OIKOS												Thingvallavatn occupies a NE-SW elongated graben within the western branch of the axial rift zone in SW-Iceland. The topography of the graben floor slopes off from the Langjokull ice cap and Skjaldbreidur lava shield of over 1000 m altitude in the NE to below sea level in the southwestern part of the lake. The bedrock of the catchment consists of 1) Postglacial lavas that are most extensive in the central part of the graben. 2) Upper Pleistocene pillow lava and hyaloclastite of subglacial origin and subaerial inter- or supraglacial lava. These are most extensive at the periphery of the graben. 3) A small sliver on the western margin belongs to the Plio-Pleistocene series. Virtually all the rocks are basaltic. The lake basin is closed towards SW by Upper Pleistocene volcanic complexes of progressively younger age towards the west. Eruptions in the lake basin are confined to the northern extremity of these. The volcanic production diminishes rather abruptly towards the lake where it far from matches the rate of subsidence. The morphology and structure of the lake surroundings are very strongly dominated by faults with throws of locally more than 100 m towards the actively sinking and expanding graben. The graben floor shows signs of a southeastward tilt. This is particularly clear along the western margin. The present lake began to form at the end of the last glaciation as an ice-dammed frontal lake. During and immediately after ice recession, the lake may have been turbid with glacial meltwater flowing into it. This situation changed in the earliest Postglacial as the Eldborgir and Skjaldbreidur lava shields formed across the central part of the catchment providing a barrier to surface inflow and an effective filtering of the glacial waters. As a result, the lake area was greatly reduced and the drainage from the main part of the catchment seeped into the lavas to emerge as springs at the shores of the lake. Smaller lavas have been erupted by crater rows SW of the lake, the youngest, Nesjahraun, about 2000 years ago. At the same time the phreatic tuff cone of Sandey was formed in the middle of the lake. Ash from this eruption was blown towards east and has a thickness of at least 40 cm on the nearest eastern shore, and thus must form a layer of considerable thickness on the lake bottom. After the postglacial lava shields were formed more than 9000 years ago the lake has been constantly gaining in area, mainly towards the NE by stepwise and latent subsidence of the graben floor. The total amount of subsidence during this period is more than 40 m between Almannagja and Hrafnagja. The horizontal extension of the graben over the same 9000 year interval has been estimated at about 70 m. The last tectonic event to hit the area occurred in 1789 when the Hengill volcanic system split up along its > 60 km long fissure swarm. Geological evidence indicates that subsidence along the northern shore of Thingvallavatn during this event was of the order of 1-2.6 m.																			0030-1299					MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					40	68		10.2307/3545042	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545042													WOS:A1992JG50900005

Among these, the widespread calcifying green alga Phacotus lenticularis (Ehrenberg) Diesing contributes to biogenic calcite precipitation in temperate regions. Its role in carbonate precipitation needs to be investigated, because there are no studies dedicated to the quantitative contribution of Phacotus shells to long term carbonate sequestration in hard-water lake sediments. In order to fill this gap, the Phacotus shell content in the sediments of four German hard-water lakes was determined and compared to the fraction of Phacotus shells in the total suspended autochthonous calcite of the euphotic zone. It was found that the Phacotus shells contributed at least 10% to the autochthonous carbonate precipitation in the upper water column in three investigated lakes. During a Phacotus mass occurrence with a cell density of 1.8 x 10(6) Ind L-1 in Lake llopfensee, even 59% of the 3.6 mg L-1 total carbonate concentration consisted of Phacotus shells. In contrast to this high amount, the topmost basinal sediment contained a Phacotus shell content between 80 and 36,252 individuals per mg dry sediment, representing only 0.02% to 2.28% of the total carbonate sediment content. In a gravity core from Lake Grosser Ostersee, dating back similar to 150 years, the Phacotus shell content was continuously below 0.24% whereas the shell diameters remained equal to those of living individuals found in the water column proving that Phacotus shells are capable to persist in the sediment after deposition. A main reason for the large discrepancy between Phacotus shell abundance in the euphotic zone and in sediment was found to be the gross authigenic carbonate precipitation, which dilutes the sedimenting Phacotus shells that accumulate exclusively during short and intensive population peaks in summer. Additionally, dissolution of the carbonate shells during sedimentation was proven to be a relevant factor in Lake Igelsbachsee by means of reducing the number of Phacotus shells reaching the lake bottom. These facts explain that short-term high Phacotus carbonate contents of the total suspended carbonate in the water column do not mirror the contribution of Phacotus shells in the sedimentary record.

C	Haber, LC; Smith, J			ASME	Haber, Ludwig C.; Smith, James			AIR INGESTION AND TRANSPORT TESTING IN A ROTATING DRUM RAW WATER STRAINER	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND THE ASME 2012 POWER CONFERENCE - 2012, VOL 1					20th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering and the ASME 2012 Power Conference (ICONE20-POWER2012)	JUL 30-AUG 03, 2012	Anaheim, CA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Nucl Engn Div, Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Chinese Nucl Soc, Int Atom Energy Agcy, Canadian Nucl Soc, European Nucl Soc, Soc Nucl Mexicana, Nucl Soc Slovenia, Atom Energy Soc Japan, Austrian Nucl Soc, Canadian Standard Assoc				McGuire Nuclear Station (MNS) is performing ongoing work upgrading components and systems in their raw water supply (RN) system. The RN system supplies the cooling water for residual heat removal and represents the assured source of heat removal during emergency shut-down. At MNS, the main source of cooling water is Lake Norman but an additional ultimate heat sink pond, the Standby Nuclear Service Water Pond (SNSWP) represents the assured source of cooling water during an accident which has Lake Norman unavailable as a source for cooling water. When the RN system shifts suction from Lake Norman to the SNWP, the suction piping becomes nearly a half mile long and the inlet pressure to the strainer, which is installed on the suction side of the RN pump drops to vacuum conditions, depending on flow rate. The RN strainer is a rotating drum strainer, spinning at a constant 4.5 RPM. The motor and gear-box connection for the spinning filter element is at the top of the strainer, sealed by four rings of packing. Over time, the packing seals can wear and allow water to leak out through the packing since the strainer operates at about 10 psig (positive) under normal operating conditions. Under vacuum conditions, the water leakage out of the drum will stop and air ingestion into the drum will begin. A wide range of strainer and backwash system performance tests was conducted during the summer of 2011 at Alden Laboratory using a full-size raw water strainer taken out of service from MNS. Part of these tests concerned a quantitative determination of the rate of strainer air ingestion and an assessment as to the path of transport (if any) for the ingested air. Testing revealed that a sizeable air bubble forms on the interior side of the drum strainer, downstream of the filter elements. The air bubble appeared stable in testing under constant operating conditions and was largest at low system flow rates. When the test flow rate of the system was increased, the new stable, lower bubble volume was achieved quickly and the difference in bubble volume was transported downstream quickly. Such sudden transport of air has the potential to impact pump performance. However, a review of the plant system and operation reveals that the transient responsible for the sudden transport of air downstream is not possible. Nevertheless, the understanding gained from testing regarding the transport and accumulation dynamics of the ingested air has been helpful in better understanding what the likely impacts of air ingestion are on system performance.																					978-0-7918-4495-3				2012							263	268																WOS:000324149200032
J	Risacher, F; Fritz, B				Risacher, F; Fritz, B			Bromine geochemistry of salar de Uyuni and deeper salt crusts, Central Altiplano, Bolivia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The salar of Uyuni, in the central Bolivian Altiplano, is probably the largest salt pan in the world (10 000 km(2)). A 121 m deep well drilled in the central salar disclosed a complex evaporitic sequence of 12 salt crusts separated by 11 mud layers. In the lower half of the profile, thick halite beds alternate with thin mud layers. The mud layers thicken upwards and show clear lacustrine features. The thickness of the salt beds decreases markedly from the base upward. The bromine content of the halite ranges from 1.3 to 10.4 mg/kg. The halite does not originate from the evaporation of the dilute inflow waters of the Altiplano, which would lead to Br content of tens of mg/kg. The presence of halite of very low Br content (2 mg/kg) in a gypsum diapir strongly suggests that most of the halite deposited at Uyuni originated from the leaching of ancient salt formations associated with the numerous gypsum diapirs of the Altiplano. The deep and thick halite beds were probably deposited in a playa lake, as suggested by their very low and fairly constant Br content (1.6-2.3 mg/kg) and by the abundance of detrital minerals. Thereafter, perennial salt lakes of increasing duration flooded the central Altiplano. Increasing amounts of dilute inflow waters of low Cl-/Br- ratio and the exhaustion of diapiric halite lead to an increase of both the thickness of the lacustrine layers and of the bromine content of the salt crusts (5-10 mg/kg) deposited as the lakes dried up. Paleolake levels in the central Altiplano rose as those in the northern Altiplano (the Titicaca basin) were simultaneously falling. The progressive fluvial erosion of the threshold between the northern and the central Altiplano lowered the levels of the northern lakes and allowed more dilute waters of low Cl-/Br- ratio to flood the central Altiplano. Therefore, both the thickness of lacustrine sediments and the bromine content of the salt crust increased to the present. The three upper crusts show a decrease in bromine content which may reflect a recent modification of the inflow regime to the last lakes. The salt crust deposited by the last salt lake, 10 000 years ago, shows a bromine distribution that unexpectedly increases with depth. As the lake dried, the salt crust was probably initialy distributed over a wider area than the present flat crust, covering the topographic surface up to the level of the lake where halite reached saturation. The dissolution of the initial salt of low Br content front the margins of the lake to the center is probably responsible for the observed Br distribution in the surface salt, as in a playa. During the Holocene, a severe drought hit the Altiplano and drastically lowered the intracrustal brine table within the salt crust, leaving a thin layer of high-concentrated residual brine at the bottom of the crust. Bromine-rich halite replaced primary halite by a temperature-activated mechanism in the lower crust, further increasing the Br gradient with depth. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the temperate climate of Europe, R. raciborskii has been reported in many countries, but there is still a lack of detailed information about the current status of its distribution in lakes of Bulgaria, as a part of the southeastern range of its spread in Europe. We investigated the distribution of the species using data on the phytoplankton of 122 lakes surveyed during 13years period (2009-2022). The species was found in 33 lakes (up to 324 m asl), and 14 new localities were registered during the studied period. The results reveal that the number of lakes with the presence of R. raciborskii (27 % of all research lakes) and its contribution to the total phytoplankton biomass, has increased significantly over the last decade. The species has successfully adapted and dominated the phytoplankton in 9 lakes, forming a bloom in 8 of them. The dominant position of R. raciborskii causes loss of species and functional diversity of phytoplankton and displaces the native bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Lakes with and without the species were compared based on the available data on bioclimatic and local environmental variables. Statistically significant differences were established with respect to water transparency, conductivity, maximum depth and maximum air temperature in the warmest month. Species distribution models (SDMs) were used to identify lakes in high risk of future invasion by R. raciborskii. The results of the SDMs implementation confirmed the high maximum air temperature and low water transparency to be important predictors of the occurrence of R. raciborskii in freshwater lakes in Bulgaria. In the areas with high summer temperatures the most suitable for R. raciborskii development were found to be shallow polymictic or medium deep lakes with small surface area and low water transparency. In areas with a suitable climate, the large, deep reservoirs with high transparency as well as macrophyte dominated lakes have a low probability of occurrence of R. raciborskii. Future colonization of lakes above 500 m asl (but most likely below 700 m asl) is also possible, especially in the conditions of global warming. SDMs account for climatic and biogeographic differences of lakes and could help in elucidating the underlying factors that control the occurrence and adaptation of R. raciborskii in a given area.					; Stoyanov, Plamen/AFU-9474-2022; Belkinova, Detelina/JCE-1296-2023; Kazakov, Stefan/JRW-1182-2023; Stoyanova, Desislava/X-2251-2019; Beshkova, Mihaela/HHR-9128-2022	Stoyanov, Plamen/0000-0002-5631-1444; Stoyanova, Desislava/0000-0001-8040-7158; Beshkova, Mihaela/0000-0001-8259-5260; Belkinova, Detelina/0000-0003-0738-4871													1568-9883	1878-1470				FEB	2024	132								102578	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102578		JAN 2024						38331543					WOS:001172884300001

Geologic setting of the Abdur Archaeological Site on the Red Sea coast of Eritrea, Africa	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The Abdur Archaeological Site was defined initially by the discovery and dating (125 +/- ka by Ur/Th) of in situ stone tools within uplifted marine terrace deposits located along the southern Red Sea coast of Eritrea, near the small village of Abdur. These tools represent some of the earliest well-dated evidence for human occupation of coastal marine environments. The site is located on the Bun Peninsula along the eastern shoreline of the Gulf of Zula and covers an area of approximately 7 km by 1 km. Three main stratigraphic units are defined and discussed from oldest to youngest: (1) The Buri Formation is defined herein as a sequence of brackish-freshwater (estuarine) and fluvial-deltaic sediments consisting of mudstones, siltstones, sandstones, conglomerates and limestones with ash and pumice beds. Ar-Ar dating of pumice and tephras puts the time of deposition of this unit from about 0.91 to 0.72 Ma (Early-Middle Pleistocene). Several stone tools were discovered in the Buri Formation, indicating early human occupation of a coastal environment during the Early to Middle Pleistocene. (2) The Abdur Volcanic Complex (AVC) is a small basaltic shield complex that forms the highlands along the eastern part of the Abdur Site and extends to the north and south of the area. Basalts from this center were dated from 2.12 to 0.17 Ma, indicating that the volcanic complex has been tectonically and magmatically active prior to, during and after deposition of the Buri Formation. (3) The Abdur Reef Limestone (ARL) is the remnant of a shallow marine reef system deposited approximately 125 ka (last glacial highstand, isotope stage 5e) along the margins of the Abdur volcanic highlands. The ARL consists of a basal transgressive lag deposit overlain by extensive buildups of mollusks, echinoderms, bioclastic sands and corals up to 11 m thick. Numerous stone tools in the ARL fall into two tool kits, bifacial hand axes of the Acheulian industry and Middle Stone Age-type (MSA) obsidian flakes and blades. Their distribution suggests that foraging activities of early humans varied with environmental setting. The Buri Formation has been folded and faulted prior to deposition of the ARL, with dips as high as 36 degrees and vertical locally along fault zones. The ARL has been uplifted up to 8-15 m and tilted 1 degrees-5 degrees in a seaward direction. The area is cut by numerous faults, part of a regional NNW-trending fault system. Occurrences of Buri Formation equivalents to the north along the Buri Peninsula as well as in the area southwest of the Alid volcano suggest the area west of the escarpment was a broad lowland characterized by rivers, coastal lakes, and estuaries along the Red Sea coast during the Early to Middle Pleistocene. Reefs equivalent to the ARL covered large parts of the adjacent Buri Peninsula, the north end of Mt. Ghedem across the Gulf of Zula, and the Dahlak Archipelago to the north. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

New Estimates of Ice and Oxygen Fluxes Across the Entire Lid of Lake Vostok From Observations of Englacial Radio Wave Attenuation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Over deep Antarctic subglacial lakes, spatially varying ice thickness and the pressure-dependent melting point of ice result in distinct areas of melting and freeze-on at the ice-water interface, that is, at the lake lid. These ice mass fluxes drive lake circulation and, because basal Antarctic ice contains air clathrate, affect the input of oxygen to the lake, with implications for subglacial life. Inferences of rates of melting and freeze-on, that is, accretion rates, from radar layer tracking and geodesy are limited in spatial coverage and resolution. Here we develop a new method to estimate accretion rate, and the resulting oxygen input at a lake lid, using airborne radar data over Lake Vostok together with ice-temperature and chemistry data from the Vostok ice core. Because the lake lid is a coherent reflector of known reflectivity (at our radar frequency), we can infer depth-averaged radio wave attenuation in the ice, with a spatial resolution of similar to 1km along flight lines. Spatial variation in attenuation depends mostly on variation in ice temperature near the lid, which in turn varies strongly with ice mass flux at the lid. We model ice temperature versus depth with ice mass flux as a parameter, thus linking that flux to observed depth-averaged attenuation. The resulting map of melt and accretion rates independently reproduces features known from earlier studies but now covers the entire lid. We find that freeze-on is dominant when integrated over the lid, with an ice imbalance of 0.05 to 0.07km(3)/year, which is robust against uncertainties. Plain Language Summary Where ice meets water at the upper surface (i.e., the lid) of a subglacial lake, freezing to the lid or melting into the lake can occur. Distinct areas of freezing and melting affect lake water circulation. Furthermore, melting can introduce to the lake oxygen from ancient air trapped in deep ice. That oxygen input is important for understanding what organisms can live in the lake. Knowledge of lake lid melting and freezing has been sparse, but here we develop a new way to map melting and freezing using data from radar sounding and an ice core. We apply our method at Lake Vostok, Antarctica. We find, surprisingly, that the total amount of lid freezing exceeds that of melting. Because Antarctic ice flow carries away ice frozen to the lid, the lake would lose water, and its level would go down, unless there is some compensating inflow. The level of Lake Vostok is observed to be neither rising nor falling, so we infer that meltwater flows into the lake from surrounding ice-covered terrain. That flow carries minerals and other chemicals important for any life in the lake, so our result may change views on what can live there.					; MacGregor, Joseph/A-6746-2010	MacGregor, Joseph/0000-0002-5517-2235; Winebrenner, Dale/0000-0003-2341-1083; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2019	124	3					795	811		10.1029/2018JF004692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004692													WOS:000463993300008

The base data is composed of over 60 years of geological data covering an area of 16 by 8 km, and from surface down to 1830 m depth. This paper concentrates on the methods used in the GeoSpace system for the processing, integration, display and interpretation of such a large and diverse data set. A block model was developed that recorded the relative frequency of each geological feature within each block. The data input for the block models were based on recoding of the Campbell Mine drilling and channel sample databases into lithological, alteration and structural subsets. The value for each geological characteristic inserted into each block is calculated from all available data that falls within the block. Relative and absolute comparisons of the individual variables provide a targeted outcome from which the blocks are coloured for visual inspection. Different combinations of variable comparisons can be evaluated so that required features are highlighted for interpretation. Blocks are displayed to illuminate the 'dominant' rock type, according to a formula that may be varied interactively to display the features required by the geologist. This flexibility allows rapid remodelling of lithological distributions, commonly highlighting minor lithological packages not readily visualised in, and interpreted from, drillhole traces alone. The 3D geological model was built from the drillhole datasets and old mine plans utilising standard 3D mining, GIS and database software, with several iterations of plan and sectional interpretation. Near surface bedrock geological interpretations were further constrained by low level aeromagnetic data. The Geospace approach employs an innovative technique for visualisation of the distribution of lithological packages and alteration via block modelling. The method utilises the block model format of data handling as it is considered to be more visible than drilling, flexible enough to incorporate a wide range of data sources, and allows for spatial proximity relationships to be investigated. The method is a simple form of processing large data sets so that results are clearly visible. The calculation is much more rapid than estimation procedures, and does not have any requirement for geostatistical interpretation which is also time consuming. Geospace is not unique to any mine environment software and it is expected to be able to be performed in any system. The proper portrayal of the internal structure of the mineralised body will provide practical input to exploration and mining principally in the areas of resource estimation, exploration vectoring and ore/waste characterisation and may be incorporated with other data to include mine support and mine scheduling.																					1-920806-06-7				2003	2003	8					181	186																WOS:000238481700021

Nevertheless, controversies in Holocene moisture change pattern of ACA and poorly-constrained age models of related studies have made the discussion about late Holocene moisture changes in ACA and their influences on the evolution of ASR difficult. Recently, a high-resolution age model during the late Holocene was established for Kalakuli Lake, a small glacier lake located in the core area of ACA. A thorough rock magnetic investigation was carried out on Kalakuli Lake sediments based on this age model. The magnetic mineral assemblage of Kalakuli Lake sediments is still dominated by primary magnetite despite minor diagenetic effects. Comparisons of rock magnetic records to parameters previously used as indicator of glacier fluctuations suggest that clastic input to Kalakuli Lake was high (low) and magnetic grain size is relatively larger (smaller), when glaciers on Muztagh Ata advanced (retreated). The ARM/SIRM ratio, a magnetic grain size proxy, is directly related to lake hydrodynamics, which are ultimately controlled by glacier fluctuations on Muztagh Ata as the result of regional moisture changes. Late Holocene moisture changes indicated by the ARM/SIRM ratio are consistent with cool/wet and warm/dry oscillations indicated by the unweighted average of biomarker hydrogen isotopic data of the C-26 and C-28 n-alkanoic acids in a previous study about Kalakuli Lake, most moisture change records of the core area of ACA and winter insolation of the Northern Hemisphere, but opposite to Asian monsoon evolution. Given Asian monsoon and the westerlies are mutually inhibited, we propose that late Holocene moisture changes in the core area of ACA were controlled by the intensity of Asian monsoon versus the westerlies under the governance of solar insolation. Generally increased moisture since the late Holocene indicated by the ARM/SIRM ratio favored cultural exchange and integration between the western and the eastern Eurasia, which paved the way for the formation of ASR. Coincidence between significant increase in moisture at similar to 200 BC suggested by the ARM/SIRM ratio and the formation of ASR indicates moisture as an important factor that facilitated the formation of ASR. The onsets of three prosperity periods of ASR in the history generally correspond to periods when moisture was relatively high, nevertheless, stagnant periods of ASR do not coincide with periods when moisture was relatively low in the core area of ACA. Disorganized correlations between stagnant periods of ASR and moisture changes in the core area of ACA suggest that moisture is not the decisive factor influencing the evolution of ASR.					wu, xudong/KGL-1857-2024														1000-9515	1755-6724				JUN	2020	94	3			SI		658	667		10.1111/1755-6724.14539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14539													WOS:000544351300009
J	Higgs, R				Higgs, R			Ross and Bude Formations (Carboniferous, Ireland and England): Reinterpretedas lake-shelf turbidites	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Ross Formation (Namurian, Ireland) and the near-identical Bude Formation (Westphalian, England), both amply described in the literature, are used by oil companies as deep-sea-fan reservoir analogues. However, the Ross Formation is reinterpreted here, like the Bude Formation in recent publications, to be composed of river-fed turbidites deposited on the wave-influenced northern shelf of a Variscan foreland-basin take, which also had a southern flysch trough. Key features of these formations are: (i) two classes of thin (<0.4m) sandstone "event bed" in shale comprising (a) structureless turbidite-like beds, and (b) rippled beds with combined-flow ripples and/or hummocky cross-stratification, neither structure having previously been reported from the Ross Formation; (ii) "trademark" tabular packets (1-10m) of amalgamated event beds which interfinger laterally with mudstones; (iii) sharp packet bases and tops; (iv) rare sinuous channel fills; and (v) rare thick (1-10m) shale units, each containing a thin (cm-dm) fossiliferous bond. The fossil bonds are interpreted here as maximum flooding surfaces, reflecting glacioeustatic marine incursions over the take spill point (sill), forcing the lake to rise and to turn marine or strongly brackish; these bands define Galloway-type depositional sequences 50-100m thick. During eustatic falls, the take was forced down to sill level, where it perched and turned fresh (desalination). Intervals containing sandstone packets are attributed to the failing-stage and lowstand systems tracts, each packet representing a higher-order lowstand systems tract. Packets are interpreted as tongue shaped, supplied by river-fed underflows. Packet bases (sharp) represent the storm-wave graded equilibrium shelf profile, glacioeustatically forced to its lowstand position. On this erosion surface were deposited underflow turbidites produced by floods in the catchment. Occasional catastrophic storms on the lake shaved these turbidites and interfingering fair-weather muds back down to the equilibrium level, leaving behind a subsidence-accommodated increment whose surface was sculpted by storm wind and wave currents, forming hummocks, combined-flow ripples and erosional megaflutes. Whenever a river-fed underflow accompanied one of these storms, the resulting highly erosive combined flow carved a sinuous channel on the wave-sculpted equilibrium surface. Sandstone-shale intervals separating the sandstone packets are interpreted as transgressive-and highstand systems tracts. They contain both turbidites and wave-modified turbidites (rippled beds), deposited on the out-of-equilibrium drowned shelf. A gradual rotation in sole-mark direction with time in both formations is attributed to a reversal of Coriolis deflection as the plate drifted north across the equator, causing underflows (deflected along-shelf geostrophically) to flow first NEwards and then SWwards on an inferred SE-facing shelf. The lack of evidence for emergence in the Ross and Bude Formations, in spite of the great thicknesses (460m and 1,290m, respectively) of these shallow-water deposits, is attributed to regulation of minimum water depth firstly by the lake sill blocking eustatically-forced exposure, and secondly by storm grading, preventing emergence by sedimentation.

Good exposure and an abundance of pre-rifting markers indicate 250 km of extension of the upper crust over the past 16 m.y. Extension of several hundred percent has occurred in two distinct deformational domains, Death Valley and Lake Mead, separated by a relatively unextended block, the Spring Mountains. The limited topographic differences between extended and unextended regions imply that material with a crustal density has been added to the extended regions. Although igneous activity can provide some of this added material, kinematics of extension within the Death Valley region suggest that lateral flow of the middle and lower crust into the extended areas accounts for much of the needed material. Such flow is consistent with geochemical analysis of intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks in the Death Valley area. These volcanic rocks contain isotopic and geochemical trends similar to Mesozoic plutonic rocks from the western part of the Sierra Nevada, about 150-200 km to the west, thus suggesting that the upper crust has moved by that amount relative to deeper crustal levels. Geochemical analyses of basaltic magmas in the region indicate that two mantle reservoirs are present: an OIB-type asthenosphere, and an old, Precambrian continental lithosphere. The ancient lithospheric mantle is preserved beneath the Central Basin and Range, but to the west and north the basaltic rocks have a signature compatible with an asthenospheric origin. These differences indicate that the degree of thinning and removal of the mantle lithosphere varies considerably across the Central Basin and Range. These differences are compatible with the inference from geological and geophysical arguments that thinning of the mantle lithosphere at the latitude of the Central Basin and Range is localized beneath the Sierra Nevada. Geophysical measurements have shown that the thickness of the crust varies little from a mean of about 30 km over the entire Basin and Range; the crust under the high Sierra Nevada to the west might have about the same thickness. Estimates of the buoyancy of the crust and mantle based on P-wave crustal structures suggest that the most buoyant, and thus probably the warmest, mantle lies under the Sierra Nevada and not under areas of strongly thinned upper crust of the Death Valley and Lake Mead regions to the east. Similar analyses indicate that the extended upper crust of the Northern Basin and Range overlies an upper mantle more buoyant than that of the Southern and Central Basin and Range; this is in accord with geochemical and seismological inferences. Thus, the style of lithospheric extension varies considerably both along and across the strike of the Basin and Range.

ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY OF CENOZOIC ROCKS IN THE USHUMUNSKOE BROWN COAL FIELD OF THE MIDDLE AMUR SEDIMENTARY BASIN	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is conditioned by the necessity to expand the resource base of the Russian Far East. The study of sedimentary basins and their hydrocarbon potential, the development of new forecast technologies for traditional and unconventional hydrocarbon fields is a priority for the Russian Academy of Sciences for many years. The evaluation of source rocks based on levels of their enrichment with the organic matter and its generation potential will provide valuable data for basin modeling. Besides, given that the Ushumunskoe source rocks have not been studied by organic geochemical methods, the present study sets out to clarify the conditions of the organic matter accumulation, and to reconstruct landscapes and biota in the Cenozoic Era. The aim of the research is to characterize the biological source of the organic matter, conditions of its accumulation, diagenetic settings and the level of the Ushumunskoe source rocks maturity. Objects of the research are the Ushumunskoe coals, clays and siltstones from the Middle Amur sedimentary basin. Methods: comparison of the results of pyrolysis and isotope analysis of the organic matter and characteristics of biomarker hydrocarbons obtained using chromatography-mass spectrometry in saturated and aromatic fractions of bitumen extracts, evaluation of sources, as well as diagenetic and catagenetic conditions of organic matter. Results. The Paleogene-Neogene source rocks of the Ushumunskoe brown coal field in the Middle Amur sedimentary basin were studied by the methods of organic geochemistry for the first time. The organic matter of the studied samples has signs of both terrestrial and sapropelic types. The organic carbon isotopic composition, n-alkanes distribution, the presence of kaurane, beyerane, phyllocladanes (biomarkers of higher plants Podocarpaceae and Araucareaceae) in the saturated fraction of extractable bitumens, retene (biomarker of conifers) in the aromatic fraction indicate the terrestrial (humic) nature of organic matter. At the same time, in most samples the aromatic fraction characteristics correspond to the sapropelic organic matter, which is evidenced by low concentrations of phenanthrenes, high concentrations of mono- and triaromatic steroids, distributions of methyldibenzothiophenes, and probable presence of long-chain alkylnaphthalenes (biomarkers of lake algae Botryococcus braunii). Phytane concentrations are significantly higher, than pristane, and half of the samples according to the hydrogen index (HI) values belong to type II. Due to the absence of marine deposits in the study area, type II is probably a mixture of type I (lacustrine) and III (continental). Moreover, judging by the HI variations throughout the section, depositional environments changed repeatedly from lacustrine to peatbog and vice versa. In some samples, the maxima in the acyclic isoprenoids fall on i-C-21 and i-C-22, possibly due to the significant contribution of archea to the original living substance. According to the high concentrations of dibenzothiophenes, the organic matter underwent diagenesis with high content of hydrogen sulfide in sediment. Probably, the duality of signatures (terrestrial and sapropelic) is associated with the specificity of the initial biota in this basin and is characteristic of its age and/or geographical localization. The vitrinite reflectance data, pyrolytic characteristics, high carbon preference index in n-alkanes, the presence of biohopanes and hopenes, almost complete absence of typical steranes and terpanes, and distribution of triaromatic steroids are interpreted as indications of immature organic matter, with the latter potentially enhancing such a duality of characteristics.

Species richness of the remaining algal groups is low and encompasses planktic-living taxa. Spatial distribution of algal groups and cyanobacteria depended mostly on water temperature and flow velocity. Similarities among lake and stream cyanobacteria and algae are pretty low (R-2 < 40%). In streams, assemblages do not cluster by altitude or substrate type. In the lake, the periphytic assemblages are not clustered by life mode of host (submerged vs emergent), evolutionary group (angiosperms vs charophytes), or the occurrence of carbonate deposits. Diatom dominance changes along with plant substrate, Cymbella microcephala being the most frequently dominating species in the lake. Beta diversity of benthic algae happens to be higher in stream environments, and that of diatoms is higher than that of overall algae and cyanobacteria jointly. Mosses were only frequent upstream the lake, particularly at the Manadero spring. Vascular hydrophyte taxa was 9 (3 characean and 6 angiosperms), whereas those of helophytes and hygrophytes were 13. Chara hispida attains higher biomass than C. vulgaris, and this is located at deeper depths than the former, but it does not grow every year. Groenlandia densa (always in areas shallower than 2 m) reached high biomass but the cover of Sparganium emersum was much higher, occurring throughout the lake perimeter close to Cladium mariscus. Ranunculus trichophyllus depicts a very small cover at the northeast basin. Regarding emergent vegetation, shores are almost entirely surrounded by a cutsedge fringe (Cladium mariscus) and reed (Phragmites australis) and, in flooded southeastern areas, the wide-leaf cattail (Typha latifolia) grows. Carex riparia can be found at the north shore and C. paniculata occurs at east. The lowest carbon content was found in Groenlandia, whereas Sparganium shown the highest nitrogen. Phosphoras concentration in stoneworts was at the lower extreme of what is reported in the literature. Cladium contained less N and P, but higher C, whereas Phragmites harbours more N and Carex acutiformis more P. The lowest N:P ratio is found in Carex riparia, with Cladium exhibiting the highest P limitation. Among the four studied submerged macrophytes, angiosperms produce and respire a lot more than Chara spp; with Groenlandia densa being the highest net producer. As a whole, production per unit of DW biomass of Somolinos submerged plants can exceed the ranges measured by other authors. Groenlandia again showed the highest production and respiration rates, (376-1.227 mg C/m(2) h y 509-857 mg O-2/m(2) h, respectively). Reed net photosynthesis was the highest and more variable of all three emergent species tested, followed by that of greater pond sedge (Carex riparia).																					978-84-00-10443-6; 978-84-00-10442-9				2018	46						159	218																WOS:000637015500010

Spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in water and sediments of a freshwater system (Antua River, Portugal)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microplastics (particles with a size < 5mm), one of the most emerging aquatic pollutants, are of particular concern since they can reach high densities and interact with biotic and abiotic environment. The occurrence of microplastics in freshwater systems is less understood than in marine environment. Hence, the present study aims to provide new insights into microplastics abundances and distribution in Antua River (Portugal) by applying the isolation method of wet peroxide oxidation with addition of zinc chloride to water and sediment samples collected in March and October 2016, in three sampling sites. The abundance of microplastics in water ranged from 5 to 8.3 mg m(-3) or 58-193 items m(-3) in March and from 5.8-51.7 mg m(-3) or 71-1265 items m(-3) in October. In sediments, the abundance ranged from 13.5-52.7 mg kg(-1) or 100-629 items kg(-1) in March and from 2.6-71.4 mg kg(-1) or 18-514 items kg(-1) in October. The water and sediment samples with the greatest abundances were from Sao Joao da Madeira and Aguincheira, respectively. Spatio-temporal distribution showed different pattern according to methodological approaches, seasonal and hydrodynamic conditions and the proximity to urban/industry areas. Analysis of plastics by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy underline polyethylene and polypropylene as the most common polymer types identified in this work. The low medium high oxidation ratio was 56: 22: 22 (%) in March and 61: 31: 8 (%) in October. Foams and fibers were the most abundant type in Sao Joao da Madeira, while fibers and fragments were the most abundant in Aguincheira and Estarreja in water and sediment samples, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of rivers as carriage systems of microplastics. Further studies should be performed to identify point sources in order to mitigate the microplastics contamination in aquatic systems. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Maréchal, JC; Perrochet, P				Maréchal, JC; Perrochet, P			New analytical solution for the study of hydraulic interaction between Alpine tunnels and groundwater	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE												The present paper addresses two major problems encountered during tunnel drilling and related to the hydraulic interaction with surrounding groundwater bodies. The first one is the prediction of water discharge into the tunnel, as a function of the geometric and hydrogeological data. The second problem is related to the assessment of the draining effects on surface waters (springs, lakes, wetlands). Surface monitoring campaigns are costly and evaluating their duration is a sensitive question. Both problems are tightly related and depend on aquifer dynamics. It is shown that in a geological context with steeply dipping structures, nearly vertical, inducing series of aquifers and aquicludes such as in the Alps, the drainage of the aquifer by the tunnel can be modelled by the analytical solution of Jacob and Lohman [1952] for artesian wells. First developed for horizontal, confined unsteady flow towards a vertical well with constant drawdown, it is adapted here to a horizontal tunnel by a rotation of pi/2. The main difference between this solution and more classical Theis' solutions is that a constant drawdown condition replaces the constant discharge rate condition. Hence, a relation is obtained for the time-dependent discharge rate Q(t) detected at the tunnel after drilling, as a function of aquifer transmissivity (T), storage coefficient (S), initial drawdown (s(o)) and tunnel radius (r(o)). This analytical solution is compared to a finite-elements model simulating a draining tunnel in a simplified 2D vertical cross-section. The comparisons show that the decay of the tunnel discharge can be divided into two periods. During the first period, radial drawdown develops around the tunnel and there is excellent match between analytical and numerical results. Tunnel discharge results from the decompression of rock and water (storage effects) as a response to the sudden initial drawdown at the tunnel location. During the second period, the drawdown cone reaches the aquifer limits (lateral and upper) and numerical discharge rates decrease faster than analytical rates because of hydraulic heads decline at the aquifer limits. In the Alps, such trends were observed for the discharge rates into the Simplon and Mont-Blanc tunnels, and the analytical solution of Jacob and Lohman [1952] was applied to the first discharge period to evaluate aquifer transmissivity and storage coefficients. As indicated by the simulations, and corroborated by field observations, the analytical solution is only valid during a first period after tunnel opening, the duration of which scaling with the inverse of the aquifer diffusivity (T/S). In the second part of the paper, dimensionless type-curves are presented to enable rapid evaluation of the time where a given drawdown is observed at a given distance from the tunnel. Accounting for tunnel geometry (radius and depth) and aquifer parametres (T and S), these curves could for instance help in practice to determine when surface waters would start to be affected by a draining tunnel underneath. Although neglecting the boundary effects discussed in the first part of the paper, these type-curves demonstrate the great inertia of mountain aquifers, and could be used to adjust the duration of surface monitoring campaigns according to the specific tunnel/aquifer settings..

The carbonate rocks consist of limestone and dolomite in Tanzania, but only dolomite has been identified in Kenya. Sepiolite and mixed-layered kerolite/stevensite (Ke/St) are subordinate constituents of the carbonate rocks. The carbonate rocks and overlying bedded sepiolite were deposited in a semiarid lake basin at the foot of the large volcano Kilimanjaro. Calcite and dolomite of the carbonate rocks have delta(18)O values 4-6 parts per thousand lower than calcite and dolomite of the late Pleistocene Amboseli Clays, suggesting that the Sinya Beds were deposited in the middle or early Pleistocene under a different climatic regime when meteoric water had lower delta(18)O values than at present. Mg-rich clay minerals form veins and fill cavities in the Sinya Beds. The principal clay minerals are sepiolite and Ke/St, some of which contains substantial Al and Fe (Al-Ke/St). NEWMOD(R) modeling and other X-ray diffraction (XRD) data suggest that most of the Ke/St contains 25-50 percent kerolite layers, but minor amounts of kerolite-rich Ke/St are present in some samples. Illite with an inferred high content of Fe or Mg is a minor constituent of the samples with Al-Ke/St. The cavity-filling clays were chemically precipitated, as shown by field relationships and SEM study. The early-deposited clays of veins and cavities are principally Ke/St with minor sepiolite, and the latest clay is sepiolite (meerschaum), generally with minor Ke/St. The delta(18)O values of cavity-filling Ke/St range from 22.5-25.6 parts per thousand and correlate with mineral composition, with the highest values associated with the highest content of stevensite and the lowest values with the highest content of kerolite. This relation suggests that high salinities favored stevensite and low salinities favored kerolite. delta(18)O values of sepiolite (meerschaum) fall in the middle of the range for Ke/St, suggesting that salinity was not the main control on sepiolite precipitation. High values of a(SiO2)/a(Mg2+) may have been a major factor in sepiolite precipitation. Different mixtures of dilute ground water and saline, alkaline lake water in pore fluids may largely account for the differences in clay mineralogy of cavity-filling clays. Sepiolite is the dominant clay mineral in lacustrine sediments of the Amboseli Basin, and the cavity-filling sepiolite may reflect a high proportion of lake water. The low-Al Ke/St may have formed from fluids with a higher proportion of ground water. Detrital clay was very likely a factor in forming the Al-Ke/St, for which delta(18)O values suggest a saline environment.																			0009-8604					AUG	1995	43	4					455	466		10.1346/CCMN.1995.0430409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1346/CCMN.1995.0430409													WOS:A1995TG44900009

THE DIGITAL MAP OF THE PLIOCENE-QUATERNARY CRUSTAL FAULTS IN THE SOUTHERN EAST SIBERIA AND THE ADJACENT NORTHERN MONGOLIA	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												Introduction. Studying and mapping of faults in the Earth's crust is one of the priority objectives in structural geology and tectonophysics. Generally, faults are associated with mineral deposits, thermal springs and earthquakes, and fault zones are areas of the most dangerous geological processes and various geophysical anomalies. In this regard, digital maps and databases on faults and fault zones are highly demanded both for science and practical applications. This paper presents a new digital map of the southern East Siberia and the adjacent Northern Mongolia, which shows faults in the crust which were active in the Pliocene-Quaternary. The map covers the territory between 96-124 degrees E to 49-58 degrees N. An annex to this paper contains files with geospatial data on the mapped faults. The input data, and their synthesis. We consolidated the database on faults active in the Pliocene-Quaternary stage of the crust development and mapped the faults on the basis of digital elevation models SRTM 90 m [Consortium for Spatial Information, 2004], space images from Landsat series satellites (Google Earth), electronic bathymetry data on Lake Baikal [Sherstyankin et al., 2006], topographic maps (1: 200000 scale), regional and global earthquake catalogs, as well as the publications and maps based on the earlier studies of active tectonics and earthquake traces with the use of the ActiveTectonics Information System developed by the research team lead by the author of this paper [Lunina et al., 2014b]. For the major part of the southern East Siberia, we collected and processed our field observation data on faults and related deformation features (Fig. 1). The geographic locations of the faults were mapped with the use of MapInfo GIS. The precise detection of tectonic faults, topographically represented by river lineaments and benching, was ensured by the synthesis of cartographic, literature and field materials. A significant number of the detected lineaments, that were not confirmed by any data due to the poor knowledge of some regions in the southern East Siberia and the adjacent territories, are included in the database with a special mark and shown on the map as inferred faults. Results and discussion. The digital map (Fig. 2) shows 1678 faults composed of 2315 segments, including 1097 true, and 1218 inferred ones, identified by the fault strike changes or fragmentation. Using the consolidated fault database, we constructed maps showing fault segments differing in the degree of activity (Fig. 3), displacement types (Fig. 4 and 7), and ages of the last activations (Fig. 8). Besides, we constructed a map of seismically active faults that can generate M >= 5.5 earthquakes. The analysis of the thematic maps of faults gives grounds to conclusions that have been either partly supported or controversial, yet now are based on the factual justification of the faults in the ActiveTectonics Information System database. It is shown that the Baikal rift zone is bordered in the southwest by the Busiyngol basin and the West Belino-Busiyngol fault, and in the northeast by the Olyokma and Nyukzha faults located in the basins of the same-name rivers. In the areas located westward and eastward of these boundaries, the rift regime (crustal stretching, extension with strike-slip faulting, and shearing) is abruptly changed to transpression. In general, similar activation features are typical of the southern East Siberia in the Holocene and the present time. Such features include seismogenic activation episodes when mainly the faults of the NE-SW and sublatitudinal strike are renovated -normal faults, left-lateral normal faults with a strike-slip component, left-lateral strike-slip faults, leftlateral strike-slip faults with a normal component, and left-lateral strike-slip faults with a reverse component. The NEstriking faults are insignificant to the west of 98 degrees meridian. Conclusion. The digital fault map (Fig. 2) and the thematic maps (Fig. 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9) can be used as a tectonic basis for the synthesis of geological, geophysical, hydrogeological and geodetic data in studies aimed at forecasting of hazardous endogenic and exogenic geological processes. The undoubted advantage of this digital fault map over other regional fault maps is its integrated mapping framework that consolidates a large amount of data (collected mostly by the Siberian scientists) in the uniform information space. Newly gathered data can be input in the map's database that is available for off-line viewing on html-pages.					; Lunina, Oksana/A-8635-2014	Lunina, Oksana/0000-0001-7743-8877; 													2078-502X						2016	7	3					407	434		10.5800/GT-2016-7-3-0215	http://dx.doi.org/10.5800/GT-2016-7-3-0215													WOS:000409848500003

At the end of the Preboreal Chronozone, however, a glacier readvance occurred. Terminal moraines were deposited by outlet valley glaciers from the Jostedalsbreen Plateau up to 1 km beyond Little Ice Age moraines. Inferred from the altitude of lateral moraines formed during this readvance and calculations of the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) depression based on an accumulation area ratio (AAR) of 0.6, the average depression of the ELA was 325 + 75/-115 m below the present. By assuming a similar precipitation pattern as at present, this suggests a mean temperature decline of about 2-degrees-C. Palynological investigations from Sygneskardet, Sunndalen, indicate that climate like the present was achieved just after 9000 BP. The Holocene climatic optimum occurred during the Atlantic Chronozone, with elm (Ulmus) stands growing at the present birch (Betula) forest limit in Sunndalen, and pine (Pinus) growing at Styggevatnet to an altitude of at least 1160 m. During this period the mean summer temperature is estimated to have been at least 2.7 and 1.8-degrees-C warmer than at present, with and without the local climatic effect of Jostedalsbreen, respectively. An inferred rise of the ELA of about 400 m from the present altitude suggests that possibly no glaciers existed on the Jostedalsbreen Plateau during the Holocene climatic optimum. Vegetational changes as deduced from palynological studies, lowered tree limits and increased resedimentation in peat bogs indicate general climatic deterioration since the Late Atlantic Chronozone. A significant Alnus decline 6300 BP and a Betula expansion 5300 BP, as recorded from palynological studies of peat bogs in Sprongdalen, is interpreted to represent the initial Neoglaciation on the Jostedalsbreen Plateau. Lithostratigraphic evidence at a section in the upper part of Glomsdalen may indicate a minor Neoglacial phase close to 6000 BP. The first pronounced Neoglacial event in the Jostedalsbreen region, however, was bracketed between 3700 and 3100 BP. Sporteggbreen, the upper part lying ca. 30 m above the present regional glaciation threshold, was formed around 500 BP at the initiation of the Little Ice Age. Gelifluction at 1000 m altitude began after 3200-2800 BP. During the Medieval Period, glaciers were smaller than now. At the northwestern part of Jostedalsbreen an initial Little Ice Age glacier expansion is dated to have occurred after 890 +/- 60 BP (A.D. 1030-1220). From the early 14th century, and especially from the mid-17th century, a severe climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age is historically documented. Around Jostedalsbreen this advance culminated during the mid-18th century. Documents suggest that the western outlet glaciers from Jostedalsbreen reached their maximum Little Ice Age position some years before the longer eastern outlet valley glaciers. A typical depression of the ELA during the Little Ice Age of 100-150 m indicates a mean temperature decline from the present of ca. 0.5-1-degrees-C.																			0277-3791						1991	10	1					87	114		10.1016/0277-3791(91)90032-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(91)90032-P													WOS:A1991EW29000005

Dwarf benthic (DB), large benthic (LB), planktivorous (PL) and piscivorous (PI) morphs can be distinguished and differ markedly in head morphology, colouration and maximum fork length (FLmax,), reflecting their different resource specialisations within the lake. The four morphs in Thingvallavatn are thought to have been isolated for approximately 10 000 years, since shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. We tested the null hypothesis that the pattern of muscle fibre recruitment was the same in all morphs, reflecting their recent diversification. The cross-sectional areas of fast and slow muscle fibres were measured at 0.7 FL in 46 DB morphs, 23 LB morphs, 24 PL morphs and 22 PI morphs, and the ages of the charr were estimated using sacculus otoliths. In fish larger than 10 g, the maximum fibre diameter scaled with body mass (M-b)(0.18) for both fibre types in all morphs. The number of myonuclei per cm fibre length increased with fibre diameter, but was similar between morphs. On average, at 60 pm diameter, there were 2264 nuclei cm(-1) in slow fibres and 1126 nuclei cm(-1) in fast fibres. The absence of fibres of diameter 4-10 mum was used to determine the FL at which muscle fibre recruitment stopped. Slow fibre number increased with body length in all morphs, scaling with b. In contrast, the recruitment of fast muscle fibres continued until a clearly identifiable FL, corresponding to 18-19 cm in the dwarf morph, 24-26 cm in the pelagic morph, 32-33 cm in the large benthic morph and 34-35 cm in the piscivorous morph. The maximum fast fibre number (FNmax) in the dwarf morph (6.97X 10(4)) was 56.5 % of-that found in the LB and PI morphs combined (1.23X10(5)) (P<0.001). Muscle fibre recruitment continued until a threshold body size and occurred at a range of ages, starting at 4+ years in the DB morph and 7+ years in the LB and PI morphs. Our null hypothesis was therefore rejected for fast muscle and it was concluded that the dwarf condition was associated with a reduction in fibre number. We then investigated whether variations in development temperature associated with different spawning sites and periods were responsible for the observed differences in muscle cellularity between morphs. Embryos from the DB. LB and PL morphs were incubated at temperature regimes simulating cold subterranean spring-fed sites (2.2-3.2degreesC) and the general lakebed (4-7degreesC). Myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) were identified using specific antibodies to Paired box protein 7 (Pax 7), Forkhead box protein K1-alpha (FoxK1-alpha), MyoD and Myf-5. The progeny showed no evidence of developmental plasticity in the numbers of either MPCs or muscle fibres. Juveniles and adult stages of the DB and LB morphs coexist and have a similar diet. We therefore conclude that the reduction in FNmax, in the dwarf morph probably has a genetic basis and that gene networks regulating myotube production are under high selection pressure. To explain these findings we propose that there is an optimal fibre size. and hence number, which varies with maximum body size and reflects a trade-off between diffusional constraints on fibre diameter and the energy costs of maintaining ionic gradients. The predictions of the optimal fibre size hypothesis and its consequences for the adaptive evolution of muscle architecture in fishes are briefly discussed.

The difficulties of locating occupation sites in this landscape cannot be overestimated. Although valuable for its preservation of palaeosols, the accumulation of sediment deposited by the river Cauca and its tributaries during periods of flooding can be extremely rapid and the earlier archaeological sites (1000 B.C. to 500 A.D.) are generally buried beneath several metres of alluvium. Under these circumstances, traditional site survey has limited potential and the most promising strategy is the location of palaeosols with evidence of human activity based on soil analysis and palaeobotanical studies. Sedimentology from a dozen deep cores is providing invaluable information on the environments that early human populations in the area would have enjoyed or coped with. The cores testify to a highly dynamic river Cauca and its tributaries resulting in a series of rapid local environmental changes. Besides extensive periodic flooding, past populations were probably affected by tectonic events since numerous faults cross the region. Volcanic ash is a component of many of the soil cores but much was redeposited material from earlier falls, probably during the Pleistocene. Direct archaeological evidence of human activity during the Early and Middle Holocene is limited to a mastodon skeleton with butchering marks on its ribs, and to a surface find of a stone tool (azada) characteristic of this period. Of the numerous fertile palaeosols detected in cores, some have agricultural characteristics and there is evidence of fires, possibly for clearing fields, from the late seventh millennium B.C. while by the third millennium B.C. a site provides evidence of burning in combination with the cultivation of maize (Zea mays) and arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). While a relatively large number of archaeological sites testify to human activity over much of southwestern Colombia during the Early and Middle Holocene, research has drawn attention to a period of archaeological silence between 2500 and 1000 B.C. when Formative societies were developing in other regions of South America. An important focus of this project is the search for traces of human activity during this period. The palaeosols have important potential for acquiring information on this question since stratigraphical evidence suggests that many lie within this time range. By the Late Holocene (c. 500 B.C.) the Ilama population was established in that region of the alluvial valley centred on Lake Sonso and the town of Palmira, followed by Yotoco and, further south, Malagana; in contrast, in the northern sector of the valley evidence for this sequence remains tentative. Here the only settlement site located so far with very late Formative characteristics produced an entirely new style of pottery. This site (first century B.C.) was in wooded marshland where houses must have been built on stilts, contrasting with Late Period sites (c. AD 500-1500), occupied by a sequence of different cultural groups of the Sonsoide tradition and located on slightly higher ground within the flood plain or in the piedmont.					; Duncan, Neil/KXQ-9817-2024	Duncan, Neil A./0000-0002-3178-7454; Berrio, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-9198-9277													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 15	2019	505						34	54		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.12.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.12.022													WOS:000463474300004

Lake Shebety is a glacial moraine lake of the Baikal Lake basin, Russia that could be used as a pattern for studying biodiversity and adaptive mechanisms of aquatic communities. This paper is aimed to identify the essential transient factors that regulate the composition and structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton in different zones of Lake Shebety. This will provide a better understanding of the plankton dynamics under the extreme continental climate. The present article is the first limnological investigation conducted for the water body on the above mentioned factors. Samples were collected during the summer of 2002 and 2016. Lake Shebety is located at 1567.4 m above sea level in the Khentei-Daurian Highland which lies in the Chikoi National Park, Trans-Baikalsky Krai, Russia. The research was performed on the basin morphometry and hydrochemical composition, along with hydrobiological studies of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Typical ecosystem features include oligotrophic status, low salinity, and high oxygen content. The lake is mainly characterised by deep-water areas with shallow-water shorelines. The study covers environmental factors determining the distribution and development of plankton communities in a mountain deep-water lake under extreme continental climate condition. We have detected a total of 35 algae species belonging to the following phyla: Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta, Dinophyta, Chlorophyta, and Charophyta. The data on zooplankton consisted of 35 species representing the phyla of Rotifera, Cladocera, and Copepoda. The greatest diversity of species was observed for the diatoms and cladocerans. It is apparent that the geographical distribution of some species of rotifers and crustaceans has been expanded. The species of Euchlanis alata, Acantocyclops capillatus, and Cyclops abyssorum are rare species for the water bodies in the Trans-Baikalsky Krai. The littoral plankton community is more diverse in components and quantities as compared to the pelagic one. As per the CCorA, the factors that contribute to the abundance and biomass of Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta, Dinophyta, Rotifera, Cladocera, and Copepoda have been observed in the following descending order: depth, phosphorus content, water temperature, and pH in littoral zone; pH, color, turbidity, nitrogen content determine density of Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Copepoda in the pelagic zone. The abundance of alga Crucigeniella irregularis and rotifers Kellicottia longispina and Conochilus unicornis were positively related to the phosphate content in the shallow areas. The abundance of the phytoplankton species Kephyrion doliolum, Cryptomonas ovata, Crucigenia tetrapedia, Peridinium sp. and zooplankton species Arctodiaptomus neithammeri and Cyclops abyssorum are associated with chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus content, depth, and the temperature in deep-water areas.

J	EVANS, SG; HUNGR, O; ENEGREN, EG				EVANS, SG; HUNGR, O; ENEGREN, EG			THE AVALANCHE LAKE ROCK AVALANCHE, MACKENZIE MOUNTAINS, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES, CANADA - DESCRIPTION, DATING, AND DYNAMICS	CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL												At Avalanche Lake, located in the Backbone Ranges of the Mackenzie Mountains, about 200 x 10(6) m(3) of massive Devonian carbonate rock slid down remarkably planar bedding surfaces dipping at 30 degrees and created a spectacular runup on the opposite valley side onto a topographic feature called the Shelf. The interpretation of events at Avalanche Lake has recently been subject to controversy. It has been argued by other workers that the rock avalanche could not have run onto the Shelf without glacier ice partially filling the valley, thus reducing the magnitude of the actual runup, and implying that the rock avalanche took place at the end of the Pleistocene. Evidence is presented indicating that the rock avalanche occurred in an ice-free environment. It consists of the nature of the detachment surface, the morphology and location of the rock avalanche debris, the presence of levees in the debris and isolated patches of debris on valley-side slopes, and the entrainment of alluvial deposits and conifer fragments from the valley floor in the Shelf Lobe debris. In addition, radiocarbon ages obtained from entrained wood in the debris, converted to calendric years, indicate that the landslide took place in this millennium, with a 95% probability of it having occurred no earlier than 1440 A.D. No glacier ice then existed in the valley. Based on this evidence the behaviour of the rock avalanche is reconstructed. It is characterized by dramatic mobility in which the rock avalanche split into two parts. The west part smashed into the opposite valley side and about 5 X 10(6) m(3) rode up onto the Shelf. The remainder (155 x 10(6) m(3)) fell back into the valley, partially running back up the detachment surface to an elevation 360 m above the valley, and then, reversing direction again, ran back into the valley bottom where it was deposited. The east part, the South Lobe (40 x 10(6) m(3)), ran down a valley reentrant opposite the detachment surface. The maximum vertical drop in the path is 1220 m, and the maximum runup is 640 m. The fahrboschung is 8 degrees for the Shelf Lobe and 10 degrees for the South Lobe. An analysis of the movement of the centre of gravity using a version of Koerner's dynamic model simulates the runup onto the Shelf, indicating that the presence of glacier ice is not necessary to account for the runup magnitude. Estimated maximum velocities during the movement reached 80 m/s. The runup is the highest recorded and on an empirical runup plot is highly anomalous in relation to the height of the descent slope. The case history illustrates the limitation of a dynamic model applied to a rock avalanche when it is assumed that the centre of gravity of the mass is displaced from the highest point on the detachment surface to the farthest tip of the debris. It also demonstrates that massive detachments have taken place in the Mackenzie Mountains in the comparatively recent past.																			0008-3674					OCT	1994	31	5					749	768		10.1139/t94-086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/t94-086													WOS:A1994PX10400014
J	CHRISTIE, WJ				CHRISTIE, WJ			EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL PROPAGATION AND THE WEATHER ON RECRUITMENT IN THE LAKE ONTARIO WHITEFISH FISHERY	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												No significant relationship could be found between variations in the level of fry planting and ensuing variations in the level of catch in the long-term statistics of the Lake Ontario whitefish gill-net fishery. An alternate-year planting experiment in which fry were planted in the even-numbered years 1944 through 1954, similarly failed to show a detectable level of contribution of the hatchery fish to the fishery. The supported year-classes averaged larger than those not given hatchery support but this was judged coincidental because of a phasing with an alternate-year periodicity which characterized the catch statistics over the whole series examined, and was present in the six years prior to the start of the alternate-year plantings. Estimates of spawning stock were calculated and it was not found that the progeny-per-parent ratios were significantly affected by the fry plantings. A possible explanation for the periodicity was suggested by a significant correlation between air temperatures at the times of spawning and hatching, and the strengths of the produced year-classes. Cold Novembers followed by warm Aprils appeared to provide conditions associated with the production of larger year-classes, with the opposite combinations relating to the weaker broods. The disappearance of lake trout and ciscoes from the commercial catch resulted in increased fishing pressure directed towards the capture of the white-fish. Increases in the efficiency and intensity of the fishing were observed during the period of the study and these were likely responsible for the reduction of the average age of the fish in the catch by almost one year, and the resultant restriction of the annual catch to one year-class in recent years. Probably because most of the fish are currently caught before first spawning, a decline in spawning stock was almost continuous during the study period. The year-to-year fluctuations in the level of the catch increased both because of the reduced average age, and because of a greater variation in year -class strength. The year-classes produced in favourable years tended to increase, down to quite low levels of stock. This gave a configuration similar to Ricker''s Type C reproduction curve, and which differed chiefly in that the limiting diagonal representing minimum reproduction fell below the replacement diagonal. It was suggested that the whitefish may require more than one spawning, to achieve stock replacement. The present instability of the catch, and the potentially serious effect of any sustained break in the rhythm of the climatic conditions suggest a condition of over-exploitation in this case.																									1963	20	3					597	646		10.1139/f63-043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-043													WOS:A1963WV54300002

It is a liquid-dominated convective system featuring a high salinity, rapid discharge, and heat loss derived into a selfsealing process. The reservoir temperature is higher than 200 degrees C, associated with a fracture zone linked to the Araro-Simirao fault. Samples of thermal fluids (water and gases) were collected from springs, wells, a mud pool, and runoff water in the study area. The waters had temperatures ranging from 31 degrees C and 76 degrees C and near-neutral pH values. Three hydrogeochemical facies types were identified, Na+- Cl-, Ca2+-Na+- HCO3-, and Na+-HCO3-, associated with deep thermal water, groundwater, and recently infiltrated water, respectively. According to the stable isotopes systematics, a binary mixture of thermal water and groundwater was calculated at a proportion from 61 % to 80 % of the thermal component. In the mud pool sample, the chemical composition of bubbling gas is CO2-dominated, with a mostly magmatic origin according to the Rc/Ra (5.19), CO2/3He (4.12 x 109) ratios, and the isotopic composition of delta 13 C (CO2) (-8 parts per thousand). The gases dissolved in waters are characterized by higher N2 and CO2 concentrations compared to the other gases, representing possible mixing processes between an end-member enriched in CO2 and the chemical composition of air-saturated water. Regarding helium isotopes, the gases are the result of mixing origins between crustal, atmospheric, and mantellic helium, and 3 groups were identified: 1) high contribution of mantle helium ranging from 21 to 66 % up to (Mud pool, LS07 and LS07A) 2) high contribution of crustal helium (LSA-02, LSA-08A, Araro) ranging from 55 to 80 % and 3) high contribution of atmospheric helium of 84 % (LSA-08). The delta 13 C (CO2) results show a primary interaction with magmatic environments and a slightly sedimentary origin. The origin of CO2, MORB-type, as well as other gases, may be similar to that in Los Azufres. However, these gases reach the surface through different vertical paths, resulting in varying fluid compositions. In the study area, the Araro-Simirao and Huigo faults would act as zones for these gas ascents from the degassing source (magma) at depth. According to the estimates of the magma aging model, the age of the mud pool sample is estimated to be 2.7 x 106 +/- 1.2 x 106 years, which is younger than the andesitic basement rocks. Additionally, there is evidence of a more recent 3 He input in the sample. However, the Los Azufres geothermal system has a 3 He input from rocks that are even younger (1.5 x 105 years). This suggests that Los Azufres may have a more recent 3 He input than Araro-Simirao.

Lake heatwaves under climate change	NATURE												Lake ecosystems, and the organisms that live within them, are vulnerable to temperature change(1-5), including the increased occurrence of thermal extremes(6). However, very little is known about lake heatwaves-periods of extreme warm lake surface water temperature-and how they may change under global warming. Here we use satellite observations and a numerical model to investigate changes in lake heatwaves for hundreds of lakes worldwide from 1901 to 2099. We show that lake heatwaves will become hotter and longer by the end of the twenty-first century. For the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5), the average intensity of lake heatwaves, defined relative to the historical period (1970 to 1999), will increase from 3.7 +/- 0.1 to 5.4 +/- 0.8 degrees Celsius and their average duration will increase dramatically from 7.7 +/- 0.4 to 95.5 +/- 35.3 days. In the low-greenhouse-gas-emission RCP 2.6 scenario, heatwave intensity and duration will increase to 4.0 +/- 0.2 degrees Celsius and 27.0 +/- 7.6 days, respectively. Surface heatwaves are longer-lasting but less intense in deeper lakes (up to 60 metres deep) than in shallower lakes during both historic and future periods. As lakes warm during the twenty-first century(7,8), their heatwaves will begin to extend across multiple seasons, with some lakes reaching a permanent heatwave state. Lake heatwaves are likely to exacerbate the adverse effects of long-term warming in lakes and exert widespread influence on their physical structure and chemical properties. Lake heatwaves could alter species composition by pushing aquatic species and ecosystems to the limits of their resilience. This in turn could threaten lake biodiversity(9) and the key ecological and economic benefits that lakes provide to society.

This hydrothermal activity as well as two newly discovered sites, Luhanga and Mbemvi, have been investigated by scuba divers during the multinational (France, Germany, Zaire, Burundi) and multidisciplinary (structural geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, microbiology) TANGANYDRO Expedition (28 August-12 October, 1991). This paper presents the main field results of the TANGANYDRO Project on the North Tanganyika hydrothermal sites, and comparisons with data obtained during the 1987 field work. The Pemba and Luhanga sites are located along the seismically active Uvira Border Fault. Two wide bubble fields and eleven active vents of varying morphologies have been observed at Pemba down to a water depth of 46 m, with fluids pouring out at a temperature of 53-88-degrees-C. These sites are located at the intersection of N120-140-degrees Precambrian cleavage and N45-50-degrees open fractures. N120-degrees-trending veins of massive sulphides (pyrite and marcasite) up to 0.70 m wide associated with these vents have been found locally. Methane and heavier hydrocarbon gases have been identified in the Pemba fluids. Fossil hydrothermal activity was also recognized on land. Fifteen km north of Pemba, the new discovered site of Luhanga has shown 10 active vents and some small bubble fields between 3 and 6 m water depth. Fluid temperature is 50-54-degrees-C. There, vents are located at the intersection of N20-30-degrees sinistral strike-slip faults and an E-W twisted Precambrian cleavage. At Cape Banza, seventy-two vents or groups of vents have been identified down to a water depth of 6 m, along a N-S trending, 200 m long belt. These vents are characterized by aragonite chimneys with varying sizes and morphologies. Sulphide mineralization (pyrite) has been found on the walls of fractures and pipes through which the hydrothermal fluid passes. Temperatures between 66 and 103-degrees-C have been measured. Methane and heavier hydrocarbon gases have also been identified in the Cape Banza fluids. The Mbemvi site, located in Burton's Bay, has shown five active vents between 6 and 10 m water depth. Fluids pour out through sediments at a temperature of 60-degrees-C. Attention has also been devoted to some subaerial sites belonging to the northern Tanganyika structural system in Zaire (Mashuzi) and Burundi (Kabezi and Ruhwa). Possible relationships between heat flow anomalies, regional volcanism, neotectonics and hydrothermal activity are discussed.																			0396-2687					JUN 24	1992	16	1					55	81																WOS:A1992JC73000006

The results reveal that hydrodynamics has remarkable effects on nutrient fluxes in this area. With a bottom wave stress of 0.019 N m(-2) (equivalent to disturbance caused by wind SE 5-7 m s(-1) at the sediment sample site of Meiliang Bay), the fluxes of TN, TDN and NH4+-N were separately 1.92 X 10(-3), -1.81 X 10(-4) and 5.28 X 10(-4) Mg m(-2) s(-1)(positive for upward and negative for downward), but for TP, TDP and SRP, the fluxes were 5.69 X 10(-4), 1.68 X 10(-4) and -1.29 X 10(-4) mg m(-2) s(-1). In order to calculate the released amount of nutrients based on these results, statistic analysis on the long-term meteorological data was conducted. The result shows that the maximum lasting time for wind SE 5-7 m s(-1) in this area is about 15 h in summer. Further calculation shows that 111 t TN, 32 t NH4+-N, 34 t TP and 10 t TDP can be released into water (the sediment area was 47.45% of the whole surface area), resulting in concentration increase of 0.025, 0.007, 0.007 and 0.002 mg L-1 separately. With stronger disturbance (bottom wave stress is 0.217 N m(-2) which is equivalent to disturbance caused by wind SE 10 - 11 m s(-1) at the same site), there has been significant increase of nutrient fluxes (1.16 X 10(-2), 6.76 X 10(-3), 1.14 X 10(-2) and 2.14 X 10(-3) mg m(-2) s(-1) for TN, DTN and NH4+-N and TP). The exceptions were TDP with flux having a decrease (measured to be 9.54 X 10(-5) mg m(-2) s(-1)) and SRP with flux having a small increase (measured to be 5.42 X 10(-5) mg m(-2) s(-1)). The same statistic analysis on meteorological data reveal that the maximum lasting time for wind SE 10-11 m s(-1) is no more than 5 h. Based on the nutrient fluxes and the wind lasting-time, similar calculations were also made suggesting that 232 t TN, 134.9 t TDN, 228 t NH4+-N, 42.7 t TP, 2.0 t TDP and 1.1 t SRP will be released from sediment at this hydrodynamic condition resulting in the concentration increases of 0.050, 0.029, 0.049, 0.009, 0.0004 and 0.0002 mg L-1. Therefore in shallow lakes, surface disturbance can lead to significant increase of nutrient concentrations although some components in water column had negative flux with weak disturbance (e.g. TDN and SRP in this experiment). In this case, sediment looks to be a source of nutrients. These nutrients deposited in sediment can be carried or released into water with sediment resuspension or changes of environmental conditions at water-sediment interface, which can have great effects on aquatic ecosystem and is also the characteristics of shallow lakes.																			1006-9313					APR	2006	49			1			186	192		10.1007/s11430-006-8118-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-006-8118-4													WOS:000238958400018

In the work, the most general definition of temperature was discussed and presented, the temporal probability distribution of air temperature was analyzed and evaluated. Temperature has no specific definition. Thus it will be difficult to study the nature of any geophysical phenomena, including the characteristics of temperature distribution, without understanding the modern scientific definition and adjustment of temperature.The aim of the work is to give the most modern reasonable definition of temperature or what the thermometer measures, the answer to which requires a more specific scientific justification, as well as to evaluate the patterns of possible spatiotemporal distribu-tion of air temperature in the territory of Armenia and in the area of the Lake Sevan basin.Methods. To solve the set tasks, the authors used corresponding research and published works as a theoretical basis in the work. In the work, the average monthly data of actual observations of the temperature of the ground surface air layer and the amount of precipitation of the & DLANGBRAC;Center for Hydrometeorology and Monitoring & drangbrac; SNCO of the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Armenia were used. It was found that temperature is a quantity characterizing the thermal state and radiation of the terrestrial and celestial bodies and, in general, the environment, which is strongly related to the entropy change of the system; temperature is the main thermodynamic characteristic of thermal equilibrium; the thermodynamic and microscopic concepts of temperature coincide; the tem-perature-heat (energy) difference becomes known in the sense that a system can have high energy but low temperature. The authors applied the following research methods in the article: mathematical and statistical, extrapolation, analysis, analogy, correlation, cartographic. Results. Energy depends on the geometry (dimensions) of the system, but temperature does not. A trend of increasing air tem-perature is observed in the RA territory, which is also a result of the entropy change of the system. It can change very quickly, depending on the environmental factors in the given area (the growth rate of greenhouse farms, the artificial filling of valleys, which are wave carriers of air flow, the relentless use of green spaces for the purpose of public buildings, and other factors) in the process of disrupting the excessively permissible norms, which are currently separate needs serious research and prevention.The long-term variability of surface air temperature in the area of the Lake Sevan basin is analyzed. The analysis carried out made it possible to give a quantitative assessment characterizing the climate change in this region over the past 98 years. An analysis of the observational data showed that the trend of climate warming is confirmed by an increase in air temperature both in winter and over a long period of time. The change in surface air temperature occurs at a rate of 0.002 & DEG;C/year to 0.012 & DEG;C/year and is generally 0.008 & DEG;C/year (or 0.08 & DEG;C/10 years) for all analyzed stations. The results obtained confirm the presence of two periods of warming observed in 1927-1970 and 1971-2021. All the results obtained in the course of the work testify to the trend of climate mitigation in the area of the Lake Sevan basin at the end of the 20th -beginning of the 21st century.					; Reshetchenko, Svitlana/JSL-6490-2023; Varduhi, Margaryan/AAT-7859-2020; Dmitriiev, Sviatoslav/LFV-5270-2024	Margaryan, Varduhi/0000-0003-3498-0564; Dmitriiev, Sviatoslav/0000-0001-9256-6455; Resetcenko, Svitlana/0000-0003-0744-4272; Sedrakyan, Armen/0000-0003-2166-3754													2410-7360	2411-3913					2023		58					231	240		10.26565/2410-7360-2023-58-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.26565/2410-7360-2023-58-18													WOS:001059467000005
J	BJORLYKKE, K				BJORLYKKE, K			FLUID-FLOW IN SEDIMENTARY BASINS	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The pore waters in sedimentary basins are ultimately derived from sea water, meteoric water, mineral bound water, or from the underlying basement. Geochemically these waters initially have different signatures; however, the pore water compositions are easily altered by reactions with minerals or by mixing with other fluids. Meteoric water is driven downwards into sedimentary basins by the gravitational potential, which approximately corresponds to the elevation of the ground water table above the sea or lake level. It is difficult to model such flow, however, because the permeability on a large scale is almost impossible to represent realistically. The continuity of confined sandstone and limestone aquifers plays an important role in determining the flux of meteoric water received by rocks in different parts of the basin, but this is again difficult to predict. Pore water flow driven by compaction typically has velocities several orders of magnitude lower than what is commonly found in meteoric water flow regimes. The average rate of upwards flow is lower than the rate of subsidence and the difference is the rate of incorporation of sea water in the topmost layer at the sea floor. The salinity of formation water provides important constraints on fluid flow in sedimentary basins. In the North Sea Basin and the Gulf Coast Basin, these types of data indicate that vertical mixing by compaction-driven flow and convection is limited. Compaction-driven flow obeys Darcy's Law but there are complex interdependencies between pressure, permeability and compaction. Given the low compressibility of water, the flow which can result from pressure release alone is very limited, except on a local scale along permeable faults and fractures. The main flow of pore water during burial is driven by compaction, which is a slow process, even when overpressure is released abruptly with a resulting increase in the net effective stress. In the case of high permeability faults, the flow into the fault from low permeability sedimentary rocks at depth may be rate-limiting. The displacement of pore water in adjacent sediments near the top of the faults may also slow down fluid flow on fractures that do not reach the sea floor. Modelling of fluid flow in sedimentary basins should be based on permeability distributions which are mostly determined by primary facies, diagenesis and the tectonic history of the basin. Extensional tectonics produce a predominantly vertical fracture network which may serve as conduits for pore water flowing deep into the crust. Upward flow of hot fluids in basement fractures must have a high velocity in order to produce large thermal anomalies. Concentrations of dissolved components precipitate at the surface and form deposits of quartz and ore minerals. If basement fractures are overlain by a thick sequence of soft sediments, the rate of flow on the fractures will be reduced because of the low permeability in the sedimentary cover, and conductive heat transport will dominate. Flow of water at high enough velocities to bring hot water to the surface and produce hot springs is most likely to occur in fractured basements rocks or well-cemented sedimentary rocks. Concentrated precipitation of dissolved components will occur near the surface, where the rate of cooling is highest. Also, sediment-hosted ores precipitated from flow of hot water on fractures are therefore likely to form before accumulation of thick overlying sedimentary sequences.																			0037-0738					JUL	1993	86	1-2					137	158		10.1016/0037-0738(93)90137-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(93)90137-T													WOS:A1993LT83800008

A review on environmental monitoring of water organic pollutants identified by EU guidelines	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												The contamination of fresh water is a global concern. The huge impact of natural and anthropogenic organic substances that are constantly released into the environment, demands a better knowledge of the chemical status of Earth's surface water. Water quality monitoring studies have been performed targeting different substances and/or classes of substances, in different regions of the world, using different types of sampling strategies and campaigns. This review article aims to gather the available dispersed information regarding the occurrence of priority substances (PSs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) that must be monitored in Europe in surface water, according to the European Union Directive 2013/39/EU and the Watch List of Decision 2015/495/EU, respectively. Other specific organic pollutants not considered in these EU documents as substances of high concern, but with reported elevated frequency of detection at high concentrations, are also discussed. The search comprised worldwide publications from 2012, considering at least one of the following criteria: 4 sampling campaigns per year, wet and dry seasons, temporal and/or spatial monitoring of surface (river, estuarine, lake and/or coastal waters) and ground waters. The highest concentrations were found for: (i) the PSs atrazine, alachlor, trifluralin, heptachlor, hexachlorocyclohexane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; (ii) the CECs azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diclofenac, 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, imidacloprid and 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate; and (iii) other unregulated organic compounds (caffeine, naproxen, metolachlor, estriol, dimethoate, terbuthylazine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, ketoprofen, atenolol, Bisphenol A, metoprolol, carbofuran, malathion, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine and ofloxacin). Most frequent substances as well as those found at highest concentrations in different seasons and regions, together with available risk assessment data, may be useful to identify possible future PS candidates.

J	Joeckel, RM; Diffendal, RF				Joeckel, RM; Diffendal, RF			Geomorphic and environmental change around a large, aging reservoir: Lake C. W. McConaughy, Western Nebraska, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Lake C. W. McConaughy, a 63-year-old manmade reservoir in the North Platte Valley of western Nebraska, is the largest standing body of water in the state. From the time that Kingsley Dam was completed in 1941 until the present day (2004), many geomorphic and environmental changes have occurred along the shores and within the North Platte Valley. Erosion on the southeastern shoreline of the lake had been perceived as a problem for landowners and managers for at least three decades, but the full scale of erosion was revealed only after a cumulative 18-m drawdown in lake level: bedrock platforms, extending from cliffs on headlands, as well as minor caves, alcoves, potholes, and beach erosion scarps were revealed. Actual headland retreat since 1941 has probably been on a scale of magnitude of tens of meters. Erosional platforms, however, are as much as 266 in in length, indicating that they are, collectively, the results of a combination of pre-reservoir geomorphic conditions, erosion during reservoir filling, and wave erosion after filling. Serial observations of the shoreline made in the period 1999-2002 demonstrated that shoreline erosion continues. Depositional features such as pocket beaches and beach ridges have formed de novo, in bays between headlands. Also, a delta that prograded at least 4 kin from the North Platte River into the lake between 1952 and 1993 continues to grow, and major morphometric changes have occurred on the North Platte River immediately upstream since 1941 in response to the elevation of the local base level by the lake; most of the change in channel patterns in the river upstream from the delta took place in a mere 8 years from 1952 to 1960. Since 1999, some emergent beaches and areas of exposed lake floor have developed sand dunes; eolian erosion and re-deposition is widespread elsewhere in these areas during periods of high winds, which are frequent in western Nebraska. The water table beneath lands adjacent to the reservoir generally rose until 1953 as the lake was filling. The far-flung irrigation system of which Lake McConaughy is the key element has elevated water tables as far as 250 kin from the lake. Since at least 2000, soil salinization (episodic thenardite accumulation) has developed in exposed lake sediments at the western end of the lake. On a smaller scale, groundwater has been discharging lakeward along shoreline beach scarps through springs and seeps while lake levels have been low. Slightly lowering the operating level of Lake McConaughy could slow some of the more dramatic effects of shoreline erosion when the lake returns to its pre-drought volume, but erosion will continue, particularly at the ends of headlands on the southeastern shore, which are exposed to strong waves driven by northerly to northwesterly winds. Eolian erosion and re-deposition will, on the other hand, continue as long as lake level remains particularly low as a result of drought and the removal of irrigation waters. Salinization can be considered an ephemeral phenomenon, dependent on future management of the lake, but it indirectly represents the potential for larger-scale changes in hydrogeologic systems. The longer-term effects of lake-related water-table changes, both near the lake and downstream in irrigated lands, as well as the ability of the lake to supply irrigation water if drought conditions continue, remain to be seen.

New geochemical data are presented for bulk-rocks, matrix glasses, melt inclusions and minerals from the 1835 deposits and a pre-1835 basaltic andesite tephra, with the aim of shedding light on the magmatic processes and associated timescales that led to the eruption. Our results reveal that the 1835 eruption was fed by a compositionally and thermally zoned magma reservoir situated similar to 4 km (P-H2O similar to 100 MPa) beneath the volcano. Small volumes of crystal-poor dacite (< 10 wt % phenocrysts, 63 center dot 8-64 center dot 8 wt % SiO2, similar to 950A degrees C) and silicic andesite (< 10 wt % phenocrysts, 62 center dot 2 wt % SiO2, 960-1010A degrees C) were erupted first, followed by relatively crystal-rich andesite (15-30 wt % phenocrysts, 57 center dot 4-58 center dot 8 wt % SiO2, 960-1010A degrees C), which accounts for similar to 90% of the erupted magma. The pre-1835 basaltic andesite (similar to 20 wt % phenocrysts, 52 center dot 4 wt % SiO2, 1110-1170A degrees C) represents a mafic end-member for Cosiguina. The major and trace element compositions of the bulk-rocks, melt inclusions and matrix glasses suggest that (1) the pre-1835 basaltic andesite is a plausible parent for the 1835 magmas, (2) the 1835 andesite bulk-rocks do not represent true melts, but instead mixtures of silicic andesite liquid and a component of accumulated crystals dominated by plagioclase, and (3) the silicic andesite and dacite formed from the andesite magma through liquid extraction followed by fractional crystallization. Observed bimodal to trimodal crystal populations are consistent with a multi-stage, polybaric differentiation process, with calcic plagioclase (An(75-90), An(90-95)) and magnesian clinopyroxene (Mg# = 67-75), plus olivine and magnetite, forming from mafic andesite, basaltic andesite and basalt in the lower crust. The calcic plagioclase exhibits sieve textures, which may be the result of H2O-undersaturated decompression during magma ascent to the upper crust; An(50-65) plagioclase lacking a sieve texture, orthopyroxene (Mg# = 61 and 63-72), clinopyroxene (Mg# = 67), magnetite and apatite crystallized from andesite to dacite liquids in the shallow magma reservoir. An(75-90) plagioclase comprising entire phenocrysts or cores with An(50-65) rims in the 1835 magmas is cognate from earlier stages of differentiation and shows evidence of extensive diffusion of Mg when compared with similar An(75-95) crystals hosted in the pre-1835 basaltic andesite. Using plagioclase-melt Mg partitioning and modelling of the Mg diffusion process, we constrain the residence time of these crystals in the silicic liquids to more than 100 years and less than 2000 years, with detailed analysis of three crystals yielding similar to 400 years. We propose that magma reservoir zonation occurred on timescales of 10(2)-10(3) years at Cosiguina. The occurrence of H2O-rich fluid inclusions in all 1835 samples and volatile element systematics in melt inclusions imply that the magmas were saturated with a vapour phase (H2O, S, +/- CO2) during much of their evolution in the upper crust. Accumulation of free gas at the top of the magma reservoir may have led to overpressurization of the system, triggering the eruption. Catastrophic release of this exsolved vapour and syn-eruptive devolatilization of the melt injected several teragrams of S into the atmosphere. Our data, coupled with independent evidence from ice cores and tree rings, indicate that the Cosiguina eruption had a sizeable atmospheric impact comparable with or larger than that of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. Stratigraphic evidence shows that Cosiguina has produced > 15 compositionally zoned explosive eruptions in the past, suggesting that similar future eruptions are likely. The products of the 1835 eruption of Cosiguina share many features with compositionally zoned eruptive sequences elsewhere, such as the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama, the ad 79 'Pompei' eruption of Vesuvius and the 1912 eruption of Novarupta-Katmai.

J	Tarasova, VN; Androsova, V; Sonina, A				Tarasova, Viktoria N.; Androsova, Vera, I; Sonina, Angella, V			LI.HENS OF THE NATIONAL PARK "VODLOZERSKY", RUSSIA	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Based on long-term (> 25 years) data analysis, the species diversity of lichens of the largest (4683 km(2)) Protected Area in Northwest Russia, the National Park "Vodlozersky", is presented for the first time. The National Park "Vodlozersky" was established in 1991 to preserve unique natural communities in the basin of Lake Vodlozero and the River Ileksa. The territory of the Protected Area is located along the eastern borders of the Fennoscandian Shield in two administrative regions: the Republic of Karelia and the Arkhangelsk region. This study is the first attempt to generalise all available data on the lichen flora of NP "Vodlozersky". The paper summarises the information from literature and the authors' data on lichen species diversity obtained in 19 expeditions to different parts of the National Park "Vodlozersky" over a 30-year period of study. Field material was collected by combination of floristic (route methods) and geobotanical studies - by the methods of establishing and description of sample plots ranging in size from 400 to 10 000 m(2). For a detailed study of the species composition of lichens in the sample plots, all types of substrates were examined: the trunks and branch surface of different tree species under various conditions (living, falling, dead wood), as well as rotting wood, soil and stones. The collection of lichens (565 herbarium specimens) from the National Park "Vodlozersky" deposited in the herbarium of the Helsinki University (H) (H) were revised. A brief history of the lichen study in the Protected Area was described and the dynamics of the accumulation of information on the species diversity of lichens and allied fungi was revealed by years, from 170 species in 1991 to 469 species and 4 subspecies in 2020. The recent studies resulted in a list of 30 new findings, including 13 species for the Karelian part, and 17 for the whole area of the National Park "Vodlozersky". A total of 473 taxa are reported for the National Park "Vodlozersky", including 445 species and 4 subspecies of lichens, 11 species of non-lichenised fungi and 13 species of lichenicolous fungi. The distribution of lichen species number between the two parts of the Protected Area belonging to different regions of the Russian Federation is as follows: 327 are registered on the Karelian territory of the National Park "Vodlozersky", 402 species on the Arkhangelsk part; the number of common species is 259. Among the recorded lichens in the National Park "Vodlozersky" 18 species are listed in the Red Data Book of the Republic of Karelia and 16 species are in the Red Data Book of the Arkhangelsk Region. The obtained data indicate the high potential of the Protected Area in preserving and maintaining the general diversity of lichen species. The number of species found in the Arkhangelsk part of the National Park "Vodlozersky" is 64% of the currently known lichen diversity for the mainland of the Arkhangelsk region. In the Karelian part there are 25% species of lichens known for the Republic of Karelia. The authors emphasise the publication scarcity of accumulated material on the lichen flora of National Park "Vodlozersky", which makes the study relevant.

J	Nathenson, M; Bacon, CR; Ramsey, DW				Nathenson, Manuel; Bacon, Charles R.; Ramsey, David W.			Subaqueous geology and a filling model for Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Results of a detailed bathymetric survey of Crater Lake conducted in 2000, combined with previous results of submersible and dredge sampling, form the basis for a geologic map of the lake floor and a model for the filling of Crater Lake with water. The most prominent landforms beneath the surface of Crater Lake are andesite volcanoes that were active as the lake was filling with water, following caldera collapse during the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama 7700 cal. yr B.P. The Wizard Island volcano is the largest and probably was active longest, ceasing eruptions when the lake was 80 m lower than present. East of Wizard Island is the central platform volcano and related lava flow fields on the caldera floor. Merriam Cone is a symmetrical andesitic volcano that apparently was constructed subaqueously during the same period as the Wizard Island and central platform volcanoes. The youngest postcaldera volcanic feature is a small rhyodacite dome on the east flank of the Wizard Island edifice that dates from 4800 cal. yr B.P. The bathymetry also yields information on bedrock outcrops and talus/debris slopes of the caldera walls. Gravity flows transport sediment from wall sources to the deep basins of the lake. Several debris-avalanche deposits, containing blocks up to 280 m long, are present on the caldera floor and occur below major embayments in the caldera walls. Geothermal phenomena on the lake floor are bacterial mats, pools of solute-rich warm water, and fossil subaqueous hot spring deposits. Lake level is maintained by a balance between precipitation and inflow versus evaporation and leakage. High-resolution bathymetry reveals a series of up to nine drowned beaches in the upper 30 m of the lake that we propose reflect stillstands subsequent to filling of Crater Lake. A prominent wave-cut platform between 4 m depth and present lake level that commonly is up to 40 m wide suggests that the surface of Crater Lake has been at this elevation for a very long time. Lake level apparently is limited by leakage through a permeable layer in the northeast caldera wall. The deepest drowned beach approximately corresponds to the base of the permeable layer. Among a group of lake filling models, our preferred one is constrained by the drowned beaches, the permeable layer in the caldera wall, and paleoclimatic data. We used a precipitation rate 70% of modern as a limiting case. Satisfactory models require leakage to be proportional to elevation and the best fit model has a linear combination of 45% leakage proportional to elevation and 55% of leakage proportional to elevation above the base of the permeable layer. At modern precipitation rates, the lake would have taken 420 yr to fill, or a maximum of 740 yr if precipitation was 70% of the modern value. The filling model provides a chronology for prehistoric passage zones on postcaldera volcanoes that ceased erupting before the lake was filled.

Some permafrost distribution maps have been compiled but, due to limited data sources, ambiguous criteria, inadequate validation, and deficiency of high-quality spatial data sets, there is high uncertainty in the mapping of the permafrost distribution on the TP. We generated a new permafrost map based on freezing and thawing indices from modified Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperatures (LSTs) and validated this map using various ground-based data sets. The soil thermal properties of five soil types across the TP were estimated according to an empirical equation and soil properties (moisture content and bulk density). The temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model was applied to simulate the permafrost distribution. Permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, and unfrozen ground covered areas of 1.06 x 10(6) km(2) (0.97-1.15 x 10(6) km(2), 90% confidence interval) (40 %), 1.46 x 10(6) (56 %), and 0.03 x 10(6) km(2) (1 %), respectively, excluding glaciers and lakes. Ground-based observations of the permafrost distribution across the five investigated regions (IRs, located in the transition zones of the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground) and three highway transects (across the entire permafrost regions from north to south) were used to validate the model. Validation results showed that the kappa coefficient varied from 0.38 to 0.78 with a mean of 0.57 for the five IRs and 0.62 to 0.74 with a mean of 0.68 within the three transects. Compared with earlier studies, the TTOP modelling results show greater accuracy. The results provide more detailed information on the permafrost distribution and basic data for use in future research on the Tibetan Plateau permafrost.					zhao, lin/M-9536-2018; SHENG, Yu/GXZ-8269-2022; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Wu, Tonghua/B-4202-2009; xie, Changwei/AAL-6165-2021; Cheng, Guodong/A-2996-2009; Wu, Tonghua/AAE-4563-2019	zhao, lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; Wu, Tonghua/0000-0002-5084-3570; Cheng, Guodong/0000-0002-2758-6211; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				NOV 8	2017	11	6					2527	2542		10.5194/tc-11-2527-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2527-2017													WOS:000414668800001

Worldwide alteration of lake mixing regimes in response to climate change	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Lakes hold much of Earth's accessible liquid freshwater, support biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services to people around the world. However, they are vulnerable to climate change, for example through shorter durations of ice cover, or through rising lake surface temperatures. Here we use a one-dimensional numerical lake model to assess climate change impacts on mixing regimes in 635 lakes worldwide. We run the lake model with input data from four state-of-the-art model projections of twenty-first-century climate under two emissions scenarios. Under the scenario with higher emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0), many lakes are projected to have reduced ice cover; about one-quarter of seasonally ice-covered lakes are projected to be permanently ice-free by 2080-2100. Surface waters are projected to warm, with a median warming across lakes of about 2.5 degrees C, and the most extreme warming about 5.5 degrees C. Our simulations suggest that around 100 of the studied lakes are projected to undergo changes in their mixing regimes. About one-quarter of these 100 lakes are currently classified as monomictic-undergoing one mixing event in most years- and will become permanently stratified systems. About one-sixth of these are currently dimictic-mixing twice per year- and will become monomictic. We conclude that many lakes will mix less frequently in response to climate change.

J	Liu, XH; Lu, SY; Guo, W; Xi, BD; Wang, WL				Liu, Xiaohui; Lu, Shaoyong; Guo, Wei; Xi, Beidou; Wang, Weiliang			Antibiotics in the aquatic environments: A review of lakes, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The potential threat of antibiotics to the environment and human health has raised significant concerns in recent years. The consumption and production of antibiotics in China are the highest in the world due to its rapid economic development and huge population, possibly resulting in the high detection frequencies and concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic environments of China. As a water resource, lakes in China play an important role in sustainable economic and social development. Understanding the current state of antibiotics in lakes in China is important. Closed and semi-closed lakes provide an ideal medium for the accumulation of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This review summarizes the current levels of antibiotic exposure in relevant environmental compartments in lakes. The ecological and health risks of antibiotics are also evaluated. This review concludes that 39 antibiotics have been detected in the aquatic environments of lakes in China. The levels of antibiotic contamination in lakes in China is relatively high on the global scale. Antibiotic contamination is higher in sediment than water and aquatic organisms. Quinolone antibiotics (QNs) pose the greatest risks. The contents of antibiotics in aquatic organisms are far lower than their maximum residual limits (MRLs), with the exception of the organisms in Honghu Lake. The lakes experience high levels of ARG contamination. A greater assessment of ARG presence and antibiotic exposure are urgent. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Plint, AG; Krawetz, JR; Buckley, RA; Vannelli, KM; Walaszczyk, I				Plint, A. Guy; Krawetz, Jessica R.; Buckley, Robin A.; Vannelli, Kathleen M.; Walaszczyk, Ireneusz			Tectonic, eustatic and climatic controls on marginal-marine sedimentation across a flexural depocentre: Paddy Member of Peace River Formation (Late Albian), Western Canada Foreland Basin	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												In north-central Alberta and adjacent British Columbia, clastic strata of the middle to late Albian Peace River and Shaftesbury formations were deposited in alluvial to shallow-marine environments across the foredeep of the Western Canada Foreland Basin. A high-resolution, log and core-based allostratigraphic framework for the Paddy Member of the Peace River Formation established nine allomembers, PA to PI, bounded by flooding surfaces and apparently equivalent non-marine surfaces. Within the estimated 2 Myr. duration of the Paddy, allomembers allow the evolving palaeogeography and changing relationship between accommodation and sedimentation rates to be analysed on time-steps on the order of 10(5) years. Paddy strata fill an arcuate depocentre ca 300 km wide, across which the rocks thin eastward from 125 m to ca 5 to 10 m. The northern part of the basin is occupied by muddy, offshore marine deposits that pass abruptly southward into a linear, WSW-ENE-trending body of sandstone deposited in a wave-dominated barrier-strandplain, at least 350 km long. Extending >200 km to the south of the strandplain was a region of shallow brackish to freshwater lagoons and lakes that graded to the SW into alluvial facies. Within the lagoon region, few-m thick, elongate and patchy sandstones represent river-dominated deltas. In allomembers PA to PG, these sandstones are concentrated in the west and south, implying supply from the western Cordillera. In allomembers PH and PI, sandstones are mainly in the east and have a distinctive, quartz-rich composition. They can be correlated eastward into the coeval Pelican Formation, and were sourced probably from the Canadian Shield on the opposite side of the basin. In the western foredeep, alluvial rocks comprise aggradational, unconfined floodplain deposits with ribbon sandstones, dissected, on at least nine separate levels, by palaeovalleys that are confined to the proximal foredeep. Valleys are 10 to 30m deep, few km wide, and filled with multi-storey channel-bars of pebbly coarse sandstone or conglomerate. Valleys cut down from well-developed interfluve palaeosols that record a falling and then rising water table. Alternating aggradation and degradation, and advance and retreat of the alluvial gravel front is attributed to cycles of varying rainfall intensity, rather than tectonism or eustasy. Apparently, coeval transgressive-regressive successions in the lagoon and marine regions are attributed to few-m scale eustatic changes. On the NE margin of the basin, tidal sandstone fills a northward-opening estuary cut on the basal Paddy unconformity. This sandstone contains the first well-documented specimens of Gnesioceramus comancheanus (Cragin), proving contemporaneity with at least part of the marine Joli Fou Formation to the east. Paddy allomembers change shape upward from short blunt wedges, through more acutely tapered wedges, to sheets. This change reflects initially rapid flexural subsidence, attributed to active thickening of the adjacent orogenic wedge. A waning rate of deformation permitted wider dispersal of sediment across the basin, driving broad isostatic subsidence beneath increasingly sheet-like rock bodies. A major hiatal surface, VE3, records non-deposition or subtle erosion attributed to erosional unloading and uplift of the adjacent orogen. A subsequent marine transgression is attributed to renewed thickening of the tectonic wedge that triggered deposition of marine mudstone that thickens westward from 0 to >110 m over 300 km. A postulated Milankovitch-band climatic control on both local gravel supply (via fluctuating rainfall), and shoreline movement (via ?Antarctic glacio-eustasy or groundwater storage), might account for cycles of alternating incision and aggradation in the alluvial realm. The same mechanism may also explain why shallow-marine units such as the Cretaceous Viking and Cardium formations contain abundant conglomerate in lowstand shoreface deposits (higher river discharge), yet have highstand shorelines dominated by sandstone (lower river discharge).

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED BUSINESS RESEARCH (ICABR 2013)					8th International Conference on Applied Business Research (ICABR)	APR 22-26, 2013	East London, SOUTH AFRICA	Mendel Univ Brno, Walter Sisulu Univ, Slovak Univ Agr Nitra, Kasetsart Univ				Tourism is a part of social life and is developing worldwide on a massive scale every year. Its dynamics is exceptional and brings significant gains to many countries. Slovakia has very good conditions for tourism development, i. e. and for his components - agrotourism and rural tourism. In addition to natural attraction such as mountains, caves, lakes, healing mineral springs, rich flora and fauna. The Slovak Republic also offers a valuable historical buildings and complexes, cultural monuments, castles, palaces, buildings of folk architecture, folk expressions, traditional crafts etc. Nowadays, rural tourism and agrotourism are becoming quite frequent terms, although rural tourism in Slovakia is relatively a new form of tourism in comparison with other countries. The recognition of cultural traditions, especially the specifics of individual regions of the world, is considered one of the most profitable industries. Global trend of mass tourism circumvent and Slovakia - the country although a small size, but rich in natural, cultural and historical features. Global trend of mass tourism also does not ignore Slovakia at all - it is a country with a small size but rich in natural, cultural and historical wealth. Rural tourism and agrotourism are put down for the future of the countryside as a stabilizing factor in economic and social development. Social and economic benefits can be included to the most important in rural tourism and agrotourism from which we can mention for instance: the improvement of infrastructure, development of small and medium-sized enterprises, improving income and others. Agrotourism in Slovakia can gradually subserves several basic goals such as maintaining the traditional rural settlements and the security of landscape and ecological functions, utilization of material base of farms and private farmers for the provision of agrotourism and not only to gain additional income but also using of the available material base of rural population. Rural tourism is a higher income for the village, possibilities to create job opportunities in the village, their revitalization and also improves the living standard of the population. Entrepreneurship in rural tourism has its own certain specificities. Engaging communities and businesses in tourism development is influenced by objectives pursued by both visitors and entrepreneurs. Visitors want to spend their vacation on extraordinary places, which are connected with nature and values. Countryside represents these values and also its own way of life, traditions and the beauty of countryside, connection to nature, implementation of physical activity to health care of family, especially children, full board etc. The entrepreneurs service providers must realize these values. Successful businesses in rural tourism quality are services for visitors. Therefore it is very important to know about the technology and ways to provide rural tourism services on required standard. Slovakia is one of the most rural countries of the Europe. The exact number of agricultural entities working with agrotourism and country tourism is unknown. Customers' requirements about a good countryside vacation should encourage the entrepreneurs in rural tourism to provide their facilities with additional services. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the position of the Slovak rural tourism and agrotourism based on the acquisition and processing of information in this field. Free available reports, materials and data published by Agricultural Paying Agency (PPA SR), professional publications, papers and other resources were used for processing this paper. To solve this problem, we used information, which were taken from the World Economic Forum and the Slovak Agency for Tourism.																					978-0-620-55419-0				2013							534	546																WOS:000337230600050

S. border with Mexico. We collected swallows during 1999 and 2000 from eight locations along the Rio Grande to determine if delta(15)N and delta(13)C values could be used to predict 1,1-di-(p-chlorophenyl-)2,2-dichloroethene (DDE) and selenium (Se) contaminant burdens in insectivorous birds nesting across a geographic gradient in the Texas Mexico border and to discern if stable isotopes could help discriminate between local versus nonlocal acquisition of contaminants. We analysed delta(15)N and delta(13)C in liver and muscle and DDE and Se in swallow carcasses. Within individuals, delta(15)N was higher in liver than in muscle of both species by an average of 1.34 parts per thousand, whereas delta(13)C was 0.145 parts per thousand higher in muscle than in liver. Significant differences occurred among locations in delta(15)N and delta(13)C values in liver and muscle of both species. Cave swallows from three locations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley were more enriched in delta(15)N than swallows from other sites. In general, swallows nesting in more northern latitudes along the Rio Grande had lower delta(15)N and delta(13)C values than those nesting farther south. Concentrations of DDE were significantly greater in swallows from El Paso, Llano Grande, and Pharr than in those from Brownsville, Falcon Lake, Laredo, Del Rio, and a reference site outside the Rio Grande. All swallows (n = 21) from El Paso, Llano Grande, and Pharr had DDE concentrations >= 3 mu g g(-1) wet weight (ww), a value three times greater than the estimated threshold in avian prey that could cause potential reproductive failures in raptors. Concentrations of Se also were significantly greater in El Paso and Del Rio than at other locations. Most Se concentrations were not of concern for direct effects on birds or their predators. Principal component analysis indicated some positive correlations between delta(15)N and delta(13)C values in tissues and contaminant concentrations in carcass; however, analysis of covariance suggested a stronger effect of location on concentrations of DDE and Se. At the local level (Llano Grande and Pharr) there was a significant positive correlation between delta(15)N in liver and DDE concentrations in swallow carcasses; however, Se concentrations were not significantly correlated with isotopes even at the local level. Our results provide a good database of delta(15)N and delta(13)C values for insectivorous birds nesting along the Rio Grande. Similar ecologies for cave and cliff swallows and their abundance and wide distribution along the Rio Grande make them ideal indicators of environmental pollution of this portion of the Texas-Mexico border.

J	Nichols, GE				Nichols, GE			The hemlock - white pine - northern hardwood region of Eastern North America	ECOLOGY												The region under consideration, centering around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence basin, lies between the northern conifer forest region to the north and the deciduous forest region to the south. The climatic climax forest comprises a mixture of evergreen coniferous and deciduous broad-leaf trees. Considered with reference to geographical distribution, these trees fall into 4 groups: (1) species whose centers of north-south distribution lie north of the region and which are widely distributed northward, being constituents of the northern conifer climax, namely, the balsam fir and white spruce; (2) species whose centers of north-south distribution lie within the region, whose range as a whole extends but little beyond it, and which are members of the climatic climax in no other region, notably the hemlock, eastern white pine, and yellow birch; (3) species whose centers of north-south distribution lie within the region or immediately south of it, but which range well to the south, there entering more or less into the composition of the deciduous forest climax, notably the sugar maple and basswood; (4) species whose centers of north-south distribution lie far to the south and which are widely distributed southward, as constituents of the deciduous forest climax, among others, the beech and white ash.. From an ecological standpoint this region has commonly been treated as a part of the northern conifer forest region, but it differs from this more especially in the comparatively minor importance in the climax of the trees of group 1, as above described. It is much more closely related to the deciduous forest region, which it particularly resembles in the prominence of the trees of groups 3 and 4 in the climax. Much may be said, however, in favor of treating this region as a distinct ecological unit, in itself. In addition to the climax species of group 2, numerous other trees and shrubs are prominent in the vegetation here which not only are more or less "endemic" but also are distinctive in their ecological characteristics. Also, various southern hardwoods are conspicuously absent here and, when present, tend to become replaced, in the course of succession, by hemlock and northern hard-woods. White pine is to be regarded as a normal, al-though minor, constituent of the climatic climax; but Norway pine is very doubtfully a member in any sense. Several physiographic climax types of forest are both of widespread occurrence and more or less peculiar to the region, of especial importance being the mixed forests of white pine and Norway pine, with or without jack pine, which constitute the so-called "pineries" of the lake states.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1935	16						403	422		10.2307/1930077	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930077													WOS:000200148500052
J	AULITZKY, H; HEUBERGER, H; PATZELT, G				AULITZKY, H; HEUBERGER, H; PATZELT, G			MOUNTAIN HAZARD GEOMORPHOLOGY OF TYROL AND VORARLBERG, AUSTRIA	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												This is a compound paper derived from the field guidebook prepared for the 1989 Salzburg Symposium on Mountain Hazard Geomorphology. It consists of seven separate parts, each prepared by one of the three co-authors. The first constitutes an introduction to the hazard geomorphology of the Tyrol and Vorarlberg, Austrian Alps. It provides outlines of the geology, tectonics, glacial history, topography, and present-day climate of the larger region within which the detailed field demonstrations of the excursion were set. Special attention is paid to the Otztal and its long history of natural disasters. The second part is a description of the Hall-Mils alluvial fan in the vicinity of Innsbruck. It provides a basis for understanding much of the Pleistocene and Holocene evolution of the Inn Valley terraces and alluvial fans, which are closely related to the development of the human settlements and the varying degree of hazard they sustain, depending upon their precise location. The details of the Enterbach torrent and alluvial fan are given the third section, with special attention to the 1969 debris flow disaster which destroyed 42 of the pre-existing 44 check-dams and caused US $1.8 million in damages to the village of Inzing and vicinity. Part four is an account of the giant landslide of Kofels that, about 8,700 years ago, collapsed into the Otztal between the sites of the present-day villages of Langenfeld and Umhausen. The earlier volcanic and meteorite impact hypotheses are reviewed and the current explanation of a giant landslide is presented. The force of the impact on the opposite valley wall was equivalent to a moderate-scale earthquake and the kinetic energy along the glide planes was sufficient to melt some of the underlying rock to create frictionite. The account of the 1987 Otztal flood disaster, as part five, demonstrates that mountain hazards remain a serious threat to this prime Alpine center of tourism and winter sports. Part six indicates that during the thirteenth, and seventeenth to nineteenth centuries the Otztal was even more hazardous than today. When the Gurgl and Vernagt glaciers extended to their historic maxima, ice-dammed lakes formed that periodically experienced catastrophic drainage and devastated the valley below them. The seventh and final article demonstrates how clear-cutting in the mountain forests of Schesa, near Bludenz, Voralberg, in the late-1770s, led to the development of an immense gully with recurrent disasters between the late-eighteenth century and the present. Taken together, these several parts combine studies in geology, geomorphology, and climatology, historical documentation, and the knowledge of the limited success of technical solutions, to demonstrate the complexity of mountain hazards research. They also demonstrate the need for caution, as well as sound legal basis, for human intervention in high energy mountain terrain.																			0276-4741					NOV	1994	14	4					273	305		10.2307/3673725	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3673725													WOS:A1994PX72900002

Five Great Tsunamis of the 20th Century as Recorded on the Coast of British Columbia	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The five great trans-Pacific tsunamis of the 20th century that occurred in 1946, 1952, 1957, 1960 and 1964 were accurately recorded by analogue tide gauges on the coast of British Columbia. All available pen-and-paper records of these events were collected, digitised, de-tided and analysed. The 1946 Aleutian Islands event was recorded at two stations, Tofino and Victoria, where maximum trough-to-crest tsunami wave heights were 55 and 27cm, respectively. These two gauged stations, as well as Prince Rupert, Alert Bay and Kitimat, also recorded the 1952 Kamchatka tsunami, which generated a maximum wave height of 77cm at Tofino. The 1957 Andreanof Islands tsunami was recorded at six primary stations and the 1960 Chile tsunami by 17 primary and temporary tide gauges. For both of these events, the maximum tsunami wave heights also occurred at Tofino: 48cm (1957) and 132cm (1960). The 1964 Alaska tsunami remains the strongest tsunami yet instrumentally recorded on the coast of British Columbia. Our examination of 16 records from this event shows that maximum wave heights at eight stations were higher than 1m, including Port Alberni (770cm), Ocean Falls (376cm), Tofino (237cm) and Alert Bay (222cm). We also find that the maximum wave at all stations for this event was among the first three waves. Subsequent wave heights rapidly attenuated following this group of waves. Frequency-time (f-t) analyses of the tsunami waveforms reveal that, for each station, the dominant frequencies of the waves and their evolution with time were very similar for different tsunamis, but differed considerably among sites for a particular tsunami, indicating the strong influence of local/regional topography on the incoming waves. From the latter point of view, the 1964 tsunami was exceptional. The epicentre of the 1964 Alaska earthquake was located much closer to the BC coast than for the other events and, therefore, the influence of the source was much stronger. The ringing of this tsunami was substantially shorter (<1.5days), the energy decay much faster, and the f-t diagrams at all sites more similar than for the other major events. During the 1964 event, energy associated with the dominant period of 2h rapidly decayed. All of the tsunamis examined penetrated deep inside the narrow channels, fjords and inlets, typical of the BC coast. Waves also propagated far into some of the rivers. The 1952 Kamchatka tsunami was recorded at Kitimat, located at the head of Kitimat Arm about 80km from Hecate Strait, while the 1957 Andreanof Islands tsunami was measured at Bella Coola, located at the remotest part of Burke Channel, a distance of 110km from the open ocean (Queen Charlotte Sound). The 1960 Chile tsunami was recorded at five stations located in the complex network of inlets and channels that make up the Seymour-Belize Inlet system on the central mainland coast of British Columbia, while the 1964 Alaska tsunami was observed at many stations in the Fraser River, including Pitt Lake that is connected to the Strait of Georgia through a 64-km route upstream in the Fraser and Pitt rivers. Our results further show that occasionally the fjords and inlets of the BC coast not only do not hinder the incoming waves but can strongly enhance them through resonant amplification. This was the case for the 1964 tsunami waves in Alberni Inlet, where the resonant response to the incoming waves resulted in severe damage to Port Alberni at the head of the inlet. The results of our analyses make it possible to isolate the tsunami signal and evaluate the principal parameters of tsunami waves. This, in turn, is of considerable value for three major problems: (1) Cataloguing of tsunami events; (2) estimation of the potential tsunami risk to the BC coast; and (3) verification and calibration of numerical tsunami models.

Solutions for initial-boundary-value problems representing gravity currents arising from variable inflow	STUDIES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS												In this article, we report on theoretical and numerical studies of models for suddenly initiated variable inflow gravity currents in rectangular geometry. These gravity currents enter a lighter, deep ambient fluid at rest at a time-dependent rate from behind a partially opened lock gate and their subsequent dynamics is modeled in the buoyancy-inertia regime using 1/2-layer shallow water theory. The resistance to flow that is exerted by the ambient fluid on the gravity current is accounted for by a front condition which involves a non-dimensional parameter that can be chosen in accordance with experimental observations. Flow filament theory is used to arrive at expressions for the variable inflow velocity under the assumptions of an inviscid and incompressible fluid moving through an opening of fixed area which is suddenly opened under a lock gate at one end of a large rectangular tank. The fluid in the lock is subjected to a (possibly) time varying pressure applied uniformly over its surface and the finite movement of the free surface is accounted for. Finding this time-dependent inflow velocity, which will then serve as a boundary condition for the solution of the shallow-water equations, involves solving forced non-linear ordinary differential equations and the form of this velocity equation and its attendant solutions will, in general, rule out finding self-similar solutions for the shallow-water equations. The existence of self-similar solutions requires that the gravity currents have volumes proportional to t (alpha) , where alpha >= 0 and t is the time elapsed from initiation of the flow. This condition requires a point source of fluid with very special properties for which both the area of the gap and the inflow velocity must vary in a related and prescribed time-dependent manner in order to preserve self-similarity. These specialized self-similar solutions are employed here as a check on our numerical approach. In the more natural cases that are treated here in which fluids flow through an opening of fixed dimensions in a container an extra dimensional parameter is introduced thereby ruling out self-similarity of the solutions for the shallow-water equations so that the previous analytical approaches to the variable inflow problem, involving the use of phase-plane analysis, will be inapplicable. The models developed and analyzed here are expected to provide a first step in the study of situations in which a storage container is suddenly ruptured allowing a heavy fluid to debouch at a variable rate through a fixed opening over level terrain. They also can be adapted to the study of other situations where variable inflow gravity currents arise such as, for example, flows of fresh water from spring run-off into lakes and fjords, flows from volcanoes and magma chambers, discharges from locks and flash floods.

Laboratory feasibility tests improve decision support for wetland eco-engineering; Lake Bartkow Lug (Poland) as test case	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Many lakes worldwide are exposed to high anthropogenic impacts including the influx of polluted surface water and groundwater, fish production and nutrient run-off from agriculture in the catchment. We selected the shallow Lake Bartkow Lug in Poland, receiving eutrophic River Chodelka water and currently used for fish farming as a case study for decision support with respect to inexpensive ways to improve water quality and facilitate higher biodiversity after fish stock removal. We selected four scenarios: (1) complete isolation from eutrophic water, (2) inflow of P-stripped surface water, (3) temporary water table drawdown, and (4) in-lake P sequestration. For financial reasons, dredging was not an option. The study started with an ecohydrological field survey to investigate the first scenario: isolation from river water inflow and restoration of the discharge of nutrient-poor, Fe-rich groundwater. Although groundwater appeared to be much less eutrophic, it contained low concentrations of Fe and high concentrations of SO42-, which would lead to higher risks of phosphate mobilization from the sediment. Moreover, local hydrology showed almost no discharge of groundwater with the exception of spring. To reduce the risk of failure and avoid high costs without benefits, we pre-tested the other three scenarios using small-scale laboratory experiments. The first experiment, which tested the effects of the influx of water stripped of P (scenario 2), showed that water quality would not improve due to high P-mobilization rates from the sediment to the water layer (internal eutrophication). We therefore investigated two alternative mitigation measures: temporary water table drawdown (scenario 3) and the addition of Fe (scenario 4), both in order to increase P-sorption in the sediment. Temporary lowering of the water table indeed decreased P-concentrations in pore water, but not in surface water because sediment Fe concentrations were insufficient. The addition of Fe to the sediment strongly improved water quality by P-sequestration leading to almost complete disappearance of P in both pore water and surface water. For the studied lake, successful improvement of the water quality and biodiversity can therefore only be achieved by scenario 4, internal P fixation, after the cessation of fish production. The removal of fish only will not lead to improvement, because of the strong mobilization of P in the sediment. We show that the combination of field research and small-scale laboratory feasibility tests strongly reduces the risks of failure, and avoids less efficient and more costly approaches based on trial and error in the field. We therefore recommend the inclusion of such tests in decision support systems for ecological engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reproductive potential of yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) in the conditions of lake ecosystems	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. (Nymphaeaceae Salisb.) belongs to the category of highly active cenose-forming plants in water bodies and water flows. The material for study of morphological peculiarities and seed productivity of the fruits of this species was collected mainly in the lake ecosystems of the Central Part of European Russia and Republic of Belarus. In the study we used biomorphological and ontogenetic approaches. Seed productivity was surveyed by direct count of number of seeds in the fruit. By abundance (in descending order), the significant reliable inter-lake differences in a number of morphological parameters of the fruit fall into the following sequence: number of rays of stigma of fruit (in six pairs of lakes) > length of fruit (in four pairs of lakes) > diameter of the stigma of fruit (in three pairs of lakes) > diameter of fruit (in two pairs of lakes) > length of the neck of the fruit (in one pair of lakes). Intra-regional differences in certain morphological parameters of fruits (by number of rays of stigmas) were most notably manifested only in the Belarus lakes which are similar by trophic status. All the differences in the fruits' morphology could be due to differences in the habitat by the amount of nutrients in water and soil. The amount of seed productivity of the fruits from N. lutea varies broadly. Analysis of this parameter depending on the character of soils in which the plants grew indicated reliable results only in the case of muddy (296 +/- 81) and sandy soils (179 +/- 13). We determined that distribution of generative diasporas of N. lutea across large distances is related not only to presence of floating ability in the seeds, but also the "multi-step" process of their release: first - mericarps from fruits, and then seeds from mericarps. In the experimental conditions, most seeds directly sunk to the bed (70%) and the rest continued to float on the surface of the water during a month. Low germination of the seeds of the water-lily in the laboratory conditions (4-6%) with use of different means and terms of dry stratification was due to the fact that they have an organic morphophysiological intermediate type of rest. Having such a mechanism causes portioned and prolonged germination, allowing the species to survive in non-favourable conditions and accumulate generative diaspores in the soil. Despite the fact that the initial stages of ontogenesis in the laboratory and natural conditions have no significant differences, we found polyvariance in their tempo of development. First of all, this is related to different dates of transition of the plant from one age state to another. In the case of N. lutea, one should also note the morphological polyvariance of ontogenesis related to change in morphologic characteristics of plants depending on the water level. The obtained results give a more complete picture of the peculiarities of generative reproduction of N. lutea, necessary for understanding the ecosystem role of this plant and its impact on biological processes in water bodies.

C	Kershaw, S; Guo, L		Pedley, HM; Carannante, G		Kershaw, Steve; Guo, Li			Pleistocene calcified cyanobacterial mounds, Perachora Peninsula, central Greece: a controversy of growth and history	COOL-WATER CARBONATES: DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS AND PALAEOENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS	Geological Society Special Publication				32nd International Geological Congress	AUG 20-28, 2004	Florence, ITALY					Pleistocene cyanobacterial mounds composed principally of fresh water branched cyanobacterium Rivularia haematites at the west end of Perachora Peninsula, eastern Gulf of Corinth, grew in water on an eroded terrace in a location where several fault systems converge near the triangular end of the peninsula, surrounded by deep water. Differential uplift due to faulting cut many mounds, which were eroded leading to eaves inside mounds. Cave-fill stratigraphy reveals subsequent marine submergence, then emergence, then final marine submergence which buried mounds in MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) Stage 5e marine corals and shells. Coralline algae comprising only the euryhaline species Lithophyllum pustulatum postdate the mound frame (between branches in the mounds, and as a previously undescribed pendent growth form with microbialites as cryptic biota in caves). The mound growth phase presents a conflict of interpretation between lacustrine and marine origins. Lacustrine interpretation is favoured by mound ecology (domination by fresh water cyanobacterium Rivularia haematites) when the Gulf of Corinth was a lake (MIS Stage 6 lowstand); and euryhaline coralline alga Lithophyllum pustulatum grew only after the R. haematites growth phase was complete, presumably when marine influence developed in early 5e. However, published evidence of geochemical signatures suggest the mounds grew in the MIS 5e sea during a phase of intense expulsion of carbonate- and calcium-rich groundwaters from local faults, which diluted the sea water sufficiently to permit calcification of R. haematites in a marine setting. That scenario requires coincidence of: location of the terrace in shallow water during 5e; calcification of a fresh water cyanobacterium during only the first 5e sea-level peak, ceased before the late 5e peak and was never repeated. Lacustrine interpretation requires nonmarine calcification, but also needs a subsequent relative lake-level fall to form caves before 5e marine flooding; sea-level fluctuations within 5e could be responsible for formation of cave fill before final burial. Both interpretations are influenced by uplift rates, with the published value of c. 0.3 mm a(-1) favouring the marine interpretation in Stage 5e. However, a lacustrine mound origin can be accommodated by a phase of rapid uplift in late Stage 6 to early Stage 5, then fluctuating sea-level in Stage 5e during slow uplift in a complex fault setting; after late Stage 6 to early Stage 5e, uplift rate slowed and the mounds were probably continuously exposed after 5e. For the lacustrine interpretation the debate continues about whether or not: (a) the marine-affinity geochemical signatures in R. haematites are due to alteration by 5e sea water; and (b) a variable uplift rate applies in this complex fault conjunction. However, the marine interpretation seems to require a powerful and sustained expulsion phase of groundwater across the entire end of Perachora Peninsula to dilute sea water sufficiently over a large area throughout the mound growth phase (possibly as much as 2000 years) to allow formation of the Rivularia mounds and exclude all marine biota, a phase that was stopped abruptly and not repeated. This is considered more difficult to accommodate and, therefore, pending further evidence, the non-marine interpretation is favoured.

Due to their gold-endowment, these greenstone belts have been the main focus of research and were interpreted to form in various tectonic settings involving back-arc basin, island arc or continental arc, and oceanic plateau. However, the TTG gneiss, as the dominant component of Archean crust, has received far less attention from the scrutiny of modern analytical methods than its counterpart, the mafic volcanics of the greenstone belts. Here, we present a comprehensive geochemical dataset including zircon U-Pb age, zircon Lu-Hf isotope results, as well as bulk-rock geochemical compositions and Sm-Nd isotopic analyses for TTG suites from the Katoro area in northwestern part of Tanzania. Zircon U-Pb dating for three TTG samples yielded 207Pb/206Pb ages of 2688 +/- 19 Ma, 2717 +/- 19 Ma and 2695 +/- 15 Ma, respectively, and the results fall within the peak crustal growth period in northern part of the Tanzania Craton. The Katoro TTGs have relatively high contents of SiO2 (70.77-74.69 %) and Na2O (4.74-5.16 %), high ratios of Sr/Y (59.49-167.25) and (La/Yb)N (17.27-50.72), but low MgO (0.24-0.70 %) and K2O (1.71-3.26 %) contents, low Nb/Ta ratios (8.50-16.60), and most of them belong to the trondhjemitic series rocks. They are characterized by strong enrichment of LILEs and LREEs with slightly positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*=1.05-1.38), but depleted in Nb-Ta and Ti, as well as heavy REEs and Y. They have positive epsilon Hf(t) values (average epsilon Hf(t) = +1.90 +/- 0.50 or + 2.07 +/- 0.33) and epsilon Nd(t) values (+1.19 to + 2.40) but lower than the contemporaneous depleted mantle, which is inconsistent with a subducting slab signature, and it is proposed that the Katoro TTGs most likely originated from partial melting of rutile-free, garnet-and amphibole-bearing lower mafic crust of an oceanic plateau. The results presented here suggest that the tectonic evolution in this part of Tanzania Craton needs to invoke a scenario in which crustal growth caused by subduction-related modification of an oceanic plateau.																			0301-9268	1872-7433				FEB	2023	385								106943	10.1016/j.precamres.2022.106943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2022.106943		DEC 2022											WOS:000917473800001
J	CAMERON, NG				CAMERON, NG			THE REPRESENTATION OF DIATOM COMMUNITIES BY FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGES IN A SMALL ACID LAKE	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The representative quality of fossil diatom assemblages in the recent sediment of a lake is compared with its contemporary diatom flora. In April 1986 experimental liming of the catchment of a small acidified lake, Loch Fleet (Galloway, U.K.), produced immediate changes in water quality. Lakewater pH rose from a mean of approximately 4.5 to 6.5, and in the two year period following liming a consistently higher pH was maintained. The marked response of diatom species to changing water quality provided a means of tracing events from living communities to the fossil assemblages. Diatom periphyton and plankton were sampled during a 20 month period and archived material was used to characterise earlier diatom communities. A comparison is made between living diatom communities and diatom assemblages collected by sediment traps and from sediment cores taken during the same period. Following liming, the diatom communities were found to respond within days or weeks to the changes in water quality. There is an initial change from acidobiontic communities, dominated by Tabellaria quadriseptata, to dominance by the acidophilous species Eunotia incisa and Peronia fibula. However, in the epipsammic community the acidobiontic species Tabellaria binalis fo, elliptica remains abundant after liming. Approximately one year after liming the abundances of species such as Achnanthes minutissima and Brachysira vitrea increase in the epilithon, epiphyton and epibryon, whilst in the epipsammon T. binalis fo. elliptica is replaced by small Eunotia spp. and Achnanthes altaica. During the latter part of 1987 and in 1988, despite a stable pH, fluctuating patterns of species abundances are seen in the epilithon, epiphyton and epibryon whilst the species composition of the epipsammon remains relatively stable. Spring blooms of the planktonic species Synedra acus and Asterionella formosa occur during 1988 and 1989 respectively. Sediment trapping, which began in April 1987, records shifts in species composition corresponding with those seen in the epilithon, epiphyton and epibryon and with the blooms of planktonic species. The signal from the smaller, and probably less easily transportable, epipsammic community is not so clearly discernible. Although the fundamental record of the sediment traps is one from living diatom communities, the appearance of taxa 'extinct' during the post-liming period reflects a low, but significant level of sediment resuspension. In contrast to the rapid response of living communities and their record in sediment traps, sediment cores do not begin to reflect changes in diatom composition until about 14 months after the initial liming. The first appearance of circumneutral taxa in significant abundance occurs only approximately 17 months after liming. The delayed reaction of sediment assemblages cannot be attributed principally to a slow rate of transport from the littoral to the profundal zone. Time-averaging processes within the sediment appear to be the main cause of the lag in core response. In contrast, blooms of planktonic species are quickly reflected in the stratigraphy of cores, but indicate that a considerable degree of downward mixing occurs. Comparison of the time trajectories of whole species assemblages in living communities, sediment traps and core surface sediments shows that the direction of change is similar in all three, but that the magnitude of change is attenuated in sediment assemblages.																			0921-2728					SEP	1995	14	2					185	223		10.1007/BF00735481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00735481													WOS:A1995RW10000006

Origin and evolution of silicic magmatism at Yellowstone based on ion microprobe analysis of isotopically zoned zircons	JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY												The origin of large-volume Yellowstone ignimbrites and smaller-volume intra-caldera lavas requires shallow remelting of enormous volumes of variably O-18-depleted volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks altered by hydrothermal activity. Zircons provide probes of these processes as they preserve older ages and inherited delta O-18 Values. This study presents a high-resolution, oxygen isotope examination of volcanism at Yellowstone using ion microprobe analysis with an average precision of +/-0.2 parts per thousand and a 10 mu m spot size. We report 357 analyses of cores and rims of zircons, and isotope profiles of 142 single zircons in 11 units that represent major Yellowstone ignimbrites, and post-caldera lavas. Many zircons from these samples were previously dated in the same spots by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP), and all zircons were analyzed for oxygen isotope ratios in bulk as a function of grain size by laser fluorination. We additionally report oxygen isotope analyses of quartz crystals in three units. The results of this work provide the following new observations. (1) Most zircons from post-caldera low-delta O-18 lavas are zoned, with higher delta O-18 values and highly variable U-Pb ages in the cores that suggest inheritance from pre-caldera rocks exposed on the surface. (2) Many of the higher-delta O-18 zircon cores in these lavas have U-Pb zircon crystallization ages that postdate caldera formation, but pre-date the eruption age by 10-20 kyr, and represent inheritance of unexposed post-caldera sub-volcanic units that have delta O-18 similar to the Lava Creek Tuff. (3) Young and voluminous 0.25-0.1 Ma intra-caldera lavas, which represent the latest volcanic activity at Yellowstone, contain zircons with both high-delta O-18 and low-delta O-18 cores surrounded by an intermediate-delta O-18 rim. This implies inheritance of a variety of rocks from high-delta O-18 pre-caldera and low-delta O-18 post-caldera units, followed by residence in a common intermediate-delta O-18 melt prior to eruption. (4) Major ignimbrites of Huckleberry Ridge, and to a lesser extent the Lava Creek and Mesa Falls Tuffs, contain zoned zircons with lower-delta O-18 Zircon cores, suggesting that melting and zircon inheritance from the low-delta O-18 lydrothermally altered carapace was an important process during formation of these large magma bodies prior to caldera collapse. (5) The delta O-18 zoning in the majority of zircon core-rim interfaces is step-like rather than smoothly inflected, suggesting that processes of solution-reprecipitation were more important than intracrystalline oxygen diffusion. Concave-downward zircon crystal size distributions support dissolution of the smaller crystals and growth Of rims on larger crystals. This study suggests that silicic magmatism at Yellowstone proceeded via rapid, shallow-level remelting of earlier erupted and hydrothermally altered Yellowstone source rocks and that pulses of basaltic magma provided the heat for melting. Each post-caldera Yellowstone lava represents an independent homogenized magma batch that was generated rapidly, by remelting of source rocks of various ages and delta O-18 values. The commonly held model of a single, large-volume, super-solidus, mushy-state magma chamber that is periodically reactivated and produces rhyolitic offspring is not supported by our data. Rather, the source rocks for the Yellowstone volanism were cooled below the solidus, hydrothermally altered by heated meteoric waters that caused low delta O-18 values, and then remelted in distinct pockets by intrusion of basic magmas. Each packet of new melt inherited zircons that retained older age and delta O-18 values. This inter relation may have significance for interpreting seismic data for crustal low-velociy zones in which magma mush and solidified areas experiencing hydrothermal circulation occur side by side. New basalt intrusions into this solidifying batholith are required to form the youngest volcanic rocks that erupted as independent rhyolitic magmas. We also suggest that the Lava Creek Tuff magma was already an uneruptable mush by the time of the first post-caldera eruption after 0.1 Myr of the climactic caldera-forming eruption.

J	Changnon, SA; Changnon, JM				Changnon, SA; Changnon, JM			History of the Chicago diversion and future implications	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The history of the Chicago diversion was analyzed to gather information for assessing the potential effects and responses to global climate warming and drying in the Great Lakes basin. The mix of social, economic, political, and climatic factors that created a series of national and international controversies over the diversion since 1896 was defined and is the subject of this review. Information was gathered using a literature survey and from experts in hydrology, law, economics, and political science. The historical analysis revealed that the events causing controversies fell within five distinct periods. The 1845-1890 period involved attempts to solve the sewage disposal problems of a rapidly growing Chicago. Polluted waters were being emitted into Lake Michigan causing a series of major typhoid epidemics, and in 1886 the city decided to build a large 45-km-long canal to divert lake water and flush the city's diluted sewage into the Illinois River system. During the 1891-1930 period increasing amounts of water diverted caused four major controversies: Chicago was pitted against Missouri, the federal government, the other states around the Great Lakes, and Canada. The 1931-1956 period had a federally-forced reduction of the diversion after prolonged debates in the U.S. Supreme Court. Illinois frequently attempted to get the diversion increased with controversies over each attempt, and the build-up of navigation in the canal and Illinois River created a new need for diverted water The 1957-1978 period had a major diversion controversy which went to the Supreme Court as a result of four factors: a temporary increase in the diversion to alleviate drought problems in the Mississippi River basin, the growth of Chicago's suburbs and their attendant demands for lake water, the demands for water by the development of more hydropower plants along the lakes' exit, and the opening of the Sr. Lawrence Seaway. This controversy was resolved in 1967, and Illinois found the Court's new guidelines unwieldy, ushering in the 1979-1994 period. The Supreme Court again handled the controversy over Illinois' request to change the accounting method for the water diverted. As this period ended in 1994, yet another controversy was brewing over federal claims that Illinois was exceeding the allotted diversion. The 100-year history of controversies over the Chicago diversion contains four lessons for the future. First, future social, economic and political forces affecting the use and control of the Great Lakes waters, both within and outside the basin, will change as both nations' political and economic worlds shift. Second, Chicago's ever continuing growth will lead to calls for more water from the lakes. Third a major change in climate would likely reduce water levels in the lakes, produce new demands for Great Lakes water and create major diversion controversies. Finally, controversies over the Chicago diversion, and other proposed diversions from the Great Lakes, seem a realistic forecast for the future, with or without a change in climate.																			0380-1330						1996	22	1					100	118		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70940-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70940-1													WOS:A1996UE69200013

Currently in the estuary, sedimentation is localized via sediment trapping particularly in the vicinity of the ETM, 13-26 km upstream from Battery Park (FBP) at the southern tip of Manhattan, in water depths greater than 4 m, and on the western side of the estuary. Data presented in this paper are from cores located within the segment of the estuary 29-50 km FBP. Age constraints are provided by C-14 dating. Paleoenvironmental interpretations are based upon paleosalinity estimates, gain size variability, and sedimentary structures. Paleosalinity was inferred on the basis of foraminiferal biofacies analysis and a new method for estimating summertime paleosalinity using oxygen isotope measurements in bivalve shell material. The isotopic analysis of a narrow size fraction (1.0-1.7 mm) representing summer growth of a single bivalve species (Gemma gemma) reduces the uncertainty related to annual changes in temperature. Data from similar to 45 km FBP indicate a gradual decrease in summertime paleosalinity between 6.4 and 2.0 ka from 25-20parts per thousand to 15-10parts per thousand (the latter is similar to present-day values). These results are consistent with the conclusion of an earlier low-resolution study. Sedimentation rates are generally low and are similar to the rate of sea-level rise in the Hudson River. Lowest sedimentation rates are noted in short (<2 m) cores from north of the Tappan Zee Bridge (40-50 km FBP from 2.4 ka to present); in shallow water (similar to 2 m at mean low water, core SD-11) similar to 45 km FBP; and on the eastern side of the estuary from similar to 50 to 29 km FBP. Exceptions are high sedimentation rates (up to four times background) observed in cores from the western flats (SD 30, similar to 45 km FBP, 4.9 to 3.4 ka) in water depths of 4 m and from the western part of the main channel (P21.7 core, similar to 32 km FBP, >23 to similar to 1.3 ka). We hypothesize that the observed pattern in sediment accumulation relates to a location for the ETM some 20 km upstream of its present position at 3 ka. Downstream migration of the ETM since 3 ka is ascribed to shoaling of the estuary, effectively squeezing the marine saltwater wedge in the same direction, and off marginal flats into the channel. Such shoaling would have enhanced the role of waves in mixing marine and fresher surface water, and reduced the effect of the ETM in focusing sediment accumulation. The results of this study are consistent with the idea that at any time, estuarine sedimentation is highly localized, suggesting a more complex depositional pattern than previously indicated in estuarine stratigraphic models.

The importance of the last deglacial lies in the fact that it was the most recent geological warming, and elevating our understanding of the warming may thus be helpful in prescribing the future warming scenarios. The importance of the Holocene lies in the fact the projected future warming is occurring under the climatic boundary conditions that are the natural extensions of the Holocene ones. In order to depict the spatiotemporal variations in the strength of East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) since the last deglacial with a focus on the Holocene dynamic patterns of EASM, we analyzed pollen assemblages and sedimentological indicators (Grain size, CaCO3 and TOC) of a lacustrine-wetland section in the Mianchi Basin (namely MC-1 section) and reconstructed the histories of bioclimate evolution and environmental change since similar to 18.7 cal ka BP. The reconstruction results show that 18.7-14.8 cal ka BP was a loess accumulation period under a steppe environment, and no water environment (lake or wetland) was formed in the Mianchi Basin at that time. 11.4-6.7 cal ka BP was the period of lacustrine deposition, and the upward increasing trend in the content of Concentricystes suggests that the water extent was gradually increasing during this period. 6.7-1.2 cal ka BP was a wetland-dominating period that was also featured by significantly lowered content in Concentricystes and significantly elevated contents in Cyperaceae, Typha and Selaginella. This period can be palynologically divided into three intervals: the first interval (6.7-5.0 cal ka BP), herbaceous pollen increased significantly; the second interval (5.0-2.8 cal ka BP), tree pollen increased significantly; the third interval (2.8-1.2 cal ka BP): herbaceous pollen increased significantly. It should be particularly noted that although 2.8-1.2 cal ka BP belonged to the wetland-dominating period (6.7-1.2 cal ka BP), the wetland deposits were strongly altered by post-depositional pedogenic processes. The reconstructed moisture sequences, based on Tree Pollen (%) and Poaceae/(Artemisia+Chenopodiaceae) ratio, show that the climate in the Mianchi Basin was relatively wet in the Early Holocene (10-8 cal ka BP), the driest in the first half of the Middle Holocene (8-5 cal ka BP), the wettest in the second half of the Middle Holocene (5-2.8 cal ka BP), and relatively dry in the Late Holocene (2.8-1.2 cal ka BP). To examine the inferred moisture sequence of MC-1 section from a large-scale perspective, we compared the Holocene moisture sequence (MC-1) from the Central Plain of China with those from the north (northern China) and also with those from the south (the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River). The comparison shows that the driest period of Holocene in the Central Plain occurred in 8.0-5.0 cal ka BP, and the wettest period of Holocene in northern China occurred in 7.8-5.0 cal ka BP. Both are well corresponding to the low-value phase of ENSO intensity (8.0-5.0 cal ka BP). The Holocene dry period (7.0-3.0 cal ka BP) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is roughly corresponding to the low-value period of ENSO intensity. We propose here that the major mechanisms controlling the aforementioned spatiotemporal patterns of the Holocene moisture variations are ENSO and the ENSO-modulated north-south shift of WPSH (West Pacific subtropical high). The Holocene moisture condition in the Central Plain of China was in phase with that in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in some times (7.0-3.0 cal ka BP), and the moisture condition was in phase with that in the northern China in other times (5.0-2.8 cal ka BP).					陈, 亮/O-2761-2014; Shi, Tianyu/JAZ-0928-2023														0023-074X	2095-9419					2023	68	10					1230	1246		10.1360/TB-2022-0703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2022-0703													WOS:000975768700010

Comets, asteroids, meteorites, and the origin of the biosphere	INSTRUMENTS, METHODS, AND MISSIONS FOR ASTROBIOLOGY IX	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology IX	AUG 14-15, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE				During the past few decades, the delivery of water, organics, and prebiotic chemicals to the Biosphere of Earth during the Hadean (4.5-3.8 Ga) period of heavy bombardment by comets and asteroids has become more widely accepted. Comets are still largely regarded as frigid, pristine bodies of protosolar nebula material that are devoid of liquid water and therefore unsuitable for life. Complex organic compounds have been observed in comets and on the water-rich asteroid 1998 KY26 and near IR observations have indicated the presence of crystalline water ice and ammonia hydrate on the large Kuiper Belt object (50000) Quaoar that has resurfacing suggesting cryovolcanic outgassing. Spacecraft observations of the chemical compositions and characteristics of the nuclei of several comets (Halley, Boffelly, Wild 2, and Tempel 1) have shown that comets contain complex organic chemicals; that water is the predominant volatile; and that extremely high temperatures (similar to 350-400 K) can be reached on the surface of the very black (albedo similar to 0.03) nuclei of comets when they approach the Sun. Impact craters and pinnacles observed on comet Wild 2 suggest a thick crust. Episodic outbursts and jets from the nuclei of several comets indicate that localized regimes of liquid water and water vapor can periodically exist beneath the comet crust. The Deep Impact mission found the temperature of the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 at 1.5 AU varied from a minimum of 280 +/- 8 K the 330K (57 degrees C) on the sunlit side. In this paper it is argued that that pools and films of liquid water exist (within a wide range of temperatures) in cavities and voids just beneath the hot, black crust. The possibility of liquid water existing over a wide range of temperatures significantly enhances the possibility that comets might contain niches suitable for the growth of microbial communities and ecosystems. These regimes would be ideal for the growth of psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic photoautotrophs and chemolithotrophs such as the motile filamentous cyanobacteria (e.g., Calothrix, Oscillatoria, Phormidium, and Spirulina) that grow in geothermal springs and geysers of Earth at temperatures ranging from 320K to 345K and are also found growing in cold polar desert soils. The mineralized remains of morphotypes of all of these cyanobacteria have also been found in the Orgueil C11 and the Murchison CN2 carbonaceous meteorites that may derive from cometary parent bodies. Observational results that support the hypothesis that liquid water can in active regions just beneath the surface of comets and that comets, carbonaceous meteorites, and asteroids may have played a significant role in the origin and evolution of the Biosphere and in the distribution of microbial life throughout the Solar System.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	0-8194-6388-4				2006	6309								63090J	10.1117/12.690437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.690437													WOS:000241767700017
J	Das, BK; Dhiman, SC				Das, BK; Dhiman, SC			Water and sediment chemistry of Higher Himalayan lakes in the Spiti Valley: control on weathering, provenance and tectonic setting of the basin	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The geochemical study of the Dankar, Thinam and Gete lakes of the Spiti Valley has revealed that these lakes are characterized by varying contents of major ions, i.e. Ca, Mg, HCO3, Na, K, Cl, SO4, SiO2 and Sr as trace element. The concentration of these elements is significant, as they indicate the nature of the lithology and the type of weathering at the source. The sediment chemistry data have also been employed to quantify weathering intensity and to elucidate the provenance and basin tectonic setting where terrigenous sediment is deposited. Dankar Lake is located on the limestone-dolomite-rich Lilang Group of rocks (Triassic), and dissolution of carbonate is the prime source of ionic concentration in this lake. The high (Ca+Mg):HCO3 equivalent ratio of 6.94 indicates carbonate weathering, and the very low (Na+K):T-Z(+) ratio of 0.07, which is used as an indicator of silicate weathering, shows insignificant silica dissolution in this lake. On the other hand, in Lake Thinam a relatively low (Ca+Mg):HCO3 equivalent ratio of 2.09, a (Na+K):T-Z(+) ratio of 0.12 and other parameters indicate that carbonate is derived from calcareous nodules and thin intercalations of limestone in the Spiti shales (Jurassic), and also some contribution from silicate lithology is evident. Mixing of groundwater cannot be ruled out, as springs are observed in this lake. In Lake Gete, the (Ca+Mg):HCO3 equivalent ratio is again high at 5.04, and the (Na+K):T-Z(+) ratio is 0.15, indicating dissolution of both carbonate and silicate rocks in the basin. This is consistent with the corresponding lithology in the lakes, and their denudation. Very high Sr contents of 2,331 mug/l in Dankar Lake, 715 mug/l in Gete Lake and 160 mug/l in Thinam Lake are significant and support dissolution of carbonate rocks, as the silicate rocks contribute less Sr although its isotopic ratio is high. It is also reflected that mechanical erosion and chemical weathering are perhaps the effective processes in this region. The former exposes fresh mineral surface for dissolution. The chemical index of alteration (CIA), with an average value of 78.79 in Dankar and 81.06 in Gete, indicates high weathering conditions. The K2O-Fe2O3-Al2O3 triangular plots of the samples demonstrate residual clay formation, indicating intense weathering at the source. The clay mineralogical data corroborate the above observation. The sediment chemistry data document depletion in SiO2 and Al2O3, as they are enriched in carbonates and depleted in Na2O, K2O, MnO, and TiO2, as compared to PAAS and UCC which are related to strong weathering at the source. The positive linear correlation between K and Rb suggests that they are contained in the illitic phase, and high positive correlation of Zr and Y with SiO2 indicates their association with coarser-grain, quartz-rich sandstone. The high phyllosilicates and low feldspar and major element chemistry indicate recycling and mineral maturity of sediments deposited in the Tethyan basin in a passive margin setting. This also indicates older sedimentary-metasedimentary rocks which are ideally exposed in the Spiti Valley. The tectonic discriminant plots portray a passive margin tectonic setting of the detritus in these lakes.																			0943-0105					SEP	2003	44	6					717	730		10.1007/s00254-003-0821-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-003-0821-2													WOS:000185092200010

The first part of the study involves a spatial assessment of mudflow hazard and susceptibility using GIS technologies and MCDA. The key condition for evaluating mudflow hazard is the identification of factors influencing the formation of mudflows. The susceptibility assessment was based on viewing the area as an object of spatial and functional analysis, enabling determination of its susceptibility to mudflow impacts across geomorphological zones: initiation, transformation, and accumulation. Relevant criteria were selected for analysis, each assigned weights based on expert judgment and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results include maps of potential mudflow hazard and susceptibility, showing areas of hazard occurrence and risk impact zones within the Talgar River basin. According to the mudflow hazard map, more than 50% of the basin area is classified as having a moderate hazard level, while 28.4% is subject to high hazard, and only 1.8% falls under the very high hazard category. The remaining areas are categorized as very low (4.1%) and low (14.7%) hazard zones. In terms of susceptibility to mudflows, 40.1% of the territory is exposed to a high level of susceptibility, 35.6% to a moderate level, and 5.5% to a very high level. The remaining areas are classified as very low (1.8%) and low (15.6%) susceptibility zones. The predictive performance was evaluated through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of the mudflow hazard assessment is 0.86, which indicates good adaptability and relatively high accuracy, while the AUC value for assessing the susceptibility of the territory is 0.71, which means that the accuracy of assessing the susceptibility of territories to mudflows is within the acceptable level of model accuracy. To refine the spatial risk assessment, mudflow modeling was conducted under three scenarios of glacial-moraine lake outburst using the RAMMS model. For each scenario, key flow parameters-height and velocity-were identified, forming the basis for classification of zones by impact intensity. The integration of MCDA and RAMMS results produced a final mudflow risk map reflecting both the likelihood of occurrence and the extent of potential damage. The presented approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining GIS analysis, MCDA, and physically-based modeling for comprehensive natural hazard assessment and can be applied to other mountainous regions with high mudflow activity.																				2073-4441				AUG 4	2025	17	15							2316	10.3390/w17152316	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17152316													WOS:001548713000001

In line with this objective, we collected 22 samples (gas and water phase) from 16 geothermal fields in NE Turkey covering an area of nearly 100,000 km(2) that extends from the eastern termination of North Anatolian Fault towards the Georgian and Armenian borders. The He-3/He-4 ratios of the samples (R) normalized to the atmospheric He-3/He-4 ratio (Ra = 1.4 x 10(-6)) vary from 0.31 to 7.15, and are considerably higher than the crustal value of 0.02Ra. Regarding spatial distribution of helium isotope composition, samples collected from areas of tectonic unrest around the Erzincan and Erzurum pull-apart basins in the southern part are represented by a higher range of He-3/He-4 ratios (>5 Ra) than those in volcanic areas to the east and northeast of the region. delta C-13(CO2) values of the gas samples varying from -20.76 to 5.43 parts per thousand are about 4-5 parts per thousand lower than delta C-13(DIC) values of the water samples that range from -16.90 to 8.85 parts per thousand, indicating CO2 removal from waters by degassing. CO2/He-3 ratios of gas samples falling in the range of 3.81 x 10(9) to 2.83 x 10(12) imply that carbon is derived from the mixing between the crustal lithologies and mantle, the latter having a contribution up to 40 %. The maximum flux of mantle-derived fluids is found 88 mm/a at Erzincan (eastern part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone). This value is higher by a factor of about 10 than the western part of the fault zone. Calculations show that degassing from magmatic bodies is the sole mechanism to explain the high helium isotope compositions in the region. Therefore, we suggest that mantle-derived He contents might be due to extensive melting associated with active tectonism. The He-3/Heat ratios of thermal waters in northeastern Turkey were calculated in range of 0.25 to 29.7 x 10(-15) cm(3)(STP)/J, consistent with the data reported for waters along the North Anatolian Fault, indicating a crustal heat source for the geothermal systems in northeastern Turkey.

The high mineral content in many sources of cooling water results in hardened, calcified scale deposits forming on the walls of condenser tubes. These deposits form an insulation barrier inhibiting heat transfer. The scale also reduces the inner diameter of the tubes, restricting the flow of cooling water and further reducing heat transfer. As the heat transfer rate falls, performance of the condenser degrades, which can lead to decreasing megawatt output Of the plant. A power station in the United States sources hard lakewater for cooling. Like many plants utilizing hard water, the station relies on a water treatment program to control the formation of hard scale deposits. However, when the plant opened a closed cooling water exchanger (CCW) in its Unit 1, a layer of calcium carbonate was found on the tube walls throughout the bundle. The CCW exchanger was shot with a variety of mechanical cleaners to thoroughly remove the scale and other deposits and debris from the tubes. Plant management suspected that the same problem might be occurring in the main condenser, and they understood that if scale was forming inside the condenser, the resulting loss in heat transfer rate would be a contributing factor in the decreased efficiency of the unit. Since the plant was planning an eddy current test on 100% of the more than 12,000 stainless steel tubes in the main condenser, the tubes were required to be thoroughly cleaned. Upon opening the main condenser, technicians verified the presence of calcium carbonate fouling, confirming their suspicions. While not knowing the condition of the tubes underneath the deposit, plant engineers were concerned about the underlying tube condition. They were also looking for alternative cleaning methods to provide relief from environmental concerns often associated with chemical cleaning. To preserve tube integrity and assure thorough removal of deposits, the plant decided to clean the condenser tubes utilizing the same mechanical cleaning method as the CCW unit. The condenser tubes would be shot with a series of specialized mechanical tube cleaners, one designed to fracture the calcium carbonate and a second designed to remove the fractured scale and other deposits from the tubes. This paper highlights the role of hard water in condenser tube fouling, the need to remove scale from condenser tubes and the mechanical cleaning process that was used to restore condenser performance at a prototypical coal fired power station in the United States.																					978-0-7918-5760-1				2017																								WOS:000414877000084

Juvenile hybrid Striped Bass poststocking dispersal, escapement, and survival	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Reservoirs represent valuable fisheries but grow increasingly more difficult to manage as they age. Stocking is typically a necessary component of management to both introduce and sustain reservoir sport fish populations. Hybrid Striped Bass (Striped Bass Morone saxatilis x White Bass M. chrysops) are a popular stocking option in reservoirs to enhance recreational fisheries, although little is known regarding the fate of these fish after stocking. We sought to assess poststocking dispersal, survival, and escapement of juvenile hybrid Striped Bass in two reservoirs in Iowa, United States.Methods We acoustically tagged 50 juvenile hybrid Striped Bass (194-251 mm total length) and stocked 25 into Rathbun Lake and 25 into Big Creek Lake, Iowa, in late November 2022. We estimated departure times and dispersal distances from stocking locations, arrival times and residency at outlet structures, and weekly apparent survival.Results All fish departed stocking locations within the first 2 d poststocking; dispersal increased from 1,600 m after 1 d to 4,400 m after 99 d poststocking in Big Creek Lake and from 2,800 m after 1 d to 8,800 m after 99 d poststocking in Rathbun Lake. Over half of stocked fish arrived at the outlet structure, with a majority of those arriving in less than 1 month in both reservoirs. Residency at the outlet structure increased as water level decreased in Big Creek Lake but was not related to discharge at Rathbun Lake. Only one fish escaped Big Creek Lake, whereas no escapement occurred from Rathbun Lake. Weekly apparent survival increased with fish length, but only one fish survived to the end of the study in each reservoir (4% survival), and cumulative survival probability after 42 weeks was 0.004.Conclusions Hybrid Striped Bass quickly dispersed and moved extensively after stocking, often reaching reservoir outlet structures, which put them at risk of escapement. However, escapement was low, likely due to low water levels, whereas mortality was high. Survival was higher for large fish, suggesting that smaller fish may have faced size-specific challenges related to overwinter survival, such as a lack of energy reserves and a lack of prey items. More information regarding the direct cause of this observed size-dependent mortality would help to guide management plans and improve hybrid Striped Bass stocking programs. Hybrid Striped Bass quickly and extensively dispersed from stocking locations, putting them at risk of escapement. Weekly survival increased with fish body size, but cumulative survival was low, identifying challenges with introducing and maintaining populations.

J	Davis, RL				Davis, RL			The value of teaching about geomorphology in non-traditional settings	GEOMORPHOLOGY					30th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	NOV 12-14, 1999	BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK					Academics usually teach about geomorphology in the classroom, where the audience is enthusiastic, but generally small. Less traditional settings offer opportunities to reach a wider audience, one that is equally enthusiastic. given its love of geomorphic features in the National Parks, but one which has little knowledge of the science behind what they are seeing. I have "taught" geomorphology in four non-traditional settings: at a summer camp, a state wildlife refuge, on community field trips, and at meetings for clubs and government boards. This paper discusses my experiences and offers suggestions to others who may wish to follow this less-traveled educational path. As Head of Nature, Programs at Camp Pernigewassett in New Hampshire, I have worked. over the last 33 years, with thousands of campers ranging from 8 to 15 years old. Our setting, in a glaciated valley on a small lake, exhibits a wide range of geomorphic features and offers many opportunities for direct learning through field investigations. I have found that even 8-year olds can do real science, if we avoid the jargon, Once "taught" they carry their knowledge about landforms and processes with them and eagerly share it with their friends and family on outings and trips, thus reaching an even wider public. Pats, wildlife refuges, nature preserves, and other similar areas generally have nature trails, often with educational information about the environment, Generally, interpretive signs are prepared by biologists and the content ignores the site's physical features, as well as the connections between ecological communities and the underlying geology and geomorphology. My students and I have addressed this situation at two places in Connecticut, one a state wildlife management area, also used for training teachers to teach Environmental Education, and the other, a town recreation area, We catalogued the geomorphic features, looked at relationships of the community level ecology to those features, and prepared interpretive signs that added this perspective to the trails. The public response has been extremely favorable. Geomorphology can also be taught by leading field trips for community organizations. I have done this twice, once for the Manchester (NH) Historical Society and once for a small watershed association. The attendance and interest surprised me. We finally had to limit the Manchester trip to one full busload (similar to 45) and the watershed trip, which was part of a "trails day," drew over 90 people. Finally, I have found that organizations such as Sierra Club chapters and town conservation boards are frequently looking for speakers for their periodic meetings. "Arhy not a geomorphologist? After all, much of what conservationists do is related to what geomorphologists do. I have given several of these presentations and the receptions have always been enthusiastic. While the work involved in preparing to teach in one of these non-traditional settings is frequently substantial, the rewards are equally large. It is a way to reach masses of people who know little about the science of geomorphology and to demonstrate its importance to them. Taking our message directly to the public in these settings is an effective way to put geomorphology in the public eye. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	HIGGS, R				HIGGS, R			THE BUDE FORMATION (LOWER WESTPHALIAN), SW ENGLAND - SILICICLASTIC SHELF SEDIMENTATION IN A LARGE EQUATORIAL LAKE	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The 1300-m-thick turbiditic Bude Formation was deposited in a lake, Lake Bude, but disagreement persists over whether the environment was a deltaic or deep-water fan. The tectonic setting of the lake was the northern flank of a northerly advancing Variscan foreland basin, close to the Westphalian palaeo-equator. Palaeocurrents indicate sediment sourcing from all quadrants except the south. There is a dm-m scale cyclicity, whereby sandstone bodies comprising amalgamated event beds alternate with mudstone intervals containing non-amalgamated event beds. The 'ideal' cycle is a symmetrical coarsening-up/fining-up cycle, consisting of three facies (1, 2 and 3) arranged in 12321 order. Facies 3, in the middle of the cycle, is an amalgamated sandstone body up to 10 m thick which interfingers laterally with thin (cm) mudstone layers. The sandstone body comprises amalgamated beds of very fine sandstone which are largely massive and up to 0.4 m thick. Channels are absent except for scours up to 0.2 m deep which truncate the interfingering mudstone layers. Sandstone bodies are inferred to be tongue-shaped in three dimensions. Facies 1 and 2, completing the 12321 cycle, are respectively dark-grey fine and light-grey coarse, varved(?) mudstone containing thin (< 0.4 m) sandstone event beds. Fossils and burrows indicate that facies 1 and 2 were deposited, respectively, in brackish (rarely marine) and fresh water. Hence, the ideal cycle (12321) reflects an upward decrease then increase in salinity (brackish-fresh-brackish); this is attributed to the lake sill being periodically overtopped by the sea, due to glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillations. The resulting oscillations in lake depth produced the coarsening-up/fining-up (regressive-transgressive) cyclicity, the central sandstone body representing the regressive maximum. Event beds are interpreted as river-fed turbidites deposited during catastrophic storm-floods. Combined-flow ripples and other wave-influenced structres occur in event beds throughout the ideal cycle, suggesting deposition of the entire Bude Formation above storm wave base. The proposed environment is a shelf, of continental-shelf dimensions, but lacustrine instead of marine. Sandstone bodies are interpreted to be river-connected tongues or lobes. The absence of cycles containing nearshore or emergent facies is attributed to: (i) the lake sill preventing the water level from falling below sill level, thereby insulating the lake floor from eustatically forced emergence; and (ii) relatively distal deposition, beyond the reach of shoreline progradations. The lack of palaeoflow from the south is attributed to a (now eroded?) deep-water trough lying to the south, in front of the northerly advancing orogen. Some facies 2 laminated mudstone beds grade laterally into massive and/or contorted beds, interpreted as in-situ seismites (Facies 4), consistent with an active foreland basin setting. Development of seismites was possibly facilitated by gas bubbles and/or weak cohesion in the (fresh water) bottom mud. The late Quaternary Black Sea, with its broad northwestern shelf, is probably a good physiographical analogue of Lake Bude, and was likewise fresh at times.

J	Chernov, RA; Muraviev, AY				Chernov, R. A.; Muraviev, A. Ya			Experience in using high-frequency georadar for landscape snow survey in the vicinity of Kirovsk (the Khibiny Mountains) and Apatit. (the Kola Peninsula)	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The results of processing of a profile snow-measuring survey of snow cover in the Khibiny Mountains are presented. The survey was performed during the period of maximum snow accumulation (March of 2020) on the main elements of the landscape: mixed forest on the plain, open woodlands at the bottom of valleys, plateaus, wooded slopes, and upper slopes without woody vegetation. The averaged values of snow storage for different types of the landscapes were obtained for the period of the maximum snow accumulation in the snowy winter of 2019/20. The maximum snow storage (> 700 mm w.e.) was determined for areas on the high plateaus and open woodlands at the bottom of valleys. Minimum snow storage (> 400 mm w.e.) was recorded in areas of mixed forest on the plain and on an ice cover of lakes. Measurements of snow depth were carried out by the standard method (a handspike) and the ground-based radio-echo sounding using georadar with the frequency of 1600 MHz. The accuracy of this method allows measuring of the snow depth with accuracy of 1 cm for a dense snow and 2 cm for a loose one. Thus, the accuracy of measuring the snow depth with the radar is comparable to the accuracy of a handspike. A large number of radar measurements of snow depth on the profiles makes possible to determine the spatial variability of this value and its statistical characteristics. As a result, a vertical gradient of snow accumulation was defined as 25 mm w.e. per 100 m. The smallest spatial variability of snow depth was observed on profiles in the forests on the plain, in woodlands, and on the upper slopes. On profiles with complex relief (plateau, lower slopes), the spatial variability of snow depth is significant - the standard deviation was within limits of 30%. Based on the results of processing the field data, a map of snow storage over the studying area during the period of maximum snow accumulation was constructed. When constructing the map, we took into account the averaged data of the measurements for each type of landscape, the boundaries of woody vegetation, the height, steepness of slopes, and the high-altitude gradient of snow accumulation. It was found that features of the spatial distribution of snow cover were primarily due to the location of natural landscape complexes. The role of changes in snow storages with altitude was found to be insignificant.

SYNCRETISM OF ANTIQUITY AND MODERNITY AMONG THE PEOPLES OF THE MIDDLE OB (FROM OBSERVATIONS OF THE 1960S-1970S)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY												The article presents some observations of scientists about the life and traditions of the indigenous small-numbered peoples of Siberia - Khanty and Selkups. First of all, the most interesting are those moments of innovations in the life of Khanty and Selkups, which allow us to trace and explain the influence of their worldview on behavior, rituals, and traditions. V.M. Kulemzin reports on the possibility of penetration into the spiritual world of the Khanty by observing the behavior of the Khanty fisherman, for whom the invisible world of spirits is quite real. He believes that the creek between the lakes was dug by the pike-mammoth, that the spirits help him in fishing, strengthening the stakes in the constipation with a sacred hammer, that the steam from the soup is enough for feeding the spirits, that the sacred fire, born by friction, helps to deliver gifts to the dead ancestors and gods on sky. V.M. Kulemzin suggests that the cults of elk and of bear are closely related, while the cult of elk is more ancient, and this fact requires special study. V.P. Zinoviev shares with readers his youth observations of his compatriots, the Selkup of Chvorhol-et yurts (Tyukhterevs). He was struck by the carelessness of the Tyukhterev inhabitants, who had no reserves and lived from catching to catching elk, ducks, fish. The Selkups were extremely careless about harvesting vegetables for the winter. Their lack of respect for industrial work the author explains not by laziness, but by the psychology of the person of appropriating society, who always had the opportunity to turn to the storeroom of mother nature, and therefore did not make special food reserves. Even in present time, when nature has become impoverished, and the transition to productive labor has become a necessity, the Selkups can not abandon traditions and previous ideas about the world. V.P. Zinoviev was also struck by the full gender equality in the distribution of products: even the youngest member of the family had the right to his share of food, even if it was harmful for his health vodka. According to the authors, this is one of the reasons for the general alcoholization of the Selkups. The authors came to the conclusion that the degree of combining innovations and traditions can be very different, depending on the field of activity and specific circumstances, on the intensity of acculturation and assimilation processes. At the same time, they note that the danger to traditional cultures lies not only in reducing the natural and economic basis of their existence, but also in their persistent rejection of new ways of life support.
