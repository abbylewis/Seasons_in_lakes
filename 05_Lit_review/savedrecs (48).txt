Metal(loid) Partitioning and Transport in the Jinsha River, China: From Upper Natural Reaches to Lower Cascade Reservoirs-Regulated Reaches	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Riverine contamination of metals and metalloids is a growing global concern. However, our understanding of how cascade reservoirs influence the fate of these pollutants remains limited. In this study, we focused on the Jinsha River, a typical large river polluted with metal(loid)s in Southwest China, to investigate the partitioning and transport of these substances from the upper natural reaches to the lower cascade reservoirs-regulated reaches during both flood and dry seasons. Results revealed that the rapid urbanization and industrial development following the construction of reservoirs led to significant copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd) pollution. Through various analytical techniques such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis, redundancy analysis, and structural equation modeling, we determined that reservoirs had a profound impact on solid-associated parameters, including particulate organic matter (POM), suspended solid concentration (SSC), and median particle diameter (D50). 50 ). These parameters, in turn, affected the fate of metal(loid)s through processes like sorption-desorption and dissolution-precipitation. High POM concentrations and low SSC and D 50 values resulted in the precipitation of most particulate metal(loid)s, thereby reducing their transport across reservoirs. As river water moved downstream across the reservoirs, the percentage of particulate metal(loid)s decreased by 6.1% for arsenic (As), 38.3% for Cu, 74.9% for Ni, 36.8% for Cr, 17.8% for Cd, and 41.9% for Pb, respectively. Furthermore, the cascade reservoirs had cumulative effects on the deposition of particulate metal(loid)s, particularly concerning Cr, Cd, and Pb in the final reservoirs. Human health risk assessments indicated that dissolved As and Pb posed potential non-carcinogenic threats to residents. Despite the fact that reservoirs captured most particulate metal(loid)s, the transport of dissolved As and Pb across the reservoirs still impacted the safety of downstream drinking water. Therefore, in cascade reservoir systems, the concern regarding dissolved metal(loid) pollution remains a priority for future reservoir management.					wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025; Yuan, Qiusheng/ACH-6937-2022														1726-2135	1684-8799				DEC	2024	44	2					126	139		10.3808/jei.202400524	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.202400524													WOS:001337608200004

Annual Under-vine Cover Crops Did Not Impact Vine Growth or Fruit Composition of Mature Cool-climate 'Riesling' Grapevines	HORTTECHNOLOGY												In the cool and humid climate of the northeastern United States, vegetation is typically maintained between the rows of wine grape (Vitis vinifera) vineyards, but the area directly beneath vines is conventionally kept bare using herbicides or cultivation, to reduce competition for water and nutrients. Yet with rising concerns of herbicide resistance, environmental contamination, and soil erosion, alternatives to maintaining bare ground in vineyards should be considered. In warmer and more arid climates, using cover crops as an alternative to bare soil has sometimes resulted in reduced vine growth and yields. In more cool and humid climates, like in the northeastern United States, where conditions can promote excessive vine growth, replacing bare soil with under-vine cover crops was hypothesized to improve vine growth characteristics and fruit quality from reducing excessive vigor. This study compared three annual under-vine cover crops of resident vegetation (RES), buckwheat (BW) (Fagopyrum esculentum), and annual ryegrass (ARC) (Lolium multiflorum), planted in the 1-m-wide strip directly under vines at the start of each growing season, against the conventional weed-free under-vine row maintained with glyphosate. The experiment was established in 2011 and repeated in 2012 and 2013 in a 20-year-old block of 'Riesling' wine grapes (clone 198 on S04 rootstock) in a commercial vineyard in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Harvested grapes were fermented in duplicate using standard white wine procedures. Among the four under-vine treatments, no significant differences were found in measures of vegetative growth, yield, petiole nutrient concentrations at veraison, or predawn and midday stem water potentials. Under-vine treatments were not found to significantly affect soil organic matter, aggregate stability, and nutrient concentrations. Juice characteristics were also not significantly different among treatments. In this study, the mature vines in this rain-fed 'Riesling' vineyard likely had a well developed and extensive rooting system that was able to overcome any competition effects for water or nutrients from the comparatively shallow root systems of the annually established cover crops. Without any induced competition in the conditions of this study, under-vine cover crops had no effects on vine growth, yield, or juice characteristics when compared with conventional herbicide use in the under-vine row. When multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis was used to determine differences in aroma among wine treatment replicates, treatments were found to significantly impact the perceived aromatic properties of the wines, even though no measures of growth or juice characteristics were affected. Using under-vine vegetation may be a viable alternative to conventional herbicide use for vineyard floor management in mature wine grape vineyards in cool and humid climates.

Watershed scale application of WEPP and EROSION 3D models for assessment of potential sediment source areas and runoff flux in the Mara River Basin, Kenya	CATENA												Mara River basin is an internationally acclaimed and ecologically significant basin in the Lake Victoria basin. The recent trend in major land use change in the upstream (forest-to-agriculture conversion) has been the major driver for the current hydrologic alterations. Recent hydrologic data and observations show a reduction in dry season flow, increase in peak flows during wet seasons and an increase in sediment load. This has led to the need for more observation and modeling to understand the impacts of the various land use changes on the sediment and runoff characteristics of the watershed. Two physically based models (Erosion 3D and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)) were applied to predict the watershed scale sediment and runoff response. Watershed scale modeling results show that sediment yield and runoff vary by slope, land use and soil type. The spatial sediment budget also shows the variability in the erosion and deposition of sediment in the basin. Average simulated erosion in cultivated land was about 120 t/ha/yr and the lowest simulated erosion rate was on bush lands and grasslands, which may indicate change in land use has significant impact on soil erosion in the Mara River basin. It was shown that both WEPP and EROSION 3D models are useful tools for watershed scale application and estimation of runoff and sediment yield. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Davis, J; Sim, L; Chambers, J				Davis, Jenny; Sim, Lien; Chambers, Jane			Multiple stressors and regime shifts in shallow aquatic ecosystems in antipodean landscapes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Changes in land management (land use and land cover) and water management (including extraction of ground water and diversion of surface waters for irrigation) driven by increases in agricultural production and urban expansion (and fundamentally by population growth) have created multiple stressors on global freshwater ecosystems that we can no longer ignore. 2. The development and testing of conceptual ecological models that examine the impact of stressors on aquatic ecosystems, and recognise that responses may be nonlinear, is now essential for identifying critical processes and predicting changes, particularly the possibility of catastrophic regime shifts or 'ecological surprises'. 3. Models depicting gradual ecological change and three types of regime shift (simple thresholds, hysteresis and irreversible changes) were examined in the context of shallow inland aquatic ecosystems (wetlands, shallow lakes and temporary river pools) in southwestern Australia subject to multiple anthropogenic impacts (hydrological change, eutrophication, salinisation and acidification). 4. Changes in hydrological processes, particularly the balance between groundwater-dominated versus surface water-dominated inputs and a change from seasonal to permanent water regimes appeared to be the major drivers influencing ecological regime change and the impacts of eutrophication and acidification (in urban systems) and salinisation and acidification (in agricultural systems). 5. In the absence of hydrological change, urban wetlands undergoing eutrophication and agricultural wetlands experiencing salinisation appeared to fit threshold models. Models encompassing alternative regimes and hysteresis appeared to be applicable where a change from a seasonal to permanent hydrological regime had occurred. 6. Irreversible ecological change has potentially occurred in agricultural landscapes because the external economic driver, agricultural productivity, persists independently of the impact on aquatic ecosystems. 7. Thematic implications: multiple stressors can create multiple thresholds that may act in a hierarchical fashion in shallow, lentic systems. The resulting regime shifts may follow different models and trajectories of recovery. Challenges for ecosystem managers and researchers include determining how close a system may be to critical thresholds and which processes are essential to maintaining or restoring the system. This requires an understanding of both external drivers and internal ecosystem dynamics, and the interactions between them, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.

Submersed macrophytes play a key role in structuring bacterioplankton community composition in the large, shallow, subtropical Taihu Lake, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Within-lake horizontal heterogeneity of bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was investigated in the large and shallow subtropical Taihu Lake (2338 km(2), maximum depth < 3 m). Samples were collected at 17 sites along a trophic gradient ranging from mesotrophic to hypertrophic areas in August and September 2004. These sites cover two alternative stable states of shallow lakes, which are basically characterized by the dominance or the lack of submerged macrophytes. In the case of Taihu Lake, the macrophyte-dominated state is characterized by clear water and immobilized sediment, and the state largely lacking macrophytes is characterized by the dominance of phytoplankton, frequent wind-driven re-suspension of sediments, and a high turbidity. Three different methods, i.e. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), reverse line blot hybridization (RLB) with probes targeting 17 freshwater bacterial groups, and 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, were used for analysis of BCC. The BCC varied strongly between the two alternative ecological states, but less pronounced between phytoplankton-dominated sites even spanning chlorophyll a gradients from 16.5 (mesotrophic) to 229.8 mu g l(-1) (hypertrophic). The 16S rRNA gene library representing the turbid water state contained many sequences closely related to sequences previously obtained from soil or freshwater sediment samples. Furthermore, sequences representing two new lineages of freshwater Actinobacteria were obtained from the investigated samples. Comparative statistical analyses of BCC along the investigated ecological gradients revealed that the dominance of submersed macrophytes was the most influential factor on BCC, responsible for a major part of the observed within-habitat heterogeneity of BCC in Taihu Lake.

Pollen-climate reconstruction from northern South Island, New Zealand ( 41°S), reveals varying high- and low-latitude teleconnections over the last 16 000 years	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We present a 16 000-year vegetation and climate reconstruction from pollen and plant macrofossil records obtained at a small alpine lake in South Island, New Zealand (41 degrees S). The expansion of lowland forest taxa suggests a lifting of the altitudinal forest limits because of a warming pulse between 13 and 10k cal a BP and between 7 and 6k cal a BP, while their decline relative to upland forest taxa indicates cooling phases between 10 and 7k cal a BP and over the last 3000 years. The modern treeline was first established locally by 9.7k cal a BP. Forest persisted at the site until 3k cal a BP then disappeared from the record. Close correspondence between the temperature trends inferred from the pollen and macrofossil records and proxies from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean suggests a strong teleconnection between New Zealand and the Southern Hemisphere high-latitudes between 15 and 6k cal a BP. We note that the breakdown of this coupling, a cooling trend in Adelaide Tarn and the local disappearance of beech forest after 3k cal a BP occur during a period of increased frequency of El Ni (n) over tildeo events, suggesting an enhanced teleconnection with the low-latitudes during the late Holocene.

Spatial and Temporal Correlates of Greenhouse Gas Diffusion from a Hydropower Reservoir in the Southern United States	WATER												Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from freshwater reservoirs constitute a globally significant source of atmospheric greenhouse gases ( GHGs), but knowledge gaps remain with regard to spatiotemporal drivers of emissions. We document the spatial and seasonal variation in surface diffusion of CO2 and CH4 from Douglas Lake, a hydropower reservoir in Tennessee, USA. Monthly estimates across 13 reservoir sites from January to November 2010 indicated that surface diffusions ranged from 236 to 18,806 mg . m- 2 . day- 1 for CO2 and 0 to 0.95 mg . m- 2 . day- 1 for CH4. Next, we developed statistical models using spatial and physicochemical variables to predict surface diffusions of CO2 and CH4. Models explained 22.7% and 20.9% of the variation in CO2 and CH4 diffusions respectively, and identified pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and Julian day as the most informative predictors. These findings provide baseline estimates of GHG emissions from a reservoir in eastern temperate North America, a region for which estimates of reservoir GHGs emissions are limited. Our statistical models effectively characterized non-linear and threshold relationships between physicochemical predictors and GHG emissions. Further refinement of such modeling approaches will aid in predicting current GHG emissions from unsampled reservoirs and forecasting future GHG emissions.					stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012; Phillips, Jana/G-4755-2016	stewart, arthur/0000-0003-1968-5997; Phillips, Jana/0000-0001-9319-2336; Mosher, Jennifer/0000-0001-6976-2036														2073-4441				NOV	2015	7	11					5910	5927		10.3390/w7115910	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7115910													WOS:000365923400003

Correction of dust event frequency from MODIS Quick-Look imagery using in-situ aerosol measurements over the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Subjective visual interpretation of MODIS Quick-Look imagery has proven useful in characterising dust source geomorphology and dust event frequency over diverse areas, but is limited by the small temporal sampling window of polar orbiting platforms, and obscuration by cloud. In this paper we seek to quantify the inevitable under-reporting of dust events in Quick-Look imagery, via a three-year case study over the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), the largest dust source in Australia and the southern hemisphere. Dust event identification from MODIS imagery is compared with the level of dust mobilization inferred from measurements of near-surface aerosol made by a continuously-operating integrating nephelometer, located at the AeroSpan/AERONET station at Tinga Tingana in the Strzelecki Desert, adjacent to major dust sources in the LEB. The analysis indicates a major upward revision in the overall dust event frequency by -72%, including a doubling of the incidence of major dust outbreaks. The intensity of missed events increases toward late afternoon and evening, although without a net day-night bias. These factors suggest the potential of new geostationary sensors and the analysis of night-time polar orbiting imagery in improving the reporting of dust mobilization over active dust-source regions. For the LEB, the corrections are crucial in understanding not only the seasonal distribution of dust mobilization, but its interannual variability and climatology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study describes the zooplankton diversity and community structure, as well as their relationships with ecological factors, in homestead ponds of a coastal district along the northern Bay of Bengal region. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were detected in the mean values of temperature, pH, DO, TDS, transparency, and phosphates from the ponds during December 2020, but no significant differences were found in the nitrate levels. However, no significant variances in the ecological parameters between months were found due to the study taking place in the same season. Sixteen zooplankton species, representing four groups, were found in the study area, with the highest mean abundance of 301.19 +/- 40.55 ind./L recorded in February 2021 and the lowest of 293.02 +/- 21.13 ind./L recorded in December 2020. The diversity (H'), evenness (e), richness (J), and dominance (D) ranged from 2.49 to 2.12, from 0.93 to 0.84, from 2.05 to 1.56, and from 0.13 to 0.09, respectively. Based on the SIMPER analysis, Diaptomus gracilis and Brachionus calyciflorus were found to be significant contributors (>10%) to the zooplankton community structure in different months. The ANOSIM results revealed that 10 species of zooplankton were significant contributors based on their average dissimilarity. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified that pH, transparency, nitrates, and phosphates have a significant impact on the abundance of zooplankton species in the homestead ponds in the study area.

Interspecific competition, predation, increased disturbance, organochlorine poisoning and food shortages were suggested as main reasons for the overall decrease. Here we contribute to a better understanding of population declines by comparing foraging movements of satellite tracked adult gulls in three geographical areas of Finland (West, South, and East) that differ in their population trends. Our analysis examines potential differences and preferences in the feeding site behaviour of adult gulls. Our comparison of the three geographical areas showed that nLBBGs preferred feeding at fur farms in West Finland, waste dumps in South Finland, and lakes and fields in East Finland. We found individual gulls of this purportedly generalist species to be highly specialised in their foraging behaviour, particularly those that might be associated with their survival probabilities. We hypothesise that differences in foraging behaviour and food availability during the breeding season are partially responsible for differences in demographic trends between populations. Specifically, we identify potential local conservation problems such as shooting in birds visiting fur farms. Our data suggest that the effective conservation and management of endangered nLBBGs could be aided by simple actions in the breeding areas in addition to better protection throughout the annual movement cycle.

In this study, variations in MC content were examined in water samples and fish tissues during a Microcystis aeruginosa-dominated bloom in a fish pond in China, from June 2009 to August 2009. A total of ten microcystin variants were detected in water samples in the fish pond, including MCLR, MCRR, MCYR, MCLF, MCLY, MCLA, and MCLW, and other three undefined MC variants. MCLR was the dominant variant in the water samples, followed by MCLF and MCLY. The highest MC concentration in the common carp (Aristichthys nobilis) was found in the order intestine > spleen > muscle; however, the order with the most MC variants detected was muscle > spleen = kidney = gallbladder > liver = intestine. The highest overall MC concentration detected in the water samples was 12.24 mu g L-1, and the estimated daily intake for humans from the consumption of fish was about 0.48 mu g MCLR eq kg(-1) body weight (BW), 12-fold the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the World Health Organization. Therefore, the combined risks from skin exposure and food intake in this fish pond should not be overlooked.

Non-additive interactive effects represent a mechanism where the degradation of biochemically persistent OM is stimulated by the provision of bioavailable OM to the degrading microbial community. Whilst this is well established in terrestrial systems, whether it occurs in aquatic ecosystems remains subject to debate. We hypothesised that OM from zooplankton carcasses can stimulate the degradation of biochemically persistent leaf material, and that this effect is influenced by the daphnia:leaf OM ratio and the complexity of the degrading microbial community. Fresh Daphnia magna carcasses and C-13-labelled maize leaves (Zea mays) were incubated at different ratios (1:1, 1:3 and 1:5) alongside either a complex microbial community (<50 mu m) or solely bacteria (<0.8 mu m). C-13 stable-isotope measurements of CO2 analyses were combined with phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis and DNA sequencing to link metabolic activities, biomass and taxonomic composition of the microbial community. Our experiments indicated a significantly higher respiration of leaf-derived C when daphnia-derived OM was most abundant (i.e. daphnia:leaf OM ratio of 1:1). This process was stronger in a complex microbial community, including eukaryotic microorganisms, than a solely bacterial community. We concluded that non-additive interactive effects were a function of increased C-N chemodiversity and microbial complexity, with the highest net respiration to be expected when chemodiversity is high and the degrading community complex. This study indicates that identifying the interactions and processes of OM degradation is one important key for a deeper understanding of aquatic and thus global carbon cycle.					; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Taube, Robert/JDV-7391-2023; Gladyshev, Michail/F-6975-2013	Woodhouse, Jason/0000-0003-1129-5396; Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; Neubauer, Darshan/0000-0002-0773-7772; Grossart, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-9141-0325; Kolmakova, Olesya/0000-0003-2694-7545; Taube, Robert/0000-0003-3136-8732; 													1751-7362	1751-7370				JUN	2021	15	6					1735	1750		10.1038/s41396-020-00883-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-00883-w		JAN 2021						33462364					WOS:000608632900001

Aphanizomenon, a common filamentous cyanobacterial genus belonging to Nostocales, is under particular concern because its several members are able to form harmful blooms. Furthermore, succession of bloom between A. flos-aquae and Microcystis occurs in many natural lakes. To evaluate the competitiveness of A. flos-aquae vs. M. aeruginosa, two sets of experiments at different ratios of biomass at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C were conducted. Results show that at 15 degrees C, the two species were able to coexist, and A. flos-aquae showed a specific higher growth rate, and its growth was promoted by the presence of M. aeruginosa. At 25 degrees C, the growth of A. flos-aquae was inhibited by the biomass of M. aeruginosa, and M. aeruginosa suppressed A. flos-aquae in competition. Additionally, the vegetative cell size of A. flos-aquae was significantly influenced by the co-culture with M. aeruginosa, whereas the filament length of A. flos-aquae was not significantly affected. This study confirms that temperature is the dominating factor on the succession of A. flos-aquae and M. aeruginosa of a different biomass.

However, the SO42- content of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs varies significantly by season, so environmental factors such as temperature can affect it. An experiment was conducted with a series of aerobic and anaerobic tanks containing Pearl River sediments and distilled water to assess the release of SO42- from sediments under controlled conditions. "Black-odor river" refers to near anoxic conditions in the water column and foul odors emanating from affected rivers in southeastern China. These river systems typical have sediments containing ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and organic sulfide compounds in excess, and precipitates of sulfide (S2-), with ferrous (Fe2+) or manganese (Mn2+). SO42- concentration was measured at various depths in pore water and in the water column while controlling temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Interpolation of study results revealed that SO42- content was highest between temperatures of 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The relationship between SO42- concentration, which varied with temperature and time, was fit using a linearized Michaelis-Menten function (R-2 = 0.69). The release of SO42- to the water column was accelerated during the experiment (for temperatures higher than 20 degrees C), and led to higher SO content in the water column than in pore water. The maximum concentration of SO42- within the sediment occurred at a temperature of 20 degrees C. Comparing aerated and nonaerated tanks at 20 degrees C, we found that O-2 restricted SO42- content in the water column; DO could, in turn, also be controlled by temperature. Fe2+ and Mn2+ had a negative correlation with SO42-. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimating the abundance of toxic Microcystis in the San Francisco Estuary using quantitative real-time PCR	HARMFUL ALGAE												Developing an effective and rapid method to identify and estimate the abundance of Microcystis is warranted in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in view of expanding cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Micro cystis spp. Blooms that occurred in the estuary from July to September 2007 were initially assessed using a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing primers designed for the conserved Microcystis-specific 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region. The presence of microcystin-producing (MC+) toxic Micro cystis was observed in cyanobacterial and water samples as shown by the amplification of the MC toxin synthetase genes mcyB and mcyD by standard PCR. The goal of this study was to develop a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) based on the 16S rDNA and mcyD gene sequences of Microcystis found in the SFE to quantify the proportion of toxic Microcystis with mcyD genes among total Microcystis or cyanobacterial population. Cyanobacterial samples collected by diagonal net tows of the water column showed that the ratio of gene copies was dominant for Microcystis among cyanobacteria (28-96%), and Microcystis carrying mcyD genes formed 0.4-20% of the total Micro cystis spp. Total Microcystis was also abundant (7.7 x 10(4) to 9.9 x 10(7) cells L-1) in ambient surface waters, and the range of Microcystis cell equivalents with mcyD genes (4.1 x 10(2) to 2.2 x 10(7) cells L-1) indicated a large variation in the ratio of toxic Microcystis among total Microcystis (0.01-27%). Differences in the proportion of toxic and nontoxic Microcystis, as deduced from the cell equivalents of total Micro cystis, were observed across the sampling locations and seasons where concentrations of total MCs (0.007-10.81 mu g/L) also varied. By revealing trends in the sources and magnitude of toxic and nontoxic Microcystis, qPCR can contribute to rapid risk assessment and prediction of strategies designed to manage the adverse effects of cyanobacterial blooms in the SFE.

While the estimation of lake area has recently improved, the determination of the lake volume is essential to properly estimate the amount of water contained in and lost from supraglacial lakes throughout the melt seasons. In this study, four supraglacial lake depth estimation methods, including two new empirical approaches, are presented and compared. The empirical methods were developed to relate Sentinel-2 reflectance values to supraglacial lake depth obtained from (1) ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite 2) crossings over 19 lakes in Northeast and Southwest Greenland and (2) in situ sonar tracks from four lakes on Zachariae Isstrom (Zachari ae Isstr & oslash;m) in Northeast Greenland. The depths from both equations were independently correlated to their corresponding Sentinel-2 reflectance values to create empirical relations. The third method is a standardly used radiative transfer model also based on Sentinel-2 data. Finally, the depths for five lakes in Northeast Greenland were derived from TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement) digital elevation models after lake drainage. All four methods were applied to the five lakes for which digital elevation models were procured, allowing for a direct comparison of the methods. In general, the sonar-based empirical equation aligned best with the estimates from the digital elevation model until its saturation point of 8.6 m. Through the evaluation of the ICESat-2-based equation, a strong influence of lake bed sediment on depth estimation could be seen. The ICESat-2 empirically derived depth equation produced slightly deeper depths than the sonar-based equation. The radiative transfer model more strongly overestimated nearly all depths below its saturation point of 16.3 m, when compared to the digital elevation model results. This large overestimation can be primarily attributed to the sensitivity of this method's parameters. Furthermore, all methods, with the exception of the digital elevation model, were applied to an area in Northeast Greenland on the peak melt dates for the years 2016-2022 to explore lake volume interannual variability. Finally, a closer examination of the uncertainties for each method provides insight into associated errors and limitations when considering which method to use for supraglacial lake depth estimation. Overall, empirically derived equations are shown to be capable of simplifying supraglacial lake depth calculations while also retaining sufficient accuracy under low-sediment, floating-ice-free, and atmospherically clear conditions.

A valid cost-effective alternative for the analysis of zooplankton species richness is represented by the study of their diapausing propagules. This method allows retrieving in a single sampling the same number of species found in the water column over a period of many years. However, the lack of a reference database of diapausing propagules' diagnostic characters has, so far, precluded the use of morphology for the identification of egg species. In the present study, an analysis of the morphological characters of rotifer and cladoceran diapausing propagules was performed with Light Microscope (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to identify possible diagnostic features that would allow identification of their species without having to incubate the sediment first to obtain adults that can be identified. A total of 3780 diapausing eggs of 23 species of rotifers and cladocerans, collected in eleven lakes from five different regions of Spain and Mexico, were morphologically analyzed. High evidence of species-specificity was observed in most rotifer species, while cladoceran diapausing propagules could be only identified to genus level.

Rice plantation promoted greater abundance of amoA (AOA and AOB) and nirK(denitrifiers) genes in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil, showing a profound rhizosphere effect. Rice growing stages significantly affected the structures and abundances of AOB and denitrifier (nirK) communities in the rhizosphere, whereas no effect was observed on the community structure and abundance of AOA in the rhizosphere. Moreover, the amoA gene copy numbers of AOA were more than those of AOB in all soil samples. However, denitrifier (nirK) generally dominated the ammonia oxidizer (amoA) in the rhizosphere during all growth stages, suggesting better adaptability of denitrifier in the rice rhizosphere environment. These results further suggest that AOB and denitrifier (nirK) communities associated with rice rhizosphere are highly dynamic in response to prevailing plant and soil conditions over a rice crop season, whereas AOA showed higher stability throughout the rice growing period.

J	Ding, J; Zhang, Y; Guo, Y; Ma, N				Ding, Jie; Zhang, Yinsheng; Guo, Yanhong; Ma, Ning			Quantitative comparison of river inflows to a rapidly expanding lake in central Tibetan Plateau	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The recent rapid expansion of inland lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are a good indicator of the consequences of climate change. Quantifying the hydrological cycle of the lake basin is fundamentally important to understand the causes of lake growth. However, the hydrological processes of the TP interior are very complex and difficult to investigate because of the lack of observations. This is especially true for estimating the lake changes when run-off inflows are affected by small lakes located in the flow routes within drainage areas. We used an integrated hydrological model, in combination with glacier melt and lake retention models, to analyse the run-off inflows to Lake Siling Co, the largest endorheic lake in Tibet. It includes four subdrainage basins: Zhajiazangbu, Zhagenzangbu, Alizangbu, and Boquzangbu. Lake Siling Co was characterized by considerable increases during warm season from 1981 to 2012, due to the increased run-off from Zhajiazangbu accounting for about 51-62% of the total run-off inflows. Moreover, the dramatic increases exhibited during cold seasons were related to the increased retention water released from the small lakes within Zhagenzangbu and Alizangbu. Of the studied subdrainage basins, Boquzangbu contributed the least during both warm and cold seasons. On average, the annual amount of evaporation from lakes within the drainage area was about 2 times greater than that of glacier melt run-off. Our results suggest that the retention effects of lakes on river inflows should receive more attention, because understanding these effects is potentially crucial to improved understanding of lake variations in the TP.

In this study, hydrological, thermal and isotopic investigations were undertaken to provide evidence for the mixing in the large, shallow floodplain Poyang Lake (China). Depth profiles of water velocity, water temperature and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions were measured throughout the lake, with results showing that the water velocity differences in depth profiles are generally less than similar to 0.2 m/s, indicating weak stratification. Although water temperature differences of up to similar to 2 degrees C are observed occasionally, Poyang Lake appears to have isothermal mixed layers from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion, attributed to the presence of mostly small temperature differences (<1 degrees C). Additionally, isotope compositions reveal that the lake's water columns are almost homogeneous during various water-level periods. Relative to many lakes exhibiting either no mixing or partial mixing, Poyang Lake appears to be fully mixing on a seasonal basis, depending on hydrological forcings within the lake rather than meteorological conditions. The current study will help to improve our knowledge of water flow patterns and pollutant transport in Poyang Lake and other similar floodplain lakes.

Previous studies utilized several methods of estimating nitrate accumulation in soil and leaching to groundwater under intensive vegetable cultivation, such as comparing intensive cropping to non-intensive cropping, or investigating the seasonal dynamics of soil nitrates in the short term, such as 1 or 2 years. This study tried to utilize a different method, considering the effects of total nitrogen (N) input during the whole vegetable cropping phase (up to 9 years) after conversion from traditional cereal cropping on soil and groundwater. A large-scale investigation was performed in the study area. Vegetable, soil, and groundwater samples were collected from 22 fields. Results showed that soil nitrate was significantly correlated with total N input from chemical fertilizer during the whole vegetable cropping phase, and groundwater nitrate was significantly correlated with soil nitrate. Nitrate concentration in 45 % of wells exceeded the drinking water maximum contaminant level, 10 mg L-1. These results suggest that soil nitrate accumulation in the area resulted from long-term application of large amounts of N chemical fertilizer, and not from manure. Furthermore, high irrigation levels caused the accumulated nitrate in soil to leach into the groundwater, resulting in nitrate contamination of the groundwater.					; Tanaka, Takashi/AAE-7491-2019	Tanaka, Takashi/0000-0001-7116-6962; 													1385-1314	1573-0867				DEC	2016	106	3					325	334		10.1007/s10705-016-9807-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-016-9807-9													WOS:000388121500005

The idea of an early deglaciation, leading to a glacier-free period in mid-Holocene, followed by the Neoglaciation is still the main concept for the glacial history in the North Atlantic region, including Iceland. We have examined a continuous sediment record from the glacier-fed Lake Logurinn in eastern Iceland to infer Holocene meltwater variability of Eyjabakkajokull, which is a surge-type outlet glacier of the Vatnajokull ice cap. We focus on the early and mid-Holocene, and our data show that Eyjabakkajokull receded rapidly during the final phase of the last deglaciation, and did not deliver glacial meltwater to Lake Logurinn by 9000 years BP, suggesting that Eyjabakkajokull was significantly smaller than today at that time. The return of glacial meltwater transport to Lake Logurinn, and thus a return of Eyjabakkajokull is dated to ca 4400 years BP, suggesting an almost 5000 years long glacier-free period during early and mid-Holocene. During this time period, we infer that the 8.2 ka cold event did not cause a significant expansion of Eyjabakkajokull, however, we note a marked decrease in the aquatic productivity in Lake Logurinn, which is suggested to be the result of shorter ice-free seasons of Lake Logurinn. The Holocene Thermal Maximum is inferred by a period of maximum Holocene aquatic productivity, and dated to ca 7900-7000 years BP. Following the re-formation of Eyjabakkajokull ca 4400 years BP, we suggest that the glacier reached stable conditions ca 1700 years BP, and remained fairly stable until the later part of the Little Ice Age, when Eyjabakkajokull reached its maximum Holocene extent.

These data were analyzed in a geographic information system environment together with relevant data sets (e. g., topography, geology, remote sensing) to assess the utility of GRACE for monitoring elements of hydrologic systems on local scales. The following were observed over the Niger, Congo, and Nile Basins: (1) large persistent anomalies (standard deviation, SD > 10 cm) on SD images over periods of 2-7 yr; (2) anomalous areas originate at mountainous source areas that receive high precipitation, extend downslope toward mountain foothills, and often continue along main channels, wetlands, or lakes that drain these areas; (3) time-series analyses over anomalous areas showed that seasonal mass variation lags behind seasonal precipitation; and (4) seasonal mass variations showed progressive shift in phase and decrease in amplitude with distance from the mountainous source areas. Results indicate that (1) the observed temporal mass variations are largely controlled by elements of the hydrologic cycle (e. g., runoff, infiltration, groundwater flow) and have not been obscured by noise, as previously thought; and (2) it is possible to use GRACE to investigate the temporal local responses of a much larger suite of hydrologic systems (watersheds, lakes, rivers, and marshes) and domains (source areas and lowlands) within watersheds and subbasins worldwide.

Short-term variation in thermal stratification complicates estimation of lake metabolism	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Previous studies have used sondes to measure diel changes in dissolved oxygen and thereby estimate gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP). Most of these studies estimate rates for the surface layer and require knowing the depth of the mixed layer (Z(mix)), which is usually determined from discrete daily or weekly temperature profiles. However, Z(mix) is dynamic, as the thermal structure of lakes may change at scales of minutes rather than days or weeks. We studied two thermally stratified lakes that exhibited intermittent microstratification in the mixed layer. We combined sonde-based estimates of metabolism with high-frequency measurements of stratification using thermistor chains to determine how the short-term dynamics of stratification affect metabolic rates. We calculated estimates of metabolism using time series of Z(mix) measured at seasonal, weekly, daily, and 5-min intervals. Areal rates of GPP and R were up to 24 and 29% less, respectively, using the 5-min measurements of Z(mix) rather than weekly Z(mix), while NEP was not significantly different. These reduced areal rates are mostly the consequence of the reduction in the depth of the mixed layer. Microstratification occurred frequently in both lakes and affected volumetric rates in one lake where R was significantly lower, NEP was significantly higher, and GPP was marginally lower compared to days without microstratification. Hence, microstratification not only affects the depth of the mixed layer, but also alters the processes that influence photosynthesis and respiration. Future studies should consider microstratification and possibly employ multiple sondes with thermistor chains that enable integrating metabolic rates to a specific depth, rather than assuming a stable upper mixed layer as the basis for calculations.

An algorithm was developed to estimate TSI using in-situ observed SDT and band ratio of Landsat-8 OLI in exponential mode (R-2 = 0.72). Different interpolation methods have been applied and the best one was considered to prepare two dimensional water quality images of the lake. The in-situ and satellite observed, TSI value shows the northern sector is always in eutrophic to hypereutrophic condition. During pre-monsoon season of 2015 the southern sector shows lake water is eutrophic condition. The analysis of satellite image indicate the lake water is in eutrophic condition from the year 2006 to 2015. However, the average TSI values were comparatively less during post-monsoon season of 2013 and 2015.

Crustal migration of CO2-rich magmatic fluids recorded by tree-ring radiocarbon and seismicity at Mammoth Mountain, CA, USA	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Unrest at Mammoth Mountain over the past several decades, manifest by seismicity, ground deformation, diffuse CO2 emissions, and elevated He-3/He-4 ratios in fumarolic gases has been driven by the release of CO2-rich fluids from basaltic intrusions in the middle to lower crust. Recent unrest included the occurrence of three lower-crustal (32-19 km depth) seismic swarms beneath Mammoth Mountain in 2006, 2008 and 2009 that were consistently followed by peaks in the occurrence rate of shallow (<= 10 km depth) earthquakes. We measured C-14 in the growth rings (1998-2012) of a tree growing in the largest (similar to 0.3 km(2)) area of diffuse CO2 emissions on Mammoth Mountain (the Horseshoe Lake tree kill; HLTK) and applied atmospheric CO2 concentration source area modeling to confirm that the tree was a reliable integrator of magmatic CO2 emissions over most of this area. The tree-ring C-14 record implied that magmatic CO2 emissions from the HLTK were relatively stable from 1998 to 2009, nearly doubled from 2009 to 2011, and then declined by the 2012 growing season. The initial increase in CO2 emissions was detected during the growing season that immediately followed the largest (February 2010) peak in the occurrence rate of shallow earthquakes. Migration of CO2-rich magmatic fluids may have driven observed patterns of elevated deep, then shallow seismicity, while the relationship between pore fluid pressures within a shallow (upper 3 km of crust) fluid reservoir and permeability structure of the reservoir cap rock may have controlled the temporal pattern of surface CO2 emissions.

Model performance was in most cases good (61% of gauging stations had a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient >0.60) but nevertheless showed a large seasonal and georegion specific bias. Therefore, bias correction factors had to be developed before applying the DK-model simulations of runoff in the ungauged areas. Simulated monthly runoff from ungauged areas and the measured monthly runoff from 178 gauging stations were distributed to 2663 smaller Hydrological Units (ca. 15 km(2)) and linked with a new empirical model for flow-weighted monthly total nitrogen (TN) concentrations (R(2) 0.43; P < 0.0001) developed based on 20 years of observations (1990-2009) in 83 small catchments for calculation of monthly gross diffuse TN-loads from HU's. Nitrogen retention was calculated in streams, lakes and wetlands utilising both lake specific models and rate coefficients to calculate N retention in surface water bodies. The whole model complex was linked in the DK-QN concept for simulation of monthly TN losses from point sources and diffuse sources, TN retention and resulting loadings to Danish coastal waters. The DK-QN model was validated in 118 gauged catchments and the model simulations had for >25% of the observations of monthly discharge weighted TN concentrations a NS larger than 0.26. Catchment specific monthly TN-loadings were modelled with a higher performance as 50% of the catchments had a NS greater than 0.75. The model concept allows calculation of N retention in streams, lakes and wetlands and the average annual model calculated N retention amounted to 21% of the modelled gross riverine TN loadings. The average annual gross TN loading to surface freshwater in Denmark derived from diffuse sources amounted to 97 000 tonnes N (91% of gross TN loadings) which is 54% of the total estimated N-leaching from the root zone on the Danish land area (212 000 tonnes N) during the period 1990-2009.					; Thodsen, Hans/K-5786-2013; kronvang, brian/I-7715-2013; Larsen, Soren E./J-6754-2013; Larsen, Søren/J-6754-2013; troldborg, lars/G-8754-2018	Larsen, Soren Erik/0000-0001-8428-2065; Thodsen, Hans/0000-0002-6542-4934; Larsen, Soren E./0000-0003-4570-9489; troldborg, lars/0000-0002-7366-1438													1464-0325					SEP	2011	13	9					2645	2658		10.1039/c1em10139k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10139k								21842096					WOS:000294436200035

Low Taxon Richness of Bacterioplankton in High-Altitude Lakes of the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, with a Predominance of Bacteroidetes and Synechococcus spp.	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Plankton samples were collected from six remote freshwater and saline lakes located at altitudes of 3,204 to 4,718 m and 1,000 km apart within an area of ca. 1 million km(2) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to comparatively assess how environmental factors influence the diversity of bacterial communities in high-altitude lakes. The composition of the bacterioplankton was investigated by analysis of large clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes. Comparison of bacterioplankton diversities estimated for the six Tibetan lakes with reference data previously published for lakes located at lower altitudes indicated relatively low taxon richness in the Tibetan lakes. The estimated average taxon richness in the four Tibetan freshwater lakes was only one-fifth of the average taxon richness estimated for seven low-altitude reference lakes. This cannot be explained by low coverage of communities in the Tibetan lakes by the established libraries or by differences in habitat size. Furthermore, a comparison of the taxonomic compositions of bacterioplankton across the six Tibetan lakes revealed low overlap between their community compositions. About 70.9% of the operational taxonomic units (99% similarity) were specific to single lakes, and a relatively high percentage (11%) of sequences were <95% similar to publicly deposited sequences of cultured or uncultured bacteria. This beta diversity was explained by differences in salinity between lakes rather than by distance effects. Another characteristic of the investigated lakes was the predominance of Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) and Bacteroidetes. These features of bacterioplankton diversity may reflect specific adaptation of various lineages to the environmental conditions in these high-altitude lakes.					xing, peng/HDM-6843-2022; Hahn, Martin/B-9998-2008; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011; Hahn, Martin W./B-9998-2008	Xing, Peng/0000-0002-4917-5181; Hahn, Martin W./0000-0003-0501-2556													0099-2240	1098-5336				NOV 15	2009	75	22					7017	7025		10.1128/AEM.01544-09	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01544-09								19767472					WOS:000271526800009

Ultraviolet absorbance as a proxy for total dissolved mercury in streams	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Stream water samples were collected over a range of hydrologic and seasonal conditions at three forested watersheds in the northeastern USA. Samples were analyzed for dissolved total mercury (THgd), DOC concentration and DOC composition, and UV254 absorbance across the three sites over different seasons and flow conditions. Pooling data from all sites, we found a strong positive correlation of THgd to DOC (r(2) = 0.87), but progressively stronger correlations of THgd with the hydrophobic acid fraction (HPOA) of DOC (r(2) = 0.91) and with UV254 absorbance (r(2) = 0.92). The strength of the UV254 absorbance-THgd relationship suggests that optical properties associated with dissolved organic matter may be excellent proxies for THgd concentration in these streams. Ease of sample collection and analysis, the potential application of in-situ optical sensors, and the possibility for intensive monitoring over the hydrograph make this an effective, inexpensive approach to estimate THgd flux in drainage waters.

Impacts and adaptation options of climate change on ecosystem services in Finland: a model based study	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												At a global level, it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of ecosystem services have been degraded in just fifty years. The additional stresses imposed by climate change will require extraordinary adaptation. This paper synthesises main result of a large Finnish project studying the vulnerability of key ecosystem services to climate change and the possibilities for the individual sectors to adapt to these changes. The project based its work on data and infrastructures of nine intensively studied areas belonging to the Finnish LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network. The methods developed and used included remote sensing, derivation of impact scenarios, dynamic modelling, laboratory experiments, interactive workshops and expert judgement. The results clearly indicated not only complex interactions between the different ecosystem processes but also trade-offs between the ecosystem services. Climate change was predicted to have both positive and negative effects on key ecosystem services in Finnish conditions, the results being sector-specific and scenario-specific. Provisioning services like food and timber production would largely benefit from increasing temperatures. and prolongation of the growing season in the cool Finnish conditions (with e.g. estimated increases in growth rates of trees up to 80% and the introduction of a wider selection of crops), although increasing occurrence of factors such as fungal diseases and insect outbreaks were estimated to cause increasing risks. On the other hand, climate change was predicted to pose a major threat to several endangered and valuable species, water and air quality, and tourism services dependent on present climate conditions. Goal conflicts between maximising service production and meeting environmental quality objectives were also identified. Adaptation options and impact thresholds identified together with local enterprises and experts are presented.					; Setälä, Heikki/P-7354-2015; Hakola, Hannele/N-7502-2014; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Helenius, Juha/0000-0001-6933-404X; Arvola, Lauri/0000-0003-1380-0659; Nikinmaa, Eero/0000-0003-4956-3069; Rankinen, Katri/0000-0001-8744-1420; Setala, Heikki Martti/0000-0002-5230-4001; Forsius, Martin/0000-0003-0125-5120; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174; Hyvarinen, Marko/0000-0001-8736-0946; Anttila, Saku/0000-0001-7013-9575													1877-3435	1877-3443				MAR	2013	5	1					26	40		10.1016/j.cosust.2013.01.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.01.001													WOS:000317326900005

T.			Reservoir operation impacts on streamflow and sediment dynamics in the transboundary river basin, Vietnam	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Human interventions activities around the world, particularly reservoir operation, have dramatically altered hydrological and sediment regimes in most of the major river basins. In the Mekong River, specifically the Upper Srepok River Basin (USRB) which is a main tributary of the river basin connected to the Mekong Delta's rice bowl and the Tonle Sap Lake's top inland fisheries, there are increasing concerns about the impacts of cascade reservoir operations on downstream streamflow and sediment budgets. Previous studies estimating impacts either relied solely on observed data or did not verify simulations of regulated streamflow. Using a process-based hydrological model calibrated and validated for both natural and regulated streamflow in the USRB, it was found that the monthly hydrological changes were up to & PLUSMN;20% compared to pre-dam periods at the most downstream station bordering between Vietnam and Cambodia (i.e., Ban Don station). The basin also experienced a slight decrease (less than 2%) in annual streamflow. Additionally, average and peak suspended sediment concentration decreased significantly in both of the annual and seasonal periods. At the Ban Don station, sediment loads were reduced 140 thousand tons/year (i.e., 15%) compared to pre-dam period. Most of the changes in streamflow and sediment budgets in the basin were driven by the Buon Tua Srah reservoir, which had the highest degree of regulation in the basin. Therefore, integrated and transboundary water and sediment management, particularly at Buon Tua Srah reservoir, needs to be developed for the sustainability of the river basin. The Srepok_HYPE model can provide useful information to support the decision-making process for water and sediment management in the basin.For seasonal effects on stream flows, the reservoirs within the USRB increased the low flows in the dry season and decreased the high flows in the wet season up to & PLUSMN;20% at Ban Don.Regarding the impacts of reservoir operations on SSC, average and maximum SSC decreased dramatically in both of the annual and seasonal periods.image					Saber, Mohamed/H-8261-2019; Van Binh, Doan/AAY-3488-2020; Du, Tien/GLN-6490-2022; Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021; Bartosova, Alena/HSC-1368-2023; Saleh, Ali/KRO-5192-2024	Bartosova, Alena/0009-0006-2983-9231; Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				SEP	2023	37	9							e14994	10.1002/hyp.14994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14994													WOS:001066328100001

An in-depth understanding of the change mechanisms of DIC concentrations and sources driven by dam operation and lake recharge is crucial for regulating greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating the impact of DIC on the global carbon cycle. This study investigated dam- and lakes-driven DIC via the concentration and delta C-13 of DIC, combined with anions, cations, delta D and delta O-18 in the main stream of the Yangtze River. DIC showed a decreasing trend from upper reach (2,262.31 +/- 113.69 mu mol kg(-1)) to lower reach (1,771.61 +/- 89.36 mu mol kg(-1)). Carbonate dissolution proportion (from 36.45% to 28.44%) and atmospheric CO2 proportion (from 37.51% to 22.94%) of DIC decreased from upper reach to lower reach, whereas soil CO2 proportion of DIC (from 26.01% to 48.63%) increased. The control of dam operation on DIC biogeochemical process was revealed from different time scales. From the perspective of short-term seasonal changes (from 2020 to 2021), the mineralization of organic matter in the dry season strengthened CO2 degassing and calcite precipitation, reducing the DIC and increasing the proportion of soil CO2. Meanwhile, longer periods of runoff retention provided sufficient time for water-rock reactions in the wet season and increased the DIC and carbonate dissolution source in the reservoir area. On a long-term scale (from 2009 to 2021), a decrease in pH driven by sediment mineralization contributed to an annual increase in DIC in the reservoir. The flow of lakes mixed into the mainstream was revealed by the enrichment of delta O-18, and river-communicating recharge decreased the DIC and carbonate dissolution source. We show that dam operation and lake inflow change DIC concentrations and sources and therefore need to be considered in the transmission and transformation processes of DIC in the river-ocean continuum.

When the water level recedes, lakes and channels are formed as individual systems. Therefore, we expected the spatial heterogeneity during the low water phase resulting in changes on biological communities leading to high phytoplankton abundance, biomass and diversity within and between habitats. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed eight freshwater systems (five oxbow lakes, two channels, and the river) during the low water period. Phytoplankton biomass, abundance, diversity (alpha, beta, gamma) and diversity metrics as richness (species per sample), Shannon diversity (H') and evenness were measured in all systems along with nutrient concentrations, zooplankton and bacteria abundances. We found 97 species as gamma diversity. The alpha diversity was unexpectedly low in comparison to most other South American floodplain systems (38 species in river, 24 in channels and 29 in lakes). Also, the systems are relatively similar in composition (beta diversity, 28%). Connectivity differences between systems highlighted differences in phytoplankton abundance and biomass (fresh weight) ranging from 1428 ind mL(-1) (river) to 3710 ind mL(-1) (lakes) and from 0.71 mg L-1 (river) to 2.9 mg L-1 (lakes), respectively. However, our results did not indicate significant differences in phytoplankton species richness between the systems during the low water. Our main conclusions are that local factors may be responsible for changes on phytoplankton community and the time of isolation during the low water phase was not sufficient to promote changes in phytoplankton diversity between the habitats.

The aim was to provide evidence concerning the origin of the organic matter (OM) and its compositional diversity in surface deposits of this very productive, highly dynamic water body. The content and composition of the OM in the bottom sediments were investigated at 11 sampling stations throughout the lake basin. OM sources were assigned on the basis of bulk indicators [ total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15 and extractable OM yield], biomarker composition of extractable OM and compound-specific C isotope signatures. The source characterization of autochthonous compounds was verified via phytoplankton analysis. The distribution of gaseous hydrocarbons in the sediments, as well as temporal changes in lake water pH, the concentration of DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) and delta C-13(DIC) were used to trace OM decomposition. The sedimentary OM is composed mainly of well preserved phytoplankton compounds and shows minor spatial variability in composition. However, the presence of CH4 and CO2 in the bottom deposits provides evidence for microbial degradation of sedimentary OM. The transformation of organic compounds in surface, bottom and pore waters via oxidative processes influences carbonate equilibrium in the lake and seasonally favours precipitation or dissolution of CaCO3. The data enhance our understanding of the relationships between the composition of sedimentary OM and environmental conditions within coastal ecosystems and shed light on the reliability of OM proxies for environmental reconstruction of coastal lakes.

Hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes along the lower Guadalupe River, Texas: The influence of geomorphic and climatic controls on the "flood pulse concept"	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrologic connectivity between rivers and floodplains is fundamental to the ecological integrity of meandering river corridors. This study integrates two important concepts in floodplain hydrology; the flood pulse concept and the oxbow lake cycle. High temporal resolution (0.5-3.0 h) lake level data from vented pressure transducers and river discharge data (0.25 h resolution) were utilized to develop standardized indices of hydrologic connectivity for two oxbow lakes along the lower Guadalupe River, Texas over a 3.4 yr period. The lakes were influenced by hydrologic conditions representative of the northwestern Gulf region, notably a severe drought and a wet season associated with La Nina and El Nino, respectively. Because the data were obtained over the same period it enables a direct comparison of surficial hydrologic connectivity within the evolutionary geomorphic framework of the oxbow lake cycle. A recently (13 yr old) formed oxbow lake was connected 5.9 times per yr and an older partially infilled oxbow lake was connected 3.8 times per yr during the study period. Each oxbow lake was connected by discharge pulses below bankfull discharge, and the signature of hydrologic connectivity varied significantly. The flow duration for connectivity was 18% and 3% for the recently formed and older oxbow lake, respectively. Bivariate relations between discharge and lake stage varied significantly for the two oxbow lakes. The recently formed oxbow lake exhibited highly linear relations between discharge and lake levels, and lake drainage closely mirrored flood wave recession. Older oxbow lake connectivity was complex, as discharge and lake level relations were nonlinear and exhibited pronounced negative hysteresis, which increased with sequential flood pulses. While the older oxbow lake was more sensitive to short term low flow conditions, both lakes were completely desiccated during an extended La Nina influenced drought. This indicates a substantial impact to alluvial aquifers, which were unable to supply groundwater to oxbow lakes during extended dry periods. The "flood pulse concept" applied with only river discharge data is overly simplistic and does not adequately characterize hydrologic connectivity for distinct types of oxbow lakes along meandering river floodplains. With limited lake level data, however, great potential exists for development of effective "integrated floodplain management" plans that more appropriately considers variable hydrologic connectivity inherent within the oxbow lake cycle.

We, therefore, studied the spatial distribution patterns of different heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria, and the dominant primary producer, the filamentous cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, in a large, canyon-shaped, prealpine lake (Lake Zurich, Switzerland), in six vertical profiles along a 21.7-km longitudinal transect. Highest total densities and proportions of cells with high nucleic acid content were in the warm epilimnion and the hypoxic zone of the hypolimnion. P. rubescens formed a dense layer in the metalimnion throughout the lake, whereas picocyanobacteria populated the water layers above. The epilimnion was mainly inhabited by ultramicrobacteria related to the LD12-lineage of Alphaproteobacteria and to Actinobacteria; the latter group preferred the shallow regions. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria, in particular a population related to Fluviicola sp. were more frequent in and below the layer of maximal P. rubescens abundances. Betaproteobacteria, on the other hand, were highly abundant in the epi- and hypolimnion, but not in the P. rubescens layer. Four betaproteobacterial subpopulations with contrasting longitudinal and/or vertical habitat preferences were distinguished: putatively methylotrophic bacteria of the LD28 lineage (beta IV) preferentially inhabited the hypolimnion, Polynucleobacter acidiphobus was found throughout the epilimnion, Limnohabitans (R-BT065) more in the shallow regions of the lake, and Polynucleobacter necessarius ssp. asymbioticus only in hypoxic waters. Our results stress the potential importance of spatial niche differentiation in freshwater bacterioplankton.

Negative chemical interference has been invoked as one of the steering mechanisms behind mutual dominance of either submerged macrophytes or phytoplankton in shallow eutrophic lakes. Yet, despite much effort, convincing evidence for allelopathic interactions in situ is still missing. Also, laboratory approaches often lack reality. Inspired by a series of talks at the Shallow Lakes 2005 meeting in Dalfsen, the Netherlands, we argue that there is circumstantial but strong evidence that allelopathic interference between submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton may indeed exist in aquatic ecosystems despite the problems associated with research in this field. We first discuss experimental approaches combining laboratory and field studies, based on examples presented at this meeting. We then discuss the impact of nutrient status of both producing and target organism and biotic factors such as herbivory or pathogens that might affect allelopathy. Further topics are the potential seasonality of effects and the species-specificity of certain allelochemicals. We conclude with some thoughts why a final proof for allelopathy in situ might remain difficult or even inaccessible in some cases, and why we nevertheless should not abandon this idea.

Interannual dynamics and phenology of bacterial communities in a eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated patterns of intra- and interannual change in pelagic bacterial community composition (BCC, assessed using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) over six years in eutrophic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. A regular phenology was repeated across years, implying that freshwater bacterial communities are more predictable in their dynamics than previously thought. Seasonal events, such as water column mixing and trends in water temperature, were most strongly related to BCC variation. Communities became progressively less similar across years between the months of May and September, when the lake was thermally stratified. Dissolved oxygen and nitrate + nitrite concentrations were highly correlated to BCC change within and across seasons. The relationship between BCC and seasonal drivers suggests that trajectories of community change observed over long time series will reflect large-scale climate variation.					; Kent, Angela/D-6124-2011; Shade, Ashley/JOZ-2968-2023; McMahon, Katherine/I-3651-2012; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Kent, Angela/0000-0003-1837-2382; Shade, Ashley/0000-0002-7189-3067													0024-3590					MAR	2007	52	2					487	494		10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0487	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0487													WOS:000245145200001
J	Ragheb, ELH; Miller, KE; Kiltie, RA				Ragheb, Erin L. Hewett; Miller, Karl E.; Kiltie, Richard A.			Optimizing reproductive opportunity for Florida grasshopper sparrows: When to burn?	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The critically endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) is dependent on dry prairies managed with prescribed fires that are applied every 1-3 years. Timing of prescribed fires shifted from predominantly the dormant season (Jan-Mar) to the transition (Apr-Jun) and growing (Jul-Aug) seasons starting in the early 2000s to better mimic natural fire regimes. Populations have continued to decline, however, and the presumption that natural fire regimes are beneficial to the small extant Florida grasshopper sparrow populations needs to be evaluated. We monitored 167 Florida grasshopper sparrow nests across 6 fire treatments at Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area, Osceola County, Florida, USA, 2013-2016, and investigated the role of fire season and interval on clutch initiation date, nest site selection, nest survival, productivity, and nestling mass. Clutch initiation was delayed by >= 33 days in prairies burned during the current transition season and we found no nests in prairies burned during the current growing season. Transition season burns also overlapped with the early breeding season, which could result in the destruction of nests. Clutches were larger at the beginning of the breeding season and nestling mass was highest in the middle of the breeding season, indicating that early and mid-season nests may be more valuable to annual fecundity than late-season nests. Florida grasshopper sparrows nested in prairies burned in the current dormant season or previous growing season more than expected based on their availability and as expected or less than expected in prairies burned in the current transition season, previous transition season, previous dormant season, or >2 years ago. However, we found no effect of fire treatment on daily nest survival, clutch size, number of fledglings per successful nest, or nestling mass. We recommend dormant season burning in prairies occupied by Florida grasshopper sparrows to increase reproductive potential given the subspecies' small population and the importance of each nest attempt to population growth. We recommend transition or growing season burns in unoccupied adjacent prairies to maintain high-quality dry prairie for nesting in future years. Prescribed fire management goals for Florida grasshopper sparrow populations should be guided by demographic responses rather than natural fire regimes. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.

In our work we document the first successful large scale ex situ cultivation of the threatened species from Brazilian Amazon Isoetes cangae and Isoetes serracarajensis, which are endemic of a lake and close ponds nearby, respectively. This study aimed to develop the ex situ cultivation methods of the species I. cangae and I. serracarajensis. The capacity of regrowth and to tolerate high soluble iron in the water was monitored. We also studied plant leaf nutrition, growth, photosynthesis, and plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. Both species were cultivated in a low-cost system at a greenhouse during three seasons through a year. The survival rate of plants was higher as 98 %, and both species developed effectively on the culture system with different patterns during linear growth: I. cangae showed faster leaf growth but was slower on new leaves production compared to I. serracarajensis. The mechanism of leaf expansion seems to be related to H+-ATPase activation, near to 2-fold higher in I. cangae. Contrarily, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II was higher in I. serracarajensis than in I. cangae. Both species accumulate very high concentration of minerals in the leaf tissue, and I. serracarajensis presented more iron than I. cangae, and remarkably showed more new leaves on higher iron concentration exposure. I. cangae showed the ability to reproduce during ex situ cultivation. The results of this work have broad applicability, assisting other low-cost cultivation studies, which are critical to ecosystem recovery of mining areas and conservation strategies.

We collected sediments, suspended particulate material (SPM), and plankton from floodplain lakes and compared then to sediments from rivers and soils of the central Amazon basin by measuring concentrations of total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MMHg), and mercury isotope ratios. Concentrations of THg and MMHg in the lake sediments ranged to 69-109 ng g(-1) and 0.62-4.78 ng g(-1), respectively. A positive correlation between THg and MMHg in soils and sediments suggest that inorganic Hg in this system is highly bioavailable and readily converted to MMHg. delta Hg-202 values ranged from -1.40 parts per thousand to -0.89 parts per thousand and Delta Hg-199 from -0.34 parts per thousand to -0.18 parts per thousand. These values were comparable to those measured in riverine sediments (-2.14 parts per thousand to -1.23 parts per thousand and -0.51 parts per thousand to -0.05 parts per thousand), suggesting a contribution of riverine sediments to lake sediments, at least during the season of rising waters, during which lake samples were collected. SPM on the other hand was much elevated in THg (590-1066 ng g(-1)) and showed more negative delta Hg-202 (-3.00 to -2.15), similar to those found in soils (-2.99 parts per thousand to -2.17 parts per thousand), suggesting that Hg in SPM may originate from erosion of floodplain soils.

Here, we focus on the Aluto-Langano geothermal system, Ethiopia, where the climate is monsoonal and there is abundant shallow seismicity. We deployed temporary networks of seismometers and GPS receivers to understand the drivers of unrest. First, we show that a statistically significant peak in seismicity occurred 23 months after the main rainy season, with a second, smaller peak of variable timing. Seasonal seismicity is commonly attributed to variations in either surface loading or reservoir pore pressure. As loading will cause subsidence and overpressure will cause uplift, comparing seismicity rates with continuous GPS, enables us to distinguish between mechanisms. At Aluto, the major peak in seismicity is coincident with the high stand of nearby lakes and maximum subsidence, indicating that it is driven by surface loading. The magnitude of loading is insufficient to trigger widespread crustal seismicity but the geothermal reservoir at Aluto is likely sensitive to small perturbations in the stress field. Thus we demonstrate that monsoonal loading can produce seismicity in geothermal reservoirs, and the likelihood of both triggered and induced seismicity varies seasonally. (C) 2018 The Authors.

J	da Cunha, AC; Sternberg, LDL				da Cunha, Alan Cavalcanti; Lobo Sternberg, Leonel da Silveira			Using stable isotopes 18O and 2H of lake water and biogeochemical analysis to identify factors affecting water quality in four estuarine Amazonian shallow lakes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Stable isotopes analyses of oxygen and hydrogen of lake water were used to estimate the effect of evaporation (E) on the water quality of four shallow lakes in the Amapa State coastAmazon/Brazil. These lakes, with different size and hydrologic conditions, were sampled during the course of the 2015/2016 El-Nino (record-breaking warming/drought in the Amazon rainforest). Hydrometeorological and water quality parameters were simultaneously performed to the isotopic sampling. The results showed that the evaporation process and the water quality can be explained by climate season and distances from the Atlantic Ocean. Lake evaporation losses ranged from approximate to 0-22% during the wet season in April/2016 and approximate to 35.7% during the dry season in November/2015. As expected, the evaporation of lake water was greater during the dry season, but it was higher for lakes farther away from the Atlantic Ocean compared with more coastal lakes due to tidal preponderance and the influence of major river channels. The more inland estuarine lakes showed a lower level of salinity (0.00-0.03ppt) compared with those closer to the Atlantic Ocean (0.01-0.08ppt). The El Nino phenomenon, with a lower precipitation in the Amazon basin, may initiate salinization of lakes closer to the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, strong mean seasonal variations of evaporation (0.06E0.22) and other hydrologic parameters were observed (precipitation, water temperature, and water depth), with significant effects on the water quality such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll (p<.05). We conclude that the occurrence of the extreme climatic events can disrupt the biogeochemical and hydrological balance of these aquatic ecosystems and salinization of lakes closer to the Atlantic Ocean.					da Cunha, Alan/P-1215-2016														0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 30	2018	32	9					1188	1201		10.1002/hyp.11462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11462													WOS:000431002400006

Frequent changes in hydrologic properties are responsible factors for controlling the zooplankton community assemblages in both lakes, so we studied the possible influence of water transfer and environmental factors on zooplankton community structure and abundance. Zooplankton assemblages were investigated seasonally for one year in both lakes; a total of 133 and 122 zooplankton taxa were identified in Nansi Lake and Hongze Lake, respectively. The most dominant rotifer species were littoral, e.g., Keratella tecta, Keratella valga and Lecane lunaris in Nansi Lake and Brachionus angularis, Brachionus forficula and Polyarthra vulgaris in Hongze Lake. Comparatively, Nansi Lake had a higher Shannon-Wiener diversity index value (5.13), while Hongze Lake had a higher species richness index (4.21). The average number of zooplankton across seasons in Nansi Lake (protozoa: 774 +/- 63 ind./L, rotifers: 4 817 +/- 212 ind./L, cladocerans: 896 +/- 14 ind./L, copepod: 435 +/- 42 ind./L) was comparatively lower than Hongze Lake (protozoa: 1 238 +/- 63 ind./L, rotifers: 6 576 +/- 112 ind./L, cladocerans: 1 013 +/- 20 ind./L, copepod: 534 +/- 25 ind./L). Canonical correspondence analysis identified differing environmental gradients that were most responsible for influencing zooplankton communities in the two lakes (Hongze Lake: NH4-N, total nitrogen, transparency and pH; Nansi: pH, temperature and total phosphorus). Frequent changes related to water transfer in lakes favoured the diversity of rotifers and protozoa communities. Zooplankton habitat preference, changes in community structure and opportunistic peaks and extinction of certain taxa were also observed in the study lakes.					; RADHAKRISHNAN, DIVYA/AAV-6190-2020	Thundiparambil Sathrajith, Arunjith/0009-0005-6366-8248; K.R, Divya/0000-0001-7614-2986; cheng, fei/0000-0002-5894-1618; Qin, Jiao/0000-0002-4548-1093; 													2096-5508	2523-3521				MAR	2021	39	2					623	636		10.1007/s00343-020-9288-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-9288-1		MAY 2020											WOS:000531140500001

Diets of crustacean zooplankton, inferred from stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, in lakes with varying allochthonous dissolved organic carbon content	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses to estimate the relative proportions of three putative food sources (1) algae, (2) allochthonous organic matter (but including also heterotrophic bacteria and green-sulphur bacteria having similar isotopic values) and (3) methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in the diets of crustacean zooplankton in five small boreal lakes representing a gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration from ca. 5 to 40 mg C l(-1). The lakes were sampled in May, after establishment of stratification, and again in October during autumnal mixing of the water column. IsoSource mixing model outputs indicated that the proportion of algae in the diets of zooplankton was generally higher in May than in October, and that bacteria contributed to the diets of both cladocerans and copepods. Our results indicate that bacteria, especially MOB, can make an appreciable contribution to zooplankton diets in these small lakes, even in those with relatively low DOC concentrations.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2010	44	4					781	795		10.1007/s10452-010-9316-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9316-x													WOS:000285339300012

Using Remote Sensing to Aid the Assessment of Human Health Risks from Blooms of Potentially Toxic Cyanobacteria	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mass populations of toxic cyanobacteria in recreational waters can present a serious risk to human health. Intelligence on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is therefore needed to aid risk assessment and management activities. In this paper, we use data from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager-2 (CASI-2) to monitor seasonal change in the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment C-phycocyanin (C-PC) in a series of shallow lakes in the UK. The World Health Organization guidance levels for cyanobacteria in recreational waters were subsequently used to build a decision tree classification model for cyanobacterial risk assessment which was driven using Chl a and C-PC products derived from the CASI-2 data. The results demonstrate that remote sensing can be used to acquire intelligence on the distribution and abundance of cyanobacteria in inland waterbodies. It is argued the use of remote sensing reconnaissance, in conjunction with in situ based monitoring approaches, would greatly aid the assessment of cyanobacterial risks in inland waters and improve our ability to protect human health.

To test how the availability of either pure phenol or natural humic matter (HM) selects for specific pelagic bacteria phylotypes from a humic lake (Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle, northeastern Germany), we used culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Using a batch approach, the bacterial community composition (BCC) differed depending on both the quantity and the quality of added substrates. Using a dilution-to-extinction approach, distinct BCC were detected by eliminating less abundant species. Most bacteria that were common in the lake were favored by phenol, and yet different subsets of the native BCC were enriched by HM. Specific bacterial groups with different growth requirements were consistently present, negatively influenced, or positively enriched following substrate additions. This study comprises the first explicit demonstration that bacteria such as Methylobacterium, Methylophilus, and Methylosinus spp. can be enriched on phenol or HM. Our isolation approaches led to the successful cultivation of a variety of native bacteria from the lake, such as Novosphingobium (Alphaproteobacteria) and Flexibacter (Bacteroidetes), or phenol-utilizing bacteria such as members of Actinobacteria or Burkholderia (Betaproteobacteria). Enrichment and cultivation on phenol and HM as substrates revealed highly specialized bacterial communities that resemble those found in many HM-rich lakes.

Fatty Acid Composition and Contents of Seven Commercial Fish Species of Genus Coregonus from Russian Subarctic Water Bodies	LIPIDS												In several Russian northern lakes and rivers, Arctic cisco Coregonus autumnalis, least cisco C. sardinella, peled C. peled, tugun C. tugun, broad whitefish C. nasus, whitefish C. lavaretus and vendace C. albula were sampled in periods of officially permitted commercial fishery. Special attention was paid to contents (mg g(-1) of wet weight) of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in muscle tissues (filets), which are essential for human nutrition. The highest values of EPA + DHA content in semi-anadromous fish and freshwater fish were recorded for C. autumnalis from the Yenisei River, 17.60 mg g(-1) wet weight, and for C. lavaretus from the Sobachye Lake, 16.61 mg g(-1) wet weight, respectively. Intra-genus variations of EPA + DHA contents of Coregonus species were from 1.87 to 17.60 mg g(-1) wet weight. Since the congeneric species were genetically close to each other, the variations in EPA and DHA contents were thought to be caused primarily by ecological factors: migrational capability, type of feeding and trophic status of aquatic ecosystems. In general, the majority of studied species appeared to be of a high nutritive value for humans, although unfavorable environmental conditions could considerably diminish this value.

The present work aims to assess the degree to which common annual periodic behavior is present (1994-2010) in the meteorological parameters (global radiation, air temperature, cloud cover), streamflow; and five primary nutrients (e.g. total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen) as possible indicators of ecosystem vulnerability in four different ecosystems using wavelet coherence analysis. The cascade system is located in the mouth of a shallow river where the water flows through a eutrophic pond then a disturbed/undisturbed macrophyte covered wetland reaching a large shallow lake. The results highlight the differing abilities of the elements of the cascade of ecosystems to follow seasonality. The changes in water quality (nutrient cycle) in the eutrophic pond most closely mirror meteorological seasonality. The vulnerability of the wetland ecosystem was expressed by its decreased capacity to follow seasonal changes due to high algae loads and additional inflows. Moreover, the wetland proved to be weak and unstable regarding phosphorus and nitrogen retention. With the successful application of wavelet coherence analysis to the "black-box" cascade system the study sets an example for the implications of the method in such combined or stand-alone natural/partially-constructed ecosystems.

The effects of fluctuating temperature regimes on the embryonic development of lake whitefish (&ITCoregonus clupeaformis&IT)	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Fluctuating incubation temperatures may have significant effects on fish embryogenesis; yet most laboratory-based studies use constant temperatures. For species that experience large, natural seasonal temperature changes during embryogenesis, such as lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), seasonal temperature regimes are likely optimal for development. Anthropogenic activities can increase average and/or variability of natural incubation temperatures over large (e.g. through climate change) or smaller (e.g. thermal effluent discharge) geographic scales. To investigate this, we incubated lake whitefish embryos under constant (2, 5, or 8 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature regimes. Fluctuating temperature regimes had a base temperature of 2 degrees C with: 1) seasonal temperature changes that modeled natural declines/inclines; 2) tri-weekly +3 degrees C, 1 h temperature spikes; or 3) both seasonal temperature changes and temperature spikes. We compared mortality to hatch, morphometries, and heart rate at three developmental stages. Mortality rate was similar for embryos incubated at constant 2 degrees C, constant 5 degrees C, or with seasonal temperatures, but was significantly greater at constant 8 degrees C. Embryos incubated constantly at > 2 degrees C had reduced body growth and yolk consumption compared to embryos incubated with seasonal temperature changes. When measured at the common base temperature of 2 degrees C, embryos incubated at constant 2 degrees C had lower heart rates than embryos incubated with both seasonal temperature changes and temperature spikes. Our study suggests that incubating lake whitefish embryos with constant temperatures may significantly alter development, growth, and heart rate compared to incubating with seasonal temperature changes, emphasizing the need to include seasonal temperature changes in laboratory-based studies.

The identification of the critical width of the lakeshore zone remains a challenge due to natural geographic features and pollutant types, that is why a general identification approach has yet to be developed. To facilitate the planning of lakeshore restoration plans, it becomes necessary to conduct studies focusing on the development of relationships between water quality and landscape factors within the lakeshore zone in different regions. In this study, spatio-temporal patterns of water quality of 49 lakes in Western Jilin Province, China, were determined through field monitoring from 2015 to 2019. Multivariate statistical methods were applied to quantitatively identify the relationships between lakes water quality and landscape factors within lakeshore zones of different widths. The results indicated that ni-trogen (N) contributed more to eutrophication, while fluoride concentrations were found to be abnormally high. Furthermore, the width of the lakeshore zone was found to have a significant impact on water quality, with a critical width of 150 m having the greatest effect. Cropland and saline land explained almost 50% of the water quality variability throughout different seasons. The results also revealed that dual control of N and phosphorus (P) will be required to prevent eutrophication in the study area. Agricultural activities and severe soil salinization were identified as the main causes of diffuse pollution. The establishment of a width threshold identification framework for lakeshore zones is not only of great significance for development of scientific and acceptable restoration plans for lakeshore vegetation filters in ecologically vulnerable areas of western Jilin, but should also provide an effective and user-friendly tool for implementing diffuse pollution control.

J	Boulanger, J; Poole, KG; Gunn, A; Adamczewski, J; Wierzchowski, J				Boulanger, John; Poole, Kim G.; Gunn, Anne; Adamczewski, Jan; Wierzchowski, Jack			Estimation of trends in zone of influence of mine sites on barren-ground caribou populations in the Northwest Territories, Canada, using new methods	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY												The zone of influence (ZOI) is the area in the vicinity of industrial development where avoidance by caribou Rangifer tarandus or other wildlife species is observed. Here we examine ZOI around two diamond mines in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada from 1998 to 2017. In this paper, we further develop segmented/piecewise regression methods to analyze collar location and aerial survey data with a focus on yearly trend in ZOI for the Bathurst caribou herd. A base habitat model was initially formulated to account for habitat selection around mines followed by estimation of ZOI distance and magnitude. Seasonal ranges of the herd contracted from 2009 to 2017 due to decline in herd size, which influenced the distribution of caribou relative to the mines as well as larger scale habitat selection. Models with year-specific estimates of ZO1 were more supported than models assuming a constant ZO1 across years. Significant ZOI's occurred for aerial survey and/or collar data in 9 of 15 years from 2003 to 2017 when both mines were in full operation, with ZOI distances ranging from 6.1 to 18.7 km. Non-significant ZOI's occurred from 1998 to 2002 before both mines were fully operational. Caribou were attracted to lakes in drought years which significantly influenced distribution relative to mines as well as the magnitude of the ZOI detected. The ZOI extent averaged 7.2 km (CI = 3.8-10.5) when standardized for mean levels of drought. Our analysis suggests that ZOI varies both annually and spatially because of the location of mines relative to habitat selection and seasonal range size. Therefore, exacting analysis methods that account for these sources of variation arc required for robust ZOI estimates. Segmented regression methods have become available in the R statistical program that allow flexible ZOI estimation for implementation of the methods in this study for caribou or other wildlife species.

Samples were collected for analysis during the hot, dry season (HDS) and cool, dry, windy season (CDWS). The zooplankton identified were Tropodiaptomus cunningtoni (TC), Mesocyclops aequatorialis aequatorialis (MAA), Thermocyclops neglectus (TN), Bosmina longirostris (BL), Diaphanosoma spp. (DS), and Nauplii. These zooplankton groups belong to copepods, Cyclopidae, Cladocera, Ctenopod, and Rotifers. Chl-a exhibited a substantial seasonal variation, with the highest concentration observed in HDS and lowest in CDWS. Zooplankton such as T. cunningtoni, M. aeq. aequatorialis, T. neglectus, B. longirostris, Diaphanosoma spp, Nauplii, and Rotifer increased during the HDS. The water temperatures (WT), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and Chl-a positively correlated with all zooplankton densities. Sodium (Na+) and Potassium (K+) ions positively correlated with TC, MAA, DS, Nauplii, and Rotifers. Chloride ion (Cl-) positively correlated with DS, Rotifers, while Carbonate ion (CO3 (2-)) positively correlated with TC. Bicarbonate (HCO3 (-)) correlated positively with DS and Rotifers, while TDS correlated negatively with BL, Nauplii, and Rotifers. Nitrite affected zooplankton density negatively, while SRP had a positive effect. The study revealed that physical-chemical variables, some significant ions, and Chl-a are the most critical factors influencing the spatial and seasonal variation of zooplankton density in the lake. These findings demonstrate the interaction between physical-chemical variables, Chl-a, and zooplankton and highlight the significance of ecological understanding of the complex dynamics of the food web system in shallow tropical lakes such as Lake Malombe- under the changing climate.

Tracing sulfate recycling in the hypersaline Perola Lake (SE Spain): A combined isotopic and microbiological approach	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Sulfur (S) plays a significant role in saline environments, and sulfate (SO4 (2-)) is an important component of the biogeochemical S-cycle since it acts as the main electron acceptor in anoxic sediments. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the fate of S, its origin, and processes affecting sulfate outcome in the hypersaline Petrola Lake in the Castilla-La Mancha region (High Segura Basin, SE Spain). The lake is the terminal discharge zone of an endorheic basin with considerable anthropogenic pressures. Anthropogenic activities (mainly agricultural inputs and wastewater discharge), together with bedrock leaching of sulfate and sulfide-rich sediments, increase dissolved SO4 (2-)in surface and groundwater up to 123,000 mg/L. The source and fate of sulfate in this environment was investigated coupling hydrochemistry, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) microprofiles, isotopic analyses (delta S-34, delta(OSO4)-O-18, delta(2)delta H2O,delta(OH2O)-O-18, and tritium), mineralogical determinations, and molecular biology tools (S-16 rDNA amplification and sequencing). The origin of dissolved SO4 (2-)in water is related to pyrite oxidation from Lower Cretaceous sediments, and secondary gypsum dissolution. Under the lake, dissolved SO4 (2-)decreases with depth, controlled by three main processes: (1) seasonal evaporation cycles, (2) hydrodynamic instability caused by the different density-driven groundwater flow, and (3) sulfate-reduction processes, i. e. dissimilatory bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). These processes control the continuous recycling of sulfur in the system. Lake water and groundwater are in hydraulic connection, and a density-driven flow (DDF) is able to transport reactive organic matter and dissolved SO4 (2-) towards the underlying aquifer. Hydrochemical evolution in depth, H2S production (up to 0.024 nmol/cm(3).s) and the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria suggest the existence of BSR processes. However, isotope techniques are insufficient to elucidate BSR processes since their isotopic effect is masked by low isotope fractionation and high SO4 (2-)concentrations. The pattern here described may be found in other saline basins worldwide.					; Sanz, David/K-5017-2014; Soler Gil, Albert/K-3208-2014; Gómez Alday, Juan José/K-2876-2014; Gomez-Alday, Juan Jose/K-2876-2014; Valiente Parra, Nicolas/AAP-9551-2020; Valiente, Nicolas/AAP-9551-2020; Carrey, Raul/K-8882-2014; Otero, Neus/A-5473-2013; Soler-Gil, Albert/K-3208-2014	Carrey, Raul/0000-0002-0969-8818; Sanz, David/0000-0002-1629-2875; Soler Gil, Albert/0000-0003-3140-182X; Gomez-Alday, Juan Jose/0000-0003-1399-0421; Valiente Parra, Nicolas/0000-0002-2775-4203; Otero, Neus/0000-0001-6553-7958; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				NOV 30	2017	473						74	89		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.024													WOS:000414192600007

This UK project, involving several universities, the British Antarctic Survey and the National Oceanography Centre, had been in planning for 10 years. The project developed a full blueprint for subglacial lakes research, involving access to the subglacial environment through deep drilling, direct measurement and sampling of water and sediment by the construction of a probe and sediment corer, and environmental protocols to ensure cleanliness in line with international agreements on stewardship and protection of subglacial systems. Drilling was ceased after the main borehole failed to link with a subsurface cavity of water, built up over similar to 40 hours. Without this link, insufficient water was available to continue drilling downwards to the lake, similar to 3000 m beneath the surface. On return to the UK, an external review of the programme was undertaken to formally assess the reasons for the fieldwork failure, and to make recommendations on the modifications necessary for success. From this review, the Lake Ellsworth programme formulated a pathway along which a second attempt to explore the lake can be developed. Here details of the Lake Ellsworth field experiment, the circumstances that led to its failure and the corrections required are presented. Hot-water drilling is still regarded as the only feasible scheme for assuring clean access to the subglacial environment. The lessons learned from the Lake Ellsworth experience are substantial, however, and demonstrate that considerable technological and methodological advances are necessary for successful future research on subglacial lakes beneath thick (>2 km) ice.					; Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008; Makinson, Keith/A-2495-2013	Mowlem, Matthew/0000-0001-7613-6121; Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806; Makinson, Keith/0000-0002-5791-1767													0260-3055	1727-5644					2014	55	65					59	73		10.3189/2014AoG65A008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014AoG65A008													WOS:000341676800008

Yet, it remains unclear whether radiative or aerodynamic forces contribute more to water surface evaporation, which may lead to different strategies in model parameterization. This study compared the eddy covariance observations taken at two contrasting lakes in China: Poyang Lake (subtropical, plain, and warm) in 2018 and Yamzhog Yum Co (alpine, plateau, and cold) in 2016. Both lakes of similar latitude have similar solar radiation, and Yamzhog Yum Co has a lower atmospheric pressure and air density and a larger temperature difference between water surface and air. Poyang Lake had a total evaporation of 741 mm from 6 May to 31 December 2018, relatively higher than that of Yamzhog Yum Co (677 mm) for the same season in 2016. Evaporation peaked in August for Poyang Lake but in October for Yamzhog Yum Co. The Penman equation disclosed that radiative forces contributed more than aerodynamic forces in both lakes. Evaporation was found to be most sensitive to air temperature in Poyang Lake but to surface net radiation in Yamzhog Yum Co, attributable to their sensitivity differences in iso-radiative and isothermal conditions. Higher elevation reduced the aerodynamic contribution with lower air temperature and atmospheric pressure in Yamzhog Yum Co. The findings should be useful for understanding different behaviors of lake evaporation under common mechanisms.

Fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide by photoautotrophic algal cultures has the potential to diminish the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thereby helping to alleviate the trend toward global warming. This work investigates the role of algae in controlling the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCCs) technique is used to address how the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is affected by changes in a specific parameter disregarding the uncertainty over the rest of the model parameters. Parameters related to algal growth are shown to significantly reduce the level of atmospheric CO2. Further, we explore the dynamics of nonautonomous system by incorporating the seasonal variations of some ecologically important model parameters. Our nonautonomous system exhibits globally attractive positive periodic solution, and also the appearance of double periodic solution is observed. Moreover, by letting the seasonally forced parameters as almost periodic functions of time, we show almost periodic behavior of the system. Our findings suggest that the policy makers should focus on continuous addition of nutrients in the ocean to accelerate the algal growth thereby reducing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The heat exchange process between surface water and near-surface atmosphere in the front of the dam has also been changed due to the construction of the dam, which will affect the development of downstream ecosystems. Therefore, the discussion of the water body in the front of the dam is very important. This research focused on the changes in the near-surface air temperature (NSAT) before the TGD was constructed (1989-2003, Pre-TGD) and the variations in the NSAT and the surface water temperature in the front of the dam (DSWT) after the construction of the TGD (2004-2018, Post-TGD). By analyzing the relationship between the changes and correlations of the NSAT and the DSWT and the operation cycle of the dam, exploring the impact of the TGD on the heat exchange process between the water-air interface. The results show that (1) the warming rate of the NSAT in the Pre-TGD period was obviously higher than the warming rate of the NSAT in the Post-TGD period. (2) After the construction of the dam, the DSWT showed a considerable upward trend, which was much higher than the rate of increase of the NSAT during the same period. And the variation trend in the NSAT and DSWT showed obvious seasonal and artificial regulation characteristics. (3) The NSAT and the DSWT were significantly correlated during the flood season. The construction of the TGD has changed the heat exchange process in the front of the dam, and that will further affect the regional heat balance.

J	van den Hoff, J; Bell, E; Whittock, L				van den Hoff, John; Bell, Elanor; Whittock, Lucy			Dimorphism in the Antarctic cryptophyte Geminigera cryophila (Cryptophyceae)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												A pink to red-pigmented cryptophyte of undetermined taxonomic affinity was isolated and cloned from two seasonally ice-covered. meromictic, saline Antarctic aquatic environments: Bayly Bay (BB) and Ace Lake (AL). The clones shared a number of morphological and ultrastructural similarities with other cryptomonad genera, which confounded identification by light and electron microscopy. Cellular pigments extracted from the AL clone showed an absorption maximum corresponding to the biliprotein Cr-phycoerythrin 545, thus narrowing its potential taxonomic affinities. Partial 18S SSU ribosomal gene sequences were isolated from both the AL and the BB cryptomonads' nuclear rDNA, whereas PCR-amplified and their molecular phylogenies inferred from the subject sequences. Our results, and the results of another study that used our prepublished sequence data, invariably resolved both clones as very close matches with the Antarctic cryptophyte, Geminigera cryophila. When combined, the morphological, chemical, and molecular evidence suggested that both of our cryptophyte clones were a cryptomorph of the G. cryophila campylomorph. Slight differences between the AL and BB nuclear tree reconstructions suggested divergent microevolution following long-term isolation of the AL population from the surrounding marine ecosystem. This study provides further compelling evidence that certain Cryptophyceae engage in a life-history strategy, which includes alternating morphologically distinct cell-types (dimorphism); cell-types which without molecular analyses could be mistaken as novel taxa.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				AUG	2020	56	4					1028	1038		10.1111/jpy.13004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.13004		MAY 2020						32289881					WOS:000530452400001

Lakes dammed by cold-based glaciers, however, are less common and GLOFs from these glaciers have been rarely reported. Understanding both the origin and the failure mechanisms of lakes dammed by cold-based glaciers and subsequent flood processes is essential for territorial planning. We study a remarkable GLOF triggered by the failure of a subglacial lake in the Manflas Valley, Arid Andes of Chile, in 1985 providing insights into the lake's origin, clarifying the failure mechanism and modelling the GLOF event-related dynamics. To identify the factors that contributed to the lake formation and failure, we analysed remotely sensed images, meteorological and topographic data. The GLOF dynamics were reconstructed using empirical (LAHARZ and MSF) and physical models (RAMMS). The obtained results were compared with field data of flow extent, depth and velocity. We show that the failed lake (4x106m(3)) formed in a low-slope (10 degrees) area and that extreme (90th percentile) annual precipitation before the GLOF contributed to the lake filling and probably to the dam collapse. The lake likely drained rapidly after mechanical failure of the ice-dam producing a high energy sediment-laden flow. We show the challenges of modelling large flows over long distances (dozens of kilometres) especially when flows change between Newtonian and Non-Newtonian phases. A GLOF can still endanger the Manflas Valley since a remnant of the lake of about 220.000m(3) exists and economic assets are located along the1985 GLOF path.					; Schaefer, Marius/HNR-3586-2023; Norton, Kevin/F-1606-2011	Mackintosh, Andrew/0000-0002-6430-4711; Allen, Simon/0000-0002-4809-649X; Schaefer, Marius/0000-0002-7508-8786; Norton, Kevin/0000-0002-7995-6464													0921-030X	1573-0840				OCT	2018	94	1					93	119		10.1007/s11069-018-3376-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-018-3376-y													WOS:000445112300006

These lakes captured the drainage systems and were subjected to hot and arid climatic conditions in a low-latitude area. These conditions are evidenced by the Lower Cretaceous fluvio-lacustrine deposits that filled the Sousa Basin, which integrates a complex of basins along the Rio do Peixe (State of Paraiba). The Sousa Formation is the most representative unit in the Sousa Basin, being predominantly composed of siltstones and shales deposited in shallow lacustrine environments with fluvial influence. The sedimentation occurred under a semi-arid climate with alternating rainy and dry seasons, indicating the presence of ephemeral lakes. This is also supported by the lithology, the sedimentary structures (mud cracks) and the evaporites (gypsum). The lacustrine environment is favorable to the proliferation of non-marine ostracods, which are microcrustaceans of great importance for the study of current and paleolake deposits. Non-marine ostracod assemblages recovered from the Sousa Formation, sampled from core 2-FC-1-PB, revealed undescribed species. In this work, these ostracods were studied taxonomically, with the new species Cypridea paraibensis sp. nov., Cypridea vianai sp. nov. and Alicenula sousaensis sp. nov., as well as the already described Alicenula leguminella (Forbes, 1855) Martens, Rossetti and Horne 2003, Brasacypris ovum Krommelbein 1965, Cypridea ambigua Krommelbein 1962, and Reconcavona swami Krommelbein 1962 being identified. Another set of taxa remained in open nomenclature, since the morphological descriptions did not fit existing species. Thus, the descriptions referring to the described groups take into consideration criteria such as similarity and variability of morphological factors (Alicenula ex gr. legurninella and Alicenula sp. 1), degree of preservation, and quantity of recovered carapaces.					; Carvalho, Ismar/G-3603-2012	Sousa, Ariany/0000-0002-8847-6884; Carvalho, Ismar/0000-0002-1811-0588													0895-9811					OCT	2018	86						23	37		10.1016/j.jsames.2018.06.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2018.06.001													WOS:000444667900003

The purpose of the present research study is to identify the changes in land use and land cover in the Wular catchment as well as its transformation into other classes and its impact on the overall water quality of the lake. For the present study Landsat (TM) image of 1992 and Landsat-8 (OLI) of 2015 have been used for assessing the changes in land use/land cover. Supervised classification technique was used to generate LULC maps of different categories pertaining to study area for years 1992 and 2015. Regarding water quality, water samples were collected from five different spots of the lake in four different seasons of the yearfrom December 2014 to September 2015. The sites from which samples were collected are Vintage Park, Ashtungo, Watlab, Makhdomyari and Ningal as site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Some parameters of water like temperature, transparency, depth, conductivity and pH were examined on the spot during the sample collection by their respective measuring instruments. The rest of the parameters were examined in hydrological laboratory within 24h after collection following the standard methods of APHA (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 21st edn. American Public Health Association, Washington, DC, 2005). The relationship between the LULC classes and water quality parameters has been calculated with the help of SHDI which has shown both positive and as well as negative results.					; Sahana, Goutam/AAI-7579-2021	GANAIE, TARIQ AHMAD/0000-0002-1686-9769; Sahana, Mehebub/0000-0002-3166-5916; 													0343-2521	1572-9893				OCT	2018	83	5					1091	1113		10.1007/s10708-017-9822-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-017-9822-7													WOS:000444391600014

However, LDBs of submerged macrophytes often exhibit species differences and vary with seasonal water level fluctuations. In this study, we carried out a three-year field investigation to compare differences in the LDBs of three submerged macrophyte species (i.e., Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton maackianus) and explore their distinct determinants. We assumed that LDB differences would exist among the three species and that water level (WL) would be a key environmental driver of LDB dynamics, with an association between the LDBs of submerged macrophytes and water level fluctuations. Indeed, our results showed significant seasonal differences between C. demersum and V. natans in the period of September - May, with mean annual values in the order (low to high) V. natans, C. demersum, and P. maackianus. Furthermore, water level was a major driving force of the LDB dynamics of the three species. Changes in the LDBs of the three species in response to water level fluctuations could be divided into three periods: i.e., recovery growth period (April to June), stress tolerance period (July to September), and recession period (October to following March). This study not only clarifies the impact of water level on submerged macrophyte growth and distribution, but also has larger practical implications for the ecological restoration and management of large deep lakes.					; Wang, Hao/JBJ-1954-2023; Su, Haojie/JVO-6993-2024; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	Su, Haojie/0000-0003-4780-1094; Wen, Zihao/0000-0003-3885-5568; Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				JAN	2022	176								103451	10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.103451		SEP 2021											WOS:000706240700002
J	Tudesque, L; Pool, TK; Chevalier, M				Tudesque, Loic; Pool, Thomas K.; Chevalier, Mathieu			Planktonic diatom community dynamics in a tropical flood-pulse lake: the Tonle Sap (Cambodia)	DIATOM RESEARCH												It has been proposed that, within flood-pulse systems, seasonally dynamic conditions promote extremely high levels of biodiversity. In this paper, we aim to understand how variation in environmental conditions and habitat availability, across space and time, influences the structure and composition of plankton diatom communities within the Tonle-Sap Lake (Cambodia) during two flood-pulse cycles. We hypothesize that (i) communities vary considerably across space and time, (ii) environmental filtering accounts for a substantial portion of the variation in community composition, and (iii) shifts in meta-community structure occur seasonally, due to variation in both environmental conditions and habitat availability. A principal component analysis and a permutational multivariate analysis of variance were used to characterize spatio-temporal variations in environmental conditions, community structure and composition. Determinants of community variations across space were identified by redundancy analyses and variation partitioning, while seasonal changes in meta-community structure were assessed by investigating temporal changes in beta-diversity. Our results indicate that (i) spatial variations in community structure and composition are largely influenced by the seasonal flood-pulse, (ii) environmental filtering is the most likely process driving the compositional changes, and (iii) changes in diatom life-form community provide insights into the hydrological functioning of the Tonle Sap. We conclude that the survey of diatom communities may constitute a relevant sensor of hydrological change in the system and could be used to derive regionally specific hypotheses about how global climate change is impacting the lake's functioning.					; chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020; Tudesque, Loic/GVX-0456-2022	Chevalier, Mathieu/0000-0002-1170-5343; 													0269-249X	2159-8347					2019	34	1					1	22		10.1080/0269249X.2019.1585960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2019.1585960		MAR 2019											WOS:000465675800001

We studied the seasonality and stability of bla(CTX-M) in Lake Maggiore over 3 years and the role of potential inputs of allochthonous bacteria and/or antibiotic pollution in promoting its occurrence. bla(CTX-M) was mainly present from January to July in the pelagic microbial community and the gene occurrence was significantly related to low water temperature. To evaluate its temporal stability in the bacterial community over a short period, we measured bla(CTX-M) daily over the course of 6 days. The gene was below the limit of quantification except for one sampling when its abundance peaked, suggesting a point contamination. The bacterial community of the lake in which bla(CTX-M) was detected suggests that at least two distinct bacterial populations contained the gene. The occurrence of known bla(CTX-M) containing genera and the occurrence of the gene, however, did not overlap. Furthermore, the experimental addition of cefotaxime to lake water incubations did not promote abundance of the gene. These data imply that bla(CTX-M) was present in the environmental microbial community. Increases of gene abundances were likely caused by environmental parameters other than antibiotic contamination.

J	Linderholm, HW; Gunnarson, BE				Linderholm, Hans W.; Gunnarson, Bjorn E.			Were medieval warm-season temperatures in Jamtland, central Scandinavian Mountains, lower than previously estimated?	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA					10th World Dendro Commemorative Conference	JUN 02-22, 2018	Thimphu, BHUTAN					Today few high-quality tree-ring based temperature reconstructions extending over the past millennium exist, and those have, in general, low replication in their early parts. Here we present a new and updated maximum latewood density (MXD) chronology extending over the last 1200 years, built from local Scots pine wood sources (living trees, drywood preserved the ground, and subfossil wood extracted from lakes) all collected within 20 km in the Scandinavian Mountains in Jamtland. The MXD data was used to reconstruct April-September mean temperatures, where 60% of the variance in observed temperatures could be explained. The reconstruction exhibited distinct multidecadal variability, with the coldest periods centred on ca. 900, 1450, 1600 and 1900 CE, and the warmest periods on ca. 1160, 1250, 1500, 1660 CE. The last part of the 20th - early part of 21st century was the warmest period throughout the whole record, and the reconstruction suggests that, on average, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950-1250 CE) was only slightly warmer than the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1450-1900 CE). In fact, compared to earlier reconstructions from the region, the new reconstruction suggested lower MCA warm-season temperatures. However, despite sufficient replication during that period, high inhomogeneity among the MXD series makes this period slightly uncertain. The unique drywood on which the chronology was built, displayed a distinct regeneration pattern, where changes in Scots pine establishment was interpreted as responses to changes in forest fire activity and climate throughout the past millennium.

Using a Bayesian change point analysis and modified Mann-Kendall tests, time series of annual mean, maximum, minimum, and seasonal precipitation and flow, as well as annual mean lake volumes, were analysed for the period 1960-2010 to uncover possible abrupt shifts and gradual trends. Double cumulative curve analysis was used to investigate the changes in hydrological response attributable to either human influence or climatic variability. The results indicate a significant decline in lake volumes at a mean rate of 9.35x10(6)m(3)year(-1). Most of the river gauging stations showed no evidence of trends in the annual mean and maximum flows as well as seasonal flows. Annual minimum flows, however, showed abrupt shifts and significant (upward/downward) trends at the main outlet stations. Precipitation in the basin showed no evidence of abrupt shifts, but a few stations showed gradual decline. The observed changes in precipitation could not explain the decline in both minimum flows and lake volumes. The findings show no evidence of any impact of climate change for the Lake Naivasha basin over the past 50years. This implies that other factors, such as changes in land cover and infrastructure development, have been responsible for the observed changes in streamflow and lake volumes.

Large intra-tooth variations in the oxygen isotopic composition (up to 9%) were observed in the enamel of herbivores from the Neanderthal fossil site of Payre, consistent with preservation of seasonal cyclicity. The range of isotopic compositions observed in Neanderthal tooth enamel was much smaller (similar to 3%), possibly the result of a longer enamel maturation time averaging out variability. An archaeological otolith from a Preceramic site in Northern Peru exhibited marked changes in delta O-18 over life, due either to the fish occasionally migrating from the sea to a lower salinity habitat, or to short-lived rises in sea water temperature. A fish otolith from Australia's Willandra Lakes World Heritage Area showed clear seasonal variations, but also a general trend towards isotopically heavier and more saline water, as indicated by higher delta O-18 and Sr/Ca values resulting from increased evaporation. The results of these case studies are compared to results of oxygen isotope analysis using more conventional methods and demonstrate the ability of the SHRIMP II to provide precise high spatial resolution in-situ oxygen isotope analyses of a variety of biogenic materials. This approach has major advantages over conventional methods. It can provide rapid, micro-scale isotopic analyses of sub-permil precision without the need for chemical preparation of the sample.

Sea ice begins to form in late October, and the Bay is usually ice-free in early August. This seasonally varying ice cover plays an important role in the regional climate. To identify secular trends in the cryogenic cycle, we examined variability in the timing of sea-ice formation and retreat during the period 1971-2003. The dates of ice freeze-up and breakup at 36 locations across Hudson Bay were catalogued for each year from weekly ice charts provided by the Canadian Ice Service. We used the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test to determine the statistical significance of the trends and the Theil-Sen approach to estimate their magnitude. Our results indicate statistically significant trends toward earlier breakup in James Bay, along the southern shore of Hudson Bay, and in the western half of Hudson Bay, and toward later freeze-up in the northern and northeastern regions of Hudson Bay. These trends in the annual ice cycle of Hudson Bay coincide with both the regional temperature record and the projections from general circulation models. If this trend toward a longer ice-free season continues, Hudson Bay will soon face important environmental challenges.

The SRB drains much of Southern Malawi and receives the sole outflow of Lake Malawi whose catchment extends over much of Central and Northern Malawi (and Tanzania and Mozambique). Stable isotope (283) and hydrochemical (150) samples were collected in 2017-2018 and analysed at Malawi's recently commissioned National Isotopes Laboratory. Distinct surface water dry-season isotope enrichment and wet-season depletion are shown with minor retention of enriched signatures ascribed to Lake Malawi influences. Isotopic signatures corroborate that wet-season river flows mostly arise from local precipitation, with dry-season flows supported by increased groundwater contributions. Groundwater signatures follow a local meteoric water line of limited spread suggesting recharge by local precipitation predominantly during the peak months of the wet-season. Relatively few dry-season groundwater samples displayed evaporative enrichment, although isotopic seasonality was more pronounced in the lowlands compared to uplands ascribed to amplified climatic effects. These signatures serve as isotopic diagnostic tools that valuably informed a basin conceptual model build and, going forward, may inform key identified Malawian IWRM concerns. The isotopic baseline establishes a benchmark against which future influences from land use, climate change and water mixing often inherent to IWRM schemes may be forensically assessed. It thereby enables both source-water protection and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6.

To examine the influence of rainfall on epilithic diatom communities, we measured the diatom distribution and river water quality at 29 sites along the main-stream and tributaries of the Hantangang River, Korea, in the period of 2012-2015. Water quality parameters in the polluted sites had improved following rainfall, but the response of dominant species varied with water quality; the dominant species Nitzschia fonticola decreased in abundance regardless of sampling sites, and the abundance of Achnanthidium minutissimum in the clean sites and Nitzschia palea in the polluted sites increased after rainfall, respectively. The community dynamic index (CDI) showed that the most obvious shift of epilithic diatom community occurred in the mid-polluted sites in 2013 with the highest rainfall. This suggest that the effect of rainfalls on the epilithic diatom community is dependent on various parameters, such as the magnitude of rainfall, water quality and its biotic compositions of diatom communities, but it also indicates that improving the water quality of rivers is important to promote the resilience of diatom communities to extremes of precipitation.

J	Boit, A; Gaedke, U				Boit, Alice; Gaedke, Ursula			Benchmarking Successional Progress in a Quantitative Food Web	PLOS ONE												Central to ecology and ecosystem management, succession theory aims to mechanistically explain and predict the assembly and development of ecological communities. Yet processes at lower hierarchical levels, e. g. at the species and functional group level, are rarely mechanistically linked to the under-investigated system-level processes which drive changes in ecosystem properties and functioning and are comparable across ecosystems. As a model system for secondary succession, seasonal plankton succession during the growing season is readily observable and largely driven autogenically. We used a long-term dataset from large, deep Lake Constance comprising biomasses, auto-and heterotrophic production, food quality, functional diversity, and mass-balanced food webs of the energy and nutrient flows between functional guilds of plankton and partly fish. Extracting population-and system-level indices from this dataset, we tested current hypotheses about the directionality of successional progress which are rooted in ecosystem theory, the metabolic theory of ecology, quantitative food web theory, thermodynamics, and information theory. Our results indicate that successional progress in Lake Constance is quantifiable, passing through predictable stages. Mean body mass, functional diversity, predator-prey weight ratios, trophic positions, system residence times of carbon and nutrients, and the complexity of the energy flow patterns increased during succession. In contrast, both the mass-specific metabolic activity and the system export decreased, while the succession rate exhibited a bimodal pattern. The weighted connectance introduced here represents a suitable index for assessing the evenness and interconnectedness of energy flows during succession. Diverging from earlier predictions, ascendency and eco-exergy did not increase during succession. Linking aspects of functional diversity to metabolic theory and food web complexity, we reconcile previously disjoint bodies of ecological theory to form a complete picture of successional progress within a pelagic food web. This comprehensive synthesis may be used as a benchmark for quantifying successional progress in other ecosystems.																			1932-6203					FEB 27	2014	9	2							e90404	10.1371/journal.pone.0090404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090404								24587353					WOS:000332390800105

We investigated the composition, distribution of P fractions in sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) of Erhai Lake, southwest China, and explored the relationships between environmental variables and spatial-temporal variations of P fractions. The total P (TP) in surface sediments ranged from 817 to 1216 mg/kg, with inert Ca-P (32%) and Res-P (24%) predominating, at a moderate level. The comparison of short-term release fluxes (0.08 mg/(m2<middle dot>d)) and long-term release fluxes (0.09 mg/(m2<middle dot>d)) reflected that the northern region was recovering slowly from the previous P pollution. Mobile-P (the sum of loosely adsorbed P, iron bound P, and organic P) accounted for 52.3% of the TP in SPM and showed high spatial-temporal variations, which were closely related to the growth of algae throughout the investigation. The results suggested that sediments could make a sustained contribution to IPL, and that the P in SPM was highly active and significantly contributed to eutrophication in Erhai Lake especially at the time of seasonal alternations. Our data provided important theoretical bases for the relationship between internal phosphorus loading and eutrophication in plateau lakes.

To examine the water use strategies of plants in desert lake basin areas, water uptake patterns, water use efficiency, and water potential of Nitraria tangutorum were investigated at different distances from the lake duringhe growing seasons in the lake basin regions of the Badain Jaran Desert. The results indicate that N. tangutorum primarily absorbed groundwater in May (63.8%) and August (53.5%), relied on deep soil water in June (75.1%), and uniformly absorbed soil water from different layers in July. These observations could be explained by periodic fluctuations in the groundwater level and the consequent decrease in soil water availability, as well as plant root adjustments. As soil water availability decreases, N. tangutorum adapts to water variation by increasing its water use efficiency (WUE) and reducing its leaf water potential (?). With intensified water stress, N. tangutorum gradually shifted from adventurous anisohydric regulation to conservative isohydric regulation. Thus, N. tangutorum responds to diverse degrees of environmental changes by altering its water-use strategy. A better understanding of the adaptive water use strategies developed by desert plants under varying water availability conditions provides insight into the diversity of species' reactions to long-term drought and quantifies the hydrological cycle of desert ecosystems against the background of worldwide climate warming.

Benthic-pelagic coupling in lake ecosystems: the key role of chironomid pupae as prey of pelagic fish	ECOSPHERE												Studies of lake ecosystems have often treated benthic and pelagic habitats as discrete food chains with parallel, separated compartments. A limited number of studies on the importance of fish feeding for benthic-pelagic coupling have been conducted with a food-web perspective of lakes. We hypothesize that pelagic fish couple benthic and pelagic food webs by feeding on chironomid pupae ascending from the sediment to the surface. Over a two-year period, an analysis of the stomach contents of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) was combined with simultaneous catches of chironomids in near-bottom pupal traps and floating emergence traps exposed in the littoral and profundal region of a deep temperate reservoir. Chironomid larvae rarely served as prey for perch. While chironomid pupae from the littoral region were of minor importance as perch prey, we determined a substantial vertical trophic biomass transfer from the profundal to the pelagic food web for the pupation peak of profundal chironomids from May through June. During this period, chironomid pupae represented approximately 20-48% of the ingested biomass of all size classes of perch (70-340 mm). The pupae of only three large profundal species out of 84 chironomid taxa detected in the reservoir represented approximately 80% of the chironomids consumed by perch, indicating a key role for these taxa in benthic-pelagic coupling. The strong influences of species, habitat and size on the consumption of chironomid pupae by the pelagic perch provide the importance of detecting key benthic species that substantially contribute to the pelagic food web. The phenology of profundal species results in a seasonal shift in the feeding behavior of pelagic fish, which thereby influences the trophic dynamics of lake ecosystems. Therefore, we argue for a more integrated view of lake ecosystems that recognizes not only the littoral but also the complementarity of profundal and pelagic production pathways crucial for ecosystem functioning.

J	Turner, R; Roberts, N; Eastwood, WJ; Jenkins, E; Rosen, A				Turner, Rebecca; Roberts, Neil; Eastwood, Warren J.; Jenkins, Emma; Rosen, Arlene			Fire, climate and the origins of agriculture: micro-charcoal records of biomass burning during the last glacial-interglacial transition in Southwest Asia	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												This study investigates changes in climate, vegetation, wildfire and human activity in Southwest Asia during the transition to Neolithic agriculture between ca. 16 and ca. 9 ka. In order to trace the fire history of this region, we use microscopic charcoal from lake sediment sequences, and present two new records: one from south central Turkey (Akgol) and the other from the southern Levant (Hula). These are interpreted primarily as the result of regional-scale fire events, with the exception of a single large event ca. 13 ka at Akgol, which phytolith analysis shows was the result of burning of the local marsh vegetation. Comparison between these and other regional micro-charcoal, stable isotope and pollen records shows that wildfires were least frequent when the climate was cold and dry (glacial, Lateglacial Stadial) and the vegetation dominated by chenopod-Artemisia steppe, and that they became more frequent and/or bigger at times of warmer, wetter but seasonally dry climate (Lateglacial Interstadial, early Holocene). Warmer and wetter climates caused an increase in biomass availability, with woody matter appearing to provide the main fuel source in sites from the Levant, while grass fires predominated in the interior uplands of Anatolia. Southwest Asia's grasslands reached their greatest extent during the early Holocene, and they were maintained by dry-season burning that helped to delay the spread of woodland by up to 3 ka, at the same time as Neolithic settlement became established across this grass parkland landscape. Although climatic changes appear to have acted as the principal 'pacemaker' for fire activity through the last glacial interglacial climatic transition (LGIT), human actions may have amplified shifts in biomass burning. Fire regimes therefore changed markedly during this time period, and both influenced, and were influenced by, the cultural-economic transition from hunter-foraging to agriculture and village life.

The last glacial termination in northwestern Patagonia viewed from the Lago Fonk (∼40°S) record	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The anatomy of the Last Glacial Termination (T1) in the southern mid-latitudes, and its relationship with changes in the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW), offers empirical constraints for understanding the mechanisms involved in the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum into the current interglacial. Northwestern Patagonia (40 degrees-44 degrees S) is a sensitive region for monitoring past changes in the SWW, the Patagonian Ice Sheet, terrestrial ecosystems, and fire regimes through T1. Here we present results from Lago Fonk (similar to 40 degrees S) to examine the structure of T1 based on the palynological, macroscopic charcoal, elemental, and isotopic composition of organic lake sediments. We observe an instantaneous establishment of Nothofagus-dominated forests at the onset of T1, followed by a diversification and densification trend that culminated with the establishment of thermophilous, Myrtaceae-dominated North Patagonian rainforests between similar to 15.6-14.7 cal ka BP. The expansion of the conifer Podocarpus nubigena marks a shift to cool-temperate and hyperhumid conditions, coeval with high lake levels and enhanced algal productivity between similar to 14.7-11.9 cal ka BP. Standreplacing fires, driven by enhanced seasonality or high-frequency rainfall variability, started at similar to 12.4 cal ka BP and catalyzed the rapid spread of Weinmannia trichosperma. Subsequent warming and a decline in precipitation at similar to 11.4 cal ka BP led to intense fire activity, lake-level lowering, and establishment of the Valdivian rainforest trees Eucryphia/Caldcluvia. Our results suggest a coherent linkage between changes documented in the amphi south Pacific region and Antarctic ice cores during T1. This implies a zonal and hemispheric response to changes in the position/intensity of the SWW that emphasizes their central role as a key driver of the hemispheric and global climate evolution through T1.

J	Butterwick, C; Heaney, SI; Talling, JF				Butterwick, C; Heaney, SI; Talling, JF			Diversity in the influence of temperature on the growth rates of freshwater algae, and its ecological relevance	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Growth rates of seven species of planktonic algae were determined in culture over a range of temperature from 2 to 35 degreesC. Additional observations on growth and viability were made for 13 species in the temperature range 20-35 degreesC. 2. There was a wide range of growth rates between species at their optimal temperatures, from 1.7 divisions day(-1) (Asterionella formosa) to 0.3 divisions day(-1) (Ceratium furcoides). 3. There were considerable differences between species for growth at low and high temperature. Certain algae, including the diatom A. formosa and the flagellates Cryptomonas marssonii, Dinobryon divergens and Eudorina unicocca var. unicocca, had growth rates of 0.4 divisions day(-1) or more at 5degreesC. The cyanophyte Tychonema (formerly Oscillatoria) bourrellyi, the xanthophyte Tribonema sp., the desmid Staurastrum cingulum and the large dinoflagellate C. furcoides grew poorly or not at all at this temperature. All 21 species tested could grow at 25degreesC, but many - including most of the diatoms, some cyanophytes, and all the flagellates - failed to grow persistently at 30degreesC. Only Aphanizomenon flos-aquae survived with moderate increase at 35degreesC, a lethal temperature for the other species. 4. The applicability was considered of proposed quantitative formulations of the rate-temperature relationship. Simple exponential relationships applied only to very limited lower ranges of temperature. The relationship proposed by Belehradek was a better fit over a wider temperature range, but still excluded rate-decline at high temperature. 5. The interspecific differences found are of potential significance for restrictions in natural distributions associated with season, altitude (especially above 500 m) and latitude.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2005	50	2					291	300																WOS:000226930700007

Historical changes in fish landings indicate a significant shift in fish catch composition and biodiversity loss in the Nile-Delta lakes	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												To monitor the changes in fish biodiversity and to elucidate the factors responsible for these changes, the landings composition (LC) over the past 30 years in the Nile-Delta lakes was quantitatively analyzed. The LC data indicates a shift in target species towards demersal opportunistic species. A significant difference (P < 0.001) between two main intervals highlighted in both PERMANOVA and PCA plot; the first interval (1991-2002) is dominated by Tilapia and rare species, while the second interval (2003-2020) is dominated by the opportunistic catfish and mullet species. Noticeable declines in species richness and landings of rare species were observed, where rare taxa either have been overexploited or they may be positively affected by increasing pollution levels than do other dominated species such as Tilapia. In contrast, opportunistic fish species such as catfish and mullet, have flourished in such polluted water due to their ability to tolerate seasonal pollution-related hypoxia.					; Abdel-Raheem, Khalaf/AAE-6472-2022; Ahmed, Mohamed/GQP-1116-2022; Abdelhady, Ahmed/H-2144-2013	Khalil, Mahmoud M./0000-0003-4002-4384; Ahmed, Mohamed/0000-0001-9249-6231; Samy-Kamal, Mohamed/0000-0003-3946-3697; Abdelhady, Ahmed/0000-0003-4438-8572													0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP	2023	194		B						115368	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115368		AUG 2023						37572433					WOS:001072294500001

For H. unitaeniatus and H. malabaricus, 11 parasite species were similar, and greatest parasite richness occurred during the rainy season. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was the dominant parasite species for both hosts. In H. unitaeniatus, infection by Whittingtonocotyle caetei, Whittingtonocotyle jeju, Urocleidoides sp. and Anacanthorus sp. was higher during rainy season. Contracaecum sp., Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, Nomimoscolex matogrossensis and Gorytocephalus spectabilis showed no seasonal pattern. For H. unitaeniatus, P. pillulare, Clinostomum marginatum and Argulus pestifer occurred only during dry season, while Trichodina sp., Dolops geayi, undetermined metacercariae and Posthodiplostomum sp. occurred only during the rainy season. In H. malabaricus, the prevalence of Urocleidoides eremitus was similar during the two seasons, but abundance was higher during the rainy season. Tetrahymena sp., C. marginatum, Dendrorchis neivai, undetermined metacercariae, Posthodiplostomum sp., Genarchella genarchella, Cystidicoloides sp., G. spectabilis, D. geayi, A. pestifer and Glossiphonidae gen. sp. occurred only during the dry season. However, Contracaecum sp. and P. (S.) inopinatus occurred during both seasons, but the prevalence of P. (S.) inopinatus was higher during the rainy season. Seasonal variation in this infection levels was due to the host's feeding behavior and habits and the availability of infectious forms of parasites with heteroxenic life cycles. The non-seasonal fluctuation detected are likely a result of the parasites biology, highly variable nature of this tributary of Amazon River and low abundance of parasites.

In this paper, long-term country-wide rainfall over the period 1901-2011 was used to assess variability in the seasonal and annual rainfall volumes in all the River Nile countries in Africa. Temporal variability was determined through temporal aggregation of series rescaled nonparametrically in terms of the difference between the exceedance and non-exceedance counts of data points such that the long-term average (taken as the reference) was zero. The co-occurrence of the variability of rainfall with those of the large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions was analyzed. Between 2000 and 2012, while the rainfall in the equatorial region was increasing, that for the countries in the northern part of the River Nile was below the reference. Generally, the variability in the rainfall of the countries in the equatorial (northern) part of the River Nile was found to be significantly linked to occurrences in the Indian and Atlantic (Pacific and Atlantic) Oceans. Significant linkages to Nino 4 regarding the variability of both the seasonal and annual rainfall of some countries were also evident.

Over 20 years of data allow for investigating interannual variations beyond linear trends and seasonal signals. However, the origin of observed TWS changes cannot be determined solely with GRACE and GRACE-FO observations. This study focuses on the northern part of the East African Rift around the lakes of Turkana, Victoria, and Tanganyika. It aims to characterise and analyse the interannual TWS variations compared to meteorological and geodetic observations of the water storage compartments (surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater).We apply the STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) method to decompose the signal into a seasonal signal, an interannual signal, and residuals. By clustering the interannual TWS dynamics for the African continent, we define the exact outline of the study region.We observe a TWS decrease until 2006, followed by a steady rise until 2016, and then the most significant TWS gain in Africa in 2019 and 2020. Besides meteorological variability, surface water storage variations in the lakes explain large parts of the TWS decrease before 2006. The storage dynamics of Lake Victoria alone contribute up to 50 % of these TWS changes. On the other hand, the significant TWS increase around 2020 can be attributed to nearly equal rises in groundwater and surface water storage, which coincide with a substantial precipitation surplus. Soil moisture explains most of the seasonal variability but does not influence the interannual variations.As Lake Victoria dominates the surface water storage variations in the region, we further investigate the lake and the downstream Nile River. The Nalubaale Dam regulates Lake Victoria's outflow. Water level observations from satellite altimetry reveal the impact of dam operations on downstream discharge and on TWS decreases in the drought years before 2006. On the other hand, we do not find evidence for an impact of the Nalubaale Dam regulations on the strong TWS increase after 2019.

The concentration of the total phthalate ester congeners in source water ranged from 1.07g/L to 7.12g/L in the wet season, from 0.01g/L to 1.58g/L in the dry season, from 1.18g/L to 15.28g/L from drinking water in the wet season, and from 0.16g/L to 1.86g/L from drinking water in the dry season. Of the 16 phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, di-(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate, di-iso-butyl phthalate, bis-2-n-butoxyethyl phthalate, and dicyclohexyl phthalate were present in the samples analyzed, dominated by di-iso-butyl phthalate and di-(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate.

Sub-Severe and Severe Hail	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The occurrence and properties of hail smaller than severe thresholds (diameter < 25 mm) are poorly understood. Prior climatological hail studies have predominantly focused on large or severe hail (diameter at least 25 mm or 1 in.). Through use of data from the Meteorological Phenomena Identification Near the Ground project, Storm Data, and the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network the occurrence and characteristics of both severe and sub-severe hail are explored. Spatial distributions of days with the different classes of hail are developed on an annual and seasonal basis for the period 2013-20. Annually, there are several hail-day maxima that do not follow the maxima of severe hail: the peak is broadly centered over Oklahoma (about 28 days yr(-1)). A secondary maximum exists over the Colorado Front Range (about 26 days yr(-1)), a third extends across northern Indiana from the southern tip of Lake Michigan (about 24 days yr(-1) with hail), and a fourth area is centered over the corners of southwest North Carolina, northwest South Carolina, and the northeast tip of Georgia. Each of these maxima in hail days are driven by sub-severe hail. While similar patterns of severe hail have been previously documented, this is the first clear documentation of sub-severe hail patterns since the early 1990s. Analysis of the hail size distribution suggests that to capture the overall hail risk, each of the datasets provide a complimentary data source.

However, studies of comprehensive effects of land-use conversion on energy and hydrological cycling are still rare. In this study, we used 5 years (2014-2018) of eddy covariance (EC) data, modelled estimates, and hydrological monitoring of different functional layers (canopy, litter and soil layers) to summarize the seasonal and inter-annual variations and differences of evapotranspiration and water balance components in tea plantations (Camellia sinensis) and natural bamboo forests (Phyllostachysedulis). Results suggested the bamboo forest had higher actual evapotranspiration (ETa) (835 +/- 5 mm) than the tea plantation (730 +/- 19 mm), owing to differences in canopy conditions and plant physiology. Evident differences in ETa components were found between the tea plantation site and the bamboo forest site. The proportion of transpiration (E-tr) was higher at the bamboo site (0.71-0.76) than the tea plantation site (0.60-0.65). Additionally, the soil evaporation ratio (0.10-0.13) was lower at the bamboo forest site than the tea plantation site (0.21-0.24) due to vegetation structure differences altering the radiation energy partitioning between the two sites. Moreover, the tea plantations were more susceptible to drought stress with low water storage in soil and simple rhizome-root system. The comprehensive water holding capacity of canopy, litter, and soil layers of bamboo forest was 1.0-1.8 times of that in tea plantation. Compared with bamboo forest, pruning and losing of soil with intensive management activities enhanced drainage at the tea plantation site. This study provides insights into land-use conversion of subtropical forest and managed tea plantation that have important implications on regional energy and water budgets.					; Shi, Yunjie/GRX-9930-2022; ZHANG, WANGSHOU/AAO-2534-2021	Geng, jianwei/0000-0002-2235-1237; Shi, Yunjie/0000-0002-6625-8958; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				AUG	2022	36	8							e14652	10.1002/hyp.14652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14652													WOS:000849925200004

Heterotrophic and mixotrophic nanoflagellates in a mesotrophic lake: Abundance and grazing impacts across season and depth	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Nanoflagellates are recognized as fundamental members of the planktonic microbial food web due to their contribution to photosynthetic fixation of carbon and phagotrophic ingestion of bacteria. Although the presence, and often dominance, of mixotrophic nutrition among phytoflagellates has been well documented within a variety of aquatic ecosystems and in a range of taxa, few studies have assessed the abundance and grazing impact of mixotrophs in comparison to their photosynthetic and heterotrophic counterparts across seasons at multiple depths. Abundance and, as appropriate, bacterivory of phototrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic nanoflagellates were quantified at three depths over a 15-month period in Lake Lacawac (Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.) via microscopic analysis of ingested bacterial surrogates. The absolute and relative abundances of all nanoflagellate trophic groups varied with season and depth, likely as a result of differences in physiological tolerance. Whereas the abundance of phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoflagellates varied with depth in both the presence and absence of thermal stratification, mixotrophic protists were evenly distributed throughout the water column during mixis. The abundances of phototrophic and mixotrophic protists were significantly correlated, but only in surface waters during periods of thermal stratification. Grazing rate and consequent impact by bacterivorous nanoflagellates varied with depth across season, particularly during thermal stratification. Mixotrophic bacterivory exceeded that of heterotrophs in the epi- and metalimnion during stratification, removing an estimated maximum of 80% of the bacterial standing stock d(-1). The relative contribution of heterotrophic nanoflagellates to community bacterivory increased with depth, even during mixis, and dominated the grazing impact in the hypolimnion.

Nutrient limitation of periphyton growth in arctic lakes in south-west Greenland	POLAR BIOLOGY												Many arctic lakes are oligotrophic systems where phototrophic growth is controlled by nutrient supply. Recent anthropogenic nutrient loading is associated with biological and/or physico-chemical change in several lakes across the arctic. Shifts in nutrient limitation (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), or N + P) and associated effects on the growth and composition of algal communities are commonly reported. The Kangerlussuaq region of south-west Greenland forms a major lake district which is considered to receive little direct anthropogenic disturbance. However, long-range transport of pollutant N is now reaching Greenland, and it was hypothesised that a precipitation gradient from the inland ice sheet margin to the coast might also deliver increased N deposition. In situ nutrient bioassays were deployed in three lakes across the region: ice sheet margin, inland (close to Kangerlussuaq) and the coast (near Sisimiut), to determine nutrient limitation of lakes and investigate any effects of nutrients on periphyton growth and community composition. Nutrient limitation differed amongst lakes: N limitation (ice sheet margin), N and P limitation (inland) and N + P co-limitation (coast). Factors including variation in N supply, ice phenology, seasonal algal succession, community structure and physical limnology are explored as mechanisms to explain differences amongst lakes. Nutrient limitation of arctic lakes and associated ecological impacts are highly variable, even across small geographic areas. In this highly sensitive region, future environmental change scenarios carry a strong risk of significantly altering nutrient limitation; in turn, potentially severely impacting lake structure and function.

Lightning-caused forest fire risk in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, is increasing and associated with anomalies in fire weather	ENVIRONMETRICS												Results from studies of climate model scenarios suggest that forest fire ignitions will increase in Canada in the future because of climate change. Yet, there have been few studies that monitor long-term trends in Canadian historical fire records. Although there are seasonal trends to historically reported fires within a fire season, there are also periods of zero-heavy behaviour as well as periods during which more fires are reported than usual. We develop a flexible mixture-modelling framework that permits the joint assessment of temporal trends in these dominant characteristics in terms of fire risk, defined as the daily probability that one or more fires are reported. The statistical power of such trend tests are also evaluated. We identify statistically significant increases in lightning-caused fire risk between 1963 and 2009 in the boreal forest regions of the Rainy River and Lake of the Woods ecoregions in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. These observed changes in lightning-caused fire risk were found to be associated with temperature and fire danger rating index anomalies. If such trends continue into the future, the duration of elevated periods of lightning-caused forest fire risk is forecasted to increase by over 50% by the middle of this century.

New evidence for hominin carcass processing strategies at 1.5 Ma, Koobi Fora, Kenya	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												Reconstruction of early Pleistocene hominin carcass acquisition and processing behaviors are necessarily based at least in part on butchered fossil bones. This paper provides zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses and behavioral interpretations of three similar to 1.5 million-year-old archaeofaunas from areas 1A and 103 in the Okote Member of the Koobi Fora Formation, northern Kenya: FwJj14A, FwJj14B, and GaJi14. These sites are all located in similar paleoenvironmental contexts, near shallow water with swampy, seasonally flooded areas, and some evidence for more wooded or gallery forest settings. Both individual specimen- and assemblage-level analyses of butchery-marked bones indicate that the hominins appear to have practiced similar butchery strategies at all of these sites, with butchery (defleshing, disarticulation, and marrow extraction) of both high- and low-ranked skeletal elements with no apparent preference for prey size, skeletal region, limb class, or limb portion. Only four tooth-marked specimens, including one likely crocodile-tooth-marked bone, are preserved in all three archaeofaunas. A paucity of limb epiphyses suggests that bone-crunching hyenids may have deleted these portions subsequent to hominin butchery. Strangely, there are no stone tools preserved with the 292 cut-marked and 27 percussion-marked faunal specimens (out of a total of 6,039 specimens), suggesting that raw material availability may have conditioned hominin lithic discard patterns at these locales. These assemblages increase our knowledge of the dietary behavior and ecology of Homo erectus, and provide support for variability in early Pleistocene hominin carcass foraging patterns.

Carbon dioxide emissions and sediment organic carbon burials across a gradient of trophic state in eleven New Zealand lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes are known to be important to the global carbon balance as they are both CO2 sources to the atmosphere and also accumulate large amounts of carbon in their sediment. CO2 flux dynamics across the air-water interface in 11 lakes of varying trophic state in the Rotorua region, New Zealand, derived from measured alkalinity, pH and wind speed at given temperature, showed that lakes may shift from being atmospheric CO2 sources to sinks due to seasonal changes in phytoplankton productivity and lake mixing dynamics. Decreases in trophic state (i.e. improved water quality) in some of the lakes over the eight-year monitoring period were associated with increased surface water CO2 concentrations and, as a consequence, increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere. Organic carbon content analysis of the bottom sediments revealed that lakes with high phytoplankton productivity, indicated by high chlorophyll a biomass, generally had high rates of carbon deposition to the sediments, but not all deposited carbon was permanently buried. Remineralization of the organic carbon accrued in productive lakes may potentially generate CO2, as well as CH4, which promotes these lakes to act as greenhouse gas emitters.					; Hamilton, David/F-5039-2012; Schipper, Louis/F-1605-2010; Santoso, Arianto/AAB-6636-2019; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012	Santoso, Arianto/0000-0001-5437-8306; Schipper, Louis/0000-0001-9899-1276; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					341	354		10.1007/s10750-017-3158-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3158-7													WOS:000401917000023

Before the Dam: A Fish-Mercury Contamination Baseline Survey at the Xingu River, Amazon Basin Before the Belo Monte Dam	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												In the last decades, mega-diverse rivers worldwide (e.g., the Amazon and their tributaries) have experienced several human-driven transformations, although impact assessments oftentimes lack baseline data or reference values to better estimate observed disturbances. Herein, we assessed THg and delta N-15 in fish muscle tissue to determine biomagnification processes, also including seasonal assessments, concerning Hg in fish from the Belo Monte reservoir, located on the Xingu River, prior to its impoundment. A total of 312 samples from 19 fish species belonging to distinct feeding guilds were sampled. None presented THg concentrations above the threshold levels of 0.5 mu g g(-1) established by the World Health Organization. However, biomagnification was observed (R = 0.8; p < 0.001), also confirmed by a trophic magnification factor of 1.76 for the entire food web. The THg content in the water was less than 0.001 mg L-1 and only Hemiodus unimaculatus presented seasonal variations for THg. Therefore, at the time of this study, the Xingu River presented low Hg contamination levels in both water and target fish.					; Hauser-Davis, Rachel/C-7970-2013; Giarrizzo, Tommaso/G-8482-2016; Andrades, Ryan/E-6016-2015	de Souza Araujo, Juliana/0000-0002-3866-8669; 													0007-4861	1432-0800				MAY	2022	108	5					861	866		10.1007/s00128-021-03371-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03371-9		SEP 2021						34524505					WOS:000696152000001
J	Zhang, SY; Liu, YX; Yang, YH; Sun, C; Li, FX				Zhang, Siyu; Liu, Yongxue; Yang, Yuhao; Sun, Chao; Li, Feixue			Erosion and deposition within Poyang Lake: evidence from a decade of satellite data	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Poyang Lake, an important wetland in the Ramsar Convention List, is the largest freshwater lake in China and an essential component of the Yangtze River system. The lake is increasingly experiencing serious water crises including seasonal desiccation, decreased wetland area, and water shortages, all of which are closely related to progressive changes in the lake's topography over recent years. Atime-series of bottom topography would contribute to our understanding of the lake's evolution during the past several decades. However, quality bathymetric data for Poyang Lake are scarce owing to the highly dynamic and turbid nature of its water. To resolve this limitation, we used a total of 146 medium-resolution satellite images to build annual and quasi-annual bottom topography maps of Poyang Lake during the period from 2000 to 2010 based on the well-established waterline method. Our results show that: (1)the average elevation of the lakebed relative to sea level has decreased by 14.4 cm/yr. from 2000 to 2010; and (2)the observed annual changes in the lakebed elevation were well correlated (r = 0.84) with measured changes in the lake's annual net sediment flux. The observed trends may be attributed to the impacts of human activities, especially the operation of the Three Gorge Dams, frequent sand mining, and the implementation of a large water conservancy project. This decade-long quantitative understanding of the lake's evolution and bottom topography elevations might assist both researchers and local policymakers in ecological management, wetland protection, and lake navigation safety.

Irrigation canals in a semi-arid agricultural landscape surrounded by wetlands: Their role as a habitat for birds during the breeding season	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Traditional water supply systems in semi-arid agrarian ecosystems, mainly irrigation canals, contribute to the diversity of the landscape and influence the composition of species. To evaluate their effect on bird communities in the breeding season, we selected a rural area in southeastern Spain, where an intricate and extensive network of irrigation canals and cultivated areas is located between two wetlands declared as Natural Parks. Birds were counted at representative points distributed throughout the canal network at which we recorded several variables related to the physical features, the vertical and horizontal structure of associated vegetation, reed development (Phragmites australis) and land use in the neighboring areas. We detected 37 bird species, most of which were also breeding in the wetlands nearby. We used Hierarchical Partitioning analyses to identify the variables most strongly related to the probability of the presence of selected species and species richness. Vegetation cover and height close to the canals, together with reed development, were the most important types of variables explaining species presence and richness. We found that current management practices for reeds in canals are not well-suited for biodiversity conservation. We therefore propose alternatives that could be implemented in the area in cooperation with stakeholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wen, XL; Xi, YL; Qian, FP; Zhang, G; Xiang, XL				Wen, Xin-Li; Xi, Yi-Long; Qian, Fang-Ping; Zhang, Gen; Xiang, Xian-Ling			Comparative analysis of rotifer community structure in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China: role of physical and chemical conditions	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Worldwide, there have been few comparative studies on rotifer communities in subtropical lakes. We studied changes in rotifer community structure over 1 year and its relationship to several physicochemical variables in five subtropical shallow lakes in East China, covering a nutrient gradient from mesotrophy to moderate eutrophy. In these lakes, the genera Brachionus, Lecane, and Trichocerca dominated the rotifer species composition, and Polyarthra dolichoptera, Keratella cochlearis, Filinia longiseta, T. pusilla, and Anuraeopsis fissa were the dominant species. With increased nutrient loading, total rotifer abundance and species dominance increased, indicating that rotifer abundance might be a more sensitive indicator of trophic state than species composition. Comparative analyses of the six rotifer community indices calculated in this study and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the two slightly eutrophic lakes and the other two moderately eutrophic lakes exhibited a high degree similarity in community structure. This suggests that the trophic state of a lake determines the rotifer community structure. In contrast, in the two moderately eutrophic lakes, the mass ratios of TN:TP and the contents of TP suggested N-limitation and cyanobacteria dominance in phytoplankton communities might be possible. In these lakes TN played a more important role in shaping the rotifer community according to stepwise multiple regression and RDA. RDA analysis also suggested that rotifer species distribution was strongly associated with trophic state and water temperature, with water temperature being the most important factor in determining seasonality.

The current study characterized the DOM properties and source apportionment in the inflowing rivers of Dianchi Lake, the sixth largest freshwater lake in China suffering from organic pollution, during the rainy season by using spectroscopic and carbon stable isotope techniques, and the regulation role of land use was assessed. The results showed that land use (urbanized, agricultural, or mixed) largely affected DOM properties. Greater concentrations and fluorescence intensities of DOM with low aromaticity and dominant autochthonous sources were observed in the urban rivers than in the agricultural rivers. The proportion of humic-like substances increased, while that of tryptophan-like matter decreased from upstream to downstream of two main urban rivers. DOM in the agricultural rivers was characterized by more amounts of aromatic humic-like substances with dominant allochthonous sources compared to that in the urban rivers. Stable isotope analysis showed that the decomposition of macrophytes and input of terrestrial sources from C3 plant-dominated soil and sewage were the major DOM origins in the rivers. The positive linear relationship between the chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration and fluorescence intensities of terrigenous DOM components implied the necessity of controlling exogenous inputs to alleviate organic pollution in the Dianchi Lake.

This study explored seasonal patterns of DOM concentration and composition and the consequent effect on estrone (E1) biodegradation in water columns at the northern bays of Lake Taihu. During bloom seasons, the increased concentration of autochthonous DOM (autoDOM) with higher Fresh/Humic ratios, lower aromatics, molecular weights, and humification degrees exhibited a more substantial promotion on E1 biodegradation than the processed autoDOM after algal bloom. Meanwhile, the inflow rivers imported high -molecular-weight humic-like substances with strong aromaticity in flood seasons, impairing the E1 biodegradation of affected regions. End-member mixing experiments further confirmed that the mixing of algal-derived DOM facilitated the mediation of river water-derived DOM in E1 biodegradation, but microbial ageing reduced the promotive effect of autoDOM and resulted in a weak relationship between DOM source indicators and E1 biodegradation. A significant and positive correlation was further found between E1 biodegradation and DOM bioreactivity (P < 0.001), both of which were well predicted by DOM optical properties as predictor variables in partial least squares regression (PLS-R) modelling (R-2 values of 0.78 and 0.90, respectively). The ratio of fluorescence peak T and C was identified as the most effective predictor, and SUVA254 and slope ratio (SR) were moderately influential factors controlling carbon-normalized E1 biodegradation potential. These results suggested that while algal blooms would likely cause enhanced biotransformation of estrogens in freshwater lakes, the import of allochthonous DOM or the microbially aged autoDOM with high-molecular-weight may lead to higher estrogen concentrations in post-bloom seasons.

The "Water for all" project has sought to develop a multi-disciplinary science case for innovative management of water levels and flows in a lowland catchment in Scotland. Water demands of arable agriculture, protection from flood risk and conservation needs of lowland mesotrophic wetlands needed to be considered. Water management strategy focused on the outlet zone of Balgavies lake in Eastern Scotland, where the Lunan Water discharges into a partially confined common channel (lade). Water releases to a mill, to the downstream river, and to floodplain wetlands (Chapel Mires) are partially controlled by an existing weir. Based on observations of management of this weir, we postulated that upgrading hydraulic management in this zone could reduce upstream flood risk, help protect mesotrophic wetlands and facilitate downstream water supply at low flows. We considered potential for: (a) installing a remotely operated tilting weir, for improved management of release and routing of flows from the common lade; (b) dredging of the common lade in combination or instead of the tilting weir. Rapid ecological assessment and mixing analysis of the Lunan Water with waters in Chapel Mires showed a gradient of trophic status across the wetlands linked to impact of river-borne nutrients. Stage-discharge relationships, derived from steady-state approximations of the in-channel hydraulics, showed that the proposed tilting weir had potential to divert seasonal nutrient rich water from the upstream Lake away from Chapel Mires. Significant impact of the proposed weir on upstream flood risk was not demonstrated, but carrying out dredging of the channel reduced the current observed probability of upstream flooding. The proposed weir could help to maintain these dredging benefits. Survey and interviews with catchment stakeholders and residents showed constructive interest in the scheme, with half of the respondents willing to pay to support its implementation. The survey also revealed concerns about the proposed project, especially its long-term governance. The lessons learned have wider relevance to development of an integrated approach to water ecosystem services provision, especially where benefits are uncertain and thinly spread across a range of users.

We present findings on the demography of a population inhabiting the floodplain of Manu National Park, south-eastern Peru, arising from 14 annual dry season censuses over a 16 year period. The breeding system of territorial groups, including only a single breeding female with non-reproductive adult 'helpers', resulted in a low intrinsic rate of increase (0.03) and a slow recovery from decades of hunting for the pelt trade. This is explained by a combination of factors: (1) physiological traits such as late age at first reproduction and long generation time, (2) a high degree of reproductive skew, (3) small litters produced only once a year, and (4) a 50% mortality between den emergence and age of dispersal, as well as high mortality amongst dispersers (especially males). Female and male giant otters show similar traits with respect to average reproductive life-spans (female 5.4 yrs., male 5.2 yrs.) and average cub productivity (female 6.9, male 6.7 cubs per lifetime); the longest reproductive life spans were 11 and 13 years respectively. Individual reproductive success varied substantially and depended mainly on the duration of dominance tenure in the territory. When breeding females died, the reproductive position in the group was usually occupied by sisters or daughters (n = 11), with immigrant male partners. Male philopatry was not observed. The vulnerability of the Manu giant otter population to anthropogenic disturbance emphasises the importance of effective protection of core lake habitats in particular. Riverine forests are the most endangered ecosystem in the Department of Madre de Dios due to the concentration of gold mining, logging and agricultural activities in floodplains, highlighting the need for a giant otter habitat conservation corridor along the Madre de Dios River.

Because the surface water contains treated sewage. wastewater residues are present in surface water and groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers, including tritium and helium isotopes (H-3, He-3, He-4), stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and a number of persistent sewage indicators, such as chloride. boron and a selection of pharmaceutical residues (phenazone-type analgesics and their metabolites, carbamazepine and anthropogenic gadolinium, Gd-excess), were used to estimate travel times from the surface water to individual production and observation wells at two sites. The study revealed a strong vertical age stratification throughout the upper aquifer, with travel times varying from a few months to several decades in greater depth. Whereas the shallow bank filtrate is characterized by the reflection of the time-variant tracer input concentrations and young H-3/He-3 ages, the deeper, older bank filtrate displays no tracer seasonality, H-3/He-3 ages of a few years to decades and strongly deviating concentrations of several pharmaceutical residues, reflecting concentrations of the source surface water over time. The phenazone-type pharmaceuticals persist in the aquatic environments for decades. Bank filtration in Berlin is only possible at the sandy lakeshores. In greater water depth, impermeable lacustrine sapropels inhibit infiltration. The young bank filtrate originates from the nearest shore, whereas the older bank filtrate infiltrates at more distant shores. This paper illustrates the importance of using multiple tracer methods, capable of resolving a broad range of residence times, to gain a comprehensive understanding of time-scales and infiltration characteristics in a bank filtration system.

J	Sterner, RW				Sterner, Robert W.			C:N:P stoichiometry in Lake Superior: freshwater sea as end member	INLAND WATERS												New and synthesized information about linked carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles in Lake Superior indicate the ways that Earth's largest lake by area can be considered extreme, unusual, or an end member among lakes. Lake Superior is characterized by low P concentration but excess nitrate and high TN:TP and NO3-:PO43- ratios. Nitrate levels continue to rise in Lake Superior. Rates of primary productivity are modest, but due to spatial structuring as well as long food chain lengths, only small fractions of that organic carbon are likely usable by top trophic levels. Similarly, due to great depth and consequent efficient C cycling, low organic C concentrations are present at the redox boundary in the lake sediments. In this study, changes in biomass C, N, and P as a function of season and depth are presented for Lake Superior in more detail than previous studies. Linkages between biomass and P were weak at best, which was unexpected given the N: P imbalance in the lake. Both seston C and chlorophyll showed distinct mid-depth maxima, but these relatively large biomass pools were spatially removed from the main stratum involved in primary productivity. Seston P also was most concentrated within the mid-depth biomass maximum. Lake Superior is unusual among lakes in terms of N:P balance, and the limited availability of organic C to promote denitrification is a plausible mechanism to explain this.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2011	1	1					29	46		10.5268/IW-1.1.365	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-1.1.365													WOS:000307720400002

So far, most studies on MCs have been limited to two small bays, while systematic research on the whole lake is lacking. To explain the variations in MC concentrations during cyanobacterial bloom, a large-scale survey at 30 sites across the lake was conducted monthly in 2008. The health risks of MC exposure were high, especially in the northern area. Both Microcystis abundance and MC cellular quotas presented positive correlations with MC concentration in the bloom seasons, suggesting that the toxic risks during Microcystis proliferations were affected by variations in both Microcystis density and MC production per Microcystis cell. Use of a powerful predictive modeling tool named generalized additive model (GAM) helped visualize significant effects of abiotic factors related to carbon fixation and proliferation of Microcystis (conductivity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), water temperature and pH) on MC cellular quotas from recruitment period of Microcystis to the bloom seasons, suggesting the possible use of these factors, in addition to Microcystis abundance, as warning signs to predict toxic events in the future. The interesting relationship between macrophytes and MC cellular quotas of Microcystis (i.e., high MC cellular quotas in the presence of macrophytes) needs further investigation.

J	Gu, B				Gu, B.			Variations and controls of nitrogen stable isotopes in particulate organic matter of lakes	OECOLOGIA												Nitrogen stable isotope (delta N-15) data of particulate organic matter (POM) from the literature were analyzed to provide an understanding of the variations and controls of delta N-15(POM) in lakes at the global scale. The delta N-15(POM) variability characterized by seasonal mean, minimum, maximum, and amplitude (defined as delta N-15(POM) maximum - delta N-15(POM) minimum) from 36 lakes with seasonal data did not change systematically with latitude, but was significantly lower in small lakes than in large lakes. The seasonal mean delta N-15(POM) increased from oligotrophic lakes to eutrophic lakes despite large variations that are attributed to the occurrences of nitrogen fixation across the trophic gradient and the differences in delta N-15 of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in individual lakes. Seasonal mean delta N-15(POM) was significantly correlated with DIN concentration and delta N-15(DIN) in two subsets of lakes. Seasonal minimum delta N-15(POM) in individual lakes is influenced by nitrogen fixation and delta N-15(DIN) while seasonal maximum delta N-15(POM) is influenced by lake trophic state and delta N-15(DIN). As a result of the dominance of non-living POM in the unproductive surface waters, seasonal delta N-15(POM) amplitude was small (mean = 4.2aEuro degrees) in oligotrophic lakes of all latitudes. On the other hand, seasonal delta N-15(POM) amplitude in eutrophic lakes was large (mean = 10.3aEuro degrees), and increased from low to high latitudes, suggesting that the seasonal variability of delta N-15 in the phytoplankton-dominated POM pool was elevated by the greater spans of solar radiation and thermal regimes at high latitudes. The delta N-15(POM) from 42 lakes with no seasonal data revealed no consistent patterns along latitude, lake area, and trophic gradients, and a greater than 2aEuro degrees depletion compared to the lakes with seasonal data. Along with the large seasonal variability of delta N-15(POM) within lakes, these results provide insightful information on sampling design for the studies of food web baseline in lakes.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	2009	160	3					421	431		10.1007/s00442-009-1323-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1323-z								19352718					WOS:000266010800002

In particular, the role of short-lived reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g. singlet oxygen (1O(2)), in altering microbial activity and species composition has scarcely been investigated. Therefore, we have artificially increased the natural rate of 1O(2) formation in short-term (similar to 4 h) in situ and long-term (72 h) laboratory incubations of surface water samples from a humic acid-rich lake. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns revealed significant changes in occurrence of abundant bacterioplankton phylotypes upon 1O(2) exposure. Cluster analysis of DGGE patterns showed that a moderate increase in 1O(2) exposure leads to similar changes in different years indicating the establishment of bacterial communities adapted to 1O(2) exposure. Bacterioplankton phylotypes favoured under these conditions belonged to Betaproteobacteria of the beta II cluster (e.g. Polynucleobacter necessarius) and the beta I cluster related to Limnohabitans (R-BT subcluster) as well as Alphaproteobacteria affiliated to Novosphingobium acidiphilum. In contrast, Actinobacteria of the freshwater acI-B cluster were sensitive even against moderate 1O(2) exposure. We conclude that 1O(2) exposure due to DOM photolysis represents an important natural selective factor affecting bacterial species dynamics in aquatic ecosystems in many ways.

Retrospective and Predictive Investigation of Fish Kill Events	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Fish kill investigations are critical to understanding threats to aquatic ecosystems and can serve as a measure of environmental disruption as well as an early indicator of emerging disease. The goal of this study was to analyze historical data related to such events among wild fish populations in Minnesota in order to assess the quality and completeness of the data and potential trends in fish kills. After excluding events with incomplete data (e.g., in which the location was not reported), we analyzed 225 unique fish kills from 2003 to 2013 that were recorded in two Minnesota Department of Natural Resources databases. The most reported fish kills occurred during 2007 (n = 41) and during the month of June (n = 81) across all years. Centrarchid species were present in the most fish kills (138), followed by cyprinid and ictalurid species, which were present in 53 and 40 events, respectively. Environmental factors were the most common cause of death reported. Models of environmental factors revealed that the maximum nighttime land surface temperature was the most critical factor in fish mortality, followed by changes in primary productivity and human disturbances. During the course of this study, data gaps were identified, including underreporting, inconsistent investigation, and the lack of definitive diagnoses, making interpretation of our results challenging. Even so, understanding these historical trends and data gaps can be useful in generating hypotheses and advancing data collection systems for investigating future fish kills. Our study is a primer investigation of fish kills providing information on the plausible areas, seasons, and fish groups at risk that can guide active environmental monitoring and epidemiological surveillance of fishes.					; BUENO, IRENE/ABA-5868-2020; Escobar, Luis/I-2204-2019	Escobar, Luis E./0000-0001-5735-2750; Bueno, Irene/0000-0003-3619-3038; Phelps, Nicholas/0000-0003-3116-860X; 													0899-7659	1548-8667				MAR	2019	31	1					61	70		10.1002/aah.10054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aah.10054								30735267					WOS:000461874100006

Microbial food-web components in two hypertrophic human-impacted Pampean shallow lakes: interactive effects of environmental, hydrological, and temporal drivers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Few studies have intensively assessed the dynamic of all planktonic components and their microbial communities in hypertrophic shallow lakes. The aim of this work was to study the potential drivers shaping the microbial food-web components (heterotrophic bacteria and strictly phototrophic microplankton). Thus, we studied the monthly abundances and functional groups of the different planktonic food-web components (heterotrophic bacteria, picocyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, phytoplankton, zooplankton) in two interconnected and hypertrophic Pampean shallow lakes (Gomez and Carpincho) during dry-wet periods (27-month study). We hypothesized that temporal (intra and inter-annual) factors exert a major role in shaping the microbial food-web components in both lakes. Both shallow lakes showed similar dynamic in the environmental variables, that followed inter-annual and seasonal variations. In Gomez, the variation of microbial components was mainly explained by a combination of environmental, predation, and temporal factors (38.2%), whereas in Carpincho by pure temporal drivers (31.8%). Microbial and predator components were significantly different between dry and wet periods. The connection and closeness between both lakes seem not to play a major role in the factors driving the microbial component abundances. These lakes are strongly influenced by temporal factors, which regulate not only the microbial components, but also the physical, chemical, and biological variables.					; Quiroga, Maria/JUV-5976-2023	Marfetan Molina, Diego/0000-0003-4638-0902; Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003; Quiroga, Maria Victoria/0000-0002-6223-334X													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2019	830	1					255	276		10.1007/s10750-018-3874-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3874-7													WOS:000457403000017

Agricultural activities of 21 rice farms in Jinze Town nearby Dianshan Lake were tracked and investigated for the consecutive 5years, with the questionnaires on the inputs of agro-chemicals within the rice-growing seasons under the conventional rice farming in detail. The nutrient amounts discharged from the conventional rice fields were calculated and these from the rice-duck integrated organic farming potentially implemented surrounding the lake were also estimated. The quantities of N and P2O5 applied to the conventional paddy fields of the six towns surrounding the lake were 2.01x10(6)kg a(-1) and 4.59x10(5)kg a(-1) on annual average, respectively; these discharged into the environment were estimated to 1.48x10(5)kg a(-1) and 1.34x10(4)kg a(-1) on annual average, respectively. The quantities of herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides discharged from the conventional rice fields of the six towns were 1.67x10(4)kg a(-1) on annual average. The potential replacement of the conventional rice farming by the rice-duck integrated organic farming around the lake will reduce the amounts of N and P2O5 discharges through runoff and leaching by 83.79% and 92.11%, respectively, and completely prevent the diffuse pollution of biocides. The implementation of the rice-duck integrated organic farming around Dianshan Lake will not only be beneficial to lake protection, but also to raising the incomes of local farmers, and, thus, should be highly encouraged.					; Hu, Xue-Feng/AFY-2241-2022	Teng, Qing/0000-0002-1595-2931; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2019	78	5							171	10.1007/s12665-019-8183-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8183-6													WOS:000460121600002

The dam's operation has affected the resources and environment in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, changing the hydrological conditions and ecological environment of the Dongting Lake. During three different dispatching periods of the reservoir, we took triplicate samples of the river and lake water. All the samples were analysed for delta H-2 and delta O-18 to determine the relationship between the lake and the Yangtze River (and other rivers), and to evaluate objectively the influence of the dam's operation on the lake. During the period of water-supply dispatch, the Four Rivers and Miluo River are the main recharge sources of the lake. During the flood-storage dispatching period, the Dongting Lake is recharged largely by the Three Outlets and the Four Rivers, whereas during the period of water-storage dispatch, most of the lake's water originates from the Miluo, Xiang, Zi, and Yuan rivers. Although the Yangtze River only contributes significantly to the lake's recharge through the Three Outlets during the flood-storage dispatching period, the lake discharges large amounts of water into the Yangtze River during all three periods. Through the operation of the reservoir, it should be ensured that the water level of the Dongting Lake is not too low during the dry season, nor too high during the wet season, thus preventing the lake region from future flood and drought disasters.

The spatial-temporal distributions and occurrence of soluble trace elements were studied in the surrounding ten rivers in the Chaohu Lake Basin as well as water quality and risk assessment during the normal and wet seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the main source of river pollution during the two seasons was the mining industry. High values of most elements were found in the northwestern rivers in the two seasons. The temporal changes in the elements showed that the distributions of As, Mn, Cd, and Cu in the two seasons were very different, but the trends of Ni, Co, and V were basically the same. The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) showed that almost all river samples needed to be treated before irrigation, and the water quality index (WQI) showed that most samples were of excellent water quality for drinking. The ecological risk assessment results showed that the risks in the two seasons were all slight. The results of the health risk evaluation suggested that no noncarcinogenic risks were found in the normal season and that the carcinogenic risks from Cr and As reached their highest levels in the normal and wet seasons, respectively. This research can provide vital data for rational water control and water quality conservation, offer a scientific basis for ecological environment safety, and offer a reference for carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risks to regional residents.

Herbicide Treatment and Application Method Influence Root Sprouting in Chinese Tallowtree (Triadica sebifera)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Chinese tallowtree is an invasive tree found throughout the southeastern United States and in California. Its negative effects can be seen in numerous natural and managed ecosystems, including bottomland hardwood forests, pastures, pine plantations, and along lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers. Despite its troublesome presence for many decades, relatively few effective control strategies are available. Root sprouting following management efforts is a major impediment to successful control. Studies were conducted in Alabama and Louisiana at three locations to test several herbicides for cut stump, basal bark, and foliar individual plant treatment (IPT) methods. Herbicide treatments included triclopyr amine and ester formulations, imazamox, aminopyralid, aminocyclopyrachlor, and fluroxypyr. Data were collected just before leaf senescence at one and two growing seasons after treatment and included Chinese tallowtree foliar cover, number of stump or root collar sprouts, and number of sprouts originating from lateral roots within a 1-m radius of each tree. For the cut stump and basal bark studies, most herbicide treatments prevented sprouting from the stump or root collar region better than they did from the lateral roots. Aminopyralid reduced total sprouting better than all other treatments in the cut stump study. The high rates of aminocyclopyrachlor and fluroxypyr resulted in the highest mortality in the basal bark study. Aminocyclopyrachlor reduced total sprouting better than all other herbicides in the foliar treatment study. Triclopyr amine and ester formulations, which are commercial standards, did not consistently control Chinese tallowtree across these IPT studies. These studies provide some promising treatments to increase the number of effective tools that can be used to manage Chinese tallowtree. Additional research is needed to address the prolific nature of lateral root sprouting following any of these treatment methods.																			1939-7291	1939-747X				APR-JUN	2015	8	2					160	168		10.1614/IPSM-D-14-00062.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-D-14-00062.1													WOS:000357940900006

In view of that, the water flooding practice can increase soil P release and enhance P availability in rice season, compared with the strong P fixation in wheat season; it seems possible to save P fertilizer in rice season with the aim of reducing P loads without any crop yield declines. To validate this possibility, a 4-year pot experiment encompassing eight rice/wheat seasons and using four paddy soils with varying Olsen-P contents (6.16 to 40.95 mg kg(-1)) was conducted to compare rice/wheat yield, inorganic and organic P accumulation under four different P regimes, P fertilization for both rice and wheat (PR + W; conventional practice), P fertilization only for wheat (PW), P fertilization only for rice (PR), and no P fertilization for both seasons (Pzero). Compared with conventional PR + W treatment, PR treatment significantly decreased wheat yields, especially in medium- and low-P soils, with an Olsen-P concentrate decline of 34.4-62.8 %. In contrast, PW treatment showed no significant difference in the rice/wheat yields over 4 years irrespective of high-, medium-, and low-P-concentrated soils, despite the soil Olsen-P concentration declining by 34.9-64.4 %. This highlights the feasibility of omitting P fertilizer application to flooded rice for at least 4 years in rice/wheat cropping paddy fields while maintaining crop yields and reducing environmental risk. In four paddy soils, available inorganic P was the dominant effective P source and increased with the concentration of Olsen-P. Without P fertilization over time, the concentration of soil inorganic P fractions declined and organic P remained relatively constant. According to the P supply capacity of different soils under the regime of omitting P fertilization for rice, how to utilize the bioavailability of P in different P supply capacity soils when P fertilization is omitted for rice crops will be required in future work.

Geomorphological habitat type drives variation in temporal species turnover but not temporal nestedness in Amazonian fish assemblages	OIKOS												Explaining the mechanisms underlying spatial and temporal variation in community composition is a major challenge. Nevertheless, the processes controlling temporal variation at a site (i.e. temporal beta-diversity, including its turnover and nestedness components) are less understood than those affecting variation among sites (i.e. spatial beta-diversity). Short-term temporal turnover (e.g. throughout an annual cycle) is expected to correlate positively with seasonal environmental variability and landscape connectivity, but also species pool size (gamma-diversity). We use the megadiverse Amazonian freshwater ichthyofauna as a model to ask whether seasonality and landscape connectivity drive variation in temporal species turnover among geomorphological habitat types, while accounting for between-habitat variation in gamma-diversity. We collected 11 397 fish representing 260 species during a year-long sampling program from an area containing the lowland Amazon's four major geomorphological habitat types: rivers, floodplains, terra firme streams, and shield streams. River-floodplain systems exhibit strong but predictable seasonality (via a high-amplitude annual flood pulse), high connectivity, and high species richness with many rare species. Terra firme and shield streams exhibit low seasonality, low connectivity, and low species richness with proportionally fewer rare species. Based on these parameters we predicted that river-floodplain systems should have higher temporal turnover than stream systems. Using a null model approach combined with beta-deviation calculations, we confirmed that rivers and floodplains do exhibit higher turnover (but not nestedness) than terra firme and shield streams, even when controlling for the potentially confounding effect of higher species richness in river-floodplain systems. All habitats exhibit low temporal nestedness, indicating that short-term changes in community composition result primarily from temporal species turnover. Our results provide a timely reminder that efforts to conserve the Amazon's threatened aquatic biodiversity should account for the distinct temporal dynamics of habitat types and variation in hydrological seasonality.

Damming effects on hydrological abundance and eco-hydrological alteration in upstream wetlands of Eastern Himalaya	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The effects of dams on hydrological conditions and ecological functioning of wetlands downstream are less well studied. Rivers and wetlands are vital environmental elements linked to natural and human ecosystems, so it is extremely important to study ecohydrological planning and human well-being. This study investigates the impact of the dam on the hydrological abundance and eco-hydrological alterations of Loktak Lake, which is located upstream of the Ithai barrage. For this purpose, the Indicator of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) was used to examine the ecohydrological threshold, failure rate, impact magnitude and ecohydrological deficit/surplus in a river section and the adjacent wetland in three temporal phases (I, 1996-2001; II, 2006-2011; and III, 2016-2021). The results show that the hydrological surplus has recently increased to 27.22% (phase III), while in phase I it was only 1.1%. Due to the decreasing failure rate of ecological optima, eco-hydrological surplus was recorded in both Loktak lakes, which is an obvious indication of a reduction in ecological distress that may lead to negative impacts on natural and human well-being. However, due to the constant high-water level in the lake, Phumdi is no longer able to reach the bottom of the lake during the dry season. Since it cannot absorb nutrients, the lake's vegetation declines and rotting sediments settle. Since the Ithai Dam closed the outlet that once connected the lake to the sea, fishermen can no longer dispose of the decomposing biomass. This study is important for dam management and planning to consider the impacts on wetlands downstream and to take measures to mitigate these impacts.

J	Sunkara, SV; Singh, R				Sunkara, Sai Veena; Singh, Riddhi			Assessing the impact of the temporal resolution of performance indicators on optimal decisions of a water resources system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Large scale water infrastructure serves multiple purposes including provisioning of freshwater, protection from floods, navigation, hydro-electricity, etc. Decision analysis for reservoir systems relies heavily on optimization techniques that identify optimal operational strategies using a dynamic systems model. Optimization requires the analyst to define performance indicators, or, objective functions, that aggregate performance across multiple time periods in a planning horizon. A question thus arises: does the temporal resolution at which objective functions are aggregated have a substantial impact on resultant optimal operational strategy? Here, we investigate this issue using three formulations of a multi-objective optimization problem for a proposed inter-basin water transfer in Southern India. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to optimize five objectives: the reliability, resilience and vulnerability of demand satisfaction, reliability of maintaining minimum environmental flows, and reliability of preventing high flow exceedances downstream. We alter the temporal resolution at which the reliability of demand satisfaction is calculated by aggregating water deficits at fortnightly, seasonal and annual scale, resulting in three formulations of the decision problem. Pareto approximate strategies resulting from the fortnightly, seasonal, and annual reliability formulations result in annual demand deficits ranging from 82 to 172 Mm(3), 79-152 Mm(3), and 61-96 Mm(3), respectively. This improvement in performance for annual reliability-based strategies exploits greater flexibility within the systems model to store water temporarily in secondary storage structures like lakes, ponds, check dams, in the command area serviced by the project. We also find that the choice of temporal resolution of objective function has a substantial in-fluence on the combination operators preferred during the search phase of the Borg MOEA. Our results highlight the value of exploring objective functions at different temporal resolutions for reservoir optimization.

Structure dynamics of a fish community over ten years of formation in the reservoir of the hydroelectric power plant in upper Uruguay River	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure of the fish assemblage in the ten years following the closing of the lake of the Ita Hydroelectric Power Plant. Seasonal collections were conducted from 2001 to 2010. During this period, 44,834 fish were captured, totaling 3,818.01 kg, among 8 orders, 24 families and 84 species. In general, profound changes were not observed in the fish assemblage in the ten years after the formation of the Ita lake. Few species changed in dominance over time, while many were rare in the environment. The ichthyofauna in the reservoir was dominated by small and medium size opportunist species that conduct short or no migratory movements. Among the most abundant, six species were responsible for more than 50% of the numeric representation: Steindachnerina brevipinna, Astyanax fasciatus, Apareiodon affinis, Hypostomus isbrueckeri, Iheringichthys labrosus and Loricariichthys anus. The increase in the representation of the later species stood out. The biomass was dominated by Steindachneridion scriptum, Prochilodus lineatus, I. laborsus, Schizodon nasutus, Hoplias malabaricus, Acestrorhynchus pantaneiro, Hoplias lacerdae, H. isbrueckeri and L. anus. Despite the presence of large migrators in the region of the reservoir, their vulnerability was revealed by the low numeric abundance and accidental capture. The k-dominance curve of numerical abundance and biomass indicates a moderately disturbed community, in which the representation of small species was also important to the amounts of biomass.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2017	77	4					710	723		10.1590/1519-6984.17015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.17015								28562786					WOS:000414017100007

To assess heavy metal contamination, heavy metal in water body and riverbed sediments was investigated in the flood and dry seasons in 2013 at 8 sites along the Yanghe River. All heavy metal concentrations in water body were very low and less than the threshold value of drinking water quality standard of China. There was no significant correlation between heavy metal pollution in water body and riverbed sediments. Sediment pollution was assessed by five approaches including pollution load index (PLI), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), potential ecological risk index (RI), cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The results of heavy metal contamination in riverbed sediments showed that: (1) the mean PLI in the range of 1.0-1.1 indicated a progressive deterioration, and the I-geo revealed the pollution in the order of Cd > Cu > Zn > Pb > Cr; (2) the RI presented that the pollution in the downstream was much higher than that in the upstream; (3) the contamination decreased in the upstream due to decreased domestic wastewater where far from the development zone Funing Town, while it increased in the downstream because of dense population and tourists in the coastal zone; and (4) the PCA and FA demonstrate that domestic sewage was a major source of heavy metal contamination.

J	Gao, L; Zheng, M; Fraser, M; Huang, YS				Gao, Li; Zheng, Mei; Fraser, Matthew; Huang, Yongsong			Comparable hydrogen isotopic fractionation of plant leaf wax n-alkanoic acids in arid and humid subtropical ecosystems	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Leaf wax hydrogen isotope proxies have been widely used to reconstruct past hydrological changes. However, published reconstructions have given little consideration for the potentially variable hydrogen isotopic fractionation relative to precipitation (epsilon wax-p) under different climate and environmental settings. Chief among various potential factors controlling fractionation is relative humidity, which is known to strongly affect oxygen isotopic ratios of plant cellulose, but its effect on hydrogen isotopic fractionation of leaf waxes is still ambiguous. Analyses of lake surface sediments and individual modern plants have provided valuable information on the variability of epsilon wax-p, but both approaches have significant limitations. Here, we present an alternative method to obtain the integrated, time-resolved ecosystem-level epsilon wax-p values, by analyzing modern aerosol samples collected weekly from arid (Arizona lowlands) and humid subtropical (Atlanta, Georgia) environments during the main growth season. Because aerosol samples mainly reflect regional leaf wax resources, the extreme contrast in the hydroclimate and associated vegetation assemblages between our study sites allows us to rigorously assess the impact of relative humidity and associated vegetation assemblages on leaf wax hydrogen isotopic fractionation. We show there is only minor difference (mostly <10 parts per thousand) in the mean epsilon wax-p values in the two end-member environments. One possible explanation is that the positive isotopic effects of low relative humidity are offset by progressive replacement of trees with grasses that have a more negative apparent fractionation. Our results represent an important step toward quantitative interpretation of leaf wax hydrogen isotopic records.

J	Pino, M; Chávez-Hoffmeister, M; Navarro-Harris, X; Labarca, R				Pino, Mario; Chavez-Hoffmeister, Martin; Navarro-Harris, Ximena; Labarca, Rafael			The late Pleistocene Pilauco site, Osorno, south-central Chile	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Paleontological and archaeological sites have frequently been found in open locations of the Intermediate Depression of south-central Chile. This paper presents the results of two field sampling seasons carried out at the Pilauco Site (ca. 39 degrees S) and compares them with those of three well known sites in Chile: Quereo, Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, ca. 32 degrees, 34 degrees and 41 degrees S, respectively. Stratigraphic data collected at Pilauco and the resulting radiocarbon age model suggest that before 12,540 +/- 90 BP the old Damas River eroded an older volcaniclastic hill, which was followed by a bog formation in an ox-bow lake. The site was developing up to 11,004 +/- 186 BP, the date of the youngest vertebrate fossil. Two younger peat beds seal the site. As in Tagua-Tagua and Monte Verde, Gomphotheres are the most represented megafauna. Fossils of Equidae, Camelidae, Cervidae, Mephitidae, Muridae, Myocastoridae and Xenarthra are also found in Pilauco. As a whole, 718 bones, 30 teeth and 11 coprolites represent the extinct and extant vertebrates. Preliminary taphonomic results suggest action of various agents in the bones, i.e. trampling, root etching, abrasion, and carnivore gnawing. The spatial analysis suggests the transfer of smaller anatomical units (e.g. bones of camelids and horses) and the rearrangement of some pieces comparatively large (e.g. gomphothere bones). Similar to the present day north Patagonian landscape, the area where Pilauco site is located had a variety of animal resources, plants and stones in an ecotone between hills, floodplains and wetlands. A total of 101 lithics were recorded: basalt and quartzite were collected from nearby fluvial deposits and dacitic obsidian from the local volcaniclastic deposits. Debitage is the most represented lithic item (75%); cores and marginal edge-trimmed artifacts represented 12 and 13%, respectively. Artifacts and flakes are spatially and temporality associated in the same PB-7 bed with high bone concentrations in some specific areas, between 361 and 424 cm of local altitude. This industry is characterized by a recurrent lithic expedite technology with production of flakes and chips which mastered marginal retouches over the bifacial trimming. This seems to be connected to strategic conditions of high resource diversity, especially of human groups with a high or medium mobility across land. Pilauco represents a site contemporaneous to Monte Verde related as well to the first human occupation in the southern cone of South America, but with higher mammal diversity.

However, their quality needs to be validated prior to their use. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations version 2.0 (CHIRPS), the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data version 3.0 (TAMSAT3), and the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) satellite rainfall estimates in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin. Their skill of retrieval was evaluated against ground-measured rainfall at dekadal, monthly, and seasonal scales across agroclimatic zones over 2001 to 2017. Finally, these satellite products have demonstrated different levels of agreement with the reference data, being the highest for CHIRPS and the lowest for ARC2. At all timescales and agroclimatic zones, ARC2 has severely underestimated the actual rainfall while TAMSAT3 has persistently overestimated it. However, TAMSAT3 has demonstrated better performance than ARC2. Generally, except for its slightly larger dekadal false alarm ratio, CHIRPS has achieved the highest and most consistent agreement with the reference data at all the timescales and agroclimatic classes. Consequently, CHIRPS was further assessed for its suitability of drought monitoring, and it has exhibited promising skill in detecting specific historical drought events. Therefore, to overcome the scarcity of ground-measured rainfall data in the study area, we recommend the CHIRPS rainfall estimate to be used as an alternative data source for drought monitoring. Conversely, owing to its overestimation tendency, TAMSAT3 could be used for flood monitoring in this region.

The fish is an invasive species that extends its global distribution. The study aimed to assess the reproductive potential of the stone moroko in a new habitat in central Europe based on an analysis of the sexual cycle. A rapid sexual maturation and high-fecundity spawning in portions prolonged the four-month reproductive period, which enables a rapid increase in population size and density on a newly inhabited area. Furthermore, the smaller investment in gonad development in males allows them to retain vitality for nest protection and a longer reproductive season compared to the autochthonous cyprinid fish. The present study suggests that stone moroko population in Central Europe may exhibit a higher reproductive potential than native populations. Similar to other invasive species, stone moroko is extending its global distribution. The present study aimed to assess the reproductive potential of stone moroko fish in a new habitat in Poland based on analysing the sexual cycle and fecundity. Fish morphometric data, age, and gonadal structures were analysed. Fish age ranged from 0+ to 5+ years. Most females and males (93% and 60%, respectively) had reached sexual maturity in the first year of their life, with the smallest length of 25 mm and 28 mm, respectively. The mean, standard length of the body was 50 mm. The spawning season was spread over four months from late-April to mid-August. Females laid eggs in portions, and the absolute and relative fecundity was 1372 and 1691, respectively. Stone moroko males were ready to spawn for a longer time period than females. The present study shows greater reproductive potential of stone moroko population in the central Europe than the native population, suggesting its successful colonisation in the new habitat.					; Brysiewicz, Adam/AAE-7675-2020; Kirczuk, Lucyna/AAY-7889-2020; Czerniejewski, Przemyslaw/F-4037-2016; Czerniejewski, Przemysław/F-4037-2016	Brysiewicz, Adam/0000-0002-3032-7843; Czerniejewski, Przemyslaw/0000-0001-8553-9109; Dziewulska, Katarzyna/0000-0001-7439-8398; Kirczuk, Lucyna/0000-0003-3710-8982													2076-2615					SEP	2021	11	9							2627	10.3390/ani11092627	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11092627								34573593					WOS:000699094900001

The species Eurytemora carolleeae belongs to this complex. It was recently described and recognized as an invasive copepod for European waters. Since then, it was found in a few European estuaries. Based on molecular and morphological studies, we observed that E. carolleeae has expanded into new freshwater habitats in Central Europe. We carried out detailed morphological analysis for this species which indicates the potential higher stability of the populations in freshwater habitats compared to brackish waters. Fluctuating asymmetry did not significantly differ between freshwater and brackish water habitats, but the share of deformed specimens was considerably larger in brackish waters. We also found that season and habitat influenced the morphology of Eurytemora. In the molecular analyses, we focused on mitochondrial (COI) as well as nuclear gene markers (18S rDNA, ITS1-2) in E. carolleeae. In addition, for the first time, we analyzed the cytochrome b gene of the latter species. A wide distribution of E. carolleeae in the Oder River system in Central Europe indicates that it is a suitable habitat for the present populations and suggests further expansion of the species into continental waters.

OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												Coastal Lake Bardawil (Egypt) is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world. In 2009-2010, the authors studied composition, distribution and seasonal dynamics of copepods at 12 sites. A total of 10 species of copepods were recorded in zooplankton during the study period, including 5 Calanoida, 2 Cyclopoida and 3 Harpacticoida. Oithona nana was the most common and most abundant species. All copepods in the lake can be divided into three groups: 1) planktic species that form stable populations, 2) species of Mediterranean plankton incidentally entering the lake from the adjacent sea area, 3) benthic Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida that can be abundant in plankton. Two species - Acartia tonsa and A. danae were recorded here for the first time. The total abundance of copepods in the lake was significantly higher (90 times on average) compared to that observed in 2008-2009 in the waters of the Egyptian Mediterranean Sea. Since 1967, the complex of common and dominant copepod species in the lake has changed significantly. The total average annual copepod abundance varied: in 2002 - it was about 4000 ind. m(-3), in 2004 - 152 000 ind. m(-3), in 2005 - about 25 300 ind. m(-3), and in 2009-2010 - about 56 000 ind. m(-3).

However, few literatures involving spatial-temporal changes of lake SWT in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, including Qinghai Lake, are available. Our objective is to study the spatial-temporal changes in SWT of Qinghai Lake from 2001 to 2010, using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Based on each pixel, we calculated the temporal SWT variations and long-term trends, compared the spatial patterns of annual average SWT in different years, and mapped and analyzed the seasonal cycles of the spatial patterns of SWT. The results revealed that the differences between the average daily SWT and air temperature during the temperature decreasing phase were relatively larger than those during the temperature increasing phase. The increasing rate of the annual average SWT during the study period was about 0.01A degrees C/a, followed by an increasing rate of about 0.05A degrees C/a in annual average air temperature. The annual average SWT from 2001 to 2010 showed similar spatial patterns, while the SWT spatial changes from January to December demonstrated an interesting seasonal reversion pattern. The high-temperature area transformed stepwise from the south to the north regions and then back to the south region from January to December, whereas the low-temperature area demonstrated a reversed annual cyclical trace. The spatial-temporal patterns of SWTs were shaped by the topography of the lake basin and the distribution of drainages.

Four collections were carried out at each reservoir at two depths at three-month intervals. The following abiotic variables were analyzed: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, water transparency, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, orthophosphate and total nitrogen. Phytoplankton density was quantified for the determination of the biomass of cyanobacteria. The data were analyzed using CCA. Higher mean phytoplankton biomass values (29.8 mm(3).L-1) occurred in the period of thermal stratification. A greater similarity in the phytoplankton communities also occurred in this period and was related to the development of cyanobacteria, mainly Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (>3.9 mm(3).L-1). During the period of thermal destratification, this species co-dominated the environment with Planktothrix agardhii, Geitlerinema amphibium, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia tenuissima, as well as with diatoms and phytoflagellates. Environmental instability and competition among algae hindered the establishment of blooms more during the mixture period than during the stratification period. Thermal changes in the water column caused by climatologic events altered other physiochemical conditions of the water, leading to changes in the composition and biomass of the cyanobacterial community in tropical reservoirs.

J	Berardo, R; Turner, VK; Rice, S				Berardo, Ramiro; Turner, V. Kelly; Rice, Stian			Systemic coordination and the problem of seasonal harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												The management of natural resources may potentially be improved when governance structures in social-ecological systems enable coordination among multiple actors who may operate on the same or different geographic and/or governmental scales. In this article, we analyze the network of formal coordination ties that link governmental and nongovernmental actors in the Maumee River watershed, which is the largest source of phosphorus loading into Lake Erie, one of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a return of the seasonal harmful algal blooms (HAB) that were common in the 1960s and 1970s, and considerable research suggests that they might be triggered by excessive amounts of phosphorus produced by agriculture. Analyzing an assortment of documents that collectively detail how stakeholders relate to each other on the topic of nutrient management in the watershed, we examine who are the actors that are more likely to fulfill coordination roles, and the scales at which coordination takes place (vertically vs horizontally). Results suggest that coordination has been formalized vertically, with actors who operate at higher governmental levels being more likely to coordinate the activities of actors at lower levels. In addition, we see evidence of horizontal coordination but only in the confines of the individual state jurisdictions that share the watershed. We see this as a potentially important obstacle to solving the HABs problem in Lake Erie, given that the management of interjurisdictional watersheds is likely to be ineffective in the absence of proper coordination across the different jurisdictions that share the watershed.

J	Bodnar, J; Iglesias, A; Colombi, CE; Drovandi, JM				Bodnar, Josefina; Iglesias, Ari; Colombi, Carina E.; Martin Drovandi, Juan			Stratigraphical, sedimentological and palaeofloristic characterization of the Sorocayense Group (Triassic) in Barreal depocenter, San Juan Province, Argentina	ANDEAN GEOLOGY												The northern area of Cuyo Basin (west-central Argentina) corresponds to the Rincon Blanco half-graben, whose filling is arranged into the Rincon Blanco and Sorocayense groups. In the present study, we propose a new stratigraphic scheme for the Sorocayense Group in the Barreal depocenter (San Juan Province), revise the palaeoenvironmental interpretations, and organize and analyse the plant assemblages of previous and new fossiliferous levels. We defined three tectosedimentary sequences. The basal sequence represents the initial graben filling with pyroclastic flows, alluvial fan, and ephemeral fluvial systems, and is arranged in a new unit, the Cerro Colorado del Cementerio Formation. The middle sequence, including Barreal and Cortaderita formations, is characterized by sediment gravity flow deposits and different fluvial systems, with development of floodplains with vertisols and calcisols, and temporal ponds/lakes. In turn, the Cortaderita Formation was divided into the following lithostratigraphic members: Don Raul and La Emilia. The upper sequence, represented by Cepeda Formation, was deposited by distributary fluvial and ephemeral fluvial systems. Twelve fossiliferous strata (EF) were recognized, which were all identified in the middle sequence: EF1 to EF3 in the Barreal Formation, EF4 to EF8 in the Don Raul Member, and EF9 to EF12 in the La Emilia Member, both of Cortaderita Formation. The taphocoenosis found in the Barreal and Cortaderita formations were dominated by corystosperms, with conifers, cycadales, and peltasperms as subordinate forms. The available evidence from the taphofloras, palaeosols and palaeonvironments indicate the development of seasonal subtropical climates, which vary from arid or semi-arid in the basal sequence, sub-humid to semi-arid in the middle sequence, and arid or semi-arid in the upper sequence. On the basis of the new information, geological correlation and age of the lithostratigraphic units were accurately re-evaluated. Based on the palaeofloristic content and the correlation with the Rincon Blanco Group, it is possible to infer that the basal sequence was accumulated during late Early Triassic-early Middle Triassic, the middle sequence during the Middle Triassic, while the upper sequence was deposited in the early Late Triassic.					; Iglesias, Ari/LDE-5057-2024	Bodnar, Josefina/0000-0001-7707-396X; Iglesias, Ari/0000-0002-9098-8758; 													0718-7106					SEP	2019	46	3					567	603		10.5027/andgeoV46n3-3127	http://dx.doi.org/10.5027/andgeoV46n3-3127													WOS:000492392100006

Assessment of microcystin contamination of Amaranthus hybridus, Brassica oleracea, and Lactuca sativa sold in markets: a case study of Zaria, Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Microcystins (MCs) are toxic secondary metabolites produced by several cyanobacteria genera that have been implicated in human cancer cases and deaths. Human exposure routes include direct contact with contaminated water and the consumption of contaminated food. The present study investigated the presence of MCs in three commonly consumed vegetables at the point of sale in market places as a means of assessing the direct human health risk of buying vegetables. Overall, 53% of the vegetables obtained from different markets had levels of MCs that were higher than 1.00 mu g/g. Amaranthus hybridus L. (smooth amaranth) had the highest MC concentration (4.79 mu g/g) in samples obtained from Sabon Gari Market, while Lactuca sativa L. (garden lettuce) had the lowest concentration (0.17 mu g/g) in samples obtained from Dan-Magaji Market. The highest total daily intake (TDI) of MCs by an adult weighing 60 kg was 3.19 mu g/kg for A. hybridus, 1.41 mu g/kg for Brassica oleracea L. (cabbage), and 2.94 mu g/kg for L. sativa. The highest TDI of MCs for a child weighing 25 kg was highest in A. hybridus (1.91 mu g/kg), followed by L. sativa (1.77 mu g/kg). These results revealed that the consumption of vegetables sold in markets in Zaria, Nigeria, during the dry season represents a major exposure route to MCs. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop policies and monitoring strategies to tackle this problem in developing countries.

Analyzing drivers of fish biomass and biodiversity within community fish refuges in Cambodia	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Freshwater social-ecological systems are shaped by site-specific characteristics, environmental change and annual fluctuations, and the actions of resource users and managers. Our primary aim is to analyze the relative effects of these multifacted forces on fishery productivity and biodiversity using the case of community-managed protected areas within Cambodia's rice field fisheries, known as community fish refuges. Our secondary aim is to take advantage of fixed-effects regression models, a rigorous approach that is common in other disciplines, yet novel to analysis of social-ecological system productivity, and allows comparison of each site to itself across time using observational data. We analyze the relative associations of site characteristics, annual fluctuations, biophysical modifications (e.g., deepening, creation of inlet/outlets, etc.), and governance capacity (i.e., community committee meeting intensity, fundraising to support illegal fishing patrols, etc.) with fish biomass and biodiversity within 40 refuges over three years. We find that seasonal and site-specific effects within this system relate strongly to biomass and species richness patterns. We also find an association between biomass and biodiversity and some elements of governance capacity building. Our findings suggest that in this setting solutions tailored and responsive to the local context may be most appropriate given the strong interannual and site-specific drivers. Methodologically, the dynamism and site specificity of such systems befits within-site comparisons over long time horizons to appreciate the factors that drive biomass and biodiversity.					; Barrett, Christopher/A-9750-2009; Fiorella, Katie/N-9538-2013; Thilsted, Shakuntala/JPU-9977-2023	Thilsted, Shakuntala/0000-0002-4041-1651; Kura, Yumiko/0000-0002-1774-1943; sean, vichet/0009-0007-9881-078X; 													1708-3087					SEP	2019	24	3							18	10.5751/ES-11053-240318	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-11053-240318													WOS:000490942000020

To investigate the cage fish farm as a vector for golden mussel invasion, we hypothesised that: (1) Limnoperna fortunei, a freshwater bivalve mollusc, finds greater food availability in the cage fish farm; (2) the cage fish farm favours mollusc colonisation and its nutritional status; and (3) its performance in the reservoir would vary over the year. We obtained data from limnological variables as well as the number of larvae and adult individuals, to evaluate condition index (CI) monthly from February 2015 to January of 2016. We established sampling stations at three points with fish farming and three points without fish farming (controls) in the Canoas II Reservoir, Paranapanema River, Brazil. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify spatial and temporal distribution of samples according to limnological variables. We performed a linear mixed model analysis to test the hypothesis of no difference between areas (fish farm and control) and time (months) for larval density and CI of L. fortunei. The first PCA axis (28.48% of variance) revealed a temporal gradient, showing the separation between cold and hot months. The second PCA axis (19.61% of variance) separated the samples of control and fish farms; fish farms displayed higher concentrations of total phosphorus, nitrite, and chlorophyll a. Larval densities of L. fortunei were higher in fish cage areas with time being responsible for 35% of this variation. Mussel CI was also higher in fish farms and time was responsible for 36% of the variation. We conclude that fish production in cages contributes to the establishment of golden mussels in the reservoir. Our results serve as a warning that other molluscs or invasive species may be favoured by aquaculture activities in aquatic environments. The colonisation of the mussel in the reservoir varies during the year in response to seasonality.

They undergo seasonal changes resulting in an array of temperature and oxygen conditions; oxic-low, oxic-high, anoxic-low, and anoxic-high temperature. We sought to understand the interaction of temperature and oxygen conditions on benthic solutes exchange through a two-factorial sediment core incubation experiment by varying either temperature or oxygen conditions of sediment cores from an oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir. Temperature and oxygen conditions are both important for nutrient release; however, they influence solutes differently; differences in the fluxes of the treatments were explained more by temperature for P, DOC and N, while for Fe, Mn and SO42-, differences were explained more by oxygen conditions. The combination of strongly reducing conditions (due to anoxia) and high temperature (20 degrees C) led to a significant increase in nutrients concentrations in the overlying water. Under these conditions, SRP flux was 0.04 and 0.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1); ammonium was 0.9 and 5.6 mmol M-2 d(-1) for the oligotrophic and eutrophic reservoir, respectively. We observed a synergistic interaction between temperature and oxygen conditions which resulted in release of solutes from sediments. An increase in nutrients release under increasing temperatures is more likely and so are algal blooms.					; Dadi, Tallent/AAR-1073-2021; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Friese, Kurt/E-1395-2012	Dadi, Tallent/0000-0002-0605-3707; Friese, Kurt/0000-0002-7769-0818														2073-4441				APR	2020	12	4							1065	10.3390/w12041065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12041065													WOS:000539527500142

Different Spectral Domain Transformation for Land Cover Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks with Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												This study compares some different types of spectral domain transformations for convolutional neural network (CNN)-based land cover classification. A novel approach was proposed, which transforms one-dimensional (1-D) spectral vectors into two-dimensional (2-D) features: Polygon graph images (CNN-Polygon) and 2-D matrices (CNN-Matrix). The motivations of this study are that (1) the shape of the converted 2-D images is more intuitive for human eyes to interpret when compared to 1-D spectral input; and (2) CNNs are highly specialized and may be able to similarly utilize this information for land cover classification. Four seasonal Landsat 8 images over three study areas-Lake Tapps, Washington, Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and Gwangju, Korea-were used to evaluate the proposed approach for nine land cover classes compared to several other methods: Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), 1-D CNN, and patch-based CNN. Oversampling and undersampling approaches were conducted to examine the effect of the sample size on the model performance. The CNN-Polygon had better performance than the other methods, with overall accuracies of about 93%-95 % for both Concord and Lake Tapps and 80%-84% for Gwangju. The CNN-Polygon particularly performed well when the training sample size was small, less than 200 per class, while the CNN-Matrix resulted in similar or higher performance as sample sizes became larger. The contributing input variables to the models were carefully analyzed through sensitivity analysis based on occlusion maps and accuracy decreases. Our result showed that a more visually intuitive representation of input features for CNN-based classification models yielded higher performance, especially when the training sample size was small. This implies that the proposed graph-based CNNs would be useful for land cover classification where reference data are limited.

Poyang Lake is of great importance for maintaining regional ecological balance; however, algal blooms have become major environmental problems in this basin, and they are also caused by a variety of problems including biodiversity decline, toxin production and possibly unsafe drinking water. In this study, the community structure of phytoplankton and physicochemical parameters were investigated in different eutrophication area, Poyang Lake Basin. The results showed that the number of phytoplankton species had decreased, but the density and biomass were increased in the current period. The assemblage structure of phytoplankton showed significantly seasonal and spatial variability. The assemblage structure of phytoplankton was related to dissolved oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, chlorophyll-a and ammonium nitrogen, based on redundancy analysis. The study showed that the phytoplankton community structure was influenced by algal blooms and water quality factors. This study provides an important reference for increased biomonitoring and ecohydrological studies in this basin.

In this paper, the feasibility of implementing SGE in hypersaline coastal lagoons is addressed, taking the coastal lagoon La Carbonera in Yucatan, Mexico, as an exemplary case. A realistic approach to the exploitation conditions and potential that could occur in a SGE plant in these ecosystems is presented. We first analyzed the variability of salinity and temperature in the three characteristic zones of the coastal lagoon and the correlation of these variables with atmospheric forcing. This was done using 1 year records of in situ measurements. Then the theoretical potential for SGE and the intra-annual variability of that potential were assessed considering the three possible harvesting configurations of mixing among fresh, sea, and hypersaline water. Results show that the thermohaline structure may vary significantly for the three locations at different time scales (diurnal to seasonal) depending on the tides, winds, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. That suggests that the highest annual energy yield would be obtained from alternating throughout the year among the mixing configurations, depending on the specific seasonal thermohaline structure of the lagoon.

Mapping Kenyan Grassland Heights Across Large Spatial Scales with Combined Optical and Radar Satellite Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Grassland monitoring can be challenging because it is time-consuming and expensive to measure grass condition at large spatial scales. Remote sensing offers a time- and cost-effective method for mapping and monitoring grassland condition at both large spatial extents and fine temporal resolutions. Combinations of remotely sensed optical and radar imagery are particularly promising because together they can measure differences in moisture, structure, and reflectance among land cover types. We combined multi-date radar (PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) imagery with field data and visual interpretation of aerial imagery to classify land cover in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya using machine learning (Random Forests). This study area comprises a diverse array of land cover types and changes over time due to seasonal changes in precipitation, seasonal movements of large herds of resident and migratory ungulates, fires, and livestock grazing. We classified twelve land cover types with user's and producer's accuracies ranging from 66%-100% and an overall accuracy of 86%. These methods were able to distinguish among short, medium, and tall grass cover at user's accuracies of 83%, 82%, and 85%, respectively. By yielding a highly accurate, fine-resolution map that distinguishes among grasses of different heights, this work not only outlines a viable method for future grassland mapping efforts but also will help inform local management decisions and research in the Masai Mara National Reserve.					; Holekamp, Kay/G-6054-2010; Spagnuolo, Olivia/ITW-1088-2023	Miller, Mary Ellen/0000-0002-0294-3665; Battaglia, Michael J./0009-0007-5570-6528; 														2072-4292				APR	2020	12	7							1086	10.3390/rs12071086	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12071086													WOS:000537709600036

We focused on seven environmental factors each represented by one or multiple environmental variables and seven fish functional traits each represented by two or more classes. Multivariate direct gradient analyses suggested that riparian zone landcover can be considered a higher level causal factor in a network of relations that control instream characteristics and fish assemblages. Our results provide a framework for a hierarchical conceptual model that identifies singular and collective influences of variables from different scales on each other and ultimately on different aspects related to stream fish functional composition. This conceptual model is focused on the relationships between riparian landcover and instream variables as causal factors on the organisation of stream fish assemblages. Our results can also be viewed as a model for headwater stream management in that landcover can be manipulated to influence factors such as bank composition, substrates and water quality, whereas fish assemblage composition can be used as indicators to monitor the success of such efforts.					; Miranda, Luísa/N-6353-2013	Miranda, Leandro/0000-0002-2138-7924; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2013	22	4					607	616		10.1111/eff.12065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12065													WOS:000327783200011
J	Jin, ZD; You, CF; Wang, Y; Shi, YW				Jin, Zhangdong; You, Chen-Feng; Wang, Yi; Shi, Yuewei			Hydrological and solute budgets of Lake Qinghai, the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Water level and chemistry of Lake Qinghai are sensitive to climate changes and are important for paleoclimatic implications. An accurate understanding of hydrological and chemical budgets is crucial for quantifying geochemical proxies and carbon cycle. Published results of water budget are firstly reviewed in this paper. Chemical budget and residence time of major dissolved constituents in the lake are estimated using reliable water budget and newly obtained data for seasonal water chemistry. The results indicate that carbonate weathering is the most important riverine process, resulting in dominance of Ca(2+) and DIC for river waters and groundwater. Groundwater contribution to major dissolved constituents is relatively small (4.2 +/- 0.5%). Wet atmospheric deposition contributes annually 7.4-44.0% soluble flux to the lake, resulting from eolian dust throughout the seasons. Estimates of chemical budget further suggest that (1) the Buha-type water dominates the chemical components of the lake water, (2) Na(+), Cl(-), Mg(2+), and K(+) in lake water are enriched owing to their conservative behaviors, and (3) precipitation of authigenic carbonates (low-Mg calcite, aragonite, and dolomite) transits quickly dissolved Ca(2+) into the bottom sediments of the lake, resulting in very low Ca(2+) in the lake water. Therefore, authigenic carbonates in the sediments hold potential information on the relative contribution of different solute inputs to the lake and the lake chemistry in the past.

J	Yin, YX; Chen, Y; Yu, ST; Xu, WC; Wang, W; Xu, YP				Yin, Yixing; Chen, Ying; Yu, Shutong; Xu, Wucheng; Wang, Wen; Xu, Youpeng			Maximum water level of Hongze Lake and its relationship with natural changes and human activities from 1736 to 2005	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Hongze Lake is the fourth largest freshwater lake in China. The water level of Hongze Lake has changed significantly in the past centuries, and the maximum water level (MWL) is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. This paper explores the changes and driving factors (including natural changes and human activities) of Hongze Lake water level, using the annual MWL data from both historical documents and gauged records, and investigates the relationship between the Hongze Lake MWL and the flood/drought disasters of the Huai River basin, Meiyu length, and human activities. The results shows that during the 1736-1953 period, river changes, such as the Yellow River's capture of the Huai River, contributed substantially to the changes of Hongze Lake water level. The MWL correlated also well with climate changes (e.g. flood/drought changes, Meiyu length) during this period. During 1954-2005, the flood/drought series in the Huai River basin is consistent with the flood season/annual precipitation, but the annual MWL of Hongze Lake is not. This is because a large number of hydraulic projects have been constructed around the Hongze lake during this period, and thus the MWL is greatly influenced by artificial regulations since the 1950s. The paper comes to the conclusion that the changes of the MWL were mainly driven by natural changes before the 1950s. Anthropogenic activities (especially hydraulic engineering) have played a more and more important role in the MWL changes in the past 50 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Environmental Monitoring of Heavy-Metals Status and Human Health Risk Assessment in the Soil of Sahl El-Hessania Area, Egypt	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Sahl El-Hussainia is an important reclamation project in Egypt located on El-Salam channel. Soils of these areas are irrigated with drainage water mixed with Nile water at a ratio of 1:1. North of Sahl El-Hussinia there exists Lake Manzalla, which receives large quantities of domestic, industrial, and agricultural discharges. The current study was aimed at measuring the contamination level of Sahl El-Hussainia soils with heavy metals and their effects on the grown plant contents of these contaminants. In addition, human risks resulting due to exposure to these heavy metals through different exposure routes were evaluated. To achieve these goals, soil and rice plant samples were collected from Khalid Ibn El-Waleed village, SahlEI-Hussainia, and analyzed for their contents of trace elements, i.e. Pb, Cd, Co, Ni, As, and Se. The results reveal that the soil of study suffers from moderate contamination with Pb, Co, Ni, and As to severe contamination with Cd and Se. Moreover, As and Pb were found at high concentrations in rice grains exceeding the permissible ones. The expected health risk assessments indicate that As, Se, and Pb can possess a health threat for children, whereas only As and Se can posses health problem for adults. Arsenic was found to contribute to more magnitude of cancer risks. Finally, bad management of Sahl El-Hussainia resulted in contamination of soil with trace elements. Accordingly, food obtained from the area of study might not be suitable for human consumption.

Heavy metals in plants in constructed and natural wetlands: concentration, accumulation and seasonality	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The accumulation of heavy metals in plants is a function of uptake capacity and intracellular binding sites. The concentrations of heavy metals in plants growing in constructed wetlands vary considerably between species and systems but in general, the concentrations are within the range commonly found in natural stands. The highest concentrations are mostly found in roots, followed by rhizomes, leaves and stems. Unfortunately, concentration values are commonly used to evaluate the 'accumulation' of heavy metals, but this approach is not correct. In order to evaluate heavy metal accumulation, the biomass of particular plant parts must be taken into consideration. In addition, there are two other factors, which need to be taken into consideration when accumulation is evaluated, namely seasonality and distribution within the plant shoot. It has been found that the seasonal distribution of heavy metals in the biomass varies between heavy metals and mostly does not follow the pattern known for nutrients. In addition, the concentration and accumulation of heavy metals vary considerably within the shoot and this fact should be taken into consideration when analyses are carried out.

Till stratigraphy and sedimentology at the margins of terrestrially terminating ice streams: case study of the western Canadian prairies and high plains	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Complex glacigenic sediment sequences arranged in large arcuate assemblages and demarcating the lobate termini of fast ice flow corridors in western Canada represent the terrestrial equivalents of the trough-mouth fans of the marine palaeo-ice stream record. Intensive sedimentological and stratigraphic investigations at a regional scale are employed in the interpretation of thick units or sequences of diamicton and two depositional scenarios are proposed. First, glacier-marginal till thickening and the stacking of till wedges takes place in areas where an ice stream margin was stationary for short periods of time. Stacks of subglacial traction tills potentially record annual sub-marginal incremental thickening at ice stream margins especially in areas where densely spaced recessional push moraines appear to record seasonal climatic forcing. Second, proglacial lake and valley infilling with glacilacustrine rhythmites and mass flow diamictons is associated with the advection of sub-marginal till into preglacial bedrock depressions and records ice stream marginal oscillations and debris influx into discontinuous proglacial lakes, which act as subaqueous sediment sinks for materials that would otherwise have been used to construct sub-marginal till wedges and moraines. Glacial overriding modifies the deposits produced in both scenarios through deformation and the dislocation and entrainment of bedrock and sediment rafts at the margins of bedrock valley walls, resulting in the widespread development of glacitectonites and megablocks. The occurrence of the thickest deposits as preglacial valley fills may be significant in groundwater siphoning away from subglacial deforming layers and the promotion of sticky spots.

Estimating ice phenology on large northern lakes from AMSR-E: algorithm development and application to Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, Canada	CRYOSPHERE												Time series of brightness temperatures (T-B) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) are examined to determine ice phenology variables on the two largest lakes of northern Canada: Great Bear Lake (GBL) and Great Slave Lake (GSL). T-B measurements from the 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz channels (H- and V- polarization) are compared to assess their potential for detecting freeze-onset/melt-onset and ice-on/ice-off dates on both lakes. The 18.7 GHz (H-pol) channel is found to be the most suitable for estimating these ice dates as well as the duration of the ice cover and ice-free seasons. A new algorithm is proposed using this channel and applied to map all ice phenology variables on GBL and GSL over seven ice seasons (2002-2009). Analysis of the spatio-temporal patterns of each variable at the pixel level reveals that: (1) both freeze-onset and ice-on dates occur on average about one week earlier on GBL than on GSL (Day of Year (DY) 318 and 333 for GBL; DY 328 and 343 for GSL); (2) the freeze-up process or freeze duration (freeze-onset to ice-on) takes a slightly longer amount of time on GBL than on GSL (about 1 week on average); (3) melt-onset and ice-off dates occur on average one week and approximately four weeks later, respectively, on GBL (DY 143 and 183 for GBL; DY 135 and 157 for GSL); (4) the break-up process or melt duration (melt-onset to ice-off) lasts on average about three weeks longer on GBL; and (5) ice cover duration estimated from each individual pixel is on average about three weeks longer on GBL compared to its more southern counterpart, GSL. A comparison of dates for several ice phenology variables derived from other satellite remote sensing products (e.g. NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), QuikSCAT, and Canadian Ice Service Database) show that, despite its relatively coarse spatial resolution, AMSR-E 18.7 GHz provides a viable means for monitoring of ice phenology on large northern lakes.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2012	6	2					235	254		10.5194/tc-6-235-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-6-235-2012													WOS:000304062100001

Onset of calving at supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers of the Nepal Himalaya	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Field surveys of supraglacial ponds on debris-covered glaciers in the Nepal Himalaya clarify that ice-cliff calving occurs when the fetch exceeds similar to 80m. Thermal undercutting is important for calving processes in glacial lakes, and subaqueous ice melt rates during the melt and freeze seasons are therefore estimated under simple geomorphologic conditions. In particular, we focus on the differences between valley wind-driven water currents in various fetches during the melt season. Our results demonstrate that the subaqueous ice melt rate exceeds the ice-cliff melt rate when the fetch is >20 m and water temperature is 2-4 degrees C. Calculations suggest the onset of calving due to thermal undercutting is controlled by water currents driven by winds at the surface of the lake, which develop with expanding water surface.

J	Zhang, ZY; Huang, JH; Huang, YL; Hong, HS				Zhang, Zhenyu; Huang, Jinhang; Huang, Yaling; Hong, Huasheng			Streamflow variability response to climate change and cascade dams development in a coastal China watershed	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal watersheds and their changes in streamflow have become a particular concern in hydrology and water resource management. The ecohydrologic analysis and environmental flow component were coupled in this study to assess the streamflow variability response to climate change and human activities in the Jiulong River Watershed (JRW). Results showed that human activities were the main contributing factors to decreasing streamflow in the JRW. Available water resources decreased by 4.34% and 3.17% in the North River and West River, respectively. In addition to climate change, watershed characteristics partly influenced the streamflow quantity and regime in the North River and West River. The cascade dam construction along the mainstream of the JRW, which made the water bodies from free-flowing rivers to cascade lakes, altered the patterns of streamflow regime in terms of low and high flow events, as well as the flood pattern. The monthly low flow increased in almost all seasons; the high flow pulses homogenized; and little variation in the flood pattern was detected within the JRW. We present a case study in a southeast coastal watershed to illustrate a combined approach that could facilitate to evaluate the streamflow variability in terms of streamflow quantity and regime response to climate change and cascade dams development in two adjacent rivers within the JRW, which could hopefully provide water managers on the strategies to fight the effect of environmental changes on watershed ecosystem.

Seasonal and spatial variability of CO2 emission from a large floodplain lake in the lower Amazon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The inundation status of the Amazon floodplain affects biogenic gas production and evasion. We analyzed spatial variability of dissolved CO2 concentration and gas evasion in a large floodplain lake in the lower reach of the Amazon River in four hydrological phases. We calculated surficial CO2 concentrations from measurements of pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, temperature, and conductivity and used meteorological data to calculate gas transfer coefficients to estimate CO2 evasion. Gas transfer coefficients that take into account both wind and heating and cooling at the lake's surface are on the order of 10 cm hr(-1), approximately four times higher than values previously used in regional estimates of gas evasion from lakes on the Amazon floodplain. Supersaturation of CO2 occurred throughout the lake and was higher in the littoral zone and in regions receiving Amazon River inflows. CO2 concentration was reduced in regions with phytoplankton blooms. The range of CO2 concentrations was least at low water, 47 mu M to 233 mu M, and largest at high water, 1 mu M to 656 mu M; the average annual value was 125 mu M. We estimate mean (+/- standard deviation) fluxes from open-water in L. Curuai to the atmosphere of 44 +/- 15, 348 +/- 13, 371 +/- 23, and 364 +/- 20 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) during receding, low, rising, and high water, respectively. The error associated with these values reflects, for each hydrological phase, the spatial variation in CO2 concentration in L. Curuai, a likely range in atmospheric CO2 levels and temporal variations in gas transfer coefficient within 10-day periods.

Manganese redox buffering limits arsenic release from contaminated sediments, Union Lake, New Jersey	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The sediments of Union Lake in Southern New Jersey are contaminated with arsenic released from the Vineland Chemical Company Superfund site 11 km upstream. Seasonal anoxia has been shown to release arsenic from sediments to similar lakes; this process was hypothesized as a major arsenic source to Union Lake. Data indicate, however, that releases of arsenic to bottom waters from the sediments or from pore waters within the sediments are relatively minor: bottom water arsenic concentrations reached-30 ppb (similar to 12 mu M) at most, representing < 13% of the dissolved arsenic content of the lake. Manganese concentrations increase more quickly and to higher levels than arsenic and iron concentrations; maximum [Mn] = similar to 13 ppm (similar to 250 mu M), maximum [Fe] = similar to 6 ppm (similar to 120 mu M). Incubation experiments support the hypothesis that manganese acts as a redox buffer and prevents large arsenic releases. Under the observed conditions, little of the arsenic in the water column is from contaminated bottom sediments. This study also suggests that arsenic release from sediment to lake water may be more important in lakes that remain anoxic more continuously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in modern and fossil species assemblages of Lago Peten Itza were used as indicators of changes in the balance between evaporation and precipitation, past lake level and carbon source. Ostracode taphonomy was used to detect past periods of strong currents, high-energy environments, and possible partial or full mixing of the lake. The modern lake water isotopic composition displays clear seasonal differences that are independent of lake level fluctuations. Modern benthic species displayed lower delta O-18 and delta C-13 values than nektobenthic species, with differences of 3.0 parts per thousand and 5.3 parts per thousand, respectively. Valves of nektobenthic species display higher values of delta C-13 because these ostracodes live in shallower environments among abundant algae and aquatic plants, where productivity is high. The benthic species Limnocythere opesta Brehm, 1939 displayed the smallest average offset from delta O-18 water (+0.3 parts per thousand) and the largest offset from delta C-13(DIC) values (-4.1 parts per thousand) among studied ostracode species. Nektobenthic species Heterocypris punctata Keyser, 1975 displayed the smallest difference relative to the delta C-13(DIC) values (-0.1 parts per thousand). Late Pleistocene-early Holocene climate conditions and water levels in Lago Peten Itza can be summarized as follows: 1) high lake levels and cold conditions (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM], similar to 24-19 ka), 2) fluctuating lake levels and cold conditions (Heinrich Stadial 1 [HS1], similar to 19-15 ka), 3) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (Bolling-Allerod [BA], similar to 15-13 ka), 4) low lake levels and dry conditions (Younger Dryas [YD], similar to 13-11.5 ka) and 5) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (early Holocene, similar to 11.5-10.0 ka). Average lake level fluctuation in Lago Peten Itza during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene was as much as similar to 25 m. Ostracode analyses suggest that the LGM was characterized by relatively low delta O-18 (+4.7 to +6.0 parts per thousand), and delta C-13 values (-7.1 to -6.4 parts per thousand) in ostracode valves, high inferred water depths and high percentages of broken adult and juvenile valves (>66%), suggesting a high-energy environment, strong currents, partial to full mixing, downslope transport, colder water temperatures and wetter conditions. An increase in the relative abundance of the benthic species L. opesta and higher numbers of broken valves suggest heavy precipitation events during the LGM (similar to 23.7, 21.7, 20.8 and 20.1 ka). HS1 was predominantly dry, but we identified times when lake levels were slightly higher, at the onset of the deglacial and a brief period (similar to 17-16 ka) between HS1b and HS1a. All studied climate proxies indicate wetter and warmer conditions and lake system stability during the BA. Lake levels dropped during the YD and gradually increased during the Preboreal and early Holocene. We demonstrate that modern and fossil ostracode isotopic signatures, species assemblages and taphonomy can be used together with physical and geochemical variables in Lago Peten Itza sediments to make high-resolution inferences about late Pleistocene-early Holocene environmental changes in the lowland Neotropics.

Hg concentrations in lake trout and burbot increased significantly over the early 1990s to 2012 in the two major regions of the lake; no trend was evident for northern pike over 1999-2012. Temporal variations in Hg concentrations in lake trout and burbot were similar with respect to timing of peaks and troughs. Inclusion of climate variables based on annual means, particularly temperature, improved explanatory power for variations in Hg over analyses based only on year and fish length; unexpectedly, the temperature coefficient was negative. Climate analyses based on growing season means (defined as May September) had less explanatory power suggesting that trends were more strongly associated with colder months within the year. Inclusion of the Pacific/North American index improved explanatory power for the lake trout model suggesting that trends may have been affected by air circulation patterns. Overall, while our study confirmed previously reported trends of Hg increase in burbot in the MRB, we found no evidence that these trends were directly driven by increasing temperatures and productivity.

Poyang Lake is the largest lake in China, but its habitat has been seriously degraded because of human activities and natural factors (e.g. climate change), resulting in a decline in freshwater biodiversity. Zooplankton are useful indicators of environmental stressors because they are sensitive to external perturbations. DNA metabarcoding is an approach that has gained significant traction by aiding ecosystem conservation and management. Here, the seasonal and spatial variability in the zooplankton diversity were analyzed in the Poyang Lake Basin using DNA metabarcoding. The results showed that the community structure of zooplankton exhibited significant seasonal and spatial variability using DNA metabarcoding, where the community structure was correlated with turbidity, water temperature, pH, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. These results indicated habitat variations affected by human activities and seasonal change could be the main driving factors for the variations of zooplankton community. This study also provides an important reference for the management of aquatic ecosystem health and conservation of aquatic biodiversity.					xuemei, qiu/HNB-5101-2023														2045-7758					JUL	2022	12	6							e8972	10.1002/ece3.8972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8972								35784091					WOS:000806157000001

In this contribution, spatial and seasonal distribution of dissolved boron of the Chilika lagoon, India (Asia's largest brackish-water lagoon) and its possible source waters have been investigated to constrain its coastal behavior and chemical budget. Further, oxygen isotopic analyses of selected samples were carried out to quantify the evaporation process. The boron concentrations show significant spatial variations (0.6-246 mu mol/kg; for monsoon (Aug., 2017) season), with the lower values being observed in the river-dominated northern sector of the lagoon. The area-weighted boron concentration of the Chilika during monsoon (128 mu mol/kg) is found intermediate to that of the riverine (1.7 +/- 0.8 mu mol/kg), groundwater (25 +/- 38 mu mol/kg) and oceanic (406 +/- 13 mu mol/kg) water sources. In contrast to boron, the average delta O-18 value (2.2 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) for the lagoon samples is significantly enriched than their source waters. Calculations based on the delta O-18 and salinity data estimate about 40% loss of surface water via evaporation. Co-variation between boron and salinity of the samples establishes conservative behavior during onset of the monsoon (June) and also, in the monsoon (Aug) seasons. The boron-salinity trend and boron/salinity ratios of pre-monsoon (May) samples, however, point to its non-conservative behavior with significant boron removal at low-saline regime through ion-exchange (adsorption) processes. Removal of boron is mostly limited to salinity < 15 psu and the intensity (in %) of removal increases steadily with decrease in salinity. These adsorptive losses of boron during pre-monsoon period are mostly dependent on the water residence time; higher residence time allows efficient particulate-water interaction, which possibly intensifies the removal. Further, the boron concentrations show significant changes on diurnal and fortnightly timescales due to tide/ebb cycles. However, the coastal behavior of boron, despite of large concentration changes, remains invariant due to tidal forcing. Outcomes of this study underscore adsorptive removal of boron from coastal regimes and its importance in understanding authigenic boron distribution in clay-rich sedimentary archives from nearshore settings.					; Prakash, Satya/HNS-9397-2023	Tripathy, Gyana/0000-0002-3606-6226; 													0304-4203	1872-7581				AUG 20	2019	214								103663	10.1016/j.marchem.2019.103663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2019.103663													WOS:000477687000001

The measurements enabled the characterization of the seasonal and interannual variability of the energy and water fluxes of the ecosystem covering two wet years (2012 and 2013) and one drought year (2014). On an annual scale, more than 60% of net radiation (Rn) was partitioned as latent (LE) and sensible (H) energy flux, with the latter being the larger consumer of Rn (similar to 34%) and dominant for most months. The transition from H to LE dominance occurred from early noon to late afternoon in the wettest months of April and May. The residual energy balance closure term (C) accounted for between 25 and 40% of the Rn with the imbalance tending to be highest during periods of high insolation. Annual evapotranspiration was estimated at 873 mm, 632mm and 537mm for year 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. This accounted for at least 80% of the annual precipitation received for the respective years. Surface conductance (g(s)) scaled significantly with leaf expansion and Priestley-Taylor alpha coefficient, but was limited during periods of drought because of inadequate soil moisture suggesting that, change in LE was paralleled by changes in green leaf area index. Low values of decoupling coefficient (Omega) during these periods indicated that evapotranspiration was strongly controlled by g(s) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, under non-limiting moisture conditions evapotranspiration was decoupled from the atmosphere. This suggested that during the dry seasons and periods of prolonged drought, a lack of moisture in combination with high VPD leads to significant decreases in stomatal conductance that eventually limits partitioning of available energy into LE in the semi-arid ecosystem part of the Lake Naivasha basin. However, during wet season these factors are non-limiting and radiation is the dominant control of energy partitioning into LE in the ecosystem. The coupling and decoupling pattern provide insights towards formulating models that quantify evapotranspiration for ecosystems that experience seasonal shifts in controlling factors.

Viability of Seeds Consumed by Fishes in a Lowland Forest in the Brazilian Central Amazon	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Varzeas are forest areas seasonally flooded by white-water rivers and have a variety of tree species, which bear fruit during the filling or flood and in the beginning of low water periods. During those periods of inundation, fruits and seeds are important resources for different fish species. In this study, the viability of whole seeds removed from the stomach and intestine of fishes was analyzed. Fishes were collected with gillnets installed during 24-hr cycles along the flooded forest, during the filling, flood, and in the beginning of low water periods of the Year 2014 in the Catalao lake, Brazilian Central Amazon. In total, 1,915 specimens of fish were captured, and 148 specimens (8% from the total) contained seeds in their digestive tracts. Some fishes that consumed seeds are species commercially important and have migratory habits. Fishes consumed 3,092 seeds. All whole seeds removed from the digestive tracts of fishes were seeded in varzea soil and maintained in a greenhouse. Seeds of 16 plant species (89%) germinated. Our conclusion is that fish species can play an important role in the ecology of varzea forests by dispersing seeds, contributing to the colonization of new areas, and allowing genetic flow between subpopulations distributed along the rivers.

Patterns and controls of seasonal variability of carbon stable isotopes of particulate organic matter in lakes	OECOLOGIA												Carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of particulate organic matter (POM) have been used as indicators for energy flow, primary productivity and carbon dioxide concentration in individual lakes. Here, we provide a synthesis of literature data from 32 freshwater lakes around the world to assess the variability of delta C-13(POM) along latitudinal, morphometric and biogeochemical gradients. Seasonal mean delta C-13(POM), a temporally integrated measure of the delta C-13(POM), displayed weak relationships with all trophic state indices [total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll a (Chl a)], but decreased significantly with the increase in latitude, presumably in response to the corresponding decrease in water temperature and increase in CO2 concentration. The seasonal minimum delta C-13(POM) also correlated negatively with latitude while seasonal maximum delta C-13(POM) correlated positively with all trophic state indices, pH, and delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Seasonal amplitude of delta C-13(POM) (the difference between seasonal maximum and minimum values) correlated significantly with pH, TP and Chl a concentrations and displayed small variations in oligotrophic, mesotrophic and low latitude eutrophic lakes, which is attributed to low primary productivity and abundant non-living POM in the low trophic state lakes and relatively stable environmental conditions in the subtropics. Seasonal amplitude of delta C-13(POM) was the greatest in high latitude eutrophic lakes. Greater seasonal changes in solar energy and light regime may be responsible for the large seasonal variability in high latitude productive lakes. This synthesis provides new insights on the factors controlling variations in stable carbon isotopes of POM among lakes on the global scale.

Recently, Dongting Lake has experienced phenomena such as an early dry season and backflow during the flood season. Multi-source remote sensing data and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) threshold method were used to systematically analyse the water area of the lake from 2005 to 2020. Additionally, it employed a centre of gravity migration model and a geographic detector model to investigate the lake's evolution patterns and driving mechanisms. The research identified notable fluctuations in Dongting Lake's water area during this period, with a particularly sharp decline in 2006-from 1509.74 km2 to 815 km2, marking a decrease of 694.74 km2 and a shrinkage rate of 46.01 %. Spatial analysis indicated that the centre of gravity of these water areas changed primarily between Nandashan Town, the Dongting Lake Management Committee, Wanzihu Township, and Qingtan Township, underscoring their significant influence on lake dynamics, including runoff, surface water availability, sediment deposition, and precipitation, all of which displayed strong positive correlations (Pearson coefficients of 0.57, 0.68, and 0.63, respectively), whereas population density showed a negative correlation (Pearson coefficient of -0.56). Furthermore, the study highlighted the substantial impact of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and its interaction with slope and aspect on Dongting Lake's evolution, with Q values of 0.537 and 0.543, respectively, emphasising their critical roles in shaping lake area changes and providing a crucial scientific basis for enhancing the understanding and effective management of water resources in the Dongting Lake Basin through comprehensive analysis of its spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms.

Basketry, cordage, and perishable artifact manufacture at Bonneville Estates Rockshelter: Diachronic technological variation	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												As a technologically-complex material class, perishable artifacts have the potential to address a multitude of socio-economic activities and behaviors; however, their application to these subjects are limited by poor preservation and small sample sizes. This study presents a novel approach to analysis that incorporates the chaine ope ' ratoire of basketry and cordage, demonstrating the efficacy of applying statistics to characterize technological organization. To illustrate the utility of this approach, this study provides a diachronic analysis of basketry, cordage, and related manufacturing waste from Bonneville Estates Rockshelter (BER), a multi-layered "dry cave" archaeological site in the eastern Great Basin dating from the late Pleistocene through the Holocene. The relationship between people and the environment as well as social interaction among hunter-gatherers are addressed by considering the timing, changes, and seasonality of perishables at BER. Changes in basketry manufacture and the importance of net hunting throughout the Holocene emphasize temporal variation in community participation in subsistence activities. Debris from textile production demonstrates that BER also functioned as a multi seasonal manufacturing and repair site. By comparing functional and technological-stylistic attributes, this study characterizes the complex ways gender influenced the manufacture and use of a material class traditionally associated with feminine work in hunter-gatherer communities.																			0278-4165	1090-2686				DEC	2021	64								101325	10.1016/j.jaa.2021.101325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2021.101325		AUG 2021											WOS:000701798600002

Here we investigated climate warming induced ecological changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) over the past 50 years on the basis of a large amount of in situ field observation and remote sensing data. We found that climate warming up to 0.41 degrees C/10 a has greatly improved the heat conditions on the TP, thus exhibits a growth of 46,000 ha farmland during the past 30 years, with the largest growth rate by 19% which occurred above 4000 m. Terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) has increased by 0.002 Pg C a(-1). Broad-leaved forest had the highest average NPP. Cultivated vegetation contributes most for causing NPP growth in the recent 30 years. We also found that seasonal frozen soil depth decreased as the consequence of climate warming. Increased snow-melting inflated lake and river areas, whereas swamp area decreased owing to reduced moisture in the root zone. Freeze-thawing erosion decreased because of the reduced annual range of temperature. Understanding the ecological effects of climate change on the TP is of great significance to improve environmental management and promote sustainable development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Location Lake Bambili, western Cameroon (05 degrees 56' N, 10 degrees 14' E, 2273 m a.s.l.). Methods Fossil pollen was extracted from a long, continuous and well-dated sedimentary sequence extending back 20,000 years. Pollen diversity and evenness estimates were based on rarefaction analysis and on Simpson's (1/D) index. Results Forest was nearly absent from high elevations during the last glacial period. It expanded gradually from 18.4 cal. kyr bp, interrupted only by reversals coincident with the Heinrich 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) climatic events, and then suddenly collapsed at 3.3 cal. kyr bp. This switch from forest to grassland communities occurred within a time span of three centuries. After 3.3 cal. kyr bp only short and taxon-poor forest phases are recorded, specifically between 2.7 and 1 cal. kyr bp and in recent centuries. Main conclusions Our data indicate that the mountain forests of Cameroon are recent, resulting from plant migrations from various sources from 18.4 cal. kyr bp onwards. Their progressive development closely followed intensification of the Atlantic monsoon, leading to the formation of a dense forest between 11.7 and 3.3 cal. kyr bp. The composition of this forest included the co-occurrence of species whose ranges do not overlap today, and indicates the potential for the development of unique iterations of climax forests through time. These forests appear to be very sensitive to Northern Hemisphere climate change, with phases of expansion/contraction coeval with the boreal deglacial signal, including widely recognized events such as H1, the YD and the 8.2 ka event. From 8.2 cal. kyr bp onwards, the progressive opening of the canopy is likely to reflect increased seasonality in rainfall related to more frequent El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The final step of this history was the collapse of the montane forest at 3.3 cal. kyr bp. During the last millennium, very severe disruptions have meant that only the most rapidly dispersing species could spread, contributing to a drastic loss of forest biodiversity that has been accentuated by human impact in the last few centuries.					; Lézine, Anne-Marie/A-5618-2013	LEZINE, Anne-Marie/0000-0002-3555-5124; 													0305-0270	1365-2699				JAN	2013	40	1					183	196		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02770.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02770.x													WOS:000312646800015

The rational of this study is to identify the best performing GCMs for projection of future climate as well as for using those models for climate adaptation and mitigation plans in the study area. Through wide-ranging evaluation methods using the Comprehensive Rating Index (CRI) and Taylor diagram, our study contributes by highlighting the top performing GCMs across different temporal scales for precipitation, Tmax and Tmin separately. The findings indicated that EC-Earth3, MPI-ESM1-2-LR and ACCESS-ESM1-5 at daily time scale, and CNRMCM6-1, BCC-CSM2-MR and EC-Earth3 at monthly timescale are the best performing models for simulating precipitation. The best performing models for simulating MAM (March-May) seasonal precipitation are BCC-CSM2-MR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, EC-Earth3 while ACCESS-ESM1-5, MPI-ESM12-LR, and EC-Earth3 are good at for JJAS (June-September) precipitation. BCC-CSM2-MR, MPIESM1-2-LR, EC-Earth3 and ACCESS-ESM1-5 are best performing models for simulating annual rainfall. Conversely, MIROC6 exhibits relatively weaker performance for simulating rainfall across all the studied temporal scales. For Tmax, EC-Earth3, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, and MRI-ESM20 consistently performed well, while BCC-CSM2-MR is the poorly performing climate model. Regarding Tmin, EC-Earth3, BCC-CSM2-MR and MPI-ESM1-2-LR consistently perform well, while MIROC6 demonstrates weaker performance. The finding suggested that one of the best performing CMIP6 models for simulating precipitation (ACCESS-ESM1-5) did not equally perform well for representing Tmax and Tmin. In addition, the best performing model for simulating Tmax (MRI-ESM2-0) also did not perform well for Tmin. Furthermore, the best performing climate model for rainfall on a specific temporal scale did not perform well on another temporal scale. The study recommends evaluation of climate models for rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin independently at different time scales for better understanding of future climates using the best performing models for each climate variable as well as for effective climate adaptation and mitigation plans.					; van Oel, Pieter/B-2080-2010; Bayabil, Haimanote/M-8241-2019; van Oel, Pieter/AAC-6636-2019; Worqlul, Abeyou/I-1788-2019; Gashaw, Temesgen/AAC-9555-2019	Melese, Tadele/0000-0002-4627-8193; van Oel, Pieter/0000-0001-7740-0537; Tarkegn, Temesgen Gashaw/0000-0002-9298-4910; 													2468-2276					DEC	2024	26								e02387	10.1016/j.sciaf.2024.e02387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2024.e02387		SEP 2024											WOS:001322629400001

However, high niche plasticity and lake morphometry may suggestively facilitate resource partitioning and coexistence between charr and whitefish. Here, we explore the trophic niche utilization (diet and habitat use) of charr and whitefish co-occurring with brown trout in the deep and oligotrophic Lake Fyresvatnet, southern Norway (59 (-) 05' N, 8 E 10' E). Using CPUE, stomach contents and stable isotope analyses, a distinct resource partitioning was revealed between brown trout and the other two species. Brown trout typically occupied the littoral zone, feeding on benthic invertebrates, surface insects and small-sized whitefish. In contrast, charr and whitefish were predominantly zooplanktivorous, but diverged somewhat in habitat utilization as charr shifted seasonally between the profundal and the littoral zone, whereas whitefish were found in the upper water layers (littoral and pelagic habitats). Accordingly, the stable isotope values of carbon (delta(13) C) reflected a pelagic orientated prey resource use for both charr and whitefish, whereas brown trout had elevated carbon and nitrogen (delta(15) N) signatures that reflected their benthivore and piscivore diet, respectively. The findings suggest that charr may not rely upon the profundal zone as a feeding habitat but as a refuge area, and may coexist with whitefish if a third competitive and predatory species like brown trout co-occur in the lake. The study indicates that a general high habitat plasticity of Arctic charr may be essential in the presently observed coexistence with a competitively superior fish species like whitefish, and that a third fish species like brown trout may facilitate this particular fish community structure.

J	Wu, YH; Zhu, LP				Wu Yanhong; Zhu Liping			The response of lake-glacier variations to climate change in Nam Co Catchment, central Tibetan Plateau, during 1970-2000	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Based upon the 1970 aero-photo topographic map, and TM/ETM satellite images taken in 1991 and 2000, the authors artificially interpreted boundaries of lake and glaciers in Nam Co Catchment, and quantified lake-glacier area variations in different stages by "integrated method" with the support of GIS. Results show that from 1970 to 2000, lake area increased from 1942.34 km(2) to 1979.79 km(2) at a rate of 1.27 km(2)/a, while glacier area decreased from 167.62 km(2) to 141.88 km(2) at a rate of 0.86 km(2)/a. The increasing rate of lake in 1991-2000 was 1.76 km(2)/a that was faster than 1.03 km(2)/a in 1970-1991, while in the same period of time, the shrinking rates of glaciers were 0.97 km(2)/a and 0.80 km(2)/a respectively. Important factors, relevant to lake and glacier response to the climate, such as air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and their values in warm and cold seasons, were discussed. The result suggests that temperature increasing is the main reason for the accelerated melting of glaciers. Lake expansion is mainly induced by the increase of the glacier melting water, increase of precipitation and obvious decrease of potential evapotranspiration. Precipitation, evaporation and their linkages with lake enlargement on regional scale need to be thoroughly studied under the background of global warming and glacier retreating.

Characterizing Seismogenic Fault Structures of the Lake Pertusillo Reservoir Induced Seismicity (Southern Italy) Using a Relocated Template-Matching Catalog	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We present a detailed analysis of the small magnitude (M-L < 3) Reservoir Induced Seismicity associated with the Pertusillo water reservoir located in the high seismic hazard zone of Val d'Agri (Southern Italy). We apply template-matching detection to a 13-month-long dense passive survey, obtaining a final high-precision double-difference catalog of 5,070 earthquakes (-0.7 < M-L < 2.6, M-C = 0.2). The new catalog allows precisely tracking the spatiotemporal distribution of the swarm-seismicity and to map the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law. We combine seismicity data with available subsurface geophysical data, fostering an improved interpretation of the induced seismicity. We identify four seismicity-clusters showing rapid changes in seismic rate which correlate to severe seasonal oscillations. Seismicity unravels new km-scale faults or better define faults partially-illuminated by template earthquakes. b-value shows a significant spatial variability, with very-high b-value (up to 2) within areas of distributed seismicity and lower (similar to 1.3) b-value for on-fault seismicity featuring larger magnitude events. Seismicity is confined within a brine-saturated fractured carbonate reservoir, while earthquake distribution and rate are controlled by the fault architecture and rock properties (e.g., inherited fluid pathways, rock fracturing, pore fluid pressure). In particular, most earthquakes reactivate, with extensional kinematics, pre-existing reverse/transpressional faults favorably oriented in the present-day extension. All observations suggest that a poroelastic stress transmission mechanism, due to the seasonal water level oscillation, can explain the Pertusillo lake seismicity. This study confirms the importance of investigating the complex interaction among stress changes caused by human activities, pre-existing faults and local stress field to correctly assess the hazard posed by induced seismicity. Plain Language Summary The Val d'Agri basin in Southern Italy is characterized by a high seismic hazard as evidenced by the strong 1857 M7.1 earthquake, whose causative fault is still debated. The area is also a natural laboratory for studying anthropogenic seismicity since it hosts two well-documented cases of seismicity induced by: (a) the exploitation of a giant oilfield with a clear case of wastewater injection-induced-seismicity and (b) the seasonal water level oscillation in the medium-size Pertusillo water reservoir (PWR). We focus on the reservoir induced seismicity to better understand the physical mechanism behind its genesis and time-space evolution. We applied a technique that allows us to extract smaller earthquakes from known ones (templates), increasing 10-times the original catalog and helping to better characterize the spatiotemporal seismicity behavior. Seismicity is organized in four distinct clusters activated in response to the seasonal loading/unloading phases of the PWR. It delineates km-scale faults and is confined within highly fractured aqueous carbonates. Our results furnish new data to understand how the stress induced by the lake level changes influences seismicity nucleation in this hazardous area, spurring for a more accurate estimation of the seismic hazard of the area.

The data-recording sites, located in the upper portion of the Rio Santa valley, also known as the Callejon de Huaylas, span an elevation range of 3738-4750ma.s.l. As many historical hydrological stations measuring daily discharge across the region became defunct after their installation in the 1950s, there was a need for new stations to be installed and an opportunity to increase the temporal resolution of the streamflow observations. Through inter-institutional collaboration, the hydrometeorological network described in this paper was deployed with the goal of evaluating how progressive glacier mass loss was impacting stream hydrology, and understanding better the local manifestation of climate change over diurnal to seasonal and interannual time scales. The four automatic weather stations supply detailed meteorological observations and are situated in a variety of mountain landscapes, with one on a high-mountain pass, another next to a glacial lake, and two in glacially carved valleys. Four additional temperature and relative humidity loggers complement the weather stations within the Llanganuco valley by providing these data across an elevation gradient. The six streamflow gauges are located in tributaries to the Rio Santa and collect high-temporal-resolution runoff data. The datasets presented here are available freely from https://doi.org/10.4211/hs.35a670e6c5824ff89b3b74fe45ca90e0 (Mateo et al., 2021). Combined, the hydrological and meteorological data collected throughout the Cordillera Blanca enable detailed research of atmospheric and hydrological processes in tropical high-mountain terrain.					; CONDOM, Thomas/F-6957-2019; Baraër, Michel/J-9351-2012; Baraer, Michel/J-9351-2012; Mark, Bryan/HMD-9537-2023	Mark, Bryan/0000-0002-4500-7957; condom, thomas/0000-0002-4408-8580; Cruz Encarnacion, Rolando/0000-0001-7166-3053; McKenzie, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0469-6469; Baraer, Michel/0000-0003-4138-3354; Mateo, Emilio/0000-0003-3890-2707; Hellstrom, Robert/0000-0002-6004-5177													1866-3508	1866-3516				JUN 24	2022	14	6					2865	2882		10.5194/essd-14-2865-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2865-2022													WOS:000815042900001

Despite the release of the AfSIS 250m resolution soil data in 2015, its benefits in improving streamflow prediction accuracy is yet to be evaluated. The focus of this study is to evaluate the improvement in prediction accuracy of an uncalibrated hydrologic model built using the recently released AfSIS 250m soil database in comparison to four other soil databases which are under use for the last decade. New hydrological insights for the region: Limited streamflow data availability has been a major impediment to assessing water resources potential of watersheds. Recently the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) provided 250m resolution datasets with soil properties for up to six soil depth layers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the flow prediction accuracy gains from the AfSIS 250m if any, in comparison to previously availed databases using un-calibrated SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic models. The performance of the un-calibrated models was evaluated using streamflow at two of the gauging stations. Evapotranspiration output from the respective models was also compared to remote sensing derived evapotranspiration estimates (MOD16 ET and ALEXI). Only marginal improvements in streamflow simulation were achieved by using the most detailed AfSIS soil. A satisfactory agreement was found in most of the area between SWAT simulated ET and MOD16 ET during the wet seasons whereas ALEXI ET products are seasonally more consistent and comparable to SWAT estimates over wide land cover types. Robust evaluation of these datasets in different landscapes and geographic regions is warranted before a specific application.

However, there are few 1000-year-long climate reconstructions with annual resolution in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In this paper, a dendroclimatic analysis was conducted for the radial growth of Qilian juniper from the upper forest limit in Wulan, Qinghai Province. The results of correlation analysis between the tree-ring widths and the climate variables indicate that the growth of junipers at the upper forest limit is mainly limited by low temperatures of September, November and February of the pregrowth season, and July of the current growth season. There is no significant correlation between the tree-ring widths and precipitation. A mean temperature from the previous year's September to the current year's April was reconstructed for the Wulan area since A.D. 1000. The reconstruction can explain 40.8% of the instrumental variance in the calibration period (1856-2002). The reconstruction shows that the 20th century is the warmest 100 years, and the 1990s is the warmest decade during the past 1000 years, while the coldest 100 years and decade occur at 1600-1699 and 1642-1651, respectively. The variations are verified well by the temperature reconstruction of the middle Qilian Mountain (QL) and the total organic carbon (TOC) in the Qinghai Lake sediments. The comparison of our reconstruction with the annual temperature reconstruction of extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere suggests that the climate of Wulan during the Medieval Warm Period is of obvious regional specialty, but there was a good response to the climate of hemispheric scales during the recent 400 years.

Modelling the propagation of turbid density inflows into a stratified lake: Daecheong Reservoir, Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE					2nd International Conference on Asian Simulation and Modelling	JAN 09-11, 2007	Chiang Mai, THAILAND					Many reservoirs and associated downstream ecosystems located in the Asian monsoon climate region are under increased pressure from the long-term negative effects of turbid flood runoff. Despite the ubiquitous use of turbidity (C-T) as a barometer of water quality and environmental "health", C-T modelling studies have been rare due to lack of detailed experimental data required for validation. This study explored the fate and transport of a turbid density flow entering a stratified reservoir (Daecheong Reservoir, Korea) through application of a coupled three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic and particle dynamics model and subsequent validation of the predictions against an extensive data-set collected during the flood season of 2004. The turbidity model simulated multiple size groups of suspended sediment (SS) and used site-specific SS-C-T relationships to convert between field measurements (C-T) and model state variables (SS). The model showed good performance in reproducing the reservoir thermal structure, flood propagation dynamics and the magnitude and distribution of turbidity in the reservoir. The turbidity modelling framework developed in this study can be adopted within a real-time management system for forecasting of turbidity and to support adaptive control of withdrawal facilities in reservoirs that suffer from turbid flood runoff.

J	Schneider, JW; Körner, F; Roscher, M; Kroner, U				Schneider, Joerg W.; Koerner, Frank; Roscher, Marco; Kroner, Uwe			Permian climate development in the northern peri-Tethys area -: The Lodeve basin, French Massif Central, compared in a European and global context	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Lodeve basin, which contains an exceptional long and nearly uninterrupted profile of Early to Late Permian continental red beds, is well correlated to the other European Permocarboniferous basins. Together they cover the time span from the Late Pennsylvanian to the Permian-Triassic boundary. Although these basins were placed within the equatorial belt for the whole Permian, several climatic changes are recorded in the sediments. Terrestrial sedimentation is governed by the interaction of climate and tectonics as well as by volcanism to a variable degree. Therefore, small scale climatic variations of the Milankovitch band are hardly discernable and if so, they could not be correlated between different basins. Indeed, larger scale climatic shifts could be identified. It is shown, that the shift from the Carboniferous icehouse to the Mesozoic warmhouse was a multi-stage process. This global warming resulted in a general aridisation of northern Pangea, indicated by outspreading playa and sabkha red beds, aeolianites and evaporites. Several short phases of increased humidity interrupted this trend, indicated by wet red beds, lake sediments and coal deposits. In central and southern Europe, these wet periods are traceable within the Late Stephanian/Lower Rotliegend (Gzhelian/Asselian), topmost Lower Rotliegend (Asselian/Sakmarian), Upper Rotliegend I (late Artinskian/early Kungurian) and Upper Rotliegend II/Zechstein (Wuchiapingian). The aridisation of the northern Pangea which accelerated near the Sakmarian/Artinskian transition is attributed to a reorganisation of the major ocean currents. Cold water currents along the western flank of the Pangea, indicated by the Permian chert event, blocks moisture transport from West onto the continent. During Roadian and Wordian the onset of an additional cold water current along the Cimmerian continents, blocks moisture transport from the East. Both phenomena together are responsible for the maximum of aridity at the Early to Middle Permian transition. Additionally, the equatorial climate has been affected by an increasing seasonality within the Late Pennsylvanian and Permian, caused by the wide shifting of the Zone of Inter-tropical Convergence (ITC) over the equator. Based on a new reconstruction of the Pangean assembly in this paper, climatic changes in the Permian are interpreted and causes of the arid-humid-arid shifts are examined. Phases of higher humidity are often related to events of global impact, like the waxing and waning of the Gondwanan glaciation, obtained in the South African Karoo Basin (Dwyka Group). But also regional events had strong climatic influence. The Zechstein transgression in the Northern and Southern Permian Basin as well as the Bellerophon transgression of the Southern Alps caused the wet phase in the Wuchiapingian. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of evaporation rate on open water bodies: energy balance estimate versus measured pan	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Much attention has been paid to establish accurately open water evaporation since the lake itself is the largest consumer of water. The aim of this study is to assess the discrepancy in the measured (pan evaporation) and estimated (Penman) evaporation rate, seasonally, based on the results from a 37-year energy budget analysis of Lake Burrumbeet, Australia. The detailed analysis of meteorological data showed that evaporation is fully radiation driven and that the effect of wind is minimal. Sensitivity analysis shows that evaporation estimation is more sensitive to shortwave radiation followed by relative humidity. An increase or decrease of estimated shortwave radiation by 10% could result in an increase or decrease of estimated evaporation up to 18%. The Penman combination method is relatively the least sensitive to wind speed but could bring a significant effect on the lake level fluctuation since a 10% increase of wind speed increases the estimated evaporation by 2.3%. The current analysis highlights the relative roles of radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed in modulating the rate of evaporation from the lake surface, by employing an inter-monthly seasonal adjustment factor to the estimated evaporation in the lake water budget analysis, with implications for the inter-monthly variability and short-term trends assessment of water resource through various meteorological parameters.

Our hypothesis was that in aquatic environments where nitrogen availability is not limiting, colonisation by rooted macrophytes changes the dynamics of the benthic nitrogen cycle, stimulating N assimilation and denitrification and increasing the system capacity to take up external nitrogen loads. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared seasonal variations of light and dark benthic metabolism, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) fluxes, denitrification and N assimilation rates in an area colonised by P. pectinatus and a reference site colonised by microphytobenthos. In both areas, the benthic system was net autotrophic and a sink for DIN (2,241-2,644 mmol m(-2) y(-1)). Plant colonisation increased nitrogen losses via denitrification by 30% compared to the unvegetated area. In contrast to what is generally observed in coastal marine systems, where the presence of rooted macrophytes limits denitrification rates, under the very high nitrate concentrations in the studied lake, both denitrification (1,237-1,570 mmol m(-2) y(-1)) and N assimilation (1,039-1,095 mmol m(-2) y(-1)) played important and comparable roles in the removal of DIN from the water column.

However, remote sensing observations often encounter challenges in this region due to persistent cloud cover, impeding comprehensive studies of water dynamics. This study introduces a novel Monthly Surface Water Mapping (MSWM) approach combining time series Sentinel-1&2 images, resulting in the generation of a Monthly Surface Water Extent (MSWE) dataset. This dataset boasts a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal resolution of one month. Validation results indicate the MSWE exhibits a significant improvement of 19.6 % and 8.9 % in F1 score compared to the temporally-aligned Global Surface Water dataset and thresholding results, respectively. The MSWE demonstrates robust spatial precision and temporal tracking capabilities, even in complex scenes and cloudy conditions. The seasonal fluctuation of surface water bodies in the Yangtze Plain was computed using the monthly dataset and a harmonic analysis model. The results characterized distinct monthly change patterns for surface water extent, allowing for the identification and quantification of four lake classes: 6 seasonal lakes, 11 weak seasonal lakes, 21 generally stable lakes, and 46 stable lakes. The MSWM stands out for its capacity to estimate surface water extent regardless of weather conditions, showcasing promising potential for extension to other regions characterized by constant cloud cover. Furthermore, the availability of a monthly water dataset contributes significantly to enhancing our spatiotemporal understanding of surface water dynamics, offering substantial benefits for sustainable water resources management.

The nitrate (NO3 -N) and ammonium (NH4+-N) are two forms of N loads that contribute to algae blooms. However, little attention is paid to the impact of environmental factors on N loads variations at different time scales. This paper used a well-calibrated and validated EFDC model to investigate the temporal patterns and trends of ammonium and nitrate from June 2016 to June 2017. This paper presented the relationship and effects between these variations and environmental factors using data from satellite and reanalysis-based observations obtained for six meteorological parameters. The relationship and effects between these variations and environmental factors were also examined at different timescales (i.e., daily, monthly and seasonal scales). Model calibration results indicated that measured values reasonably matched simulated values. The validation results revealed that relative error (RE) values were within an acceptable range. The REs of ammonium at East Taihu (S12) and Xu Lake (S23) sampling sites were 55.83% and 57.61%, while that of nitrate was 24.37% (S12) and 41.08%, respectively. The daily analysis of NH4+-N and NO3  -N variations was 7.318 & PLUSMN; 3.876 (g/m2/day) and 0.0275 & PLUSMN; 0.222 (g/m2/day), respectively. The monthly analysis showed NH4+-N and NO3 N range from 2.04 to 12.04 (g/m2/day) and 0.0008 to 0.064 (g/m2/day), respectively. The magnitude NH4+-N and NO3  -N varied and showed distinct inter-monthly variations. , The relationship between sediment fluxes and meteorological parameters showed the magnitude of correlation coefficient (r) and strength of correlation varied significantly. At daily scales, the relationship of NH4+-N and NO3  -N had a significant positive correlation with all meteorological parameters. At monthly, the correlation coefficient (r) of NH4+-N and NO3 N were heterogenous. At daily and monthly scales, air temperature and wind speed are the main drivers affecting sediment N loads' dynamics; however, the influence of relative humidity, precipitation, and evaporation on N loads are smaller. The study demonstrates the contribution of meteorological conditions to the magnitude and timing of N loadings variability in water bodies. The findings provide more insight into lake ecosystem protection and environmental remediation.					cheng, yue/JAC-6644-2023; Nooni, Isaac/H-9267-2016; Nooni (Ph.D), Isaac Kwesi/H-9267-2016; Sarpong, Linda/IAN-5012-2023	Nooni (Ph.D), Isaac Kwesi/0000-0001-6636-9554; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2023	344								118406	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118406		JUN 2023						37354595					WOS:001027583100001
J	Howey, MCL; Frederick, K				Howey, Meghan C. L.; Frederick, Kathryn			Immovable food storage facilities, knowledge, and landscape in non-sedentary societies: Perspectives from northern Michigan	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Physical food storage in immovable facilities, typically categorized as large-scale storage, is used as a scarcity mitigation strategy by some small-scale, relatively low density, non-sedentary hunter-gatherer (and low-level horticulturalist) societies. When mobile societies rely on immovable food storage facilities, they face particular technological and landscape placement challenges that must be navigated to reduce the risks of facility failure and realize scarcity mediation. We explore how the materiality and spatial positioning of immovable food storage facilities themselves can encode knowledge necessary for these facilities to form a reliable food storage system. We suggest immovable food storage facilities be understood as emplaced features, that is, as features whose placement in the landscape is the result of, but also subsequently the producer of, socioecological knowledge. We explore these ideas through a case study in the northern Great Lakes region. During the Late Precontact period (ca. AD 1000/1100-1600), socioeconomic shifts pushed communities into increasingly spatially and seasonally restricted annual mobility rounds. The region's relatively low density, egalitarian, non-sedentary hunter-gath erer-fisher and low-level horticulturalist societies turned to physical food storage in immovable facilities, in the form of subterranean cache pits, to circumvent the risks posed by socioecological variability. Exploring one inland lake landscape in detail, we find cache pit storage facilities were purposefully planned and built in ways that successfully navigated the technological and landscape placement challenges of immovable food storage in this specific setting. We found the enduring presence and use of these immovable food storage facilities in the landscape encoded and transmitted knowledge about sustaining successful food storage across spatially and temporally dispersed groups. Cache pits were emplaced features that served to enhance community well-being in the increasingly restricted socioeconomic context of Late Precontact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A.; Onyeka, Joseph			Combating viral mosaic disease of cassava in the Lake Zone of Tanzania by intercropping with legumes	CROP PROTECTION												Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) production is constrained by many factors, including the viral cassava mosaic disease (CMD). This study was conducted to explore the potential of intercropping cassava with legumes to reduce CMD effects on cassava production. Local (Lyongo Kwimba) and improved (Suma) cassava varieties were intercropped with three types of grain legumes (groundnut, Arachis hypogea L var. Upendo; cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp. var. Vuli; and green gram, Vigna radiata (L) R. Wilczek var. Imara). Monocrops of cassava with and without NPK fertilizer were included as controls. The experiment was established using a randomized complete block design with four replications in a split-plot arrangement for three seasons. Cassava varieties intercropped with cowpeas, green gram, and groundnuts and cassava monocrops with and without NPK fertilizer constituted the main plot and sub-plots, respectively. Whitefly population counts and CMD severity and incidence were measured at regular intervals. Cropping system had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on whitefly populations and CMD severity. Small whitefly populations (0-7.5 individuals per leaf) and low CMD severity (1-2.4 on a 5-point scale) were recorded in improved and local cassava varieties intercropped with green gram. The local cassava variety intercropped with green gram showed low CMD incidences (0%-40%) in all seasons. Generally, growing cassava with green gram proved effective in reducing whitefly populations and CMD incidence and severity. Intercropping cassava with grain legumes may improve cassava production and food security in CMD-prone areas of the Lake Zone of Tanzania and areas with similar environments. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Temporal Trends of Persistent Organic Pollutants: A Comparison of Different Time Series Models	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We analyzed the vapor phase atmospheric concentrations of representative persistent chemicals (i.e., alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, phenanthrene, PCB-18 and PCB-52) in samples collected at a remote site near Eagle Harbor, Michigan, and at an urban site in Chicago, Illinois, using four time series models: a modified Clausius-Clapeyron equation, a multiple linear regression that includes both a linear and an harmonic dependence on time, digital filtration (DF), and dynamic harmonic regression (DHR). The results of these different models were evaluated in terms of goodness-of-fit, long-term trends, and halving times. The four approaches all provided highly significant descriptions of the data, with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.33 to 0.96. In general, the DF and DHR methods fit the data better, capturing not only the seasonal variations of the atmospheric concentrations but also smaller scale interannual variations in the long term trends. The halving times calculated using the four methods were generally similar to one another, and they ranged from about 4 years for gamma-HCH at Chicago to about 60 years for PCB-52 at Chicago. This analysis showed that each of these four statistical methods for evaluating long-term time series has advantages and disadvantages. The choice of the appropriate method should depend on the output needed, the type of audience, and the availability and usability of the necessary software.

J	Saloranta, TM; Andersen, T				Saloranta, Tuomo M.; Andersen, Tom			MyLake - A multi-year lake simulation model code suitable for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis simulations	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis provide powerful means to enhance the performance of the models, to increase the transparency and credibility of the model results, and to allow the decision-maker to judge whether the model results are sufficiently accurate and precise to support decision-making or not. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of numerical models usually require hundreds, thousands, or even more, repeated model runs (e.g., in Monte Carlo simulation) as well as access to change the model parameters and variables on each model run. Consequently, many model codes, although widely used and well-formulated, are not well-suited for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis due to too long model execution time or due to lack of suitable interface to change model parameters and variables in an automated way. In this paper, we describe in details a lake model code, which aims to combine good simulation capabilities with efficient model execution time and easy application of numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques. This model code is called MyLake (Multi-year Lake simulation model) and it is a one-dimensional process-based model code for simulation of daily vertical distribution of lake water temperature and thus density stratification, evolution of seasonal lake ice and snow cover, sediment-water interactions, and phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics. After giving a detailed technical description of the different processes and algorithms included in the current version 1.2 of the MyLake model code, we present some results from a model application example including an Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (Extended FAST) sensitivity analysis and a simple Monte Carlo simulation based uncertainty analysis. Finally we discuss the performance of the MyLake code, especially in connection with numerical uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques.					; Andersen, Tom/B-1950-2008	Saloranta, Tuomo/0000-0001-8436-0342; 													0304-3800					SEP 16	2007	207	1					45	60		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.03.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.03.018													WOS:000249418200006

In-Season Effect of Flue Gas Desulfurization Gypsum on Soil Physical Properties	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												There is renewed interest in the application of gypsum to agricultural lands, particularly of gypsum produced during flue gas desulfurization (FGD) at coal-burning power plants. We studied the effects of land application of FGD gypsum to corn (Zea mays L.) in watersheds draining to the Great Lakes. The FGD gypsum was surface applied at 11 sites at rates of 0, 1120, 2240, and 4480 kg ha(-1) after planting to 3-m by 7.6-m field plots. Approximately 12 wk after application, penetration resistance and hydraulic conductivity were measured in situ, and samples were collected for determination of bulk density and aggregate stability. No treatment effect was detected for penetration resistance or hydraulic conductivity. A positive treatment effect was seen for bulk density at only 2 of 10 sites tested. Aggregate stability reacted similarly across all sites and was decreased with the highest application of FGD gypsum, whereas the lower rates were not different from the control. Overall, there were few beneficial effects of the FGD gypsum to soil physical properties in the year of application.

Simulating the Water Environmental Capacity of a Seasonal River Using a Combined Watershed-Water Quality Model	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												The water environmental capacity (WEC) is an effective tool to solve the water pollution problem and achieve optimal water quality management. However, in a seasonal river, some important input data such as discharge and pollution concentration from river tributaries and lateral inflows are rarely available. This makes WEC calculating more challenging. In this study, the water environment system model that integrates hydrological process in the watershed and hydrodynamic water quality process in the river is proposed to compensate for the lack of data. Taking the Guishui River basin as an example, the SWAT and HEC-RAS models were selected. The discharge and pollution concentration of ungauged tributary output from SWAT are used as the inputs of the water quality model HEC-RAS. In addition, static and dynamic design hydrological conditions were used to calculate WEC. The model results basically agree with the observed data, and it was verified that the integrated water environment system model can be used to calculate WEC. The pollutant reduction targets of the tributaries under the monthly line-fitting method are less than that under static hydrological condition. The obtained results could be used to support water pollution control and water quality management in the Guishui River basin.																				2333-5084				NOV	2020	7	11							e2019EA001008	10.1029/2019EA001008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019EA001008													WOS:000595886000017

The present work is aimed at analyzing the spatiotemporal correlations between aerosol and cloud properties during 2008-2017 derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Republic of Malawi, Southeast Africa. The annual mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550)) was found high ( > 0.23) around the Lake Malawi and its environments, and in the southern parts of the study domain, characterized by dense population and increased anthropogenic activities. Whereas, low AOD centers were noticed over the high-altitude locations of central Malawi. The seasonal mean AOD(550) was found high during September-October-November (SON) (0.32) and June-July-August (JJA) (0.24) December-January-February (DJF) (0.2), and lowest in March-April-May (MAM) (0.16). The Angstrom exponent (AE(412)(-4)(70)) sensitive to fine-mode particles was found high ( > 1.2) in most of the regions during the study period. The trend analysis from the linear regression technique found a general increase in AOD, except during SON was characterized by decreasing AOD. Besides, we investigated on understanding the relationship between AOD and cloud microphysical properties over the domain. The AOD(550) exhibited a negative correlation with cloud fraction (CF) and the cloud effective radius (CER). However, it showed a positive correlation with cloud top temperature (CTT) in areas of high AOD. Finally, the results from the backward trajectory analysis revealed that aerosols over Malawi were associated with long-range transport from the Arabian Deserts, Madagascar Island, Central Africa, and the Indian Ocean, along with locally produced aerosols during different seasons. The findings may be useful to better understand the sources and climatic effects of atmospheric aerosols in southeast Africa.

Despite the important role the westerlies play in the global climate system, past variability is poorly constrained. Here, we present a geochemical record of hydroclimate change from Lake Von in south-west New Zealand that spans the last 16 000 years. During the Lateglacial and early Holocene, we find stratigraphic and geochemical evidence for three distinct periods of low lake levels that occur during North Atlantic cold events when the Intertropical Convergence Zone is displaced southwards, Southern Ocean upwelling is enhanced and the Antarctic is rapidly warming. We attribute these hydrological changes to southward shifts of the SWW and associated storm tracks that cause arid conditions in southern New Zealand. During the early Holocene, we find evidence for an extended period of low lake levels that are caused by a combination of diminished wind strength, higher air temperatures and reduced seasonality. Finally, we interpret an overall intensification of the SWW after 5500 cal a bp. Our results support the idea that climate mechanisms originating in the high latitudes and the tropics work together to influence the SWW on millennial timescales.

K.; Norton, Stephen A.; Hoffmann, Kristine E.; Amirbahman, Aria			Methane and carbon dioxide dynamics within four vernal pools in Maine, USA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Vernal pools are small, seasonal wetlands that are a common landscape feature contributing to biodiversity in northeastern North American forests. Basic information about their biogeochemical functions, such as carbon cycling, is limited. Concentrations of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and other water chemistry parameters were monitored weekly at the bottom and surface of four vernal pools in central and eastern Maine, USA, from April to August 2016. The vernal pools were supersaturated with respect to CH4 and CO2 at all sampling dates and locations. Concentrations of dissolved CH4 and CO2 ranged from 0.4 to 210 mu mol L-1 and 72-2300 mu mol L-1, respectively. Diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 into the atmosphere ranged from 0.2 to 73 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and 30-590 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. During the study period, the four vernal pools emitted 0.1-5.8 kg C m(-2) and 9.6-120 kg C m(-2) as CH4 and CO2, respectively. The production fluxes (production rates normalized to surface area) of CH4 and CO2 ranged from -0.02 to 0.66 and 0.40-4.6 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and increased significantly over the season. Methane concentrations were best predicted by alkalinity, ortho-phosphate and depth, while CO2 concentrations were best predicted with only alkalinity. Alkalinity as a predictor variable highlights the importance of anaerobic respiration in production of both gases. Our study pools had large concentrations and effluxes of CH4 and CO2 compared to permanently inundated wetlands, indicating vernal pools are metabolically active sites and may be important contributors to the global carbon budget.

Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, has not escaped these variations. Herein, we show that the sedimentation in Poyang Lake has likely undergone a unique phase shift from sediment sink (annually storing 421 x 10(4) t) during 1960-1999 to sediment source (yearly losing 782 x 10(4) t) during 2000-2012, with respect to the Changjiang (Yangtze) River. In comparison with sedimentation during 1960-1999, Poyang Lake sedimentation during the period 2000-2012 is characterized by no deposition during the flood season and enhanced erosion during the dry season. Furthermore, Poyang Lake's largest delta, the Ganjiang Delta, prograded at a rate of 32.7 m/a from 1983 to 1996, which increased to 52.8 m/a from 1996 to 2005 but dropped significantly to 1.7 m/a from 2005 to 2015. A sediment core collected in the shallow-water shoal of the central lake indicates a stable increase in sedimentation flux from 1960 to 2002, with a mean value of 0.27 g/(cm(2).a), followed by a decline in sedimentation flux after 2002. Our findings show that the tributary sediment input from the lake catchment dominated the sedimentation of Poyang Lake prior to 2000, when it was significantly larger than the sediment output to the Changjiang River. However, thereafter, the contribution of tributary sediment to the output dropped by 50%, and the rest has been provided by the lake itself. Namely, channels along Poyang Lake's waterway became the additional source of the lake's sediment output in the 2000s.z					Wang, Jie/T-5766-2018; gao, jinjuan/AEW-3227-2022	Wang, Jie/0000-0003-4904-2394; 													1525-2027					AUG	2018	19	8					2384	2396		10.1029/2018GC007439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GC007439													WOS:000452122500006

Microcystis, Dolichospermum and Planktothrix were the key genera identified during the growing season. A trend of a remarkable increase in cyanobacterial densities was observed from 2012 to 2013 exhibiting bloom formation in June (by Nostoc linckia) with the highest values in June and August 2013, reaching up to 695.9*10(3) cells mL(-1) Seasonal dependence of cyanobacterial density on temperature, and temperature as a driver for cyanobacterial cells growth and development were suggested. Biogenic nutrients were identified as co-drivers determining species richness and dominance, as well as the distribution of phytoplankton in different parts of the reservoir. Cyanotoxin concentrations in the filtered biomass were reported during July 2012 for both stations of the reservoir (left and right bank). Microcystin-RR (MC-RR) was the most abundant and the most frequently observed cyanotoxin. Lower MC-LR concentrations were identified in all samples from both stations, with the highest values observed at the right bank in July 2012. [D-Asp(3)]MC-RR, MC-YR, MCHtyR, [D-Asp(3)]MC-LR, MC-HilR, MC-WR, MC-LY and MC-LW were also identified in trace levels. Anatoxin-a (ANA) was reported in the samples from both stations during August 2012. Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) was present in trace concentrations in samples from both stations during July and in the sample from the left bank during September. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					16th workshop of the International-Association-for-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology (IAP)	AUG 21-28, 2011	Trento, ITALY					Only few scientific investigations have been carried out, to our knowledge, on phytoplankton in Mediterranean temporary ponds. To test the hypothesis that climate forcing is the main factor affecting dynamics and structure of planktic algae in these peculiar ecosystems, and to assess the importance of human impacts on this basic component of the aquatic biota, phytoplankton structure and dynamics were analysed in two temporary, long lasting (9 months), ponds, and in a permanent one. The three studied water bodies can be classified as meso-eutrophic, which show extended macrophyte beds and are subjected to one or more human impacts, such as eutrophication, fish and plant introduction, and garbage pollution. Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly over two different periods in each pond. The identified phytoplankton taxa were grouped in functional coda and non-parametric ordination methods were used to analyse their annual patterns. Results showed a well-defined sequence of coda, which followed a common seasonal pattern in all the studied ponds, when the ordination techniques were applied to a singular water body. This pattern was overlapping in the three studied environments without apparent influence exerted either by the environmental typology (e.g. permanent or temporary) or by human impacts. However, when the analyses were carried out by means of a single matrix containing the coda shared by all the studied environments, they formed a cluster separating the single ponds rather than following common/overlapping seasonal patterns. The results suggest that local effects, particularly the specific composition and richness of phytoplankton assemblages, are as important as climate constraints.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	BARONE, Rossella/0000-0001-5777-0688; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2012	698	1					147	159		10.1007/s10750-012-1059-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1059-3													WOS:000309345700012

The widely used criteria of 8-12 degrees C underestimated lake trout habitat use by 68%-80%. Instead, combined temperature (<12 or 15 degrees C) and DO (>4 or 6 mg . L-1) criteria most closely matched lake trout habitat use, had a similar seasonal trend as the tagged fish, suggested modest reductions (5% of total lake volume) in habitat during a warmer year, and performed best when the constraints of temperature and DO were most limiting. All data were collected in a small boreal shield lake (27 ha, z(max) = 21 m) at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, during two contrasting periods of thermal stratification (2003: warmer and longer; 2004: cooler and shorter), providing an assessment of observed and theoretical habitat volumes over Current environmental extremes.

J	Moon, YE; Kim, HS				Moon, Ye-eun; Kim, Hyun-su			Inter-Annual and Seasonal Variations of Water Quality and Trophic Status of a Reservoir with Fluctuating Monsoon Precipitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Long-term evaluation from 2000 to 2020 of a temperate reservoir indicated that water quality and trophic status were not critically controlled by the inter-annual dynamics of monsoon precipitation. The fluctuation of annual concentrations of TP, TSS, and EC did not always correlate with the variation of precipitation. BOD and COD demonstrated monotonically increasing trends with Sen's slope of 0.02 and 0.01, respectively, while Chl-a manifested a decreasing trend (slope = -0.23). The increases of different magnitudes in the levels of TP, TSS, and Chl-a in the monsoon and the early post-monsoon periods were observed in the drought, flood, and normal years. The drought years showed distinct seasonal variations in many parameters, while those in the flood and the normal years were very similar. Pearson correlation and empirical regression analyses resulted in weaker correlation between water quality and hydrological parameters than other reservoirs, which, along with low impact of precipitation, was attributed to the low drainage ratio (28.8) of the study area. BOD/COD ratios were higher than 0.5 in the reservoir, indicating the presence of a significant fraction of biodegradable organic matter. The ratio increased in the longitudinal flow direction (>50% in the drought years), implying the possibility of autochthonous sources of organic matter. TSID evaluation resulted in variation of limiting factors not related to the fluctuation of annual precipitation. The loadings of the significant principal components were very similar among the different precipitation groups, supporting the other findings that annual precipitation governed by monsoon intensity would not solely control the water quality dynamics of the study area.																				1660-4601				AUG	2021	18	16							8499	10.3390/ijerph18168499	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168499								34444247					WOS:000689327900001
J	Sadro, S; Melack, JM; MacIntyre, S				Sadro, Steven; Melack, John M.; MacIntyre, Sally			Spatial and Temporal Variability in the Ecosystem Metabolism of a High-elevation Lake: Integrating Benthic and Pelagic Habitats	ECOSYSTEMS												We characterized spatial and temporal variability in net ecosystem production (NEP), community respiration (CR), and gross primary production (GPP) over an ice-free season in an oligotrophic high-elevation lake using high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen. We combined the use of free-water and incubation chamber measurements to compare pelagic and benthic habitats and estimate their relative contributions to whole-lake metabolism. Despite a brief period of predominant heterotrophy after snowmelt, both free-water and incubation chamber measurements confirmed autotrophy of the epilimnion in all habitats throughout the ice-free season. In contrast, benthic incubation chambers showed the benthos to be consistently heterotrophic. Although temperature was the strongest seasonal driver of benthic metabolism, bacterioplankton density and indexes of organic matter quality explained the most variability in pelagic metabolism. Driven largely by benthic metabolism, free-water measurements of GPP and CR were twice as high in littoral than pelagic habitats. However, rates of water column primary production overlying the littoral benthos were high enough to overcome net benthic heterotrophy, and seasonal mean NEP in littoral habitats remained positive and not significantly different from pelagic habitats. Benthic rates averaged about 25% of whole lake metabolism. Pelagic metabolism measurements were affected by littoral rates about half the time, with the degree of isolation between the two a function of advection and water column stability. These results emphasize the importance of characterizing spatial and temporal variability in metabolism within the context of physical dynamics and challenge the notion that benthic metabolism will necessarily be larger than pelagic metabolism in oligotrophic lakes.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				NOV	2011	14	7					1123	1140		10.1007/s10021-011-9471-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-011-9471-5													WOS:000300144100007

Wildland or prescribed burns and residential wood combustion emissions can vary due to differences in fuel, season, time of day, and the nature of the combustion. Inadequate understanding of the relevance of these biomass combustion emissions is due to the lack of characterization of open combustion emissions and the limited understanding of the differences between these and residential wood combustion. To provide new insight to biomass combustion emissions, sampling was conducted in several types of conditions. Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) were collected during four separate prescribed burns in three different ecosystems, Mariposa Sequoia Grove within Yosemite National Park, CA, desert brushes of central rural Nevada, and Toiyabye National Forest near Lake Tahoe, NV. SVOC samples were also collected under controlled conditions for several wildland fuels, including conifer needles, wildland grasses, and sagebrush. Fireplace emissions from simulated residential wood combustion were also collected and are included here for comparison. A high degree of variability was found in the emissions of organic carbon, elemental carbon, levoglucosan, methoxy phenols, and organic acids. The variability in the emissions of levoglucosan does not correlate with the PM2.5 gravimetric mass and thus may affect source apportionment estimates.

Taihu Lake has experienced serious surface water quality deterioration and eutrophication problems since the 1980s. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of fertilization changes since the 1980s on the N loss with runoff and leaching in the rice-wheat cropping rotation system. According to the results published in the literature since the 1980s, we set up four fertilization scenarios-N1980s: a fertilization rate of 350 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) with 30% in manure fertilization to simulate fertilization in the 1980s; NA1990s: a fertilization rate of 500 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) with 10% in manure fertilization to simulate fertilization in the early 1990s; NL1990s: fertilization rate of 600 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) with 10% in manure fertilization to simulate fertilization in the late 1990s; and N2000s: fertilization rate of 550 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) with all chemicals to simulate fertilization in the 2000s. Then, we calibrated and validated the DNDC (denitrification-decomposition) model through field experiments in two rice-wheat rotation seasons from November 2011 to October 2013 and simulated the N loss with runoff and leaching since the 1980s. The results show that N losses with leaching in the four periods (N 1980s, NA1990s, NL1990s, and N2000s) were 5.2 +/- 2.1, 9.4 +/- 3.2, 14.4 +/- 4.6 and 13.5 +/- 4.6 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1), respectively. N losses with surface runoff were 7.9 +/- 3.9, 18.3 +/- 7.2, 25.4 +/- 10.2, and 26.5 +/- 10.6 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1), respectively. The total N loss through runoff and leaching showed an increasing trend from 1980 to the late 1990s, when it reached its peak. The increase in N export to water due to fertilizer application occurs mainly during the rainy season from March to August, and especially from June to August, when rainfall events and intensive rice fertilization activities are frequent. After the 1990s, when the fertilizer rate was above 500 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1), the crop yields no longer increased significantly, which indicates that the optimized fertilization rate to balance crop yields and N loss to water is lower than 500 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1). The increase in fertilizer use has been unnecessary since the early 1990s, and at least about 30% of the N loss could have been prevented without reducing crop yields.																				2073-4441				MAR	2020	12	3							886	10.3390/w12030886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030886													WOS:000529249500271

It is located in an evaporitic and karstic environment, and a saline lake affected by highly seasonal precipitation and evaporation. Geochemical and mineralogical data of core CO1313 combined with a robust age model show variation that contributes to the understanding of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic change. This study shows a pollen record that has been conducted on core CO1313, together with charcoal and non-pollen palynomorph analyses. The environmental and climatological history reconstruction of Lake Medina starts in early Holocene times (at 9.5 cal. ka BP) and shows intensified pasture and land use during middle-Holocene times as well as the 8.2 and 4.2 cal. ka BP abrupt climate events. Oxidation of plant remnants and resulting non-preservation at certain times reinforces the hypothesis of intense climate effects on vegetation during the 4.2 cal. ka BP climate event. Yet, oxidation of plant residues during other episodes shows other periods that were also affected by reduced precipitation. From around 2 cal. ka BP onwards, a recent trend towards aridification and enforced seasonality was detected.

Rorippa aquatica (Brassicaceae) is a semi-aquatic North American plant with morphological differences between several accessions, but little information available on any physiological differences. Here, we surveyed the transcriptomes of two R. aquatica accessions and identified cryptic physiological differences between them. We first reconstructed a Rorippa phylogeny to confirm relationships between the accessions. We performed large-scale RNA-seq and de novo assembly; the resulting 87,754 unigenes were then annotated via comparisons to different databases. Between-accession physiological variation was identified with transcriptomes from both accessions. Transcriptome data were analyzed with principal component analysis and self-organizing map. Results of analyses suggested that photosynthetic capability differs between the accessions. Indeed, physiological experiments revealed between-accession variation in electron transport rate and the redox state of the plastoquinone pool. These results indicated that one accession may have adapted to differences in temperature or length of the growing season.

J	Zhang, JH; Liu, JL; Zhang, JB; Cheng, YN; Wang, WP				Zhang Jun-Hua; Liu Jian-Li; Zhang Jia-Bao; Cheng Ya-Nan; Wang Wei-Peng			Nitrate-Nitrogen Dynamics and Nitrogen Budgets in Rice-Wheat Rotations in Taihu Lake Region, China	PEDOSPHERE												Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) dynamics and nitrogen (N) budgets in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations in the Taihu Lake region of China were studied to compare the effects of N fertilizer management over a two-year period. The experiment included four N rates for rice and wheat, respectively: N1 (125 and 94 kg N ha(-1)), N2 (225 and 169 kg N ha(-1)), N3 (325 and 244 kg N ha(-1)), and NO (0 kg N ha(-1)). The results showed that an overlying water layer during the rice growing seasons contributed to moderate concentrations of NO3--N in sampled waters and the concentrations of NO3--N only showed a rising trend during the field drying stage. The NO3--N concentrations in leachates during the wheat seasons were much higher than those during the rice seasons, particularly in the wheat seedling stage. In the wheat seedling stage, the NO3--N concentrations of leachates were significantly higher in N treatments than in N0 treatment and increased with increasing N rates. As the NO3--N content (below 2 mg N L-1) at a depth of 80 cm during the rice-wheat rotations did not respond to the applied N rates, the high levels of NO3--N in the groundwater of paddy fields might not be directly related to NO3--N leaching. Crop growth trends were closely related to variations of NO3--N in leachates. A reduction in N application rate, especially in the earlier stages of crop growth, and synchronization of the peak of N uptake by the crop with N fertilizer application are key measures to reduce N loss. Above-ground biomass for rice and wheat increased significantly with increasing N rate, but there was no significant difference between N2 and N3. Increasing N rates to the levels greater than N2 not only decreased N use efficiency, but also significantly increased N loss. After two cycles of rice-wheat rotations, the apparent N losses of N1, N2 and N3 amounted to 234, 366 and 579 kg N ha(-1), respectively. With an increase of N rate from N0 to N3, the percentage of N uptake in total N inputs decreased from 63.9% to 46.9%. The apparent N losses during the rice seasons were higher than those during the wheat seasons and were related to precipitation; therefore, the application of fertilizer should take into account climate conditions and avoid application before heavy rainfall.

The data matrix has been built according to the results, which were analyzed by fuzzy c-mean cluster (FCM) and cluster analysis (CA). This analysis has identified anthropogenic effects and seasonal characters of water quality. The dry and wet seasonality have been demonstrated with FCM and CA. The precipitation and the Southeast Asian monsoons, northeasterly from October to the next April and southwesterly from May to September have also an important influence on water quality in Daya Bay. In the spatial pattern, two groups have been classified with FCM and CA. Cluster I consisted of the sites S3, S8, S10 and S11 in the west and north coastal parts of Daya Bay. Cluster I is mainly related to anthropogenic activities such as fish-farming. Cluster II consisted of the rest of the stations in the center, east and south parts of Daya Bay. Cluster II is mainly related to seawater input from South China Sea. Thus, fuzzy c-mean cluster and cluster analysis can be an important tool for the successful characterization of regional-scale water quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the composition of phytoplankton functional groups in Poyang Lake and their drivers, field investigations were conducted over three years: 2013, 2014, and 2016. Phytoplankton were dominated by diatoms, contributing from 20.19% to 57.57% of the total biomass, followed by cyanobacteria, 9.81%-39.98%. Microcystis sp. and Anabaena sp. were the dominant species among cyanobacteria. Twenty-six functional groups were identified among 72 genera or species, and fiver groups (P, B, MP, H1, and G) were categorized dominant. All of dominant groups except H1 were tolerate highly fluctuating mixing intensities and showed a typical monthly succession variation. Water temperature, water level, and nutrients are key drivers for the variation of phytoplankton communities at taxonomic and functional levels. Both of redundancy and variation partitioning analyses showed that environmental variables might explain functional groups better than taxonomic communities, implying that the functional groups were more advantageous in showing the effects of environmental conditions than taxonomic compositions. Hydrological conditions have a crucial influence on phytoplankton assemblage dynamics in highly variable water regime lakes, but not in the largest ones. The functional groups method is suitable for identifying the spatial and seasonal characteristics of aquatic environments that significantly affected by water regimes.

Evaluating common drivers for color, iron and organic carbon in Swedish watercourses	AMBIO												The recent browning (increase in color) of surface waters across much of the northern hemisphere has important implications for light climate, ecosystem functioning, and drinking water treatability. Using log-linear regressions and long-term (6-21 years) data from 112 Swedish watercourses, we identified temporal and spatial patterns in browning-related parameters [iron, absorbance, and total organic carbon (TOC)]. Flow variability and lakes in the catchment were major influences on all parameters. Co-variation between seasonal, discharge-related, and trend effects on iron, TOC, and absorbance were dependent on pH, landscape position, catchment size, latitude, and dominant land cover. Large agriculture-dominated catchments had significantly larger trends in iron, TOC, and water color than small forest catchments. Our results suggest that while similarities exist, no single mechanism can explain the observed browning but show that multiple mechanisms related to land cover, climate, and acidification history are responsible for the ongoing browning of surface waters.

This study aimed to measure and analyze the absorption and backscattering coefficients of the main water constituents and, further, to analyze their relations to the water constituent concentrations in Poyang Lake, China. The concentrations and the absorption and backscattering coefficients of the main water constituents at 47 sampling sites were measured and analyzed as follows. (1) The concentrations of chlorophyll a (C-CHL), dissolved organic carbon (C-DOC), suspended particulate matter (C-SPM), including suspended particulate inorganic matter (C-SPIM) and suspended particulate organic matter (C-SPOM), and the absorption coefficients of total particulate (a(p)), phytoplankton (a(ph)), nonpigment particulate (a(d)), and colored/chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(g)) were measured in the laboratory. (2) The total backscattering coefficients, including the contribution of pure water at six wavelengths of 420, 442, 470, 510, 590, and 700 nm, were measured in the field with a HydroScat-6 backscattering sensor. (3) The backscattering coefficients without the contribution of pure water (b(b)) were then derived by subtracting the backscattering coefficients of pure water from the total backscattering coefficients. (4) The C-CHL, C-SPM, C-SPIM, C-SPOM, and C-DOC of the 41 remaining water samples were statistically described and their correlations were analyzed. (5) The a(ph), a(d), a(p), a(g), and b(b) were visualized and analyzed, and their relations to C-CHL, C-SPM, C-SPIM, C-SPOM, or C-DOC were studied. Results showed the following. (1) Poyang Lake was a suspended particulate inorganic matter dominant lake with low phytoplankton concentration. (2) One salient aph absorption peak was found at 678 nm, and it explained 72% of the variation of C-CHL. (3) The a(d) and a(p) exponentially decreased with increasing wavelength, and they explained 74% of the variation of C-SPIM and 71% variation of C-SPM, respectively, at a wavelength of 440nm. (4) The ag also exponentially decreased with increasing wavelength, and it had no significant correlation to C-DOC at a significance level of 0.05. (5) The bb decreased with increasing wavelength, and it had strong and positive correlations to C-SPM, C-SPIM and C-SPOM, a strong and negative correlation to C-CHL, and no correlation to C-DOC at a significance level of 0.05. Such results will be helpful for the understanding of the IOPs of Poyang Lake. They, however, only represented the IOPs during the sampling time period, and more measurements and analyses in different seasons need to be carried out in the future to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the IOPs of Poyang Lake.

Taxonomic diversity of the freshwater Zooplankton in Argentina: A review	LIMNOLOGICA												Argentina, an extensive country located in southern South America, encompasses a considerable range of latitude and altitude, with a high diversity of lowland and highland waterbodies. Our study is aimed at providing information regarding the current taxonomic diversity of the main groups of the country's inland-water zooplankton. A total of 242 Protozoa, 375 Rotifera Monogononta, 170 Cladocera, and 120 Copepoda species and subspecies are reported. We submit considerations of the current level of taxonomic knowledge, the regional distribution of the species, and the biogeographical (or zoogeographical) aspects. Since most research was focused on a few regions or a small number of water bodies within large regions, many habitats have been scarcely studied, particularly in areas with wide seasonal or interannual variability. We assume that the potential species number in all groups is much higher than currently recognized. Further studies at wider spatial and temporal scales and at a higher taxonomical resolution as well, are needed in order to provide a full picture of the zooplankton diversity of Argentina.						, JUAN CESAR PAGGI/0009-0002-2219-6369; Claps, Maria/0000-0002-7459-3238													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2023	100								126029	10.1016/j.limno.2022.126029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.126029		JUN 2023											WOS:001026726300001

This study assessed the spatial-seasonal abundance and diversity of ostracods along the salinity gradient of Chilika Lagoon (India) by seasonally collecting substrate sediment from twenty-two fixed stations along with the environmental parameters of lagoonbottom water in Asia's largest brackish water lagoon. The samples were analyzed for living and dead ostracod species abundance, diversity and correlated with environmental parameters. The river mouth proximal region having sandy silt substrate under low energy conditions and high total organic carbon, had a higher abundance of low salinity tolerant ostracod species. The interior region of the lagoon showed a high abundance and diversity of variable salinity tolerant brackish water species, with a high proportion of dead specimens. In the region proximal to the sea mouth that is influenced by high energy conditions and sandy substrate, ostracod abundance and diversity are low, and only a few very high salinity tolerant ostracod species are found. Canonical correspondence analysis in addition to environmental preferences of living ostracod species and articulated valve abundance suggest environment-specific ostracod assemblages, consistent with the traditional use of ostracod species as a proxy to reconstruct paleo coastal ecology and paleoenvironment.

This study focused on the Lake Kivu catchment in Rwanda, analysing LULCC from 1990 to 2020, identifying major variables, and predicting future LULC scenarios under different development trajectories. Image classification was conducted in Google Earth Engine using random forest classifier, by incorporating seasonal composites Landsat images, spectral indices, and topographic features, to enhance discrimination and capture seasonal variations. The results demonstrated an overall accuracy exceeding 83%. Historical analysis revealed significant changes, including forest loss (26.6 to 18.7%) and agricultural land expansion (27.7 to 43%) in the 1990-2000 decade, attributed to political conflicts and population movements. Forest recovery (24.8% by 2020) was observed in subsequent decades, driven by Rwanda's sustainable development initiatives. A Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network from Land Change Modeler predicted distinct 2030 and 2050 LULC scenarios based on natural, socio-economic variables, and historical transitions. Analysis of explanatory variables highlighted the significant role of proximity to urban centers, population density, and terrain in LULCC. Predictions indicate distinct trajectories influenced by demographic and socio-economic trends. The study recommends adopting the Green Growth Economy scenario aligned with ongoing conservation measures. The findings contribute to identifying opportunities for land restoration and conservation efforts, promoting the preservation of Lake Kivu catchment's ecological integrity, in alignment with national and global goals.

During this seasonal transition, diazotrophic cyanobacteria exploit the abundant phosphate and fix nitrogen after other phytoplankton taxa have consumed the available nitrate. However, it remains less clear, which mechanisms favour diazotrophic cyanobacteria under more heavily stratified conditions with lower levels of excess phosphate and persistent nitrate-depletion. Here, we collected profiles of physicochemical parameters, nutrients and photo-pigments, as well as the medium- to large-sized phytoplankton community during two lake-wide cruises to elucidate to what extent the abundance of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in Lake Tanganyika may be controlled by the nitrate resupply through the thermocline into the euphotic zone. At stations where nitrate was depleted, but phosphate remained available near the surface, high densities of diazotrophic cyanobacteria were associated with a low nitrate supply to surface waters. Our data provide first support for two conceptual scenarios, where the relative position of the thermocline and the euphotic depth may create a functional niche for diazotrophic cyanobacteria: when the upward transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone is reduced by a subjacent thermocline, diazotrophic cyanobacteria, comprising Dolichospermum and Anabaenopsis, are key players in the medium-to large-sized phytoplankton community. By contrast, a thermocline located within the euphotic zone allows for a rapid vertical transport of nitrate for a thriving nitrate-assimilating phytoplankton community that evidently outcompetes diazotrophic cyanobacteria. This study highlights that, under nitrogen-depleted conditions, diazotrophic cyanobacteria can also grow in response to a reduced nutrient resupply to the productive surface waters.

Changes in Gas-Phase Air Pollutants across New York State, USA	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												Over the past several decades, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has monitored air quality in urban, suburban, and rural locations across the state. Such data are used to determine compliance with national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), as well as track the effectiveness of pollutant emission controls. This paper summarizes the changes in gas-phase criteria and related pollutants on an annual, seasonal and diurnal basis across New York, USA. Annual average and peak concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have decreased by 50% or more since 1980 across New York, generally consistent with anthropogenic emissions reductions across different source sectors over the past 35 years. At the same time, annual average concentrations of the secondary pollutant ozone (O-3) appear flat or are increasing even though peak daily 8-hour concentrations have declined. This pollutant will likely remain a challenging public health issue for the foreseeable future.

J	James, WF				James, William F.			Diffusive phosphorus fluxes in relation to the sediment phosphorus profile in Big Traverse Bay, Lake of the Woods	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The role of sediment diffusive phosphorus (P) flux in the P economy and cyanobacteria blooms in Lake of the Woods (LOW) is needed to establish total maximum daily load requirements. I quantified aerobic and anaerobic diffusive P fluxes as a function of temperature to estimate annual internal P loading in Big Traverse Bay of LOW. Replicate cores were collected seasonally and incubated at 5, 11, 18, and 25 C for rate determination. In addition, a sediment core collected in February 2015 was sectioned to analyze sediment P fractions and characterize P burial. Aerobic and anaerobic diffusive P fluxes varied nonlinearly with temperature. Rates were lowest under aerobic conditions, ranging between 0.05 and 0.36 mg/m(2)/d, and much higher under anaerobic conditions, ranging between 0.77 and 16.78 mg/m(2)/d, at 5 and 25 C, respectively. The annual diffusive P flux contribution to Big Traverse was 38 and 1172 mg/m2/yr under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, based on mean monthly bottom temperatures in 2015. The sediment vertical P profile exhibited a distinct surface-maximum, suggesting an imbalance between gross deposition and burial. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate, potential annual internal P loading was higher at 246 mg/m(2)/yr compared to the annual aerobic diffusive P flux, suggesting anaerobic diffusive P flux and other unmeasured internal P loading processes contributed to the P budget. Low P burial efficiency and maintenance of a surface P bulge may be due to cyanobacteria-mediated biological uptake of sediment P, recycling, and redeposition to the sediment surface.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					360	368		10.1080/10402381.2017.1346010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1346010													WOS:000423047200004

After dry seasons, flooding causes recruitment in 2 ways: floods bring in allochthonous macrophytes with associated pleuston communities, and these rising water levels rehydrate plants and attached (ostracod) eggs that dried at the onset of the dry season. We analysed the ostracods communities in the Araguaia River floodplain (Brazil) during 2 hydrological periods (dry and rainy) and evaluated the species distribution in relation to abiotic and biotic factors. We compared the ostracod fauna of 6 lakes in the dry and rainy period and 17 lakes in the rainy period. We tested the hypothesis that the highest values of ostracod community attributes (richness, density, and evenness) occur in the rainy season owing to the influx of allochthonous individuals and the rehydration of the dried autochthonous macrophytes. We indeed observed the highest richness and diversity of ostracods in the rainy season; the homogenizing effect of the flood pulse at the onset of the rainy season caused a more homogeneous fauna (lower beta diversity) during that hydrological period. The distribution of species showed a significant effect of both abiotic factors (local) and hydrological period (regional).

During the early to mid-Holocene, large fresh-water lakes extended in the lowland deserts of Ramlat as-Sab'atayn (Yemen) and Wahiba Sands (Oman), which were very similar to those occurring in the North, in the Rub' al-Khali (Saudi Arabia), at that time. Many archaeological sites, characterized by scattered stone artefacts, ostrich-eggshells and bones around hearths, are related to this lacustrine phase, which culminated around 10 000-8000 cal yr B.P. in the lowland deserts before the lakes progressively dried up. The last record of fresh-water bodies' extensions date back 7300 cal yr B.P. at Shabwa (Yemen) and 7500 cal yr B.P. at al-Haid (Oman). Then, fresh-water was probably available only from seasonal run-off from adjacent highlands, where paleolakes persisted into the late Holocene. Dry climate conditions in the inland desert of Yemen during the late Holocene coincide with a phase of intensive human inhabitation as testified by development of irrigation in the piedmontane areas, numerous necropolises of built collective burials and houses.

Evaluation of real-time hydrometeorological ensemble prediction on hydrologic scales in Northern California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The paper presents an evaluation of real time ensemble forecasts produced during 2010-2012 by the demonstration project INFORM (Integrated Forecast and Reservoir Management) in Northern California. In addition, the innovative elements of the forecast component of the INFORM project are highlighted. The forecast component is designed to dynamically downscale operational multi-lead ensemble forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and the Climate Forecast system (CFS) of the National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and to use adaptations of the operational hydrologic models of the US National Weather Service California Nevada River Forecast Center to provide ensemble reservoir inflow forecasts in real time. A full-physics 10-km resolution (10 km on the side) mesoscale model was implemented for the ensemble prediction of surface precipitation and temperature over the domain of Northern California with lead times out to 16 days with 6-hourly temporal resolution. An intermediate complexity regional model with a 10 km resolution was implemented to downscale the NCEP CFS ensemble forecasts for lead times out to 41.5 days. Methodologies for precipitation and temperature model forecast adjustment to comply with the corresponding observations were formulated and tested as regards their effectiveness for improving the ensemble predictions of these two variables and also for improving reservoir inflow forecasts. The evaluation is done using the real time databases of INFORM and concerns the snow accumulation and melt seasons. Performance is measured by metrics that range from those that use forecast means to those that use the entire forecast ensemble. The results show very good skill in forecasting precipitation and temperature over the subcatchments of the INFORM domain out to a week in advance for all basins, models and seasons. For temperature, in some cases, non-negligible skill has been obtained out to four weeks for the melt season. Reservoir inflow forecasts exhibit also good skill for the shorter lead-times out to a week or so, and provide a good quantitative basis in support of reservoir management decisions pertaining to objectives with a short term horizon (e.g., flood control and energy production). For the northernmost basin of Trinity reservoir inflow forecasts exhibit good skill for lead times longer than 3 weeks in the snow melt season. Bias correction of the ensemble precipitation and temperature forecasts with fixed bias factors over the range of lead times improves forecast performance for almost all leads for precipitation and temperature and for the shorter lead times for reservoir inflow. The results constitute a first look at the performance of operational coupled hydrometeorological ensemble forecasts in support of reservoir management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Underestimation of rotifer abundance a much greater problem than previously appreciated	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Although rotifers are important components of aquatic food webs and suitable sampling methods have been described and tested in the peer-reviewed literature, they are frequently overlooked or quantified with improper methods (e. g., mesh sizes >= 63 mu m) in freshwater ecology studies. As a result, we believe that the role of rotifers in aquatic food webs and ecosystem processes remains underappreciated, and this conceptual shortfall is exacerbated by the continued use of improper sampling methodology. We examined density and biomass estimates of metazoan zooplankton in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers from two sampling methods. The macrozooplankton method was designed to target cladocerans, adult and juvenile copepods, by filtering 180 L water through a 63-mu m mesh. The microzooplankton method was designed to target rotifers and copepod nauplii by filtering 18 L water through a 20-mu m mesh. The macrozooplankton method underestimated the density and biomass of common rotifers by two to three orders of magnitude, a far greater amount of error than reported in previous studies. This bias in density estimates for rotifers decreased with increasing mean length of rotifers. The microzooplankton method proved to be ineffective for quantifying cladoceran species richness or cladoceran density at the species level. We urge aquatic ecologists to match their sampling methodology with the specific goals of their study. An accurate understanding of the role of rotifers in freshwater ecosystems will only be possible when the use of appropriate methodology becomes the rule rather than the exception.

The adaptive capacity of livelihoods largely defines the extent to which people can cope with future environmental changes, whether caused by climate change or other factors such as land use changes and water resources development. This article analyses the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural livelihoods around Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake, an exceptional lake-floodplain system dominated by flood pulse. The research findings demonstrate that despite the people's tradition of adapting to the remarkable seasonal variation of water and related resources, their capacity to adapt to unusual environmental changes is weak, with the poorest being clearly the most vulnerable group. Reasons for the weak resilience include villages' relatively homogenous livelihood structures, unjust governance practices, increasing inequality and the lack of opportunities for livelihood diversification. It is concluded that while climate change is likely to pose a remarkable challenge to people's livelihoods in the longer term, climate change adaptation activities should also take into account other environmental changes. Equally critical is the understanding of the broader socio-political context and its dynamics in increasing-and decreasing-livelihood resilience.					; Keskinen, Marko/B-2886-2012; Varis, Olli/G-6506-2011	Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Keskinen, Marko/0000-0001-5236-2327; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				MAR	2010	1	1					87	101		10.2166/wcc.2010.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2010.010													WOS:000208249200007

Timescales for the development of methanogenesis and free gas layers in recently-deposited sediments of Arkona Basin (Baltic Sea)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arkona Basin (southwestern Baltic Sea) is a seasonally-hypoxic basin characterized by the presence of free methane gas in its youngest organic-rich muddy stratum. Through the use of reactive transport models, this study tracks the development of the methane geochemistry in Arkona Basin as this muddy sediment became deposited during the last 8 kyr. Four cores are modeled each pertaining to a unique geochemical scenario according to their respective contemporary geochemical profiles. Ultimately the thickness of the muddy sediment and the flux of particulate organic carbon are crucial in determining the advent of both methanogenesis and free methane gas, the timescales over which methanogenesis takes over as a dominant reaction pathway for organic matter degradation, and the timescales required for free methane gas to form.

AN INEXPENSIVE, TEMPORALLY INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MONITORING OCCURRENCE AND BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF AQUATIC CONTAMINANTS IN THE FIELD	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Assessment of potential risks of complex contaminant mixtures in the environment requires integrated chemical and biological approaches. In support of the US Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the US Environmental Protection Agency lab in Duluth, MN, is developing these types of methods for assessing possible risks of aquatic contaminants in near-shore Great Lakes (USA) sites. One component involves an exposure system for caged fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) adults suitable for the wide range of habitat and deployment situations encountered in and around the Great Lakes. To complement the fish exposure system, the authors developed an automated device for collection of composite water samples that could be simultaneously deployed with the cages and reflect a temporally integrated exposure of the animals. The present study describes methodological details of the design, construction, and deployment of a flexible yet comparatively inexpensive (<600 USD) caged-fish/autosampler system. The utility and performance of the system were demonstrated with data collected from deployments at several Great Lakes sites. For example, over 3 field seasons, only 2 of 130 deployed cages were lost, and approximately 99% of successfully deployed adult fish were recovered after exposures of 4 d or longer. A number of molecular, biochemical, and apical endpoints were successfully measured in recovered animals, changes in which reflected known characteristics of the study sites (e. g., upregulation of hepatic genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism in fish held in the vicinity of wastewater treatment plants). The automated composite samplers proved robust with regard to successful water collection (>95% of deployed units in the latest field season), and low within-and among-unit variations were found relative to programmed collection volumes. Overall, the test system has excellent potential for integrated chemical-biological monitoring of contaminants in a variety of field settings.

J	Dou, M; Zhang, Y; Li, GQ				Dou, Ming; Zhang, Yan; Li, Guiqiu			Temporal and spatial characteristics of the water pollutant concentration in Huaihe River Basin from2003 to 2012, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Based on the monitoring data of 78 monitoring stations from 2003 to 2012, five key water quality indexes (biochemical oxygen demand: BOD5, permanganate index: CODMn, dissolved oxygen: DO, ammonium nitrogen: NH3-N, and total phosphorus: TP) were selected to analyze their temporal and spatial characteristics in the highly disturbed Huaihe River Basin via Mann-Kendall trend analysis and boxplot analysis. The temporal and spatial variations of water pollutant concentrations in the Huaihe River Basin were investigated and analyzed to provide a scientific basis for water pollution control, water environment protection, and ecological restoration. The results indicated that the Yinghe River, Quanhe River, Honghe River, Guohe River, and Baohe River were the most seriously polluted rivers, followed by Hongze Lake, Luoma Lake, Yishuhe River, and Nansi Lake. BOD5, CODMn, and NH3-N were the major pollution indexes, for which the monitoring stations reported that more than 40 % of the water quality concentrations exceeded the class IV level. There were 21, 50, 36, and 21 monitoring stations that recorded significantly decreasing trends for BOD5, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP, respectively, and 39 monitoring stations showed a significantly increasing trend for DO. Moreover, the water quality concentrations had a certain concentricity and volatility according to boxplot analysis for the 20 monitoring stations. The majority of monitoring stations recorded a large fluctuation for the monitoring indexes in 2003 and 2004, which indicated that the water quality concentrations were unstable. According to the seasonal variations of the water quality concentrations in the mainstream of Huaihe River, the monthly variation trends of the BOD5, CODMn, DO, NH3-N, and TP concentrations were basically consistent among the seven monitoring stations. The BOD5, CODMn, NH3 -N, and TP concentrations were affected by the change of the stream discharge; changes in DO and NH3-N concentrations were influenced by the regional environmental temperature, and the DO and NH3-N concentrations decreased when the water temperature increased.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2016	188	9								10.1007/s10661-016-5503-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5503-0								27531013					WOS:000383128100025

This study investigated the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the BCC (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) and functional traits (FT, carbon-source utilization), and the contribution of: (i) environmental variables, (ii) phytoplankton, (iii) season, and (iv) space, through variance partitioning in the large and well-mixed Lake Mangueira. The BCC and FT differed in time and space, with BCC being explained by environmental variables and phytoplankton, whereas FT was explained only by space. The smallest scale of variability detected by the BCC and FT (similar to 49 km) was larger than scales found in the other studies, suggesting an effect of lake size (fetch and connectivity). Our results indicate that barriers to bacterial dispersal due to long distances are overcome by high connectivity, reinforcing the role of species sorting for BCC.

The net lake level drop during our study period is similar to 3 m with seasonal variations of more than 1 m. The time-series close to the lake center shows a high correlation with the lake level history. Near the lake center the unit response with respect to lake level change is 2.5 minim in radar line-of-sight direction, or similar to 2.7 mm/yr in vertical direction, corresponding to a vertical response of similar to 4.3 mm/Gt load change. We show that the observations are most sensitive to the elastic properties of the crust in the 5-15 km depth range and explain them with a layered elastic half-space model with a Young's modulus of 50 +/- 9 GPa Young's modulus in the top 15 km of the crust and using moduli inferred from seismology at greater depth. The inferred Young's modulus is similar to 25% smaller than the seismic modulus, which we attribute to damaged rock and the presence of fluids. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sun-stirred Kraken Mare: Circulation in Titan's seas induced by solar heating and methane precipitation	ICARUS												Density-driven circulation in Titan's seas forced by solar heating and methane evaporation/precipitation is simulated by an ocean circulation model. If the sea is transparent to sunlight, solar heating can induce anti-clockwise gyres near the sea surface and clockwise gyres near the sea bottom. The gyres are in geostrophic balance between the radially symmetric pressure gradient force and Coriolis force. If instead the sea is turbid and most sunlight is absorbed near the sea surface, the sea gets stratified in warm seasons and the circulation remains weak. Precipitation causes compositional stratification of the sea to an extent that the sea surface temperature can be lower than the sea interior temperature without causing a convective overturning. Non-uniform precipitation can also generate a latitudinal gradient in the methane mole fraction and density, which drives a meridional overturning with equatorward currents near the sea surface and poleward currents near the sea bottom. However, gyres are more ubiquitous than meridional overturning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analysis of changes over 44 years in the phytoplankton of Lake Vrtsjarv (Estonia): the effect of nutrients, climate and the investigator on phytoplankton-based water quality indices	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					We analysed long-term changes in phytoplankton composition in relation to hydrological, meteorological and nutrient loading data in the large (270 km(2)) shallow (mean depth 2.8 m) Lake Vrtsjarv. Nutrient loads to the lake were heavy in the 1970s and 1980s and decreased considerably thereafter. The average nutrient concentrations for 1985-2004 (1.6 mg l(-1) of total nitrogen and 53 mu g l(-1) of total phosphorus) characterize the lake as a eutrophic water body. All four calculated taxonomic indices showed a unidirectional deterioration of the lake's ecological status, despite reduced concentrations of nutrients. We focused our analysis on the PTSI index, which revealed a stepwise change between the years 1977 and 1979 that coincided with a large increase in water level, but also with a change of investigator. After correcting input data for possible investigator-induced differences, the step change remained because it was caused by major changes in the whole phytoplankton community. The previous dominant Planktolyngbya limnetica was replaced by two species of seasonally altering Limnothrix. Among phytoplankton functional groups, there was a decrease in all groups comprising small-sized phytoplankton species, such as X1, E, F, J, N and an increase in S1 and H1, both represented by filamentous cyanobacteria. Our results suggest a non-linear response of phytoplankton to changing nutrient loadings, and that the change observed between 1977 and 1979 was a regime shift triggered by water level change. High shade tolerance of the new dominants, and their ability to create shade, obviously stabilized the new status making it resistant to restoration efforts.

In order to assess the suitability of flash flood deposits as proxies for land degradation, we monitored a representative gully segment in North Ethiopia (Ashenge catchment), investigated a sequence of alluvial debris fans downstream of this segment and dated a neighbouring subaquatic debris fan using short-lived Pb-210 isotope counting. During one rainy season (July-September 2014), we measured daily rainfall, peak discharge, bedload transport, suspended sediment load and sediment deposition rates. The data show that sediment deposition in the debris fans is significantly dependent on micro-topography (net incision in micro-channels) (p<01) and position within the sequence (net incision farther away from the lake) (p<005). As sediment transfer to the lake significantly depends on the balance between available water and sediment (ratio rainfall depth/bedload transport) (p<005), we could reconstruct the hydro-sedimentary evolution of the gully over the past half century and validate it with aerial photographs and semi-structured interviews. The findings are consistent with the short-lived isotope count results, indicating increased sediment supply from the 1970s onwards, when little amounts of clay were deposited in the lake (<5%), and a subrecent clear water effect that resulted in increased deposition rates of clay in the lacustrine debris fan. Overall, our analysis indicates that debris fan sediments can be used to estimate past environmental degradation rates, if the contemporary water and sediment behaviour is well understood.

However, WQI calculation methods are not uniform, especially the selection of water parameters and the weighting given to each water parameter (Pi). To optimize WQI calculation, 132 water samples from seven rivers and from Chaohu Lake (33 sampling sites in Chaohu Lake Basin) in four seasons were collected, and the water parameters and microbiota composition were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rDNA. The correlation coefficient R2 between water parameters and microbiota composition using redundancy analysis with the Monte Carlo method were calculated, and the water parameters that significantly correlated with the microbiota composi-tion were selected to calculate WQImin. The results showed that TP, COD, DO, and Chl a correlated significantly with water microbiota composition. WQIb calculated by substituting R2 for Pi was more consistent with the similarity between the microbiota compositions. WQIminb calculated using TP, COD, and DO was consistent with WQIb. The results of WQIb and WQIminb were more consistent than those of WQI and WQImin. These results imply that using R2 instead of Pi could help obtain a more stable WQIb that could better reflect the biological characteristics of the Chaohu Lake Basin.

Maurice			Observations of River Solute Concentrations during Ice Formation	ACS ES&T WATER												It has been observed in some aquatic systems, such as lakes and oceans, that when ice forms solutes are excluded from the ice, increasing their concentrations in the water. This process, known as solute ice exclusion, could be important in rivers and streams where ice can be a significant fraction of the total volume, potentially significantly increasing chemical concentrations in the water. There have been no reported observations of solute dynamics during ice formation in rivers and streams, however, even though the freeze-thaw cycle is a common phenomenon for lotic systems in cold regions. To investigate this process, a variety of solutes were measured during three ice formation events in a mine-waste-polluted river in western Montana. A laboratory study was also conducted to determine how different metal cations partition when ice forms. It was found that solute concentrations significantly increase during the early stages of ice formation. Correlations with ion size and changes in temperature support the idea that ice exclusion was controlling solute dynamics during these periods. These observations could have important implications for predicting the environmental impacts of toxic solutes in rivers and streams subject to seasonal ice formation.					; Colman, Benjamin/AGJ-4864-2022	DeGrandpre, Michael/0000-0003-1969-6709; Valett, H.

Differential water and soil conservation capacity and associated processes in four forest ecosystems in Dianchi Watershed, Yunnan Province, China	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The soil and water conservation capacity of forest ecosystems is closely associated with precipitation, runoff, sediment delivery, and the export of the nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from forest soil. Research has investigated the potential for decreasing runoff pollution from watersheds by improving the function of forest ecosystems in conserving soil and water. Four typical forest ecological systems, including Pinus armandii forest, Yunnan pine forest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, and broad-leaved forest, were compared for vegetation community structure and species diversity; water-holding capacity in canopy, litter and soil layers; and the relationship with surface runoff and the export of sediment, N, and P during the 2013 rainy season. The species number and species richness were in the range of 10 to 22 and 4.68 to 7.94, respectively. The Shannon-Wiener Index, Simpson Index, and Pielou Index were 0.95 to 1.67, 0.43 to 0.68, and 0.50 to 1.04, respectively. Canopy interception rate increased with decreasing precipitation. The linear correlation equation of the two parameters was described as I = -2.768x + 64.318, where I = the canopy interception rate (mm) and x = rainfall amount (mm). The broad-leaved forest had the greatest interception rate because of its dense canopy. Litter storage in the four forest ecosystems ranged from 7.31 to 11.98 t ha(-1) (6,527 to 10,698 lb ac(-1)); the highest litter yield was found in the broad-leaved forest. In this ecosystem, both the undecomposed and semidecomposed litter had the most water retention capacity (14.02 t ha(-1) [12,519 lb ac(-1)] and 14.71 t ha(-1) [13,136 lb ac(-1)], respectively) and effective water interception rate (8.18 t ha(-1) [7,304 lb ac(-1)] and 9.01 t ha(-1) [8,045 lb ac(-1)], respectively). In the 0 to 60 cm (0 to 23.6 in) soil layer, the broad-leaved forest had the greatest soil field capacity of 188.80 t ha(-1) (168,598 lb ac(-1)) and 18.88 mm (0.74 in) water depth equivalent. The amount of surface runoff, sediment yield, and export of N and P increased with rainfall amounts, but the four forest ecosystems differed significantly in these properties. The ranges of sediment yield and export of total N and P were 13.1 to 344.2, 0.16 to 1.55, and 0.02 to 0.10 mg m(-2), respectively. The broad-leaved forest formed an extremely dense canopy and had the highest maximum water-holding capacity, porosity, and soil field capacity. These properties made this ecosystem highly suitable for decreasing surface runoff and the export of sediments, N, and P from the forest soil.

Climatic changes in western North America, 1950-2005	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The rate of climatic change over western North America (WNA) is quantified for 485 climate stations for the period 19502005. Additionally, six stations with quality long-term records were selected and analysed for the period 19062005. The indicators used were developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the World Climate Research Program's Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI). From the 27 core indices, 4 temperature-based and 4 precipitation-based indicators were selected for in-depth analysis. The 8 million km2 study area is comprised of the 22 contiguous US states and 4 Canadian provinces west of the Mississippi River and Great Lakes. The results were divided into six general regions for interpretation and presentation. GIS interpolation of station-specific statistical output was completed to further aid in the identification of spatially coherent trends across WNA. Mean slopes were calculated over the whole study area, and by region, for each index, and then tested to determine if they were significantly different from zero. Results of the study show statistically significant historical climate trends across the study area. As expected in a region as geographically diverse as WNA, results differed between, and within, regions. Overall, temperature-based indicators showed a general warming trend over the entire study area, with the greatest increases along the North American Cordillera. The trends in precipitation-based indicators were more varied. General trends indicate moderately increasing precipitation volume and intensity over much of WNA. The strongest precipitation trends were found in areas with climate largely controlled by air masses originating over the Gulf of Mexico.

"Dead Zone" dynamics in Lake Erie: the importance of weather and sampling intensity for calculated hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Calculated hypolimnetic oxygen depletion (HOD) rates depend not only on environmental factors but also logistical ones. In particular, lack of understanding of the effects of weather in addition to how sampling effort determines calculated HOD rates complicates ecological understanding and environmental management of lake ecosystems. To better determine the roles of weather and sampling effort, we combined (1) weekly measurements of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from seven stations in the Sandusky subbasin of Lake Erie's central basin during 2005, (2) contemporaneous measures of storm activity and tributary discharge, and (3) a two-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic, chemical, and biological model of Lake Erie to investigate (1) how increased storm activity and tributary discharge affected short- (daily) and long-term (seasonal) dynamics of hypolimnetic hypoxia, and (2) how spatial (number of sites sampled) and temporal (sampling frequency) sampling effort affected calculated HOD rates. Our model closely replicated field-observed DO dynamics. When comparing baseline modeled dynamics to those in a second simulation with twice the number of days with high winds, however, we found that with more storm activity (1) periods of entrainment became more frequent, (2) the hypolimnion was warmer, (3) thermal stratification occurred 1 month later, whereas autumnal turnover occurred at least 1 week earlier shortening the duration of stratification by 1-2 months, and (4) HOD rates increased 12%. Further, spatial and temporal sampling intensity also affected calculated HOD rates. Consequently, adequately quantifying actual HOD rates requires sufficient sampling effort and the particular role of weather should be assessed with rigorous field and simulation studies, especially if HOD rates are used to indicate management success.

A paucity of lake-wide turbulence measurements hinders our ability to assess how representative such budgets are at the basin scale. Using an autonomous underwater glider equipped with a microstructure payload, we explored the spatial variability of turbulence in pelagic and near-shore regions of Lake Geneva. Dissipation rates of kinetic energy and thermal variance were estimated by fitting temperature gradient fluctuations spectra to the Batchelor spectrum. In deep waters, turbulent dissipation rates in the surface and thermocline were mild (similar to 10(-8) W kg(-1)) and weakened toward the hypolimnion (similar to 10(-11) to 10(-10) W kg(-1)). The seasonal thermocline exhibited inhibited interior mixing, with extremely low values of mixing efficiency (Ri(f) << 0.1). In contrast, in the slope zone, a band of significantly enhanced energy dissipation (similar to 5 x 10(-8) W kg(-1)) extended well above the bottom boundary layer and was associated with strong, efficient mixing (Ri(f) > 0.17). The resulting contribution of the slope region to basin-scale mixing was large, with 90% of the basin-wide mixing-and only 30% energy dissipation-occurring within 4 km of the shoreline. This boundary mixing will modify overturning circulation and the transport pathways of dissolved compounds exchanged with the sediments. The dynamics responsible for the shift in the mixing regime, which appears crucial for the mixing budget of lakes, could not be fully unraveled with the collected observations. Additional model data analyses hint at the role of submesoscale instabilities.					; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Sepúlveda Steiner, Oscar/IZE-0774-2023; Castro, Bieito/AAM-9763-2021	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; McInerney, Jasmin Beatrice Tredoux/0000-0003-4202-1750; Forrest, Alexander/0000-0002-7853-9765; Lavanchy, Sebastien/0000-0002-7417-8587; Fernandez Castro, Bieito/0000-0001-7797-854X; SEPULVEDA STEINER, Oscar/0000-0001-7919-0297; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2023	128	6							e2022JC018913	10.1029/2022JC018913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC018913													WOS:001006252600001
J	Etzeoglou, R				Etzeoglou, Rodoniki			"ΕΓΡΑΦΗ ΕΝ ΤΩ ΜΥΖΙΘΡΑ" BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACTIVITIES AT MISTRA DURING THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES	DELTION OF THE CHRISTIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The city of Mistra, which was founded in the years following 1262, received the special attention of the central authority and was organized in direct dependence on the Capital. The bibliographical activities in Mistra are placed within the framework of this policy, as is demonstrated by the extant manuscripts dating to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Their examination leads to the following observations: a) they fall into two groups with an interval between them: 1289-1319 and 1362-1372; b) they are connected with the presence at Mistra of certain personalities from Constantinople; c) the two groups are differentiated in terms of content; copying of ecclesiastical works prevails in the first group, while the second group is characterized by the pre-dominance of ancient Greek authors as well as the transcription of works relating to religious-philosophical quests of the period; d) there is also a differentiation in quality, since the second period is marked by the presence of a scholarly emperor and of a renowned scribe. The dominant figure in the first period is Nikephoros Moschopoulos, a man of letters as well as bibliophile prelate, who was Metropolitan of Lakedaimonia from 1288/9 to 1315/6. Nikephoros is the patron of three codices, two of which have been written by the scribe Georgios, working in his service, while Nikephoros himself took part in the writing of the third codex (Milan, Bibl. Ambrosiana. 34 sup.; Paris, Bibl. Nationale, Par. suppl.gr. 1175; Cesena, Bibl. Malatestiana D. XXVII. 2). Moreover, Nikephoros Moschopoulos brought from Conastantinople two codices, which he dedicated to ecclesiastical foundations of Mistra ( Oxford, Bodleian Library, Holkham gr.6; Moscow, Historical Mus., Syn.gr.225). In the same period three more codices were written by the priest and protekdikos of the Metropolis of Lakedaimonia, Nikolaos Malotaras ( Bibl. Escoriai Omega-II-5; Athens, National Library no. 2550; Venice, Istituto Hellenico no. 4), while another one by the nomikos Basilakis ( Par. gr. 708). These codices were patroned by Pachomios, abbot of the Brontochion Monastery, and Ioannis Polemianitis, a nobleman and relative of the emperor Andronikos II. The manuscripts of this group contain ecclesiastical works ( Gospels, Homilies, ascetic texts) except for one, namely Homer's Odyssey, belonging to Nikephoros Moschopoulos. The manuscripts of the second group all bear the signature of the well known Constantinopolitan scribe Manuel Tzy-kandyles, who came to Mistra at the behest of former emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. Of the seven extant codices dating to this period, three contain works of John Kantakouzenos ( Par. gr. 1241; Meteora Monastery of Holy Trinity no. 1; Vat. gr. 674), while the remaining four include works by Plutarch, Xenophon and Thucydides ( Bodleian, Can. gr. 93; Ambrosiana D 538 inf.; Munich, State Library no. 451; Vat. gr. 127). Demetrios Kasandrenos, a distinguisched nobleman from Constantinople who followed John Kantakouzenos in Mistra, and Manuel Kantakouzenos, Despot of the Peloponnsse, are mentioned as patrons of these codices. A distinguishing feature of the manuscripts by Tzykandyles studied here, is the fact that the place of writing is noted on the colophon (epsilon gamma rho alpha phi eta epsilon nu tau omega Mu nu zeta iota theta rho alpha = written in Mistra). This feature is not encountered in the manuscripts written by him in Constantinople prior to 1362, whereas it occurs in a manuscript dating to 1374, i.e. after his return to Constantinople (epsilon gamma rho alpha phi eta epsilon nu tau eta Kappa omega nu omicron tau alpha nu tau iota nu omicron pi omicron lambda epsilon iota= written in Constantinople). On the basis of the above, and given the correct reading of the date in the colophon of cod. Par. gr. 135, doubts are expressed concerning what has hitherto been published as regards the writing and illumination of this particular codex at Mistra. This manuscript, containing the book of Job with scholia, and illuminated with 198 miniatures, exhibits strong Western influences and bears in the colophon the signature of Tzykandyles, without the place of writing, and the year 6870, which corresponds to the year 1362. However, damage in the position of the month does not allow for a precise dating within the interval September 1361 and March 1362. Moreover, there is no evidence that Tzykandyles was at Mistra during this period, since the earliest manuscript with the indication epsilon gamma rho alpha phi eta epsilon nu tau omega Mu nu zeta iota theta rho alpha(= written in Mistra) bears the exact date 7 April 1362 (Ambrosian, D. 538 inf.). In view of the above and given the fact that at this period there were organized colonial communities of Italian cities in the capital of the Empire, it may be surmised that Par. gr. 135 was written and illuminated in Constantinople prior to Tzykandyles journey to Mistra.																			1105-5758	2241-2190					2005		26					181	192		10.12681/dchae.439	http://dx.doi.org/10.12681/dchae.439													WOS:000409581200017
J	Huang, JP; Li, Z				Huang, Juping; Li, Zhe			Carbon emissions affected by real-time reservoir operation: a hydrodynamic modeling approach coupled with air-water mass transfer	WATER RESEARCH												Air-water diffusive carbon fluxes (e.g., CO2 and CH4) in reservoirs, particularly those dammed in river valleys, are the major pathway of reservoir carbon emissions. Hydrodynamic conditions caused by real-time reservoir operation could potentially affect air-water transfer of these greenhouse gases (GHGs), yet still under explored. Here, we proposed an estimation method of gross carbon emissions based on a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling approach. The model assumed that air-water mass transfer was primarily regulated by surface turbulence, and disregarded contributions from biogeochemical processes as well as seasonality of meteoro-logical parameters (i.e., wind speed and direction; air temperature). Through the hydrodynamic modeling, reservoir water level, flow velocity, surface turbulence, and air-water transfer velocity of carbon fluxes were elaborated. Gross carbon emissions were integrated by the carbon fluxes in each discrete cell and time under real-time reservoir operation. The Xiangjiaba Reservoir (XJB), located in the upper Yangtze Basin, was selected as the case of the study. Based on daily hydrological data in 2018, such as reservoir inflow, outflow and water level, the gross CO2 and CH4 emissions in the reservoir were approximately 6.7 Gg and 5.6 Mg. Variations of daily water level and discharge induced by reservoir operation could evidently affect carbon emissions. In particular, when reservoir initiated its impoundment, the discharge could be the probably critical factor that affected mass transfer velocity and carbon emissions in the reservoir. Our model could provide a new vision for evaluating the effect of real-time reservoir operation on carbon emissions.

Water, sediments, plankton, fish, and human samples from Grande Marsh, a Hg-polluted marsh located in the south of Bolivar, municipality of Montecristo, Colombia, were collected during both the rainy and the dry seasons (2003-2006), at three different sampling sites, and analyzed for total Hg (T-Hg) content. Water, sediment, seston, phytoplankton, and zooplankton T-Hg concentrations were 0.33 +/- 0.03 mu g/L, 0.71 +/- 0.03, 1.20 +/- 0.06, 0.52 +/- 0.03, and 0.94 +/- 0.05 mu g/g dry weight (wt), respectively. T-Hg levels in these compartments were highly pair-correlated (p < 0.05), and for all of them, except sediments, greater values were found during the dry season. Significant differences were observed for T-Hg concentrations in fish according to their trophic position. Average highest T-Hg values were found in carnivorous species such as Caquetaia kraussi (1.09 +/- 0.17 mu g/g fresh wt), Hoplias malabaricus (0.58 +/- 0.05 mu g/g fresh wt), and Plagioscion surinamensis (0.53 +/- 0.07 mu g/g fresh wt), whereas the lowest were detected in noncarnivorous species such as Prochilodus magdalenae (0.157 +/- 0.01 mu g/g fresh wt). In those fish species where seasonal comparisons were possible, specimens captured during the dry season had greater T-Hg levels in muscle. Although the T-Hg mean level for all fish samples (0.407 +/- 0.360 mu g/g fresh wt) did not exceed the recommended limit ingestion level, risk assessment based on the hazard index suggested that a fish intake of 0.12 kg per day (a small carnivorous specimen) could increase the potential health effects related to Hg exposure in the local human population, whose hair T-Hg median value was 4.7 mu g/g, and presented a low but significant correlation with fish consumption (r = 0.250, p = 0.016). In short, Hg pollution from gold mining around Grande Marsh has permeated the food web, and currently levels in fish represent a serious concern for human health.

The Lujiao-Luosan section is the connecting section of Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River, and the hydrological data for this section over the past 70 years has been analyzed. It has been found that the lowest water level is consistently rising at the same discharge at Chenglingji station, which is the joint point of Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. While this could alleviate the drought situation in the Dongting Lake area during dry seasons, it could pose a more significant flood-control challenge during high water levels in the flood season. The water surface slope shows a decreasing trend especially during the dry season, except for the high flood period (July-September), which indicates that the water slope in the connecting section of Dongting Lake has become flatter. The backwater effect of the Yangtze River on Dongting Lake becomes increasingly stronger as the water surface slope difference between the Chenglingji-Luoshan section and the Lujiao-Chenglingji section changes from negative to positive between January and April.

We investigated whether the forms of phosphorus (P) in rivers with high effluent loads flowing through urban areas of Sapporo, Japan, were transformed when transported downstream into a eutrophic lake, namely Lake Barato. We hypothesized that the inorganic P supplied from the rivers might be transformed to organic forms in the lake. The results showed that soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP) dominated in the river discharge to the lake. Suspended solids in the rivers were rich in iron (Fe) so PIP was associated with Fe. A comparison of the concentrations at the river mouth and 4.5 km downstream showed that the concentrations of SRP and PIP were lower at 4.5 km downstream than at the river mouth, whereas the concentrations of organic P (i.e., dissolved organic phosphorus and particulate organic phosphorus) were similar. The results from solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of lake water showed that pyrophosphate was only present in the particulate fraction, while orthophosphate diesters (DNA-P) were only present in the dissolved fraction. Riverine samples contained orthophosphate (ortho-P) only, while lake samples contained ortho-P, orthophosphate monoesters, and DNA-P. The results suggest that the P forms, particularly those of dissolved P, shifted from inorganic to organic forms as the water was discharged from the river to the lake.

A review of habitat and biodiversity research in Lake Nokoue, Benin Republic: Current state of knowledge and prospects for further research	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												A systematic literature review was undertaken to understand the state and relationship between habitat types and biodiversity in the open coastal Lake Nokoue and to analyse the research gaps towards an efficient management of this ecosystem. Habitat types in Lake Nokoue have been profoundly impacted by the urbanisation around the lake. Kilometres of riparian habitat including mangrove vegetation were destroyed on the south and western shoreline of the lake, removing the natural protection of the ecosystem to the increasing sewage nutrient load. In addition, to this anthropogenic pressure, the solid wastes from the villages on stilts (Ganvie's villages) increased the nutrient enrichment of the lake. Consequently, the lake experience a seasonal bloom of water hyacinth which dies and sinks to its bottom each year when the salinity rises above 6 ppt. Note that the salinity dynamics of the lake is governed by its hydrological regime which was highly affected by the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960. In addition to these changes, the intensification of the acadja fishing practice has led to the exportation of tonnes of dry woods into the lake. The decay of these woods combined with the accumulation of hyacinth detritus has disturbed the habitats of macroinvertebrates and fish. There is a progressive shift in the system from freshwater species to marine water species and from insectivorous fish to detritivorous fish. Management solutions required reduction of both detritus accumulation and external nutrient load. (C) 2018 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

The aim of this study was to investigate the etiology of CNS infections in a rural area of Nepal using molecular methods. From November 2014 to February 2016, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from 176 consecutive patients presenting at United Mission Hospital in Tansen, Nepal, with symptoms of possible CNS infection. After the CSF samples were stored and transported frozen, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in Sweden, targeting a total of 26 pathogens using the FilmArray (R) ME panel (BioFire, bioMerieux, Salt Lake City, UT), the MeningoFinder (R) 2SMART(PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands), and an in-house PCR test for dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Nipah virus (NiV). The etiology could be determined in 23%. The bacteria detected were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 4), and Neisseria meningitidis (n = 1). The most common virus was enterovirus detected in eight samples, all during the monsoon season. Other viruses detected were cytomegalovirus (n = 6), varicella zoster virus (n = 5), Epstein-Barr virus (n = 3), herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) (n = 3), HSV-2 (n = 3), human herpes virus (HHV) type 6 (HHV-6) (n = 3), and HHV-7 (n = 2). Cryptococcus neoformans/gatti was found in four samples. None of the samples were positive for DENV, JEV, or NiV. Of the patients, 67% had been exposed to antibiotics before lumbar puncture. In conclusion, the etiology could not be found in 77% of the samples, indicating that the commercial PCR panels used are not suitable in this setting. Future studies on the etiology of CNS infections in Nepal could include metagenomic techniques.

J	Suriano, ZJ				Suriano, Zachary J.			On the role of snow cover ablation variability and synoptic-scale atmospheric forcings at the sub-basin scale within the Great Lakes watershed	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions play a critical role in determining the frequency and intensity of snow cover ablation in the mid-latitudes. Using a synoptic classification technique, distinct regional circulation patterns influencing the Great Lakes basin of North America are identified and examined in conjunction with daily snow ablation events from 1960 to 2009. This approach allows for the influence of each synoptic weather type on ablation to be examined independently and for the monthly and inter-annual frequencies of the weather types to be tracked over time. Because of the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover and the relatively large geographic extent of the Great Lakes basin, snow cover ablation events and the synoptic-scale patterns that cause them are examined for each of the Great Lakes watershed's five primary sub-basins to understand the regional complexities of snow cover ablation variability. Results indicate that while many synoptic weather patterns lead to ablation across the basins, they can be generally grouped into one of only a few primary patterns: southerly flow, high-pressure overhead, and rain-on-snow patterns. As expected, the patterns leading to ablation are not necessarily consistent between the five sub-basins due to the seasonality of snow cover and the spatial variability of temperature, moisture, wind, and incoming solar radiation associated with the particular synoptic weather types. Significant trends in the inter-annual frequency of ablation-inducing synoptic types do exist for some sub-basins, indicating a potential change in the hydrologic impact of these patterns over time.

Biostratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental significance of Campanian-early Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous) ostracods from the Jiaozhou Formation of Zhucheng, Shandong, China	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												Cretaceous strata are well developed in the Jiaolai Basin (Jiaodong Peninsula, East China) and contain abundant fossils including hadrosaurids, tyrannosauroids, various types of dinosaur eggs, bivalves, gastropods, ostracods, clam shrimps, insects and plants. During a geological investigation in Zhucheng City, eastern Shandong Province, East China, a new exposure of part of the Jiaozhou Formation was discovered near Jiankou Village. This formation constitutes uppermost Cretaceous to earliest Paleogene strata (encompassing the K/Pg boundary) in the Jiaolai Basin. Samples from a new Jiankou section yielded abundant ostracods assigned to twelve genera and twenty-seven species, reported for the first time from the Jiaozhou Formation in this area. The assemblage is composed entirely of non-marine taxa, including species of Cypridea, Talicypridea and Candoniella. Ostracod biostratigraphy indicates this section to be Campanian to early Maastrichtian in age, but not including the K/Pg boundary commonly present in the upper part of the Jiaozhou Formation. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the species composition of the assemblages obtained, combined with a study of valve ornamentation, suggests that during the late Campanian, an ephemeral pond or small ephemeral lake alternated with a permanent lake in the studied area, and during the Campanian to Maastrichtian interval, there was a seasonally expanding and shrinking lake with both permanent and ephemeral basins in the studied area.

Significance of variable selection and scaling issues for probabilistic modeling of rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility	SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH												Identifying the input variables/attributes for probabilistic modeling of rainfall-induced landslides is critical for effective landslide susceptibility characterization. This study evaluates the capabilities of different attribute selectors available in Weka, an open source machine learning software, for identifying the most landslide-predictive combination of attributes. The study area is located in the Lake Atitlan watershed in Guatemala, which is highly susceptible to landslides during the rainy season. Landslide initiation points were delineated in the field as well as in the ortho-photos, which were taken following Hurricane Stan of October 2005. Two datasets spanning different sized areas were used to compare the success of attribute selectors and to determine if the model results from the smaller area could be successfully applied to the larger one. The Weka Bayesian network classification algorithm was used to evaluate the success of different attribute selection methods and to identify the combination of attributes with the highest rate of landslide prediction for the two study areas. Filtered subset proved to be the most successful in identifying the ideal combination for both the smaller and the larger scale datasets.

However, little is known about the interactions between successional and existing species of different growth forms, particularly under the low light and high nutrient conditions of eutrophic lakes. We measured the functional traits of mature Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara plants and Potamogeton crispus L. shoots in monoculture and mosaic patterns under different light and nutrient conditions. The effect of light on functional traits of the submerged macrophyte species was more significant than that of nutrients, but the reverse was true for P. crispus biomass allocation. Moreover, interspecific interactions affected only the submerged macrophytes under the low light condition and varied with species. Specifically, the interaction of P. crispus to V. natans was biased towards competition, while the interaction of V. natans to P. crispus was converted from facilitation to competition by eutrophication, particularly in the homogenous mosaic growth pattern. This study demonstrates that sufficient light is a prerequisite and patch planting is an effective means to form a multispecies submerged vegetation system. In addition, we emphasize that the coexistence of eutrophication and low light will likely result in a competition between submerged macrophytes thus simplifying the vegetation, even if their growth forms and growing seasons are different. These findings help explain the collapse of multispecies submerged vegetation and guide the restoration of aquatic plants in eutrophic lakes.

Localising and quantifying groundwater inflow into lakes using high-precision 222Rn profiles	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater-surface water interaction is a topic gaining increasing attention. Changes in the hydrological cycle due to climatic changes as well as loading of groundwater with nutrients and pollutants motivate a precise investigation of the coupling between groundwater and surface water. Freshwater reservoirs are especially vulnerable to changes in the quantity and quality of the inflowing water. Rn-222 can be used as a sensitive tracer for the investigation of the coupling between groundwater and lakes. So far, simple one or two box models have been used to determine a general estimate of the groundwater inflow. In this study, we introduce a multi-box model for the radon distribution in a lake which accounts for vertical inhomogeneity in the groundwater inflow and transport between the boxes. Measurements of precise concentration profiles during different states of stratification enabled the depth-resolved calculation of the groundwater inflow and the validation of previous mass balance calculations. Furthermore, the multi-box model yields the possibility to detect depth levels of enhanced or suppressed groundwater input and to trace seasonal changes in the interstratification of groundwater in the lake. Additionally, the depth-dependent calculation helps to constrain several parameters in the Rn mass balance. For example, it provides an upper limit for the diffusive radon sediment flux and constrains the estimate of the gas exchange with the atmosphere. Exemplary data from the studied lake show the groundwater inflow to be restricted to a limited layer (upper 5 m) whereas the groundwater interstratification signal and depth varies with stratification pattern in the water column. The average inflow rate determined from the multi-box model (440 +/- 140 m(3) d(-1)) agrees with previous one-box model calculations (390 +/- 410 m(3) d(-1)), however, the new approach is more precise and yields substantially more information about the system.

Soil carbon fluxes and stocks in a Great Lakes forest chronosequence	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We measured soil respiration and soil carbon stocks, as well as micrometeorological variables in a chronosequence of deciduous forests in Wisconsin and Michigan. The chronosequence consisted of (1) four recently disturbed stands, including a clearcut and repeatedly burned stand (burn), a blowdown and partial salvage stand (blowdown), a clearcut with sparse residual overstory (residual), and a regenerated stand from a complete clearcut (regenerated); (2) four young aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands in average age of 10 years; (3) four intermediate aspen stands in average age of 26 years; (4) four mature northern hardwood stands in average age of 73 years; and (5) an old-growth stand approximately 350-years old. We fitted site-based models and used continuous measurements of soil temperature to estimate cumulative soil respiration for the growing season of 2005 (days 133-295). Cumulative soil respiration in the growing season was estimated to be 513, 680, 747, 747, 794, 802, 690, and 571 g C m(-2) in the burn, blowdown, residual, regenerated, young, intermediate, mature, and old-growth stands, respectively. The measured apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration was the highest in the regenerated stand, and declined from the young stands to the old-growth. Both, cumulative soil respiration and basal soil respiration at 10 degrees C, increased during stand establishment, peaked at intermediate age, and then decreased with age. Total soil carbon at 0-60 cm initially decreased after harvest, and increased after stands established. The old-growth stand accumulated carbon in deep layers of soils, but not in the surface soils. Our study suggests a complexity of long-term soil carbon dynamics, both in vertical depth and temporal scale.

J	Bondarenko, OV; Utescher, T				Bondarenko, Olesya, V; Utescher, Torsten			Late early to early middle Eocene climate and vegetation change at Tastakh Lake (northern Yakutia, eastern Siberia)	PALAEOBIODIVERSITY AND PALAEOENVIRONMENTS												The late early - early middle Eocene climate and vegetation evolution in northern Yakutia (Eastern Siberia) is quantitatively studied in detail for the first time, based on a palaeobotanical record. Palaeobotanical data for this time interval were obtained from 16 palynofloras from continental sediments on the southern shore of Tastakh Lake (the left bank of Indigirka River). In this first integrative study, we applied the Coexistence Approach for quantification of palaeoclimate, the Plant Functional Type (PFT) approach and Integrated Plant Record (IPR) vegetation analysis to quantify palaeovegetation. Our investigation documents the persistence of warm temperate and, at times, nearly tropical climate conditions in the earlier part of the record and the subsequent onset of a cooling trend. Overall humid climate conditions prevailed throughout the late early - early middle Eocene. Our reconstruction indicates low temperature seasonality and relatively strong seasonality in precipitation. Vegetation data as reconstructed are in good agreement with the climate evolution. PFT diversity spectra indicate the prevalence of mixed evergreen-deciduous forests of warm temperate character. The IPR method suggests that the mixed mesophytic forest biome persisted throughout the studied sedimentary succession. The presence of mangroves in our late early Eocene records (at the base of the section) is largely in line with our climate reconstruction and possibly can be related to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) hyperthermal event.

J	Hurley, T; Mazumder, A				Hurley, Tim; Mazumder, Asit			Spatial scale of land-use impacts on riverine drinking source water quality	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Drinking water purveyors are increasingly relying on land conservation and management to ensure the safety of the water that they provide to consumers. To cost-effectively implement any such landscape initiatives, resources must be targeted to the appropriate spatial scale to address quality impairments of concern in a cost-effective manner. Using data gathered from 40 Canadian rivers across four ecozones, we examined the spatial scales at which land use was most closely associated with drinking source water quality metrics. Exploratory linear mixed-effects models accounting for climatic, hydrological, and physiographic variation among sites suggested that different spatial areas of land-use influence drinking source water quality depending on the parameter and season investigated. Escherichia coli spatial variability was only associated with land use at a local (5-10 km) spatial scale. Turbidity measures exhibited a complex association with land use, suggesting that the land-use areas of greatest influence can range from a 1 km subcatchment to the entire watershed depending on the season. Total organic carbon concentrations were only associated with land use characterized at the entire watershed scale. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index was used to calculate a composite measure of seasonal drinking source water quality but did not provide additional information beyond the analyses of individual parameters. These results suggest that entire watershed management is required to safeguard drinking water sources with more focused efforts at targeted spatial scales to reduce specific risk parameters.

J	Ginatullina, E; Atwell, L; Saito, L				Ginatullina, Elena; Atwell, Lisa; Saito, Laurel			Resilience and resistance of zooplankton communities to drought-induced salinity in freshwater and saline lakes of Central Asia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Effects of drought-induced salinity changes on aquatic communities are less studied in lentic than in lotic systems. We present changes in zooplankton assemblages from five arid lakes before, during, and after a supra-seasonal drying event in which lake inflow ceased in 2001. We catalogued zooplankton communities in fresh and saline lakes of the Sudochye wetland in Central Asia. During this record low flow period, salinity increased in the lakes. Zooplankton species richness was inversely correlated with salinity. Linear regression using species richness indicated that zooplankton communities in the two least saline lakes were strongly correlated with changes in salinity. Post-drought recovery of species richness suggested resilience to this perturbation. Both saline lakes' zooplankton communities had low correlation with changes in salinity, suggesting greater resistance than the freshwater communities. The fifth lake showed a hybrid response, beginning in the fresh range, but experiencing higher salinities than the other fresh lakes. In the fifth lake species-richness was similarly correlated to changes in salinity as compared to the saline lakes, correlation of % halotolerant species was intermediate between saline and fresh communities, and post-drought species richness was similar to the fresh lakes, which could indicate a "resilient" recovery of species richness.

J	Nepal, V; Fabrizio, MC; Lavaud, R; van der Meer, J				Nepal, Vaskar; Fabrizio, Mary C.; Lavaud, Romain; van der Meer, Jaap			Bioenergetic strategies contributing to the invasion success of blue catfish	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus is an invasive species in many lakes and coastal rivers of the eastern United States. Due to high population densities and negative effects on native species, the potential for blue catfish to invade and colonize aquatic ecosystems is a key management concern. In addition, managers are interested in understanding the efficacy of harvest removals for controlling population sizes of blue catfish in these systems. These issues would benefit from identification of the eco-physiological mechanisms and strategies that contribute to the establishment and spread of this species in novel environments. In this study, we developed a full life-cycle bioenergetics model for blue catfish based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. We found that blue catfish have low maintenance costs but relatively high reserve capacity, two traits that help explain the success of this invasive species. Specifically, blue catfish seem well adapted for life in low and spatially or temporally patchy food conditions, such that individuals can mature and potentially reproduce even when food levels are as low as 13 % of maximum. Blue catfish may thus outcompete native species in many habitats, including those in estuarine systems. Moreover, blue catfish allocate a large fraction (42 %) of assimilated energy towards reproductive processes. Changes in food availability due to competition can have substantial compensatory effects on the age and size at first reproduction, maximum size, and reproduction rates of blue catfish. At seasonal scales, however, the reproductive output of large individuals is relatively insensitive to food availability during the spawning season. Managers seeking to reduce the abundance of the species in estuarine habitats via increased harvest must consider the metabolic capabilities of blue catfish, along with dynamic density-dependent processes that contribute to increased production of blue catfish in response to lower abundances.

Legacy radionuclides in cryoconite and proglacial sediment on Orwell Glacier, Signy Island, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Cryoconite is a specific type of material found on the surface of glaciers and icesheets. Samples of cryoconite were collected from the Orwell Glacier and its moraines, together with suspended sediment from the proglacial stream on Signy Island, part of the South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. The activity concentrations of certain fallout radionuclides were determined in the cryoconite, moraine and suspended sediment, in addition to particle size composition and %C and %N. For cryoconite samples (n = 5), mean activity concentrations (& PLUSMN;1SD) of 137Cs, 210Pbun and 241Am were 13.2 & PLUSMN; 20.9, 66.1 & PLUSMN; 94.0 and 0.32 & PLUSMN; 0.64 Bq kg- 1, respectively. Equivalent values for the moraine samples (n = 7) were 2.56 & PLUSMN; 2.75, 14.78 & PLUSMN; 12.44 and <1.0 Bq kg- 1, respectively. For the composite suspended sediment sample, collected over 3 weeks in the ablation season, the values (& PLUSMN; counting uncertainty) for 137Cs, 210Pbun and 241Am were 2.64 & PLUSMN; 0.88, 49.2 & PLUSMN; 11.9 and <1.0 Bq kg- 1, respectively. Thus, fallout radionuclide activity concentrations were elevated in cryoconite relative to moraine and suspended sediment. In the case of 40K, the highest value was for the suspended sediment (1423 & PLUSMN; 166 Bq kg- 1). The fallout radionuclides in cryoconite were 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than values in soils collected from other locations in Antarctica. This work further demonstrates that cryoconite likely scavenges fallout radionuclides (dissolved and particulate) in glacial meltwater. In the case of 40K, the greater value in suspended sediment implies a subglacial source. These results are amongst the relatively few that demonstrate the presence of fallout radionuclides in cryoconites at remote locations in the Southern Hemisphere. This work adds to the growing contention that elevated activities of fallout radionuclides, and other contaminants, in cryoconites are a global phenomenon and may be a risk to downstream terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Delivery of nutrients and seston from the Muskegon River Watershed to near shore Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Drowned river mouth lakes are major features of coastal Great Lakes habitats and may influence nutrient and organic matter contributions from watersheds to near shore coastal zones. In May through October 2003, we measured loads of nutrients, surficial sediment, and seston to track the delivery of riverine-derived materials from the lower Muskegon River Watershed (MRW) into the near shore area of southeast Lake Michigan. Nutrient flux data indicated that seasonal loads of 1800 metric tons (MT) of particulate organic carbon, 3400 MT of dissolved organic carbon, and 24 MT of total phosphorus were discharged from the lower Muskegon River, with approximately 33% of TP load and 53% of the POC load intercepted within the drowned river mouth terminus, Muskegon Lake. Carbon: phosphorus molar ratios of seston in Muskegon River (C:P = 187) and Muskegon Lake (C:P = 176) were lower than in Lake Michigan (C:P = 334), indicating phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton in near shore Lake Michigan. Isotopic signatures of seston collected in Muskegon Lake were depleted in delta C-13 (-30.8 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand) relative to the isotope signatures of seston from Lake Michigan (-26.2 +/- 13 parts per thousand) or the mouth of the Muskegon River (-28.1 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand), likely due to the presence of biogenic methane in Muskegon Lake. Seston delta N-15 increased on a strong east-to-west gradient within Muskegon Lake, indicating significant microbial processing of nutrients. The extent of nutrient uptake in Muskegon Lake altered the chemical and isotopic characterization of seston flowing into Lake Michigan from Muskegon River.

J	Mitchell, JL				Mitchell, Jonathan L.			The drying of Titan's dunes: Titan's methane hydrology and its impact on atmospheric circulation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												We explore the effect of a finite reservoir of methane on Titan's atmospheric circulation, precipitation patterns, and surface methane content. We develop a soil model that accounts for the methane cycle in the surface-atmosphere system, and we implement this surface model in a two-dimensional model of the Titan's atmosphere. Seasonal oscillations in latitude of the large-scale circulation accomplish net drying of the low-latitude surface by diverging methane vapor from low latitudes to higher latitudes. Simulations with an initially deep methane reservoir indicate this mechanism is able to dry similar to 1.75 meters of liquid methane per Titan year from the low-latitude surface. The existence of low-latitude desert morphologies suggests that the system has had sufficient time to completely remove the surface methane by this mechanism. We then varied the reservoir size, focusing on initial depths of 30 meters of liquid methane or less and compared the results to available observations. The climate system has an abrupt transition to a warmer state with less precipitation and nearly global surface drying near the level at which the atmosphere can store the majority of the methane reservoir as vapor or around 6.5 meters of equivalent liquid methane for our particular choice of parameters. A comparison of our model results with Huygens' observations suggests Titan's climate mimics a state in which most of the methane inventory with direct access to the atmosphere (i.e., excluding underground sources) is stored in the atmosphere.																			2169-9097	2169-9100				AUG 22	2008	113	E8							E08015	10.1029/2007JE003017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JE003017													WOS:000258648200001

However, the local environment and climatic conditions promoting hominin activity in the area during the MIS12 glacial remain largely unknown. In order to reconstruct the paleo-environment including paleo-lake levels and governing paleo-climatic factors on a high temporal resolution, we analyzed a 6-meter-long sediment sequence from the archeological site MAR-1 and a Bayesian age model was computed for a better age constrain of the different sedimentary units. A multiproxy approach was applied using ostracods, sponge spicules, diatoms, grain sizes, total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon and conventional X-ray fluorescence analysis. The results from the site represent a protected region surrounded by high mountains under the constant influence of water, either as a shallow partly anoxic water body surrounded by reed belts (>463-457 ka, <434-427 ka), a riverine-lake deltaic system (similar to 457-448 ka), a floodplain (similar to 448-444 ka) or a seasonal freshwater pond (similar to 444-436 ka). The local changes of water levels resemble large trends and rhythms of regional records from the Mediterranean and appear to directly respond to sea surface temperature (SST) changes of the North Atlantic. In particular, when the SSTs are high, more moisture reaches the study area and vice versa. Additional water reaches MAR-1 through melting of the surrounding glaciers after brief warm phases during MIS12 in the Mediterranean realm, which leads to the formation of smaller fresh water ponds, where also the horizon of the excavated remains is placed. Such ponds, rich in ostracods and other microorganisms, provided mammals and humans valuable resources, such as potable water, a wide range of plant species and hunting opportunities. These deposits therefore bear a high archeological potential. The results from our study suggest that the Megalopolis Basin could have served as a refugium for hominins and other organisms due to its capacity to retain freshwater bodies during glacial and interglacial periods.					; Junginger, Annett/A-1909-2017; Schnabel, Ellen/NOF-3850-2025; Konidaris, George/F-3537-2017; Harvati, Katerina/A-5197-2008; Iliopoulos, George/H-4679-2011; Karkanas, Panagiotis/F-7762-2011	Zachow, Charlotte/0009-0006-4735-4131; Iliopoulos, George/0000-0002-4875-128X; 														2296-6463				JUL 1	2021	9								668445	10.3389/feart.2021.668445	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.668445													WOS:000673710900001
J	Canning, A; Wehrli, B; Körtzinger, A				Canning, Anna; Wehrli, Bernhard; Koertzinger, Arne			Methane in the Danube Delta: the importance of spatial patterns and diel cycles for atmospheric emission estimates	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Methane (CH4) is one of the substantial greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, and its concentration has increased by similar to 4 % over the last decade. Although sources driving these increases are not well constrained, one potential contribution comes from wetlands, which are usually intertwined with rivers, channels and lakes, creating a considerable need to acquire higher-resolution data to facilitate modelling and predictions. Here we took a fully contained sensor set-up to obtain measurements of CH4, O-2 and auxiliary parameters, installed on a houseboat for accessibility, to assess and analyse surface water concentrations within the Danube Delta, Romania. During three expeditions in different seasons, we transected a similar to 400 km route with concentration mapping and two additional stations for monitoring diel cycles. Overall, the delta was a source for CH4 throughout all seasons, with concentrations ranging between 0.113-15.6 mu mol L-1. Calculated diffusive CH4 fluxes for the overall delta yielded an average of 49 +/- 61 mu mol m(-2) L-1, corresponding to an extrapolated annual flux of 0.43 +/- 0.53 mol m(-2) yr(-1). The dataset was split into three different subsystems - lakes, rivers and channels - with channels showing the highest variability. We found overlapping CH4 concentrations throughout each subsystem, with large inflows coming from reed beds and channels into the lakes. Seasonal variability and water flow direction also influenced the overall dynamics in each region. We found large to extreme diel cycles in both the lakes and channels, with concentrations varying by an order of magnitude between these two systems. The lake diel cycle showed a clear linear trend with an O-2 : CH4 molar ratio of -50 : 1 during the phase of nocturnal convection, with the two water stratified bodies mixing during the night, suggesting daily vertical stratification allowing for macrophytes to create a temporal oxycline due to a lack of light and movement between the stems as previously suggested, and potentially incurring an uncertainty range of a factor of 4.5. Our data illustrate the importance of high-resolution spatio-temporal data collection throughout the entire delta and the increased need for diel cycles in different habitats to improve the concentration and emission estimates from wetland systems.

While very high resolution satellite images enable detailed mapping of these water bodies, the increasing availability and abundance of this imagery calls for fast, reliable and automatized monitoring. This technical work presents a largely automated and scalable workflow that removes image noise, detects water bodies, removes potential misclassifications from infrastructural features, derives lake shoreline geometries and retrieves their movement rate and direction on the basis of ortho-ready very high resolution satellite imagery from Arctic permafrost lowlands. We applied this workflow to typical Arctic lake areas on the Alaska North Slope and achieved a successful and fast detection of water bodies. We derived representative values for shoreline movement rates ranging from 0.40-0.56 m yr(-1) for lake sizes of 0.10 ha-23.04 ha. The approach also gives an insight into seasonal water level changes. Based on an extensive quantification of error sources, we discuss how the results of the automated workflow can be further enhanced by incorporating additional information on weather conditions and image metadata and by improving the input database. The workflow is suitable for the seasonal to annual monitoring of lake changes on a sub-meter scale in the study areas in northern Alaska and can readily be scaled for application across larger regions within certain accuracy limitations.

Here we present the long-term (2011-2020) air mercury monitoring data obtained at the Listvyanka station located at a shore of Lake Baikal, Siberia. The long-term monitoring shows obvious seasonal variation of the background mercury concentration in air, which increases in the cold and decreases in the warm season. The short-term anomalies are associated with the wind carrying the air from the industrial areas where several big coal-fired power plants are located. A positive correlation between the mercury, SO2 and NO2 concentrations is observed both in the short-term variations and in the monthly average concentrations. The analysis of forward and backward trajectories obtained with the HYSPLIT model demonstrates revealing of the mercury emissions sources. During the cruise of 2018, the continuous air mercury survey over Lake Baikal covered 1800 km. The average mercury concentration over Baikal is notably less in comparison with the average value obtained at the onshore Listvyanka station during the same days of the cruise. That can lead to the conclusion that Baikal is a significant sink of the atmospheric mercury.					; Potemkin, Vladimir/GQH-5906-2022; Mashyanov, Nikolay/CAG-1241-2022; Molozhnikova, Yelena/AAD-4552-2022; Molozhnikova, Yelena/K-6707-2018	Sholupov, Sergey/0009-0002-8491-1460; Mashyanov, Nikolay/0000-0003-0108-064X; Molozhnikova, Yelena/0000-0002-3761-9187														2073-4433				JUL	2021	12	7							807	10.3390/atmos12070807	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12070807													WOS:000675903600001

Metabarcoding under Brine: Microbial Ecology of Five Hypersaline Lakes at Rottnest Island (WA, Australia)	WATER												Hypersaline ecosystems-aquatic environments where concentration of salt exceeds 35 g L-1-host microbial communities that are highly specialised to cope with these extreme conditions. However, our knowledge on the taxonomic diversity and functional metabolisms characterising microbial communities in the water columns of hypersaline ecosystems is still limited, and this may compromise the future preservation of these unique environments. DNA metabarcoding provides a reliable and affordable tool to investigate environmental dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, and its use in brine can be highly informative. Here, we make use of bacterial 16S metabarcoding techniques combined with hydrochemical analyses to investigate the microbial patterns (diversity and functions) from five hypersaline lakes located at Rottnest Island (WA). Our results indicate lake-driven microbial aquatic assemblages that are characterised by taxonomically and functionally moderately to extremely halophilic groups, with TDS (total dissolved solids) and alkalinity amongst the most influential parameters driving the community patterns. Overall, our findings suggest that DNA metabarcoding allows rapid but reliable ecological assessment of the hypersaline aquatic microbial communities at Rottnest Island. Further studies involving different hypersaline lakes across multiple seasons will help elucidate the full extent of the potential of this tool in brine.

J	Richardson, RB; Suvedi, M				Richardson, Robert B.; Suvedi, Murari			Assessing the Potential for Small-Scale Aquaculture in Cambodia	ENVIRONMENTS												Fisheries in Cambodia play an important role in supporting household food security and livelihoods throughout the country. Inland fisheries production is largely dependent on numerous ecosystem services, particularly the floodwaters of the Tonle Sap Lake basin, which has been degraded from increased fishing pressure because of population growth and a rising demand for fish. To address the dual problem of food insecurity and overfishing, an integrated food security and climate change program involved the promotion of small-scale aquaculture through semi-intensive pond management. The objective of this study is to examine perceptions of small-scale aquaculture by participants in this program in order to assess the potential for aquaculture to contribute to household food security and conservation of the Tonle Sap Lake ecosystem. Focus group discussions and a household survey were conducted among current and previous fish farmers. Results demonstrate that most farmers continue to practice small-scale aquaculture as a means to supplement household food availability and income. Numerous barriers to adoption of small-scale aquaculture were identified, including access to water, prices of commercial fish feed, selling price of fish in markets and concerns about profitability. Seasonal water scarcity is the most prominent challenge in promoting aquaculture technologies, so aquaculture development should be expanded in areas where there are abundant supplies of water, or where use of water storage techniques is feasible. Aquaculture technology appears to have the potential to contribute to food security, nutrition and household income and to the conservation of the wild fisheries of the Tonle Sap Lake.

Content of highly unsaturated fatty acids in fish from rivers of contrasting temperature	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Contents of highly unsaturated long-chain fatty acids of omega-3 family (HUFA); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3); and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) are the principal indicators of the nutritive quality of fish for humans. Effects of environmental factors, first of all water temperature, on EPA and DHA contents in fish tissue are not currently completely understood. To reveal the putative effect of water temperature, fatty acid composition and contents were studied for 6 fish species, inhabiting the cold waters of the Yenisei River (Siberia, Russia) downstream of a dam (hypolimnetic release from reservoir) and its adjacent warm water tributaries (the Mana River and the Kacha River). It was hypothesized that (a) fish species from the cold river would have higher HUFA contents than fish from the warm rivers and (b) temperature would be negatively correlated with HUFA content in fish species. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, distinct species-specific fatty acid profiles were observed, whereas contents of the essential fatty acids, EPA and DHA, in fish species from the cold Yenisei River were in general similar to that from warm tributaries. Thus, in contrast to the first hypothesis, phylogenetic factors overweighed the effect of water temperature and food (benthic invertebrate) composition, on fatty acid composition and HUFA content in fish. For the second hypothesis, for the 2 species inhabiting both cold and warm rivers, only one had higher EPA and DHA content at lower temperatures. Consequently, the response of EPA and DHA content in fish tissue to temperature variations may be species-specific.

Response of a floodplain fish community to river-floodplain connectivity: natural versus managed reconnection	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To restore lateral connectivity in highly regulated river-floodplain systems, it has become necessary to implement localized, "managed" connection flows, made possible using floodplain irrigation infrastructure. These managed flows contrast with "natural", large-scale, overbank flood pulses. We compared the effects of a managed and a natural connection event on (i) the composition of the large-bodied fish community and (ii) the structure of an endangered catfish population of a large floodplain lake. The change in community composition following the managed connection was not greater than that exhibited between seasons or years during disconnection. By contrast, the change in fish community structure following the natural connection was much larger than that attributed to background, within-and between-year variability during disconnection. Catfish population structure only changed significantly following the natural flood. While the natural flood increased various population rates of native fishes, it also increased those of non-native carp, a pest species. To have a positive influence on native biodiversity, environmental flows may need to be delivered to floodplains in a way that simulates the properties of natural flood pulses. A challenge, however, will be managing river-floodplain connectivity to benefit native more than non-native species.

The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanism of declines in sperm quality as a result of exposure to MC-LR by using spermatogenic cells as a model system. MC-LR was intraperitoneally administered to male rats daily at 0, 50 and 100 mu g/kg body weight for one week. Results showed that changes occurred in the structural of testis, the tubular diameter and the relative weight of the testes was significantly decreased following treatment with 100 mu g/kg. Major differences in apoptosis and proliferation of testicular cells were observed at the 100 mu g/kg MC-LR. The gene expression levels of testis-specific histone 2B (TH2B) and transition protein 2 (TP2) were both significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the stem cell factor receptor (c-kit) was increased after exposure to 50 or 100 mu g/kg MC-LR. This study demonstrated that MC-LR can alter the apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation of spermatogenic cells in vivo.					; Chen, Yu/HTR-0937-2023	Xiang, Zou/0000-0003-3925-0296; 													0388-1350	1880-3989				OCT	2013	38	5					661	670											24025782					WOS:000325598000002
J	Zhao, JJ; Tsai, VC; Huang, YS				Zhao, Jiaju; Tsai, Victor C.; Huang, Yongsong			A nonlinear model for resolving the temperature bias of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) temperature proxies	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are a class of ubiquitous, bacteria-derived lipid biomarkers in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Many studies have demonstrated the potential for brGDGTs as paelotemperature proxies, but the observed seasonal bias in brGDGT-inferred temperatures still remains poorly understood, particularly for Arctic or seasonally dry climates. Here we introduce a new physical framework for understanding variations in the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT) by explicitly modeling the production and preservation of brGDGTs for a bacterial population with an exponential rate dependence on temperature. The dependence of MBT ratios on temperature is predicted to be nonlinear, and thus has a different form from other empirically defined MBT models. We apply the model to understanding how the methylation index depends on not only the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) but also how it depends on the amplitude of the seasonal temperature cycle and the phase and amplitude of the soil moisture content. We performed mesocosm growth experiments using natural lake waters that confirm that the model correctly accounts for lower brGDGT production rates during cold seasonal temperatures. Comparing the new model predictions with global compilations of MBT'5Me and MBT' data, we determine a new calibration of best fitting set of model coefficients that more accurately account for the expected physical constraints on MBT-type data. Our new results account naturally for the expected saturation of MBT'(5Me) and MBT' at low and high temperatures, a bias of up to 5-7 degrees C in MAAT for high seasonal temperature fluctuations, and an additional bias of up to 1-3 degrees C in MAAT for strongly seasonal soil moisture fluctuations. Taken together, the 3 effects explain differences of up to 15 degrees C in inferred MAAT compared with traditional empirical models for MBT'(5Me) and MBT' and results in improved mean squared errors for both. At MAAT above 18 degrees C, MBT' temperature errors are lower than those of MBT'(5Me), suggesting MBT' may still be a useful proxy in some situations despite its added complexity. While we apply the framework only to global MBT'(5Me) and MBT' proxy data, the physical framework can be adapted to other types of paleoproxies and may therefore be more widely applicable. Preliminary application of our model to the Pliocene North Sea Hank Core yields similar to 1 degrees C cooler temperatures than a previous calibration and application to 130 kyr-long Chinese Loess Plateau records yields similar to 4 degrees C warmer glacial and glacial stadial temperatures compared to previous calibration.

J	Qi, LY; Huang, JC; Gao, JF; Cui, Z				Qi, Lingyan; Huang, Jiacong; Gao, Junfeng; Cui, Zhen			Modelling the Impacts of Bathymetric Changes on Water Level in China's Largest Freshwater Lake	WATER												A recent dramatic decline in water level during the dry season in China's largest freshwater lake (Lake Poyang) significantly influenced water availability and biogeochemical processes. To learn the potential causes of water level decline, this study investigated the hydrodynamic response to bathymetric changes during three typical hydrological years by scenario simulation using Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The simulation results indicated that bathymetric changes resulted in a water level decrease during a low water level period. Inter-annual variation in the decrease rate implied that water level in typical dry and wet years were influenced more significantly than that in moderate hydrological years. A spatial gradient in the distribution of water level changes was also observed, which was mainly concentrated in the main channel. Water velocities also slowed down, weakly corresponding to the decrease in water level during the low water level period. Overall, bathymetric changes caused by sand mining contributed to water level and velocity variations, influencing the stability and sustainability of the lake ecosystem. This study can potentially enhance our understanding of the hydrodynamic processes in Lake Poyang and support water resource management.

An exchange of the reservoir water can cause spatiotemporal fluctuations in the salinity and trophic state, which are major drivers determining variation in the composition of biological communities in estuarine systems. Here, we investigated the seasonal and spatial variability in the copepod community and environmental conditions (water temperature, salinity, transparency, chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and Carlson's trophic state index) based on seasonally conducted field monitoring in the Saemangeum Reservoir from July 2013 to January 2018. In addition to the role of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration in structuring the copepod community and diversity, the biological indices of copepods with respect to salinity range and trophic state, were evaluated. The spatiotemporal variability in the salinity and trophic state variables showed contrasting patterns, and chlorophyll a concentration was negatively affected by salinity, indicating that the reservoir water was being highly exchanged with opening of the sluice gates. The mean trophic state index values, however, were constant in the eutrophic state (50-70). Dominant copepods were Acartia (A. hudsonica, A. sinjiensis, Acartia spp.) and Oithona (O. devisee and Oithona spp.), which are common species in eutrophic neritic water. Variation in the copepod community was mainly associated with the seasonal succession of the dominant species rather than a spatial gradient (from around the estuary to the sluice gates); however, site-specific differences in frequencies of several non-dominant species could be detected around the estuary (Sinocalanus tenellus) and the sluice gates (Centropages spp., Tigriopus spp. and Labidocera rotunda). The copepod diversity increased with species-richness from around the estuary to the sluice gates, which could result from variation in the site-specific location of non-dominant species. The frequency of particular species was also able to discriminate in terms of the salinity range (oligohaline: A. pacifica, S. tenellus and A. sinjiensis; mesohaline: Pseudo-diaptomus inopinus; and polyhaline: C. abdominalis and Centropages spp.) and the trophic state (mesotrophic: C. abdominalis, Calanus sinicus and Centropagesspp.; and hypereutrophic: S. tenellus, P. inopinus and Sinocalanus spp.). The findings from this study not only identify the factors determining spatiotemporal variation in the copepod community in the Saemangeum Reservoir, but also expand the applicability of copepods as biological indicators of conditions associated with salinity range and trophic state in other enclosed estuarine systems.					; Jiménez, Alberto/A-6234-2009	chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047; SUH, JONGMO/0000-0003-3161-6345; Oda, Yusuke/0000-0002-6555-1335; Sakamoto, Masaki/0000-0003-4493-5863													1932-6203					DEC 20	2018	13	12							e0209403	10.1371/journal.pone.0209403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209403								30571703					WOS:000453841700068
J	Hangsleben, MA; Allen, MS; Gwinn, DC				Hangsleben, Matt A.; Allen, Micheal S.; Gwinn, Daniel C.			Evaluation of Electrofishing Catch per Unit Effort for Indexing Fish Abundance in Florida Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Electrofishing CPUE data are commonly used to index temporal trends in abundance in fish monitoring programs, but the reliability of this index requires the assumption that the fraction of fish stock caught per unit effort (catchability, q) is relatively precise and constant through time. We evaluated how fish species, season, and lake affected electrofishing catchability in Florida lakes using a field study. We used the field study results to simulate how variable electrofishing q affects statistical power and type I error rate (i.e., the probability of detecting a difference when in fact no difference occurred). Model selection showed that electrofishing catchability varied by species, season, and lake, and submodels showed that catchability varied by lake for Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and by season for Lake Chubsucker Erimyzon sucetta, and was constant across season and lake for Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. Our results revealed that statistical power decreased and the type I error rate increased substantially if q varied through time as we observed for Largemouth Bass and Lake Chubsucker. Type I error rates were well above the expected value of 0.05, reaching as high as 0.7 for Largemouth Bass and 0.55 for Lake Chubsucker at high sample sizes. This resulted because increasing sample size improves the ability to detect real changes, but also increases the probability of detecting spurious changes due to variable q (i.e., type I error). Thus, variable catchability hinders our ability to use CPUE data to index trends in fish abundance, and monitoring programs should consider how q varies before relying on CPUE data to index fish abundance.

J	Yamamoto, Y; Nakahara, H				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Nakahara, Hiroyuki			Seasonal variations in the morphology of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in a eutrophic pond	LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal variations in the cell volume, number of cells in a colony and trichome length of nine bloom-forming cyanobacteria species were investigated in a small eutrophic pond from May to November 2005. The main genera of cyanobacteria were Microcystis and Anabaena, which formed a dense bloom from July to August. M. aeruginosa, M. viridis and M. wesenbergii were present throughout the study period. M. viridis dominated the Microcystis population (39.2-67.1% of total biovolume) during the pre-blooming period, but M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii dominated after July. M. aeruginosa was the dominant species from July to November, constituting 49.0-93.2% of the Microcystis population. Each Microcystis species could always be identified from the cell volume and the number of cells in a colony. The numbers of cells in colonies of M. aeruginosa, M. viridis and M. wesenbergii were in the ranges 37-444, 28-143 and 50-264, respectively. The Anabaena population consisted of three species-A. crassa, A. flos-aquae and A. reniformis. A. crassa and A. flos-aquae were typically present at higher densities than A. reniformis. These species also showed distinctive cell volumes. The number of cells in colonies of A. crassa, A. flos- aquae and A. reniformis were in the ranges 19-178, 18-113 and 29-143, respectively. Planktothrix raciborskii and Raphidiopsis mediterranea appeared in August and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae increased from late October, although these species were less abundant. Cell volumes of Microcystis and Anabaena and trichome length of P. raciborskii were positively correlated with water temperature. Small colonies of Microcystis and Anabaena remained small during the bloom period. In contrast, the trichome length of P. raciborskii seemed to depend more strongly on growth conditions.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2009	10	3					185	193		10.1007/s10201-009-0270-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0270-z													WOS:000271203800004

Alternaria alternata is one of the most abundant fungal spores in the air. The purpose of this study was to examine whether Alternaria spp. spore concentrations can be used to predict the abundance and spatio-temporal pattern of A. alternata spores in the air. This was investigated by testing the hypothesis that A. alternata dominates airborne Alternaria spp. spores and varies spatio-temporally. Secondarily, we aimed at investigating the relationship between airborne Alternaria spp. spores and the DNA profile of A. alternata spores between two proximate (similar to 7 km apart) sites. These were examined by sampling Alternaria spp. spores using Burkard 7-day and cyclone samplers for the period 2016-2018 at Worcester and Lakeside campuses of the University of Worcester, UK. Daily Alternaria spp. spores from the Burkard traps were identified using optical microscopy whilst A. alternata from the cyclone samples was detected and quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results showed that either A. alternata or other Alternaria species spores dominate the airborne Alternaria spore concentrations, generally depending on weather conditions. Furthermore, although Alternaria spp. spore concentrations were similar for the two proximate sites, A. alternata spore concentrations significantly varied for those sites and it is highly likely that the airborne samples contained large amounts of small fragments of A. alternata. Overall, the study shows that there is a higher abundance of airborne Alternaria allergen than reported by aerobiological networks and the majority is likely to be from spore and hyphal fragments.

Also, it is a crucial contributing region to the primary productivity of the water column. Currently, there is a lack of concern about the occurrence of SCM phenomena in studies targeting inland water bodies such as natural lakes and artificial reservoirs. This led to a significant underestimation of the level of primary productivity in these water bodies and their trophic state. In this study, a subtropical reservoir (the Xinanjiang Reservoir, XAJR) was investigated, to understand the characteristics of SCM layer in deep-large reservoir and its contribution to the primary productivity of the water column. Water sampling were conducted from September 2020 to August 2021, and in September 2022. Buoy station data for this reservoir between 2019 and 2021 were also collected. Based on the detailed observations of the water column profile in riverine area (X1), transitional area (X2), and central area (X3 and X4) of this reservoir, it was found that there was an obvious SCM phenomenon, which was closely related to the characteristics of seasonal thermal stratification. The SCM layer of XAJR appeared at depth around 3-5 m underwater from May to August, and as the thermal stratification strength increased, so did the depth and thickness of the SCM layer. It was estimated that gross primary productivity of euphotic layer of XAJR ranged from 347.9 to 4508.6 mgC center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1). The average primary productivity level of the SCM layer reached 1411.7mgC center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), accounting for about 40-90% of the gross primary productivity of euphotic layer. This study contributes to a better understanding of the factors influencing changes in the development of the SCM layer in large reservoirs, as well as its critical role in the inland water carbon cycle.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				AUG 15	2023	231		1						116118	10.1016/j.envres.2023.116118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.116118		MAY 2023						37182826					WOS:001006407200001

Postglacial Reconstruction of Fire History Using Sedimentary Charcoal and Pollen From a Small Lake in Southwest Yukon Territory, Canada	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Previous research suggests climate warming during the current century is likely to lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfire. Recent wildfire seasons in northern Canada generally support these studies, with some of the worst fire seasons on record occurring during the past decade. While we can readily track the spatial and temporal distribution of these events during recent decades using satellite-derived data, these records of past fire activity are relatively short. Proxy records of past fire activity are needed to fully understand how fire regimes may be shifting in response to changing climatic conditions. A high-resolution fire record for the full Holocene was developed using a 539.5-cm sediment core collected from a small lake in southwest Yukon Territory, Canada. Macroscopic charcoal was counted throughout the core at contiguous 0.5-cm intervals. The core was also analyzed for loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility. Fossil pollen preserved in the lake sediment was analyzed to determine vegetation change throughout the Holocene. Macroscopic charcoal analysis indicates an active fire history throughout the record, with 91 fires recorded during the Holocene. Results suggest the fire regime in this region responds to both top-down (climate) and bottom-up (vegetation) factors. Fire return intervals changed in response to shifts in precipitation and temperature as well as the expansion of lodgepole pine into the region. The shifts in precipitation and temperature were attributed to the oscillation of the Aleutian Low pressure system and fluctuations in climate associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age.

J	Li, Y; Fu, X; Chu, XF; Liu, SJ				Li, Yu; Fu, Xiang; Chu, Xuefeng; Liu, Shuangjun			A conflict resolution model for reservoir operation in dry seasons under channel alteration	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The increases in extreme drought events and channel alteration challenge the existing reservoir operation rules. Therefore, reservoir operation should be reconsidered to accommodate these challenges. A conflict resolution model for reservoir operation considering the decision-makers' preference is developed for the conflict between hydropower generation and navigation in dry seasons under channel alteration, to achieve the goal of meeting minimum environmental flow, landslide stability, and river-lake connection constraints. This model with a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the Yangtze River. The results show that minimum navigation discharge for the post-dam period is greater than that for the pre-dam period, indicating channel alteration. Both average hydropower generation benefit and navigation reliability decrease with modification of the post-dam minimum navigation discharge, signifying the adverse effect of damming. The total benefits of navigation and hydropower generation decrease with the exceedance probability.

The quality of remote-sensing images and derived products is key to successful extraction of vegetation phenophases. There is a need to develop quality management methods to evaluate the data uncertainty and assist the removal of the noises. This paper developed a shape quality assurance score threshold (SQAT) method which accounts for the trend in satellite-derived vegetation index associated with the process of vegetation growth. The proposed method was tested on six widely used methods for extracting vegetation phenophases. Results showed that the SQAT method can effectively identify noises in the vegetation index time series and improve the accuracies of estimated start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) of the six methods. After removal of identified noises, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) averagely increased by 8% for SOS, and 11% for EOS. Regression analyses of vegetation phenophases between the PhenoCam observations and MCD12Q2 product showed that the proposed method performs better than the QA score of MCD12Q2 for quality management. This paper provides promising method for quality management; it has the potential to reduce the uncertainty of the vegetation index time series that can support studies of vegetation phenology monitoring.

Incorporating spatial variation of nitrification and denitrification rates into whole-lake nitrogen dynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Despite dramatic increases in nitrogen (N) loading to fresh waters and growing scientific attention on the changing N cycle, measurements of nitrification and denitrification rates in lakes are lacking. In particular, we know little about how these processes vary spatially within a lake, and how this potential spatial variation contributes to a lake's N dynamics. We measured sediment nitrification and denitrification rates at 40 sites in Gull Lake, Michigan (USA), and found that the shallow edge sediments (<2 m deep) of the lake were hot spots of N transformation. Nitrification rates were comparable in sediments at all depths, while sediment denitrification rates were highest in the shallow edge habitat, and lowest in the profundal sediments (<2 m and >10 m deep, respectively). We scaled-up our sediment transformation rates across the lake to illustrate spatial variability in nitrification and denitrification. For whole-lake nitrification, the contribution of shallow edge, littoral, and profundal sediments followed in proportion to lake surface area of each habitat. In contrast, the contribution of each of these areas to whole-lake denitrification was not proportional to their respective surface areas, and instead was equal across the 3 habitat types, with each area contributing roughly 30% of the total N loss via denitrification. Spatially representative characterization of nitrification and denitrification in lentic ecosystems requires incorporation of the spatial variation in these transformations with a particular focus on littoral sediments, and this is often overlooked in studies of lentic N cycling. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes to lake shorelines that influence N cycling in littoral sediments may have a disproportionate effect on whole-lake ecosystem function.

Dreissenid phosphorus excretion can sustain C. glomerata growth along a portion of Lake Ontario shoreline	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												One of the effects of the dreissenid invasion into the Laurentian Great Lakes appears to be a resurgence in the abundance of the nuisance alga Cladophora glomerata which experienced a marked decline following phosphorus abatement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A subsidy of bioavailable phosphorus excreted by dreissenid mussels could be an important mechanism facilitating the growth of C. glomerata. To assess the importance of phosphorus released by mussels to C. glomerata growth in the nearshore, we conducted a survey of mussel distribution and abundance followed by in situ experiments designed to measure dreissenid phosphorus excretion rates. Average dreissenid mussel abundance in our study area was 3674 individuals/m(2), with an average biomass of 52.2 g of shelf free dry mass/m(2). The mussels excreted bioavailable soluble reactive phosphorus at an average rate of 7.02 mu g SRP/g shell free dry mass/hour, contributing about 11 t of soluble reactive phosphorus to our study area over the C. glomerata growing season. Dreissenids appear to be an important source of recycled bioavailable phosphorus to the nearshore, supplying more soluble reactive phosphorus to our study area than local watercourses and WWTPs, and more phosphorus than is required to sustain local C. glomerata growth.

Palaeolimnology offers tools to explore archives stored in the sediments of Arctic lakes and ponds. The interpretation of these archives requires a sound knowledge of the ecology and distribution of the sedimentary proxy organisms used. Here we explored the relationship between diatoms, a widely used proxy group of siliceous algae, and the environmental drivers defining their assemblages and diversity in 115 lakes and ponds in Greenland, a markedly understudied arctic region covering extensive climate and environmental gradients. The main environmental drivers of diatom communities were related to climate and lake ontogeny, including both measured and unmeasured (spatially structured) environmental variables. The lakes and ponds in the northern study regions showed a distinctive dominance of small benthic fragilarioid species, while diatom communities in the South(west) of Greenland were more varied, including many epiphytes, owing to the longer growing season and higher habitat diversity of these lakes and ponds. The newly established lakes in the Ilulissat region host markedly different communities compared to all other sites. Species diversity followed an overall clear latitudinal decline towards the North. Despite the large distances between our study regions, diatom dispersal appeared not to be limited. Based on our results, diatoms are an excellent proxy for climate-mediated lake ecosystem change in the Arctic and thus a valuable tool for climate reconstructions in the region. Particular consideration should be given to often unmeasured climate-related drivers, such as in-lake habitat availability, due to their apparent importance in defining Arctic diatom communities.					; Davidson, Thomas/C-6542-2011; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013	Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/0000-0002-3324-1017; Weckstrom, Kaarina/0000-0002-3889-0788; Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X													2296-701X					MAY 10	2023	11								1177638	10.3389/fevo.2023.1177638	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1177638													WOS:000993526900001

Projections of six General Circulation Models (GCMs) in association with high (A2) and low (B1) emission scenarios were adopted in this study from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) for the period 2020 - 2039 to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Gilgel Abbay and Gumara watershed hydrology, the upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. The GCMs selected were screened in accordance with baseline climate statistics of study areas. A weather generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation to drive the General Water Loading Function (GWLF) hydrological model for simulating runoffs. Projected changes in temperature differences and precipitation ratios relative to the baseline were analyzed to explain the variations in evapotranspiration and the influences on runoff. Despite the fact that the projected magnitude varies among GCMs, increasing runoff in both wet and dry seasons was observed for both watersheds, attributable mainly to the increase in precipitation projected by most GCMs. In contrast to the great increases in runoff, variations in evapotranspiration are less significant. The projected runoff in both watersheds implies increased potential for promoting agricultural irrigation in the dry season. Furthermore, it would allow greater inflow to Lake Tana, the largest contributor to the Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile. Therefore, concerned local, state, and federal government organizations shall be prepared to harness opportunities from the projected increase in runoff.

J	Butler-Eldridge, T				Butler-Eldridge, Taylor			Swimming, confusion, and plenty of brews: Negotiating ambivalence within Windermere's fragile waters	HEALTH & PLACE												Windermere is a complex and contested freshwater site which encounters fluctuating social and environmental pressures. Swimmers at Windermere regularly practice across all four seasons while negotiating social concerns such as access, conflicting user groups, public health communications, and swim safety, alongside environmental complications including extreme weather, wastewater, run-off, plastic pollution, algal blooms, biosecurity, and climate change. Simultaneously, these entangled pressures generate ongoing adaptation, ambivalence, and avoidance within the swim communities. Furthermore, they disrupt individualised and inwardly focused understandings of 'healthy' outdoor swimming practices. In contribution to the special issue (on outdoor swimming), this article reflects on how outdoor swimming researchers may methodologically attend to these social and environmental complexities within contested lacustrine environments through an immersive 12-month wet ethnographic approach, combining 'lake-hangouts' and 'swim-along interviews' with different swimmers at Windermere. The article discusses how these relational in-situ approaches can continue to broaden inwardly focused understandings of 'healthy' outdoor swimming practices towards the wider social and environmental relations for both the participants and researcher. The article also highlights senses of ambivalence and ethical tension while negotiating conflicting concerns of ill-health, in and out of Windermere's fragile waters.																			1353-8292	1873-2054				SEP	2024	89								103304	10.1016/j.healthplace.2024.103304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2024.103304		JUL 2024						39084115					WOS:001285515900001
J	Assine, ML; Silva, A				Assine, Mario Luis; Silva, Aguinaldo			Contrasting fluvial styles of the Paraguay River in the northwestern border of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Upper Paraguay drainage basin is situated mainly in west-central Brazil. near the Bolivian border. Flowing from north to south, the Paraguay is the trunk river of an alluvial depositional tract characterized by complex geomorphologic zonation that resulted from an intricate geologic evolution since the Late Pleistocene. This paper focuses on the geomorphology of the Paraguay River at the northwestern border of the Pantanal wetland, where two broad geomorphologic zones were distinguished. North from the Pantanal wetland, the Paraguay River flows in an aggradational fluvial plain, 5 km wide and incised into older alluvial deposits. The river exhibits a meandering style over most of its course, but sinuosity drops from 2.2 to 1.1 near the northwest border of the Pantanal wetland where the river has been forming the Paraguay fluvial megafan since the Late Pleistocene. The river deflects 90 degrees eastward at the entrance into the Pantanal, changing its fluvial style because of a progressive loss of confinement downstream of the point where the river reaches lowland plains. The river becomes more sinuous. adopts a distributary pattern within the wetland and brings about the creation of the modern depositional lobe characterized by higher topographic gradient and active sedimentation likely linked to increased accommodation space allowing progradation. Fluvial discharge diminishes in the Pantanal wetland because of channel overbank flow during the rainy season and frequent levee crevassing. Avulsion belts and channel-levee complex are preserved on the floodplain as relict forms. South of the convergence of the two main channels that define the Taiama Island, a loss of gradient marks the base of the depositional lobe. Further downstream, the Paraguay River returns to a meandering fluvial style, but crossing a large fluvial plain populated by hundreds of small lakes and seasonally flooded that characterizes the Pantanal wetland.

The comprehensive Water Quality Index (WQI), the Eutrophication Integrated Index (TLI(Sigma)), and the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model were employed to evaluate water quality and the contribution of pollution sources for these lakes. The results show that WQI for all lakes indicated generally good water quality, with DT scoring 73.52-86.18, the highest among them. During the wet season, the eutrophication degree of river-connected lake was medium, and that of gate-controlled lakes was high. The surface runoff and agricultural non-point sources are the main pollution sources for both types of lakes, but their impact is more pronounced in gate-controlled lakes during the wet season. The study provides evidence support for scientific understanding of water quality problems and management strategies in these areas.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP	2024	206								116760	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116760		JUL 2024						39079476					WOS:001282616500001

However, many studies continue to arbitrarily select bias correction methods for error reduction. This work evaluated the implications of bias correction methods on the projections of climate change impact on streamflow of the Gidabo sub-basin, Ethiopia. Climate outputs from four global climate model and regional climate model (GCM-RCM) combinations for the representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5) scenario were used. Five bias correction methods were used to reduce the systematic errors of the simulated rainfall data. The future changes in rainfall pattern, evapotranspiration, and streamflow were analyzed by using their relative percentage difference between the projected and the baseline period. The distribution mapping method provided better results in mean and extreme rainfall cases. This is also reflected in streamflow projections, as the daily interquartile range value indicates the lowest variability of the projected streamflow. The wet season streamflow will likely decrease in the future, whereas the short rainy season streamflow will increase. Our findings show that climate models and bias correction methods considerably limit the magnitude of future projections of streamflow. However, similar research should be conducted in other catchments to extend the conclusions of this study.					; Taye, Meron Teferi/HDL-9026-2022	Taye, Meron Teferi/0000-0002-4687-4622; Haile, Alemseged Tamiru/0000-0001-8647-2188; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				MAY	2022	13	5					2070	2088		10.2166/wcc.2022.396	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2022.396		APR 2022											WOS:000788688600001

Such shifts affect the species dynamics and community succession of lake phytoplankton communities, and they may ultimately influence community stability. However, the relative importance of different biotic mechanisms influencing the community stability of phytoplankton along nutrient and associated zooplankton grazing pressure gradients remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the importance of four potential stabilizing biotic metrics-taxon richness, synchrony, community dominance and biomass of phytoplankton to the seasonal stability over two decades of re-oligotrophication in 20 Danish lakes. We found no clear temporal patterns in seasonal stability across lakes but considerable variations in the individual lakes. Total phosphorus (TP) affected the seasonal stability of the phytoplankton communities either directly or indirectly through changes in community dominance. Total nitrogen (TN) influenced the seasonal stability indirectly via changes in phytoplankton taxon richness, synchrony, and community dominance. Grazer richness (that is, zooplankton taxa richness) impacted the seasonal stability indirectly through changes in phytoplankton taxon richness and synchrony. Grazing pressure, using the biomass ratio of zooplankton:phytoplankton as a proxy, had an indirect effect on seasonal stability via changes in synchrony and community dominance. Compensatory dynamics (as indicated by the synchrony of phytoplankton) exerted dominant control of phytoplankton seasonal stability at high TN and high grazer richness and pressure, while the portfolio effect (as indicated by taxon richness) contributed to phytoplankton seasonal stability at low TN and high grazer richness. However, a strongly negative selection effect (as indicated by community dominance of phytoplankton) was observed at high nutrient levels and low grazer richness. Grazer richness and grazing pressure had stronger stabilizing effects on the seasonal succession of the phytoplankton communities than did TP and TN. Our results highlight how various biotic mechanisms (for example, compensatory dynamics and portfolio effect) can change in their importance in maintaining the seasonal stability of phytoplankton communities subjected to nutrient and grazer control.

Benefits of hormone treatment of both sexes in semi-artificial reproduction of pikeperch (Sander lucioperca L.)	CZECH JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Propagation of pikeperch Sander lucioperca by semi-artificial management was investigated using hormonal induction to better understand the effect of hormonal treatment of both sexes. Fourteen pairs of pikeperch brood fish were divided into two groups (seven pairs in each group). Seven females in Group A and both sexes in Group B were hormonally injected with 500 IU of hCG per kg. Each pair of brood fish was held separately in a 300-l circular tank with an added spawning material on the bottom. Brood fish were removed from the tanks on the day after spawning; three-hundred randomly selected eggs were removed from the spawning nests and transferred to 250 ml plastic incubators. Sperm samples were collected from males in individual 1-ml syringes. Significant differences in fertilization rate (Group A 59.5%, Group B 80.4%), hatching rate (Group A 51.2%, Group B 71.6%), and number of larvae produced per female (Group A 49 429, Group B 122 000) were observed. Differences were attributable to sperm quality, primarily volume (Group A 0.16 ml, Group B 0.64 ml), and duration of spermatozoa motility (Group A 59.5 s, Group B 97.7 s). Hormone treatment of both sexes is beneficial for pikeperch semi-artificial reproduction by inducing ovulation and improving milt production and spermatozoa quality, fertilization and hatching rate, all contributing to a higher number of produced larvae.

A comparison between taxonomic and functional groups-based models	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In this paper we address the formulation of two mechanistic water quality models that differ in the way the phytoplankton community is described. We carry out parameter estimation subject to differential-algebraic constraints and validation for each model and comparison between models performance. The first approach aggregates phytoplanlcton species based on their phylogenetic characteristics (Taxonomic group model) and the second one, on their morpho-functional properties following Reynolds' classification (Functional group model). The latter approach takes into account tolerance and sensitivity to environmental conditions. The constrained parameter estimation problems are formulated within an equation oriented framework, with a maximum likelihood objective function. The study site is Paso de las Piedras Reservoir (Argentina), which supplies water for consumption for 450,000 population. Numerical results show that phytoplankton morpho-functional groups more closely represent each species growth requirements within the group. Each model performance is quantitatively assessed by three diagnostic measures. Parameter estimation results for seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community and main biogeochemical variables for a one-year time horizon are presented and compared for both models, showing the functional group model enhanced performance. Finally, we explore increasing nutrient loading scenarios and predict their effect on phytoplankton dynamics throughout a one-year time horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Malekian, A; Kazemzadeh, M				Malekian, Arash; Kazemzadeh, Majid			Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Regional Trends and Shift Changes of Autocorrelated Temperature Series in Urmia Lake Basin	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Recently, the Urmia Lake located in northwestern Iran which is the second largest hyper saline in the world suffers from the significant fluctuations of water level and surface area. The current study tries to investigate the spatiotemporal trends of mean (T-mean), maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperatures of monthly, seasonal and annual time-series. To do so, the data of 15 temperature gauge stations within the Urmia Lake basin, for the period 1972-2011 was employed. The prewhitening approach was applied to remove the effects of serial correlation in the air temperature series based on the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. The results of Ljung-Box test showed positive serial correlation in the T-mean and T-max series for all of the stations at the 0.05 significance level. In the monthly series, the significant warming trends in the T-mean series were more perceptible than the same ones in T-max series; however, T-max trend was found more than T-min series. The Mann-Whitney (MW) test detected a significance upward shift changes in the annual T-mean, T-max and T-min series of about 86, 73 and 80 % of the stations, respectively. The average magnitude of significant warming trends in annual T-mean, T-max and T-min series were (+) 0.58 degrees C, (+) 0.52 degrees C and (+) 0.69 degrees C per decade, respectively. Furthermore, the interpolation maps showed that warming trends in the east and west of Urmia Lake were more than southern area. Therefore, the results showed that the basin has suffered from increasing trends in the T-mean, T-max and T-min ov er the recent decades. Finally, significant changes were found in 1980s and 1990s based on the Mann-Kendall ranks and change point tests. In this study, it is interesting that the period of significant changes in warming trends were close to the beginning of decreasing water level of the Lake.					; Malekian, Arash/AAQ-8861-2020	Malekian, Arash/0000-0001-8174-6784; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2016	30	2					785	803		10.1007/s11269-015-1190-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-015-1190-9													WOS:000369520400020
J	Samsonov, SV; Lantz, TC; Kokelj, SV; Zhang, Y				Samsonov, Sergey V.; Lantz, Trevor C.; Kokelj, Steven V.; Zhang, Yu			Growth of a young pingo in the Canadian Arctic observed by RADARSAT-2 interferometric satellite radar	CRYOSPHERE												Advancements in radar technology are increasing our ability to detect Earth surface deformation in permafrost environments. In this paper we use satellite Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) to describe the growth of a large, relatively young pingo in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands. High-resolution RADARSAT-2 imagery (2011-2014) analyzed with the Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) DInSAR revealed a maximum 2.7aEuro-cmaEuro-yr(-1) of domed uplift located in a drained lake basin. Satellite measurements suggest that this feature is one of the largest diameter pingos in the region that is presently growing. Observed changes in elevation were modeled as a 348aEuro- x aEuro-290aEuro-m uniformly loaded elliptical plate with clamped edge. Analysis of historical aerial photographs suggested that ground uplift at this location initiated sometime between 1935 and 1951 following drainage of the residual pond. Uplift is largely due to the growth of intrusive ice, because the 9aEuro-% expansion of pore water associated with permafrost aggradation into saturated sands is not sufficient to explain the observed short- and long-term deformation rates. The modeled thickness of ice-rich permafrost using the Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature (NEST) was consistent with the maximum height of this feature. Modeled permafrost aggradation from 1972 to 2014 approximated elevation changes estimated from aerial photographs for that time period. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that uplift is at least in part a result of freezing of the sub-pingo water lens. Seasonal variations in the uplift rate seen in the DInSAR data closely match the modeled seasonal pattern in the deepening rate of freezing front. This study demonstrates that interferometric satellite radar can detect and contribute to understanding the dynamics of terrain uplift in response to permafrost aggradation and ground ice development in remote polar environments. The present-day growth rate is smaller than predicted by the modeling and no clear growth is observed at other smaller pingos in contrast with field studies performed mainly before the 1990s. Investigation of this apparent discrepancy provides an opportunity to further develop observation methods and models.

We provide an overview of the species inventory in these lakes, which, amongst other fascinating species, host the well-known cyanoprokaryote Arthrospira fusiformis, commercially sold under the name 'Spirulina', and large flocks of Lesser Flamingos sometimes reaching densities of over one million individuals per lake. We further discuss physiological adaptations of organisms to the harsh environment as well as the variability of population dynamics and the food web structure of soda lakes. An emphasis is put on the description of environmental drivers and autogenic internal biological dynamics triggering shifts in plankton community composition and the consequences for higher trophic levels. We also elaborate on energy budgets and the importance of aquatic-terrestrial coupling in soda lakes. These are some of the key aspects pointing to promising new avenues for future research on these fascinating ecosystems.

J	Rientjes, T; Haile, AT; Fenta, AA				Rientjes, Tom; Haile, Alemseged Tamiru; Fenta, Ayele Almaw			Diurnal rainfall variability over the Upper Blue Nile Basin: A remote sensing based approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In this study we aim to assess the diurnal cycle of rainfall across the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin using satellite observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Seven years (2002-2008) of Precipitation Radar (PR) and TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) data are used and analyses are based on GIS operations and simple statistical techniques. Observations from PR and TMI reveal that over most parts of the basin area, the rainfall occurrence and conditional mean rain rate are highest between mid- and late-afternoon (15:00-18:00 LST). Exceptions to this are the south-west and south-eastern parts of the basin area and the Lake Tana basin where midnight and early morning maxima are observed. Along the Blue Nile River gorge the rainfall occurrence and the conditional mean rain rate are highest during the night (20:00-23:00 LST). Orographic effects by large scale variation of topography, elevation and the presence of the UBN river gorge were assessed taking two transects across the basin. Along transects from north to south and from east to west results indicate increased rainfall with increase of elevation whereas areas on the windward side of the high mountain ranges receive higher amount of rainfall than areas on the leeward side. As such, mountain ranges and elevation affect the rainfall distribution resulting in rain shadow effect in the north-eastern parts of Choke-mountain and the ridges in the north-east of the basin. Moreover, a direct relation between rainfall occurrence and elevation is observed specifically for 17:00-18:00 LST. Further, results indicate that the rainfall distribution in the deeply incised and wide river gorge is affected with relatively low rainfall occurrence and low mean rainfall rates in the gorge areas. Seasonal mean rainfall depth is highest in the south-west area and central highlands of the basin while areas in the north, north-east and along the Blue Nile gorge receive the least amount of rainfall. Statistical results of this work show that the diurnal cycle of rainfall occurrence from TRMM estimates show significant correlation with the ground observations at 95% confidence level. In the UBN basin, the PR conditional mean rain rate estimates are closer to the ground observations than the TMI. Analysis on mean wet season rainfall amount indicates that PR generally underestimates and TMI overestimates the ground observed rainfall. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This land adjacent to Lake Kivu is located at elevations ranging around 900-1900 m asl, experiencing tropical highland climate. A diagnostic survey helped to rapidly obtain in-depth knowledge of constraints and opportunities in this environment. Correspondence analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to investigate the association of production constraints with particular livestock species and to understand the factors that govern the number of livestock that people owned (converted to tropical livestock units [TLU]), respectively. Responses of 112 informants demonstrated that livestock is an integral part of the region's mixed farming systems. Low livestock numbers per household at present reflect the poverty as a consequence of recent violent conflicts. Currently, farmers focus on small livestock, like poultry, swine, cavies (i.e., Guinea pigs) and rabbits. Families keep livestock to accumulate household reserves that are strongly invested in children's education. Major issues of animal husbandry were related to animal diseases and lack of feed resources, particularly in the dry season. Lack of feed or forages were unrelated to a particular livestock species. Livestock holdings depended on animal diversity, location, land size available and respondents' education level. The potential introduction of improved forages is challenged by their dry-season tolerance, compatibility with cropping on small farms; and people's readiness to cultivate forages.

J	Wang, CH				Wang, Changhui			Regulating phytoplankton-available suspended particulate phosphorus (P) to control internal P pollution in lake: Conclusion from a short review	CHEMOSPHERE												The necessity on controlling internal P pollution has been widely reported for lake restoration; thus far, cutting the migrations of soluble P from sediment to overlying water, especially under anoxic condition, is the main target of the internal P pollution control to achieve favorable ecological responses in lake. Here, according to the types of P directly available by phytoplankton, phytoplankton-available suspended particulate P (SPP) pollution, which mainly occurs under aerobic condition and due to sediment resuspension and soluble P adsorption by suspended particle, is found to be the other kind of internal P pollution. The SPP has long been a key index for environmental quality assessment, which could be indirectly reflected by the developed various methods for phytoplankton-available P pool analysis; also, the P has been demonstrated to be a major cause of phytoplankton breeding, typically in shallow lakes. Importantly, compared to the soluble P, SPP pollution clearly has more complicated loading pathways and P activation mechanisms and involves in different fractions of P, even part of which are with relatively high stability in sediment and suspended particle, leading to the potential control measures for the pollution being more complex. Considering the potential differences of internal P pollution among various lakes, this study is therefore calling for more research to focus on regulating phytoplankton-available SPP pollution. Recommendations are also offered to bridge knowledge gap of the regulation to design proper measures for lake restoration.

Patterns of concerted fluctuation in populations-synchrony-can reveal impacts of climatic variability on disease dynamics. We examined whether malaria transmission has been synchronous in an area with a common rainfall regime and sensitive to the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a global climatic phenomenon affecting weather patterns in East Africa. Methods. We studied malaria synchrony in 5 15-year long (1984-1999) monthly time series that encompass an altitudinal gradient, approximately 1000 m to 2000 m, along Lake Victoria basin. We quantified the association patterns between rainfall and malaria time series at different altitudes and across the altitudinal gradient encompassed by the study locations. Results. We found a positive seasonal association of rainfall with malaria, which decreased with altitude. By contrast, IOD and interannual rainfall impacts on interannual disease cycles increased with altitude. Our analysis revealed a nondecaying synchrony of similar magnitude in both malaria and rainfall, as expected under a Moran effect, supporting a role for climatic variability on malaria epidemic frequency, which might reflect rainfall-mediated changes in mosquito abundance. Conclusions. Synchronous malaria epidemics call for the integration of knowledge on the forcing of malaria transmission by environmental variability to develop robust malaria control and elimination programs.					; Chaves, Luis/F-3448-2010; Satake, Akiko/A-5895-2013; Chaves, Luis Fernando/F-3448-2010	, Noboru/0000-0003-3664-9605; Hashizume, Masahiro/0000-0003-4720-1750; Chaves, Luis Fernando/0000-0002-5301-2764													0022-1899	1537-6613				JUN 15	2012	205	12					1885	1891		10.1093/infdis/jis289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis289								22492847					WOS:000304539600017

Especially, the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the Yangtze River further aggravated the drought in lake. To explore the approaches to alleviate drought in Poyang Lake, this study simulated and quantified the influences of increasing water release of the TGR during the dry periods on water regimes of Poyang Lake, including the lake water level, duration of low water, flow velocity, flow field of lake, as well as potential suitable habitat area of migratory birds, based on a hydrodynamic model. Major results showed that the increase of water release of the TGR raised the lake water level, especially in the northern lake area, with the average lake level increase of 0.2-1.08 m and the lowest lake level increase of 0.16-0.68 m. Meanwhile, the duration of low water was significantly shortened, from 127 days to 87-116 days (threshold lake level of 12.0 m) at Xingzi station. In addition, the hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the increasing water release of the TGR reduced the lake flow velocity and discharge of Poyang Lake, which decreased the outflow of lake by 1.66-17.87 x 10(8) m(3), accounting for about 0.47%-5.11% of the total outflow in the dry season. Finally, the potential suitable habitat area with 0.2-0.6 m water depth increased by 1.7-27.9 km(2) in December-February, and showed a significant expansion trend in the central area of Poyang Lake. Outcomes of the study are useful for understanding the influences of water release of the TGR on water regimes of downstream lakes, and can provide valuable references for mitigating lake droughts in complex river-lake system.

Climate-forced changes in available energy and methane bubbling from subarctic lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Strong correlations between seasonal energy input and methane (CH4) bubbling (ebullition) in northern lakes suggest that energy proxies might provide a constraint on the magnitude of future CH4 emissions. Ebullition is a major pathway for transporting anaerobically produced CH4 from lake sediments to the atmosphere and represents a large unquantified CH4 source. In high-latitude, postglacial lakes during the ice-free season, solar shortwave energy input can constrain CH4 productivity via control of sediment temperature. Utilizing long-term climatic predictors, we calculate CH4 ebullition from three subarctic lakes in northern Sweden over the period of 1916-2079. Using observed energy trends, the seasonal average lake CH4 ebullition is predicted to increase by 80% between the 1916-1926 decade and the 2040-2079 period. Present-day seasonal average methane ebullition is estimated to have already increased 24% since the 1916-1926 decade.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021	Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2015	42	6					1936	1942		10.1002/2015GL063189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL063189													WOS:000353170000041

Modern pollen deposition in relation to vegetation and climate of Balpakram valley, Meghalaya, northeast India: Implications for Indo-Burma palaeoecological contexts	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Balpakram valley, the sacred grove of the Garo tribe in Meghalaya, is world famous for its tropical unique biodiversity, physiography, seismically active zone, and proximity to Cherrapunjee. The area was not previously approached for palynological study due to its remoteness, impenetrable forest and wildlife. A modern pollen database of 120 surface samples from Balpakram valley indicates a good correlation of modern pollen, extant vegetation, and climate. Five pollen zones (forest types) have been recorded based on the regional pollen marker taxa corresponding to the ratio of evergreen and deciduous forest elements (> 30% signifies the forest type). The present vegetation is similar to the Indo-Burmese vegetation except for a unique Duabanga-Schima-Nepenthes assemblage due to high monsoonal activity with a strong perennial river and streamlet system. The evergreen woody taxa in abundance along with Dendropthoe, Piperaceae and Impatiens in the assemblage are significant and suggestive of dense forest with high monsoonal activity. The abundance of Poaceae along with an Artemisia Chenopodiaceae assemblage shows a savanna forest type, attributed to seasonal dryness and a poor water system in a restricted region. The absence of Dipterocarpaceae pollen, a characteristic taxon of the Indo-Malayan forest, is indicative of a regional effect. The poor representation of bamboo pollen may be attributed due to low pollen production (one-time flowering) and preservation. Pollen of Nepenthes khasiana in sediment signifies high precipitation, and is also indicative of this high pollen producer with good preservation status. No medicinal plants, specifically Costus speciosus and Swertia chirata, are observed despite their luxuriant growth in the region, which may be due to poor pollen production. Abundance of Cyathea (tree fern) along with Lycopodium and Pyrrosia signifies high rainfall and humid climate. The presence of coprophilous fungi including Sordaria and Cercophora is indicative of wildlife habitation in the area. The unique forest vegetation of Balpakram valley is mainly controlled by annual precipitation with perennial rivers and streamlets, moisture availability, and altitudinal variation in the region. This study will be helpful to generate palaeoecological data for surrounding ecozones including eastern Himalaya and Indo-Malayan regions, to trace migratory routes for flora and fauna in the Indo-Burma ranges.

Phytoplankton time series data from Lake Stechlin, an oligo-mesotrophic lake in the Baltic Lake District (Germany) were used. Of the 254 algal species recorded during the 15-year of studies with roughly biweekly sampling, 212 species were planktonic. In the individual plankton years, the recorded total number of species changed between 97 and 122, of which the number of dominants (> 1% contribution to the annual average of total biomass) was only 10-19. The 15-year cumulative number of species exhibited an almost linear increase after an initial saturation phase. This increase was attributed to two reasons: increase of sample size and immigration of species new to the flora. Based on a probabilistic model developed in this study, we estimated the number of co-existing planktonic species of the lake as some 180, and the rate of floral change as 1-2 species per year. Of these co-existing species, only few maintain the matter-energy processing ecosystem functions in any particular plankton year. Selection of these dominants is probably driven by mesoclimatic cycles, coupled with human-induced forcing, like eutrophication. All others are hiding as an ecological memory, in the sense of the capacity or experiences of past states to influence present or future responses of the community. Data analyses suggest that selection of the 'memory species' that show temporary abundance increases over shorter (several years) periods are largely dependent upon the dominants. These results show that interspecific interactions and the particular autecological features of the dominants, together with their effects on the whole ecosystem, act as a major organizing force. Some phytoplankton species, like Planktothrix rubescens, are efficient ecosystem engineers with cascading effects of both a top-down and bottom-up nature. Historical scientific data on Planktothrix blooms in Lake Stechlin suggest cyclic patterns in long-term development of phytoplankton which, as the legend of the Red Cock suggests, dates back much further than scientific archives.

This new model is known as the community land model (CLM2). In CLM2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. The vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. The relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. The soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. Most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. Major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit treatment of liquid water and ice; a multilayer snowpack; runoff based on the TOPMODEL concept; new formulation of ground and vegetation fluxes; and vertical root profiles from a global synthesis of ecological studies. Simulations with CCM3 show significant improvements in surface air temperature, snow cover, and runoff for CLM2 compared to LSM1. CLM2 generally warms surface air temperature in all seasons compared to LSM1, reducing or eliminating many cold biases. Annual precipitation over land is reduced from 2.35 mm day(-1) in LSM1 to 2.14 mm day(-1) in CLM2. The hydrologic cycle is also different. Transpiration and ground evaporation are reduced. Leaves and stems evaporate more intercepted water annually in CLM2 than LSM1. Global runoff from land increases from 0.75 mm day(-1) in LSM1 to 0.84 mm day(-1) in CLM2. The annual cycle of runoff is greatly improved in CLM2, especially in arctic and boreal regions where the model has low runoff in cold seasons when the soil is frozen and high runoff during the snowmelt season. Most of the differences between CLM2 and LSM1 are attributed to particular parameterizations rather than to different surface datasets. Important processes include: multilayer snow, frozen water, interception, soil water limitation to latent heat, and higher aerodynamic resistances to heat exchange from ground.					; dai, yongjiu/D-6261-2014; Yang, Zong-Liang/B-4916-2011; , Keith/A-9328-2008; Yang, Zong-Liang/IZE-2309-2023; Dai, Yongjiu/D-6261-2014; Oleson, Keith/A-9328-2008	Zeng, Xubin/0000-0001-7352-2764; dai, yongjiu/0000-0002-3588-6644; Yang, Zong-Liang/0000-0003-3030-0330; , Keith/0000-0002-0057-9900; 													0894-8755	1520-0442				NOV	2002	15	22					3123	3149		10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<3123:TLSCOT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<3123:TLSCOT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000178884800002

The probability of nest predation in a colony can vary depending on several factors, such as the nest's location in the colony and the level of aggregation of nests. We studied the nesting success of colonial great crested grebes and monitored the occurrence of the non-native invasive American mink in the colony. From among 92 grebe nests, 54.3% were successful. The daily survival rate (DSR) of grebe nests was positively affected by the increasing distance between the nest and lake shoreline, and negatively affected by the increasing distance between the nest and the five nearest grebe nests. The probability of mink occurrence in the colony increased with consecutive days of the breeding season and decreased with increasing distance from the lake shoreline. The DSR of grebe nests decreased with the increasing probability of mink occurrence along the shoreline distance gradient and the day of the breeding season. The results of the study confirm the impact of the American mink on waterbirds during the breeding season but also indicate that large breeding colonies are partially safe from mink predation, and that nest accessibility and the dilution effect influence the probability of nest survival. Our data suggest that the limited access to safe breeding sites on large lakes that can supply adult grebes and their chicks with food may affect bird productivity and population numbers at the landscape level.

Photodegraded dissolved organic matter from peak freshet river discharge as a substrate for bacterial production in a lake-rich great Arctic delta	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Lake-rich Arctic river deltas are recharged with terrigenous dissolved organic matter (DOM) during the yearly peak water period corresponding with the solstice (24 h day(-1) solar irradiance). Bacteria-free DOM collected during peak Mackenzie River discharge was exposed to sunlight for up to 14 days in June 2010. As solar exposure increased, carbon and lignin concentrations declined (10% and 42%, respectively, after 14 days), as did DOM absorptivity (62% after 14 days), aromaticity, and molecular weight. Photochemical changes were on par with those normally observed in Mackenzie Delta lakes over the entire open-water season. When irradiated freshet DOM was provided as a substrate, no significant differences were observed in community-level metabolism among five bacterial communities from representative delta habitats. However, bacterial abundance was significantly greater when nonirradiated (0 day) rather than irradiated DOM (7 or 14 days) was provided, while cell-specific metabolic measures revealed that per-cell bacterial production and growth efficiency were significantly greater when communities were provided irradiated substrate. This complex response to rapid DOM photodegradation may result from the production of inhibitory reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with shifts in bacterial community composition to species that are better able to tolerate ROS, or metabolize the labile photodegraded DOM.

Mass balance analysis and calculation of wind effects on heat fluxes and water temperature in a large lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Modeling applications often ignore the water mass balance for hydrodynamic simulations in large lakes such as the Great Lakes. However, evaluation of the water budget can be of interest, especially when water surface calculations are important, and also as it relates to the heat budget. In this study Lake Ontario is modeled using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code for the heating seasons in 2008-2013, with calibration focused on 2008, for which more data are available. The model is used to test both water mass and heat budgets, and various interpolation schemes for meteorological data are tested to determine the degree of sensitivity of results to the interpolation method used. The water budget incorporates flow from major tributaries and precipitation/evaporation, and it is shown that these processes alone cannot provide a balance. Missing water quantities include direct runoff and flows from smaller, probably ungauged tributaries. In 2008 the calculated quantity is 1.61 x 10(10) m(3) during April to September, which is equivalent to a change in water surface level of 0.7 m and represents an average flow rate of 1018 m(3)/s, which is larger than the inflow of any tributary to the lake except the Niagara River. Latent and sensible heat flux calculations are highly affected by wind, and interpolation of wind data is found to impact model calculations of those quantities, though different interpolation schemes do not have a strong effect on surface water temperatures. In general, the natural neighbor interpolation method is preferred over inverse distance methods. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that the three systems exhibit unique characteristics on each component. The emergy of rice seeding and the labour input were the most important costs, at 57.18 and 18.20 sej/ha/season, respectively, for the rice mono-cropping system. In the rice-fish and rice-duck systems, the feed input played a more important role, corresponding to values of 63.70 and 79.20 sej/ha/season, respectively. The machinery input was 45.21 sej/ha/season for the rice-fish system due to the construction of fish ponds and ditches. The rice-duck system exhibited lower environmental loading and a higher sustainability index than the rice mono-cropping and rice-fish systems, respectively. The ratios of the economic input to output were 0.41, 0.61 and 0.41 for the rice mono-cropping, rice-fish and rice-duck systems, respectively. The net profit of the rice-duck system was $3264.2 per hectare, which was nearly 40% higher than those of the other systems. Based on the results showing the highest economic efficiency and value on the sustainability index, the rice-duck system may be the optimal rice agriculture system from both ecological and economic perspectives.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2018	38	6					1121	1132		10.1007/s13157-017-0880-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-017-0880-x													WOS:000454171400005
J	Xiao, CL; Lofgren, BM; Wang, J				Xiao, Chuliang; Lofgren, Brent M.; Wang, Jia			WRF-based assessment of the Great Lakes' impact on cold season synoptic cyclones	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Synoptic events in December are studied with regard to the Great Lakes' influence on extratropical cyclones using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Here, four selected events are arranged into two pairs of comparisons: strong events (2006, 2009) versus weak events (2008, 2013); traversing events (2008, 2009) versus bypassing events (2006, 2013). For each case, the land surface model in WRF is initialized with two different configurations: the control run with real land coverage and the no-lake run in which the lakes are replaced by land. The control simulation shows that the WRF model exhibits a good performance in reproducing precipitation, sea-level pressure and air temperature. Comparisons between control and no-lake runs among these cases indicate that the lake-air temperature gradient, inducing vertical heat flux, is most prominent in the weak bypassing event (case 2013), while lake-land roughness contrast contributes to the low-level moisture convergence. The Great Lakes' impact generally strengthens the cyclonic system near the surface but is sensitive to the background flow. This effect becomes much more significant for the development of cyclones with colder atmospheric conditions, suggesting that the meso-to-synoptic scale interaction should be taken into account when considering the Great Lakes' influence.

Association of gastrointestinal illness and recreational water exposure at an inland U.S. beach	WATER RESEARCH												Recent epidemiology studies examining U.S. recreational water exposure and illness relationships have focused primarily on coastal and Great Lakes beaches. Human-made lakes in the U.S. have received little attention in epidemiology studies despite contributing to more waterborne disease epidemics annually than coastal U.S. waters. In a comprehensive beach cohort study, we examined relationships between water quality indicators and reported adverse health outcomes among users of a beach at an inland U.S. lake. Human health data was collected over 26 swimming days during the 2009 swimming season in conjunction with water quality measurements. Adverse health outcomes were reported 8-9 days post-exposure via a phone survey. Wading, playing or swimming in the water was observed to be a significant risk factor for GI illness (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 3.2; CI 1.1, 9.0). Among water users, Escherichia coli density was significantly associated with elevated GI illness risk where the highest E. coli quartile was associated with an AOR of 7.0 (CI 1.5, 32). GI illness associations are consistent with previous freshwater epidemiology studies. Our findings are unique in that our observations of positive associations with Cl illness risk are based upon a single daily E. coli measurement. Lastly, this study focused on an understudied issue, illness risk at inland reservoirs. Our results support the usefulness of E. cob as a health-relevant indicator of water quality for this inland U.S. beach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Smith, A; Delavau, C; Stadnyk, T				Smith, Aaron; Delavau, Carly; Stadnyk, Tricia			Identification of geographical influences and flow regime characteristics using regional water isotope surveys in the lower Nelson River, Canada	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Results are reported from a 3-year monitoring initiative (2010-2013) of stable water isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) at over 50 hydrometric sites in the lower portion of the Nelson River Basin, a key freshwater-marine corridor in Canada with global significance. Data are collected from annual synoptic surveys and a time-series monitoring program. Water isotope signals exhibit significant long-term average (with reported standard deviation) differences between the upper Nelson River (-10.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.18 parts per thousand) and Burntwood River (i.e. Churchill Basin; -12.8 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) regions which are attributed to the geographic extent and origin of the water. Upper Nelson River flow-isotope signals suggest a more temperate climate, and exhibit reverse seasonal cycling (i.e. ice-on isotope enrichment; ice-off isotope depletion) due to the connectivity with and influence of Lake Winnipeg. In contrast, the Burntwood River behaves like a snowmelt-dominated river heavily influenced by wetland storage and enrichment during ice-off periods, exhibiting isotopic signals negatively correlated with headwater river discharge. Flow-weighted delta O-18 and delta H-2 show decreased variability in both regions at extreme low- and high-flow regimes, indicating a tendency towards a single dominant end member: wetland release (low-flow regime) or snowmelt/rainfall (high-flow regime). Mid- to normal-flow regimes exhibit increased isotopic variability, as do small headwater catchments resulting from varied source water contributions, residence times, mixing patterns and the role of landscape-specific features. The Stable Water Isotope Monitoring Network (SWIMN) presented enables the closure of water-isotope mass balance modelling that will facilitate the understanding of changes to freshwater-marine linkages. Les resultats sont bases sur une etude d'echantillonnage de 3 ans (2010-2013) d'isotopes stables de l'eau (delta O-18 et delta H-2) a plus de 50 stations hydrometriques dans la partie inferieure du bassin de la riviere Nelson, un corridor marin d'eau fraiche du Canada d'importance mondiale. Les donnees sont tirees d'etudes synoptiques annuelles et d'un programme de mesure de series chronologiques. Les signaux releves dans les isotopes de l'eau montrent des differences significatives dans les moyennes a long terme (avec ecart-type) entre les regions du haut de la riviere Nelson (-10.5 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.18 parts per thousand) et de la riviere Burntwood (c.-a-d. le bassin de Churchill; -12.8 parts per thousand delta O-18 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand) et sont attribuees a l'etendue geographique et a l'origine de l'eau. Les signaux d'isotopes instables du haut de la riviere Nelson suggerent un climat plus tempere et demontrent un cycle saisonnier inverse (c.-a-d. que lorsque les eaux sont recouvertes de gel, il y a enrichissement et qu'autrement, il y tarissement) resultant de la connexite avec le lac Winnipeg et de l'influence de ce dernier. A l'oppose, la riviere Burntwood reagit comme une riviere dominee par la fonte des neiges et fortement influencee par le stockage des terres humides et l'enrichissement au cours des periodes ou les eaux ne sont pas recouvertes de glace, presentant des signaux isotopiques negativement correles avec les eaux d'amont. Les niveaux de delta O-18 et delta H-2 ponderes par le debit de l'eau presentent une diminution de la variabilite dans les deux regions lorsque les debits sont extremement bas ou eleves, indiquant une tendance vers une source unique : provenant des terres humides (faible debit) ou de la fonte des neiges ou d'averses de pluie (debit eleve). Les debits moyen a normal presentent une augmentation de la variabilite isotopique - comme c'est le cas pour les petits bassins recepteurs d'eau d'amont formes de sources d'eau variees - du temps de retention, de la composition des sources et du role des caracteristiques specifiques au paysage terrestre. Le Reseau de controle des isotopes d'eau stable (SWIMN) presente ici permet de preserver l'equilibre du bilan massique des isotopes d'eau, ce qui permettra de mieux comprendre les changements dans les liens entre les eaux douces et marines.

The role of microbial communities in biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gas emissions within tropical soda lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although anthropogenic activities are the primary drivers of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is crucial to acknowledge that wetlands are a significant source of these gases. Brazil 's Pantanal, the largest tropical inland wetland, includes numerous lacustrine systems with freshwater and soda lakes. This study focuses on soda lakes to explore potential biogeochemical cycling and the contribution of biogenic GHG emissions from the water column, particularly methane. Both seasonal variations and the eutrophic status of each examined lake significantly influenced GHG emissions. Eutrophic turbid lakes (ET) showed remarkable methane emissions, likely due to cyanobacterial blooms. The decomposition of cyanobacterial cells, along with the influx of organic carbon through photosynthesis, accelerated the degradation of high organic matter content in the water column by the heterotrophic community. This process released byproducts that were subsequently metabolized in the sediment leading to methane production, more pronounced during periods of increased drought. In contrast, oligotrophic turbid lakes (OT) avoided methane emissions due to high sulfate levels in the water, though they did emit CO 2 and N 2 O. Clear vegetated oligotrophic turbid lakes (CVO) also emitted methane, possibly from organic matter input during plant detritus decomposition, albeit at lower levels than ET. Over the years, a concerning trend has emerged in the Nhecola ndia subregion of Brazil 's Pantanal, where the prevalence of lakes with cyanobacterial blooms is increasing. This indicates the potential for these areas to become significant GHG emitters in the future. The study highlights the critical role of microbial communities in regulating GHG emissions in soda lakes, emphasizing their broader implications for global GHG inventories. Thus, it advocates for sustained research efforts and conservation initiatives in this environmentally critical habitat.

Microplastics can accrue in high abundances in sediments of aquatic ecosystems while also contaminating pelagic filter feeders, which could transfer pollutants up trophic webs. We assess the abundance and distribution of microplastics in benthic sediments and Cladocera taxa in a subtropical Austral reservoir using a combination of geospatial techniques, physicochemical analyses, diversity indices, and multivariate statistics between two seasons (i.e., hot-wet and cool-dry). We found particularly high densities of microplastics during the cool-dry season for both sediments (mean 224.1 vs. 189 particles kg-1 dry weight) and Cladocera taxa (0.3 particles per individual). Cladocera microplastic shapes were dominated by fibers with high densities of the transparent color scheme. Pearson correlation results indicated that sediment microplastic abundances were negatively correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration, temperature, and resistivity, whereas they were positively correlated with pH and salinity during the hot-wet season, with no variables significant in the cool-dry season. Cladocera microplastic abundances were positively correlated with conductivity and salinity during the cool-dry season, but no variables in the hot-wet season. These findings provide insights into the role of reservoirs as microplastic retention sites and the potential for uptake and transfer from lower trophic groups. These insights can be used to strengthen future monitoring and intervention strategies. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2024;1-15. (c) 2024 SETAC Sediments and Cladocera taxa were dominated by fibers.

The establishment of drainage ditches aims at draining the excess of water from the farmland, particularly in areas where soils are saturated in the rainy season. The hydrogeomorphic impacts on the farmland itself and on downstream areas need however also to be studied. Off site, downstream problems comprise higher peak discharges, leading to gully initiation, an increase in sediment load, and flooding problems. On-site problems such as the development of the drainage ditches into (ephemeral) gullies are less documented, although they may be important, as illustrated in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia). The similarities and interactions between ephemeral gully channels and drainage ditches have to be considered to better understand all effects of drainage. Drainage ditches are a potential source of conflict between farmers with different interests and power, as well as between upstream and downstream users. A case study on drainage ditches on sloping farmlands in the Lake Tana Basin showed that nine out of ten catchments had drainage densities by ditches ranging from 53 to 510mha(-1). Drainage ditches were constructed with an average top width of 27 (+/- 9) cm.

As part of an ongoing study, we examined the annual dynamics of an established tubenose goby population from the River Dyje (Czech Republic, Danube basin), 13 years after its first occurrence. Monthly monitoring (February 2011-January 2012) confirmed that the species dominates the local fish assemblage (more than two thirds of fish caught) and is the only species captured every month. The population is female-dominated from March-August and displays a 1:1 sex-ratio from September on. Tubenose gobies in the Dyje are characterised by rapid reproduction and early maturation, with all 0+ fish ready to spawn at the start of the next spawning season. Females display significantly higher GSI but lower body condition and a shorter life-span than males. Female life-span was almost strictly annual, while males were more likely to survive to a second spawning season. This study is unique in presenting results for a tubenose goby population with long-term absence of other potentially competing gobiid species. These results provide new baseline data for future tubenose goby studies in areas both with and without competitors.					; Janac, Michal/F-9727-2014; Jurajdova, Zdenka/F-9648-2014; Mrkvova, Marketa/G-1107-2014; Jurajda, Pavel/F-9647-2014; Janáč, Michal/F-9727-2014	Jurajda, Pavel/0000-0002-4651-0415; Janac, Michal/0000-0001-6264-6091; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				JAN	2015	10	1					57	68		10.3391/ai.2015.10.1.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2015.10.1.06													WOS:000350746400006

The biomass was harvested during the peak standing crop in early September and divided into stems, leaves, flowers, roots and rhizomes. Concentrations of monitored elements in both aboveground and belowground plant tissues were similar to those found in plants growing in natural stands. The highest concentrations were recorded for Al, Fe, Mn, Ba and Zn while the lowest concentrations were those of Hg, U and Cd. Concentrations decreased in the order of roots > rhizomes > leaves > stems. The root/leaf ratio averaged 70 and varied between 1.4 for molybdenum and 392 for cobalt. The belowground/aboveground concentration ratio ranged between 0.9 and 69.5 with an average value of 19. Due to average aboveground/belowground biomass ratio > 1, the belowground/aboveground standing stock ratios were lower with six elements (Ba, Zn, Se, Hg, Mo, and Mn) having this ratio < 1.

Studies on historical changes in water level and its eco-social function can give insights into future water conservation and management. In this study, interannual and seasonal changes in the water level of Erhai Lake were analyzed from 1952 to 2019 to explore water level responses to human activities and climate change. The time series was divided into three distinct periods, i.e., 1952-1971, 1972-2003, and 2004-2019. Results showed that the water level and fluctuation amplitude differed among the different time periods, i.e., 1965.8 and 1.3 m (1952-1971), 1964.4 and 1.9 m (1972-2003), and 1965.2 and 1.2 m (1972-2003), respectively. The construction and operation of a hydroelectric power plant along the outlet river significantly decreased the water level and increased fluctuation amplitude in the 1972-2003 period. Since 2004, due to the implementation of local government water level management laws for Erhai Lake, the water level has remained relatively high, with moderate fluctuation amplitude. In addition, compared to the increase in water level amplitude in response to increased wet season (May-October) precipitation in the 1952-1971 period, response sensitivity increased in the 1972-2003 period, but became non-significant in the 2004-2019 period. In regard to the multi-timescale relationship between water level and precipitation, precipitation decreased by 89 mm in the 2004-2019 period compared with that from 1952 to 1971, and artificial water-level regulation resulted in a time-lag of 2, 3-3.5, and 4 months between water level and precipitation during the 1952-1971, 1972-2003, and 2004-2019 periods, respectively. The eco-social aspects of changes in water level are discussed below, and water level regulation from an ecological perspective is recommended to gain economic returns in the future.

We systematically examined and detailed the phytoplankton community's composition, spatial-temporal dynamics, and driving factors in this area. A total of 224 samples from 28 sampling sites across wet and dry seasons were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) the community structure of the main stream is more complex and stable than that of the tributaries; (2) the number of species, average cell abundance, and average biomass in the main stream were higher than those in the tributaries; (3) TN, TUR, WT, and pH were the main influencing factors for the difference in the phytoplankton community's structure between the main stream and the tributaries; (4) the phytoplankton community had a closer structure, higher connectivity, stronger resistance to environmental disturbance, and higher stability in the main stream, while those in the tributaries had higher interspecific synergy; and (5) the phytoplankton community's assembly process in the main stream was mainly influenced by random processes and was mainly driven by dispersal limitation in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River.					; zhang, peng/JOL-0040-2023	Ba, Sang/0000-0002-7927-8034; zhang, peng/0000-0002-0239-3923; 														2071-1050				APR 25	2023	15	9							7162	10.3390/su15097162	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097162													WOS:000988135900001

Four microhabitats were considered: sediment and the biofilms on dead wood, macrophytes and leaf litter. The relative contribution of the microhabitats to secondary production and the influence of environmental factors on meiofaunal density distribution were estimated. We expected (1) meiofaunal abundance and biomass to exhibit seasonal patterns, with more pronounced seasonal fluctuations on macrophytes and leaf litter than in the other microhabitats, (2) annual secondary production to be highest in sediment; however, the relative contribution of the microhabitats to monthly secondary production would change during the year, and (3) a bottom-up driven influence on meiofaunal density distribution in the microhabitats. Meiofaunal annual mean abundance, biomass and secondary production were 7-14 times higher in sediment and on dead wood than on macrophytes and leaf litter. Significant seasonal patterns described the meiofaunal abundance in sediment and on leaf litter as well as the biomass in sediment, on macrophytes and leaf litter. Organisms in sediment and on dead wood contributed 48 and 43%, respectively, to secondary production m(-2), but in regard to the stream area covered by the microhabitats, sediment had the highest share (80%). Significant determinants of the density distribution were AFDM, protozoans, bacteria and Chl-a, which influenced all meiofaunal groups. Our study clearly indicates that meiofaunal organisms in sediment and on dead wood have a remarkable share on total secondary production of lotic systems which is especially relevant for forested low-order streams.					; Traunspurger, Walter/KGL-7190-2024	Ptatscheck, Christoph/0000-0002-2079-4130; Traunspurger, Walter/0000-0002-9828-8430													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2020	54	4					1079	1095		10.1007/s10452-020-09795-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09795-5		SEP 2020											WOS:000566364000001

Diurnal variability and biogeochemical reactivity of mercury species in an extreme high-altitude lake ecosystem of the Bolivian Altiplano	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Methylation and demethylation represent major transformation pathways regulating the net production of methylmercury (MMHg). Very few studies have documented Hg reactivity and transformation in extreme high-altitude lake ecosystems. Mercury (Hg) species concentrations (IHg, MMHg, HgA degrees, and DMHg) and in situ Hg methylation (M) and MMHg demethylation (D) potentials were determined in water, sediment, floating organic aggregates, and periphyton compartments of a shallow productive Lake of the Bolivian Altiplano (Uru Uru Lake, 3686 m). Samples were collected during late dry season (October 2010) and late wet season (May 2011) at a north (NS) and a south (SS) site of the lake, respectively. Mercury species concentrations exhibited significant diurnal variability as influenced by the strong diurnal biogeochemical gradients. Particularly high methylated mercury concentrations (0.2 to 4.5 ng L-1 for MMHgT) were determined in the water column evidencing important Hg methylation in this ecosystem. Methylation and D potentials range were, respectively, < 0.1-16.5 and < 0.2-68.3 % day(-1) and were highly variable among compartments of the lake, but always higher during the dry season. Net Hg M indicates that the influence of urban and mining effluent (NS) promotes MMHg production in both water (up to 0.45 ng MMHg L-1 day(-1)) and sediment compartments (2.0 to 19.7 ng MMHg g(-1) day(-1)). While the sediment compartment appears to represent a major source of MMHg in this shallow ecosystem, floating organic aggregates (dry season, SS) and Totora's periphyton (wet season, NS) were found to act as a significant source (5.8 ng MMHg g(-1) day(-1)) and a sink (-2.1 ng MMHg g(-1) day(-1)) of MMHg, respectively. This work demonstrates that high-altitude productive lake ecosystems can promote MMHg formation in various compartments supporting recent observations of high Hg contents in fish and water birds.					; Goni Urriza, Marisol/F-1843-2013; monperrus, mathilde/B-7946-2009; Point, David/GOE-5433-2022; Acha, Dario/A-3547-2011; Audry, Stéphane/ABF-8717-2020	Audry, Stephane/0000-0002-5075-1262; Amouroux, David/0000-0002-0056-8590; monperrus, mathilde/0000-0002-6337-1672; Garcia Moreno, Maria Eugenia/0000-0001-7881-6892; Point, David/0000-0002-5218-7781; Acha, Dario/0000-0002-9498-069X; Goni Urriza, Marisol/0000-0001-7694-6511; Guyoneaud, Remy/0000-0001-6278-0872; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	7					6919	6933		10.1007/s11356-015-5917-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5917-1								26676541					WOS:000373632400085

However, little is known of how terrestrial environments responded to these climate changes because the continental ice sheet covered most Antarctic coastal oases during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), eliminating terrestrial records. In this study, the environmental history spanning the last 25,400 years was reconstructed using geochronology, lithology, rock magnetism and geochemistry to understand the effect of glacial-deglacial climate variations on surface processes and Mochou Lake ecology. During the last glacial period (25.4 to 18.8 cal. kyr BP), intensified winds and the freeze-thaw action of ice actively weathered the high elevation western catchment that was a dominant sediment source to the lake. The glacial environmental conditions induced a persistent perennial lake ice-cover resulting in anoxia, low sedimentation, primary production and weak brackish conditions. Progressively, as deglacial conditions augmented around 18.8 cal. kyr BP, increased catchment meltwater flow enhanced sediment transport and also transformed the lake into a freshwater basin, although perennial ice-cover still prevailed. Further, the biotic development of the lake began later in the Mid-Holocene as compared to other lakes in the region, wherein the seasonal lake ice cycle and/or ice moat developed. Weak chemical weathering and pedogenesis also commenced in the catchment in response to the warming climate trend. This delayed response to the Holocene warming was possibly due to the local cooling effect of the Dalk Glacier's discharge that also led to sea-ice persistence in the Prydz Bay. This study also provides further evidence that parts of the Larsemann Hills remained free of erosive grounded ice during the LGM and subsequent deglaciation. The Mirror Peninsula, specifically, escaped ice overriding despite being enclosed by the Dalk Glacier, Lake Nella ice lobe and Amery Ice Shelf.

The origin and the exact stratigraphic position of the assemblage have been controversial for a long time. In this study, petrographic observations on the bauxite pebbles revealed common features with Cretaceous bauxite deposits known in the region, whereas heavy mineral composition of the red clay matrix is similar to those known from the Eocene bauxite horizon of the region. Single grain zircon U-Pb ages obtained from the bauxite pebbles and their red clayey matrix show similar late Archean to Jurassic age components. Additionally, Cenozoic U-Pb ages are well represented in the mostly euhedral zircon crystals separated from the red clays, whereas this volcanogenic contribution completely missing from the bauxite pebbles. SEM morphology and related EDX chemical analysis of clay minerals indicate polygenetic, detrital origin for the red clays. The main source material of the bauxite bearing Vorosto Formation is most probably local Cretaceous and Eocene bauxite deposits exposed during the middle-late Miocene. These tropical weathering products were partly decomposed and degraded, but dilution by siliciclastic contribution is negligible. We suggest a transport mechanism dominated by local redeposition of mostly pelitic and allitic material through seasonal muddy debris flows within a karstic landscape. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Schultze, SR; Sabbatini, P; Luo, LF				Schultze, Steven R.; Sabbatini, Paolo; Luo, Lifeng			Effects of a warming trend on cool climate viticulture in Michigan, USA	SPRINGERPLUS												Historically, Michigan's climate had mainly three challenges for grape production: growing season temperatures were too low, the growing season was too short and there was too much rain near harvest. However, climate change in the past decades has led to a vastly different landscape that is evolving to meet the new climate. Recently, there has been a significant move from Vitis labrusca (North American) grape plantings to Vitis vinifera (wine grapes) as a consequence of Michigan's shifting climate. The goal of this study was to analyze the historical shift in climate and its potential future impact on the grape industry. We obtained data climate model projection data from two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. First, a multi-linear regression model was built to predict future grape yields (t/ac) using data from the climate model projections. Second, trends in the severity of the three challenges (temperature, season length, precipitation timing) were analyzed. In both GHG scenarios grape yields are seen to improve, but to different extents. The improvement is likely a response to warmer season temperatures canceling out losses to early season frost. Model projections recommend that Michigan's future climate will be more accommodating for all varieties of grapes. This suggests that grape production will continue to grow, but the landscape will continue to evolve with more emphasis on varieties that are more climatically sensitive to cold temperatures. Climate change has greatly affected Michigan's viticultural landscape, and will continue to do so in the coming decades.					; Luo, Lifeng/C-8734-2009; Sabbatini, Paolo/AAM-2472-2020	Sabbatini, Paolo/0000-0002-1610-4491; Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104; 													2193-1801					JUL 19	2016	5								1119	10.1186/s40064-016-2777-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2777-1								27478736					WOS:000381635900012

Differences in UV transparency and thermal structure between alpine and subalpine lakes: implications for organisms	PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a globally important abiotic factor influencing ecosystem structure and function in multiple ways. While UV radiation can be damaging to most organisms, several factors act to reduce UV exposure of organisms in aquatic ecosystems, the most important of which is dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In alpine lakes, very low concentrations of DOC and a thinner atmosphere lead to unusually high UV exposure levels. These high UV levels combine with low temperatures to provide a fundamentally different vertical structure to alpine lake ecosystems in comparison to most lowland lakes. Here, we discuss the importance of water temperature and UV transparency in structuring alpine lake ecosystems and the consequences for aquatic organisms that inhabit them. We present transparency data on a global data set of alpine lakes and nearby analogous subalpine lakes for comparison. We also present seasonal transparency data on a suite of alpine and subalpine lakes that demonstrate important differences in UV and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) transparency patterns even within a single region. These data are used to explore factors regulating transparency in alpine lakes, to discuss implications of future environmental change on the structure and function of alpine lakes, and ways in which the UV transparency of these lakes can be used as a sentinel of environmental change.

In the center of the western basin, bacteriochlorophyll e (BChl e) was detected between depths of 90 and 120 m and reached maxima of 54 and 68 ng liter(-1). High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed a dominance of farnesyl esters and the presence of four unusual geranyl ester homologs of BChl e. Only traces of BChl e (8 ng liter(-1)) were found at the northwestern slope of the Black Sea basin, where the chemocline was positioned at a significantly greater depth of 140 m. Stable carbon isotope fractionation values of farnesol indicated an autotrophic growth mode of the green sulfur bacteria. For the first time, light intensities in the Black Sea chemocline were determined employing an integrating quantum meter, which yielded maximum values between 0.0022 and 0.00075 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) at the top of the green sulfur bacterial layer around solar noon in December. These values represent by far the lowest values reported for any habitat of photosynthetic organisms. Only one 16S rRNA gene sequence type was detected in the chemocline using PCR primers specific for green sulfur bacteria. This previously unknown phylotype groups with the marine cluster of the Chlorobiaceae and was successfully enriched in a mineral medium containing sulfide, dithionite, and freshly prepared yeast extract. Under precisely controlled laboratory conditions, the enriched green sulfur bacterium proved to be capable of exploiting light intensities as low as 0.015 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) for photosynthetic (CO2)-C-14 fixation. Calculated in situ doubling times of the green sulfur bacterium range between 3.1 and 26 years depending on the season, and anoxygenic photosynthesis contributes only 0.002 to 0.01% to total sulfide oxidation in the chemocline. The stable population of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea chemocline thus represents the most extremely low-light-adapted and slowest-growing type of phototroph known to date.

Remote Sensing Assessment of Water Resources, Vegetation, and Land Surface Temperature in Eastern Saudi Arabia: Identification, Variability, and Trends	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Saudi Arabia has one of the biggest water shortages and the least vegetation in the world, which is presumed to provoke this problem further due to climate change. Therefore, the present study investigates the water, vegetation, and temperature over Al-Asfar Lake region, Al Ahsa, Eastern province of Saudi Arabia using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST: degrees C) from Landsat-8 based operational land imager (OLI) measurements for the period 2013 to 2023. This study presented annual and seasonal (dry months: June-September and wet months: December-April) spatiotemporal distribution and variations, calculated their absolute change and trends, and examined their relationship. Results showed positive NDWI values over Al-Asfar Lake, indicating waterbodies; while positive NDVI values on the lake's bank, signifying vegetation. Notably, there were significant temporal variations in water and vegetation observed on annual, seasonal, and monthly scales. The study also found an overall decrease in vegetation areas of 5.36 km2 in 2023 compared to 2013, while waterbodies increased by 8.83 km2. The trend analysis using area-averaged data demonstrated that NDWI increased on annual (0.0075/year) and seasonal (dry: 0.0083/year and wet: 0.0049/year) scales, while NDVI decreased (annual: 0.0066/year, dry: 0.0083/year, and wet: 0.0009/year). Moreover, LST was recorded least amount over waterbodies (28.23 degrees C) and vegetation (32.45 degrees C) covered areas compared to the entire lake region (38.43 degrees C), respectively. Remark, LST displayed decreasing trends over waterbodies (-0.05/year), followed by vegetation (-0.17/year), and the entire lake region (-0.0001/year), signifying that water and vegetation are vital components to controlling land surface temperature in this region. Finally, the LST showed a positive correlation with NDVI and negative correlation with NDWI. There may be a direct and indirect impact of climate change upon NDVI, LST, and NDWI as shown by the decreases in NDVI and LST and an increase in NDWI. This study can be considered as a base document to monitor waterbodies, vegetation cover, and temperature changes using remote sensing measurements of NDWI, NDVI, and LST, which will assist policymakers in developing water re- source management, irrigation planning, and environmental monitoring strategies.					; Ali, Md.

In Cambodia, where 90% of the cultivated land is used for rice production, rodent damage to rice can cause significant impacts to smallholder farmers' livelihoods and to food security. To help smallholder farmers minimize yield losses from rodent pests, adaptive research experiments were established in two villages in Takeo province. In each village, three replicate 5-ha sites were selected for treatment and three for control. In each treatment site, groups of farmers implemented ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM) methods over two rice cropping seasons. The management methods were adapted based on the local situation and preferred practices of farmers and included maintaining basic hygiene in field margins, synchronous planting of rice crops, community rat hunts, no electric fencing and the implementation of a Community Trap Barrier System (CTBS) along with a Linear Trap Barrier System (LTBS) in an area of intensive rice monoculture, and a LTBS with targeted and limited bromadiolone rodenticide in an area growing recession rice on lake margins. Over 130 rats were caught at each treatment site per season and rodent damage levels were reduced from a mean of 22-34% per site and season in the non-treatment sites to less than 6% in the treatment sites. Following the implementation of EBRM, rice yields were, on average, 20-32% higher in the treatment sites than in the non-treatment sites, giving a 53-169% increase in net income and a benefit-cost ratio ranging from 3:1 to 11:1 per season. We show that rodent damage to rice in Cambodia and the associated yield loss can be significantly reduced following the implementation of cost-efficient EBRM approaches that were locally adapted to village-specific agro-ecological and social conditions. We conclude by discussing incentives that support the adoption of these practices by smallholder farming communities.

Gender specific patterns of carbon uptake and water use in a dominant riparian tree species exposed to a warming climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Air temperatures in the arid western United States are predicted to increase over the next century. These increases will likely impact the distribution of plant species, particularly dioecious species that show a spatial segregation of the sexes across broad resource gradients. On the basis of spatial segregation patterns, we hypothesized that temperature increases will have a greater negative impact on female plants compared with co-occurring male plants of dioecious species. This hypothesis was tested by examining the whole-plant carbon and water relations of 10-year-old female (n=18) and male (n=13) Acer negundo Sarg. trees grown in a common garden in Salt Lake City, UT. The trees were established from cuttings collected where the growing season temperature averaged about 6.5 degrees C cooler than at the common garden. During May and June, stem sap flux (J(s)) was similar between genders, but averaged 25% higher in males during the warmer months of July and August. Daytime canopy stomatal conductance (g(s)) per unit leaf area was 12% higher in females in May:June, but was 11% higher in males in July:August. We combined measurements of sap flux-scaled transpiration with measurements of tree allometry and C-13 of leaf soluble sugars to estimate whole-tree carbon assimilation (A(tree)) and water use efficiency (WUE) (A(tree):E-tree). A(tree) was similar between genders until late August when A(tree) was 32% higher in male trees. A(tree):E-tree was on average 7% higher in females than in males during the growing season. Patterns of J(s), g(s), A(tree) and A(tree):E-tree in the present study were in contrast to those previously reported for A. negundo genders under native growing season temperatures. Results suggest that the spatial segregation of the sexes could shift under global warming such that female plants lose their dominance in high-resource habitats, and males increase their dominance in relatively lower-resource habitats.

The temperature (T), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total phosphorus (TP), and concentrations of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn and As) of the samples were measured. The results showed that the average concentrations of heavy metals in the mainstream of the Xiujiang River were Cu > Zn > Cr > As, and those in the main tributary of Xiujiang River (named as the Liaohe tributary) were Zn > Cu > Cr > As, which met the class III of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water in China. However, it was founded that TN and NH4+-N in some agricultural areas had not met the class III standard of surface water. Hierarchical clustering analysis grouped sampling sites into four clusters. Clusters 1, cluster 2, cluster 3, and cluster 4 corresponded to an urban industrial area, rural mountainous area, primitive mountainous area, and agricultural area, respectively. The majority of the sampling sites were classified as mountainous rural areas less impacted by human activities, while the Liaohe tributary were urban industrial areas impacted more by human activities. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis results showed that variation of heavy metals and nutrient elements in Xiujiang River is related to the heterogeneity of human activities, which is mainly affected by urban industrial and agricultural pollution, and natural environments of the river with different background values. The results obtained in the current study will potentially provide a scientific basis for the protection and management of freshwater resources and aquatic ecosystems in the Xiujiang River and Poyang Lake Basin.

J	Bliem, R; Reischer, G; Linke, R; Farnleitner, A; Kirschner, A				Bliem, Rupert; Reischer, Georg; Linke, Rita; Farnleitner, Andreas; Kirschner, Alexander			Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae in Turbid Alkaline Lakes as Determined by Quantitative PCR	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In recent years, global warming has led to a growing number of Vibrio cholerae infections in bathing water users in regions formerly unaffected by this pathogen. It is therefore of high importance to monitor V. cholerae in aquatic environments and to elucidate the main factors governing its prevalence and abundance. For this purpose, rapid and standardizable methods that can be performed by routine water laboratories are prerequisite. In this study, we applied a recently developed multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) strategy (i) to monitor the spatiotemporal variability of V. cholerae abundance in two small soda pools and a large lake that is intensively used for recreation and (ii) to elucidate the main factors driving V. cholerae dynamics in these environments. V. cholerae was detected with qPCR at high concentrations of up to 970,000 genomic units 100 ml(-1) during the warm season, up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than values obtained by cultivation. An independent cytometric approach led to results comparable to qPCR data but with significantly more positive samples due to problems with DNA recovery for qPCR. Not a single sample was positive for toxigenic V. cholerae, indicating that only nontoxigenic V. cholerae (NTVC) was present. Temperature was the main predictor of NTVC abundance, but the quality and quantity of dissolved organic matter were also important environmental correlates. Based on this study, we recommend using the developed qPCR strategy for quantification of toxigenic and nontoxigenic V. cholerae in bathing waters with the need for improvements in DNA recovery. IMPORTANCE There is a definitive need for rapid and standardizable methods to quantify waterborne bacterial pathogens. Such methods have to be thoroughly tested for their applicability to environmental samples. In this study, we critically tested a recently developed multiplex qPCR strategy for its applicability to determine the spatiotemporal variability of V. cholerae abundance in lakes with a challenging water matrix. Several qPCR protocols for V. cholerae detection have been developed in the laboratory, but comprehensive studies on the application to environmental samples are extremely scarce. In our study, we demonstrate that our developed qPCR approach is a valuable tool but that there is a need for improvement in DNA recovery for complex water matrices. Furthermore, we found that nontoxigenic V. cholerae is present in very high numbers in the investigated ecosystems, while toxigenic V. cholerae is apparently absent. Such information is of importance for public health.					; Reischer, Georg/N-6381-2017	Farnleitner, Andreas/0000-0002-0542-5425; Reischer, Georg/0000-0002-3962-8685; Kirschner, Alexander/0000-0002-9797-3073													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	2018	84	11							e00317	10.1128/AEM.00317-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00317-18								29625977					WOS:000432467000008

Palaeosols and calcretes formed within these terrestrial sedimentary rocks under near-surface or surface conditions. The palaeosols are composed predominantly of smectite +/- illite with feldspar, quartz, calcite, opal-CT, and amphibole, and the calcretes mainly of calcite with minor feldspar, quartz, and accessory smectite +/- palygorskite. The palygorskite occurs on and between the calcite crystals in the calcretes and at the edges of smectite flakes within the palaeosols, indicating an in situ formation from evaporated alkaline water rich in Si and Mg and poor in Al under arid or seasonally arid climatic conditions. In the palaeosols and calcretes, negative Ba, Nb, Ce, Sr, and Ti anomalies and an enrichment of light rare earth elements relative to medium rare earth elements and heavy rare earth elements, with a distinct negative Eu anomaly, likely reflect the alteration of feldspars and amphiboles in the ignimbrite. The alteration of the ignimbrites caused the depletion of SiO2, Al2O3+Fe2O3, TiO2, and K2O through the precipitation of smectite +/- illite in the palaeosols and CaO in the form of calcite in the calcretes. The delta O-18 values of the calcretes and limestones range from -8.71% to -10.71%, which are mainly related to the involvement of high-elevation meteoric water, whereas the delta C-13 values for the same rocks vary between -1.97% and 5.71%. The positive delta C-13 values for the limestones reflect calcite precipitation in isotopic equilibrium with meteoric water in a lake. The slightly negative delta C-13 values of the lacustrine limestone carbonates may indicate precipitation from a relatively thick water column and an inflow of surface or groundwater through the ignimbrites with high Ba/Sr values. Conversely, the calcrete delta C-13 values (3.0% to 4.97%) may suggest a pedogenic origin with low plant respiration rates and a predominance of C-4 plants. Based on stable oxygen isotope values from the lake sediments and calcretes, this study suggests that the global warming trend that followed the Late Miocene continued into the Pliocene within the CVP.

In this study, the isotopic signatures of primary producers and consumers were determined, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis and mixing models were combined to investigate the influence of water levels on the diet and isotopic composition of Poyang Lake fish and invertebrates. Five potential food sources (seston, benthic organic matter, aquatic macrophytes, attached algae, and terrestrial plants), 4 species of invertebrates, and 10 species of fish were collected from the lake area during dry and wet seasons between January 2009 and April 2010. The delta C-13 values of invertebrates and most fish were within the range of delta C-13 values of the potential food sources for both seasons. The delta C-13 values of invertebrates and most fish were lower in the dry season than in the wet season, whereas the delta N-15 values exhibited different patterns for different species. Mixing models indicated that the most important food sources for common lake fauna were seston in the dry season and aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial plants in the wet season. The fauna were more omnivorous in the wet season than in the dry season. The food web dynamics of Poyang Lake are strongly influenced by changes in the abundance and accessibility of different basal food sources that occur because of seasonal flood pulses. The trophic links within the aquatic communities of Poyang Lake are modified by water-level fluctuations.

However, limited information is available about the OPEs in the estuary organism categories, especially under the multiple industrial pressure. This study investigated the occurrence, bioaccumulation and human consumption implication in wild marine organisms from the Yellow River Estuary, where located many petroleum and chemical manufacturing industries. This study found that concentrations of Sigma 13OPEs ranged from 547 ng/L to 1164 ng/L in seawater (median: 802 ng/L), from 384 to 1366 ng/g dw in the sediment (median: 601 ng/g dw), and from 419 to 959 ng/g dw (median: 560 ng/g dw) in the marine organisms. The congener compositions in the organisms were dominated by alkyl-OPEs (80.7 %), followed by halogenated-OPEs (18.8 %) and aryl-OPEs (0.5 %). Based on the principal component analysis, petrochemical pollution, and industrial wastewater discharge were distinguished as the main plausible sources of OPEs to the YRE ecosystem. Most OPEs had potential or strong bioaccumulation capacity on the organisms, with a positive correlation between log BAF (Bioaccumulation Factor) and log Kow of OPEs. The highest estimated daily intake value of OPEs was tri-n-propyl phosphate, exceeding 300 ng/kg & sdot;bw/day via consuming fish. The highest hazard quotients from OPEs ranged from 0.001 to 0.1, indicating a low risk to human health by consuming marine organisms in the YRE. As the consumption of OPEs increases year by year, the risks of OPEs still cannot be ignored.

J	Bowen, BB; Benison, KC				Bowen, Brenda Beitler; Benison, Kathleen C.			Geochemical characteristics of naturally acid and alkaline saline lakes in southern Western Australia	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					7th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry	DEC, 2006	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Abundant shallow saline lakes on the Archean Yilgarn Craton in southern Western Australia exhibit a rare spectrum of geochemical conditions. Here the field geochemistry over three seasons (pH, salinity, and temperature), as well as major ions, trace elements, and H, O, and S stable isotopes of surface waters and shallow groundwaters from 59 ephemeral takes in southern Western Australia (WA) are reported. Approximately 40% of the lakes and 84% of the measured groundwaters in WA are extremely acidic (pH < 4) and pHs are observed as low as 1.7. The salinity of lake waters and groundwaters ranges from rare freshwaters to common saline waters and brines with total dissolved solids >28%. The fluids are typically Na-Cl to Na-Mg-Cl-SO4 brines with variable yet locally high amounts of Ca, K, Al, Fe, Si, and Br. The acid brine fluid compositions are unusual. For example, in some fluids the amount of Al >> Ca, the amount of Br > K, and comparison of total S to SO42- values suggest the presence of other uncommon S-bearing species. Trends in delta O-18 and delta(2) H illustrate the separation between surface lake water and shallow groundwaters, and indicate the contribution of meteoric waters to the lakes. The chemical and isotopic compositions of these fluids indicate a spatially and temporally dynamic, yet regionally consistent, history of brine evolution that is fundamentally different from most other terrestrial closed basin brines. The WA lake brines do not evolve from surface evaporation of dilute inflow waters, but rather are fed by highly evolved regionally acid saline groundwaters. The lake waters then diversify with locally varying surface and near-surface processes such as meteoric dilution by flooding, evapoconcentration, mineral precipitation and dissolution, and fluid mixing. The WA lake waters and groundwaters are somewhat similar to those in an entirely different geologic setting in northeastern Victoria, illustrating the potential for different geochemical pathways to lead to the formation of similar lacustrine acid brines. Although these types of environments are rare in modern settings, ancient ephemeral acid saline lake deposits have been recognized in the geologic record on Earth and on Mars, indicating that natural evolution of acid saline waters may be more ubiquitous than previously recognized.

However, as a sensitive zone in reservoir, little is known about the geochemical process and ecotoxicological risk of arsenic (As) in WLFZ soils under the anti-seasonal flow regulation. Hence, the anthropogenic contamination, mobility and ecotoxicological risks of As in WLFZ soils of the TGR were comprehensively assessed using the geochemical baseline concentration (GBC), chemical fractions, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and toxicity data. The As concentrations in WLFZ soils showed a trend of increasing at the early stage of water impoundment and then stabilizing in recent years, which presented a low ecological risk of As according to the assessment by pollution indices. Based on GBC calculations, the average anthropogenic contribution of As was 13.95 %, indicating a slight influence of human activities. The distribution of labile As measured by DGT in WLFZ soils was mainly controlled by the Fe/Mn oxides, pH and organic matter. The DGT-induced fluxes in soils (DIFS) model further implied that resupply of As to soil solution was partially sustained by the soil solid phase, in which the resupply capacity was low and limited by the adsorption and desorption kinetics. In addition, the DGT was combined with toxicity data to obtain the risk quotient (RQ) and probabilistic risk assessment. The RQ value was lower than 1, indicating a low toxicity risk in WLFZ soils. Furthermore, the As in WLFZ soils had a low probability (5.97E-3 % and 7.77E-2 % in the mainstream and tributary, respectively) of toxic effects toward the aquatic biota. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation for the mobility and toxicity risk of As in WLFZ soils, which is beneficial to the prevention and control of heavy metals pollution in the riparian soils of lakes and reservoirs.

In this study, we analyzed the population dynamics of Campylobacter and Arcobacter group bacteria (AGB) in a freshwater lake in Japan over two years. The bacteria were quantified by using both culture-dependent and-independent methods. The potential sources of these bacteria were examined by a highthroughputflaA sequencing approach. Campylobacter was abundantly detected both by culture-dependent and-independent methods in the lake, especially when migratory geese were present in the lake. High-throughput flaA sequencing suggests that geese were the likely source of Campylobacter in the lake. The viable population of Campylobacter exceeds the concentrations that can potentially cause 10(-4) infections per person per year when water is used to grow fresh vegetables. The occurrence of AGB, on the other hand, was not directly related to the population of migratory geese. AGB were not detected in geese fecal samples. Diverse AGB flaA genotypes occurred in the lake over multiple seasons. Our results suggest that AGB likely comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population of the lake and grow in response to high nutrient, warm temperature, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake. Geese therefore can indirectly impact the AGB population by providing nutrients to cause eutrophication and lower the dissolved oxygen concentration.

The 100m spatial resolution of WaPOR data base was used to acquire the satellite data used for water productivity estimation. The average crop water productivity was 7.5kg/m(3) at Wonji, 7kg/m(3) at Fincha'a and 4.3kg/m(3) at Metahara irrigation schemes respectively during time period of January 1/2009 to June 30/2019. Some plots located at Dodota, Sodare and Wake-Tiyo of Wonji scheme show high water productivity during time period of January 1/2018 to June 30/2019. But the value of water productivity show decreasing at Wonji main scheme during time period of January 1/2012 to June 30/2013. At Fincha'a irrigation scheme the high-water productivity was observed at most plots located at northern part of East Bank site, northern part of West Bank site and southern part of Neshie site during the study period of January 1/2009 to June 30/2019. And low water productivity at Fincha'a was observed at plots located at northern part of Neshie site, southern part of East and West Bank site. At Metahara irrigation scheme, some plots located near Basaka lake and northern part of the scheme, show low water productivity and some plots located at southern part of the scheme show high water productivity.

As such, it proves a very useful experimental site for the study of sea ice processes, the inter-comparison of methods, the testing of equipment, and the training of researchers new to the Polar regions. In this contribution, we describe a physical, chemical, and ecosystem survey at Saroma-ko Lagoon, conducted over February 23-28, 2019 under the auspices of the SLOPE2019 (Saroma-ko Lagoon Observations for sea ice Physico-chemistry and Ecosystems 2019) program. Sea ice cores were collected to examine temperature, salinity, oxygen isotopic ratio, thin sections, and chemical and biological parameters such as carbonate chemistry, CH4, nutrients, chlorophyll a concentrations, and ice algae community assemblage. Broadband and spectral irradiance measurements were carried out above/under the sea ice, and different sensors were inter-compared at close positions and environments. Equipment such as spectrometers, air.sea ice CO2/CH4 flux chamber, and under-ice turbulent heat flux systems were tested for future Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. Finally, an artificial pool was dug into the sea ice to understand the effect of snow particles on ice growth and to compare the gas exchange process over sea ice with an ice-free water surface. Our SLOPE2019 field campaign activities provided useful information for intercomparison work and future sea ice research in the polar oceans.

The U-238 concentration and the activity ratios of U-234/U-238 ([U-234/U-238](AR)) showed that there was no significant change in the same lake, but there was a certain degree of difference in the distribution between different lakes. We found that aqueous U-238 concentration within a certain range increased with an increase in TDS (total dissolved solid) and salinity, as was also the case with pH. As in natural waters, the pH affects the speciation of U-238, but TDS and salinity affect the adsorption process of aqueous U-238. Further, the replenishment of water will also affect the uranium isotope concentration for lakes, but it is not the main influencing factor for saline lakes. Therefore, we suggest that pH is the dominant factor affecting changes in aqueous U-238 concentration of the sampled saline lakes. The [U-234/U-238](AR) in these saline lakes are closely related to the input water and the associated water-rock interactions involving sediments, atmosphere dust, and organic material, etc. during the evolution stage, metamorphous degree, and hydrochemistry of the saline lakes. Lake water samples collected in the maximum and minimum discharge water period, were used to evaluate the seasonal distribution characteristics of aqueous U-238, and we found that U-238 concentration did not show an evident change with the seasons in these saline lakes. If the U-238 concentration and [U-234/U-238](AR) can remain consistent during a period of time, then the sediment ages and/or sedimentation rates could be determined by lake sediment and/or biogenic carbonate in future, thus allowing for the accurate reconstruction of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment.

Validation of 2015 Lake Erie MODIS image spectral decomposition using visible derivative spectroscopy and field campaign data	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Timely identification of color-producing agents (CPAs) in Lake Erie is a challenging, but vital aspect of monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs). In particular, HABs that include large amounts of cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs) can be toxic to humans, posing a threat to drinking water, in addition to recreational and economic use of lake Erie. The optical signal of lake Erie is complex (Becker et al., 2009; Moore et al., 2017), typically comprised of phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), detritus, and terrigenous inorganic particles, varying in composition both spatially and temporally. The Kent State University (KSU) spectral decomposition method effectively partitions CPAs using a varimax-rotated, principal component analysis (VPCA) of visible reflectance spectra measured using lab, field or satellite instruments (Ali et al., 2013; Ortiz et al., 2017, 2013). We analyze 2015 imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and field samples collected during the early 2015 cyanoHAB season. We identified four primary CPA spectral signatures, and the spatial distribution of each identified CPA, in the reflectance spectra datasets of both the MODIS and lab-measured water samples. The KSU spectral decomposition method results in mixtures of specific pigments, pigment degradation products, and minerals that describe the optically complex water. We found very good agreement between the KSU VPCA spectral decomposition results and in situ measurements, indicating that this method may be a powerful tool for rapid CyanoHAB monitoring and assessment in large lakes using instruments that provide moderate resolution imagery (03 to 1 km(2)).

Nitrogen and Phosphorus Budget for a Deep Tropical Reservoir of the Brazilian Savannah	WATER												This research investigated the source and fate of different chemical species of N and P on a deep tropical urban reservoir, the artificial Lake Paranoa, located in the city of Brasilia (Brazil). To determine an N and P budget, nutrient input from the external load (four main tributaries and two wastewater treatment plants), internal load (from sediment) and nutrient output (from a downstream dam) were estimated empirically. Nutrient storage was evaluated in two compartments: water column and sediment. Nutrient input from the tributaries varied by season presenting higher loads in the wet season, especially N. Nutrient budgets in our study indicated that Lake Paranoa retained dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), PO43--P, total organic phosphorus (TOP) and exported total organic nitrogen (TON), both on a seasonal and annual scale. Surface sediment is the major storage compartment for both N and P. These results show the pressing need for action to reduce the P outcome charges, mainly, from the wastewater treatment plants. The data here presented contributes to the recognition of this situation and to a better comprehension of these nutrient dynamics, as well as an understanding of the behavior of tropical deep-water reservoirs. This can help to promote more effective management, providing a reference for other similar systems.

However, previous study of this phenomenon has focused mainly on the effects of regional precipitation, rather than effects of groundwater recharge, on arid-zone environmental change. We selected a sedimentary profile from a seasonal lake basin located in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, northwestern China, to assess the Holocene environmental evolution of this region and its response to climate change. Our results show that peat deposition from 11 to 10 ka indicates humidification after Younger Dryas (YD) event; the lake sediment and lower EM2 and lower principal component analysis (PCA)-1 scores indicate relative more humid environment from 10 to 7.8 ka; the lake sediment and higher EM2 and higher PCA-1 scores indicate most humid environment from 7.8 to 5.8 ka; the transition from lacustrine facies to limnetic facies and increasing salinity indicate drying trend from 5.8 to 2.5 ka; the aeolian sand sediment and lowest EM2 and lowest PCA-1 scores indicate driest environment from 2.5 to 0.8 ka; and lacustrine facies and finest grain size indicate relative humid environment during the 'Little Ice Age' period. The environment was relative humid in early Holocene, most Humid in mid-Holocene, and dry in mid-late Holocene. The moisture pattern in the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert was synchronous with that in the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau, which implies that the groundwater recharge lake was dominated by the intensity of groundwater recharge from monsoon margin area, especially the northeastern of Tibetan Plateau. As a record from groundwater recharge lake without runoff, our study provides the groundwater output quantity record from northeastern of Tibetan Plateau and would benefit the environment change research and regional water resources allocation around the Tibetan Plateau.

The Marizal Formation is interpreted as a fluvial system developed in the inherited rift axis of the Tucano Basin. In its middle portion, after a quick transgressive event, a mud dominated interval took place, which is enclosed in the Amargosa Bed. This transgressive marker bed is rich in fish fossils with Tethyan affinity attesting to an estuarine environment in the southern portions of the basin. The same transgressive event occurs in the Barbalha Formation of the Araripe Basin, where a mud-dominated lacustrine system is interpreted in the Batateira Bed. While lakes developed in the Araripe Basin and a transitional marine environment is attested to the southern portions of the Tucano Basin, there is no information of how these systems were interconnected. Here we discuss sedimentologic, stratigraphic and geochemical data of the Amargosa Bed in the North Tucano Basin, correlating it with time equivalent marker beds of other locations in the Northeast Brazil. Our data show that deposition of the mixed carbonate-mud interval of the North Tucano Basin was developed in a saline lake with local evidences of seismic-induced soft-sediment deformation structures. Although climate seasonality controlled high-frequency base-level changes, our findings reveal that local fault reactivation was responsible for the space generation, triggering the lake formation in the basin depocenter. This situation is uncommon for thermal subsiding basins that lack mechanical influence and have several implications for the evolution of intracontinental rift basins of the Brazilian Cretaceous. Also, lakes from Araripe, Jatoba and North Tucano basins were probably connected by the continental paleodrainage existent in the Aptian, carrying sediments to the estuaries developed in the Central and South Tucano basins and, thus, to the developing South Atlantic Ocean.

However, it is difficult to obtain this relationship accurately, especially for large floodplain lakes that exhibit time-varying boundaries with rapid water-level fluctuations. Taking the largest lake-floodplain system of the Yangtze River basin - Poyang Lake and its extremely productive wetland - as an example, we investigated the spatial-temporal variation of the stage-area hysteretic relationship in large het-erogeneous lake-floodplain systems by adopting the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflection Fusion Model (ESTARFM) based on the observed water levels and reconstructed high spatial-temporal resolution inundation datasets using multi-source remote sensing data. The major results indicate that the inundation dynamics in the regions of the main lake and seasonal floodplain lakes are remarkably inconsistent. Concerning the inundation behavior of the river and lake-floodplain, a conceptual model was established to explain the formation mechanism of the counter-clockwise and clockwise stage-area hysteretic relationships in the Poyang lake-floodplain system. Further investigation revealed that seasonal lakes exist widely in floodplain settings and have a crucial impact on increasing the hysteresis of upstream stations and decreasing that of downstream stations. The magnitude and direction of the stage-area hysteretic relationships varied with time in a changin-g environment. This study extends the understanding of the complexity of hydrological behavior in large het-erogeneous lake-floodplain systems, which is of vital importance for lake water resources and ecological management.					; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; Ye, Xuchun/0000-0001-8408-8318													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		B						129507	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129507		APR 2023											WOS:000984524000001

Spatial and temporal trends of polychlorinated biphenyls in water and sediment from Nairobi River, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are chemicals that have become ubiquitous environmental pollutants due to their past use, persistence, and long-range transport thus requiring continuous monitoring. Therefore, this research was carried out to investigate spatial and temporal trends of seven indicator PCBs and two others (PCB 105 and PCB 156) in the Nairobi River. Levels of PCBs ranged from below detection limit (bdl) to 157.64 +/- 1.52 ng g(-1)and bdl to 718.78 +/- 1.71 ng L(-1)for sediment and water, respectively. PCBs 28, 138, and 153 were the most dominant contributing 33.4%, 17.9%, and 14.5% to the total PCBs in sediments and 54.6%, 19.3%, and 14.1% to the total PCBs in water. There was a general increase in sigma PCBs from 18.89 to 151.18 ng g(-1)for sediments and 275.52 to 429.84 ng L(-1)for water as the River flowed downstream. The dry season recorded the highest sigma PCB in sediments while the rainy season recorded the highest sigma PCBs in water, with levels exceeding the WHO water quality guidelines. Risk assessment revealed that populations living downstream are exposed to high levels of PCBs through the consumption of water. Levels of sigma PCBs downstream also exceeded the sediment quality guidelines meaning that aquatic organisms are threatened.

With rather limited precipitation and hardly any surface runoff, these lakes are fed mainly by groundwater. However, the source of the groundwater and the groundwater discharge rates to these lakes are poorly understood. Water level and temperature of four representative lakes in the southeastern BJD were monitored continuously between 2013 and 2017. Water surface evaporation and rainfall in this area were also measured. Combining these acquired data, groundwater discharge rates were estimated using water balance models. The results show that the four lakes have similar recharge and discharge patterns, but at different average net groundwater discharge rates ranging from 1.79 to 3.09 mm d(-1). The lake level variation mainly depends on groundwater discharge and lake surface evaporation. We found that diurnal lake level variation may be controlled by earth tide and atmospheric pressure change, and is five times greater than the evaporation. The desert precipitation and deep confined groundwater with high temperature were found also recharging the desert lakes. An Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was used to identify the lake level trend. All lake levels increased over the last four years, except one decreased in 2015 and 2016. The lake levels' increasing trend is synchronously similar with the precipitation in north China. This study analyzes annual and seasonal lake level variations, and also finds the diurnal water cycle between the groundwater and lake water for the first time.

Its abundance and biomass are very dynamic in various habitats and subject to various factors, for example, nutrient and light. Following flooding events, the transitional area adjacent to a river inlet and the shallow lake generates diverse habitats for periphyton with gradients in current velocity, suspended matters, nutrients, and light, which would strongly shape the growth and community of periphyton. In this study, three sampling sites were established around a river inlet in Erhai Lake, China, and a field survey was conducted in the sites from April to August (flooding seasons) in 2019 to investigate the abundance and biomass of periphyton and explore influential factors. The results showed that three study areas have different gradients of current velocity depending on the distance to the river inlet, thereby regulating the concentrations of nutrients and suspended matters, which strongly affected the periphyton community; to be specific, the biomass of periphyton was inhibited by the concentration of suspended matters and high concentrations of silicate mainly reduced the diversity of periphyton. Our results imply that the study on the driving factors of periphyton could help to understand its community assembly mechanism and biomass and species composition of periphyton can provide some reference for trophic state of the lake.

One of the seasonal hypersaline lakes in the central desert zone is Aran-Bidgol Lake in which microbial diversity has not been characterized, thus the potential usage of this microbial community in biotechnology remained unknown. In this study, screening the halophilic hydrolytic enzyme-producing bacteria from different areas of this lake led to isolation of 61 gram-positive and 22 gram-negative moderately halophilic bacteria. These bacterial isolates were shown to produce a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes including DNase, inulinase, amylase, lipase, pectinase, protease, chitinase, pullulanase, cellulase, and xylanase. The most common enzymes were DNase and inulinase in gram-positive bacteria, lipase in gram-negative bacteria, and pullulanase and cellulase in gram-positive cocci. Interestingly, combined hydrolytic activates were observed in some isolates. According to their phenotypic characteristics and comparative partial 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the moderately halophilic strains belonged to the genera Halobacillus, Thalassobacillus, Bacillus, Salinicoccus, Idiomarina, Salicola, and Halomonas.					; babavalian, Hamid/V-5359-2019; Amoozegar, Mohammad/S-2220-2017; Pourbabaee, Ahmad/MZQ-3301-2025; Moosazadeh Moghaddam, Mehrdad/AAL-5848-2020	pourbabaei, Ahmad Ali/0000-0002-5273-2161; Amoozegar, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-9638-0532; Moosazadeh Moghaddam, Mehrdad/0000-0002-4645-8661													0026-2617	1608-3237				JUL	2013	82	4					466	474		10.1134/S0026261713040176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0026261713040176													WOS:000322903300012

In this study, undisturbed, forest soils within six randomly selected 0.5 m(2) exclosure plots (covered by netting of 2.3 mm(2) mesh size) were monitored from March to October 2003 for E. coli in order to describe its numerical and population characteristics. Culturable E. coli occurred in 88% of the samples collected, with overall mean counts of 16 MPN g(-1), ranging from < 1 to 1657 (n = 66). Escherichia coli counts did not correlate with substrate moisture content, air, or soil temperatures, suggesting that seasonality were not a strong factor in population density control. Mean E. coli counts in soil samples (n = 60) were significantly higher inside than immediately outside the exclosures; E. coli distribution within the exclosures was patchy. Repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (Rep-PCR) demonstrated genetic heterogeneity of E. coli within and among exclosure sites, and the soil strains were genetically distinct from animal (E. coli) strains tested (i.e. gulls, terns, deer and most geese). These results suggest that E. coli can occur and persist for extended periods in undisturbed temperate forest soils independent of recent allochthonous input and season, and that the soil E. coli populations formed a cohesive phylogenetic group in comparison to the set of fecal strains with which they were compared. Thus, in assessing E. coli sources within a stream, it is important to differentiate background soil loadings from inputs derived from animal and human fecal contamination.					; Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016; Ishii, Satoshi/C-7000-2012	Byappanahalli, Muruleedhara/0000-0001-5376-597X; Shively, Dawn/0000-0002-6119-924X; Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2006	8	3					504	513		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00916.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2005.00916.x								16478456					WOS:000235330900013

We analyze bacterial community composition and community-level physiological profiles in mountain lakes located in an altitude gradient in North Patagonian Andes below and above the timberline, together with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characterization and consumption. Our results indicated a decrease in 71 % of DOC and 65 % in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration as well as in bacteria abundances along the altitude range (1,380 to 1,950 m a.s.l.). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence analysis revealed a low global variability composed by two humic-like components (allochthonous substances) and a single protein-like component (autochthonous substances). Lakes below the timberline showed the presence of all the three components, while lakes above the timberline the protein-like compound constituted the main DOC component. Furthermore, bacterial community composition similarity and ordination analysis showed that altitude and resource concentration (DOC and TDP) were the main variables determining the ordination of groups. Community-level physiological profiles showed a mismatch with bacteria community composition (BCC), indicating the absence of a relationship between genetic and functional diversity in the altitude gradient. However, carbon utilization efficiencies varied according to the presence of different compounds in DOM bulk. The obtained results suggest that the different bacterial communities in these mountain lakes seem to have similar metabolic pathways in order to be able to exploit the available DOC molecules.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Bastidas Navarro, Marcela/0000-0002-6558-0451													0095-3628	1432-184X				OCT	2014	68	3					528	541		10.1007/s00248-014-0439-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0439-9								24863131					WOS:000342204100010

This study is about using a remote sensing approach to monitor long-term chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and the trophic state index (TSI) in ?ake Burdur, Turkiye. Surface reflectances from ?andsat 5, ?andsat 7, and ?andsat 8 satellite image collections were evaluated with an empirical equation to estimate a 38-year-long (1984-2021) time series of the lake's median Chl-a concentrations. Pixel quality masking is applied to retain only acceptable quality information and exclude images affected by cloud cover, icing, and other environmental factors from the analysis. The results were analyzed based on annual, seasonal, and monthly temporal averages. Over a period of 38 years, Chl-a concentrations were found to vary between 58.7 and 196.4 mg/m(3). Notably higher concentrations were recorded in 2010 and 2021, while lower concentrations were observed between 1991 and 1993. A substantial increase in Chl-a concentration was evident from 2002 to 2010. The maximum concentration of Chl-a during the first two decades of the analysis was 130 mg/m(3), which increased to 200 mg/m3 during the last two decades. ?andsatderived TSI values suggested that ?ake Burdur has been mostly hypertrophic for the entire study period.					; TUNA TUYGUN, GIZEM/AAR-7635-2020; Elçi, Alper/B-6664-2009; Tuygun, Gizem/AAR-7635-2020	Elci, Alper/0000-0002-8102-0438; TUNA TUYGUN, GIZEM/0000-0003-3001-1360; 													0273-1223	1996-9732				MAY 1	2023	87	9					2184	2194		10.2166/wst.2023.113	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2023.113		APR 2023						37186623					WOS:000971134200001

Although a wealth of literature exists on wetland functions, the seasonal behaviour of the papyrus mat and function in water storage has received less attention. The objective of this study was to assess the response of the papyrus root mat to changing water levels in a tropical wetland system in Eastern Uganda. We delineated seven transects through a section of a wetland system and mapped wetland bathymetry along these transects. We used three transects to measure spatial and temporal changes in mat thickness and free water column, and to monitor variations in total depth during two seasons. The free water column increased across all transects in the wet season. However, changes in the mat thickness varied spatially and were influenced by the rate of increase of the free water column as well as wetland bathymetry. The proportion of mat compression was higher at the shallow end of the wetland (83%) compared to the deep end (67%). There was a significant negative correlation between changes in free water column and papyrus mat thickness (r = -0.85, p = 000). Therefore, the mat compresses in response to increase in free water column, which increases the ratio of the free water column to root mat thickness. Hence, the wetland accommodates excess water during rainy seasons. Water depth varied from 1.5 m to 2.1 m during the monitoring period, corresponding to a water storage of 61,597 m(3) and 123,355 m(3) respectively. This means a 50% change in water volume for the studied wetland section. This water regulatory function mitigates severity of floods downstream, but the stored water is also useful to the surrounding communities for wetland-edge farm irrigation during dry seasons.

J	Mukhopadhyay, P; Valsalan, SA				Mukhopadhyay, Patralika; Valsalan, Shibu Arkkakadavil			Seasonal variation, spatial distribution and risk assessment of microplastics in surface waters of Periyar River, Kerala, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Microplastics, an emerging contaminant, are widespread in oceans around the world, and rivers are the key conveyors of these pollutants into the oceans. There exists a dearth of available data pertaining to seasonal fluctuation, spatial distribution and risk assessment of microplastics in rivers extending from upper reaches to the lower reaches. The collection of such data is of utmost importance for the purpose of formulating beneficial management strategies for riverine microplastics. In order to bridge this research gap, an investigation was made in the Periyar River in Kerala, India, which is exposed to anthropogenic stress and is at risk of microplastic pollution. A total of eighteen sites (six sites each from downstream, midstream and upstream) along the 244 km of the river were investigated across three seasons in a year. The study revealed a discernible pattern in the spatial distribution of microplastic concentrations, wherein there was a rise in abundance from the upstream to midstream and then a sudden increase of abundance along the downstream regions towards the lower reaches. The highest mean microplastic abundance of 124.95 items/L was obtained during the monsoon season followed by post-monsoon season i.e. 123.21 items/L and pre-monsoon i.e. 120.50 items/L. The predominant forms of microplastics were found to be fibres, fragments and filaments. Most prevalent polymer types acquired were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Pollution hazard index (PHI) and pollution load index (PLI) were also evaluated to assess the water quality of this river. The findings of this study conclude that the Periyar River is polluted with microplastics throughout its course and offer significant insights into the detection of microplastic origins in river systems and lend support to the implementation of potential measures aimed at mitigating their impact.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2024	196	7							679	10.1007/s10661-024-12820-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-12820-x								38951273					WOS:001266337100004

We collected stream and groundwater samples for Hg and organic carbon analyses across the upper Hudson River, a 493 km(2) basin in the central Adirondacks to evaluate and model the sources of variation in filtered total Hg (FTHg) concentrations. Variability in FTHg concentrations during the growing seasons (May-Oct) of 2007-2009 in Fishing Brook, a 66-km(2) sub-basin, was better explained by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), a measure of organic carbon aromaticity, than by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, a commonly used Hg indicator. SUVA(254) was a stronger predictor of FTHg concentrations during the growing season than during the dormant season. Multiple linear regression models that included SUVA(254) values and DOC concentrations could explain 75 % of the variation in FTHg concentrations on an annual basis and 84 % during the growing season. A multiple linear regression landscape modeling approach applied to 27 synoptic sites across the upper Hudson basin found that higher SUVA(254) values are associated with gentler slopes, and greater riparian area, and lower SUVA(254) values are associated with an increasing influence of open water. We hypothesize that the strong Hg-SUVA(254) relation in this basin reflects distinct patterns of FTHg and SUVA(254) that are characteristic of source areas that control the mobilization of Hg to surface waters, and that the seasonal influence of these source areas varies in this heterogeneous basin landscape.					; Burns, Douglas/A-7507-2009; Bradley, Paul/AAC-2451-2020; Schelker, Jakob/H-3734-2018	Bradley, Paul/0000-0001-7522-8606; Journey, Celeste/0000-0002-2284-5851; Burns, Douglas/0000-0001-6516-2869; Schelker, Jakob/0000-0002-0274-7605													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAY	2013	113	1-3					451	466		10.1007/s10533-012-9773-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-012-9773-5													WOS:000317863300028

The temporal and spatial variations of the hydrodynamics are assessed using a validated three dimensional hydrodynamic finite element model. The developed methodology was applied to the Cape Peloro system, a coastal protected area located in the Messina Strait (Italy) consisting of two connected small brackish basins: the shallow Lake Ganzirri and the deep meromictic Lake Faro. The hydrodynamics of the two coastal lakes shows strong seasonal and spatial variation. The 3-D distribution of the water renewal times suggests a horizontal partition of the Lake Ganzirri into two sub-basins and a vertical zonation of the Lake Faro, with the mixolimnion extending till 10 m depth and the presence of a persistent bottom stagnant layer. The derived physically-based zonation scheme helps in explaining the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of many biogeochemical variables in the Cape Peloro coastal system.

Biogeochemistry of "pristine" freshwater stream and lake systems in the western Canadian Arctic	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Climate change poses a substantial threat to the stability of the Arctic terrestrial carbon (C) pool as warmer air temperatures thaw permafrost and deepen the seasonally-thawed active layer of soils and sediments. Enhanced water flow through this layer may accelerate the transport of C and major cations and anions to streams and lakes. These act as important conduits and reactors for dissolved C within the terrestrial C cycle. It is important for studies to consider these processes in small headwater catchments, which have been identified as hotspots of rapid mineralisation of C sourced from ancient permafrost thaw. In order to better understand the role of inland waters in terrestrial C cycling we characterised the biogeochemistry of the freshwater systems in a c. 14 km(2) study area in the western Canadian Arctic. Sampling took place during the snow-free seasons of 2013 and 2014 for major inorganic solutes, dissolved organic and inorganic C (DOC and DIC, respectively), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations from three water type groups: lakes, polygonal pools and streams. These groups displayed differing biogeochemical signatures, indicative of contrasting biogeochemical controls. However, none of the groups showed strong signals of enhanced permafrost thaw during the study seasons. The mean annual air temperature in the region has increased by more than 2.5 A degrees C since 1970, and continued warming will likely affect the aquatic biogeochemistry. This study provides important baseline data for comparison with future studies in a warming Arctic.					; Tetzlaff, Doerthe/D-1818-2018; Subke, Jens-Arne/M-3049-2013; Billett, Michael/D-7710-2012; Wookey, Philip/AAA-6271-2020; Dean, Joshua/P-9009-2017; Dinsmore, Kerry/A-1949-2010; Baxter, Robert/C-7688-2012	Wookey, Philip/0000-0001-5957-6424; Tetzlaff, Doerthe/0000-0002-7183-8674; Subke, Jens-Arne/0000-0001-9244-639X; Dean, Joshua/0000-0001-9058-7076; Dinsmore, Kerry/0000-0002-3586-6256; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2016	130	3					191	213		10.1007/s10533-016-0252-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0252-2								32355382					WOS:000390021800001

The reservoir is characterized by two major flow regimes: a wet fill hydrologic regime and a dry spill one. A seasonal sampling campaign was carried out over a period of 2 years (20112013) where water samples were collected across the water column and from piezometers just outside the perimeter of the reservoir. Similarly, sediments were collected from the corresponding areas beneath the water column. The water samples were analyzed for environmental isotopic ratios, elemental composition, and physical, biological and chemical parameters, whereas the sediment and algal samples were subjected to physical, mineralogical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses. This investigation indicated that the dam had resulted in the alteration of the biogeochemical cycle of nutrients as well as the degradation of the sediment and water quality. The hydrological and biogeochemical processes were found to induce vertical downward transport of chemicals towards the fine grained calcareous sediments during the fill mode, whereas the sediments acted as a source of a chemical flux upward through the water column and downward towards the groundwater during the spill mode. The geomorphological characteristics of the reservoir enhanced the strong hydrological connectivity between the surface water and the groundwater where the reservoir responded quickly to natural and anthropogenic changes in the upper watershed. The water and sediments in the sensitive spill mode were of poor quality and should receive more attention due to the potential hazard for the associated hydro-project and the sustainability of the agricultural soil in the long term. Thus, a safe water and sediment management plan should be implemented in order to improve the dam functionality and to safeguard the precious water resources.

While most published research has studied pure cultures, the consortia of algae and bacteria from wastewater have more complex community dynamics which affect both the biomass production and pollutant removal. In this paper we investigate the dynamics of algal and bacterial growth in wastewater treating batch photo-bioreactors. The photo-bioreactors were inoculated with water from a nearby lake. Lake water was obtained in August, November and December in order to add native algal species and study the effects of the season. The photo-bioreactors inoculated with lake water obtained in August and November produced more biomass and grew faster than those that only contained the algae from wastewater. The results indicated a rapid decline in bacterial abundance before algae began to multiply in reactors supplemented with lake water in November and December. The reactors were also successful in removing nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the influence factors and the indication significance for eutrophication are also discussed. The results are as follows: (1) The DOC content of Erhai Lake sediments ranges from 0.17 to 0.77 g kg(-1), which is higher in dry season than that in wet season. Its DOC content of the sediment from the northern part is higher than that from the southern, and that is the smallest in the central. Moreover, DOM in Erhai Lake sediments comprise of protein- and humic-like substances. The average contents of protein-, fulvic acid-like substances and soluble microbial byproduct-like materials in the wet season are higher than those in the dry season by 25.92, 11.82 and 2.96 %, respectively; while the content of humic-like substance in the wet season is lower than that in the dry season by 6.94 %. As to the spatial distribution, the contents of protein- and fulvic acid-like substances are the highest in the central of Erhai Lake sediments, and that of the humic-like substance is the highest in the southern part. In addition, the humification degree of DOM in the dry season is higher than that in the wet season. (2) The DOM in Erhai Lake sediments mainly originated from terrestrial sources, of which the terrestrial pollutant has a main impact in the dry season, and the terrestrial pollutant input and biogenetic derivation play an equally important part in the wet season. Terrestrial pollutant and aquatic plants are the important factors that influence the DOM composition of Erhai Lake sediments. (3) The characteristic parameter (P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n)) (the content ratio of humic-like substance to protein-like substances) of the DOM composition of Erhai Lake sediments is positively correlated with the contents of the different nitrogen (N) forms in the sediments (R (2) = 0.68-0.83, P < 0.01). The contents of N forms in sediments and its source characteristic can be reflected by the P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n) value. So the P-(III+V,P-n)/P-(I+II,P-n) value can be taken as the indirect indicator of the contents of N forms in sediments. Moreover, the composition characteristic of DOM in sediments can reflect the contents of N forms to some extent, that is, the risk of N release from Erhai Lake sediments can be indicated to some extent.

The abundance of picophytoplankton in these waters can be up to several orders of magnitude higher than that in freshwater shallow lakes, but differences are also found within different saline water types: higher picophytoplankton abundances were observed in hypersaline lakes compared to humic soda lakes, and their highest numbers were detected in turbid soda lakes. Moreover, their contribution to phytoplankton biomass is higher than that in shallow freshwater lakes with similar trophic states. Based on long-term data, their ratio within the phytoplankton increased with turbidity in the case of turbid soda lakes, while, in hypersaline lakes, their proportion increased with salinity. Picocyanobacteria were only detected with high abundance (>10(6)-10(7) cells/mL) in turbid soda lakes, while picoeukaryotes occurred in high numbers in both turbid and hypersaline lakes. Despite the extreme conditions of the lakes, the diversity of picophytoplankton is remarkable, with the dominance of non-marine Synechococcus/Cyanobium, Choricystis, Chloroparva and uncultured trebouxiophycean green algae in the soda lakes, and marine Synechococcus and Picochlorum in the hypersaline lakes.					; Boros, Emil/AAQ-8870-2020; Felfoldi, Tamas/F-7856-2011	Felfoldi, Tamas/0000-0003-2009-2478; Somogyi, Boglarka/0000-0003-0900-3315; Boros, Emil/0000-0001-6226-1757; 														2076-2607				APR	2022	10	4							818	10.3390/microorganisms10040818	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10040818								35456867					WOS:000786932200001

The data were obtained in different seasons covering the period 2019-2021. The concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions, the content of organic matter (TOC, CODMn, CODCr, water color, BOD5), nutrients (PO4-P, TP, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, TN), Fe, Mn, heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cd, Pb), total suspended solids (TSS), conductivity, and pH of water were measured. The analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry, ICP-MS, spectrophotometric, spectrometric, gravimetric, flamephotometric, titrimetric methods, potentiometric, and conductometric determination. The data are useful for comparative analysis of the hydrochemical characteristics of Lake Onego and other large lakes, and they also allow to assess the water quality of the lake as a whole and in its particular individual areas.

Effects of freshwater input on nutrient loading, phytoplankton biomass, and cyanotoxin production in an oligohaline estuarine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Pulsed river water events can increase nutrient levels potentially translating into enhanced primary production, phytoplankton community shifts, and bloom formation. The Bonnet Carr, Spillway is a managed river diversion which can be used to redirect a significant amount of Mississippi River water into Lake Pontchartrain, reducing the risks of flood in the downstream communities during runoff seasons. We investigated nutrient enrichment and consequent changes in phytoplankton biomass, including toxic species in Lake Pontchartrain during and after a 1-month Bonne Carr, Spillway opening in 2008. Water samples were collected along a 30 km transect. A freshwater plume was found to have formed by the strong river input that had limited mixing with the lake during the opening. The plume and lake water gradually mixed together after the Spillway was closed, indicated by the reduction of the horizontal salinity gradient. The river pulse increased the lake nitrate and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations to more than five times the lake background in the plume stations. Nutrient concentrations decreased rapidly after the Spillway closure as the plume dissipated. Diatoms and chlorophytes dominated the system during the opening. After the Spillway closure, there was a shift over time from diatom dominance to toxic cyanobacteria dominance that corresponded to more stable, warmer, and nutrient-limited water conditions. Associated toxins were present and varied over time and space. Further research on the phytoplankton assemblages on the lake is needed in subsequent, non-Spillway opening years to evaluate the impact of river water pulses on the development of these toxic cyanobacterial blooms.					; White, John R./A-7940-2008; Fulweiler, Robinson/A-3806-2010; White, John/A-7940-2008; Li, Chunyan/ABB-2765-2020	Riekenberg, Jessica/0000-0002-6201-7460; White, John R./0000-0002-9967-013X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	661	1					377	389		10.1007/s10750-010-0545-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0545-8													WOS:000285064900030

Abiotic variables included eleven water quality parameters, and were characterized by water quality index (WQI). Biotic variables included periphyton function and diversity metrics. WQI differed in different seasons at sampling sites and the highest value of WQI was observed in October 2009. Periphyton function metrics, expressed by extracellular enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and leucine aminopeptidase, gross primary productivity and daily respiration rate, and diversity indices, in terms of Shannon diversity index and Berger-Parker abundance index, showed significantly temporal and spatial variations. Regression linear analysis illustrated a fairly good correlation of WQI with periphyton function and diversity indices, Shannon diversity index was the best correlated with WQI (r = 0.904, P < 0.01), followed by leucine aminopeptidase (r = -0.847, P < 0.01) and Berger-Parker abundance index (r = -0.840, P < 0.01), alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase and gross primary productivity also showed a good inverse correlation with WQI. Redundancy analysis suggested that eleven environmental variables explained a significant amount of the variation in the periphyton community data. The study was helpful for us to understand chemical and ecological status of water quality, and give us messages for monitoring water quality accurately.

J	Lindberg, KR; Daniels, WC; Castañeda, IS; Brigham-Grette, J				Lindberg, Kurt R.; Daniels, William C.; Castaneda, Isla S.; Brigham-Grette, Julie			Biomarker proxy records of Arctic climate change during the Mid-Pleistocene transition from Lake El'gygytgyn (Far East Russia)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) is a widely recognized global climate shift occurring between approximately 1250 and 700 ka. At this time, Earth's climate underwent a major transition from dominant 40 kyr glacial-interglacial cycles to quasi-100 kyr cycles. The cause of the MPT remains a puzzling aspect of Pleistocene climate. Presently, there are few, if any, continuous MPT records from the Arctic, yet understanding the role and response of the high latitudes to the MPT is required to better evaluate the causes of this climatic shift. Here, we present new continental biomarker records of temperature and vegetation spanning 1142 to 752 ka from Lake El'gygytgyn (Far East Russia). We reconstruct warm-season temperature variations across the MPT based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). The new Arctic temperature record does not display an overall cooling trend during the MPT but does exhibit strong glacial-interglacial cyclicity. Spectral analysis demonstrates persistent obliquity and precession pacing over the study interval and reveals substantial sub-orbital temperature variations at similar to 900 ka during the first "skipped" interglacial. Interestingly, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 31, which is widely recognized as a particularly warm interglacial, does not exhibit exceptional warmth in the Lake El'gygytgyn brGDGT record. Instead, we find that MIS 29, 27, and 21 were as warm or warmer than MIS 31. In particular, MIS 21 (similar to 870 to 820 ka) stands out as an especially warm and long interglacial in the continental Arctic while MIS 25 is a notably cold interglacial. Throughout the MPT, Lake El'gygytgyn pollen data exhibit a long-term drying trend, with a shift to an increasingly open landscape noted after around 900 ka (Zhao et al., 2018), which is also reflected in our higher plant leaf wax (n-alkane) distributions. Although the mechanisms driving the MPT remain a matter of debate, our new climate records from the continental Arctic exhibit some similarities to changes noted around the North Pacific region. Overall, the new organic geochemical data from Lake El'gygytgyn contribute to expanding our knowledge of the high-latitude response to the MPT.

Small catchments <= 10 km(2) are not monitored under the Water Framework Directive but play an important role in freshwater ecosystems. The high complexity in seasonal and spatial dynamics require more than a one-size-fits-all approach in water quality monitoring. Often located in rural areas with a high agricultural activity, small catchments often carry high amounts of nutrients, pesticides and their transformation products affecting drinking water resources. With a low-cost approach of a monthly sampling campaign over the course of one year combined with meaningful indicators for potential pollution sources within the catchment this study could elucidate catchment dynamics and two hotspots for pesticides and nutrients. Two different groups of pesticides were observed (I) pesticides on long-term use which were applied in high amounts over the last decades (e.g., chloridazon and its transformation products) and (II) pesticides on short-term use, newly introduced into the market. Especially transformation products of pesticides from group (I) together with nitrate showed a steady release from two fields into the receiving water bodies over the year, probably being stored in the soil layers over the years of application slowly leaching out. Pesticides from group (II) showed a strong seasonality, released from another hotspot area probably due to run-off shortly after application. Streamlining this knowledge into targeted measures and an agile monitoring strategy for the respective catchments may allow a sustainable improvement of water quality and a better ecosystem protection.

Discrimination of hydrologic variations for spatial distribution of fish assemblage in a large subtropical temperate river	ECOHYDROLOGY												This study examines the effects of the flow and flood pulses on spatial dispersion of fish assemblages in the floodplain of the Parana River in Argentina. We tested the hypothesis that high water levels and greater lateral connectivity promote fish dispersal and spatial homogenization of assemblage structure. We sampled four sites during different phases of the annual hydrologic cycle from 2010 to 2016. Water surface in the area was estimated during each phase. We computed multivariate statistics and estimates of ss-diversity to analyse assemblage variations in relation to hydrological phases. Three hydrological phases were defined: low flow pulses (water levels between 2.3 and 3.2, approximately 10% of the floodplain covered by water), high flow pulses (between 3.2 and 4.5, from 11 to 84%), and floods (> 4.5 m, more than 84%). Although difference between high flow pulses and flood was not significant, ss-diversity values for these stages were higher than for low flow pulses. This suggests that floods and high flow pulses increase the spatial variability of fish assemblages, whereas homogenization processes occur later during low flow periods. This work provides further knowledge about the flood homogenization effect in a large unregulated floodplain where lateral connectivity still plays a significant role on ecological structuring processes.					; Blettler, Martin/K-3795-2017; Simoes, Nadson Ressye/J-9701-2012; Simões, Nadson/J-9701-2012	Rabuffetti, Ana Pia/0000-0003-0106-0876; Blettler, Martin/0000-0001-5837-5241; Espinola, Luis/0000-0003-2479-3079; Paira, Aldo Raul/0000-0002-9948-6711; Abrial, Elie/0000-0003-4563-5512; Simoes, Nadson Ressye/0000-0002-4577-9033; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				MAR	2020	13	2							e2163	10.1002/eco.2163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2163		DEC 2019											WOS:000503735800001

The effect of increasing temperature and pCO2 on experimental pelagic freshwater communities	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												As the global climate is changing, average water temperatures and the supply of CO2 to water bodies are increasing. To determine how the effects of these changes on freshwater communities interact, we ran a month-long factorial mesocosm experiment, in which we manipulated water temperature (heated, ambient) and pCO(2) (preindustrial, ambient, future). We found that the total phytoplankton biomass responded positively to the pCO(2) and temperature treatments but no interactive effects were detected. Green algae were positively affected by temperature and, over the course of the experiment, responded to pCO(2) first positively, then negatively. Heterokonts, on the other hand, were unaffected by temperature but responded positively to pCO(2). pCO(2) enrichment also led to increases in seston C : N stoichiometry, although the experiment ended before we could observe any effects of pCO(2) on the zooplankton community composition. Warming caused shifts in zooplankton community composition, primarily through higher abundances of the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris and the rotifer Conochilus unicornis, and lower abundances of the rotifer Polyarthra vulgaris. We found that, in contrast to the effects of temperature, which can be explained by temperature-dependent plankton growth curves, the responses of algal groups to pCO(2) enrichment were difficult to anticipate, despite the availability of priors from previous pCO(2) enrichment experiments in the same lake mesocosms. We conclude that climate change-induced increases in aquatic pCO(2) and temperatures are likely to affect pelagic ecosystems, though further research in freshwater systems is needed before generalized claims regarding the simple and interactive effects of pCO(2) can be made.

J	Grabas, GP; Rokitnicki-Wojcik, D				Grabas, Greg P.; Rokitnicki-Wojcik, Daniel			Characterizing daily water-level fluctuation intensity and water quality relationships with plant communities in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Seasonal and multi-year water-level fluctuations in the Laurentian Great Lakes maintain wetland vegetation diversity and wildlife habitat value, but little is known about the relationship between daily water-level fluctuations (wind tides and seiches) and plant community attributes. We used portable water-level loggers to determine mean daily fluctuation intensity (Fl) at different timescales in selected Lake Ontario wetlands of various hydrogeomorphic types. Among years, Fl varied across sites but was more consistent within sites and was significantly higher in open embayments than in drowned rivermouths or protected embayments. Of the time-scales considered (15, 30, 60, and 120 min), 15-minute intervals gave the best resolution in H among wetlands. We examined associations between Fl and vegetation coverage of seven guilds: submerged and rooted floating-leaved vegetation (SAV), free-floating, non-persistent emergent (NPE), Typha spp., meadow marsh (MM), shrub, and upland at 20-cm elevation increments along transects from approximately 0.8 m deep to 1.2 m upland while accounting for poor water quality, which is known to decrease vegetation coverage. Wetlands with higher conductivity had less SAV, free-floating, and NPE coverage, while wetlands with high turbidity had marginally less SAV and Typha spp., but more free-floating coverage. Wetlands with higher Hs had more NPE vegetation in shallow depths and more MM but less shrub and upland coverage at elevations above the long-term average water level, suggesting that Fl is a hydrologic factor in vegetation establishment. These results can be used for modeling Lake Ontario plant communities and support adaptive management monitoring following a water-level regulation change.

The salinity of this terminal lake is of great ecological consequence for the existence and growth of ArtemiaUrmiana, a unique zooplankton endemic to the lake. It is a main food source for large bird populations. During the past decades, Lake Urmia has been strained by a number of anthropogenic and natural causes. They include extensive damming on the contributory rivers, building a dike-type causeway and climate change. This paper deals with the long-term impacts of damming, fresh water overexploitation and water level manipulation on flow and salinity conditions in Lake Urmia. For this purpose, the flow and salinity regimes were numerically simulated for the next four decades. The validity of the pseudo-three-dimensional hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion models was assessed through sensitivity analysis of the models and comparing the simulated results against field measurements. The model predicted that because of damming on the rivers, the mean water level in the lake will possibly experience a drop of 2.2-2.8m over next 40 years. The results indicated that, over decadal time periods, the lake most probably will be split into two interconnected smaller lakes. The northern lake was foreseen to become extremely saline, which will seriously threaten the Artemia's survival in this area. Over the long-term periods, the southern lake seemed not to deviate much from its existing conditions. It however appeared to become more responsive to seasonal climatic changes and to the rivers inflow, as compared with its current conditions. Effects from climate changes were not considered in the current study.

Retention and transport of nutrients in a mature agricultural impoundment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Small impoundments intended for irrigation, livestock watering, and hydropower are numerous in agricultural regions of the world. Many of these artificial water bodies are well positioned to intercept fertilizer runoff and pollutants but could be vulnerable to long-term sedimentation, management intervention, or failure. We examined solute retention in a mature, sediment-filled, run-of-river impoundment created by a small, >100 year old dam in agricultural Wisconsin, United States. To do so, we measured instantaneous net fluxes of inorganic and organic solutes through the system, which contained wetlands. The impoundment was a persistent net sink for sulfate and, during the warm season only, a net sink for nitrate, ammonium, and soluble reactive phosphorus. There was also a negative relationship between nitrate and sulfate retention, suggestive of nitrate-stimulated sulfate production. Impoundment hydraulics were then altered by a management manipulation (dam removal) that caused mean water travel time to decrease by approximately 40%. Following manipulation, autoregressive modeling of solute time series indicated a decrease in mean net retention of nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, and soluble reactive phosphorus. There was also a decrease in the variability (coefficient of variation) of instantaneous net exports of dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus. These biogeochemical changes were consistent with predictions based on hydraulics (reduced water travel time), with the exception of ammonium release immediately following reservoir dewatering. Our results emphasize the biogeochemical importance of reservoir-wetland ecosystems, which are expanding with impoundment sedimentation but are threatened by infrastructure aging. We suggest that reservoir wetlands be considered in the management of dams and surface water pollution. Citation: Powers, S. M., J. Julian, M. Doyle, and E. H.

What is important in this research is to characterize the distribution of noise sources both over frequency and in energy content. The present review considers the main mechanisms for the generation of microseisms, including primary and secondary microseisms (0.05-0.3 Hz), low frequency oscillations (0.2-50 mHz), high frequency oscillations (2-60 Hz), and lake-generated microseisms (0.5-2 Hz). We also describe the most popular procedures in use for the processing and analysis of continuous seismic ambient noise arrivals; we demonstrate a wide range of geophysical problems based on recordings of microseismic ground motion.

As a consequence of extremely high floods, the whole floodplain area (approximately 16 km(2)) became one lentic habitat with well developed macrophyte vegetation. Seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the lake had a characteristic pattern for the shallow lakes with dense macrophyte vegetation. Extremely low mean phytoplankton abundance and biomass were found in the conditions of very high nutrient concentrations. Dominant phytoplankton species were diatoms and chlorococcal green algae from the functional groups characteristic for a mixed environment. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that nutrients and temperature were significant environmental variables for their development. The sequence of phytoplankton seasonality, vertical distribution of phytoplankton, as well as the domination of rapidly acclimating phytoplankton forms (R-strategists) indicated clear, well-mixed conditions and a highly disturbed environment. Our results suggest that the occurrence of extreme flooding can be a stressor high enough for the transition from a turbid to a clear state of the floodplain lake. Possibly, cyclic shifts between alternative stable states in floodplain ecosystems can be expected as a consequence of the impact of extreme hydrological events induced by a climate change.

Impacts of management and enclosure age on recovery of the herbaceous rangeland vegetation in semi-arid Kenya	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Establishment of seasonal grazing enclosures has become an important rangeland rehabilitation strategy in semi-arid regions. This study assessed the impact of enclosure age and enclosure management on the vegetation composition in the Njemps Flats range unit, Lake Baringo Basin (Kenya). Six communal enclosures (13-23 years since establishment) and six private enclosures (3-17 years since establishment) were selected. Point-line transect and quadrat-based measurements were made of herbaceous cover, functional group relative abundance and standing crop inside the enclosures and in the adjacent open rangeland. Unpalatable forbs and sedges dominated the herbaceous vegetation of the degraded open rangeland. Informal semi-private land ownership reduced open rangeland degradation as shown by a higher cover of surviving annual grasses. Rangeland enclosure fostered regeneration of annual and perennial grasses, and significantly increased grass cover and standing crop. Private and communal enclosure management were equally successful in rehabilitating grass cover. Standing crop in the communal enclosures was fully recovered, but it was sub-optimal in all private enclosures reflecting recent grazing or grass cutting activities. The variability in rehabilitation success highlights the high potential of individual herders' incentives to promote rangeland rehabilitation but also stresses the importance of more detailed characterisation and monitoring of the enclosure management decisions.

Salinity is a strong selective force for many aquatic organisms, affecting both ecological and evolutionary processes. Most of our knowledge on the effects of salinity on rotifers in the Brachionus plicatilis species complex is based mainly on populations from waterbodies that experience broad environmental changes both seasonally and annually. We tested the hypothesis that, despite the supposedly high potential for gene flow among rotifers inhabiting neighbouring environments, constant salinity has promoted local adaptation, genetic population divergence and even cryptic speciation in B. plicatilis complex populations from three deep maar lakes of distinct salinities [1.1, 6.5 and 9.0 g L-1 total dissolved solids (TDS)] in Central Mexico. 2. To look for local adaptation, we performed common garden experiments to test the effect of different salinities on population density and intrinsic growth rate (r). Then, we evaluated the genetic divergence by sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and performed reproductive trials to assess the potential gene flow among the three populations and with other closely related B. plicatilis complex species. 3. We confirmed that the rotifer populations have phenotypic plasticity in tolerance of salinity, but only rotifers from the least saline lake are adapted to low salinity. Among the populations, sequence divergence at COI was very low (just a single haplotype was found), suggesting a persistent founder effect from a relatively recent single colonisation event and a subsequent dispersal from one lake to the others, and a very restricted immigration rate. In the phylogenetic analysis, rotifers from this area of Mexico clustered in the same clade with the middle-sized species Brachionus ibericus and B. sp. 'Almenara'. Mexican rotifers showed successful recognition, copulation and formation of hybrids among them, but interpopulation breeding with the Spanish B. ibericus and B. sp. 'Almenara' was unsuccessful. 4. We conclude that the B. plicatilis complex populations from these three lakes belong to a new biological species not yet described (presently named B. sp. 'Mexico'). To our knowledge, this is the first report of local adaptation of a natural B. plicatilis complex population living in freshwater conditions (1.1 g L-1 TDS).

Diatoms in short sediment cores from three bays in northern Taihu Lake were studied in addition to 1-year of seasonal phytoplankton samples in order to evaluate the rate and magnitude of nutrient enrichment. The dominant species found in the phytoplankton samples appeared in high percentages in the surface sediment samples, suggesting that the latter faithfully record the modern diatom flora. The diatom preservation status varied among the three cores, while in all cores the preservation deteriorated with sediment depth. Due to the superior diatom preservation in the core from Mashan Bay, the fossil diatom record of this core and an established diatom total phosphorus (TP) transfer function were used to reconstruct the nutrient history of Taihu Lake. Diatom assemblages changed from Aulacoseira-dominated to other eutrophic planktonic species, such as Stephanodiscus minutulus, Cyclostephanos tholiformis, Cyclotella atomus, C. meneghiniana and S. hantzschii in ca. 1980. Diatom-inferred TP concentrations exhibited little change prior to 1980, with values around 50 mu g/l. However, after 1980 TP concentrations increased significantly and remained in excess of 100 mu g/l, reflecting eutrophication of Taihu Lake. Comparison with TP measurements in the water column from 1988 to 2004, as well as the analogue analysis among fossil and modern samples, demonstrates that the diatom-TP inference model can reliably hindcast past TP concentrations. Therefore, the baseline TP value of about 50 mu g/l, can be used as a restoration target for Taihu Lake. However, due to the complexity of this very large, shallow aquatic ecosystem, caution should be exercised when employing the diatom record to track eutrophication. Further studies on the mechanism of diatom distribution, evolution and preservation are recommended for Taihu Lake.					; Yang, Handong/G-1104-2015; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019; Dong, Xuhui/B-5104-2011	Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2008	40	1					413	429		10.1007/s10933-007-9170-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9170-6													WOS:000257208600027
J	Cannon, DJ; Troy, CD				Cannon, David J.; Troy, Cary D.			Observations of turbulence and mean flow in the low-energy hypolimnetic boundary layer of a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Near-bed measurements are reported for both mean flow and turbulence structure in the deep hypolimnetic waters of Lake Michigan (55 m depth) during stratified and unstratified periods to determine validity and restrictions of the expected law-of-the-wall (LOW) behavior. Near-bed currents were weak (U-50 = 3, 16 cm s(-1) for mean, maximum currents respectively at 50 cm elevation), dominated by subinertial energy across all seasons, and showed little seasonal variation in spite of the strong seasonality to wind forcing. Velocity structure for wave-free conditions showed strong log-linear trends within 1 mab, with over 98% of the 2152 velocity profiles producing significant log-linear fits within the bottom meter and a strictly logarithmic velocity profile extending to only 66 cmab on average (C-d 50 = 0.0052; z(o) = 0.0015 m). Stratification was dynamically unimportant to mean flow and turbulence, but fitted log-linear length scales suggest that deviations from strictly logarithmic velocity structure may be explained by flow unsteadiness. Turbulent quantities measured within 1 m of the bed including dissipation, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent length scales followed LOW expectations in the mean, but individual estimates deviated by several orders of magnitude. The observed deviations from LOW turbulent structure were found to be correlated with the log-linear length scales fit to mean velocity profiles and were consistent with the effects of flow unsteadiness.

The water regime evolution refers to the spatial and temporal alterations in the hydrological features of lakes. Characterizing the lake water regime and its alteration may help policymakers design effective adaption strategies. Therefore, total 47 hydrological indicators were proposed, considering intra-annual fluctuations, flood and drought features, and rate and frequency of water level variations. Combined with Mann-Kendall algorithm and Sen's slope, the indicators were applied in Poyang Lake, a typically large seasonal lake in China, as a case study. The results revealed temporal and spatial variations in different hydrological indicators. The most dramatic alteration was the water level decline in October and November over the entire study phase, especially over the past 30 years. This was an urgent environmental problem that Poyang Lake faced, partially caused by the increased hydraulic gradient between southern and northern lake. It could trigger the drought occurring earlier, prolong the drought duration, and impair the wetland ecosystem. Environmental water requirements of both Poyang Lake and Yangtze River were suggested for regional sustainable development. The application in Poyang Lake showed the practicability and reliability of the indicators, which are applicable in international seasonal lakes. The series of indicators can be used in whole or in part, determined by the ecohydrological characters of a specific lake and the research objectives.

J	Brendonck, L; De Meester, L				Brendonck, L; De Meester, L			Egg banks in freshwater zooplankton: evolutionary and ecological archives in the sediment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many representatives of freshwater zooplankton produce at some stage in their life cycle resting stages. A variable portion of the eggs of the previous growing period will hatch at the next occasion while the remaining ones are added to a persistent egg bank, where they can remain viable for decades or longer. The importance of the study of resting eggs and egg banks in general for such different disciplines as taxonomy, ecological biogeography, paleolimnology, nature conservation, evolutionary ecology and community and population ecology is generally appreciated. The major current and expected future developments in this rapidly expanding field of research are presented here. The structure and dynamics of the egg bank are determined by the life history characteristics of the species (or local population), the hatching phenology of their resting stages, and the characteristics of the habitat. The horizontal distribution of dormant stages is generally patchy, with a greater density in the deeper and/or windward parts of a pond or lake. In sediment cores, most viable ( responsive) eggs occur in the upper centimeters, although vertical variation related to the history of fish predation or water quality occurs. The accumulation of resting stages of different species, generations and genotypes with variable regeneration niches results in a mixed egg bank with greater potential biodiversity than the active community sampled at any one moment. Through the benthic-pelagic coupling, this dormant reservoir may have considerable impact on the evolutionary potential of the organisms, the ecological dynamics of the community and the distribution of species. Egg banks can be considered the archive of the local habitat, since the pattern of changes in species assemblage and genotypes from the past up to the present reflect changes due to natural or anthropogenic impact that can be used to reconstruct evolutionary processes or even to restore the local habitat. Overlooking the egg bank as an important component of zooplankton communities may lead to erroneous interpretations in the analysis of community and population genetic structure. This review integrates technical and scientific information needed in the study of the structure and function of egg banks in zooplankton with special focus on the fascinating latest developments in the field.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2003	491	1-3					65	84		10.1023/A:1024454905119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024454905119													WOS:000183771600006
J	Wang, J; Li, MC; Liu, YJ; Zhang, JX; Zheng, X				Wang, Jing; Li, Mingcai; Liu, Yanju; Zhang, Jinxin; Zheng, Xiao			Large-scale climatic drivers for warm-season compound drought and heatwave frequency over North China	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Based on multiple observational and reanalysis datasets, this study investigated the large-scale climatic drivers responsible for the warm season (April to September) compound drought and heatwave (CDHW) frequency over the North China (NC) domain, both locally and remotely. The warm-season NC CDHW frequency exhibited salient year-to-year variation. We identified that the extensive equivalent barotropic high-pressure anomaly centered around Lake Baikal could be the predominant local-scale driving factor. In addition, the low-pressure circulation anomaly to the southeast played a secondary dynamic amplification role. Such a dipole pattern can jointly cause more frequent occurrences of NC CDHWs by triggering anomalies in localized meteorological variables (e.g., surface warming and drying) and land surface variable (reduced soil moisture) that are favorable for CDHW formation during the warm season. Regarding remote driving factors, central eastern Maritime Continent (MC) convection centered over New Guinea could be an influential and direct atmospheric forcing factor. Meanwhile, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly pattern over the tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) was identified as a crucial oceanic forcing indirectly modulating the NC CDHW frequency through the critical me-dium of MC convection. Through a Hadley-like meridional overturning circulation pattern, the suppressed MC convection can remotely induce a dipolar pattern similar to that related to a higher NC CDHW frequency, exerting a so-called direct modulation effect. Furthermore, positive TEP SST anomalies act as anomalous Rossby wave sources via anomalous upper-tropospheric divergence, characterized by westward-propagating descending Rossby waves with notable wave energy advecting westward toward the central-eastern MC. In such a scenario, a reversed Walker-like circulation pattern can form to sustain the suppressed MC convection, playing an inter-mediate role in the maintenance of the high-pressure anomaly centered around Lake Baikal. Our findings may provide new insights into the synergistic roles of distant climatic driving factors in the modulation and main-tenance of interannual variations of warm-season NC CDHW.

Changes in terrestrial water storage produce responses in the Earth's gravitational field and crustal deformation. Here, we use techniques from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to reveal a normal pattern of inter-annual fluctuations in the water level in the North American Great Lakes (GL). The GRACE-estimated time series was in good agreement with in situ water level measurements from 2002 to 2018, especially in terms of phases. The amplitude of 3-4 inter-annual signals in water thickness was 4-6 cm, which is equivalent to a 50-75 km(3) oscillation in surface water volume within the entire GL. The slightly larger annual and inter-annual fluctuation amplitudes estimated using GRACE data indicate that the aquifer system of the GL and its surroundings also contributes to seasonal mass changes. After 2013, water levels in the GL region rose abruptly, and the water mass increased by nearly 270 km(3) until the end of 2018. We also used GPS-and GRACE-derived three-component displacements (vertical, northward, and eastward) to identify load patterns. GPS-and GRACE-estimated maximum probability source directions based on multi-channel singular spectrum analysis showed that most of the selected GPS sites point to the GL region, although the direction deviations of GPS results at a few sites are mainly caused by the combined effect of the local load and superposition of the distant GL. Our findings indicate that inter-annual displacement changes at different frequencies (1-to 8-year cycle) are primarily due to water volume fluctuations in the GL. The amplitudes estimated by GPS are greater than the GRACE-based and GL-modeled results at most stations, which reflects sensitivity differences between these geodetic solutions to the surface load, as hydrological processes in the local area around a station are difficult to identify using GRACE data with a resolution of similar to 300 km.					; Kaban, Mikhail/ABA-7286-2020	Thomas, Maik/0009-0009-6964-3884; Wang, Linsong/0000-0002-3980-479X													0034-4257	1879-0704				JUN 1	2022	274								113001	10.1016/j.rse.2022.113001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113001		MAR 2022											WOS:000798849900001

In part attributable to habitat loss and degradation, the Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) is considered at risk across most of its range. Because little information for this species exists for the many islands of Georgian Bay, the world's largest freshwater archipelago, we conducted an intensive study on the habitat use of 12 turtles (6 males, 6 females) on a protected island. We used a combination of radio tracking and GPS loggers to determine habitat use during the active seasons of 2011 and 2012. We used aerial imagery to quantify available habitat and used compositional analyses to determine habitat selection. Both sexes used vernal pools and wet forest to move between habitat patches. Females used inland wetlands early in the year and coastal wetlands during the nesting season, whereas males maintained extensive use of inland wetlands during the entire active season. An effective conservation strategy for Blanding's turtles in Georgian Bay must include protection of inland and coastal wetlands, in addition to the surrounding upland matrix and connecting corridors.

Abundance and distribution of transparent exopolymer particles in the estuarine turbidity maximum of Chesapeake Bay	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Transparent exopolymer particle (TEP) concentrations were measured in the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region of Chesapeake Bay during 8 research cruises over 2 yr. TEP concentrations ranged from 37 to 2820 mu g xanthan gum equivalent l(-1) and accounted for an estimated average (+/- SD) of 32 +/- 16% of particulate organic carbon (POC). Spatially averaged TEP and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations were positively correlated over the 2 yr period, although these parameters were rarely correlated on a sample-to-sample basis. Maximum TEP concentrations were often spatially separated from chl a maxima, suggesting that TEP in ETM regions is controlled by formation, concentration, and transport processes rather than proximity to precursor source material. Significant correlations between TEP and phaeophytin a, POC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total suspended solids, and degree of stratification were observed during some sampling periods. Settling tube experiments revealed a positive correlation between TEP concentration and the fraction of settling particulate matter, indicating either enhanced local aggregation and settling or transport and accumulation of aggregates formed elsewhere in the ETM region. These results indicate that TEP constitutes a very large fraction of POC in ETM regions, and suggest that TEP contributes to the formation and maintenance of ETM.					; Sanford, Lawrence/O-5218-2014; Crump, Byron/ABF-3711-2020	Crump, Byron/0000-0001-7062-1273; 													0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	486						23	35		10.3354/meps10362	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10362													WOS:000321776600003

Bacterial methanotrophs drive the formation of a seasonal anoxic benthic nepheloid layer in an alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the formation and microbial composition of a seasonal benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) in the eutrophic, monomictic southern basin of Lake Lugano. During stratification, a BNL developed at the sedimentwater interface and progressively expanded 20- 30 m into the water column, following the rising oxic- anoxic interface. The dominance of the fatty acids C-16:1 omega 5, C-16:1 omega 6, C-16:1 omega 7, and C-16:1 omega 8, with delta C-13 values between 262% (v6) and -80% (omega 7), suggests that the BNL was composed primarily of Type I aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB). Indeed, MOB contributed. 75% to the fatty acid carbon pool in the fully developed BNL, with cell densities up to 8.5 3 105 cells mL21. In ex situ incubation experiments, CH4 turnover rate coefficients were up to 2.1 d21, which translates into potential CH4 oxidation rates as high as 20 mmol m23 delta 21 under in situ CH4 concentrations. CH4 oxidation was limited by the diffusive supply of O-2, and O-2 consumption by aerobic CH4 oxidation (up to 13.1 mmol m22 d21) appears to be the primary driver of the seasonal growth of the BNL and expansion of the hypolimnetic anoxic zone. Methanotrophic activity at the interface between oxic and anoxic water masses can actuate the formation of a BNL, which in turn functions as an effective microbial CH4 filter in the water column, preventing CH4 transport to surface waters and evasion to the atmosphere. In situ biomass production by methanotrophic bacteria may represent, in addition to sediment resuspension and detritus trapping, a novel BNL formation mechanism.

Therefore, this study focuses on the analysis and characterization of hydrological droughts under the future impacts of climate change using the SWAT model in the Lake Tana sub-basin. Future projections of climate data were obtained from dynamically reduced daily precipitation and temperatures from the CORDEX-Africa Program. The potential impact of climate change was examined under the RCP 4.5 emission scenarios for the time horizon 2011-2031, 2032-2052, and 2053-2073 with the baseline 1986-2005. For this study, the widely used modified Mann-Kendall test was run at a 10% significance level on time series data for each of the seven stations. The result of the Mann-Kendall (S) statistical test indicates that the temperature increases by 0.85 degrees C per decade and the precipitation increases insignificantly in all seasons. The standard streamflow index (SSFI) was used to characterize hydrological drought under historical and future climate change in the Tana sub-basin. The severity, duration, and frequency of hydrological drought were calculated on time scales from 6 to 24 months. Hydrological drought occurred in the Tana sub-basin due to climate change. This was achieved through the development of drought indices that are capable of timely characterizing and evaluating drought at different temporal scales. Assessing the future impacts of climate change on the characteristics of hydrological droughts is one of the important measures to implement sustainable water resource management and effective disaster mitigation in the sub-basin.

It was verified by one-way ANOVA that the spatial variability of the bacterioplankton community composition over the whole river was stronger than the seasonal variation. Salinity was a major factor leading to spatial differentiation of the microbial community structure into riverine and estuarial parts. A high temperature influence on the seasonal bacterial community variation was only apparent within certain kinds of environments (e.g., the riverine part). Bacterial community richness and diversity both exhibited significant spatial changes, and their seasonal variations were completely different in the two environments studied here. Furthermore, riverine bacterial community assemblages were subdivided into urban and rural groups due to changes in the nutritional state of the river. In addition, the nutrient -loving group including Limnohabitans, Hydrogenophaga, and Polynucleobacter were abundant in the urbanized Haihe River, indicating the environmental factors in these anthropogenic waterbodies heavily influence the core freshwater community composition.					; Wang, Yingying/HMD-1477-2023; Zou, Changliang/JPA-1473-2023; Bartlam, Mark/OGP-6431-2025; Liu, Jie/GRN-8750-2022	Bartlam, Mark/0000-0001-5173-5080; Liu, Jie/0000-0002-3849-6414														1664-302X				MAR 3	2016	7								250	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00250	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00250													WOS:000371209600001

A total of 4372 phytolith particles were counted from the leaves and classified into six types. The types of phytoliths are saddle, lanceolate, bulliform, and rondels, elongated, favose. Phytoliths in P. communis are sensitive to change in humidity. The main types from the five sampling sites are identical. The proportion of saddle phytoliths is greater than other phytoliths types. However, the quantity of phytoliths in P. communis differs markedly across the five sampling sites. In Shalan, Changchun, and Changling, the corresponding proportions of the saddle type are 28.1%, 25.4%, and 37.6%. In samples representing the aquatic, seasonal waterlogged, and mesic sampling sites from Nanhu Lake in Changchun, the corresponding proportions for saddle phytoliths are 32.6%, 20.6%, and 23.0%. The size of phytoliths, tested by CA, VA and PCA, to some extent indicates that the humidity is the main factor affecting the phytoliths. In Shalan, Changchun, and Changling, as humidity decreases, the phytoliths grow larger. In Nanhu Lake, as humidity decreases, the phytoliths grow smaller. The result reveals that phytoliths in P. communis are both sensitive to temperature and humidity. For regional research, temperature is the most important factor in the formation of phytoliths. Lanceolate phytoliths are sensitive to habitat change, and the saddle phytoliths are also sensitive to regional differences. Compared with the long cell phytoliths, short cell phytoliths as a proxy indicator of paleoclimate are more convincing. Overall, the results confirm that humidity is one of the dominant variables controlling the formation of phytoliths, which provides a new thinking for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.

Lake Balaton (Hungary) provided a unique study system as approximately half of its shoreline (c.105 km) has been modified. Littoral macroinvertebrates were collected in two habitat types (artificial rip-rap and natural reed) around the shoreline over two seasons. We found that native taxon richness of rip-rap habitat was only one-twentieth of the natural reed habitat. Rip-rap habitat harboured significantly more alien species. We found that the proportion of alien taxa was higher in rip-rap habitat (89.2%) than in reed habitat (16.7%). The composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the two habitats was also significantly different with limited to moderate overlap. Furthermore, all 8 indicator taxa of rip-rap habitat were alien, whilst all 28 indicator taxa were native in reed habitat. These results suggest that artificial engineering structure creates a novel ecosystem dominated by alien species.

Soil CO2 flux and photoautotrophic community composition in high-elevation, 'barren' soil	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Soil-dominated ecosystems, with little or no plant cover (i.e. deserts, polar regions, high-elevation areas and zones of glacial retreat), are often described as 'barren', despite their potential to host photoautotrophic microbial communities. In high-elevation, subnival zone soil (i.e. elevations higher than the zone of continuous vegetation), the structure and function of these photoautotrophic microbial communities remains essentially unknown. We measured soil CO2 flux at three sites (above 3600 m) and used molecular techniques to determine the composition and distribution of soil photoautotrophs in the Colorado Front Range. Soil CO2 flux data from 2002 and 2007 indicate that light-driven CO2 uptake occurred on most dates. A diverse community of Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi and eukaryotic algae was present in the top 2 cm of the soil, whereas these clades were nearly absent in deeper soils (2-4 cm). Cyanobacterial communities were composed of lineages most closely related to Microcoleus vaginatus and Phormidium murrayi, eukaryotic photoautotrophs were dominated by green algae, and three novel clades of Chloroflexi were also abundant in the surface soil. During the light hours of the 2007 snow-free measurement period, CO2 uptake was conservatively estimated to be 23.7 g C m(-2) season(-1). Our study reveals that photoautotrophic microbial communities play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of subnival zone soil.

J	Górniak, A				Gorniak, Andrzej			A new version of the Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index to evaluate dystrophy in lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Dystrophic freshwaters referred to as humic, brown, or black waters are typical for boreal or some mountainous regions where fens and coniferous forests form a significant part of basins. I evaluated the usefulness of the Hydrochemical Dystrophy Index (HDI) which has been developed for dystrophic lakes in Poland, on the basis of a rich database for lakes in Sweden and data provided by other researchers for lakes from Finland and Russia. I propose a new version of HDI for synthetic and quantitative description of habitat conditions in lakes and for use in limnological monitoring of protected areas. The state of dystrophy was evaluated using data for surface water pH, electric conductivity (EC), DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) concentrations. HDI values between 50 and 65 indicate semidystrophic conditions and with advanced a real dystrophy, they reach HDI values from 65 up to 100. Long term data shows that lake dystrophy is fairly steady with seasonal fluctuations. I show that the level of lake dystrophy is not correlated to latitude, but rather to small lake areas, regional geochemical spots, and favorable local hydrological conditions. A summary description of the main parameters of various types of humic lakes is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, YX; Li, DH				Li, Yinxia; Li, Dunhai			Competition between toxic Microcystis aeruginosa and nontoxic Microcystis wesenbergii with Anabaena PCC7120	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												To elucidate the changes in the proportions of microcystin (MC)-producing Microcystis, non-MC-producing Microcystis and Anabaena strains during cyanobacteria blooms, we compared their fitness under different initial biomass ratios. Culture experiments were carried out with three cyanobacterial strains: single-celled toxic Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 (Ma7806), single-celled nontoxic Microcystis wesenbergii FACHB-929 (Mw929) and filamentous Anabaena PCC7120 (An7120). Growth curves expressed as biovolume, Ma7806 microcystin-LR (MC-LR) content (detected with HPLC and ELISA), and the culture medium dissolved total nitrogen and dissolved total phosphorous (DTP) were measured to monitor nutrient uptake. Results suggest that the dominant strain in competition experiments between Ma7806 and An7120 was mainly controlled by the initial biomass ratio of the two strains, but there was also evidence for allelopathic interactions, where MC-LR produced by Ma7806 played an important role in the competition process. However, Mw929 was always less competitive when co-cultured with An7120 regardless of initial biomass ratio. Culture medium DTP showed significant differences between competition experiments in all sets, suggesting that Mw929 could be more suited to low phosphorus environments than Ma7806 and An7120. Overall, the competitive ability of Ma7806 was stronger than Mw929 when co-cultured with An7120 in the case of excess nutrients and the results could well unravel the seasonal succession process of cyanobacteria blooms.					; Li, Dunhai/F-8851-2012	Li, Dunhai/0000-0002-1915-4216; 													0921-8971	1573-5176				JAN	2012	24	1					69	78		10.1007/s10811-010-9648-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-010-9648-x													WOS:000299122200008

Microbial diversity, genomics, and phage-host interactions of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms	MSYSTEMS												The occurrence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) is related to their physical and chemical environment. However, less is known about their associated microbial interactions and processes. In this study, cyanoHABs were analyzed as a microbial ecosystem, using 1 year of 16S rRNA sequencing and 70 metagenomes collected during the bloom season from Lake Okeechobee (Florida, USA). Biogeographical patterns observed in microbial community composition and function reflected ecological zones distinct in their physical and chemical parameters that resulted in bloom "hotspots" near major lake inflows. Changes in relative abundances of taxa within multiple phyla followed increasing bloom severity. Functional pathways that correlated with increasing bloom severity encoded organic nitrogen and phosphorus utilization, storage of nutrients, exchange of genetic material, phage defense, and protection against oxidative stress, suggesting that microbial interactions may promote cyanoHAB resilience. Cyanobacterial communities were highly diverse, with picocyanobacteria ubiquitous and oftentimes most abundant, especially in the absence of blooms. The identification of novel bloom-forming cyanobacteria and genomic comparisons indicated a functionally diverse cyanobacterial community with differences in its capability to store nitrogen using cyanophycin and to defend against phage using CRISPR and restriction-modification systems. Considering blooms in the context of a microbial ecosystem and their interactions in nature, physiologies and interactions supporting the proliferation and stability of cyanoHABs are proposed, including a role for phage infection of picocyanobacteria. This study displayed the power of "-omics" to reveal important biological processes that could support the effective management and prediction of cyanoHABs.IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms pose a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Although physical and chemical conditions in aquatic systems that facilitate bloom development are well studied, there are fundamental gaps in the biological understanding of the microbial ecosystem that makes a cyanobacterial bloom. High-throughput sequencing was used to determine the drivers of cyanobacteria blooms in nature. Multiple functions and interactions important to consider in cyanobacterial bloom ecology were identified. The microbial biodiversity of blooms revealed microbial functions, genomic characteristics, and interactions between cyanobacterial populations that could be involved in bloom stability and more coherently define cyanobacteria blooms. Our results highlight the importance of considering cyanobacterial blooms as a microbial ecosystem to predict, prevent, and mitigate them.

Distribution and risk appraisal of dissolved trace elements in Begnas Lake and Rupa Lake, Gandaki Province, Nepal	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												Contamination of the trace elements (TEs) in the freshwater ecosystems is becoming a worldwide problem. This study was carried out to investigate the TEs contamination, and their associated health risk in Begnas Lake and Rupa Lake, Gandaki Province, Nepal. A total of 30 water samples were collected from both lakes during the pre-monsoon season in 2016. The samples were analyzed for the TEs including copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), cesium (Cs), and arsenic (As) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results exhibited that the mean concentrations of all the TEs were higher in Rupa Lake as compared to Begnas Lake except Pb. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed that both the geogenic and anthropic sources were the major contributors of TEs in the lake water. Anthropic activities were considered to contribute the TEs like Zn and Mn in lake water mainly via agricultural runoff, while evaluating the risk of TEs on human health all the elements showed HQ<1 and CR<10(-4) indicating currently very low health risk concerns. In good agreement with above, the water quality index (WQI) of the Begnas Lake and Rupa Lake was 2.67 and 5.66, respectively, specifying the lake water was safe for drinking and public health concern. This appraisal would help the policymakers and concerned stakeholders for the sustainable management of Ramsar listed freshwater lakes in the Himalayas.

However, such studies remain scarce for high-altitude lakes in general and specifically for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the hydro-chemical and physical properties of lake Nam Co and its twenty-one major inflowing rivers from 2011 to 2013. The modern sediment flux and sediment properties were determined for samples collected by sediment traps deployed for the same study period at different water depths at three sites in Nam Co. Carbonate weathering in the catchment, especially pronounced during the monsoon season, was identified as the predominant origin of dissolved riverine hydrochemical components. The sediment budget shows remarkable temporal variation, with trends of intensified sediment fluxes during the non-monsoon season and small variations within the monsoon season. Spatially, considerably higher sedimentation fluxes were detected in nearshore sites (T1 and T3) and attributed to wind-induced resuspension. Vertically, resuspension is also an important factor that influences the sedimentation process, which leads to an exponential increase of the budget from the surface to the bottom layer. Autochthonous carbonate deposition rates presented a similar seasonal pattern, with the total sedimentation rates under the influence of the water balance. Low values occurred during the monsoon season due to dilution while deposition rapidly increased during the early post-monsoon season when the lake level decreased. Intensive carbonate deposition also occurred during the non-monsoon season, which dominated the lake hydrochemistry dynamics. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Recent Travel History and Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Infection in a Region of Heterogenous Transmission in Southern Province, Zambia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												As Zambia continues to reduce its malaria incidence and target elimination in Southern Province, there is a need to identify factors that can reintroduce parasites and sustain malaria transmission. To examine the relative contributions of types of human mobility on malaria prevalence, this analysis quantifies the proportion of the population having recently traveled during both peak and nonpeak transmission seasons over the course of 2 years and assesses the relationship between short-term travel and malaria infection status. Among all residents targeted by mass drug administration in the Lake Kariba region of Southern Province, 602,620 rapid diagnostic tests and recent travel histories were collected during four campaign rounds occurring between December 2014 and February 2016. Rates of short-term travel in the previous 2 weeks fluctuated seasonally from 0.3% to 1.2%. Travel was significantly associated with prevalent malaria infection both seasonally and overall (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.55; 95% CI: 2.28-2.85). The strength of association between travel and malaria infection varied by travelers' origin and destination, with those recently traveling to high-prevalence areas from low-prevalence areas experiencing the highest odds of malaria infection (AOR: 7.38). Longlasting insecticidal net usage while traveling was associated with a relative reduction in infections (AOR: 0.74) compared with travelers not using a net. Although travel was directly associated with only a small fraction of infections, importation of malaria via human movement may play an increasingly important role in this elimination setting as transmission rates continue to decline.

We conducted an acoustic fine-scale tracking experiment from March to June 2017 to determine the common carp movement pattern and habitat use in the downstream area of the Pearl River. The eight tagged common carp were detected for 39.38 +/- 29.57 d, on average, with a total average detection period of 42.12 +/- 28.02 d. A general linear mixed model suggested they were detected more during the night than during the day. Common carp preferred habitats near the sandbar and riparian shallow habitats, as revealed by their movement tracks and habitat selection indexes. The general additive mixed model (GAMM) analysis of their shortest distances to riverbanks and depth indicated that they migrated to shallower riparian habitat more frequently during the night than during the day. The continuous wavelet spectrum further confirmed the significant diel pattern of their vertical movement. Their habitat use was also influenced by the water temperature, water level, and river discharge, as suggested by the GAMM. Our results provide novel information on common carp spatiotemporal movement and habitat use patterns, and have important implications for its native population restoration and the invasive population control/exclusion.					; Zhang, Lili/G-2365-2017; Zhang, Yingqiu/C-4471-2014	Li, Xinhui/0000-0002-3830-4996; 														2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2233	10.3390/w12082233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082233													WOS:000567074000001

The sedimentary architecture of a shallow-water delta shows distinctive differences with that of a deep-slope delta. These differences may be associated with the mechanism and characteristics of the deposition in the area where the sediments unloaded. Based on modern sedimentary research of the Poyang Lake in China, this paper focuses on the processes of river flow entering a lake with a low dip angle. We conducted six sets of numerical simulations with different initial sedimentary flow velocities using Fluent software for analyzing the hydrodynamics and the sediment transportation in the shallow-water delta. We combined the simulation results with an analysis of the geomorphology of the Gangjiang Delta to reveal the deposition along the shoreline of the lacustrine shallow-water delta. The numerical simulation shows that the shallow-water delta is dominated by bed friction with an extensive hydrodynamical boundary layer. The bed shear stress, which varies with the changes in river flux, dominated the sediment transport and deposition at the shallow-water delta front, where the effluent flow mixes with lake water. The distributary channels show characteristics of repeatedly occurred erosion, scouring, filling, and reoccupation. We argue that the depositional characteristics are associated with the changes in bed shear stress controlled by variation of flow velocity. Mouth bars are less likely to grow to a reasonable scale because of the seasonal scouring of extreme floods. Moreover, the lake flow potentially reworks the mouth bars. Consequently, mouth bar deposits were difficult to preserve as hydrocarbon reservoirs in ancient shallow-water delta.

Christian			Reproductive success and contaminant associations in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) used to assess a Beneficial Use Impairment in US and Binational Great Lakes' Areas of Concern	ECOTOXICOLOGY												During 2010-2014, tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) reproductive success was monitored at 68 sites across all 5 Great Lakes, including 58 sites located within Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs) and 10 non-AOCs. Sample eggs were collected from tree swallow clutches and analyzed for contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins and furans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and 34 other organic compounds. Contaminant data were available for 360 of the clutches monitored. Markov chain multistate modeling was used to assess the importance of 5 ecological variables and 11 of the dominant contaminants in explaining the pattern of egg and nestling failure rates. Four of 5 ecological variables (Female Age, Date within season, Year, and Site) were important explanatory variables. Of the 11 contaminants, only total dioxin and furan toxic equivalents (TEQs) explained a significant amount of the egg failure probabilities. Neither total PCBs nor PCB TEQs explained the variation in egg failure rates. In a separate analysis, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure in nestling diet, used as a proxy for female diet during egg laying, was significantly correlated with the daily probability of egg failure. The 8 sites within AOCs which had poorer reproduction when compared to 10 non-AOC sites, the measure of impaired reproduction as defined by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, were associated with exposure to dioxins and furan TEQs, PAHs, or depredation. Only 2 sites had poorer reproduction than the poorest performing non-AOC. Using a classic (non-modeling) approach to estimating reproductive success, 82% of nests hatched at least 1 egg, and 75% of eggs laid, excluding those collected for contaminant analyses, hatched.

Changes in Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) Fluorescence in Proglacial Antarctic Streams	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) exported in glacier meltwater influences downstream biogeochemical processes, and climate warming may increase the meltwater DOM flux. In this study, we quantify and use fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to characterize DOM exported in glacier meltwater in Taylor and Wright Valleys, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Andersen Creek, a proglacial stream draining Canada Glacier meltwater, exported similar to 20 kg of DOM as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to Lake Hoare during the melt season. Supraglacial snowpack DOM from all of the Dry Valley glaciers sampled exhibits "protein-like" fluorescence indicating that it contains potentially labile moieties that might be a favorable substrate supporting downstream microbial metabolism. However, this protein-like fluorescence does not persist in any of the meltwater streams surveyed, suggesting that it is quickly transformed by resident microbial populations and/or mixed with other DOM pools within stream channels or along its margins. Given the seemingly ubiquitous protein-like fluorescent characteristic of glacier-derived DOM and the immediate change to the bulk DOM in glacier streams, a more thorough characterization of the bulk DOM pool from glacial sources and through downstream ecosystems would yield valuable information about the potential contribution of glacier melt to the global carbon cycle.

The results are shown as follows. (1) The influence periods are from 25 May to 10 June, from 1 July to 31 August, from 15 September to 31 October and from December to the next April, among which the influence of the water-supplement dispatch in the dry season is not very sensitive. (2) During the period under the pre-discharge dispatch, the runoff volume slightly increases as well as both the average water level and the highest water level rise in the usual year. While in the wet and dry years, the average increase in the runoff volume is 40.25x10(8) m(3) and the average rises of the average water level and the highest water level are both 1.06 m. (3) As for the flood-storage dispatch, the flood volume increases slightly, in the dry and wet years, the flood volume, the average water level and the highest water level averagely reduce by 444.02x10(8) m(3), 2.64 m and 1.42 m respectively. (4) Under the water-storage dispatch, the runoff volume slightly increases and the water level heightens in a sort in the usual year. And in the dry and wet years, the average decreases in the runoff volume, the average water level and the highest water levels are respectively 185.27x10(8) m(3), 3.13 m and 2.14 m. (5) During the period under the water-supplement dispatch, the runoff volume, the average water level and the highest water levels averagely decline by 337.7x10(8) m(3), 1.89 m and 2.39 m respectively in the usual and wet years. However, in the dry year, the runoff volume increases as well as the average and highest water levels slightly go up.																			1009-637X					AUG	2012	22	4					594	608		10.1007/s11442-012-0949-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-012-0949-7													WOS:000305248600002

Nitrogen dynamics of a large-scale constructed wetland used to remove excess nitrogen from eutrophic lake water	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Nitrogen loss from landscapes affects downstream freshwater and marine systems. Constructed wetlands, which are ecologically-engineered systems, can mitigate nitrogen loss from various landscape types. We examined the efficacy of a large-scale constructed wetland (the marsh flow-way at Lake Apopka) to remove particulate nitrogen and other nitrogen species from eutrophic lake water. During the first seven years of operation, the hydraulic loading rate to the flow-way was high (mean +/- SD; 34 +/- 10 m yr(-1)). Inflow concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) were also high and variable (mean +/- SD; 4 +/- 1 mg L-1). Both hydraulic loading rate and concentration of N species were affected by variations in lake level. Inflow nitrogen was mostly in particulate forms (particulate organic nitrogen [PON] was 58% of TN). Subsequently, the dominant biogeochemical mechanism for nitrogen removal was sedimentation of PON. Average annual removal rates were 56 g PON m(-2) yr(-1), while TN and total Kjeldahl nitrogen removal rates were similar, about 30 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Nitrogen removal was seasonally dependent, with greatest removal rates occurring during cool periods (October through May). Although the marsh flow-way showed substantial removal of particulate N, the wetland released dissolved inorganic N fractions. Release of ammonium (NH4) averaged 21 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Release of NH4 was greatest during warm periods (June through September), which was probably related to increased water temperature, associated increased decomposition, and decreased dissolved oxygen content of wetland waters. Long-term first order rate constants (k) for removal were also high. Annual k values for PON were 85 m yr(-1). Managing the marsh flow-way to maximize particulate N removal in the long-term, while mitigating the release of inorganic N during warm periods, will require dynamic wetland management.

Diel vertical migration of adult burbot: a dynamic trade-off among feeding opportunity, predation avoidance, and bioenergetic gain	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Diel vertical migration (DVM) of pelagic organisms is typically attributed to bioenergetic gain, foraging opportunity, predator avoidance, and multifactor hypotheses. While a number of benthic species perform nightly migrations into shallower waters, the function of these DVMs has largely been ignored in benthic fishes. We used depth and temperature sensing telemetry to investigate DVM function in burbot (Lota lota), a freshwater benthic piscivore. We modeled the influence of season, diel period, and body size on the depth, vertical activity, migration probability, and thermal experience of 47 adult burbot over 2 years in a reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. Burbot were found to occupy significantly shallower water at night than during the day. Our results, which showed elevated nightly activity and a seasonal size-structured depth distribution during DVMs, suggest these migrations likely provide a feeding opportunity "window" for this nocturnal predator, constrained by predation or cannibalism threats to smaller individuals. The observed thermal experience patterns suggest DVM may also provide a seasonal bioenergetic advantage. Our detection of within-individual plasticity in migration strategy is indicative of a partial migration. Taken together, our results suggest a multifactor DVM hypothesis: a dynamic trade-off among bioenergetic advantage, foraging opportunity, and predation threat.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Gutowsky, Lee/0000-0003-1244-9465; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2013	70	12					1765	1774		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0183													WOS:000328273100010

Anoxic bottom conditions resulted from a surplus of organic matter (OM), in the early stage indicated by irregularly laminated sediments comprising abundant iron-sulfide framboids. Their diagenetic formation predates the preservation of biochemical calcite varves. In the larger, deeper Lake Tiefer See near Klocksin, anoxia developed stepwise. A first anoxic pulse was contemporary with inflow narrowing by railway-dam construction and accumulation of OM. It was favored by a decrease of the intensity of lake circulation (turnover). Nutrients introduced from artificial fertilizer then increased the primary production (diatoms) to the point of OM surplus and seasonal laminae formation started 40 years later in 1924. In the smaller, shallower Lake Tiefer See in the Uckermark, a massive pulse of iron sulfide was centered around 1960, seven years after installation of piped field drainage into the lake. Anoxia developed rapidly with the nutrients drained from a fertilized groundwater catchment that is 10 times larger than the surface catchment, while surface erosion was reduced. Reducing bottom conditions became regular and the seasonal lamination was preserved after 1967. Morphological criteria to screen lakes for varved sediments should include reductions of natural lake inflow and catchment increase, such as by inflow of field drainage. Similar developments of increased nutrient input or intensity decrease of lake circulation may result from historical human activities but also from natural processes.

Tracing natural groundwater recharge to the Thiaroye aquifer of Dakar, Senegal	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Urban groundwater in Sub-Saharan Africa provides vital freshwater to rapidly growing cities. In the Thiaroye aquifer of Dakar (Senegal), groundwater within Quaternary unconsolidated sands provided nearly half of the city's water supply into the 1980s. Rising nitrate concentrations traced to faecal contamination sharply curtailed groundwater withdrawals, which now contribute just 5% to Dakar's water supply. To understand the attenuation capacity of this urban aquifer under a monsoonal semi-arid climate, stable-isotope ratios of O and H and radioactive tritium (H-3), compiled over several studies, are used together with piezometric data to trace the origin of groundwater recharge and groundwater flowpaths. Shallow groundwaters derive predominantly from modern rainfall (tritium >2 TU in 85% of sampled wells). O-18 and H-2 values in groundwater vary by>4 and 20, respectively, reflecting substantial variability in evaporative enrichment prior to recharge. These signatures in groundwater regress to a value on the local meteoric water line that is depleted in heavy isotopes relative to the weighted-mean average composition of local rainfall, a bias that suggests recharge derives preferentially from isotopically depleted rainfall observed during the latter part of the monsoon (September). The distribution of tritium in groundwater is consistent with groundwater flowpaths to seasonal lakes and wetlands, defined by piezometric records. Piezometric data further confirm the diffuse nature and seasonality of rain-fed recharge. The conceptual understanding of groundwater recharge and flow provides a context to evaluate attenuation of anthropogenic recharge that is effectively diffuse and constant from the vast network of sanitation facilities that drain to this aquifer.					; Diongue, Djim Mouhamadou Lamine/ABB-8888-2022; Taylor, Richard/AAA-8512-2021	Wohnlich, Stefan/0000-0002-0033-425X; Diongue, Djim Mouhamadou Lamine/0000-0003-0905-9263; Pouye, Abdoulaye/0000-0003-3947-0045; Taylor, Richard/0000-0002-9867-8033; Faye, Serigne/0000-0002-1679-2351; FAYE, Seynabou Cisse/0000-0001-5334-6003													1431-2174	1435-0157				MAY	2019	27	3			SI		1067	1080		10.1007/s10040-018-01923-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-01923-8													WOS:000467483100016

Herein, the anticipated SWOT storage change accuracy is evaluated for the lakes in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Northern Alaska and Western Siberia. Because of the significant lack of Arctic lake measurements, we simulated realistic daily to seasonal changes in water elevations in the study region using a combination of data from lake gauges, satellite radar altimeter, and satellite imagery. This 'truth' dataset is sampled with several candidate SWOT orbits and then corrupted with expected instrument errors to simulate SWOT observed storage changes. The number of revisits increases with increasing or decreasing latitude for a given repeat cycle (e.g. four to eight revisits for a 22-day cycle), allowing us to investigate storage change errors at monthly sampling. SWOT storage change accuracy is primarily controlled by lake size. Lakes larger than 1 km2 have relative errors generally less than 5% whereas one-hectare size lakes are about 20%. We concluded that the storage change accuracy is insensitive to the orbital inclination or repeat periods, but is sensitive to lake shapes.					; Durand, Michael/D-2885-2013; Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021; Sheng, Yongwei/HNP-7933-2023	Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533; Jung, Hahn Chul/0000-0002-6330-1834; Durand, Michael/0000-0003-2682-6196; Shum, C K/0000-0001-9378-4067; 													0143-1161						2010	31	14					3931	3953	PII 925190440	10.1080/01431161.2010.483494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.483494													WOS:000280618500015

The values of these factors vary depending on the climate and the severity of drought events. Droughts caused by a lack of precipitation and continuing in the warm season have a longer periodicity. This important statement raises the question of whether climate change may exacerbate the phenomenon of drought. Therefore, understanding the changes in the formation of hydrological droughts is key to foreseeing possible changes in the future. This scientific study analyses the spread of hydrometeorological droughts in the Ile-Balkash basin using standardized precipitation indices and the drought index of river runoff. Lake Balkash plays an important role in the hydrological cycle and is a valuable freshwater resource, especially in dry years. Prolonged droughts in the area have serious consequences, such as deterioration of water quality and loss of wetlands, which are important to the ecological system and migratory birds. The analysis shows that during the period of instrumental observations, several extreme hydrological droughts were observed in this area (1943-1946, 1973-1975, and 1983-1987), which emphasizes the relevance and importance of scientific research on the problem of drought.

This technology is particularly useful in monitoring wetlands, among other applications. It in this perceptive, this research aims to study the surface water ex-tent (SWE) variation of the Great Sebkha of Oran (GSO). A wetland area classified as Ramsar, bor-dering Oran city. Extended over nearly 40,000 ha, the water extent is influenced by climatic, geo-logical, and hydrological factors, which are typical of endorheic regions in semi-arid and arid cli-mates. However, over the last decade, these natural effects have been overtaxed by anthro-pogenic impacts caused by the strong urban expansion of the city of Oran. This is particularly evi-dent with the commissioning of the large El Kerma sewage wastewater treatment plant (WWTPK) in 2009. Located at NE edge of the GSO. The function of this plant is to treat a large proportion of the wastewater volume generated by the city of Oran. Nevertheless, for various reasons, a lag in the implantation of the various execution phases of a development project extended to the entire GSO basin has led to nearly a decade; the WWTPK has discharged partially treated wastewater di-rectly into GSO. This had a major impact on the mode of surface water extent change of the se-bkha and led to major pollution of the latter. To better understand the (SWE) dynamics, post and pre-discharges from the WWTPK in the sebkha were monitored monthly over 33 years (1987-2019). A consistent database of Landsat sensor images (TM, ETM+, and OLI) was col-lected and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to extract the SWE in the GSO, which was achieved using spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Nor-malized Difference Water Index (NDWI1 and NDWI2), Modified Normalized Difference Water In-dex (MNDWI) and Dryness/Wetness index (DWI). Subsequently, the SWE, correlated with precip-itation over the entire GSO watershed, was analyzed and discussed at different time steps: monthly, annual, and seasonal. Before 2009, the precipitation regime study concerning the SWE shows the complexity of the functional dynamics of the endorheic system of the GSO watershed. After 2009, the commissioning of WWTPK had disrupted the SWE variation of the GSO. The max-imum average of the SWE during the 2009-2019 sub-period was 169 km2, while it was 122 km2 during the undisturbed sub-period (1987-2008). The use of remote sensing data analysis con-tributes effectively to this work, representing proven results to protect this sensitive natural envi-ronment. They remain necessary to help decision-makers to ensure and preserve the sustainable ecological viability of the GSO and the natural environment of wetlands of the entire Oran sublit-toral furrow of Gdyel-Arzew: Daiet Morcelly, Telamine Lake, Sebkha golf Arzew.					; Kessar, Cherif/AEB-7781-2022	Kessar, Cherif/0000-0003-0229-9133; 													2352-9385					APR	2023	30								100953	10.1016/j.rsase.2023.100953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2023.100953		MAR 2023											WOS:000993262900001

Study focus: Large channel-type reservoirs are characterized by significant runoff, deep water, and narrow-and-long channel shape, creating unique hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions for their eco-environmental systems. However, the hydro-thermal processes of this type reservoir are not fully known. A large channel-type reservoir was selected to investigate the macroscopic processes through a field survey and employing a three-dimensional (3D) hydro-thermodynamic model.New hydrological insights for the region: The reservoir experienced a seasonal varying thermal stratification, with a vertical temperature difference of -9 degrees C. Meanwhile, a conjoint flow pattern was detected, consisting of an upper-layer warm water flow and a lower-layer circulation, which was very different from the lakes' wind-induced pattern. When the reservoir was stratified, the inflow warm water on the thermocline could produce a shear effect, promoting vertical mixing and further contributing to hypolimnion shrinking. The reservoir experienced a water age increase during the non-stratification period, with the near-dam age being -20 days. The trap effect of the lower-layer circulation retained the cold water in the hypolimnion during the stratification period, and the water age reached 115 days. The presented varying flow pattern and transport timescale have essential effects on the eco-environmental systems, providing practical insights into managing water quality and aquatic environment in reservoirs.					; Morovati, Khosro/R-7855-2019; Lidi, Shi/MGT-7997-2025; Liu, Zhaowei/R-9970-2016; zhu, xinyu/HJJ-1063-2023	Lidi, Shi/0000-0001-6746-2726; Sun, Jian/0000-0002-0508-7489; morovati, khosro/0000-0002-8867-4194; 														2214-5818				JUN	2023	47								101367	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101367		MAR 2023											WOS:001043842300001

Bonito fish are commonly consumed fresh, but also it can be preserved with dry salting or brine methods to produce traditional salted bonito (lakerda). However, gravlax is a high valued gastronomic product which is made from salmon with dill (Anethum graveolens) in principle, hereby gravlax curing method that can be applied to different fish species and aromatic herbs. The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics such as consumers' taste preferences, nutritional composition, colour and texture of bonito gravlax made with dill and garden cress (Lepidium sativum).& nbsp;The usage of dill or garden cress did not affect the crude protein values (p > 0.05). The moisture loss of group A (with dill) was higher than group B (with garden cress) (p < 0.05). The colour results proved that using garden cress instead of dill in bonito gravlax reduces the reddishness whereas increase the yellowish colour. delta E (total colour difference indicates) was determined that the using of garden cress was more effective on the colour change of raw fish. Also, usage of the herbs in gravlax processing were affected these parameters and it may cause to change on fish texture. According to sensory analysis made by panellists showed that the aroma and salty taste of the two groups were found to be different. On the other hand, the general acceptability results of the groups were found to be similar.

We defined 2440 sub-watersheds at the fifth-order level in China's DPR, and investigated the spatiotemporal variations in SWA and their substantial driving factors (such as temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and irrigation activity). The results showed that the average annual maximum SWA was 7165 km(2) in DPR from 2000 to 2019, of which 84% was the seasonal SWA. The seasonal and permanent SWA increased by 188 km(2) yr(-1) and 46 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. The SWA in non-DPR was the dominant driving factor for SWA dynamics in most basins except for HunlunBuir, Otindag and Ordos, where the irrigation activity showed significant contributions to SWA variations. Climate had a relatively low contribution to SWA variations in DPR. The role of SWA variations on desertification processes in DPR of China showed significant spatiotemporal differences from 2000 to 2019. The increased SWA promoted reversal of desertification in watersheds along the Tarim River, northwestern Junggar, eastern Ordos, and parts of Otindag, however, it did not help in northwestern Qinghai. Our findings provide a scientific insight into the characteristics of surface water resources and the relationship between SWA dynamics and desertification in the DPR of China.					wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021; Hu, Shi/ABE-4524-2021	Xiao, Feiyan/0000-0002-3836-6898; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN	2022	213								106182	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106182		MAR 2022											WOS:000790438200002

Here the sole recorded shell midden, at Rinnukalns in Latvia, is on an inland lake and is formed of massive dumps of freshwater shells. Recent excavations indicate that they are the product of a small number of seasonal events during the later fourth millennium BC. The thickness of the shell deposits suggests that this was a special multi-purpose residential site visited for seasonal aggregations by pottery-using hunter-gatherer communities on the northern margin of Neolithic Europe.					; Meadows, John/AAU-2326-2020	Meadows, John/0000-0002-4346-5591; Schmolcke, Ulrich/0000-0002-8974-449X; Lubke, Harald/0000-0003-0451-0588; Berzins, Valdis/0000-0003-3991-5147													0003-598X	1745-1744				SEP	2014	88	341					715	732		10.1017/S0003598X0005064X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003598X0005064X													WOS:000341801700002

Relationships Between Gravity Waves Observed at Earth's Surface and in the Stratosphere Over the Central and Eastern United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Observations of tropospheric gravity waves (GWs) made by the new and extensive USArray Transportable Array (TA) barometric network located east of the Rockies, in the central and eastern United States and of stratospheric (30-40 km above sea level) GWs made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are compared over a 5 year time span from 2010 through 2014. GW detections in the period band from 2 to 6 h made at the Earth's surface during the thunderstorm season from May through August each year exhibit the same broad spatial and temporal patterns as observed at stratospheric altitudes. At both levels, the occurrence frequency of GWs is higher at night than during the day and is highest to the west of the Great Lakes. Statistically significant correlations between the variance of the pressure at the TA, which is a proxy for GWs at ground level, with 8.1 mu m brightness temperature measurements from AIRS and rain radar precipitation data, which are both proxies for convective activity, indicate that GWs observed at the TA are related to convective sources. There is little, if any, time lag between the two. Correlations between GWs in the stratosphere and at ground level are weaker, possibly due to the AIRS observational filter effect, but are still statistically significant at nighttime. We conclude that convective activity to the west of the Great Lakes is the dominant source of GWs both at ground level and within the stratosphere. Plain Language Summary Observations of tropospheric gravity waves made by the USArray Transportable Array (TA) barometric network located in the central and eastern United States and of stratospheric gravity waves made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder were compared over a 5 year time span from 2010 through 2014. Analysis of the TA data shows a gravity wave hot spot that is located on the Earth's surface west of the Great Lakes. Gravity wave occurrence rates on the ground exhibit the same broad spatial and temporal patterns as observed at stratospheric altitudes. Evidence suggests that convective activity is the dominant source of gravity waves both at the ground and in the stratosphere.

Despite this health situation, there are few studies on the bionomics of anopheline larvae in such areas. This publication aims to identify the main larval habitats of the most abundant anopheline species and to assess their associations with some environmental factors. Methods: We conducted a 19-month longitudinal study from January 2013 to July 2014, sampling anopheline larvae in two indigenous Yanomami communities, comprised of four villages each. All natural larval habitats were surveyed every two months with a 350 ml manual dipper, following a standardized larval sampling methodology. In a third study area, we conducted two field expeditions in 2013 followed by four systematic collections during the long dry season of 2014-2015. Results: We identified 177 larval habitats in the three study areas, from which 9122 larvae belonging to 13 species were collected. Although species abundance differed between villages, An. oswaldoi (s.l.) was overall the most abundant species. Anopheles darlingi, An. oswaldoi (s.l.), An. triannulatus (s.s.) and An. mattogrossensis were primarily found in larval habitats that were partially or mostly sun-exposed. In contrast, An. costai-like and An. guarao-like mosquitoes were found in more shaded aquatic habitats. Anopheles darlingi was significantly associated with proximity to human habitations and larval habitats associated with river flood pulses and clear water. Conclusions: This study of anopheline larvae in the Brazilian Yanomami area detected high heterogeneities at micro-scale levels regarding species occurrence and densities. Sun exposure was a major modulator of anopheline occurrence, particularly for An. darlingi. Lakes associated with the rivers, and particularly oxbow lakes, were the main larval habitats for An. darlingi and other secondary malaria vectors. The results of this study will serve as a basis to plan larval source management activities in remote indigenous communities of the Amazon, particularly for those located within low-order river-floodplain systems.

J	Mechal, A; Karuppannan, S; Bayisa, A				Mechal, Abraham; Karuppannan, Shankar; Bayisa, Adula			Groundwater recharge estimation in the Ziway Lake Watershed, Ethiopian Rift: an approach using SWAT and CMB techniques	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The community in the Ethiopian Rift is highly dependent on groundwater for human consumption, irrigation purposes, and is also essential for the availability of surface water resources (e.g., rivers, lakes, and wetlands). Therefore, it is essential to quantify the spatial and temporal rate of replenishment of the aquifers in the region for sustainable water resource development and management. The aim of this study is to estimate the amount of recharge and its spatial distribution in the ZLW (Ziway Lake Watershed), situated in the central Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). For this purpose, the two widely applied groundwater recharge estimation methods, such as the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) and CMB (Chloride Mass Balance) techniques, were employed. Hydro-meteorological data from 1979 to 2014 was utilized for SWAT model setup, calibration, and validation purposes. The performance evaluation showed acceptable ranges of model evaluation indicators (R2 = 0.67-0.73, NSE = 0.63-0.7, and PBIAS = -0.83--12.1). The SWAT- simulated mean annual recharge (RCHG) showed a general decreasing trend from the opposite-facing rift margins (160 mm/year) towards the rift floor (35 mm/year) with an average value of 98.1 mm/year. Though the magnitude is different, a similar RCHG pattern is obtained using the RCHG rate estimated using the CMB approach over the same watershed, with a mean annual RCHG of 163.82 mm/year (18.39% of the precipitation). The SWAT-simulated RCHG value is lower than the RCHG computed by the CMB approach, indicating the importance of preferential RCHG, which the SWAT model does not capture. Therefore, the SWAT-simulated RCHG should be taken as the lowest plausible groundwater replenishment, while the RCHG estimated by the CMB method represents the highest plausible RCHG estimate for the watershed characterized by highly fractured volcanic and sediment aquifers. Besides the spatial variability, the simulation result also indicates that RCHG is highly variable with time. The RCHG rate is strongly associated with the annual precipitation trend and tracks a bimodal annual pattern of the dry and wet seasons. The RCHG variability across the study area is largely controlled by climate and topography, though the small-scale pattern within the physiographic regions is connected to variability in LULC types and soil hydraulic characteristics. Quantification of the RCHG for the ZLW has immense importance for policymakers and water resource experts for further water resource study and developmental activities in the region.

Lake Hongze is a reservoir for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project's Eastern Route and an essential water source for Jiangsu Province, China, and its water quality closely relates to the local aquatic ecosystem and affects the water supply security of the surrounding areas. The spatial and seasonal patterns of total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the lake were investigated and the effects of floods on these patterns were assessed. Hydrological data and trophic state parameters were analyzed using 7 years of monitoring data from 16 water sampling sites throughout the lake. The statistical analysis revealed the seasonal variation characteristics affected by floods and the differences in material transport continuity between inflow and outflow boundaries. Eutrophication assessment using the trophic level index and Chl-a concentrations also indicated eutrophication was concentrated at the southeast side of the lake. Spatial interpolation of Chl-a using the ordinary kriging method clarified that existence and movement of the localized eutrophication area in Lake Hongze. The mass balance calculations of TP indicated that a substantial amount of phosphorus entered the lake during the flood season, however, most severe algal blooms occurring after the flood season. The onset of algal blooms exhibits a significant time lag in response to phosphorus input, primarily due to the influence of hydrodynamic processes within the lake during the flood season.

This study aims to identify sensitive variables for predicting electrical conductivity (EC) in soil, focusing on effective feature selection methods. (2) The study systematically selects a feature subset from Sentinel-1 C SAR, Sentinel-2 MSI, and SRTM DEM data. Various feature selection methods (correlation analysis, LASSO, RFE, and GRA) are employed on 79 variables. Regression models using random forest regression (RF) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithms are constructed and compared. (3) The results highlight the effectiveness of the RFE algorithm in reducing model complexity. The model incorporates significant environmental factors like soil moisture, topography, and soil texture, which play an important role in modeling. Combining the method with RF improved soil salinity prediction (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 1.47, RPD = 1.84). Overall, salinization in Minqin oasis soils was evident, especially in the unutilized land at the edge of the oasis. (4) Integrating data from different sources to construct characterization variables overcomes the limitations of a single data source. Variable selection is an effective means to address the redundancy of variable information, providing insights into feature engineering and variable selection for soil salinity estimation in arid and semi-arid regions.

Spatial and seasonal variation in the phytoplankton community of Lake Victoria?s Mwanza Gulf, compared to northern parts of the lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We investigated the phytoplankton species composition and abundance in two seasons in Mwanza Gulf, Lake Victoria (Tanzania). Phytoplankton was sampled and chlorophyll a content was measured in the dry and wet seasons of 2010-2011 at three stations, from the southern land-inward end of the Gulf towards the open lake. Cyanobacteria, mostly small colonial and filamentous species (e.g., Aphanocapsa spp., Planktolyngbya spp., Merismopedia spp.) dominated at each station (76-95 %), followed by Chlorophyta (5-21 %), whereas the contribution of Bacillariophyceae was small (0-6 %). Phytoplankton densities were generally higher in the rainy season and strongly increased going land-inward from the open lake. Low abundance of N-fixing phytoplankton species suggests that N-fixation was low. The chlorophyll a content in the mouth of the Gulf was low (mean values 4-6 lg/L) compared to values reported previously. Also, chlorophyll a values (means 11-14 lg/L) at land-inward stations of Mwanza Gulf were much lower than those in the northern gulfs (Napoleon Gulf, Murchison Bay and Nyanza Gulf). Between 2002 and 2009 the phytoplankton composition of Mwanza Gulf changed from a community mostly dominated by Bacillariophyceae into a community dominated by Cyanobacteria. In the open water of Lake Victoria, Bacillariophyceae and Cyanobacteria were both abundant. Cyanobacteria dominated both in the three northern gulfs and Mwanza Gulf, but all four showed substantial differences in species and genus com-positions. Phytoplankton composition and abundance in Mwanza Gulf differs in many respects from the open water of Lake Victoria and its three northern gulfs.(c) 2023 The Authors.

However soda lakes are under several ecological changes, with unexpected shifts in biodiversity composition and physicochemical changes. This study focuses on assessing the community structure of zooplankton in Lake Shala. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from January to December 2018. A total of 32 zooplankton species were identified, of which 23 species were Rotifers and followed by Copepoda (6) and Cladocera (3). The community was dominated by Brachionus dimidiatus, B. dimidiatus inermis, B. plicatilis and B. calyciflorus. Their abundance exhibit significant seasonal and vertical variations (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Zooplankton community structure of Lake Shala has changed over time, benthic harpacticoids (Nitocra lacustris) have become replaced by small-bodied and generalist-feeder rotifers (genus Brachionus). Such ecological shifts may be driven mainly by partial atelomixis in this deep tropical lake. Overall, zooplankton species distribution and abundance are influenced by various environmental factors such as conductivity, salinity, Chl-a and nutrients. This study concludes that the composition and community structure of zooplankton in Lake Shala has changed over time with the change in physicochemical and internal limnological dynamics (atelomix).

Assessment of trace metals in water samples and tissues of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) from the Akaki River Catchment and the Aba Samuel Reservoir, central Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in water and muscle of Clarias gariepinus from the Akaki River Catchment and the Aba Samuel Reservoir in Ethiopia during 2016 and 2017. The analyses were performed using ICP-OES. The results revealed that both the catchment area and the reservoir are affected by a high influx of trace metals. From measured values/permissible limits of Cr (0.101/0.05 mg ml(-1)), Fe (1.47/0.2 mg ml(-1)), Mn (1.06/0.05 mg ml(-1)) and Ni (0.06/0.02 mg ml(-1)) in water samples and Cr (10.66/1 mg kg(-1)), Fe (66.48/43 mg kg(-1)), Mn (2.28/1 mg kg(-1)), Ni (4.93/1 mg kg(-1)) and Pb (2.79/1 mg kg(-1)) in the muscle of C. gariepinus, it is clear that values of these trace metals were above the permissible limits.

In this paper, N2O saturations were examined in the ecologically heterogeneous, eutrophied, Lake Taihu, as well as in surrounding rivers in eastern China. The emissions of N2O were estimated and compared with those from other landscapes within the Lake Taihu drainage basin. We found that anthropogenically-enhanced inorganic N inputs act as a limited primary control on the spatial distribution of N2O saturations in heavily eutrophied parts of the lake only and that overall, lake N2O production and emission are not raised as significantly as expected due to high N inputs. In comparison, the heavily eutrophied river network is an important fraction of the local N2O budget, and when considered together with emissions of N2O from the lake, constitute a major (10-50% depending on season) fraction of total N2O emissions from the Lake Taihu drainage basin.

Panjiakou, Daheiting, Qiuzhuang, and the Douhe Reservoirs located from top to bottom in the LuanHe River region forming a group of cascade reservoirs. After over 30 years of aquaculture, the concentration of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have exceeded Class III of Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water in China. We selected the Douhe Reservoir as the study site and choose sampling points in several upstream reservoirs and main reservoir area, and we collected a total of 18 water samples. Moreover, the distribution characteristics of N and P levels in flood season and dry season were studied in the Douhe Reservoir and upstream water channel, respectively. The results indicated that there were significant spatial differences between N and P distribution in the Douhe Reservoir and the upstream sites. We observed that the distribution of N and P had seasonal characteristics, and the contents of nitrate(NO3(-)-N), nitrogen(TN), total phosphorus(TP), and total dissolved phosphorus(TDP) in flood periods were higher than those in dry periods. The microbial community structure illustrated that the dominant phylum displayed seasonal differences between the upstream channel and the reservoir area. Among them, the abundance of some genera changed with the location of the channel, the microbial community structure, and the levels of N and P, especially in flood season. Particularly, NO3--N and TN had the most significant correlation. Hence, this study presented an important theoretical foundation for the risk prevention and the control of nutrient elements in the LuanHe River basin in the future, which would enhance the drinking water safety of Tianjin and Tangshan residents.					; Chang, Sheng/G-9689-2011	CHANG, SHENG/0000-0003-1576-3505; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				2022 MAR 1	2022										10.1007/s11356-022-19273-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19273-0		MAR 2022						35233670					WOS:000762905200009

The results showed that BCS-VSFCW overcame the adverse effects of low temperature and achieved the deep removal of nutrients. In addition, the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) by BCS-VSFCW were 38.65%, 28.20%, 18.82%, and 14.57% higher than those of blank control, respectively. During the experiment, Oenanthe javanica and low temperature tolerant Bacillus complemented each other in terms of microbial activity and plant uptake. Therefore, VSFCW combined with Oenanthe javanica and low temperature tolerant Bacillus has a promising future in low temperature (<10 degrees C) areas of northern China.

Geochemical modelling can help to identify present-days processes and to quantify formation rates if the system is sufficiently constrained. Here we used the PHREEQC model for this purpose, applying it to soil alkaline to acidic soil systems in the Nhecolandia area. A large amount of data was available, but scientific questions remained opened. We carried out a complementary field study to clarify a key point necessary for modelling, confirming the disconnection between two types of groundwater, perched, alkaline and deep, acidic. Our simulations showed that the observed soil system corresponds to the current biogeochemistry and that paleoclimatic genetic hypotheses are unnecessary. We found that the ridge soil formation rate ranges from 396 to 638 kg ha-1 y-1, depending on hypotheses. We showed that the downslope soils act as buffers to store labile species during the dry season, allowing alkalinity to be maintained from one year to the next. At least 125 y were necessary to obtain downslope alkaline lakes, and this alkaline nature can quickly disappear after changing drainage conditions. We explained how hyperacidic horizons (pH < 4) can neighbor alkaline horizons (pH > 10) with a sharp contact. When correctly informed, geochemical modelling appeared as an effective tool to answer questions about soil processes.

Mapping and Monitoring the Akagera Wetland in Rwanda	SUSTAINABILITY												Wetland maps are a prerequisite for wetland development planning, protection, and restoration. The present study aimed at mapping and monitoring Rwanda's Akagera Complex Wetland by means of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Landsat data, spanning from 1987 to 2015, were acquired from different sensor instruments, considering a 5-year interval during the dry season and the shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (30-m resolution) was used to delineate the wetland. The mapping and delineation results showed that the wetland narrowly extends along the Rwanda-Tanzania border from north to south, following the course of Akagera River and the total area can be estimated at 100,229.76 ha. After waterbodies that occupy 30% of the wetland's surface area, hippo grass and Cyperus papyrus are also predominant, representing 29.8% and 29%, respectively. Floodplain and swamp forest have also been inventoried in smaller proportions. While the wetland extent has apparently remained stable, the inhabiting waterbodies have been subject to enormous instability due to invasive species. Lakes, such as Mihindi, Ihema, Hago and Kivumba have been shrinking in extent, while Lake Rwanyakizinga has experienced a certain degree of expansion. This study represents a consistent decision support tool for Akagera wetland management in Rwanda.					; Guo, Hao/M-1304-2017	Bao, Anming/0000-0002-6221-7403; Guo, Hao/0000-0003-0036-8879; KARAMAGE, Fidele/0000-0002-5216-3704														2071-1050				FEB	2017	9	2							174	10.3390/su9020174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9020174													WOS:000395590500016

To further understand the spatial heterogeneity along an aquatic continuum from the upriver to wetland to lake to downriver, the study was conducted on spatial variations in N2O emission along Poyang Lake aquatic continuum during the flood season from 15 July 2013 to 10 August 2013. The results showed the N2O concentrations, the ratio of N2O/dinitrogen (N-2) gases production, N2O emission and denitrification rates ranged from 0.10 to 1.11 mu g N/L, -0.007% to 0.051%, -9.73 to 127 mu g N/m(2)/hr and 1.33 x 10(4) to 31.9 x 10(4) mu g N-2/m(2)/hr, respectively, across the continuum. The average N2O concentrations, the ratio of N2O/N-2 and N2O emission was significantly lower in wetlands as compared to the rivers and lake (p < 0.01). The significantly high denitrification rate and low N2O emission together highlighted that most N2O can be converted into N-2 via near complete denitrification in the Poyang Lake wetlands. Our study suggests that the wetlands might impact N2O budget in an integrated aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, N2O emission from different aquatic ecosystem should be considered separately when quantifying the regional budget in aquatic ecosystem.

Previous studies lack a correct representation of the seasonal vegetation phenology associated with urban expansion, and therefore it is difficult to accurately describe the land-atmosphere coupling. In this study, high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations are used to describe the changes in land surface characteristics, including land-cover type, green vegetation fraction, and leaf area index with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. The use of MODIS satellite observations provides a clear improvement in model performance when compared with ground-based measurements. Atypical urban heat island is generated around Shanghai, Wuxi-Suzhou-Yangzhou, and cities along the Yangtze River and Hangzhou Bay, which subsequently modifies the local thermal circulations. The sea breeze is significantly enhanced over the north bank of Hangzhou Bay because of the increased land-sea temperature contrast. Several surface convergent zones are generated along the Shanghai-Suzhou-Wuxi city belt as a result of the combined effects of the urban heat island, the enhanced sea breeze, and the lake breeze at Lake Tai.

Dormant eggs (ephippia) are produced when environmental conditions deteriorate, and Daphnia switch from clonal to sexual reproduction. Ephippia produced over different growing seasons can accumulate in the sediment of ponds and lakes, where they can be exposed to pesticides and other (anthropogenic) stressors. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of pesticide exposure on dormant eggs at different embryonic developmental stages and evaluated the degree of protection against pollution provided by the ephippial case. We therefore conducted a hatching experiment in which decapsulated and encapsulated dormant eggs were exposed to an insect growth regulator (fenoxycarb) at different stages during their development, both before and after activation of the eggs. In addition, we developed an analytical method to measure fenoxycarb concentrations in the dormant eggs. Fenoxycarb negatively affected development and hatching success and changed the timing of hatching in activated and in dormant eggs. Hatching characteristics as well as fenoxycarb concentrations inside the eggs differed significantly between exposure treatments. Final stages of embryonic development were most sensitive to pesticide exposure and had the highest tissue concentrations of fenoxycarb. Tissue concentrations did not differ significantly between decapsulated and encapsulated eggs, suggesting that the ephippial case offers limited or no direct protection against pesticide exposure. With this study we provide new evidence showing that pesticides can bioconcentrate in and affect D. magna dormant eggs. The severity of the effects on developing embryos depends on the timing of pesticide exposure. Our results stress the importance of considering the full life-cycle of model organisms used in ecotoxicological studies, since these are ultimately aimed at assessing risks of chemical exposure on natural aquatic ecosystems.

Estimation of cyanobacterial pigments in a freshwater lake using OCM satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacteria represent a major harmful algal group in fresh to brackish water environments. Lac des Allemands, a freshwater lake of 49 km(2) southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana on the upper end of the Barataria Estuary, provides a natural laboratory for remote characterization of cyanobacterial blooms because of their seasonal occurrence. The Oceansat-1 satellite Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) provides measurements similar to SeaWiFS but with higher spatial resolution, and this work is the first attempt to use OCM measurements to quantify cyanobacterial pigments. The satellite signal was first vicariously calibrated using SeaWiFS as a reference, and then corrected to remove the atmospheric effects using a customized atmospheric correction procedure. Then, empirical inversion algorithms were developed to convert the OCM remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at bands 4 and 5 (centered at 510.6 and 556.4 nm, respectively) to concentrations of phycocyanin (PC), the primary cyanobacterial pigment. A holistic approach was used to minimize the influence of other optically active constituents on the PC algorithm. Similarly, empirical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were developed using OCM bands 5 and 6 (centered at 556.4 and 669 nm, respectively). The best PC algorithm (R-2 = 0.7450, p < 0.0001, n = 72) yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 36.92 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 10.27% (PC from 2.75 to 363.50 mu g/L, n = 48). The best algorithm for Chl a (R-2 = 0.7510, p < 0.0001, n = 72) produced an RMSE of 31.19 mu g/L with a relative RMSE of 16.56% (Chl a from 9.46 to 212.76 mu g/L, n = 48). While more field data are required to further validate the long-term performance of these algorithms, currently they represent the best protocol for establishing a long time-series of cyanobacterial blooms in the Lac des Allemands using OCM data.

J	Hulley, GC; Hook, SJ; Schneider, P				Hulley, Glynn C.; Hook, Simon J.; Schneider, Philipp			Optimized split-window coefficients for deriving surface temperatures from inland water bodies	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Large inland water bodies constituting lakes, reservoirs and inland-seas are excellent proxy indicators for climate change. Using thermal infrared satellite data, a recent study found that a global set of inland water bodies showed significant warming in seasonal nighttime lake Surface Water Temperatures (LSWTs) between 1985 and 2009. Split-window land surface temperature (LST) retrievals are typically tuned for a broad range of land surface emissivities and global atmospheric conditions, and are not optimized for inland water body surfaces, whereas split-window sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are only tuned for a single emissivity (water), but over ocean atmospheres. Over inland water bodies, these two approaches can lead to region dependent errors in LSWTs, spurious trends, and inconsistencies between sensors in the long-term temperature record of inland water bodies. To address this issue, the primary goal of this paper was to develop a methodology for deriving a set of optimized split-window coefficients, individually tuned for the regional atmospheric conditions of 169 globally distributed, saline and freshwater inland water bodies from multiple satellite sensors including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua; Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) including ATSR-1, ATSR-2, AATSR; and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR-3). The new Inland Water-body Surface Temperature (IWbST) v1.0 algorithm was applied to Terra MODIS and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data and validated with in situ water temperature data from sites with widely contrasting atmospheric conditions: Lake Tahoe in California/Nevada, a high-elevation cool and dry site, and the Salton Sea in California, a low-elevation warm and humid site. Analysis showed improved accuracy in LSWTs in terms of bias and RMSE when compared to the standard MODIS LST and AATSR SST products. For example, the IWbST RMSE at Salton Sea was reduced by 0.4 K when compared to the operational MODIS product. For the AATSR data, the IWbST RMSE was reduced by 036 K at Tahoe and 0.29 K at Salton Sea when compared to results obtained using the operational AATSR split-window coefficients. The IWbST improvements are significant in relation to the current accuracy of water temperature retrievals from space (<0.5 K), and will enable the derivation of long-term, accurate LSWFs consistently across multiple sensors for climate studies.

Here, we quantified trends in the spatial extent of smoke cover in California, USA, and assessed responses of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration to smoke in 10 lakes spanning a gradient in water clarity and nutrient concentrations. From 2006 - 2022, the maximum extent of medium or high-density smoke occurring between June-October increased by 300,000 km2. In the three smokiest years (2018, 2020, 2021), lakes experienced 23 - 45 medium or high-density smoke days, characterized by 20% lower shortwave radiation fluxes and five-fold higher atmospheric fine particulate matter concentrations. Ecosystem respiration generally declined during smoke cover, especially in low-nutrient, cold lakes, whereas responses of primary production were more variable. Lake attributes and seasonal timing of wildfires will mediate the effects of smoke on lakes. Wildfire smoke reduced shortwave radiation fluxes and rates of primary production and ecosystem respiration in lakes, though responses varied among lake types, according to metabolic rates in lakes estimated from hourly dissolved oxygen data.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Scordo, Facundo/LSL-2910-2024; Culpepper, Joshua/ITV-3885-2023; tang, minmeng/GQP-5520-2022	Farruggia, Mary/0000-0003-4234-6678; Culpepper, Joshua/0000-0002-0468-0539; Smits, Adrianne/0000-0001-9967-5419; Scordo, Facundo/0000-0001-6182-7368; Chandra, Sudeep/0000-0003-1724-5154; Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; 														2662-4435				MAY 22	2024	5	1							265	10.1038/s43247-024-01404-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01404-9													WOS:001229419800002

Cenotes (sinkholes) and coastal caves have been shown to record the paleohydrology of the aquifer, but there is little information on sedimentation in these cave systems and its response to climate change. Newly developed mu XRF instrumentation for the analysis of cores can achieve subannual resolution due to small measurement increments, but short period studies examining weathering inputs and rainfall have not yet been undertaken, hindering paleoenvironmental interpretations of lake and cave sediment records. This study examines the spatial and temporal relationship of cave sediment geochemistry in the anchialine cave system of Yax Chen (Quintana Roo, Mexico). Sediment traps (n = 51) were placed at seventeen stations along the 2.7 km flooded cave system, which transitions from mangrove to upland forest terrain, with cenotes of variable size and frequency along its length. Sediment traps were collected every similar to 6 months from May 2013 May 2017 along with rainfall and groundwater level data. There are distinct responses of lithogenic (Fe, Ti, Sr - limestone weathering) and biogenic influenced (Si, K, S - phytoplankton and mangrove sediment) elements in the sediment samples associated with seasonal rainfall and hurricanes. While lithogenic elements (Ti/K) show a direct relationship seasonal rainfall, the sedimentation of biologically influenced (Si/Ti) elements exhibit a 6-12 month lagged response with large rainfalls such as Hurricane Ingrid in 2013 and other tropical storms throughout the study period.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 15	2019	534								109289	10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109289													WOS:000504504200008

In this work, dissolved and labile Pb was determined by both high resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) in sediment-water profiles of the hyper-eutrophic Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu on a monthly basis during one year. The drinking water standards for dissolved Pb of the World Health Organization (10 mu g/L) and those of China were exceeded in the overlying water (20.79-118.5 mu g/L). Out of which, a total of five months even exceeded the fisheries water quality limitation (50 mu g/L) in China. The algal blooms created an anaerobic environment in the surface sediments in July. The reductive conditions led to the dissolution of Fe/Mn and this caused the release of Pb, followed by organic matter complexation. This was supported by the coincident changes of dissolved Pb with dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediments under anaerobic incubation. Algae residue decomposition in October caused another distinct release of Pb, but this process should be considerably suppressed by increased sulfide precipitation and pyrite adsorption of Pb ion. These results indicated that Pb mobilization in sediments can be significantly enhanced by algal blooms in eutrophic lakes, indicating that further attention should be paid to Pb pollution in waters with harmful algal blooms.

J	Fadum, JM; Hall, EK				Fadum, Jemma M.; Hall, Ed K.			Nitrogen is unlikely to consistently limit primary productivity in most tropical lakes	ECOSPHERE												Despite mounting evidence that tropical lakes may experience an array of phytoplankton nutrient limitation regimes, references to low-latitude lakes being predominantly nitrogen limited remain common in the literature. To assess the current understanding of nutrient limitation regimes in tropical lakes, we performed a literature review with the following objectives: First, quantify and summarize observations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and colimitation in the collected studies. Second, identify common drivers of tropical nutrient limitation regimes. Third, provide literature-informed recommendations for future research efforts into nutrient limitation of tropical lakes. We report that not only is N not the dominant limiting nutrient in the reviewed lakes, but tropical lakes exhibit a wide range of nutrient limitation regimes, and there is often considerable heterogeneity of the dominant limiting nutrient within an individual lake. This heterogeneity is driven largely by seasonal patterns of water column stratification and precipitation, land use and land cover (LULC), and the interaction of these system characteristics with lake morphology. To accurately characterize nutrient limitation in tropical aquatic ecosystems, assessments need to include sampling across space and time in order to capture within-lake spatial heterogeneity and both inter- and intra-annual temporal variation. Whenever possible, both inferential and experimental approaches should be used in concert to determine nutrient limitation due to methodological limitations.

This review gives an insight into the present state of knowledge on the taxonomy, dynamics, toxic effects, human and ecological health implications of cyanobacteria, algal blooms and cyanotoxins in the East African Community lakes. The major toxigenic microalgae in East African lakes include Microcystis, Arthrospira, Dolichospermum, Planktolyngbya and Anabaenopsis species. Anatoxin-a, homoanatoxin-a, microcystins (MCs), cylindrospermopsin and nodularin have been quantified in water from below method detection limits to 81 mu g L-1, with peak concentrations characteristically reported for the wet season. In whole fish, gut, liver and muscles, MCs have been found at concentrations of 2.4 to 1479.24 mu g kg(-1), which can pose human health risks to a daily consumer. While there have been no reported cases of cyanotoxin-related poisoning in humans, MCs and anatoxin-a (up to 0.0514 mu g kg(-1)) have been identified as the proximal cause of indiscriminate fish kills and epornitic mortality of algivorous Phoeniconaias minor (lesser flamingos). With the unequivocal increase in climate change and variability, algal blooms and cyanotoxins will increase in frequency and severity, and this will necessitate swift action towards the mitigation of nutrient-rich pollutants loading into lakes in the region.					; Omara, Timothy/AAD-9009-2019; OMARA, TIMOTHY/AAD-9009-2019; Matovu, Henry/AAJ-2614-2020	Bohmdorfer, Stefan/0000-0003-1400-3395; Omara, Timothy/0000-0002-0175-1055; Christine Mugumya, kyarimpa/0000-0002-5180-5605; Matovu, Henry/0000-0003-0503-5416; Odongo, Silver/0000-0002-4978-3953; 														2673-9410				MAR	2023	3	1					147	167		10.3390/phycology3010010	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/phycology3010010													WOS:001318827400001

In this study, we combined hydrogeochemical, multivariate statistical, and spatial interpolation methods to assess spatial and temporal variations of lake and groundwater chemistry in Hulun Lake during the frozen and non-frozen periods. The results show that sodium (Na+) is the most abundant cation in the Hulun Lake area. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) and sulfate (SO42-) are the most predominant anions in the lake, river, and ground water during both seasons. The higher Na+ + K+ concentrations in the frozen season were related to longer circulation time and lower renewable rate. The water chemistry of the lake was of the HCO3-SO4-Cl-Na type and that of groundwater in the east and west regions was of the SO4-Cl-Na and HCO3-Na types, respectively. The chemical compositions of groundwater in the non-frozen season were mainly affected by evaporation and concentration, while rock weathering, evaporation, and human activities jointly controlled groundwater chemical component in the frozen period. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods, Ca2+, NO3-, and SO42- were identified as the main controlling indicators of the chemical characteristics of groundwater and lake water. The increase of Ca2+ concentration in the center of the lake was related to groundwater discharge along the marginal tectonic fracture zone along the lake shores, which was the potential groundwater discharge area. The unconsolidated aquifer provides recharge channels for groundwater on the eastern side, which has a certain influence on the increase of nutrient concentration (NO3-) in the lake on the eastern shore. This research adds to our rough understanding of the lake-groundwater interaction in Hulun Lake, and provides a scientific foundation for the sustainable use of water resources, as well as the eco-logical integrity preservation in cold and arid regions.

J	Chen, CY				Chen, Chen-Yuan			RETRACTED: A critical review of internal wave dynamics. Part 1-Remote sensing and in-situ observations (Retracted Article)	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL												The most important problem related to internal wave observation is that it is difficult to obtain clear results with in-situ observations. There are many factors, including the topography, time, season, wind and temperature, which may affect the shape of the wave, perhaps even making it disappear or not leave strong evidence. This paper discusses the research on in-situ observations of such waves in oceans, estuaries and lakes. Over the past decades, researchers have observed this phenomenon and have carried out numerical experiments about these internal solitary waves. They have used high tech equipment and mathematical methods to detect and calculate the results of wave vibration and simulate the in-situ conditions seen during wave turbulence. We focus on the in-situ observation of such waves in oceans, estuaries and lakes, surveying scholarly work over the past few years from a wide variety of places including Europe, the United States, South Africa, Taiwan, the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea. Even now, with the rapid development of new technology for use in in-situ observations, there are still many elements of the behavior of such waves that remain to be solved.																			1077-5463	1741-2986				MAR	2012	18	3					417	436		10.1177/1077546310395971	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077546310395971													WOS:000299962200009

Home Range Size and Seasonal Movement of Juvenile Lake Sturgeon in a Large River in the Hudson Bay Drainage Basin	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Development of rehabilitation strategies and accurate assessment of anthropogenic impacts relies on a thorough understanding of a species' life history. In the case of the lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, a better understanding of the juvenile life history stages is needed to improve conservation efforts for this imperiled species. Home range size and seasonal movement of juvenile lake sturgeon in the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, were examined using mark-recapture and acoustic telemetry. Over a 30-month period (May 2006-October 2008), 5,671 juvenile lake sturgeon (213-879 mm fork length [FL]) were marked with Floy tags and the movements of 23 juvenile lake sturgeon (364505 mm FL) were monitored by means of acoustic transmitters. Despite the potential for movement over 49 km of naturally connected riverine habitat, the results indicated that juvenile lake sturgeon exhibited strong site fidelity. As determined from the mark-recapture data set, 90.8% of recaptured fish were recaptured less than 2.0 river kilometers (rkm) from their original capture location. Similarly, acoustic telemetry data indicated that 50% of the tagged fish moved 1.5 rkm or less from their initial release locations. Finally, the results of both methodologies indicated that juvenile lake sturgeon rarely move through rapids characterized by high water velocities (>1.5 m/s), complex turbulent flows, boulder and bedrock substrates, and various cross-sectional water depths ranging from 1.0 m to approximately 15.0 m in either an upstream or downstream direction. These results suggest that the year-round habitat requirements for juvenile lake sturgeon can be met in relatively short sections of a large river. Furthermore, owing to strong site fidelity and a lack of movement through rapids, macroscale habitat use in juvenile lake sturgeon occupying large rivers may be dependent on dispersal at either the larval or young of the year life history stages.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2011	140	6					1629	1641		10.1080/00028487.2011.641881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.641881													WOS:000301153700017

Spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton and primary production in Lake Tanganyika using a MODIS based bio-optical time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tanganyika, the second largest freshwater ecosystem in Africa, is characterised by a significant heterogeneity in phytoplankton concentration linked to its particular hydrodynamics. To gather a proper understanding of primary production, it is necessary to consider spatial and temporal dynamics throughout the lake. In the present work, daily MODIS-AQUA satellite measurements were used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490) for surface waters. The spatial regionalisation of Lake Tanganyika, based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions of the chlorophyll-a dataset (July 2002-November 2005), allowed for the separation of the lake in 11 spatially coherent and co-varying regions, with 2 delocalised coastal regions. Temporal patterns of chlorophyll-a showed significant differences between regions. Estimation of the daily primary production in each region indicates that the dry season is more productive than the wet season in all regions with few exceptions. Whole-lake daily primary productivity calculated on an annual basis (2003) was 646 +/- 142mgCm(-2)day(-1). Comparing our estimation to previous studies, photosynthetic production in Lake Tanganyika appears to be presently lower (about 15%), which is consistent with other studies which used phytoplankton biovolume and changes of delta C-13 in the lake sediments. The decrease in lake productivity in recent decades may be associated to changes in climate conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Istvánovics, V; Honti, M				Istvanovics, Vera; Honti, Mark			Stochastic simulation of phytoplankton biomass using eighteen years of daily data - predictability of phytoplankton growth in a large, shallow lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												During the past decades, on-line monitoring of freshwater lakes has developed rapidly. To use high frequency time-series in lake management, novel models are needed that are simple and provide insight into the complexity of phytoplankton dynamics. Chlorophyll a (Chl), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and environmental drivers were monitored on-line in large, shallow Lake Balaton during the vegetation periods between 2001 and 2018. Growth and non-growth (G and non-G) states of algae were deduced from daily change in Chl. Random forests (RF) were used to find stochastic response rules of phytoplankton to growth-supporting environmental habitat templates. The stochastic G/non-G state was translated into long-term daily biomass dynamics by a deterministic biomass model to assess uncertainty and to distinguish between inevitable and unpredictable blooms. A biomass peak was qualified as inevitable or unpredictable if the lower 95% confidence limit of simulations exceeded or remained at the baseline Chl level, respectively. Compared to a stochastic null model based on monthly Markovian transition probabilities, RF-based models captured wax and wane of biomass realistically. Timing of peaks could be better simulated than their magnitude, likely because habitat templates were primarily determined by light whereas peak sizes might depend on unmeasured processes, such as phosphorus availability. In general, algal growth was favored by wind-induced sediment resuspension that decreased light availability but simultaneously enhanced the P supply. Seasonal temperature and an integral of departures from the "normal" seasonal temperature over 2 to 3 generations were important drivers of phytoplankton growth, whereas short-term (did and day to day) changes in water temperature appeared to be irrelevant. Four types of years could be distinguished during the study period with respect to a Igal growth conditions. The present modeling approach can reasonably be used even in highly variable aquatic environments when 3 to 4 years of daily data are available. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Data for 10 parameters at eight sites of the Tongzhou Section of the Beiyun River (TSBR) are analyzed. Hierarchical cluster analysis, fuzzy comprehensive assessment, discriminant analysis and Spearman's correlation analysis were used to estimate the water situation of each cluster and analyze its spatial-temporal variations. Principal component analysis/factor analysis were applied to extract and recognize the sources responsible for water-quality variations. The results showed that temporal variation is greater than spatial and sewage discharge is the dominant factor of the seasonal distribution. Moreover, during the rapid-flow period, water quality is polluted by a combination of organic matter, phosphorus, bio-chemical pollutants and nitrogen; during the gentle-flow period, water quality is influenced by domestic and industrial waste, the activities of algae, aquatic plants and phosphorus pollution. In regard to future improvement of water quality in TSBR, the control of reclaimed wastewater from adjacent factories should first be put in place, as well as other techniques, for example, an increase of the impervious area, low-impact development, and integrated management practices should also be proposed in managing storm water runoff.					ren, bo/IST-0814-2023															2073-4441				OCT	2018	10	10							1446	10.3390/w10101446	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10101446													WOS:000451208400161

A case study from the Neolithic settlements of Lake Chalain (Jura, France)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Charcoal fragments from the Neolithic settlements of Lake Chalain (Jura Mountains, France) were characterized by dendro-anthracology (charcoal-pith distance, tree-ring width, earlywood/latewood proportion) and ring-scale isotope geochemistry (C-13) to assess the relevance of this combined approach for paleoclimate reconstructions. Two differing climatic periods were investigated: (i) a climatic deterioration period characterized by cool and moist conditions and (ii) a climatic improvement period characterized by slightly less precipitation and warmer temperature. Latewood proportion in charcoal tree-rings was similar for the two studied climatic periods. However, the charcoal tree-rings exhibited width and C-13-content significantly different between the two studied periods, in agreement with previously inferred climatic difference. Monitoring ring-to-ring C-13 variation within each charcoal fragment revealed no noticeable climatic trend, for none of the studied periods. However, calculation of the difference in C-13-content between earlywood and latewood of a given tree-ring suggested that the cool and moist climatic period also corresponded to higher seasonal contrast than the dryer climatic period. Although this exploratory study needs further confirmation, it opens promising developments for paleoclimatic reconstructions based on the stable carbon isotope composition of archeological charcoals: the potential for recording subtle paleoclimatic variations and seasonal contrasts.

Changes in the physicochemical and biological characteristics in the lentic and lotic waters of the Nile river	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												This study aims to compare the changes in the physicochemical and biological characteristics simultaneously in Nasser Lake as lentic water and the main Nile River as lotic water due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Therefore, water samples were seasonally collected from four sites along the lentic water and five sites along the lotic water. The results showed an increase in the water temperature and pH in the lentic than the lotic waters, while TSS, nutrients, BOD, and TDS showed a reverse trend. Furthermore, zooplankton recorded 45 taxa; 31 rotifers, 7 cladocerans, and 3 copepods, in addition to 4 taxa represented in rare groups. Rotifera dominated the main river water, while Copepoda dominated Nasser Lake water. Twenty-two holozooplankters appeared only in the main river water, while three holozooplankters appeared in the lake water and 20 holozooplankters were shared in both waterbodies. The appearance of Ptygura libera in the river for the first time proved that the lake is the source of some zooplankters in the river. According to the trophic state index and the river pollution index calculations, the two waterbodies categorized as eutrophic and unpolluted, respectively.

Increased size and relative abundance of migratory fishes observed near the Athabasca oil sands	FACETS												Responses to chemical and physical stressors are commonly expected among organisms residing near the Athabasca oil sands. Physiological effects have been observed in fishes during field studies; but further effects associated with development are not clear or consistent among species. For instance, data from a fish fence in 2009 show declines in the relative abundances of some species, including Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). In contrast, increases were seen in white sucker (Catostomus commersoni). This divergence suggests incomplete understanding of the status of fishes residing near the oil sands. However, an important challenge limiting understanding is the lack of reliable baseline or reference data. To overcome this challenge, we used iterative normal ranges and a historical data set (electrofishing surveys done from 1987 to 2014) to determine if changes have occurred in fishes captured in the lower Athabasca River. These analyses revealed clear increases in the lengths of white sucker and walleye (Sander vitreus) and their relative abundances during the spawning season. The occurrence of these changes may be associated with overwintering location, but reduced fishing pressure in Lake Athabasca, eutrophication, or a cumulative effect may explain the form of changes detected in this study.

Landform and sediment imprints of fast glacier flow in the southwest Laurentide Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Evidence for former fast glacier flow (ice streaming) in the southwest Laurentide Ice Sheet is identified on the basis of regional glacial geomorphology and sedimentology, highlighting the depositional processes associated with the margin of a terrestrial terminating ice stream. Preliminary mapping from a digital elevation model of Alberta identifies corridors of smoothed topography and corridor-parallel streamlined landforms (megaflutes to mega-lineations) that display high levels of Spatial coherency. Ridges that lie transverse to the dominant streamlining patterns are interpreted as: (a) series of minor recessional push moraines; (b) thrust block moraines or composite ridges/hill-hole pairs constructed during readvances/surges; and (c) overridden moraines (cupola hills), apparently of thrust origin. Together these landforms demarcate the beds and margins of former fast ice flow trunks or ice streams that terminated as lobate forms. Localised cross-cutting and/or misalignment of flow sets indicates temporal separation and the overprinting of ice streams/lobes. The fast-flow tracks are Separated by areas of interlobate or inter-stream terrain in which moraines have been constructed at the margins of neighbouring (competing) ice streams/outlet glaciers; this inter-stream terrain was covered by more sluggish, non-streaming ice during full glacial conditions. Thin tills at the centres of the fast-flow corridors, in many places unconformably overlying stratified sediments, suggest that widespread till deformation may have been subordinate to basal sliding in driving fast ice flow but the general thickening of tills towards the lobate terminal margins of ice streams/outlet glaciers is consistent with subglacial deformation theory. In this area of relatively low relief we speculate that fast glacier flow or streaming was highly dynamic and transitory, sometimes with fast-flowing trunks topographically fixed in their onset zones and with the terminus migrating laterally. The occurrence of minor push moraines and flutings and associated landforms, because of their similarity to modern active temperate glacial landsystems, are interpreted as indicative of ice lobe marginal oscillations, possibly in response to seasonal climatic forcing, in locations where meltwater was more effectively drained from the glacier bed. Further north, the occurrence of surging glacier landsystems suggests that persistent fast glacier flow gave way to more transitory surging, possibly in response to the decreasing Size of ice reservoir areas in dispersal centres and also locally facilitated by ice-bed decoupling and drawdown initiated by the development of ice-dammed lakes.

Previous studies have documented other taxa in blooms capable of producing other cyanotoxins. Furthermore, benthic cyanobacteria have historically been overlooked in Lake Erie. Saxitoxin is a cyanotoxin of emerging concern in freshwater, and the sxtA gene which encodes its production has been found in the Maumee River and central basin of Lake Erie. Collectively, these points indicated that saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria may also occur in the western basin. We utilized three sources of data to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of potential saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria in the water column (years 2018-2022) and deployed nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) to determine the impact of nutrients, depth, and season on potentialSTX producing benthic cyanobacteria (years 2018 & 2019). The water column datasets showed that "hotspots" of sxtA lasted only a few weeks. sxtA gene copies per mL did not correlate with Dolichospermum or Aphanizomenon biovolume, which have been associated with sxtA elsewhere. In the NDS, saxitoxin (ng/cm2) and cyanobacteria chlorophyll were inversely correlated with the highest saxitoxin in September and at the deeper depth, whereas cyanobacteria chlorophyll was highest during June and at the shallower depth. This research suggests continued monitoring is needed to determine drivers of saxitoxin in the western basin, and we recommend that future Lake Erie cyanobacteria research should not solely focus on microcystins and planktonic blooms.

Altaf			Assessment of spongy moth infestation impacts on forest productivity and carbon loss using the Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing and eddy covariance flux data	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												Background Deciduous forests in eastern North America experienced a widespread and intense spongy moth (Lymantria dispar) infestation in 2021. This study quantified the impact of this spongy moth infestation on carbon (C) cycle in forests across the Great Lakes region in Canada, utilizing high-resolution (10 x 10 m2) Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images and eddy covariance (EC) flux data. Study results showed a significant reduction in leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) values in deciduous and mixed forests in the region in 2021.Results Remote sensing derived, growing season mean LAI values of deciduous (mixed) forests were 3.66 (3.18), 2.74 (2.64), and 3.53 (2.94) m2 m-2 in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, indicating about 24 (14)% reduction in LAI, as compared to pre- and post-infestation years. Similarly, growing season GPP values in deciduous (mixed) forests were 1338 (1208), 868 (932), and 1367 (1175) g C m-2, respectively in 2020, 2021 and 2022, showing about 35 (22)% reduction in GPP in 2021 as compared to pre- and post-infestation years. This infestation induced reduction in GPP of deciduous and mixed forests, when upscaled to whole study area (178,000 km2), resulted in 21.1 (21.4) Mt of C loss as compared to 2020 (2022), respectively. It shows the large scale of C losses caused by this infestation in Canadian Great Lakes region.Conclusions The methods developed in this study offer valuable tools to assess and quantify natural disturbance impacts on the regional C balance of forest ecosystems by integrating field observations, high-resolution remote sensing data and models. Study results will also help in developing sustainable forest management practices to achieve net-zero C emission goals through nature-based climate change solutions.

To assess different hydrodynamic conditions on the deposition of OC in sediment, the combination of elemental and stable isotope analyses was carried out in two reservoirs: the Huairou Reservoir (HR), which undergoes seasonal water level fluctuation (WLF) like natural lakes, and the Shisanling Reservoir (SR), which undergoes daily WLF for the operation of pumped storage power station. In general, OC concentration and its variation were comparable in the two reservoirs, whereas the OC distribution showed completely different features. The OC burial rate in SR was nearly two times more than in the HR, which reflect the impact of WLFs on the erosion of soil. For the relative contribution of phytoplankton-derived OC (P-OC), macrophyte-derived OC (M-OC), and terrestrial OC (T-OC) in sediment, the T-OC and M-OC in the SR were both higher than those of the HR, whereas the P-OC was markedly lower. Furthermore, the classification of nearshore and offshore sediments suggested that hydrodynamic conditions affected the T-OC import by physical processes and the in situ contributions of P-OC and M-OC with a spatial difference.

The seasonal and long-term trend of ammonia risk in ecologically significant sections of Tai Lake, China was unknown. In this study, a two-level (deterministic and quantitative) method was developed to assess the special ecological risks posed by NH3-N at 37 sites during two seasons (February and September) of 2014 in Tai Lake. The long-term temporal (2004-2015) risk posed by NH3-N was also assessed by comparing annual quantitative risk values (probability of exceeding acute or chronic threshold values) in three key sections of Tai Lake. The results indicated the species living in the Tai Lake were at a 0.04% and 32.45% chance of risk due to acute exposure, and a 1.97% and 92.05% chance of risk due to chronic exposure in February and September of 2014, respectively. Alarmingly, the chronic ecological risks of NH3-N in the Lanshanzui section of the Tai Lake remained > 30% from 2004 to 2011. The chronic risk of NH3-N in all three key sections of Tai Lake started to decrease in 2011. This was likely the consequence of the control practice of eutrophication implemented in the Tai Lake. A significant decline in diversity of the benthic invertebrate community of the Tai Lake could be associated with continuous exposure to ammonia over decades given different sensitivity of taxa to ammonia. The results laid a scientific foundation for risk assessment and management of ammonia in Tai Lake, China, and the developed two-level risk assessment approach can also be applied to other similar aquatic regions.

J	Gledhill, LA; Williamson, AG				Gledhill, Laura A.; Williamson, Andrew G.			Inland advance of supraglacial lakes in north-west Greenland under recent climatic warming	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												The inland advance of supraglacial lakes (SGLs) towards the interior regions of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) may have implications for the water volumes reaching the subglacial drainage system, and could consequently affect long-term ice-sheet dynamics. Here, we investigate changes to the areas, volumes and elevation distributions of over 8000 manually delineated SGLs using 44 Landsat images of a 6200 km(2) sector of north-west Greenland over three decades (1985-2016). Our results show that SGLs have advanced to higher maximum (+418 m) and mean (+299 m) elevations, and that there has been a near-doubling of total regional SGL areas and volumes over the study period, accelerating after 2000. These changes were primarily caused by an increased SGL area and volume at high (>= 1200 m a.s.l.) elevations, where SGL coverage increased by over 2750% during the study period. Many of the observed changes, particularly the post-2000 accelerations, were driven by changes to regional surface-temperature anomalies. This study demonstrates the past and accelerating response of the GrlS's hydrological system due to climatic warming, indicating an urgent need to understand whether the increasingly inland SGLs will be capable of hydrofracture in the future, thus determining their potential implications for ice-sheet dynamics.																			0260-3055	1727-5644				APR	2018	59	76	1				66	82		10.1017/aog.2017.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aog.2017.31													WOS:000440821000008

In this study, whole fungal communities were determined seasonally and spatially using a high-throughput sequencing technique. Water samples were collected from the epilimnion, 0-20 m depth, with a Van Dorn sampler at a pelagic site and from the surface at a littoral site in the north basin of Lake Biwa. All pelagic depth samples were combined into one sample. Sampling occurred on 24 April, 22 May, 10 July, and 16 September 2015. DNA was extracted from filtered samples. Metabarcoding analysis targeting fungi-specific internal transcribed spacer 2 regions was performed using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Epilimnetic fungal communities showed high diversity, with 479 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The OTUs included 122 belonging to the phylum Ascomycota, 127 to Basidiomycota, 38 to Zygomycota, 45 to Chytridiomycota, 2 to Glomeromycota, and 145 were unclassified fungi. Fungal community structures varied seasonally and spatially. Few of the fungal OTUs overlapped between seasons and sites, and specific communities of fungi were detected on each sampling occasion. Results indicated that spatio-temporal variations in fungal communities were high and may be influenced by both internal factors and external factors, such as terrestrial inputs.

In the present work, the soils in and around three brackish lakes that have experienced degradation (Carandazal, Cerca and Banhado lakes) were studied through a detailed morphological survey and chemical analyses to understand their genesis and establish genetic relationship with the Saline-Sodic soils of the saline lakes. The studied soils have Bnc and Bc horizons with morphological and chemical similarities to the Bnx formed around the saline lakes, presenting greenish colors, hard consistencies and, generally, the highest values of pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and electrical conductivity in the saturated paste (ECs) of each profile. to contrast, the near-surface horizons tend to present the lowest values of pH and the highest amounts of Al3+ saturation and exchangeable H + Al. These data point to the replacement of salinization/solonization around the saline lakes to the solodization process in the studied soils, with leaching of exchangeable bases, their substitution by Al3+ and H+ and a consequent decrease in pH, first at shallow depths and later in the whole profile. Solodization occurs to a lower degree in the soils associated with the Carandazal lake, which has a predominance of Solonetzes and the closest water pH and electrical conductivity (EC) to the saline lakes, and to a higher degree in the soils related to the Banhado lake, which has a predominance of Solods and the most similar water pH and EC to the freshwaters of the NhecolAndia. The Cerca lake has an intermediate water geochemistry between the studied lakes and an equal prevalence of Solodized Solonetzes and Solods. Soil leaching occurs due to increasing inundation by freshwater through erosion around the saline lakes, primarily involving formation of new intermittent watercourses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms of Sb mobility in sediments are still unclear, especially considering the interactions among Sb, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and multi-spectral techniques simultaneously investigated changes in Sb, Fe, Mn, and DOM in two different ecological types (algal and grass) sediments with increasing temperature. We found that the dissolved Sb rapidly increased with the increase in temperature. The oxidation of Sb(III) to Sb(V) by Fe/Mn oxides in oxygen (O2) rich overlying water and surface sediment layers was one of the reasons for Sb concentration enhancement in pore water. Further, using excitation-emission matrix and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC), synchronous fluorescence (SF) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) revealed that complexation with DOM was the other reasons for Sb concentration increasing in sediments. This was demonstrated by the similar distribution pattern and significant correlation between Sb and tryptophanlike components. Titration experiments further revealed that Sb was more stably bound to tryptophan-like components in the aromatic C-H (660 cm-1), alcoholic C-O (1115 cm-1), alkene C--C (1615 cm-1), and carboxylic acid OH (3390 cm-1) groups. The tryptophan-like components from the algae region had a higher binding force than that from the macrophytes region. Our study effectively promotes an understanding of Sb mobilization in lacustrine sediments.

We selected four lakes in Washington State, USA, ranging from oligo- to hypereutrophic, to study the separate and interactive effects of enhanced nutrient availability and zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton net growth rates and overall microplankton (phytoplankton and microzooplankton) assemblage structure. We collected water quality and plankton samples monthly in each lake from May to October 2014, and also conducted laboratory incubation experiments using ambient plankton assemblages from each lake with amendments of zooplankton grazers (5x ambient densities) and nutrients (Nitrogen + Phosphorus) in June, August, and October. In each set of monthly experiments, nested two-way ANOVAs were used to test the effects of enhanced grazers and nutrients on net chlorophyll a-based phytoplankton growth rates. Nested PERMANOVAs were used to test the effects of each factor on microplankton assemblage structure. Enhanced grazing reduced phytoplankton net growth in oligotrophic Cle Elum Lake and oligo-mesotrophic Lake Merwin in August (p < 0.001) and Merwin again in October (p < 0.05), while nutrient enhancement increased phytoplankton net growth in Lake Merwin in June (p < 0.01). Changes in microplankton assemblage composition were not detected as a result of either factor, but they were significantly different between sites (p < 0.001) during each month, and varied by month within each lake. Significant effects of both enhanced grazers and nutrients were detected in systems of low, but not high, trophic state, although this varied by season. We suggest that it is critical to consider trophic state when predicting the response of phytoplankton to bottom-up and top-down factors in lakes.					; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017; Zimmerman, Julie/K-9572-2013	Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720; Zimmerman, Julie/0000-0002-5392-312X; 														2073-4441				APR	2021	13	8							1085	10.3390/w13081085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13081085													WOS:000644889000001

Even though Alaska hosts 65% of U.S. wetlands, less than half of the wetlands in Alaska have been mapped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) or other high-resolution wetlands protocols. The availability of time series satellite data and the development of machine learning algorithms have enabled the characterization of Arctic wetland inundation dynamics and vegetation types with limited ground data input. In this study, we built a semi-automatic process to generate sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) maps across the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska using random forest regression and 139 Sentinel-2 images taken in ice-free seasons from 2016 to 2019. With this, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of wetland inundation and explored their potential usage in determining NWI water regimes. The highest levels of surface water expression were detected in June, resulting from seasonal active layer thaw and snowmelt. Inundation was most variable in riverbeds, lake and pond margins, and depressional wetlands, where water levels fluctuate substantially between dry and wet seasons. NWI water regimes that indicate frequent inundation, such as permanently flooded wetlands, had high SWF values (SWF >= 90%), while those with infrequent inundation, such as temporarily flooded wetlands, had low SWF values (SWF < 10%). Vegetation types were also classified through the synergistic use of a vegetation index, water regimes, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, topographic data, and a random forest classifier. The random forest classification algorithms demonstrated good performance in classifying Arctic wetland vegetation types, with an overall accuracy of 0.87. Compared with NWI data produced in the 1980s, scrub-shrub wetlands appear to have increased from 91 to 258 km(2) over the last three decades, which is the largest percentage change (182%) among all vegetation types. However, additional field data are needed to confirm this shift in vegetation type. This study demonstrates the potential of using time series satellite data and machine learning algorithms in characterizing inundation dynamics and vegetation types of Arctic wetlands. This approach could aid in the creation and maintenance of wetland inventories, including the NWI, in Arctic regions and enable an improved understanding of long-term wetland dynamics.

However, climate change, seasonal precipitation cycling, and anthropogenic activities add high variability to its availability. Thus, timely and accurate mapping of open surface water is necessary. In this study, a methodology based on the concept of spatial autocorrelation was developed for automatic water extraction from Landsat series images using Taihu Lake in south-eastern China as an example. The results show that this method has great potential to extract continuous open surface water automatically, even when the water surface is covered by floating vegetation or algal blooms. The results also indicate that the second shortwave-infrared band (SWIR2) band performs best for water extraction when water is turbid or covered by surficial vegetation. Near-infrared band (NIR), first shortwave-infrared band (SWIR1), and SWIR2 have consistent extraction success when the water surface is not covered by vegetation. Low filter image processing greatly overestimated extracted water bodies, and cloud and image salt and pepper issues have a large impact on water extraction using the methods developed in this study.					; guo, mengdan/JWO-6763-2024; Xu, Dandan/H-7261-2019	Luan, Zhaoqing/0000-0002-7648-3657; Xu, Dandan/0000-0002-0033-2262														2073-4441				JUL	2020	12	7							1928	10.3390/w12071928	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12071928													WOS:000558290900001

Our objective is to assess how lake records could be used to understand river-catchment-scale denudation and weathering processes. Total denudation rates at Lake Baikal, as obtained from meteoric Be-10/Be-9, are an order of magnitude lower than the global average, at 16-35 t km(-2) yr(-1). Chemical weathering rates obtained from the riverine dissolved load and discharge are, on the other hand, in the same range as global values, at 6-29 t km(-2) yr(-1). Chemical weathering rates are higher in the north of the catchment than in the south, consistent with higher runoff in the north. In contrast, Be-10/Be-9-derived denudation rates are higher in the south. We hypothesize that this pattern of variation may be due to the stabilizing effect of permafrost soils preventing erosion in the north. An inverse model shows that the Selenga River, Lake Baikal's major tributary, has a silicate weathering contribution to riverine dissolved cation fluxes of 42 mol%; this and other characteristics are representative of large rivers globally. Many trace elements have much lower concentrations in the lake than in inflowing rivers (Be (5%), Mn (3%), Fe (0.4%) and REE (1-2%)). We suggest, based on REE patterns and Mn, Fe-depth profiles in the lake, that this removal is the result of pH induced changes in dissolved-adsorbed partitioning at the river-lake interface, and the incorporation of trace elements into authigenic Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxide phases forming within the lake. Strontium is isotopically uniform within the lake, demonstrating that the whole lake mixes on a timescale shorter than its residence time (< 330 years). Neodymium and Be, in contrast, show isotopic variability between the basins. While the Sr isotope budget of the lake is largely consistent with observed riverine Sr fluxes, an unradiogenic Nd source is needed to explain lake Nd isotope compositions, especially in the Northern Basin. This source appears to derive from old crustal rocks in this part of the catchment and could be hydrothermal, or small rivers that were not sampled here. Similarly, elevated Be-10/Be-9 ratios in the lake basins relative to the river input imply variable but significant atmospheric inputs of Be-10 into the lake.Overall, this study demonstrates that records of the paleo-chemistry of lakes, and Lake Baikal in particular, hold promise for understanding denudation and weathering on the continents, in ways that are more directly relatable to the environmental conditions of the catchment than is possible with marine records.

In this paper, the permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technology with TerraSAR-X imagery over the area around Dongting Lake was utilized to generate the long-term spatial-temporal deformation. Since the X-band SAR interferometric phases are highly influenced by the thermal dilation of the observed objects, and the deformation of large infrastructures are highly related to external temperature, a combined deformation model considering the thermal expansion and the seasonal environmental factors was proposed to model the temporal variations of the deformation. The time series deformation and the thermal dilation parameter over the area were obtained, and a comparative study with the traditional linear model was conducted. The Dongting Lake Bridge and the typical feature points distributed around the lake were analyzed in details. In order to compensate for the unavailability of external in situ measurements over the area, phase residuals and the subsidence generated through Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) were utilized to verify the accuracy of the obtained deformation time series. Experiment results suggested that the proposed model is suitable and suggested for the selected study site. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the residual phase was estimated as 0.32 rad, and the RMSE compared with D-InSAR derived deformation was +/- 1.1 mm.

However, zebra mussels remain dominant in areas with higher water velocity. We hypothesized that the persistence of zebra over quagga mussels in habitats with higher water velocity might result from greater rate and strength of byssal thread attachment. We examined whether zebra mussels relative to quagga mussels have: (1) higher byssal thread synthesis rate, (2) lower dislodgment in flow and (3) greater mechanical force required for detachment from substrate. Specifically, we examined byssal thread synthesis rate and dislodgment of both species in response to water velocities of 0, 50, 100 and 180 cm s(-1). Byssal thread synthesis rate was significantly higher for zebra than for quagga mussels at all velocities. Dislodgment from the substrate increased for both species with increasing velocity but was significantly lower for zebra than for quagga mussels. We also tested the mechanical force to detach mussels after short (32h) and long (two and three months) periods of attachment on hard substrate. Detachment force was significantly higher for zebra than for quagga mussels only after short-term attachment. Higher byssal thread synthesis rate in zebra mussels was a likely factor that minimized their dislodgment in flow and increased short-term attachment strength. Differences in byssal thread synthesis rate between the two species might partly account for the ability of zebra mussels to maintain dominance over quagga mussels in habitats with high velocities.																			0022-0949	1477-9145				JUL 1	2009	212	13					2026	2035		10.1242/jeb.028688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.028688								19525429					WOS:000266948400017

In turn, water utilized by vegetation leads to the differential distribution of soil moisture in different dunes. However, vegetation-soil dynamics in the alpine desert of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau remain poorly understood. We chose the largest section of desert along the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake as a study area to test the hypotheses that plant community characteristics and soil physicochemical properties show differences in different sand-binding communities, in addition to soil moisture content, based on methods of field investigations and in situ observations. The main results were as follows:1) Plant community species diversity and herb coverage increased with the stabilization status of dunes; meanwhile, coverage increased with the age of the added artificial semi-fixed dunes. 2) Surface deposits were mainly composed of medium sand, leading to low organic matter and nutrient content in the study area; this being different from other deserts in northern China. 3) Soil moisture's seasonal variation was consistent with rainfall seasonality and lacked significant interannual differences, while its vertical distribution was influenced by precipitation infiltration. 4) Soil crust forms beneath specific species, such as leguminous plants in the study area, which should be effective at preventing wind erosion. Our findings will facilitate a mechanistic understanding of plant-soil-water relationships in alpine deserts and provide timely information for screening introduced species for enhancing sand-fixation effectiveness.

Surface-water/groundwater exchange in a sand dune lake in the Dry Pampean Plain, Argentina: stable isotopic evidence	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Understanding the hydrological functioning of the scarce freshwater bodies of semiarid regions is crucial, especially in those areas affected by anthropic activities involving land-use changes. In the dry western edge of the Argentina Pampean plains, a system of more than 100 shallow lakes of remarkable stability occurs. These lakes exhibit low salinity compared to those located in the more humid belt. This system has constituted the main water resource for humans from prehispanic times to the present. Stable isotopes were used to establish the seasonal surface-water/groundwater interactions and the hydrological conditions in a lake of the Dry Pampean Plain (DPP), i.e., Lake Los Pocitos, to understand the mechanism that guarantees such a resource. Results indicate that evaporation mainly controls the isotopic composition of lake water, overwhelming the effect of higher rainfall inputs during the wet (but also most evaporative) season. The delta O-18 mass balance model indicates greater groundwater inflow to the lake during the dry season (similar to 0.4 m month(-1)) compared to the wet season (similar to 0.2 m month(-1)). Lake level decreased in the wet season due to the lowest groundwater inflow and the greatest evaporation rate. Based on the proportion of water entering a lake that leaves through evaporation, Los Pocitos corresponds to a throughflow lake with a short water residence time (similar to 0.47 years). These hydrologic conditions, along with freshwater inputs from a dune located at the western margin of the lake, determine the existence of this relatively stable and freshwater lake in the DPP where high evaporation rates are registered.

Hourly sampling at a fixed depth (17.1 m) enabled study of redox changes during the transition from oxic to sulfidic conditions and vice versa. The oxidation-reduction potential, pH, conductivity and turbidity correlated linearly with the water temperature (a proxy for depth relative to the chemocline). The highest concentrations of thiosulfate and sulfite were detected approximately 2.5 m below the chemocline. Concentrations of zero-valent sulfur increased ~ 10 fold when the chemocline rose into the photic zone due to phototrophic sulfide oxidation. Triple isotopic composition of sulfur species indicates a shift with depth from values typical for sulfate reduction right below the chemocline to values which may be explained by either sulfate reduction alone or by a combination of microbial sulfate reduction and microbial sulfate disproportionation. We conclude that consumption of hydrogen sulfide at the chemocline of Lake Kinneret is controlled by the combination of its chemical and/or chemotrophic oxidation to sulfur oxoanions and predominantly phototrophic oxidation to zero-valent sulfur.

J	Yan, RH; Gao, JF; Huang, JC				Yan, Renhua; Gao, Junfeng; Huang, Jiacong			Modelling the hydrological processes of a Chinese lowland polder and identifying the key factors using an improved PHPS model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Improved hydrological processes simulation and identification of determinants are urgently needed in risk management to reduce socio-economic losses resulting from polder water problems. This paper improved the lowland Polder Hydrology and Phosphorus modelling System (called PHPS2.0) by coupling the PHPS, Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), and Integrated Catchments model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P). Then, based on the PHPS2.0 and data collected from the Jianwei polder in southeastern China, a boosted regression tree (BRT) algorithm was used to explore the key factors determining the temporal variations in polder discharge and phosphorus export. The results showed that PHPS2.0 achieved excellent agreements between the simulated and observed discharge, surface water and phosphorus. The model performance was significantly improved because field-scale phosphorus dynamics were considered. The water and phosphorus balances exhibited substantial seasonal changes, especially in terms of fertilization, crop harvest, and discharge. The temporal change in catchment discharge mainly depended on precipitation and evaporation, which accounted for 63.7% of the discharge variations. In contrast, the temporal variation in phosphorus export was determined by the crop cover and fertilizer application, which accounted for 75.4% of the phosphorus variation. To mitigate the phosphorus loss to downstream freshwater, it is recommended to remain crop residues, reduce the overuse of phosphorus chemical fertilizers, and draft emergency plans. This study expands the knowledge of the relationship between polder environmental factors and hydrological processes and provides guidance for pollution controls.

Investigation of recent decadal-scale cyclical fluctuations in salinity in the lower Colorado River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Beginning in the late 1970s, 10- to 15-year cyclical oscillations in salinity were observed at lower Colorado River monitoring sites, moving upstream from the international border with Mexico, above Imperial Dam, below Hoover Dam, and at Lees Ferry. The cause of these cyclical trends in salinity was unknown. These salinity cycles complicate the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) responsibility for managing salinity in the river for delivery of water to Mexico to meet treaty obligations. This study develops a conceptual model of the salinity cycles from time-series water quality, streamflow, and precipitation data in both the lower and upper Colorado River Basins in order to provide Reclamation the ability to understand, anticipate, and manage future salinity cycles in the lower river. Compared with the Lees Ferry record, both maximum and minimum salinity levels increase downstream by about 25% at Hoover Dam, by about 49% at Imperial Dam, and by about 69% at the northern international boundary with Mexico. In the upper basin, cyclical salinity trends are evident at the outflow of three major tributaries, where salinity is also noted to be inversely related to streamflow. Time series trends in precipitation within the catchments of the three upper basin tributaries indicate cyclical periods with above normal precipitation and periods with below normal precipitation. Periods of greater than normal precipitation in the contributing areas correspond with declines in salinity at the catchment monitoring sites and periods of less than normal precipitation correspond with rising salinity at the sites. Based on the conceptual model developed in this investigation, a multiple linear regression model was developed using a stepwise variable selection procedure to simulate salinity in Lake Powell inflow. Important variables in the explanation of salinity entering Lake Powell include flow from the three upper basin tributaries, seasonality, and mean precipitation in the upper basin, among others. The root mean square error of prediction for the MLR model was 31.48 mg/L (5.7%).																			0301-4797	1095-8630				APR 1	2019	235						442	452		10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.072								30710854					WOS:000459527800049

Evidence for Regulation of Monomethyl Mercury by Nitrate in a Seasonally Stratified, Eutrophic Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The accumulation of monomethyl mercury (CH(3)Hg(+)) in aquatic ecosystems is a redox sensitive process that is accelerated under sulfate-reducing conditions. While nitrate (NO(3)(-)) reduction is energetically favored over sulfate reduction, the influence of NO(3)(-) on the accumulation of CH(3)Hg(+) has not been reported in the literature. We examined temporal and vertical patterns in redox constituents and CH(3)Hg(+) concentrations in the hypolimnion of a dimictic lake, Onondaga Lake, prior to and following increases in NO(3)(-) inputs. Detailed water-column profiles and a long-term record revealed marked decreases in the accumulation of CH(3)Hg(+) in the anoxic hypolimnion coinciding with long-term decreases in the deposition of organic matter coupled with recent increases in NO(3)(-) concentrations. CH(3)Hg(+) concentrations in the hypolimnion were substantially abated when NO(3)(-) was present above the sediment-water interface. A decrease in the peak hypolimnetic mass of CH(3)Hg(+) and shortening of the period of elevated CH(3)Hg(+) concentrations resulted in more than a 50% decline in the accumulated CH(3)Hg(+). NO(3)(-) regulation of CH(3)Hg(+) accumulation may be a widespread phenomenon in oxygen-limited freshwater and terrestrial environments, and could have an important, not previously recognized, effect on the biogeochemistry of mercury.

From floodplain through shrubs, forest and sedges to a Sphagnum covered site, growing season CH4 production was insufficiently consumed to balance release into the atmosphere. Emission increased by soil moisture ranging 0.6-6.8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Top soils of all sites consumed CH4 including at the lowest 78 ppmv CH4 supplied, thus potentially oxidizing 17-51 nmol CH4 g(-1) dw h(-1), with highest V-max 440 nmol g(-1) dw h(-1) under Sphagnum and lowest K-m 559 nM under hummocked Carex. Nine genera and several less understood type I and type II methanotrophs were detected by the key functional gene pmoA involved in methane oxidation. Microarray signal intensities from all sites revealed Methylococcus, the affiliated Lake Washington cluster, Methylocaldum, a Japanese rice cluster, Methylosinus, Methylocystis and the affiliated Peat264 cluster. Notably enriched by site was a floodplain Methylomonas and a Methylocapsa-affiliated watershed cluster in the Sphagnum site. The climate sensitive water table was shown to be a strong controlling factor highlighting its link with the CH4 cycle in elevated wetlands.					; Dörsch, Peter/U-2572-2018	Jensen, Sigmund/0000-0003-2191-9780; Siljanen, Henri/0000-0002-3197-1438													1758-2229					JUN	2023	15	3					206	215		10.1111/1758-2229.13137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.13137		FEB 2023						36786058					WOS:000934335200001

Lipid Biomarker Record Documents Hydroclimatic Variability of the Mississippi River Basin During the Common Era	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Floods and droughts in the Mississippi River basin are perennial hazards that cause severe economic disruption. Here we develop and analyze a new lipid biomarker record from Horseshoe Lake (Illinois, USA) to evaluate the climatic conditions associated with hydroclimatic extremes that occurred in this region over the last 1,800 years. We present geochemical proxy evidence of temperature and moisture variability using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and plant leaf wax hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2(wax)) and use isotope-enabled coupled model simulations to diagnose the controls on these proxies. Our data show pronounced warming during the Medieval era (CE 1000-1,600) that corresponds to midcontinental megadroughts. Severe floods on the upper Mississippi River basin also occurred during the Medieval era and correspond to periods of enhanced warm-season moisture. Our findings imply that projected increases in temperature and warm-season precipitation could enhance both drought and flood hazards in this economically vital region. Plain Language Summary The Mississippi River basin is an economically vital region for industry and agriculture, but it is prone to disruptive flooding and drought. Here we use organic molecules preserved in a lake sediment core to reconstruct the temperature and seasonal moisture patterns of the last 1,800 years. Our reconstruction shows that the Medieval period (ca. CE 1000-1,600) was relatively warm and that warmer temperatures in this region are associated with increased frequencies of severe droughts and floods. These findings generally support climate model projections of increasing drought and flood hazard in the Mississippi River basin as a result of anthropogenic climate change.					; Giosan, Liviu/F-1809-2010	Porter, Trevor/0000-0002-5916-1998; Nusbaumer, Jesse/0000-0002-4370-3537													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2020	47	12							e2020GL087237	10.1029/2020GL087237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087237													WOS:000551464800045

The present study investigates the temporal and spatial variations of MCs in different water bodies in the Huai River Basin in China. Water samples including rivers, ponds and wells were collected every quarter during December 2008 and December 2009. MCs were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography after solid phase extraction. MCs concentrations in river samples were 0.741 +/- 0.623 mu g L-1 with maximum of 1.846 mu g L-1. MCs in pond were 0.597 +/- 0.960 mu g L-1 with maximum of 2.298 mu g L-1. MCs were also detected in 51.7% of the groundwater samples, MCs in groundwater were 0.060 +/- 0.085 mu g L-1 with maximum of 0.446 mu g L-1. MCs concentrations in groundwater did not differ significantly among different depths or towns (Wilcoxon test, p > 0.05). The average MCs in groundwater in each sampling period were 0.068 mu g L-1, 0.118 mu g L-1, 0.052 mu g L-1, 0.059 mu g L-1 and 0.020 mu g L-1. Through multi linear regression, the best fit model was built on MCs in groundwater with River B (R-2= 0.13, p < 0.05), rather than with pond water. The results suggested that MCs contamination in groundwater originated from rivers, causing potential health risk on population who drink groundwater directly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Water samples were collected at the subsurface in all sites. The following physical and chemical parameters were measured: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, total phosphorus, ortho-phosphate, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and total nitrogen and the counts of faecal coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria were carried out to characterize the aquatic environmental sampled. The yeast counts were higher in aquatic environments with the highest counts of coliform and heterotrophic bacteria. These environments receive a high influx of domestic and industrial waste. A total of 317 isolates identified in forty eight yeast species were recorded in the sites sampled and the specie Aureobasidium pullulans were found in eleven out of eighteen sites sampled and some opportunistic pathogens such as the yeast species Candida krusei were isolated only in the polluted rivers with a positive correlation with the biotic and abiotic parameters that indicate sewage contamination.					; Callisto, Marcos/O-4930-2015; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Medeiros, Adriana/IYT-3994-2023	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Callisto, Marcos/0000-0003-2341-4700; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Medeiros, Adriana/0000-0003-0140-2653													1517-8382	1678-4405				OCT-DEC	2012	43	4					1582	1594		10.1590/S1517-83822012000400043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1517-83822012000400043								24031990					WOS:000315286400043

However, the regulation of lake carbon exchange at the water-air interface by seasonal thermal structures remains unclear, especially for alpine saline lake on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Based on continuous field sampling, carbon dioxide flux (FCO2) at the water-air interface in Qinghai Lake during the ice-free period was quantitatively analyzed by thin boundary layer model, as well as the driving factors of the change in FCO2 at the water-air interface. The findings revealed that the FCO2 was -22.16 +/- 11.73 mmol m- 2d-1 during the stratification period, and - 45.32 +/- 29.67 mmol m- 2d-1 during the mixing period. We found that thermal stratification limits the matter-energy exchange between the upper and bottom water columns, and carbonate precipitation results in a higher FCO2 than during mixing stage. However, the mixing process reduces the limiting effect of thermal stratification. During the carbonate process, water with higher salinity and pH at the bottom of the water column enters the upper part of the water column, reducing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the water column and causing the absorption of CO2 by the lake. Thermal stratification affects the vertical material-energy exchange and atmospheric CO2 uptake of lake. The present study further explains the possible underlying regulation of CO 2 uptake in saline lake on the QTP involving the varied thermal structure.

Marugan			The vertebrate assemblage of Buenache de la Sierra (Upper Barremian of Serrania de Cuenca, Spain) with insights into its taphonomy and palaeoecology	CRETACEOUS RESEARCH												The Upper Barremian deposits of La Huerguina Limestone Formation in the Serrania de Cuenca (Iberian Ranges, Spain) contain rich continental fossil associations preserved under a great diversity of taphonomic conditions in alluvial and lacustrine deposits. The vertebrate association retrieved from the Buenache de la Sierra Subbasin is described in detail and compared to other localities of La Huerguina Formation (Una and Las Hoyas). The association was found at El Ingles Quarry, in a level composed of grey to ochre slabby marly siltstones, sometimes slightly sandy, with abundant plant macroremains sedimented in a small stagnant pond. The pond was part of a complex and mixed (siliciclastic and carbonatic) depositional system, controlled by a seasonal subtropical climate. It consisted of distal alluvial plains grooved by narrow channels with scattered ponds, small shallow lakes and palustrine marshy areas, fed by superficial water and groundwater. These underwent seasonal floods followed by slow draining and evaporation and finally a seasonal period of desiccation. Three different points from the same level were sampled in the quarry. Microfossils were extracted with a sieving table and pressurized water, yielding more than 2000 fossil specimens. The assemblage is composed of anatomically identifiable elements of charophytes, ostracods, molluscs, fish, albanerpetontids, anurans, lepidosauromorphs, chelonians, a pterosaur?, theropods, crocodyliformes, eggshells and a mammaliaforms?, as well as bone splinters, shell fragments and plant remains. Charophyte utriculi, ostracods, isolated teeth and eggshells are the most abundant elements. The association has yielded Allocaudata remains as well as an unidentified family of Anura (based on a maxilla fragment) and an unidentified family of Neosuchia (based on isolated teeth). The Buenache assemblage shows a sound demy (i.e. fossils found in their original habitat) of an aquatic freshwater ecosystem, as is natural for a wetland ecosystem. The wide variety of microhabitats linked to water availability in wetlands gives rise to a complex faunal assemblage in which four categories of species can be recognized as in extant wetlands: obligate, amphibious, facultative and incidental. Despite the taphonomic differences between Buenache, Una and Las Hoyas, a common palaeoecological structure is documented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Regional Reanalysis (RR) is vital for TP due to the limitations of observations. In this work, a 62-year (1961-2022) long atmospheric regional reanalysis with spatial resolution of 9 km (convective gray-zone scale) and temporal resolution of 1 hour over the TP (TPRR) was developed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, combined with re-initialization method, spectral nudging (SN), and several optimizations. TPRR is forced by ERA5 at hourly intervals. TPRR outperforms ERA5, realistically capturing climatological characteristics and seasonal variations of precipitation and T2m (air temperature at 2m above ground level). Moreover, TPRR better reproduces the frequency and intensity of precipitation, as well as the diurnal cycle of precipitation. This study also quantifies the wetting trend of 0.0071 mm/year over the TP amid global warming using TPRR.

J	Tamire, G; Mengistou, S				Tamire, Girum; Mengistou, Seyoum			Macrophyte species composition, distribution and diversity in relation to some physicochemical factors in the littoral zone of Lake Ziway, Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The species composition, distribution and diversity of macrophytes in Lake Ziway were determined at the end of dry and wet seasons along nine littoral sites during 2010 using a belt transect method. Some physicochemical parameters were also measured. Fourteen macrophyte species were identified with low species diversity for the lake (H' value of 1.805). The macrophyte species composition of the lake has undergone many changes during the last few decades. Arundo donax, which was never reported earlier, attained the highest relative density (30.7%) and frequency (30.5%) in this study, followed by Echinochloa colona, Potamogeton schweinfurthii, Cyperus articulatus, Typha latifolia and Cyperus papyrus. The average densities of A.donax, C.articulatus, E.colona and Pistia stratiotes were positively correlated with nutrients, whereas the density of the other species had negative correlation with physicochemical variables (CCA). Generally, the present macrophyte composition and abundance indicates healthy ecological condition of the lake. But if nutrient levels continue to increase and water levels continue to decline, we expect further changes in macrophyte composition and especially a shift towards invasive floating species.

Role of ambient light in structuring north-temperate fish communities: potential effects of increasing dissolved organic carbon concentration with a changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												The vertical light environment in freshwater lakes is sensitive to changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and DOC concentrations in most boreal lakes appear to be increasing as the climate changes. Understanding how DOC dynamics in lakes and watersheds are then linked to fish habitat is therefore critical to assessing the effects of climate change on fish communities. This paper reviews the evidence for climate-induced alterations to DOC in north-temperate watersheds and assesses the potential consequences of the resultant decreases in water clarity on fish production and community structure in small boreal lakes (<500 ha). Although DOC increases are forecast for most boreal lakes, complex interactions between local climate, rates of terrestrial organic matter decomposition and runoff, existing water quality, species shifts in forest communities, and changing season lengths can all combine to affect the magnitude of water clarity declines that will occur in individual lakes. Elevated DOC concentrations will affect the availability of coldwater versus warmwater habitat and niche characteristics that are dependent on lake depth, water clarity, and the preferences and physiological tolerances of the individual species. The shifts in availability of suitable thermal habitat will in turn affect fish growth, production, and community composition. Range expansions for warmwater species and range reductions for coldwater species will likely occur in warmer, darker environments, with adverse consequences for some native species and likely advantages for invasive species such as smallmouth bass. Likewise, major shifts in trophic dynamics would accompany the darkening of boreal lakes as species-specific feeding efficiencies change and primary and secondary production are altered. From a beneficial perspective, elevated DOC concentrations will likely relieve some physiological stress in biota via protection against contaminant toxicity and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. As with many other disturbances, we need to view climate change impacts on fish communities as a multiple stressor problem and the potential impacts of the changing light environment needs to be given as much prominence as the study of stressors such as eutrophication and trace contaminants.

J	Wang, SF; Xing, DH; Jia, YF; Li, BA; Wang, KL				Wang, Shaofeng; Xing, Denghua; Jia, Yonfeng; Li, Biao; Wang, Kuanling			The distribution of total mercury and methyl mercury in a shallow hypereutrophic lake (Lake Taihu) in two seasons	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												To understand the geochemical cycle of Hg in hypereutrophic freshwater lake, two sampling campaigns were conducted in Lake Taihu in China during May and September of 2009. The concentrations of unfiltered total Hg (unfTHg) were in the range of 6.8-83 ng L-1 (28 +/- 18 ng L-1) in the lake water and total Hg in the sediment was 12-470 ng g(-1), both of which are higher than in other background lakes. The concentration of unfTHg in similar to 11% of the lake water samples exceeded the second class of the Chinese environmental standards for surface water of 50 ng L-1 (GB 3838-2002), indicating that a high ecological risk is posed by the Hg in Lake Taihu. However, the concentrations of unfiltered total MeHg (unfMeHg) were relatively low in the lake water (0.14 +/- 0.05 ng L-1, excluding two samples with 0.81 and 1.0 ng L-1). Lake sediment MeHg varied from 0.2-0.96 ng g(-1), with generally low ratios of MeHg/THg of <1%. The low concentrations of TMeHg in the lake water may have resulted from a strong uptake by the high primary productivity and the demethylation of MeHg in oxic conditions. In addition, contrary to the results of previous research conducted in deep-water lakes and reservoirs, the low concentrations of MeHg and low ratio of MeHg/THg in the lake sediment indicates that the net methylation of Hg was not accelerated by the elevated organic matter load created by the eutrophication of Lake Taihu. The results also showed that sediments were a source of THg and MeHg in the water. Higher diffusion fluxes of THg and MeHg may be partly responsible for the higher concentrations of THg in the lake water in May, 2009. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on remote sensing methods for the analysis of 4 Italian lakes with diverse geological origins, leveraging water quality samples and data from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5.7-8 platforms. Chl-a, a well-correlated indicator of phytoplankton biomass abundance and eutrophication, was estimated using ordinary least squares linear regression to calibrate surface reflectance with chl-a concentrations. Temporal gaps between sample and image acquisition were considered, and atmospheric correction dedicated to water surfaces was implemented using ACOLITE and those specific to each satellite platform. The developed models achieved determination coefficients higher than 0.69 with mean square errors close to 3 mg/m(3) for water bodies with low turbidity. Furthermore, the time series described by the models portray the seasonal variations in the lakes water bodies.					; Tellez Jurado, Alejandro/T-1835-2019; messineo, valentina/JCE-7327-2023	Messineo, valentina/0000-0001-6336-1768; Kallikkattil Kuruvila, Ashish/0009-0003-9665-9730; Laneve, Giovanni/0000-0001-6108-9764; 														2072-4292				MAY	2024	16	10							1792	10.3390/rs16101792	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16101792													WOS:001231455200001

Mapping spatial and temporal Chl-a distributions derived from multispectral satellite data is therefore increasingly popular for monitoring trends in trophic state of these important ecosystems. We evaluated products of eleven atmospheric correction processors (LEDAPS, LaSRC, Sen2Cor, ACOLITE, ATCOR, C2RCC, DOS 1, FLAASH, iCOR, Polymer, and QUAC) and 27 reflectance indexes (including band-ratio, three-band, and four-band algorithms) recommended for Chl-a concentration retrieval. These were applied to the western basin of Lake Ontario by pairing 236 satellite scenes from Landsat 5, 7, 8, and Sentinel-2 acquired between 2000 and 2022 to 600 near-synchronous and co-located in situ-measured Chl-a concentrations. The in situ data were categorized based on location, seasonality, and Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI). Linear regression Chl-a models were calibrated for each processing scheme plus data category. The models were compared using a range of performance metrics. Categorization of data based on trophic state yielded improved outcomes. Furthermore, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data provided the best results, while Landsat 5 and 7 underperformed. A total of 28 Chl-a models were developed across the different data categorization schemes, with RMSEs ranging from 1.1 to 14.1 mu g/L. ACOLITE-corrected images paired with the blue-to-green band ratio emerged as the generally best performing scheme. However, model performance was dependent on the data filtration practices and varied between satellites.					; Shahvaran, Ali Reza/ISS-3851-2023	Shahvaran, Ali Reza/0000-0001-7846-054X; 														2072-4292				MAY	2024	16	9							1595	10.3390/rs16091595	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16091595													WOS:001220645800001

Current knowledge of South American cladoceran diapause: A brief review	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The study of the structure and dynamics of cladoceran egg banks in South America began only 15 years ago and the amount of knowledge, in addition to being scarce, is widely spread over partially national journals, theses, and books, and thus partially unavailable. We conducted a review of the literature published for this region, focusing mainly on the methodological approaches that have been applied and describe the main findings already published. The different methodological approaches make data comparability difficult. However, a total of 77 egg morphotypes were identified in the published studies. Among the variety of methods used, we suggest to adopt as the standard procedure: 1) pre isolation of eggs from the sediments by the Sugar Flotation Method; 2) identification, enumeration, and sorting of egg morphotypes present in the sample; 3) individual hatching of each egg morphotype; 4) adult individual identification to the species level according to available keys; and 5) linking identified eggs to identified species' adults. The absence of identification keys constitutes a challenge. Therefore, collaborative research with the aim of generating pictorial taxonomical support for Neotropical resting eggs are encouraged. We believe the adoption of the suggested protocol might facilitate this issue. An extremely low hatching success was reported for most studies and the factors triggering the break of dormancy in the resting eggs coming from permanent systems remain unknown. In conclusion, resting egg studies are a novel and promising field in South America, but with many challenges that need to be addressed.

Diffusive exchange of PAHs across the air-water interface of the Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon, Taiwan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Instantaneous air water polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exchange fluxes were calculated in 22 pairs of ambient air and water samples from Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon, from December 2003 to January 2005. The highest net volatilization (3135 ng m(-2) day(-1)) and absorptive (-1150 ng m(-2) day(-1)) fluxes in the present study were obtained for the three-ring PAH phenanthrene on 7 April and 27 January 2004, respectively. All PAH diffusive fluxes for three-ring PAHs except phenanthrene were mainly volatilization exchange across the air-water interface. Phenanthrene and the four-ring PAHs were absorbed primarily from the atmosphere and deposited to the surface water, although some minor volatilization fluxes were also observed. Differences in flux magnitude and direction between the dry and wet seasons were also evident for PAHs. Strong absorptive/weaker volatilization PAH fluxes occurred in the dry season, but the opposite was found in the wet season. The mean daily PAH diffusive fluxes were an in flux of -635 ng m(-2) day(-1) in the dry season and an efflux of 686 ng m(-2) day(-1) in the wet season. The integrated absorbed and emitted fluxes of PAHs for harbor lagoon surface waters in the dry and wet seasons were 3.1 kg and 3.4 kg, respectively. Different from water bodies located in temperate zone, phenanthrene diffusive fluxes in Kaohsiung Harbor lagoon was favored in volatilization from surface waters during the wet season (April to September) because of scavenging by precipitation and dilution by prevailing southwesterly winds. In addition, this study used both of salinity and temperature to improve estimation of Henry's law constants (H) of PAHs in a tropical coastal area and show that correction for salinity produced 13-15% of differences in H values.

J	Bonhof, WJ; Pryor, AJE				Bonhof, Wouter J.; Pryor, Alexander J. E.			Proboscideans on Parade: A review of the migratory behaviour of elephants, mammoths, and mastodons	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The ecology and behaviour of woolly and Columbian mammoths and mastodons have been extensively studied. Despite this, their patterns of mobility, and particularly the question of whether or not they migrated habitually, remains unclear. This paper summarises the current state of knowledge regarding mobility in these species, reviewing comparative datasets from extant elephant populations as well as isotopic data measured directly on the ancient animals themselves. Seasonal migration is not common in modern elephants and varies between years. Nonetheless, nonmigratory elephants can still have considerable home ranges, whose size is affected mainly by habitat, seasonal availability of water and food, and biological sex. Strontium isotope analyses of woolly mammoths, Columbian mammoths, and mastodons demonstrate plasticity in their migratory behaviour as well, probably in response to spatio-temporal variations in ecological conditions. However, biological sex is difficult to establish for most proboscidean fossils and its influence on the results of Sr analyses can therefore not be assessed. Advances in intra-tooth sampling and analytical methods for strontium isotope analysis have enabled research on intra-annual movement, revealing nomadic behaviour in all three species. Sulfur isotopes have been analysed from woolly mammoth remains numerous times, but its methodology is not yet developed well enough to inform on past proboscidean mobility in as much detail as strontium studies. The inter- and intra-individual variation in migratory behaviour in mammoths and mastodons implies that their role in the subsistence strategies of Palaeolithic people may have fluctuated as well. Further assessment of hominin-proboscidean predator-prey interactions will require a more detailed understanding of proboscidean habitual mobility in specific contexts and places. Strontium isotope studies based on multi-year enamel sequences from multiple individuals have the potential to provide this insight. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The species composition of rotifers relative to a variety of microhabitats was studied in eight small rivers of this region in 2017. Our research is a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis that focuses on the rotifers in small rivers and shows the diversity of rotifers relative to the microhabitats and environmental variables. The diversity of rotifers ranged from 0 to 23 taxa in individual samples. In the studied rivers, 129 taxa of rotifers were found. Notommata groenlandica, a species that has not been recorded in the country for 100 years, was found in two rivers. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Dunn's multiple comparison post hoc tests revealed statistically significant differences in the median number of rotifer taxa between the abiotic types of rivers, rivers, sampling sites, microhabitats and seasons. A multiple regression analysis revealed a significant relationship (correlation) between the number of rotifer taxa, and the concentration of nitrites, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen in the water.					; Halabowski, Dariusz/HCI-4321-2022	Lewin, Iga/0000-0001-5204-2120; Halabowski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5841-559X														1424-2818				FEB	2022	14	2							127	10.3390/d14020127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14020127													WOS:000764292500001

The HFMS was designed for monitoring water quality, nutrient inputs by main tributaries, water currents and meteorology at different sites at Lake Qiandao. The EWS focused on data availability, a QC method, a statistical analysis method and data applications instead of technological aspects for sondes, wireless data transfer and interface software development. QC was implemented before use to delete the abnormal values of outliers, to detect change points, to analyse the change trend, to interpolate discrete missing measurements, and find continuous missing or wrong observations caused by technical problems with the sonde. For demonstrating advantages and data availability, surface and profiling measurements at two sites were plotted. The plots show obvious seasonal and diel variations, demonstrating the success of integration of the system with advanced automated technology and good QC. This successfully developed system is now not only giving early warning signals, but also providing critical WQ information for the security of drinking water diverted to Hangzhou city through a tunnel of 110 km length. The automatic monitoring data with QC is also being used to produce initial conditions for WQ prediction based on a three dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model.

J	Saberi, N; Scott, KA; Duguay, C				Saberi, Nastaran; Scott, Katharine Andrea; Duguay, Claude			Incorporating Aleatoric Uncertainties in Lake Ice Mapping Using RADARSAT-2 SAR Images and CNNs	REMOTE SENSING												With the increasing availability of SAR imagery in recent years, more research is being conducted using deep learning (DL) for the classification of ice and open water; however, ice and open water classification using conventional DL methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is not yet accurate enough to replace manual analysis for operational ice chart mapping. Understanding the uncertainties associated with CNN model predictions can help to quantify errors and, therefore, guide efforts on potential enhancements using more-advanced DL models and/or synergistic approaches. This paper evaluates an approach for estimating the aleatoric uncertainty [a measure used to identify the noise inherent in data] of CNN probabilities to map ice and open water with a custom loss function applied to RADARSAT-2 HH and HV observations. The images were acquired during the 2014 ice season of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, two of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Operational image analysis charts from the Canadian Ice Service (CIS), which are based on visual interpretation of SAR imagery, are used to provide training and testing labels for the CNN model and to evaluate the accuracy of the model predictions. Bathymetry, as a variable that has an impact on the ice regime of lakes, was also incorporated during model training in supplementary experiments. Adding aleatoric loss and bathymetry information improved the accuracy of mapping water and ice. Results are evaluated quantitatively (accuracy metrics) and qualitatively (visual comparisons). Ice and open water scores were improved in some sections of the lakes by using aleatoric loss and including bathymetry. In Lake Erie, the ice score was improved by similar to 2 on average in the shallow near-shore zone as a result of better mapping of dark ice (low backscatter) in the western basin. As for Lake Ontario, the open water score was improved by similar to 6 on average in the deepest profundal off-shore zone.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Saberi, Nastaran/0000-0003-2397-2040; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850														2072-4292				FEB	2022	14	3							644	10.3390/rs14030644	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14030644													WOS:000755493500001

Such monitoring must be both extensive and intensive to account for the short- and long-term biomass variations. This may be achieved by the remote estimation of chla through an orbital sensor with high temporal resolution. In this study, we used MODIS imagery to produce 21-year time series of chla for three strategic lakes of the Brazilian semi-arid region: Eng. Armando Ribeiro Goncalves, Castanhao, and Oros. We used data collected in 13 lakes of the region to test new and published regression models for chla estimation. The selected model was validated and applied to daily MODIS images for the three largest lakes. The resulting chla time series revealed that the temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass is associated with the hydraulic regime of the lakes, with chla plummeting upon intense water renewal and keeping high during persistent dry periods. The intense rainy season of 2004 reduced the phytoplankton biomass and its effects even extended to the subsequent years. Our results encourage the exploration of the MODIS archived imagery in limnological studies.

Effect of nesting environment on incubation temperature and hatching success of Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) in an urban lake of Southeastern Mexico	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Incubation temperature is an important aspect in terms of biological performance among crocodiles, and several controlled experiments have demonstrated a significant relationship between incubation temperature, success in hatching and survival of hatchlings. However, a few studies have tested these relationships in the wild. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of nest characteristics and environment (hatch year, nest basal area and height, clutch size, distance to shore line, and vegetation cover), to incubation temperature and hatching success among Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). The study was carried out during the nesting seasons of Morelet's crocodile, from 2007 to 2009 in the Laguna de Las Ilusiones, an urban lake located in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. We physically characterized 18 nests and inserted a temperature data logger in each nest chamber. At the end of the nesting season and prior to hatching, we recovered the crocodile eggs and data loggers and calculated hatching success, under laboratory conditions. We related the environmental variables of the nest with the mean and fluctuation (standard deviation) of nest temperature, using linear models. We also related the environmental variables affecting the nest, to mean nest temperature and fluctuation in incubation temperature and to hatching success, using linear models. Although we found differences in incubation temperature between nests, mean incubation temperature did not differ between years, but there were differences in nest thermal fluctuation between years. The mean incubation temperature for 11 nests (61.1%) was lower than the suggested Female-Male pivotal temperature (producing 50% of each sex) for this species, and all hatchlings obtained were males. There were no differences in clutch size between years, but hatching success varied. Our study indicates that hatching success depends on certain environmental variables and nest conditions to which the eggs are subjected, including season, nest size and clutch size. We also discuss the importance of the fluctuation of incubation temperature on hatching success and sex determination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chilika Lagoon, the largest brackish lake ecosystem in East Asia, experienced severe problems such as excessive dominance of freshwater exotic plants and rapid debasement of biodiversity associated with decreased hydrologic connectivity between the lagoon and the ocean. To halt the degradation of the lagoon ecosystem, the Chilika Development Authority implemented a restoration project, creating a new channel to penetrate the barrier beach of the lagoon. Using a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we compared the trend of vegetation changes after the lagoon restoration, from April 1998 to May 2014. The time series of NDVI data were decomposed into trend, seasonal, and random components using a local regression method. The results were visualized to understand the traits of spatial distribution in the lagoon. The NDVI trend, indicative of primary productivity, decreased rapidly during the restoration period, and gradually increased (slope coefficient: 2.1 x 10(-4), p < 0.05) after two years of restoration. Level of seawater exchange had more influences on plant productivity than local precipitation in the restored lagoon. Higher El Nino/Southern Oscillation increased sea level pressure, and caused intrusion of seawater into the lagoon, and the subsequently elevated salinity decreased the annual mean NDVI. Our findings suggest that lagoon restoration plans for enhancing interconnectivity with the ocean should consider oceanographic effects due to meteorological forcing, and long-term NDVI results can be used as a valuable index for adaptive management of the restoration site.

Nitrogen Limitation of Pond Ecosystems on the Plains of Eastern Colorado	PLOS ONE												Primary production in freshwater ecosystems is often limited by the availability of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), or a combination of both (NP co-limitation). While N fixation via heterocystous cyanobacteria can supply additional N, no comparable mechanism for P exists; hence P is commonly considered to be the predominant and ultimate limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. However, N limitation can be maintained if P is supplied in stoichiometric excess of N (including N fixation). The main objective of this study was to examine patterns in nutrient limitation across a series of 21 vernal ponds in Eastern Colorado where high P fluxes are common. Across all ponds, water column dissolved inorganic N steadily decreased throughout the growth season due to biological demand while total dissolved P remained stable. The water column dissolved inorganic N to total dissolved P ratios suggested a transition from NP co-limitation to N limitation across the growth season. Periphyton and phytoplankton %C was strongly correlated with %N while %P was assimilated in excess of %N and %C in many ponds. Similarly, in nutrient addition bottle assays algae responded more strongly to N additions (11 out of 18 water bodies) than P additions (2 out of 18 water bodies) and responded most strongly when N and P were added in concert (12 out of 18 water bodies). Of the ponds that responded to nutrient addition, 92% exhibited some sort of N limitation while less than 8% were limited by P alone. Despite multiple lines of evidence for N limitation or NP co-limitation, N fixation rates were uniformly low across most ponds, most likely due to inhibition by water column nitrate. Within this set of 18 water bodies, N limitation or NP co-limitation is widespread due to the combination high anthropogenic P inputs and constrained N fixation rates.					; Townsend, Alan/AAE-9602-2019	Mischler, John/0009-0003-5838-7551; 													1932-6203					MAY 13	2014	9	5							e95757	10.1371/journal.pone.0095757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095757								24824838					WOS:000336369200008

Here, we investigated this issue in three subtropical forests of different maturity [i.e. a young pine forest (PF), a transitional mixed conifer and broadleaf forest (MF) and an old-growth broadleaved forest (BF)] in southern China. Soil respiration was measured over two years under four simulated acid rain (SAR) treatments (CK, the local lake water, pH 4.5; T1, water pH 4.0; T2, water pH 3.5; and T3, water pH 3.0). Results indicated that SAR did not significantly affect soil respiration in the PF, whereas it significantly reduced soil respiration in the MF and the BF. The depressed effects on both forests occurred mostly in the warm-wet seasons and were correlated with a decrease in soil microbial activity and in fine root biomass caused by soil acidification under SAR. The sensitivity of the response of soil respiration to SAR showed an increasing trend with the progressive maturity of the three forests, which may result from their differences in acid buffering ability in soil and in litter layer. These results indicated that the depressed effect of acid rain on soil respiration in southern China may be more pronounced in the future in light of the projected change in forest maturity. However, due to the nature of this field study with chronosequence design and the related pseudoreplication for forest types, this inference should be read with caution. Further studies are needed to draw rigorous conclusions regarding the response differences among forests of different maturity using replicated forest types.

A tree-ring-based drought index reconstruction for far-western Mongolia: 1565-2004	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Tree-ring records can provide longer, high-resolution records of climate variability in remote regions such as western Mongolia, where recorded data are extremely limited. Here, we use three absolutely dated tree-ring-width chronologies to reconstruct the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for a grid point in western Mongolia (48.75 degrees N, 88.75 degrees W). A reconstruction of the June-September PDSI for this region extends from 1565 to 2003 and explains 41% of the total variance in the instrumental PDSI. The 439-year reconstruction shows that starting in the 20th Century and continuing into the 21st Century there is a large-scale regional increase in growing-season moisture conditions compared to the prior centuries, a trend not seen in central or eastern Mongolian tree-ring reconstructions. This increasing trend in western Mongolia is consistent with station observations and other nearby proxy records. The wettest 5-year period of the reconstruction is 1741-1745 followed by 1993-1997, and the driest period is 1755-1759, followed by 1882-1886. Spectral analysis shows significant periodicities at approximately 22, 11, 7 and 5 years. The reconstruction shows similar trends to a PDSI reconstruction from NW China during the 20th Century and also correlates with lake-level data from nearby Khar-Us Nuur, Mongolia.

Effects of climate variation and water levels on reservoir recreation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We combined information on valuation, visitation, and time-varying site quality to measure the effects of climate variation and reservoir water levels on recreational demand at Fort Cobb Reservoir, Oklahoma. A time series model of monthly visitation was estimated to measure the effect of water levels, rainfall, wind speed, and air temperature fluctuations on visitation to the reservoir. The results provide no evidence that visitation is affected by rainfall and wind speed but strong evidence that visitation is affected by water levels and air temperature, even after controlling for seasonality in demand. The results suggest annual reservoir visitation will increase by 2.30 for a 0.5 C (1 F) increase in average annual temperature, but that this increase will vary depending on the month and baseline temperatures; managers can expect an increase of 3.5% to occur in October through May, with essentially no increase in June through September. Visitation increases due to temperatures could potentially be offset with slight changes in water levels away from normal pool heights, however. To illustrate the potential use of these predictions in benefit and damage assessments of environmental change, a nonmarket valuation method was employed to value recreational trips to the reservoir. The results indicate a trip is worth about $60 per person. With explicit values for recreation, lake and reservoir managers may find it easier to gauge the economic benefits of managing lake levels for nonconsumptive uses.

Allochthonous and autochthonous carbon in deep, organic-rich and organic-poor lakes of the European Russian subarctic	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												To reveal the degree of allochthonous vs. autochthonous control on carbon dynamics in deep, boreal lakes, we studied two (one organic-rich and one organic-poor) small (similar to 0.1 km(2)) and deep (similar to 40 m), seasonally stratified lakes located in the European subarctic zone (NW Russia, Arkhangelsk region) during a 2.5-year period. The dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) concentrations were 15-30 mg l(-1) and 0.5.9 mg l(-1) in the humic lake and 0.8-4.3 mg l(-1) and 18-52 mg l(-1) in the organic-poor lake, respectively. The DOC profile in the organic-poor lake was sensitive to phytoplankton blooms in July-August and snowmelt in May, whereas the organic-rich lake was a highly stable system throughout the year in both the epilimnion and hypolimnion, with significant (ca. 40%) increase in DOC concentration in the hypolimnion relative to the epilimnion. The ratio of dissolved organic carbon to organic nitrogen (C-org/N-org) was significantly lower in the organic-poor lake, reflecting a strong impact of autochthonous N-org production and N diffusion from the sediment to the water column. There was a clear difference in the vertical pattern of the proportion of the low molecular weight (LMW < 1 kDa) organic carbon (OC) between the humic and the organic-poor lakes. Regardless of season, the organic-poor lake's LMW < 1 kDa was 40%-90%, whereas that of the organic-rich lake 20%-30%. This difference was most likely linked to the dominance of peat soil and bog providing allochthonous OC to the organic-rich lake throughout the year, and possible production of LMW autochthonous organic ligands by phytoplankton and photodegradation in the organic-poor lake. The important role of allochthonous organic matter (OM) in the color properties of the lake water was confirmed by the light absorbance in the visual range and specific ultraviolet absorption measurements. Overall, deep humic (organic-rich) lakes are expected to be less sensitive to external impacts and possible climate change. The evaluation of both number and depth of humic lakes in the boreal zone is crucial for assessing their CO2 emission and carbon storage potential.

Seasonal sampling was conducted for 2 years, covering three areas (south, centre and north) and the pelagic and littoral zones in Mangueira Lake (southern Brazil). The zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio, usually, was very low, indicating a weak top-down control on phytoplankton; however, the strength of this interaction varied with zooplankton composition and temporal or spatial variability of the environmental factors. Environmental, bottom-up and probably top-down forces involved the structure of zooplankton, whereas phytoplankton was mainly controlled by nutrients. The phytoplankton predominant biomass consisted of colonial forms of non-toxic cyanobacteria. Rotifers (90-150 mu m) were more able to benefit from phytoplankton production, whereas large-bodied zooplankton, when present in higher biomass, were not related to phytoplankton. High contribution of small ciliates and significant positive correlations between zooplankton and total phosphorus presuppose that microbial food webs primarily sustain the macro-zooplankton production in this system. The environmental variability induced by wind action or diversification of niches also played a substantial role in the structure of the plankton community, and the strength of zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions.

Modeling Otolith Weight using Fish Age and Length: Applications to Age Determination	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Relationships among otolith weight and age have been explored widely as cost-effective means to predict age. However, otolith weight is influenced by both fish age and somatic growth, making it necessary to partition these confounding effects to best use otolith weight to predict age. We used several hatchery strains of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush that varied in capture season, year, location, and mean size at stocking to develop a maximum likelihood model of otolith weight as complementary but independent functions of age ( mg/year) and fish length ( mg/mm). Once these relationships were established, we determined age probabilities for each fish based on their measurements. Our best model included age and somatic growth components, with cumulative mean temperature as a variable to scale for seasonal differences in otolith accretion. For fish between 3 and 19 years of age, otolith weight increased by 1.16 mg/year, with an additional somatic growth component of 0.62 x exp( fish length x 0.0038) mg/mm. We correctly assigned age to 60% of the age-3 fish, but this decreased to about 10% among the oldest age-classes; however, predicted age residuals approximated normal distributions within each age-class. The model was robust to seasonal and annual variation, but somatic growth differences among some strain and stocking-size groupings resulted in modal aging biases of +/- 1 year. Given the stability in otolith weight components arising from fish age and somatic growth, we suggest that modeling otolith weight using reader age estimates offers a new quality assurance/quality control tool to assess whether reader ages support the widely documented properties of otolith growth. When otolith weight and fish length are more informative of age, our model may also be useful in estimating age composition data similar to an age-length key.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	4					778	790		10.1080/00028487.2017.1310138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1310138													WOS:000403848200017

The lake environment is fragile and critically threatened by human-induced factors. The study presented a steady and transient numerical modeling. The long-term and system flux over time interaction between the lake and the surficial aquifer is represented in the Lake Package LAK3 with in the advanced 3-D simulation sofware (GMS). The model covers an area of 1817 km(2). Model calibration was constrained by the observed groundwater and lake levels using PEST. The effect of excessive abstraction was rigorously analyzed via scenario analysis. The simulation was evaluated "with abstraction'' and "without abstraction'' scenarios. The abstraction scenario was simulated using range of combination assuming that all the abstraction was from the lake or the groundwater and in the ratio of groundwater and lake water. The effect of the stress was evaluated based on the observed aquifer heads and lake stage at the end of the simulation time. The development of low groundwater-level anomalies in the well field is explained. The result indicates that the one of the well fields is not in direct hydraulic connection to the main recharging water body. Apparently, similar development of cone of depression was not generated in the other two well fields, and this could have several reasons including due to the fact that these well fields are located relatively close by to the main recharging zones and concluded to have additional source of recharge, and this was supported by previous studies, whereby the isotopic composition of the boreholes has their source of recharge from precipitation and river and was also confirmed from the isotopic composition of unsaturated zone, which is a mixture of river and rain. The study reveals that seasonal variability of groundwater-surface water exchange fluxes and its spatially and temporally variable impact substantially on the water resource availability. Such analysis can be used as a basis to quantify the linkages between the surface water and groundwater regime and impacts in the basin. The model output is expected to serve as a basis via linking/coupling with others to incorporate the ecology and biodiversity of the lake to safeguard this high- value world heritage water feature.

Finding balance between fire hazard reduction and erosion control in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The 2007 Angora Fire served as a stark reminder of the need for fuel reduction treatments in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada, USA. Concerns exist, however, that the corresponding removal of forest floor fuels could increase erosion rates, negatively affecting the clarity of Lake Tahoe. To quantify trade-offs between fuel reduction and erosion, we conducted field-based snowmelt runoff simulation experiments at 16 sites within the Lake Tahoe Basin that had received mechanical mastication or prescribed fire treatments. Erodibility was measured to determine if thresholds of litter, duff, and woody fuel cover could be established that are sufficient for trapping sediment and increasing infiltration, without contributing to fire hazard. Field snow-melt simulations revealed that as little as 25% of the ground surface covered with masticated fuels over duff was sufficient to mitigate erosion. The post-prescribed fire environment characterized by heterogeneous patches of exposed bare mineral soil interspersed with unburned patches mitigated erosion by increasing infiltration. Considerable increases in sediment yield were observed in plots with >35% of ground area burned; the highest total sediment yields (values) occurred in plots where between 66% and 100% of the soil surface burned. Our field results suggest that erosion and wildfire severity can be simultaneously mitigated through the use of masticated fuel reduction treatments or prescribed fire treatments that leave sufficient organic matter to trap sediment but have sufficiently low fuel loading and/or enough fuel discontinuity or patchiness to limit fire spread.

Such transients were the hydroxyl ((OH)-O-center dot) and carbonate (CO3') radicals, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*). Among the investigated lakes, Lake Iseo, for example, showed a long-term near-stability in chemical parameters that resulted in a photochemical stability. By contrast, Piburgersee underwent important chemical modifications, but the interplay of compensation (parallel increase of both inorganic and organic carbon) and near-saturation effects (organic matter as main (OH)-O-center dot source and sink) prevented the modelled photochemistry to undergo significant shifts over time. This result suggests the occurrence of a sort of "photochemical buffering" in some lake ecosystems, which would dampen modifications of the steady-state concentration of the photochemically-formed reactive transients, even in the case of significant changes in water chemistry. Finally, in lakes Garda and Geneva, long-term changes in water chemistry had an effect on photochemistry. While in Lake Garda the small increase in DOM was associated to a small increase in O-1(2) and (CDOM)-C-3*, in Lake Geneva, the increases in pH and bicarbonate and the decrease in nitrite resulted in an (OH)-O-center dot decrease. Overall, our results predict very different lake photochemistry patterns in relation to alterations in water chemistry parameters caused by climate change, such as changes in water alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon concentration.

J	Reid, RJ; Mosley, LM				Reid, R. J.; Mosley, L. M.			Comparative contributions of solution geochemistry, microbial metabolism and aquatic photosynthesis to the development of high pH in ephemeral wetlands in South East Australia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The development of alkaline conditions in lakes and wetlands is common but the process of alkalinisation is not well elaborated. In this study we investigated causes of the seasonal alkalinisation of ephemeral wetlands in the South East of South Australia where pH values above 10 are frequently observed. This research combined field observations, geochemical analysis of wetland sediment and surface water, with mesocosm studies under controlled conditions. The results revealed a complex interplay between a number of different processes. A primary cause was attributed to sequestration of CO2 from the water column by plant photosynthesis, coupled with slow diffusion of CO2 from the air which led to its depletion in the water. Abundant plant growth also modified the water chemistry via uptake of nutrient elements, in particular calcium and magnesium and increased carbonate alkalinity in the water. Assessment of field results and geochemical modeling showed that low Ca/(HCO3- and CO3-2) ratios in the water, coupled with carbonate mineral (calcite, Mg substituted calcite, dolomite) precipitation and evapoconcentration, create a high alkalinity and pH (>9) baseline in many wetlands. The high baseline pH is then further increased by CO2 depletion due to photosynthesis. We could find no evidence that reduction of sulfate to sulfides by sulfur-reducing bacteria significantly contributed to the very high pH conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the identity of the producers, their preferred ecological niche and seasonality are uncertain. We applied a gene-based approach to determine the identity and abundance of Eustigmatophyceae 18S rRNA genes and compared the data with the distribution of LCDs in the water column of Lake Challa (East Africa). Gene-based analysis revealed three known and two novel Eustigmatophyceae groups. Maxima in the number of gene copies and LCD concentration coincided at 9 m water depth, signifying Eustigmatophyceae as important producers of LCDs. In addition, seasonal changes in LCD abundance in sedimenting particles revealed several blooms of LCD producers over the annual cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Real-time remote sensing driven river basin modeling using radar altimetry	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Many river basins have a weak in-situ hydrometeorological monitoring infrastructure. However, water resources practitioners depend on reliable hydrological models for management purposes. Remote sensing (RS) data have been recognized as an alternative to in-situ hydrometeorological data in remote and poorly monitored areas and are increasingly used to force, calibrate, and update hydrological models. In this study, we evaluate the potential of informing a river basin model with real-time radar altimetry measurements over reservoirs. We present a lumped, conceptual, river basin water balance modeling approach based entirely on RS and reanalysis data: precipitation was obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast's (ECMWF) Operational Surface Analysis dataset and reference evapotranspiration was derived from temperature data. The Ensemble Kalman Filter was used to assimilate radar altimetry (ERS2 and Envisat) measurements of reservoir water levels. The modeling approach was applied to the Syr Darya River Basin, a snowmelt-dominated basin with large topographical variability, several large reservoirs and scarce hydrometeorological data that is located in Central Asia and shared between 4 countries with conflicting water management interests. The modeling approach was tested over a historical period for which in-situ reservoir water levels were available. Assimilation of radar altimetry data significantly improved the performance of the hydrological model. Without assimilation of radar altimetry data, model performance was limited, probably because of the size and complexity of the model domain, simplifications inherent in model design, and the uncertainty of RS and reanalysis data. Altimetry data assimilation reduced the mean absolute error of the simulated reservoir water levels from 4.7 to 1.9 m, and overall model RMSE from 10.3 m to 6.7 m. Model performance was variable for the different reservoirs in the system. The RMSE ranged from 10% to 76% of the mean seasonal reservoir level variation. Because of its easy accessibility and immediate availability, radar altimetry lends itself to being used in real-time hydrological applications. As an impartial source of information about the hydrological system that can be updated in real time, the modeling approach described here can provide useful medium-term hydrological forecasts to be used in water resources management.					; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/HCI-0972-2022; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/G-8725-2011	Riegels, Niels/0000-0001-8136-0646; Siegfried, Tobias/0000-0002-2995-9253; Pereira, Silvio/0000-0003-2803-5320; Bauer-Gottwein, Peter/0000-0002-9861-4240													1027-5606	1607-7938					2011	15	1					241	254		10.5194/hess-15-241-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-15-241-2011													WOS:000286723600019

Here we examine the role of conditional cash transfer programs, in particular the emblematic Brazilian Bolsa Fam?lia (BFP), in driving nutritional transition in rural areas of the Amazon. Based on ethnographic research with both participating and nonparticipating women in the Aman? Sustainable Development Reserve (SDR), our analysis integrates Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ), seasonal 24-hour food intake recalls, and stable isotope ratios in fingernails to examine dietary behavioral change. Contrary to dietary changes observed elsewhere in the Amazon, participation in the BFP is not associated with a significant substitution of local staples for industrialized processed foods in Aman?. While an increase in the consumption of some industrialized foods was observed, it has been selective and it has not changed the structure of diets. Factors such as social and cultural value of local staples, resident?s involvement with the SDR, their relationship with lake and upland forest and agricultural environments, and limited market access have buffered the expansion of industrialized processed foods as observed elsewhere.					; Nardoto, Gabriela/J-7459-2012; Brondizio, Eduardo/R-7643-2019; Lima, Ana/M-7271-2019	NASCIMENTO, ANA CLAUDEISE SILVA DO/0000-0002-3068-1324; Nardoto, Gabriela/0000-0001-8062-7417; Brondizio, Eduardo/0000-0001-9376-8366													0367-0244	1543-5237				MAR 3	2020	59	2					130	153		10.1080/03670244.2019.1678032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2019.1678032		OCT 2019						31630556					WOS:000491046200001

The Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar is no exception and rainfed production is particularly hard hit. To evaluate the agronomic benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) in a region of erratic rainfall, we analysed four years of yield, management and climatic data from 3803 upland rice fields cultivated by farmers and monitored by researchers. Fields located on rainfed lowlands and hillsides were cultivated with sole rice using conventional tillage (Cv) or rice sown with no-tillage on dead organic mulch and rotated with other cereal/legume combinations (CA) from 2006 to 2011. A first global comparison across seasons, locations and years of adoption showed significantly higher average yields under CA, with no change in variance (on lowland: 2.6 +/- 0.9 t ha(-1) Cv, 2.8 +/- 0.9 t ha(-1) CA; on hillside: 2.1 +/- 0.8 t ha(-1) Cv, 2.4 +/- 0.8 t ha(-1) CA). Grouping fields according to the number of years under CA (first to fourth) revealed that CA gradually increased average yields and reduced the coefficient of variation in the short and mid-term (on lowland: +0.2 t ha(-1) and -6% coefficient of variation; on hillside: +0.7 t ha(-1) and -13% coefficient of variation, over four to six years of successive CA cropping). The average yield increase under CA was not associated with an increase in mineral fertiliser use, as farmers used the same amounts of fertilisers (or none) under Cv and CA. The comparison Cv versus CA also highlighted a major benefit of CA regarding climate: it widened the window of possible sowing dates. A classification and regression tree analysis of the entire dataset revealed that rice yield was more affected by agro-environmental factors than management factors (fertilisation, Cv or CA), and extreme climate variability such as the severe drought of 2007-2008 could not be offset by CA. The hypothesis of yield penalties during the first years of implementation of CA cannot be verified with the evidence presented in this study.					; Scopel, Eric/NKO-7770-2025; Naudin, Krishna/G-3119-2010	Bruelle, Guillaume/0000-0002-8390-419X; Naudin, Krishna/0000-0002-9108-2456													0014-4797	1469-4441				JAN	2015	51	1					66	84		10.1017/S0014479714000155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479714000155													WOS:000346185200004

In this study, we first use the method that integrates synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity and phase information to monitor permafrost environment in the Beiluhe Region, using time series advanced SAR images. The backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) and deformation were extracted for the main features, and the influences of meteorological conditions to them were also quantified. The results show that both the change in s0 and surface deformation are closely related to the active layer, and the deformation is also affected by the permafrost table. First, over meadow and sparse vegetation regions, sigma(0) rose about 6.9 and 4 dB from the freezing to thawing period, respectively, which can be mainly attributed to the thaw of the active layer and increased precipitation. Second, seasonal deformation, derived from the freeze-thaw cycle of the active layer, was characteristic of frost heave and thaw settlement and exhibited a negative correlation with air temperature. Its magnitude was larger than 1 cm in a seasonal cycle. Last, significant secular settlement was observed, with rates ranging from -16 to 2 mm/a, and it was primarily due to the thaw of the permafrost table caused by climate warming.

River damming impacts nutrient cycling in watersheds through transformation and retention in the reservoirs. The bioavailability of silicon (Si) relative to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, in combination with light environment, controls diatom growth and therefore influences phytoplankton community compositions in most freshwater aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we quantified reactive Si cycling and annual Si retention in Lake Diefenbaker, a 394 km(2) prairie reservoir in Saskatchewan, Canada. Retention estimates were derived from 7 sediment cores combined with high-resolution spatiotemporal sampling of water column dissolved Si (DSi). Current annual DSi retention in the reservoir is approximately 28% of the influx, or 2.5 x 10(8) mol yr(-1). The relative retention of DSi is higher than that of bioavailable N, but lower than that of bioavailable P, indicating a decoupling of the P, N, and Si cycles in the reservoir. The largest accumulation of reactive particulate Si (PRSi) is found in sediments deposited in the mid-reservoir region, which corresponds to the region of highest epilimnetic DSi decrease during the 2013 open water season. This region corresponds to the fluvial-to-lacustrine transition zone, and represents a hot spot for Si retention. Differences in retention efficiencies of macronutrients may not only affect the in-reservoir ecology and water quality, but also modifies the N:P:Si ratios exported downstream, which has the potential to alter ecosystem processes in receiving water bodies.

Still, the lack of representative isolates and the few quantitative surveys leave the ecological role and significance of single bacterial populations to be revealed. Here we analyzed the diversity and dynamics of freshwater Flavobacteria populations in four eutrophic temperate lakes. From each lake, clone libraries were constructed using primers specific for either the class Flavobacteria or Bacteria. Sequencing of 194 Flavobacteria clones from 8 libraries revealed a diverse freshwater Flavobacteria community and distinct differences among lakes. Abundance and seasonal dynamics of Flavobacteria were assessed by quantitative PCR with class-specific primers. In parallel, the dynamics of individual populations within the Flavobacteria community were assessed with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using identical primers. The contribution of Flavobacteria to the total bacterioplankton community ranged from 0.4 to almost 100% (average, 24%). Blooms where Flavobacteria represented more than 30% of the bacterioplankton were observed at different times in the four lakes. In general, high proportions of Flavobacteria appeared during episodes of high bacterial production. Phylogenetic analyses combined with Flavobacteria community fingerprints suggested dominance of two Flavobacteria lineages. Both drastic alterations in total Flavobacteria and in community composition of this class significantly correlated with bacterial production, emphasizing that resource availability is an important driver of heterotrophic bacterial succession in eutrophic lakes.

J	Vaughn, CC; Hakenkamp, CC				Vaughn, CC; Hakenkamp, CC			The functional role of burrowing bivalves in freshwater ecosystems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Freshwater systems are losing biodiversity at a rapid rate, yet we know little about the functional role of most of this biodiversity. The ecosystem roles of freshwater burrowing bivalves have been particularly understudied. Here we summarize what is known about the functional role of burrowing bivalves in the orders Unionoida and Veneroida in lakes and streams globally. 2. Bivalves filter phytoplankton, bacteria and particulate organic matter from the water column. Corbicula and sphaeriids also remove organic matter from the sediment by deposit feeding, as may some unionids. Filtration rate varies with bivalve species and size, temperature, particle size and concentration, and flow regime. 3. Bivalves affect nutrient dynamics in freshwater systems, through excretion as well as biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces. Excretion rates are both size and species dependent, are influenced by reproductive stage, and vary greatly with temperature and food availability. 4. Bioturbation of sediments through bivalve movements increases sediment water and oxygen content and releases nutrients from the sediment to the water column. The physical presence of bivalve shells creates habitat for epiphytic and epizoic organisms, and stabilizes sediment and provides refugia for benthic fauna. Biodeposition of faeces and pseudofaeces can alter the composition of benthic communities. 5. There is conflicting evidence concerning the role of resource limitation in structuring bivalve communities. Control by bivalves of primary production is most likely when their biomass is large relative to the water volume and where hydrologic residence time is long. Future studies should consider exactly what bivalves feed upon, whether feeding varies seasonally and with habitat, and whether significant overlap in diet occurs. In particular, we need a clearer picture of the importance of suspension versus deposit feeding and the potential advantages and tradeoffs between these two feeding modes. 6. In North America, native burrowing bivalves (Unionidae) are declining at a catastrophic rate. This significant loss of benthic biomass, coupled with the invasion of an exotic burrowing bivalve (Corbicula), may result in large alterations of ecosystem processes and functions.

This study aimed to estimate the water surface evolution of the Kotychi Lagoon using optical remote sensing techniques to record parameters and indices related to the geometrical and landscape orientation features for the 1945-2016 period and to evaluate the ecological and environmental status of the lagoon through in-situ measurement and sample analysis. High-resolution aerial photos at a scale of 1:30,000, orthomosaics, and satellite images were used and linear regression rates (LRR) were calculated to determine the changes. Seasonal sampling of water, sediment, and macrofaunal organisms in the lagoon was performed to monitor environmental and ecological parameters. The results showed that the lagoon's water surface shrank during the 1945-2016 period, showing different rates in four segments. The shrinkage prevailed in the northeastern and southern parts of the lagoon, with rates of 17.75 and 6.46 m/year, respectively. The ecological status was determined to be poor, although nutrient input seemed to have been moderate over the study period. We conclude that applying remote sensing techniques using a combination of high-resolution images constitutes an effective and accurate method for the spatiotemporal mapping of wetlands. The ecological problems of the Kotychi Lagoon were highlighted and confirmed through complementary in-situ analyses. These problems need to be addressed by the respective managerial bodies in order to restore the lagoon to good ecological status.					; Panagiotaras, Dionisios/AHI-1877-2022; AVRAMIDIS, PAVLOS/AAA-3097-2021; DIONYSIOS, APOSTOLOPOULOS/HNQ-0892-2023; Ramfos, Alexis/AAK-8680-2021; Nikolakopoulos, Kostantinos/B-5379-2018; Avramidis, Pavlos/AAA-3097-2021; APOSTOLOPOULOS, Dr. DIONYSIOS/HNQ-0892-2023	Ramfos, Alexis/0000-0001-5916-0509; AVRAMIDIS, PAVLOS/0000-0002-8204-970X; DIONYSIOS, APOSTOLOPOULOS/0000-0003-0956-7049; nikolakopoulos, konstantinos/0000-0003-1028-9541; Panagiotaras, Dr. Dionisios/0000-0002-4393-0908; 														2077-1312				FEB	2023	11	2							411	10.3390/jmse11020411	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse11020411													WOS:000941303300001

Occurrence and seasonal dynamics of RNA viral genotypes in three contrasting temperate lakes	PLOS ONE												Decades of research have demonstrated the crucial importance of viruses in freshwater ecosystems. However, few studies have focused on the seasonal dynamics and potential hosts of RNA viruses. We surveyed microbial-sized (i.e. 5-0.2 pm) mixed community plankton transcriptomes for RNA viral genomes and investigated their distribution between microbial and macrobial plankton over a seasonal cycle across three temperate lakes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 30 contigs bearing similarity to RNA viral genomes were recovered from a global assembly of 30 plankton RNA libraries. Of these, only 13 were found in >2 libraries and recruited >100 reads (of 9.13 x 107 total reads), representing several picornaviruses, two tobamoviruses and a reovirus. We quantified the abundance of four picornaviruses and the reovirus monthly from August 2014 to May 2015. Patterns of viral abundance in the >5 pm size fraction and representation in microbial-sized community RNA libraries over time suggest that one picornavirus genotype (TS24835) and the reovirus (TS148892) may infect small (<5 pm) eukaryotic microorganisms, while two other picornaviruses (TS24641 and TS4340) may infect larger (>5 pm) eukaryotic microorganisms or metazoa. Our data also suggest that picornavirus TS152062 may originate from an allochthonous host. All five viral genotypes were present in at least one size fraction across all 3 lakes during the year, suggesting that RNA viruses may easily disperse between adjacent aquatic habitats. Our data therefore demonstrate that RNA viruses are widespread in temperate lacustrine ecosystems, and may provide evidence of viral infection in larger eukaryotes (including metazoa) inhabiting the lakes.

The distributions of labile P in sediments were measured in situ using a diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique (Zr-oxide DGT) at a two-dimensional, sub-millimeter spatial resolution. The changes of P fractions in sediments at different temperatures were also investigated using a chemical fractionation technique which divided sediment P into NH4Cl-P, BD-P, NaOH-P, HCl-P, and Residual P. The results showed that the concentrations of labile P in sediments increased rapidly as the simulating temperature increased, reflecting a rapid P release from sediments. The NaOH-P concentrations in sediments showed the greatest decrease (accounting for 79.3 % of total decrease) during the experiment, suggesting that the increase of labile P in sediments was mainly due to the transformation of NaOH-P. The release of HCl-P also occurred in sediments, increasing the labile P concentration in pore waters. The seasonal variation of temperature and its induced biological-chemical changes at the sediment-water interface (such as organic matter degradation, and respiration) might be an important factor affecting the P release in sediments of Hongfeng Lake. Our results provide new information for illuminating P biogeochemical cycling processes at the interface in eutrophic lakes.

J	Metcalfe, JZ; Longstaffe, FJ				Metcalfe, Jessica Z.; Longstaffe, Fred J.			Mammoth tooth enamel growth rates inferred from stable isotope analysis and histology	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Mammoth (Mammuthus sp.) teeth are relatively abundant in Quaternary deposits from Eurasia and North America, and their isotopic compositions can be used to reconstruct past seasonal patterns in precipitation, diet, and migration. Strategies for collecting and interpreting such data, however, are strongly dependent on growth rates, which can vary among species, individuals, and within teeth. In this study, we use histological and isotopic measurements to determine enamel growth rates for a Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) tooth in two directions. Using histology, the growth rate through the enamel thickness (ET; perpendicular to the height of the tooth) is estimated at 0.8 to 1.5 mm/yr. Isotopic sampling through the innermost 0.36 mm of the ET recovered less than half a period of variation (i.e., half an inferred year of growth), which is consistent with the histological estimate for ET growth rate. A combination of histological and isotopic measurements suggests that the enamel extension rate (growth in the height of the tooth) is 13-14 mm/yr. Knowledge of enamel growth rates should improve the design and interpretation of future isotopic studies of mammoth teeth. The combination of histological and isotopic measurements may also prove useful in determining growth rates for other extinct taxa. (C) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Variability in ice phenology on Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, from SeaWinds/QuikSCAT: 2000-2006	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The temporal evolution of the backscatter coefficient, sigma-nought (sigma degrees) from QuikSCAT was evaluated for monitoring ice phenology on Great Bear Lake (66 degrees N, 121 degrees W) and Great Slave Lake (61 degrees 40'N, 114 degrees W), Northwest Territories, Canada. Results indicated that sigma degrees from QuikSCAT can be used to detect melt onset, water clear of ice and freeze onset dates on both lakes. An ice phenology algorithm was then developed to assess the spatiotemporal variability on both lakes from QuikSCAT for the period 2000-2006. Results showed that for Great Slave Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on year day (YD) 123, the average water clear of ice date was on YD164, and the average freeze onset date was on YD330. On Great Bear Lake, the average melt onset date occurred on YD139, the average water clear of ice date was YD191, and the average freeze onset date was YD321. Ice cover remained present for at least five weeks longer on Great Bear Lake than on Great Slave Lake and most of the difference can be explained by earlier ice melt on Great Slave Lake. Spatially, on Great Bear Lake, melt onset took place first in the eastern arm, water clear of ice occurred first in southeastern and western arms, and freeze onset appeared first in the northern arm and along the shorelines. On Great Slave Lake, melt onset began first in the central basin and then progressed to the northern and eastern arms later in the season. The central basin of Great Slave Lake cleared earlier than the periphery due to the discharge from the Slave River. Freeze onset on Great Slave Lake occurred first within the east arm, closely followed by the north and west arms, and then finally in the centre of the main basin. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

They are consumed locally, traded for maize, or sold, eventually entering the folk markets of Cusco and other neighboring cities. Throughout highland Peru, Nostoc commune is highly salient as a seasonal dietary item, being eaten alone, or in picante - a local stew - and is said to be highly nutritious. Nostoc commune has been known to produce unusual amino acids, including those of the mycosporine group, which possibly function to prevent UV damage. We analyzed 21 different Nostoc commune spherical colonies from 7 different market collections in the Cusco area for the presence of beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxic amino acid produced by diverse taxa of cyanobacteria, using four different analytical techniques (HPLC-FD, UPLC-UV, UPLC/MS, LC/MS/MS). We found using all four techniques that BMAA was present in the samples purchased in the Peruvian markets. Since BMAA has been putatively linked to neurodegenerative illness, it would be of interest to know if the occurrence of ALS, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's Disease is greater among individuals who consume llullucha in Peru.

For local organisms, this leads to drastic changes in the availability of resources, breaks down the co-existence of species, and reshuffles the local ecosystem. West Lake is a freshwater lake with resource patchiness caused by multiple exogenous disturbances that has strong environmental heterogeneity that prevents clear observation of seasonal changes in the microbial communities. Despite this, the emergence of rhythmic species in response to irregular changes in the environment has been helpful for observing microbial communities dynamics in patchy ecosystems. We investigated the ecological mechanisms of seasonal changes in microbial communities in West Lake by screening rhythmic species based on the ecological niche and modern coexistence theories. The results showed that rhythmic species were the dominant factors in microbial community changes and the effects of most environmental factors on the microbial community were indirectly realised through the rhythmic species. Random forest analyses showed that seasonal changes in the microbial community were similarly predicted by the rhythmic species. In addition, we incorporated species interactions and community phylogenetic patterns into stepwise multiple regression analyses, the results of which indicate that ecological niches and species fitness may drive the coexistence of these subcommunities. Thus, this study extends our understanding of seasonal changes in microbial communities and provides new ways for observing seasonal changes in microbial communities, especially in ecosystems with resource patches. Our study also show that combining community phylogenies with co-occurrence networks based on ecological niches and modern coexistence theory can further help us understand the ecological mechanisms of interspecies coexistence.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JUN 1	2024	256								121626	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121626		APR 2024						38642534					WOS:001232023900001

The CFD model was used to predict the wind field over the lake surface which served as the meteorological forcing for the lake model. The study was carried out for the Marina Reservoir in downtown Singapore where field measurements of the wind field showed that temporal and spatial differences in wind field were found to be significant. By comparing simulations using uniform and spatially variable wind inputs in terms of thermal stratification, Richardson number, vorticity, and spatial gradients, this study demonstrates that the variability in wind forcing in urban lakes that arise from shielding and seasonal effects can have significant impacts on the hydrodynamics and water quality in the reservoir.

J	Gonçalves, HC; Mercante, MA; Santos, ET				Goncalves, H. C.; Mercante, M. A.; Santos, E. T.			Hydrological cycle	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The Pantanal hydrological cycle holds an important meaning in the Alto Paraguay Basin, comprising two areas with considerably diverse conditions regarding natural and water resources: the Plateau and the Plains. From the perspective of the ecosystem function, the hydrological flow in the relationship between plateau and plains is important for the creation of reproductive and feeding niches for the regional biodiversity. In general, river declivity in the plateau is 0.6 m/km while declivity on the plains varies from 0.1 to 0.3 m/km. The environment in the plains is characteristically seasonal and is home to an exuberant and abundant diversity of species, including some animals threatened with extinction. When the flat surface meets the plains there is a diminished water flow on the riverbeds and, during the rainy season the rivers overflow their banks, flooding the lowlands. Average annual precipitation in the Basin is 1,396 mm, ranging from 800 mm to 1,600 mm, and the heaviest rainfall occurs in the plateau region. The low drainage capacity of the rivers and lakes that shape the Pantanal, coupled with the climate in the region, produce very high evaporation: approximately 60% of all the waters coming from the plateau are lost through evaporation. The Alto Paraguay Basin, including the Pantanal, while boasting an abundant availability of water resources, also has some spots with water scarcity in some sub-basins, at different times of the year. Climate conditions alone are not enough to explain the differences observed in the Paraguay River regime and some of its tributaries. The complexity of the hydrologic regime of the Paraguay River is due to the low declivity of the lands that comprise the Mato Grosso plains and plateau (50 to 30 cm/km from east to west and 3 to 1.5 cm/km from north to south) as well as the area's dimension, which remains periodically flooded with a large volume of water.

J	Mishra, V; Cherkauer, KA; Bowling, LC; Huber, M				Mishra, Vimal; Cherkauer, Keith A.; Bowling, Laura C.; Huber, Matthew			Lake Ice phenology of small lakes: Impacts of climate variability in the Great Lakes region	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Formation of lake ice is common in lakes located in mid and high latitudes. Lake ice plays a vital role in heat storage, controlling lake water temperature, survival of aquatic ecosystems, and maintaining the bio diversity of lakes. Significant warming in air temperature during the cold season (October-May) may lead to reduced ice cover of lakes and eventually disturb the lake's seasonal dynamics. We examined the role of climate variability on lake ice phenology for small inland lakes in the Great Lakes region. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with a physically based lake algorithm was implemented to simulate long term (i.e. 1916-2007) changes in lake ice phenology, as described by the date of ice break-up, date of ice freeze-up, and number of ice-free days. Model performance was evaluated against observed lake ice phenology. A statistically significant increase (0.08-0.21 degrees C) in air temperature resulted in a significant change (0.2-2.0 days/decade) in lake ice freeze-up and break-up dates. While lake ice freeze-up was strongly associated (correlation > 0.60) with air temperature of the early (October-December) cold season, lake ice break-up was highly associated (correlation = -0.80) with air temperature during the late (March-May) cold season. The number of ice-free days was affected by the temperature changes during the entire cold season. Lakes located in the southern part of the study domain experienced stronger trends in ice phenology than those located in the northern part. Inter-decadal to decadal scale variability in the number of ice-free days not associated with long-term trends in air temperature were largely driven by the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Methane release from wetlands and watercourses in Europe	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This Study was conducted to estimate annual CH4 efflux from wetlands and watercourses in Europe and some adjacent areas. Wet ecosystems were divided into seven categories: ombrotrophic mires, minerotrophic mires, freshwater marshes, saltwater marshes, small lakes, large lakes and rivers. The geographical distribution and total area coverage for each of these respective ecosystems were taken from CORINE 2000, Global Land Cover 2000 [JRC, 2003. Harmonisation, mosaicing and production of the Global Land Cover 2000 database (Beta Version). EUR 20849 EN, Joint Research Center, Ispra, Italy] and ESRI] 2003 databases. CH4 release factors were obtained from an extensive overview of published literature. Less than 3% of the study area of 22,560,000 km(2) consisted of wetlands and watercourses. Large lakes (40%), minerotrophic mires (24%) and ombrotrophic mires (20%) covered almost 85% of the total area of wetlands and watercourses. The total CH4 release from European wetlands and Watercourses was estimated to be 5.2 Tg a(-1). CH4 release from minerotrophic mires (48%), large lakes (24%), and ombrotrophic mires (12%) composed most of the total CH4 efflux. High variation in the rate of CH4 release within the main ecosystem types, small number of studies in some ecosystems and ecologically inadequate land-cover classification are the main reasons for the uncertainties of the estimate. A better estimation of European CH4 effluxes from natural Sources, now and future, Would require: a Much more detailed and ecologically relevant mapping of the area of different types of wetlands and watercourses, and long-term measurements of CH4 fluxes and their controlling environmental factors in poorly studied types of wetlands and watercourses. Finally, the data could be used for dynamic modelling of CH4 fluxes in the current and changing environmental conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, anthropogenic impacts in populated area are migrating to these remote areas via transporting particulate nutrients by atmospheric deposition. Whether warming and nutrient deposition would impose additive or synergistic effects on the lake ecosystem remains largely unknown. Here, we present multi-proxy (sediment pigment and geochemistry) records during the past two centuries at the Cuoqia Lake in the southeast Tibetan Plateau. We found that the lake exhibited rapid ecological changes since 1980 AD characterized by an increase in primary productivity due to algal proliferation, with more rapid growth of green algae and diatoms. These findings are in concert with many other lakes (e.g., Moon Lake and Shade Co) in the same area, suggesting a consistent pattern of ecosystem evolution at the region scale. Statistical analyses suggested that nutrient deposition and climate warming were strongly associated with the variations in primary productivity and algae composition, exerting both individual and interactive effects. In addition, scenario analyses with a well-established process-based ecosystem model further revealed that the two factors not only individually, but also synergistically promoted the algal proliferation and community succession. Such synergy is evident in that the effect of lake warming would be more pronounced under higher nutrient deposition scenario, which is potentially due to higher temperature-driven mineralization in warmer conditions, and higher efficiency of nutrient utilization under enhanced light availability attributing to declining ice thickness and duration in cold seasons. Overall, our study proposes the existence and quantifies the synergistic impacts of climate warming and anthropogenic activities in driving the ecological changes in remote alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The lake ecological consequences driven by individual factor would be worsen by such synergy, so that we cannot predict the lake ecosystem trajectory in the future based on each factor separately, and more efforts than previously expected would be needed for the lake restoration and management.

J	Yihdego, Y; Webb, J; Leahy, P				Yihdego, Yohannes; Webb, John; Leahy, Paul			Modelling water and salt balances in a deep, groundwater-throughflow lake-Lake Purrumbete, southeastern Australia	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Lake Purrumbete is a deep volcanic freshwater lake, cylindrical in shape, located within an extensive basalt plain in southeastern Australia. A modified difference water budget method for lakes, that estimates net groundwater flux through the difference between the level of the lake and the water table, along with the specific yield and area of the aquifer, successfully modelled the lake level fluctuations. The major influences are evaporation and direct precipitation; however groundwater fluxes are significant (similar to 17%). The salt balance modelling shows that the salinity in Lake Purrumbete is largely controlled by groundwater and surface water fluxes. Lake Purrumbete has a greater interaction with the surrounding groundwater system than other nearby volcanic lakes due to its significant depth and the presence of highly permeable basalts along the upgradient shoreline. Its low salinity reflects the substantial salt export in the groundwater and surface outflow, as well as the lake's relatively small evaporation due to the low surface area/volume ratio. The fluctuations in lake level and salinity for Lake Purrumbete are much less than for other lakes in the region, even during the 1997-2010 drought, due partly to the large, relatively constant groundwater flux. Low salinity, deep water and estimated depth of stratification from this study, which leads to a distinct limnology, implies that the creatures need to adapt to a different habitat to survive in the vicinity of Lake Purrumbete. Thus, Lake Purrumbete will be an important aquatic ecosystem refugium if climate change causes frequent seasonal drying of other lakes in the plain, and it is important to develop management strategies to maintain its water resources and quality.

A multi-disciplinary perspective on habitat preferences among dinosaurs in a Cretaceous Arctic greenhouse world, North Slope, Alaska (Prince Creek Formation: lower Maastrichtian)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Prince Creek Formation of northern Alaska is the most abundant source of polar dinosaur remains in the world, and now, corroborating data from this well-studied rock unit allow for making inferences about the paleoecological preferences for these extinct polar animals. The rock unit records high-latitude, alluvial sedimentation and soil formation on a low-gradient, muddy coastal plain. Compound and cumulative andic Entisols and Inceptisols formed on levees, point bars, crevasse splays, and along the margins of floodplain lakes, ponds, and swamps. Abundant organic matter, carbonaceous root traces, Fe-oxide depletion coatings, and zoned peds indicate periodic waterlogging, anoxia, and gleying, consistent with a high water table. In contrast, Fe-oxide mottles, ferruginous and manganiferous segregations, bioturbation, and less common illuvial clay coatings indicate recurring oxidation and periodic drying out of some soils. An integrated reconstruction of pedogenic processes and biota suggests that this ancient Arctic coastal plain was influenced by seasonally fluctuating water table levels and floods, and in distal areas, marine waters. Four of the five bonebeds in this study are from more distal areas, represented by lower delta plain facies, while the fifth bonebed is from a more proximal part of the basin, represented by a somewhat better drained coastal plain facies. Bonebeds in the distal areas are dominated by Edmontosaurus sp. while the more proximal bonebed is dominated by the remains of the ceratopsian Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum. The distribution of these bonebeds, sedimentological facies, paleosols, and biota suggests that Pachyrhinosaurus may have preferred more upland environments while Edmontosaurus preferred lowland, deltaic environments. This distribution may be the result of physiological adaptation to the pronounced seasonality provided by polar terrestrial ecosystems. In contrast to a preferred habitat distribution of these large herbivores, the large predatory dinosaur Nanugsaurus hoglundi seems to have had a more ubiquitous distribution across the landscape.

Sedimentary facies analysis and depositional model of gravity-flow deposits of the Yanchang Formation, southwestern Ordos Basin, NW China	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												During the deposition of the Chang-7 (Ch-7) and Chang-6 (Ch-6) units in the Upper Triassic, gravity flows were developed widely in a deep lake in the southwestern Ordos Basin, China. Based on cores, outcrops, well-logs and well-testing data, this paper documents the sedimentary characteristics of the gravity-flow deposits and constructs a depositional model. Gravity-flow deposits in the study area comprise seven lithofacies types, which are categorised into four groups: slides and slumps, debris-flow-dominated lithofacies, turbidity-current-dominated lithofacies, and deep-water mudstone-dominated lithofacies. The seven lithofacies form two sedimentary entities: sub-lacustrine fan and the slump olistolith, made up of three and two lithofacies associations, respectively. Lithofacies association 1 is a channel-levee complex with fining-/thinning-upward sequences whose main part is characterised by sandy debris flow-dominated, thick-bedded massive sandstones. Lithofacies association 2 represents distributary channelised lobes of sub-lacustrine fans, which can be further subdivided into distributary channel, channel lateral margin and inter-channel. Lithofacies association 3 is marked by non-channelised lobes of sub-lacustrine fans, including sheet-like turbidites and deep-lake mudstones. Lithofacies association 4 is represented by proximal lobes of slump olistolith, consisting of slides and slumps. Lithofacies association 5 is marked by distal lobes of slump olistolith, comprising tongue-shaped debris flow lobes and turbidite lobes. It is characterised by sandy debris flow, muddy debris flow-dominated sandstone and sandstone with classic Bouma sequences. Several factors caused the generation of gravity flows in the Ordos Basin, including sediment supply, terrain slope and external triggers, such as volcanisms, earthquakes and seasonal floods. The sediment supply of sub-lacustrine fan was most likely from seasonal floods with a high net-to-gross and incised channels. Triggered by volcanisms and earthquakes, the slump olistolith is deposited by the slumping and secondary transport of unconsolidated sediments in the delta front or prodelta with a low net-to-gross and no incised channels.

Sediment concentration rating curves for a monsoonal climate: upper Blue Nile	SOIL												Information on sediment concentration in rivers is important for design of reservoirs and for environmental applications. Because of the scarcity of continuous sediment data, methods have been developed to predict sediment loads based on few discontinuous measurements. Traditionally, loads are being predicted using rating curves that relate sediment load to discharge. The relationship assumes inherently a unique relationship between concentration and discharge and therefore although performing satisfactorily in predicting loads, it may be less suitable for predicting concentration. This is especially true in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia where concentrations decrease for a given discharge with the progression of the rainy monsoon phase. The objective of this paper is to improve the sediment concentration predictions throughout the monsoon period for the Ethiopian highlands with a modified rating type equation. To capture the observed sediment concentration pattern, we assume that the sediment concentration was at the transport limit early in the rainy season and then decreases linearly with effective rainfall towards source-limited concentration. The modified concentration rating curve was calibrated for the four main rivers in the Lake Tana basin where sediment concentrations affect fish production and tourism. Then the scalability of the rating type equation was checked in three 100 ha watersheds for which historic data were available. The results show that for predicting sediment concentrations, the (modified) concentration rating curve was more accurate than the (standard) load rating curve as expected. In addition loads were predicted more accurately for three of the four rivers. We expect that after more extensive testing over a wider geographical area, the proposed concentration rating curve will offer improved predictions of sediment concentrations in monsoonal climates.

The deaths of these two terrapin species were observed during a bloom of Microcystis spp. The total microcystin content per phytoplankton biomass evaluated with the methanol extraction-protein phosphatase methodology was 1.12mg MCYST-LR equivalents/g dried bloom material. The analysis of this bloom extract by the LC/MS technique demonstrated the presence of three microcystin variants: microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR), microcystin-YR (MCYST-YR), and microcystin-RR (MCYST-RR). Microcystins were also detected in fresh carcasses of terrapin liver, viscera and muscle tissues using the GC/MS after Lemieux oxidation method and the PP2A inhibition assay. The high level of microcystins detected using the Lemieux oxidation-GC/MS method in the liver tissue (1192.8 mu g MCYST-LR equivalent/g dw) and in the viscera tissue (37.19 mu g MCYST-LR equivalent/g dw) of the species M. leprosa and E orbicularis, respectively, and the liver crumbling observed after the necropsy examination of the fresh carcass of M. leprosa support the possibility that cyanobacterial microcystins contribute to the turtle mortalities.

Skewed adult sex ratios observed early in the North American invasion of Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae)	JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY												The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma dehcatula, (Hemiptera Fulgoridae) is an invasive pest in Korea and the United States, but originating from mainland Asia. Both tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima, and grapevine (Vitis) are known to be preferred hosts of adults. However, much is unknown about its adult behavior with respect to mating or dispersal patterns. In 2015, just after it was discovered in the United States, we performed an observational study to elucidate movement by adults in relation to host plants. We noted weekly changes in their presence and sex ratio on host plants at four sites in a quarantine zone in Berks County, PA. Just after adult emergence, the trunks of large ( > 15 cm diameter at breast height) A. altissima hosted nearly exclusively females, while smaller A. altissima, Vitis, Salix nigra, and other less commonly inhabited tree species, had high proportions of males. By October 1st, greater proportions of males were observed on the trunks of the larger A. altissima trees. Pairings of males and females were observed most frequently on the smaller A. altissima and Vitis. At the very end of the season, a large mixed-sex population was found on Salix nigra, which was the only deciduous tree species in the area still bearing green leaves.

Despite the crucial role of ocean inflow in the climate system, less is known about its predictability, variability, and connectivity to cryospheric and climatic patterns on different time scales. In this study, multi-scale variation modes were decomposed from observed daily and monthly snowcover and river flows to improve the predictability of Arctic Ocean inflows from the Mackenzie River Basin in Canada. Two multi-linear regression and Bayesian neural network models were used with different combinations of remotely sensed snowcover, in-situ inflow observations, and climatic teleconnection patterns as predictors. The results showed that daily and monthly ocean inflows are associated positively with decadal snowcover fluctuations and negatively with interannual snowcover fluctuations. Interannual snowcover and antecedent flow oscillations have a more important role in describing the variability of ocean inflows than seasonal snowmelt and large-scale climatic teleconnection. Both models forecasted inflows seven months in advance with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency score of approximate to 0.8. The proposed methodology can be used to assess the variability of the freshwater input to northern oceans, affecting thermohaline and atmospheric circulations.					; Rasouli, Kabir/ABD-5190-2020; Mahmood, Taufique/ABB-8369-2020; Haghighi, Ali/AAE-6862-2021	Nasri, Bouchra R./0000-0001-6334-3105; Mahmood, Taufique/0000-0003-1198-9603; Rasouli, Kabir/0000-0002-8176-2132; Soleymani, Armina/0000-0002-2763-7525; , Masahiro/0000-0002-9729-7909													1998-9563	2224-7955				JUN	2020	51	3					541	561		10.2166/nh.2020.164	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2020.164													WOS:000540590800011

Previous studies suggested that the high ecological value depends on correlations between ecosystem functionality and seasonal inundation control vegetation patches. However, the knowledge on how river morphodynamics and its complex erosion-depositional processes influence the aquatic mosaic and fishing activity in the region is still incipient. This study examines the hydrogeomorphology of the Peruvian tropical wetland of Pacaya Samiria, located in Western Amazonia, and its role in the distribution of aquatic habitats. By using remote sensing techniques, the hydrogeomorphological connectivity that bounds the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve is characterized by ancient to modern river processes. Additionally, river signatures developed by the Ucayali, Maranon, Huallaga, Pacaya, and Samiria Rivers overlap with fish extraction and dominant vegetation to describe how geomorphology is associated with the spatial distribution of fishing zones. Results indicated that paleochannels regulate wetland drainage within the Ucamara Depression, supporting stational water stagnation, vegetation cover, and formation of carbon rich detritus, relevant aspects to understand fish traits. Moreover, the Ucayali River dominates river dynamics in the Pacaya Samiria wetland, thus playing a pivotal role in shaping the complexity of streams and lakes. Furthermore, underfit-scavenger meandering rivers are observed in areas where paleochannels from large rivers are found. A geomorphological characterization of drainage patterns in freshwater environments, such as Amazonian wetlands, is crucial to develop sound management strategies. This methodological approach is expected to support decision-making in conservation actions in Amazonian environments based on understanding wetland connectivity and hydrogeomorphological behavior and their influence on commercial fisheries.

Structure of bacterial and eukaryote communities reflect in situ controls on community assembly in a high-alpine lake	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Recent work suggests that microbial community composition in high-elevation lakes is significantly influenced by microbes entering from upstream terrestrial and aquatic habitats. To test this idea, we conducted 18S and 16S rDNA surveys of microbial communities in a high-alpine lake in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. We compared the microbial community of the lake to water entering the lake and to uphill soils that drain into the lake. Utilizing hydrological and abiotic data, we identified potential factors controlling microbial diversity and community composition. Results show a diverse community entering the lake at the inlet with a strong resemblance to uphill terrestrial and aquatic communities. In contrast, the lake communities (water column and outlet) showed significantly lower diversity and were significantly different from the inlet communities. Assumptions of neutral community assembly poorly predicted community differences between the inlet and lake, whereas "variable selection" and "dispersal limitation" were predicted to dominate. Similarly, the lake communities were correlated with discharge rate, indicating that longer hydraulic residence times limit dispersal, allowing selective pressures within the lake to structure communities. Sulfate and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations correlated with community composition, indicating "bottom up" controls on lake community assembly. Furthermore, bacterial community composition was correlated with both zooplankton density and eukaryotic community composition, indicating biotic controls such as "top-down" interactions also contribute to community assembly in the lake. Taken together, these community analyses suggest that deterministic biotic and abiotic selection within the lake coupled with dispersal limitation structures the microbial communities in Green Lake 4.

Variation in Acer saccharum Marshall (Sugar Maple) Bark and Stemflow Characteristics: Implications for Epiphytic Bryophyte Communities	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Past studies have demonstrated successions of epiphyte communities on trees of progressively larger diameters, suggesting the existence of temporal resource-gradients associated with aging/growing phorophyte hosts. The objective of this study was to identify possible resource gradients associated with the diameter/age of Acer saccharum (Sugar Maple) in northern New York. We determined epiphytic bryophyte cover by species on 102 Sugar Maples (min-max = 11-84 cm diameter at breast height) from 12 Adirondack northern hardwood forest stands. We extracted a 12.6-cm(2) bark sample from each tree to analyze in the laboratory for moisture-holding capacity, surface-moisture availability, drying rates, and leachate cation and nitrogen concentrations. We collected throughfall and stemflow from 15 trees (19-79 cm dbh) at a separate site over the course of a growing season and analyzed samples for cation and nitrogen concentrations. Bark mass per unit surface area (g cm(-2)) was positively correlated with tree diameter, reflecting increasing bark thickness with age. Bark moisture-holding capacity (H2O as % dry mass) was independent of tree diameter, but bark surface-moisture availability (g H2O cm(-2) bark) increased with diameter as a result of thickening bark. Bark drying rates were negatively correlated with bark mass (thickness). Cation (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) concentrations in bark leachate were all positively correlated with tree diameter, but NH4+ and DON concentrations varied independently of tree diameter, and NO3- concentrations were typically below detection limits. Stemflow became enriched 10- to 20-fold with dissolved cations but not with dissolved nitrogen. Percent cover of several mesophytic and calciphilic epiphytes (e.g., Anomodon rugelii, Brachythecium laetum, Neckera pennata, and Porella platyphylla) were positively correlated with cation concentration in bark leachate, bark thickness, and moisture availability, and negatively correlated with bark drying rate. The results of this study are consistent with hypotheses that increased moisture and nutrient availability and slower drying rates of bark on large-diameter trees may account for increasing total cover and species richness of bryophtyes and increasing dominance of mesophytic and calciphilic bryophytes on larger trees. We extend McCune's similar gradient hypothesis with an analogous set of nutrient-based gradients, and offer an alternative mechanism for McCune's original time-based moisture gradient.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				MAR	2019	26	1					214	235																WOS:000470721400018

Suspended matter, nutrients, chlorophyll, light, and zooplankton composition and biomass were compared between dense and sparse submerged vegetation at two sites five times during the vegetation period of 2013. Water transparency was relatively high (light attenuation around 1 m(-1)), and nutrient concentrations moderate (TP around 1.1 mu mol L-1, TN around 35 mu mol L-1) during the study period. Submerged vegetation was dominated by Ruppia cirrhosa, Stockenia pea:Mara and non-attached Focus vesiculosus, and reached high cover in the "dense vegetation" plots, but only low PVI (= plant volume inhabited) values due to low height. Contrary to our expectations and numerous investigations in freshwater lakes, we did not find significant differences between dense and sparse vegetation for any parameter investigated. During all sampling occasions, copepods dominated zooplankton biomass. Zooplankton biomass was higher at night than at daytime both in dense and sparse vegetation during most sampling occasions. We conclude that PVI was too low to allow for strong plant impact on the environment, and that high water exchange rates in this shallow coastal lagoon may override the impact of submerged macrophytes on transparency. Our results indicate that phytoplankton was not limited by light, but by nutrients and zooplankton, and that zooplankton performs diurnal vertical migration and uses the dense vegetation layer straight above the sediment surface as daytime refuge.

J	Naselli-Flores, L; Barone, R				Naselli-Flores, Luigi; Barone, Rossella			Mixotrophic phytoplankton dynamics in a shallow Mediterranean water body: how to make a virtue out of necessity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mixotrophy is a combination of photosynthesis and direct access to organic carbon sources, mainly through osmotrophy or phagotrophy. This strategy is adopted by several, phylogenetically distinct, phytoplankton groups and is commonly occurring in marine, brackish and freshwater ecosystems. Traditionally, it has been put in relation to both scarcity of inorganic nutrients and poor light conditions. However, we observed blooms of the mixotrophic, toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum in different periods of the year and under variable resources availability. The analysis of a 6.5-year data set of phytoplankton weekly records from a Sicilian shallow lake (Biviere di Gela, south-eastern Sicily) allowed us to hypothesise that a depleted condition as regards inorganic nutrients is not the main fuel to the growth of P. parvum, neither this is due to light limitation. The results achieved show that an increased availability in suitable preys can stimulate the growth of this phagotrophic photoautotroph. Contemporarily, it was not found any clear environmental patterns to explain species dominance and growth patterns as related to inorganic nutrient availability. Moreover, it is shown that these organisms tend to monopolise resources when these become available irrespective of seasons, and under variable conditions as regards inorganic nutrient availability.

Abrupt climate change as an important agent of ecological change in the Northeast US throughout the past 15,000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Biennial Meeting of the American-Quaternary-Association	JUN, 2008	Pennsylvania State Univ, University Pk, PA	Amer Quaternary Assoc, UNESCO Int Goesci Programme	Pennsylvania State Univ			We use a series of tests to evaluate two competing hypotheses about the association of climate and vegetation trends in the northeastern United States over the past 15 kyrs. First, that abrupt climate changes on the scale of centuries had little influence on long-term vegetation trends, and second, that abrupt climate changes interacted with slower climate trends to determine the regional sequence of vegetation phases. Our results support the second. Large dissimilarity between temporally close fossil pollen samples indicates large vegetation changes within 500 years across >4 degrees of latitude at ca 13.25-12.75, 12.0-11.5, 10.5, 8.25, and 5.25 ka. The evidence of vegetation change coincides with independent isotopic and sedimentary indicators of rapid shifts in temperature and moisture balance. In several cases, abrupt changes reversed long-term vegetation trends, such as when spruce (Picea) and pine (Pinus) pollen percentages rapidly declined to the north and increased to the south at ca 13.25-12.75 and 8.25 ka respectively. Abrupt events accelerated other long-term trends, such as a regional increase in beech (Fagus) pollen percentages at 8.5-8.0 ka. The regional hemlock (Tsuga) decline at ca 5.25 ka is unique among the abrupt events, and may have been induced by high climatic variability (i.e., repeated severe droughts from 5.7 to 2.0 ka); autoregressive ecological and evolutionary processes could have maintained low hemlock abundance until ca 2.0 ka. Delayed increases in chestnut (Castanea) pollen abundance after 5.8 and 2.5 ka also illustrate the potential for multi-century climate variability to influence species' recruitment as well as mortality. Future climate changes will probably also rapidly initiate persistent vegetation change, particularly by acting as broad, regional-scale disturbances. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Then compared with size-matched conspecific grown artificially (tank carp) and an advanced omnivore species possessing true stomach (tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus). Results suggested activities of digestive enzymes (except amylolytic) were significantly higher in pond carp (p <= 0.05) than in the size-matched tank carp. Even compared to tilapia, pond carp appeared superior (p < 0.05; proteolytic or chitinolytic activities) or comparable (p > 0.05; phosphatase or cellulolytic activities). Amylolytic, chitinolytic, and phosphatases activities in pond carp gut significantly increased (p <= 0.01) over season. Several orders-of-magnitude higher enzymatic activities were detected in planktonic natural food than expressed in carp gut. Amino acid markers in planktonic food revealed a higher share of zooplankton (microcrustaceans), but not phytoplankton, synchronized with higher activities of complex polysaccharide-splitting enzymes (cellulolytic and chitinolytic) in fish gut. Periods of clear water phase low in chlorophyll-a and nutrients, but high in certain zooplankton (preferably cladocerans), may create a synergistic digestibility effect in pond carp. We conclude aquatic ecosystem components (natural food, water, microbiota) enhance fishes' hydrolyzing capabilities of C/N/P macromolecules and even their complex polymers such as cellulose, chitin, and maybe phytate (to be validated), to the extent that being stomachless is not an issue. Aquatic nutritional ecologists may consider that laboratory-based understandings of digestibility may underestimate digestion efficiency of free-ranging fish in ponds or lakes.

(Volvocales, Chlorophyta) causes green surface blooms in the high tatras (Slovakia) and tolerates high irradiance	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Seasonally slowly melting mountain snowfields are populated by extremophilic microalgae. In alpine habitats, high-light sensitive, green phytoflagellates are usually observed in subsurface layers deeper in the snowpack under dim conditions, while robust orange to reddish cyst stages can be seen exposed on the surface. In this study, uncommon surface green snow was investigated in the High Tatra Mountains (Slovakia). The monospecific community found in the green surface bloom consisted of vegetative Chloromonas cells (Volvocales, Chlorophyta). Molecular data demonstrated that the field sample and the strain isolated and established from the bloom were conspecific, and they represent a new species, Chloromonas kaweckae sp. nov., which is described based on the morphology of the vegetative cells and asexual reproduction and on molecular analyses of the strain. Cells of C. kaweckae accumulated approximately 50% polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is advantageous at low temperatures. In addition, this new species performed active photosynthesis at temperatures close to the freezing point showed a light compensation point of 126 & PLUSMN; 22 mu mol photons & BULL; m(-2) & BULL; s(-1) and some signs of photoinhibition at irradiances greater than 600 mu mol photons & BULL; m(-2) & BULL; s(-1).

Sensitivity analysis of lake mass balance in discontinuous permafrost: the example of disappearing Twelvemile Lake, Yukon Flats, Alaska (USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Many lakes in northern high latitudes have undergone substantial changes in surface area over the last four decades, possibly as a result of climate warming. In the discontinuous permafrost of Yukon Flats, interior Alaska (USA), these changes have been non-uniform across adjacent watersheds, suggesting local controls on lake water budgets. Mechanisms that could explain the decreasing mass of one lake in Yukon Flats since the early 1980s, Twelvemile Lake, are identified via a scoping analysis that considers plausible changes in snowmelt mass and infiltration, permafrost distribution, and climate warming. Because predicted changes in evaporation (2 cmyr(-1)) are inadequate to explain the observed 17.5 cmyr(-1) reduction in mass balance, other mechanisms are required. The most important potential mechanisms are found to involve: (1) changes in shallow, lateral groundwater flow to the lake possibly facilitated by vertical freeze-thaw migration of the permafrost table in gravel; (2) increased loss of lake water as downward groundwater flow through an open talik to a permeable subpermafrost flowpath; and (3) reduced snow meltwater inputs due to decreased snowpack mass and increased infiltration of snowmelt into, and subsequent evaporation from, fine-grained sediment mantling the permafrost-free lake basin.

Bulk atmospheric deposition samples were collected two-weekly, from February 2007 to January 2008, at three representative areas, one suburban and two urbanized, in the subtropical city, Guangzhou, China, to assess the deposition fluxes and seasonal variations of phthalate esters (PAEs). Sixteen PAE congeners in bulk deposition samples were measured and the depositional fluxes Of Sigma(16)PAEs ranged from 3.41 to 190 mu g m(-2) day(-1), and were highly affected by local anthropogenic activities. The significant relationship between PAEs and particulate depositional fluxes (correlation coefficient R(2) = 0.72, P < 0.001) showed PAEs are associated primarily with particles. Temporal flux variations of PAEs were influenced by seasonal changes in meteorological parameters, and the deposition fluxes of PAEs were obviously higher in wet season than in dry season. Diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) dominated the PAE pattern in bulk depositions, which is consistent with a high consumption of the plasticizer market in China. PAE profiles in bulk deposition showed similarities exhibited in both time and space, and a weak increase of high molecular weight PAE (HMW PAE) contribution in the wet season compared to those in the dry season. Average atmospheric deposition fluxes of PAEs in the present study were significantly higher than those from other studies, reflecting strong anthropogenic inputs as a consequence of rapid industrial and urban development in the region.

Recovery from acidification (reduced SO4 deposition) and long-term changes in runoff as potential drivers for the trends were examined. The results showed that TOC concentrations have increased throughout Finland. Ten of the 13 lakes showed a significant increasing TOC trend (p < 0.05), and included both clear water and humic lakes. The largest annual increase in TOC occurred in lakes with the largest average concentrations. The magnitude of the TOC trends were not significantly related to the proportion of peat soils in the catchment but the catchment size was an important predictor. Decreasing SO4 deposition and improved acid-base status in soil due to the recovery from acidification implied an increased mobilisation of organic acids and TOC. There was little evidence that the long-term increasing trend in TOC concentrations was related to long-term changes in runoff. However, large seasonal and interannual fluctuations in runoff did appear to affect TOC concentrations for a number of years. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although CH4 emissions during ice thaw are important and highly variable in high-latitude freshwater ponds and lakes (north of similar to 50 degrees N), their contribution is seldom included in estimates of aquatic-atmospheric CH4 exchange across different alpine ecosystems. Here, we characterized annual CH4 emissions, including emissions during ice thaw, from ponds and lakes across four alpine vegetation zones in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) permafrost region. We observed significant spatial variability in annual CH4 emission rates (8.44-421.05 mmol m-2 yr-1), CH4 emission rates during ice thaw (0.26-144.39 mmol m-2 yr-1), and the contribution of CH4 emissions during ice thaw to annual emissions (3-33%) across different vegetation zones. Dissolved oxygen concentration under ice, along with substrate availability and water salinity, played critical roles in influencing CH4 flux during ice thaw. We estimated annual CH4 emissions from ponds and lakes in the QTP permafrost region as 0.04 (0.03-0.05) Tg CH4 yr-1 (median (first quartile-third quartile)), with approximately 20% occurring during ice thaw. Notably, the average areal CH4 emission rate from ponds and lakes in the QTP permafrost region amounts to only 8% of that from high-latitude waterbodies, primarily due to the dominance of large saline lakes with lower CH4 emission rates in the alpine permafrost region. Our findings emphasize the significance of incorporating comprehensive seasonal observation of CH4 emissions across different vegetation zones in better predicting CH4 emissions from alpine ponds and lakes. Alpine ponds and lakes emit about 20% of annual CH4 emissions at ice thaw, but the ratio varies greatly across vegetation zones Limited substrates and high dissolved oxygen under ice reduce CH4 emissions at ice thaw from saline waterbodies in alpine desert zones The average areal CH4 flux from ponds and lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is only 8% of that reported for high-latitude waterbodies					; Guo, Linmao/JSL-1851-2023; Sun, Shou-Qin/AAC-5884-2020; Song, Chunlin/AGU-3084-2022; Li, Jinlong/KOD-6176-2024; Li, Yudong/GSN-4036-2022	Yang, Li/0000-0003-3439-9446; Guo, Linmao/0000-0002-4892-8735; Sun, Shouqin/0000-0003-0022-5982; Huang, Peng/0009-0009-7837-4217; Wang, Genxu/0000-0002-3403-0983; Li, Jinlong/0000-0003-0509-8118; Song, Chunlin/0000-0003-3627-2350													0886-6236	1944-9224				APR	2024	38	4							e2024GB008106	10.1029/2024GB008106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GB008106													WOS:001196277700001

The objective of this study was to clarify the biogeochemical functioning of open-water peatland pools and their influence on carbon budgets at the ecosystem and global scale. Continuously operated automated equipment and monthly manual measurements were used to describe the CO2 and CH4 dynamics in boreal ombrotrophic peatland pools and porewater (Quebec, Canada) over the growing seasons 2019 and 2020. The peat porewater stable carbon isotope ratios (delta 13C) for both CO2 (median delta 13C-CO2: -3.8 parts per thousand) and CH4 (median delta 13C-CH4: -64.30 parts per thousand) suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the predominant degradation pathway in peat. Open-water pools were supersaturated in CO2 and CH4 and received most of these dissolved carbon greenhouse gases (C-GHG) from peat porewater input. Throughout the growing season, higher CO2 concentrations and fluxes in pools were measured when the water table was low-suggesting a steady release of CO2 from deep peat porewater. Higher CH4 ebullition and diffusion occurred in August when bottom water and peat temperatures were the highest. While this study demonstrates that peatland pools are chimneys of CO2 and CH4 stored in peat, it also shows that the C-GHG concentrations and flux rates in peat pools are comparable to other aquatic systems of the same size. Although peatlands are often considered uniform entities, our study highlights their biogeochemical heterogeneity, which, if considered, substantially influences their net carbon balance with the atmosphere. Peatland pools are supersaturated in CO2 and CH4 and represent net carbon greenhouse gas sources to the atmosphere CO2 and CH4 concentrations and fluxes fluctuated over the seasons and were explained by water table level fluctuations and temperature changes Net peatland carbon budgets must include open water surface emissions to avoid overestimating carbon removal from peatlands					; Taillardat, Pierre/AAA-1128-2021; Linkhorst, Annika/AAR-6013-2020	Taillardat, Pierre/0000-0003-0195-3690; Prijac, Antonin/0000-0002-8326-054X; Garneau, Michelle/0000-0002-1956-9243; Linkhorst, Annika/0000-0002-3609-5107													0886-6236	1944-9224				APR	2024	38	4							e2023GB007909	10.1029/2023GB007909	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GB007909													WOS:001202811000001

We demonstrate the advantages of 3D simulation compared to 1D vertical models. The model captures the seasonal variability in the lake, with seasonal deep mixing and surfacing of the thermocline. In a simulation of current conditions, the thermocline in the south of the lake moves upward from a depth of 75 m until it reaches the lake surface during August and September. We compare the current conditions with an end-of-the-century simulation under a pessimistic emission scenario (RCP 8.5) showing that surface water temperature increases on average by 3 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Because deeper water warms less, the stratification increases in the upper 150 m of the water column. This temperature-induced stratification reduces mixing and prevents the outcropping of the thermocline, eventually shutting down the ventilation of deep water in the south basin. Our results highlight the extreme changes likely faced by Lake Tanganyika if global greenhouse gas emissions are not curbed.					; Deleersnijder, Eric/AAE-7020-2020; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021	Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				FEB	2023	23	1					103	123		10.1007/s10652-022-09908-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-022-09908-8		JAN 2023											WOS:000911947300001

However, this amount of data is complex to analyze since velocity observations span different temporal baselines. Velocities obtained from a small temporal baseline are close to the derivative of the displacement but are more likely to be contaminated by noise. Velocities obtained from a long temporal baseline approximate the mean velocity between two dates but can be affected by temporal decorrelation. Having short and long temporal baselines provides a data redundancy that needs to be properly considered. In this article, we propose a method that aims to extract short-term velocity time series with regular temporal sampling from all available displacement observations. The proposed method relies on a temporal inversion based on an improved temporal closure of the displacement observation network. Two criteria are proposed to determine the optimal temporal sampling to study short-term variations. To take the unequal data uncertainty into account, the temporal inversion is done by an iterative reweighted least square using a well-established weighting function, without preprocessing. The proposed method results in velocity time series with an optimal temporal sampling, improved temporal coverage, reduced uncertainty, and no redundancy. The studied area is the Kyagar glacier, in the North of the Karakoram range that is characterized by strong velocity variations originated from a glacier surge and additional seasonal variability.

Multitemporal mapping of glacier lakes through optical satellite remote-sensing imageries can only provide us comparative analysis of glacier lake changes during long time intervals. In recent years, the rapid development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has made it possible to observe seasonal changes of glacial lakes. This letter proposed a polarization enhancement-based maximum interclass variance (PE-MIV) method to accurately and automatically mapping the seasonal cycles of glacial lakes based on multipolarization SAR data. Taking the Gongcuo and Langcuo glacial lakes in Laigu village, Tibetan Plateau, as examples, based on 113 Sentinel-1 SAR imageries covering 2017 to 2020 with a 12-day revisiting time, the seasonal boundary changes of both lakes were extracted automatically with a relative accuracy of 93.59%. The seasonal variations of glacial lake area are closely related to temperature and precipitation. This letter demonstrated that the satellite SAR (short revisiting time, multipolarization, etc.) is an effective tool to monitor areal changes of glacier lakes, which can be widely applied in detecting glacier lakes, GLOFs, and their response to climate change.					rubing, liang/HZH-5031-2023; Fan, Xuanmei/C-5219-2015; zhang, lele/JWP-3681-2024; zhang, lele/IWM-4398-2023; Xu, Qiang/AAE-3255-2022	zhang, lele/0009-0000-8519-1421; 													1545-598X	1558-0571					2022	19								4502005	10.1109/LGRS.2021.3131717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2021.3131717													WOS:000740006800027

R.			Intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence on an omnivore's gut microbiome	PLOS ONE												Gut microbiomes (GMBs), complex communities of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts, perform countless micro-ecosystem services such as facilitating energy uptake and modulating immune responses. While scientists increasingly recognize the role GMBs play in host health, the role of GMBs in wildlife ecology and conservation has yet to be realized fully. Here, we use brown bears (Ursus arctos) as an ecological model to (1) characterize GMB community composition associated with location, season, and reproductive condition of a large omnivore; (2) investigate how both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence GMB community membership and structure; and (3) quantify differences in GMB communities among different locations, seasons, sex, and reproductive conditions. To achieve these aims, we subsampled brown bear fecal samples collected during United States National Park Service research activities at three National Parks and Preserves (Katmai, Lake Clark, and Gates of the Arctic) and extracted microbial DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and microbial taxonomic classification. We analyzed GMB communities using alpha and beta diversity indices, subsequently using linear mixed models to examine relationships between alpha diversity and extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Katmai brown bears hosted the greatest alpha diversity, whereas Gates brown bears hosted the least alpha diversity. Our results indicate that location and diet drive GMB variation, with bears hosting less phylogenetic diversity as park distance inland increases. Monitoring brown bear GMBs could enable managers to quickly detect and assess the impact of environmental perturbations on brown bear health. By integrating macro and micro-ecological perspectives we aim to inform local and landscape-level management decisions to promote long-term brown bear conservation and management.					; Rogers, Matthew/AAG-3686-2020	McKenney, Erin/0000-0001-9874-1146; Trujillo, Sarah/0000-0002-6867-2837; Lafferty, Diana J.

The Siberian Crane (Grus leucogeranus) has been recognized as critically endangered according to 'Red List' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN); however their stopover habitats are threatened by various causes and thus, are depleting. To identify the range and environmental characteristics of the stopover habitats selected by the Siberian Cranes during their migration in Northeast China, important factors influencing these habitats and habitat suitability distribution were studied by using the maximum entropy model. Subsequently, climate conditions and wetland types were the most important factors, based on which the Siberian cranes selected the stopover habitats. The stopover habitats selected by the Siberian Cranes were primarily located in areas with mean annual total precipitation less than 400 mm, mean annual temperature between 4 degrees C and 7 degrees C, and seasonal brackish and alkaline marshes. Areas within and near the Momoge National Nature Reserve on the West Songnen Plain were vital resting sites for the Siberian Crane. The spatial distribution of habitat suitability evidently varied, and 20% areas of the reserve, which demonstrated a high degree of habitat suitability, were observed outside the reserve boundaries, thus, indicating gaps in conservation of the Siberian Cranes habitats in Northeast China. The results of this study highlight the need for implementing effective measures to conserve the Siberian Cranes habitat to maintain sustainable ecosystems.

Despite the recent subtle local expansion in the geographic distribution of the species during the past decade, studies on the life history of the species are still lacking. We carried out a study on the phenology of emergence and flight season on Lake Bleu, Northeast-Algeria. Using repeated sampling of exuviae and marking of adults during two seasons (2018 and 2019), we estimated the population size, sex ratio, and the temporal pattern of emergence and flight season. The first year (2018) was considerably drier than the second year (2019). We collected a total of 576 and 887 exuviae and 711 and 655 adults in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The sex ratio at emergence was slightly female-biased with 57.1% in the first year and equal to unity (50.5%) in the second year, respectively. The species started its emergence earlier in the dry year (2018). The emergence of the species was quite asynchronous where 50% of the population emerged after 11 days and 16 days in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The difference in population size (based on exuviae) and the temporal pattern of emergence and flight season were likely due to differences in weather between the two years. The current study provides useful information on the life history and plasticity of U. edwardsii, which could be used for the management of this locally Critically Endangered dragonfly.					; psy, eco/GXV-3091-2022; Zebsa, Rabah/ABD-4489-2021; Moussa, Houhamdi/J-2708-2018; Khelifa, Rassim/U-2405-2019	Mahdjoub, Hayat/0000-0002-8972-9628; Zebsa, Rabah/0000-0001-8214-9500; Moussa, Houhamdi/0000-0002-4644-8906; Bensakhri, Zinette/0000-0001-5024-1329; Youcefi, Abdeldjalil/0000-0003-2003-6767; Zouaimia, Abdelheq/0000-0002-5652-3148; 													2500-008X						2022	7	1					1	9		10.24189/ncr.2022.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.24189/ncr.2022.003													WOS:000742656000001

In this study, lake water isotopic compositions were measured for more than three years in Lake Taihu, a large and shallow lake in southern China, to investigate the isotopic spatial and seasonal variations. The results indicated that (1) the whole-lake mean H-2 and O-18 values of the lake water varied seasonally from -48.4 +/- 5.8 to -25.1 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand and from -6.5 +/- 0.9 to -3.5 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand, respectively, (2) the spatial pattern of the lake water isotopic compositions was controlled by the direction of water flow and not by local evaporation rate, and (3) using a one-site isotopic measurement to represent the whole-lake mean may result in unreasonable estimates of the isotopic composition of lake evaporation and the lake water residence time in poorly mixed lakes. The original data, documented here as an online supplement, provides a good reference for testing sensitivity of lake water budget to various isotopic sampling strategies. We propose that detailed spatial measurement of lake water isotopic compositions provides a good proxy for water movement and pollutant and alga transports, especially over big lakes.

Climate change and bird impact as drivers of High Arctic pond deterioration	POLAR BIOLOGY												The environmental history since the end of the Little Ice Age of the bird-influenced pond Fugledammen (Hornsund, Svalbard, 77A degrees N) was inferred from a 1-m sediment core using paleolimnological methods. The aim was to track long-term environmental changes and to evaluate the limnological consequences of catchment development in this extremely sensitive landscape. A special focus is given to the impacts of climate change and the observed increase in bird populations in the catchment. The late nineteenth century was characterized by littoral scraping/filtering Cladocera together with vegetation-associated chironomids. The invertebrate community became less diverse towards the twentieth century. Planktonic filter-feeder cladocerans replaced the littoral taxa and collector-gatherers became the most abundant chironomid feeding group. In the more recent sediment layers, invertebrate diversity decreased further but the number of individuals (biomass) increased. Daphnia showed a progressive increase that is typical for similar Arctic ponds in Svalbard, where nutrient loading has increased due to growing bird populations in the catchment. The decreases in vegetation-associated invertebrates, biodiversity, and functional diversity suggest that turbidity has increased and oxygen availability and light penetration decreased in the lake. The paleoecological record is in agreement with the sediment physical and geochemical evidence, indicating that in-lake productivity has strongly increased towards the present. These changes are concurrent with the recent climate warming in Svalbard suggesting that, in addition to longer ice-free season and increased water temperature, the increased air temperatures have various indirect catchment-mediated influences on the aquatic community through changes in bird-population size.

The model simulates two elemental cycles (N and P), two phytoplankton groups (cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria), and heterotrophic bacteria. First, we examine the capacity to reproduce the observed plankton patterns, while accommodating the uncertainty related to the external forcing factors of our model (hydraulic and nutrient loading, zooplanlcton grazing). Sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify the most influential parameters and therefore to shed light on the knowledge needed to solidify the model parameter specification. We subsequently utilize the calibrated model to assess the phytoplankton response to potential restoration actions; namely, the interplay between external nutrient loading reductions and variant flushing rates. The model successfully simulates a number of relevant water quality variables in the system, including total chlorophyll a, nitrate, ammonia, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. According to our sensitivity analysis, the credibility of the model as a management tool is primarily dependent upon the characterization of the phytoplankton growth strategies and associated settling rates. External P and N loadings are identified as the predominant driver of the system dynamics and their control should remain the main priority of local management efforts. Finally, we pinpoint future research directions that could advance our understanding of the ecosystem functioning, including an improved quantitative description of the seasonal variability of the hydraulic regime in the studied lagoon.

A higher microbial a-diversity in the sediment was revealed (P < 0.01), and the most common bacterial phyla in water column were Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, while Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi and Nitrospirae were dominant in sediment. Functions related to phototrophy and nitrogen metabolism primarily occurred in the water column and sediment, respectively. The microbial communities in water column from different seasons were divided into three groups, while no such dispersion in sediment based on PCoA and ANOSIM. According to Pearson correlation analysis, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, water depth, total nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrite were key factors in determining microbial community structure in water column, while TN in sediment, conductivity, and organic matter were key factors in sediment. However, the stochastic processes (| beta NTI| < 2) dominated community assembly in both the water column and sediment of Lake Wuchang. These data will provide a foundation for microbial development and utilization in lake water column and sediment under the circumstances of increasing tendency of lake ecological fishery in China.

In the present study, dissolved MCs in water, algal cell-bound MCs and muscle tissue MCs of nine fish species were investigated monthly in two of the largest shallow lakes in China: Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. The fish species were grouped as carnivorous, planktivorous, and omnivorous fish. Seasonal variations in dissolved and algal cell-bound MCs in water and MCs contents of fish hepatopancreas and muscle were investigated in the two lakes from 2009 to 2010. Dissolved MCs in water ranged from 0.35 to 2.56 mu g l(-1) in Lake Taihu and 0.16 to 2.45 mu g l(-1) in Lake Chaohu, and showed seasonally a unimodal distribution. Algal cell-bound MCs also showed a similar seasonal variation in both lakes, but dissolved MCs in water peaked about one month later than algal cell-bound MCs. The MCs content in the Fish muscle was higher MCs from October to December than in the other months. For most of the fish species, it exceeded the tolerable daily intake value established by the WHO. The averaged MCs content in the muscle of carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fish was 48.2, 28.7 and 37.8 mu g kg(-1) in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 27.8, 18.6 and 20.4 mu g kg(-1) in Lake Chaohu. It was significantly higher in carnivorous fish than in planktivorous and omnivorous fish, indicating that carnivorous fish has a higher exposure risk to the local people when consuming the harvested fish. The average ratio of hepatopancreas to muscle MCs contents was 13.0, 25.2, 13.8 for carnivorous, planktivorous, omnivorous fishes in Lake Taihu, respectively, and 18.0, 24.9, 14.8 in Lake Chaohu. These ratio for planktivorous fish almost doubled that for carnivorous and omnivorous fish. High correlation of MC content in carnivorous, omnivorous and planktivorous fish indicates that MCs can be delivered along trophic levels in the food chains.

Variation in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) abundance in rivers across Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the variation in relative abundance of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) subjected to various man-induced stresses and physical characteristics at a landscape scale across Ontario; and (ii) ascertain the factors that explain the variability observed among rivers using a multivariate approach. A standardized index netting program targeting juvenile and adult Lake Sturgeon was conducted over two field seasons at 22 river sites across Ontario. Each river had unique or different human-induced stresses and physical characteristics. Relative abundance of Lake Sturgeon varied in river across the Ontario landscape. A principal component analysis was conducted using site physical characteristics with the associated anthropogenic stressors. The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for juvenile and adult Lake Sturgeon were then regressed with the scores of principal components having eigenvalues >1. The variation observed was best explained by the negative relationship observed between CPUE and the presence of hydroelectric generating stations. Historical commercial fisheries also had an effect on Lake Sturgeon abundance whereas subsistence fisheries seemed to focus on rivers that were not regulated and where Lake Sturgeon numbers were greater. Research and recovery efforts should focus on minimizing the impact of hydroelectric generation on Lake Sturgeon while achieving socioeconomic goals.

J	Larson, ER; Olden, JD; Usio, N				Larson, Eric R.; Olden, Julian D.; Usio, Nisikawa			Decoupled conservatism of Grinnellian and Eltonian niches in an invasive arthropod	ECOSPHERE												Whether a species niche is conserved or shifts across space and time is a question of heightened interest in ecology and evolution. Considerable scientific inquiry into this topic has used invasive species to evaluate conservatism of the Grinnellian climatic niche while generally neglecting the Eltonian functional niche. By contrast, we report here on the first simultaneous reciprocal comparison of both the Grinnellian and Eltonian niches for the globally invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus between its native (Pacific Northwest of North America) and non-native ranges (Japan). Using multivariate statistics and the Maxent machine-learning algorithm, we found strong evidence for a climatic niche shift between geographic regions for P. leniusculus. Pacifastacus leniusculus shifted from warmer temperatures with strong precipitation seasonality in western North America to cooler temperatures with less precipitation seasonality in Japan. However, analysis of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen revealed conservatism of the functional niche of P. leniusculus between multiple lakes in the native and non-native ranges. We found that trophic position and niche width of P. leniusculus were equivalent between regions, and that niche attributes including reliance on autochthonous or allochthonous energy sources and ontogenetic shifts were comparable regardless of origin. Our finding of functional niche conservatism contrasts with the results of some recent studies evaluating the Grinnellian niche for invasive species, as well as our own climatic niche comparison, and raises the question of whether Grinnellian or Eltonian niches are more prone to shifts or conservatism. We hypothesize that the Grinnellian niche may be more labile than the Eltonian niche in general, but argue that resolving this question will require more reciprocal comparisons of Eltonian niches to keep pace with the recent increase in Grinnellian niche studies.

These lakes, which are heavily utilized for aquaculture and ecotourism, usually experience fish kills that coincide with the northeast monsoon (NEM). This study explores limnophysical processes, particularly mixing regimes, in the lakes in relation to prevailing monsoons. We monitored monthly vertical and seasonal profiles of water temperature, salinity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen from October 2016 to December 2018. Three types of mixing regimes were observed among the lakes, which have similar surface areas but different depths: polymixis in the shallowest; warm monomixis in lakes with intermediate depth; and meromixis in the deepest. A boundary between monomixis and meromixis was identified between 36 and 62 m depth. Monthly monitoring showed seasonal mixing occurred exclusively during the NEM (Nov-Apr). We also incorporated meteorological data into the model and performed multiple regression analysis for each lake to determine the best predictor: lake stability, as indicated by the Schmidt stability (S-T). A between-lake comparison showed lake stability was strongly correlated with both air temperature and wind speed, suggesting these 2 meteorological variables are involved in establishing thermal stratification in the lakes during the southwest monsoon. This study provides insights for adaptive lake management and projections of climate impacts on these understudied tropical lake ecosystems in Southeast Asia.					; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022	Padilla, Karol Sophia Agape/0000-0002-3357-7266; MENDOZA-PASCUAL, MILETTE/0000-0003-2637-2091; Papa, Rey Donne/0000-0003-0146-2525													2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2023	13	1					47	61		10.1080/20442041.2023.2167484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2023.2167484		JAN 2023											WOS:000972324400001
J	Matthews, MW				Matthews, Mark William			Near-term forecasting of cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms in lakes using simple univariate methods with satellite remote sensing data	INLAND WATERS												Near-term forecasting of cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms (HABs) in lakes is essential to reduce risks to human and animal health and water treatment. Cyanobacteria forecasting models are typically complex, requiring input of biophysical and chemical measurements or DNA sequencing in situ. Satellite imagery presents a unique opportunity to estimate cyanobacteria concentration directly at low cost and over wide spatial and long timescales. This study explores the hypothesis that simple univariate forecasting methods can reliably forecast cyanobacterial blooms in the near-term (1 week ahead) detected using satellite remote sensing. A simple univariate model based on logical decomposition with a moving average and seasonal component was developed to forecast chlorophyll a concentrations from cyanobacteria and algal blooms in lakes using spatially aggregated satellite remotely sensed data. A small test set of 15 spatially distributed waterbodies was used to assess forecast performance on 1-week, 2-week, and 4-week forecast horizons using a year-long hold-out time series. For a 1-week time horizon, cyanobacterial blooms posing a high health risk could be forecast with 80% accuracy. The 2-week and 4-week forecast accuracy dropped to 71% and 69%, respectively. Forecast performance was only weakly influenced by lake size, suggesting that the spatial-aggregation approach may be valid even for large lakes. Additionally, longer time series reduced the observed forecast error, presumably because of better seasonal characterization. This study is the first to demonstrate that simple univariate models with remotely sensed time series can forecast cyanobacteria and HABs with almost the same reliability as complex models.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				JAN 2	2023	13	1					62	73		10.1080/20442041.2022.2145839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2022.2145839		JAN 2023											WOS:000943409800001

Therefore, we comprehensively studied the abundance, sources, distribution, and environmental behavior of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in Fengshuba Reservoir (FSBR) (a large drinking reservoir, China). A graded leaching technique (introduced in 2003), the European Standard, Measurement and Testing (SMT) protocol, and spectrometry combined with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) were used to assess nitrogen, phosphorus forms, and spectra data in the sediment and soil phases, respectively. The study demonstrates that seasonal hydrological variation had no significant effect on the nutrient abundance and nutrient structure composition of the FSBR, while different environmental media (e.g., sediment and soil phase) exhibited considerable differences in nutrient abundance, composition, and environmental behavior. The abundance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as well as molecular weight, aromatization degree, and humification degree of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were all lower in sediments than in soils, whereas the authigenic component was greater than in soils. Microbial-derived humus (C1), terrestrial-derived humus (C2), and protein-like tryptophan (C3) were identified as the three primary fluorescence components. Principal component analysis indicated that three components were closely associated with phosphorus in the sediment phase, whereas nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil phase were mainly related to C1 and C2. In summary, soil media (drawdown area) must be carefully considered in the management and control of water environment nutrients in reservoirs.

During the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition, climatic and environmental conditions turned into crises, caused by a sudden and serious global warming, accompanied by the largest known extinction event of all time. Several studies have been conducted to discover the causes of this notable climate change. Nevertheless, the evolution of water circulation processes during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition is still unclear. Several lithologic indicators present in paleoclimate records have been described over the last few decades. Based on these data, we defined climate zones and calculated their area values using Thiessen polygons and Geographic Information System technology to visualize climate evolution during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition. Results of a few of the climate simulations showed changes in precipitation and the amplitudes of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) seasonal migration. The results showed several changes in water circulation during the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic. (1) The climate zones reconstructed by sedimentary and paleontological records showed a remarkable arid expansion. The distribution area of evaporites began to expand in the Middle to Late Permian and reached a peak in the Early Triassic, returned to Middle-Late Permian levels in the Middle Triassic, and thereafter continued to narrow during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. (2) Global precipitation was higher during the Late Carboniferous and Early Jurassic and lower in the Middle to Late Permian and Early Triassic. Such a "V" shape represents considerable swing. (3) The assembly of Pangea might have led to "giant land surface winds" in Pangaea and "trans-equatorial winds" in the Tethys region, resulting in a global "megamonsoon". (4) Seasonal movements of the ITCZ were located at lower latitudes from the Silurian to Carboniferous and from the Jurassic to the present, while reaching higher latitudes with large seasonal oscillations during the Permian-Triassic. Depending on the timing of events, these major changes in water circulation coincided with the assembly of Pangaea, the Variscan or Hercynian orogeny, the end of the late Paleozoic ice age, major carbon emissions, and global warming. These factors are closely related to the changes in atmospheric and water circulation during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition. The assembly of Pangea redistributed water storage and altered atmospheric circulation and the "megamonsoon", while the elevation reduction of mountains traversing middle Pangea weakened the resistance of north and south winds. These factors promoted the evolution of a "megamonsoon" with strong seasonal swings of the ITCZ, which led to the expansion of arid zones and reduced precipitation during the Middle and Late Permian. Meanwhile, large carbon emissions and dramatic global warming altered the energy transition within global systems, which influenced atmospheric circulation. In addition, transformations of global plant clades affected the carbon budget and altered water circulation. In summary, strong fluctuations in water circulation were present during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition, especially as observed through climate zones, precipitation and runoff, the "monsoon", and ITCZ. These crucial processes reflect the interaction between the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. However, we have limited knowledge of the complete process of water circulation because geological records and climate simulations are extremely imprecise for the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition. Future research could focus on other water circulation processes, such as the evolution of underground water, reserves, and fluxes of lakes, rather than only precipitation and "monsoons". Moreover, the upgrade and extension of big data platforms and a larger number of climate simulations should be considered in future studies.

Knowledge gaps and biases in the Pantanal indicate future directions for ornithological research in large wetlands	IBIS												While taxonomic and biogeographical biases are often acknowledged, those for certain biological responses and species traits are routinely overlooked, generating major gaps in knowledge and conservation of biodiversity. Biases in research on birds - an over-sampled, diverse vertebrate class - may be readily detectable, and wetlands are important species-rich ecosystems in which to identify biases and research gaps for birds. The Pantanal, one of the world's largest wetlands, is globally relevant for bird conservation. In this wetland, we determined spatial, temporal, taxonomic and biological response-related biases in ornithological studies to guide future research in this ecosystem and, ultimately, in major global wetlands. Avian research was geographically biased, with 61 studies conducted in the Brazilian Pantanal and only one in Bolivia. Most studies were concentrated near urban centres, with poorly explored areas in the central Pantanal. Research was also over-represented during the dry season when field conditions are more favourable, but such temporal bias may hamper migration studies. Considering their richness, some families were studied disproportionately more (e.g. Jacanidae) or less (e.g. Tyrannidae). Some species (e.g. Wood Stork Mycteria americana and Yellow-billed Cardinal Paroaria capitata) were included in > 25% of studies, whereas a relatively low number of threatened bird species were studied. Behaviour was the most studied response, followed by abundance and reproduction, which were considered for > 65% of species studied. We conclude that further research needs to be focused on unexplored areas and periods, less detectable species, and ecological processes (e.g. interspecific interactions). Additionally, our results can provide useful information to better address future work and bird conservation actions in other large wetlands. For example, major gaps detected here constitute a primary roadmap to guide research in under-sampled regions, such as the Canadian peatlands and Tonle Sap Lake. Specifically, more studies on waterbirds in highly diverse wetlands from low-income countries (e.g. Okavango and Sundarban Delta) may help to disentangle the essential functional role provided for these species and to prioritize conservation actions in regions with limited research capacity.					; Piacentini, Vitor/K-1199-2012; TEIXIDO, ALBERTO L/A-9551-2015	Fernandez, Gilberto/0000-0002-4076-1854; Ferreira, Tiago Valadares/0000-0001-9669-0509; Piacentini, Vitor/0000-0003-1571-2222; Fioreze Zucchetto, Mayara/0000-0001-7437-0264; TEIXIDO, ALBERTO L/0000-0001-8009-1237; Amaral Goncalves, Stela Rosa/0000-0002-8888-2735													0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	2021	163	3					784	797		10.1111/ibi.12931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12931		FEB 2021											WOS:000617314200001

Lee; Lucero, Delores M.; Bergamaschi, Brian			Identifying sources of dissolved organic carbon in agriculturally dominated rivers using radiocarbon age dating: Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin, California	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We used radiocarbon measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to resolve sources of riverine carbon within agriculturally dominated landscapes in California. During 2003 and 2004, average Delta(14)C for DOC was -254aEuro degrees in agricultural drains in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, -218aEuro degrees in the San Joaquin River, -175aEuro degrees in the California State Water Project and -152aEuro degrees in the Sacramento River. The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbanization. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured (14)C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average Delta(14)C of 91 and 76aEuro degrees for the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA, -204aEuro degrees, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non-HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaquin River with seasonally computed Delta(14)C values of between -275 and -687aEuro degrees; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i.e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabilization of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.

The use of artificial floating nest platforms as conservation measure for the common tern Sterna hirundo: a case study in the RAMSAR site Druzno Lake in Northern Poland	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Artificial nesting sites with floating platforms may effectively support local breeding populations of waterbirds (enhancing productivity and survival) when natural sites are unavailable. In this study, we installed three artificial floating nest platforms (one in 2017, two in 2020) and we evaluated their use as a conservation measure for the common tern Sterna hirundo breeding at a RAMSAR site in Northern Poland with limited natural nesting habitat. We analyzed local population dynamics based on direct census in the study area from 2013 to 2021 and using data from literature dating back to 1925, with emphasis on the effects of three artificial nest platforms. We found that the local common tern population exhibited steep decline during the period 1999-2021 (-92%). Birds accepted artificial nesting platforms in the first year of their installation. The number of pairs breeding in artificial nests in 2017-2021 made up 53-100% of the breeding population in the study area. The nest density, clutch size and mean breeding output were similar in all platforms during all seasons. In 2020, the water level in the lake rapidly increased (ca 50 cm in 24 h) and completely destroyed common tern nests in the natural islets, while the floating platforms were the only places in the nature reserve where common terns were able to nest and breed successfully. We conclude that artificial breeding platforms may be a good conservation measure for common terns in natural areas with limited access to breeding habitat (but with optimal foraging areas). Based on our experiences from the present case study and on experience of other authors we propose recommendations for constructing, placing, and maintenance of nest platforms for common terns.

Previous approaches exhibit limited applicability in southeastern China, given its complex and heterogeneous landscapes as well as the difficulty to obtain cloud-free images. To overcome these problems, we proposed an approach using index composition and HIS (hue, intensity and saturation) transformation. First, a colour image was generated using three indices: the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Then, HIS transformation was employed to extract water bodies and remove hill shadows. Another colour image, composed by Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) 4, NDVI, TM1 and HIS transformation, was further applied to separate water bodies from residual shadows. This approach was tested and verified with Landsat TM images in the Tiaoxi watershed, southeastern China. The results indicated the high accuracy and promising applicability of this new approach for fragmented landscapes, given its insensitivity to seasonal and subjective factors.

A multi-source satellite data approach for modelling Lake Turkana water level: calibration and validation using satellite altimetry data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lake Turkana is one of the largest desert lakes in the world and is characterized by high degrees of inter- and intra-annual fluctuations. The hydrology and water balance of this lake have not been well understood due to its remote location and unavailability of reliable ground truth datasets. Managing surface water resources is a great challenge in areas where in-situ data are either limited or unavailable. In this study, multi-source satellite-driven data such as satellite-based rainfall estimates, modelled runoff, evapotranspiration, and a digital elevation dataset were used to model Lake Turkana water levels from 1998 to 2009. Due to the unavailability of reliable lake level data, an approach is presented to calibrate and validate the water balance model of Lake Turkana using a composite lake level product of TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and ENVISAT satellite altimetry data. Model validation results showed that the satellite-driven water balance model can satisfactorily capture the patterns and seasonal variations of the Lake Turkana water level fluctuations with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.90 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE) of 0.80 during the validation period (2004-2009). Model error estimates were within 10% of the natural variability of the lake. Our analysis indicated that fluctuations in Lake Turkana water levels are mainly driven by lake inflows and over-the-lake evaporation. Over-the-lake rainfall contributes only up to 30% of lake evaporative demand. During the modelling time period, Lake Turkana showed seasonal variations of 1-2 m. The lake level fluctuated in the range up to 4 m between the years 1998-2009. This study demonstrated the usefulness of satellite altimetry data to calibrate and validate the satellite-driven hydrological model for Lake Turkana without using any in-situ data. Furthermore, for Lake Turkana, we identified and outlined opportunities and challenges of using a calibrated satellite-driven water balance model for (i) quantitative assessment of the impact of basin developmental activities on lake levels and for (ii) forecasting lake level changes and their impact on fisheries. From this study, we suggest that globally available satellite altimetry data provide a unique opportunity for calibration and validation of hydrologic models in ungauged basins.

Leigh			An isotopic (Δ14C, δ13C, and δ15N) investigation of the composition of particulate organic matter and zooplankton food sources in Lake Superior and across a size-gradient of aquatic systems	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Food webs in aquatic systems can be supported both by carbon from recent local primary productivity and by carbon subsidies, such as material from terrestrial ecosystems, or past in situ primary productivity. The importance of these subsidies to respiration and biomass production remains a topic of debate. While some studies have reported that terrigenous organic carbon supports disproportionately high zooplankton production, others have suggested that phytoplankton preferentially support zooplankton production in aquatic ecosystems. Here we apply natural abundance radiocarbon (Delta C-14) and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) analyses to show that zooplankton in Lake Superior selectively incorporate recently fixed, locally produced (autochthonous) organic carbon even though other carbon sources are readily available. Estimates from Bayesian isotopic modeling based on Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values show that the average lake-wide median contributions of recent in-lake primary production and terrestrial, sedimentary, and bacterial organic carbon to the bulk POM in Lake Superior were 58%, 5%, 33%, and 3%, respectively. However, isotopic modeling estimates also show that recent in situ production contributed a disproportionately large amount (median, 91%) of the carbon in mesozooplankton biomass in Lake Superior. Although terrigenous organic carbon and old organic carbon from resuspended sediments were significant portions (median, 38%) of the available basal food resources, these contributed only a small amount to mesozooplankton biomass. Comparison of zooplankton food sources based on their radiocarbon composition showed that terrigenous organic carbon was relatively more important in rivers and small lakes, and the proportion of terrestrially derived material used by zooplankton correlated with the hydrologic residence time and the ratio of basin area to water surface area.

J	Katkaew, N; Chamchoi, N				Katkaew, Nattarika; Chamchoi, Nutchanat			Threshold amounts of nutrients and the relationship with chlorophyll a during eutrophication phenomenon in small-scale artificial reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS												This study aimed at determining the relationship of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and the nutrients in two reservoirs of different sizes, namely Bueng Si Than and Bueng Thung Sang, which are located in Khon Kaen Province in Thailand. The evaluation of the trophic state index and the estimated threshold amounts of nutrients was consequently considered. Water samples were collected during both the dry and rainy seasons with twenty-seven sampling points in each reservoir. Parameters indicating water quality and nutrients were based on the APHA method. The results showed a significant difference in the average physicochemical properties and nutritional parameters of the water in a smaller proportion, with Bueng Si Than having more than Bueng Thung Sang (p < 0.05). Nutrient factors (TP, TKN) showed the impact on the occurrence of eutrophication during both the dry season and the rainy season. Average ratios of nutrients and Chl a together with the trophic state index revealed the occurrence of hypertrophic conditions in both reservoirs. The high value of Chl a:TP signaled that the algal growth in these reservoirs could be controlled by TP. The Pearson correlation analysis indicated a strong positive relationship of Chl a and TP in Bueng Si Than. Moreover, the obtained results from the simulation were achieved using MATLAB R2022a, and were performed with the fourth order polynomial equation, which indicated the boundary values of 28.25-29.42 mu g/L and 4.15-4.19 mg/L for the threshold amounts of TP and TKN prior to Eutrophic occurrence, ascertain further eutrophication management in small-scale artificial reservoirs.																			2665-9727					JUN	2024	22								100378	10.1016/j.indic.2024.100378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2024.100378		MAR 2024											WOS:001222226900001

CH4 emission from paddy fields is greatly influenced by phosphorus (P) management, especially the long-term non-P application on CH4 emission is largely unexplored. In the present study, long-term non-P application (NK) and P application (NPK) treatments of two paddy fields in Suzhou (from 1980) and Yixing (from 2009), Tai Lake region was done. The effect of P application on CH4 emissions and related microorganisms (i.e., methanogens and methanotrophs) from 2019 to 2020 was analyzed. Results revealed that long-term NK treatment didn't alter the seasonal trend of CH4 flux, but significantly promoted CH4 emissions at the tillering stage. The non-P application for >12 years caused the cumulative CH4 emissions of NK treatment in the whole rice season significantly increased by 41.9-221 % in two fields compared to NPK treatment in 2019 and 2020. NK treatment increased the abundance and diversity of methanogens, while reducing the abundance and diversity of methanotrophs. Community composition of soil pmoA gene differed in two experiment sites. Correlation analysis revealed that the CH4 emission was significant and positively related to soil mcrA gene and C/P while negatively related to soil pmoA gene and P. Structure equation model analysis show the low soil available P content was the dominant driving factor for the high CH4 emission under long-term non-P application through its direct impact on soil mcrA and pmoA genes. The increased soil organic acid content was another driver which was positively related to soil mcrA gene and negatively to soil pmoA gene. Our findings demonstrate the impor- tant role of soil P in regulating CH4 emissions from paddy fields in the Tai Lake region, China, and suitable P applica- tion is necessary for ensuring the yield while reducing CH4 emission.

In this study, the differential responses of plant community primary productivity to N and phosphorus (P) nutrient application were investigated in the natural (NG) and "Grain for Green" restored (RG) alpine grasslands by a continuous 3-year experiment in the Qinghai Lake Basin. N addition only significantly promoted plant aboveground biomass (AGB) by 42% and had no significant effect on belowground biomass (BGB) and total biomass (TB) in NG. In comparison with NG, N addition elevated AGB and BGB concurrently in RG by 138% and 24%, respectively, which further significantly increased TB by 41% in RG. Meanwhile, N addition significantly decreased BGB and the AGB ratio (R/S) both in NG and RG. Compared with N addition, P addition did not perform an evident effect on plant biomass parameters. Additionally, AGB was merely negatively influenced by growing season temperatures (GST) under the N addition treatment in NG. AGB was negatively associated with GST but positively related to growing season precipitation (GSP) in RG. By contrast, changes in the R/S ratio in RG were positively correlated with GST and negatively related to GSP. In sum, the results revealed that plant community biomass exhibited convergent (AGB and R/S) and divergent (BGB and TB) responses to N addition between NG and RG. In addition, the outcomes suggested that climate warming would enhance plant biomass allocation to belowground under ongoing N deposition, and indicated the significance of precipitation for plant growth and AGB accumulation in this restored alpine grassland ecosystem.

Eco-evolutionary interactions between predators and prey: can predator-induced changes to prey communities feed back to shape predator foraging traits?	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Question: It is well established that predators can influence the structure and dynamics of prey communities and that changes in prey communities can drive predator evolution. Here we ask whether changes in prey communities, brought on by the effects of predators, can feed back to mould the evolution of predator foraging traits. Study system: We sampled lakes in Connecticut (USA) containing either anadromous or landlocked (freshwater resident) alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in 2004 and 2005. Methods: We examined alewife populations for differences in (1) seasonal effects on zooplankton communities, (2) feeding morphology, (3) prey size, and (4) prey selectivity. Results: Landlocked alewives, which are year-round residents of lakes, permanently structure lake zooplankton communities, thereby creating a strong feedback on the evolution of their foraging traits. Anadromous alewives, which are seasonal residents of lakes, intermittently structure lake zooplankton communities, preventing a strong feedback on the evolution of their foraging traits. This difference in the strength of the eco-evolutionary feedback between predator and prey appears to have led to the divergence of foraging morphology and prey selectivity between alewife life-history forms. Conclusions: Predator-induced changes to prey communities can feed back to drive the evolution of predator foraging traits under conditions where eco-evolutionary feedbacks are strong. Moreover, variation in the strength of eco-evolutionary feedbacks appears to shape patterns of ecological and evolutionary diversity in this predator-prey system.

Mortality of Endangered Juvenile Lost River Suckers Associated with Cyanobacteria Blooms in Mesocosms in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Unsustainably high mortality within the first 2 years of life prevents endangered Lost River Suckers Deltistes luxatus in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, from recruiting to spawning populations. Massive blooms of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and their subsequent death and decay in the lake (bloom-crashes) are associated with high pH, low percent oxygen saturation, high total ammonia concentrations, and spikes in the cyanotoxin microcystin. Poor water quality within the lake is considered the most likely cause of juvenile sucker mortality, but mechanisms causing the high mortality are not known. We introduced PIT-tagged age-1 Lost River suckers into three continuously monitored mesocosms in Upper Klamath Lake to determine the timing of juvenile sucker mortality relative to pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Mortality was inferred from a lack of movement detected on remote PIT tag detection equipment within each mesocosm. Mortality was compared among mesocosms and an indoor tank-held control group. We fitted time-varying Cox hazard models to test hypotheses about short-term and chronic effects of single and co-occurring water quality parameters on the daily hazard rate. Presumed healthy or moribund fish that were collected pre-season, mid-season, or at the end of the study were examined macroscopically and histologically to generate inferences about the causes of mortality. Models did not indicate a plausible association between water quality variables and mortality. Hypoxia preceded periods of higher mortality at two of three sites but did not co-occur with mortality. Hatchery-reared Lost River Suckers confined to mesocosms may not represent the behavior of wild fish, and it is unclear whether the same factors affect the mortality of wild age-0 suckers.

Lessons from four decades of monitoring vegetation and fire: maintaining diversity and resilience in Florida's uplands	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Worldwide, humans are altering the fire regimes (fire-return intervals, severity, seasonality) of fire-prone ecosystems, fragmenting natural landscapes, and altering climates. Efforts to restore fire regimes in natural areas are usually guided by fire management plans (FMP) that rely on prescribed burning. Despite the common use of FMPs, limited efforts have gone to assessing vegetative and faunal responses. While some insights into responses to fire from short-term studies are available, there is less knowledge about FMP outcomes applied over multiple decades. Peninsular Florida hosts many fire-prone communities including globally threatened Florida scrub. We repeatedly sampled species composition and abundance during a 38-yr period (1977-2015) at 11 upland stands including wet prairies, flatwoods, and Florida scrub (i.e., oak scrub, rosemary scrub, hickory scrub). A total of 22 fires impacted the stands with individual stands experiencing as few as 2 and up to 11 fires. There was no invasion of non-native plants following fires and stands showed remarkable ecological resilience with limited change in species composition and modest abundance shifts due to differential recovery rates. Importantly, ecological resilience was not eroded with repeated fire. Species richness, evenness, and diversity were significantly higher at the end vs. beginning of our study, suggesting that current fire regimes are within the range of those with which species evolved. While resprouting shrubs and trees persevered under a range of fire-return intervals, an obligate-seeding shrub was adversely impacted by fires more frequent than FMP-recommended intervals. Several lessons are apparent from our findings. Best practice should: use the full range of fire-return variation at evolutionarily appropriate intervals; utilize natural fire seasons to the extent possible; compare outcomes and modify prescriptions as necessary to meet FMP goals; give special consideration to burn units with embedded associations of widely differing fire regimes than principal associations in order to maintain diversity of both associations; and account for climate change in FMPs since fire behavior, frequency, and community responses to fire will likely change in the coming decades. Outcomes of FMPs must be carefully evaluated to ensure prescriptions are evolutionarily appropriate and to ameliorate the impacts of altered climates.																			0012-9615	1557-7015				MAY	2021	91	2								10.1002/ecm.1444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1444		FEB 2021											WOS:000614023600001
J	Nasab, HV; Hashemi, M				Nasab, Hamed Vahdati; Hashemi, Milad			Playas and Middle Paleolithic settlement of the Iranian Central Desert: The discovery of the Chah-e Jam Middle Paleolithic site	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Middle Palaeolithic in the Desert II Conference	DEC, 2014	Univ Bordeaux, UMR5199 PACEA, Bordeaux, FRANCE	CNRS, LabScArEx, Beta Analyt	Univ Bordeaux, UMR5199 PACEA			Geomorphological studies indicate that the current Iranian Central Desert has previously consisted of several large lakes, the remains of which are still visible in the form of numerous playas across the desert. The Northern edge of the Iranian Central Desert has been subject to several seasons of systematic Paleolithic surveys from 2009. As a result of these surveys, several Paleolithic settlements have been recorded, the most significant of which include the Middle Paleolithic sites of Mirak, Soofi-Abad and Chah-e Jam. In order to test whether any Middle Paleolithic sites existed around the boundary of such playas, one of them (Chah-e Jam Desert), which is located at the southern outskirts of the modern city of Damghan (300 km east of Tehran), was selected for intensive walking survey in July-August 2014. During the course of the survey, a large exposure of lithic artefacts, 8.5 km in length, was discovered. Techno-typological analysis of the lithic assemblages indicates an abundance of Levallois technology and numerous retouched tool types (e.g., Levallois points, and all types of convergent scrapers), leading the site to be attributed to the Middle Paleolithic. The presence of some typological elements of later periods indicates the site has been inhabited during Upper/Epipaleolithic periods as well. This site, along with other Middle Paleolithic settlements in this landscape, indicate that climatic conditions during the Late Pleistocene were significantly different to present, and the presence of numerous lakes and associated vegetation permitted hominin populations to occupy currently arid areas.

J	Bueno, RD; Bleninger, T; Lorke, A				Bueno, Rafael de Carvalho; Bleninger, Tobias; Lorke, Andreas			Internal wave analyzer for thermally stratified lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Interwave Analyzer is an open source software that provides detailed characterization of the dynamics of internal waves in lakes and reservoirs. It is based on well-established theories and empirical knowledge on internal waves and lake mixing and facilitates a general physical classification of lakes and reservoirs. As input data, the program requires time series of water temperature from various depths and meteorological data, which can be obtained from measurements or numerical models. Interwave Analyzer performs an in-depth analysis of periodic motion by spectral analysis to identify predominant internal wave periods. To facilitate the identification of wave modes, the software is coupled with a multi-layer model. Interwave Analyzer is a powerful, easily accessible, and universal tool, which can be used for obtaining detailed understanding lake hydrodynamics not only in physical sciences, but also in the context of water quality, ecological interactions and biogeochemical fluxes in aquatic ecosystems.					de Carvalho Bueno, Rafael/IAP-6356-2023; Bleninger, Tobias/H-3269-2012; Lorke, Andreas/B-9195-2008	Lorke, Andreas/0000-0001-5533-1817; Bueno, Rafael/0000-0003-4205-2119													1364-8152	1873-6726				FEB	2021	136								104950	10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104950													WOS:000616063500003

This study demonstrates a climate information service for Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is the largest artificial lake in Asia, facing mounting challenges for flood control, water storage, and water diversion. Unlike traditional water resource management on the basis of short-term weather forecast and runoff monitoring, subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) and annual climate predictions as well as long-term climate change projections were well used to support the decision makers in Danjiangkou Reservoir. The National Climate Center (NCC) has projected the changes of future climate and extreme events by dynamically downscaling the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) projections to 25-km resolution for the long-term planning of water resource management in Danjiangkou Reservoir. Real-time climate predictions based on climate models and downscaling interpretation and application methods at different timescales were also provided to meet the specific needs of earlier predictions and spatial refinement for the short-term diversion of the reservoir. Our results show that such climate services facilitated the Diversion Center of Danjiangkou Reservoir (DCDR) to reasonably control the operational water level, increased the ecological water supply to the northern portion of China by 844 million m(3), and reduced as much as 1.67 billion m(3) of abandoned water in 2019. In the future, it is necessary to develop climate prediction methods to increase spatial and temporal resolutions and prediction skills, and enhance interactions between providers and users.

Airborne and space-borne optical remote sensing has been successfully used to monitor vegetation phenology in Arctic ecosystems by exploiting the biophysical and biochemical changes associated with vegetation growth and senescence. However, persistent cloud cover and low sun angles in the region make the acquisition of high-quality temporal optical data within one growing season challenging. In the following study, we examine the capability of "near-field" remote sensing technologies, in this case digital, true-color cameras to produce surrogate in situ spectral data to characterize changes in vegetation driven by seasonal pigment dynamics. Simple linear regression was used to investigate relationships between common pigment-driven spectral indices calculated from field-based spectrometry and red, green, and blue (RGB) indices from corresponding digital photographs in three dominant vegetation communities across three major seasons at Toolik Lake, North Slope, Alaska. We chose the strongest and most consistent RGB index across all communities to represent each spectral index. Next, linear regressions were used to relate RGB indices and extracted leaf-level pigment content with a simple additive error propagation of the root mean square error. Results indicate that the green-based RGB indices had the strongest relationship with chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll, while a red-based RGB index showed moderate relationships with the chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio. The results suggest that vegetation color contributes strongly to the response of pigment-driven spectral indices and RGB data can act as a surrogate to track seasonal vegetation change associated with pigment development and degradation. Overall, we find that low-cost, easy-to-use digital cameras can monitor vegetation status and changes related to seasonal foliar condition and photosynthetic activity in three dominant, low-Arctic vegetation communities.

J	Dias, JD; Miracle, MR; Bonecker, CC				Dias, Juliana D.; Miracle, Maria R.; Bonecker, Claudia C.			Do water levels control zooplankton secondary production in Neotropical floodplain lakes?	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Secondary production is an important measure of the functional role of heterotrophic organisms at different trophic levels in an ecosystem. We quantified the production of zooplankton groups during low and high water periods in two shallow lakes on a Neotropical floodplain. Environmental conditions varied markedly between the lakes and between periods. The production of rotifers was greater in the isolated lake due to higher values of chlorophyll-a and lower flushing. In contrast, the production of cladocerans was higher in the connected lake, where fish predation pressure was lower. Diaptomids and cyclopoids exhibited no significant differences in secondary production between the lakes. Water levels influenced the secondary production of the zooplankton groups. Copepods always presented higher production values, but rotifers had greater turnover rates during low water periods. Organisms with smaller body sizes, higher growth rates, and shorter life cycles, such as rotifers, are more rapidly affected by increasing water inflow. Zooplankton groups played different roles in the flow of energy and biomass in the floodplain, being dependent on the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem, which was in turn shaped by environmental heterogeneity and seasonal changes.					; Dias, Juliana/B-3184-2013; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Bonecker, Claudia/D-5946-2013	Bonecker, Claudia/0000-0003-4338-9012; Dias, Juliana/0000-0003-2881-3751; 													1863-9135					APR	2017	190	1					49	62		10.1127/fal/2017/0869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2017/0869													WOS:000403976900004

BPB is defined as sandbar formed at the branching point of a channel where one channel branches into two. MPB is defined as sandbar formed at the merging point of two channels. BPB results from current velocity decrease at the branching point. BPB, arrowhead-shaped and growing towards upstream through upstream accretion, can be divided into bar head, middle and tail. Bar head refers to the lower part of the bar below average low water level, submerges under water whether in rainy seasons or dry seasons, and no plants grow on it. Bar middle refers to the middle part of the bar between average low and average high water levels, and sparse plants grow on it. Bar tail refers to the upper part of the bar above average high water level, and plants grow densely on it. From bar head to bar tail, sediment becomes finer and sorting degree becomes poorer; plant fossils increase in number, and silting-mud layers increase both in number and thickness. Vertically BPB shows a fining-upward sequence. BPB can be classified into 3 types: baby BPB with only bar head, child BPB with bar head and middle, and adult BPB with bar head, middle and tail. Generally from the lower delta plain to upper delta plain, BPB becomes more and more mature. If a channel is suddenly abandoned, BPB at different stages may be preserved. MPB is very similar to BPB in depositional characteristics, and main differences lie in its origin and growth direction. Discovery of BPB and MPB has important implications in finding remaining oil in oilfields. Previously, geologists considered point bars on convex bank of meandering channels or longitudinal bars and transverse bars in the middle of braided channels as favorable locations for finding remaining oil. Our study shows such locations as branching points and merging points of channels are also significant because BPB and MPB develop at these locations. Remaining oil has been found at branching points of channels in Pubei Oilfield, Songliao Basin, Northeast China.					石, 良/KIL-1726-2024														2095-3836					APR	2017	6	2					132	143		10.1016/j.jop.2017.03.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jop.2017.03.001													WOS:000405928800004

At the intersection between toxicology and physiology: What we have learned about sea lampreys and bony fish physiology from studying the mode of action of lampricides	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lampricides 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophemol (TFM) and niclosamide have been used for over 60 years to control the invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) population in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In this review, we summarize these findings in the context of the mode of action of both lampricides, with a focus on: (1) the physiology of uptake, bodily distribution and mode of action, detoxification, and excretion of lampricides in lamprey and non-target fishes, (2) the development of an Adverse Outcome Pathway for TFM and niclosamide, and (3) the identification of novel avenues for future research that can be further explored to ensure continuous suppression of the sea lamprey population in the Great Lakes. We explored how research on the mode of action of lampricides has provided novel insights into the gill microenvironment and how this impacts lampricide toxicity; described new information on mitochondria and tissue physiology; and discussed how the activity of enzymes that are involved in detoxification pathways impacts the response of fishes to xenobiotics. Considering the information that has been generated over the years on sea lamprey and bony fish physiology from studying the mode of action of lampricides, here we propose an Adverse Outcome Pathway for TFM and niclosamide and identify novel avenues for research on the short and long-term effects of lampricide applications, either alone or in combination. Lastly, we discuss how the differences in physiology between sea lampreys and non-target fishes can be further exploited to ensure continuous suppression of the sea lamprey population in the Great Lakes.

Use of water isotopes and chemistry to infer the type and degree of exchange between groundwater and lakes in an esker complex of northeastern Ontario, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												While interactions between groundwater and lake-water influence water chemistry, water balance, aquatic organisms, biochemical cycles and contamination levels, they remain a poorly studied component of lake hydrology. Identifying the controls of groundwater and lake-water interactions at the landscape level and classifying lakes into categories based on their degree of interaction with the groundwater can provide insights into a lake's sensitivity and vulnerability to environmental stressors. Such information can also provide baseline conditions for comparison to future changes that are important for water management and conservation. To this end, water chemistry and water isotopic composition were investigated in a set of 50 boreal lakes located at different elevations in an esker system near Timmins, Ontario. Analyses focused on stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen and specific conductance as indicators of the position of a lake with respect to the influence of groundwater. Both isotopic composition and specific conductance distinguished higher-elevation groundwater-recharge lakes from lower-elevation groundwater-discharge lakes. Groundwater-recharge lakes were high-elevation lakes characterized by enriched isotopic values and low values of specific conductance. In contrast, groundwater-discharge lakes were isotopically depleted and had higher values of specific conductance and occurred at lower elevations. An intermediate group of lakes was also defined (termed seepage lakes) and had intermediate isotopic and water-chemistry characteristics compared to recharge and discharge lakes. Differences in water geochemistry between field campaigns revealed that upland groundwater-recharge lakes showed evidence of evaporative drawdown, indicating sensitivity to short-term changes in climate, whereas the lower-elevation groundwater-discharge lakes showed little variation between seasonal samples and consequently would likely be affected only by hydroclimatological changes of greater duration and magnitude.																			1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 13	2021	25	12					6309	6332		10.5194/hess-25-6309-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6309-2021													WOS:000730167800001

Genomics reveals identity, phenology and population demographics of larval ciscoes (Coregonus artedi, C. hoyi, and C. kiyi) in the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to reliably assign an assemblage of larval coregonines [Salmonidae Coregoninae] to shallow and multiple deepwater species. Larval coregonines from the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior, were genotyped using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and were assigned to species using reference genotypes from adult corgonines from the same region. Of the 193 genotyped larvae, 101 were assigned as Coregonus artedi (average assignment probability = 97.6%), 57 were assigned as C. kiyi (average assignment probability = 95.5%), and 28 were assigned as C. hoyi (average assignment probability = 89.0%). Coregonus artedi were collected earliest in the season, followed by C. kiyi and then C. hoyi. Estimates of genetic diversity within each species provide a baseline for future monitoring in the Apostle Islands. Our success with species assignment indicates the promise of leveraging genomic data for larval coregonine identification, which could enable assessing and evaluating early life history dynamics and recruitment processes at the species level to the benefit of ongoing coregonine restoration and management efforts.

A reintroduced lake sturgeon population comes of age: A genetic evaluation of stocking success in the St. Louis River	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have experienced significant declines throughout the Great Lakes, leading to stocking efforts at some locations to reestablish extirpated populations. Given the late sexual maturity of the species, assessment of stocking program success is often delayed. Lake sturgeon were extirpated from the St. Louis River in western Lake Superior. Stocking began in 1983 and continued until 1994, using the Wolf River (Lake Winnebago) in the Lake Michigan basin as the source. Stocking resumed from 1998 to 2000, using the Sturgeon River in Lake Superior as the source. Our objectives were to (a) determine the movement patterns of stocked Wolf River sturgeon, (b) determine whether stocked individuals are migrating into natural spawning populations during the spawning season, (c) identify the origins of individuals captured in the St. Louis River, and (d) assess the genetic diversity of the reintroduced St. Louis River population. All collected samples were analyzed using 12 microsatellite loci, followed by genetic assignment testing to achieve the first three objectives. Genetic diversity was compared to natural spawning populations in Lake Superior. The highest proportion of stocked Wolf River lake sturgeon was detected in western Lake Superior, close to the stocking site. However, individuals were detected throughout Lake Superior. Wolf River individuals were detected in most of the spawning populations in Lake Superior, with the greatest number in the Sturgeon River and the Goulais River. The majority of individuals captured in the St. Louis River were of stocked origin (88.1%), with 73.5% from the Wolf River and 14.6% from the Sturgeon River. These observed proportions differed from the expected proportions based on the number of sturgeon released from each source (chi(2) = 55.37, p < 0.00001), with a higher representation of Sturgeon River individuals. Evidence of natural recolonization in the St. Louis River was detected from Lake Huron and Goulais River individuals. Genetic diversity of the St. Louis River population was comparable to levels observed in the remnant natural populations in Lake Superior. However, the effective population size of the St. Louis River was small (N-e = 38.1) and average relatedness among individuals was relatively high (r = 0.151). Monitoring of movement of stocked Wolf River sturgeon throughout Lake Superior should continue, with careful attention to the potential for outbreeding depression in remnant populations. Genetic diversity of the St. Louis River population should also continue to be monitored to see if it improves with increased natural reproduction.

This paper presents the results of six-studied Neolithic lake dwellings from Switzerland. A series of natural and anthropogenic site formation processes were identified through micromorphological analysis and have been compared with natural processes in peatlands. The main processes can be summarized as follows: in the littoral zone a carbonate lake marl stratum accumulated prior to construction of the settlement. During lake regressions, the shore platform became dry and the settlements were established. Throughout the period of occupation, anthropogenic processes led to the accumulation of organic layers. The depositional regime can be characterized as paludal, dominated by constant humidity, and rapid covering of the remains. Some parts of the anthropogenic accumulations have been affected by erosion and reworking processes as a result of lake flooding, and runoff from the hinterland. Finally, the degradation of organic matter occurred only during dry phases when the groundwater level dropped. Seasonality was of great importance in this kind of milieu throughout the various processes described above. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The biomass of zooplankton was higher in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone only in the lake having the highest transparency. In the three other lakes, biomass was significantly higher in the pelagic zone than in the littoral zone. In the two lakes with highest transparency, the littoral biomass of cladocerans significantly followed the development of macrophyte vegetation, and cladoceran biomass reached the maximum value at the time of highest macrophyte coverage. In lakes with lowest transparency, littoral zooplankton biomass developed independently of macrophyte density and decreased when macrophyte beds were densest. The seasonal development of the littoral copepod biomass did not follow the development of macrophytes in any of the lakes. The mean size of cladocerans in the pelagic zone decreased with increasing Secchi depth of the lake, whereas in the littoral zone no such phenomenon was detected. Seasonally, when water transparency increased temporarily in two of the lakes, the mean size of cladocerans in the pelagic zone decreased steeply. For copepods, no relationship between water transparency and body size was observed. The results suggested that in humic lakes the importance of the littoral zone as a refuge decreases with decreasing transparency of the water and that low water transparency protects cladocerans from fish predation. All the observed between-lake differences could not be explained by fish predation, but were probably attributed to the presence of chaoborid larvae with variable densities. Feeding efficiency of chaoborids is not affected by visibility and thus they can obscure the relationship between water quality, fish density, and the structure of crustacean zooplankton assemblages.

An integrated approach to improving fossil fuel emissions scenarios with urban ecosystem studies	ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY												The future trajectory of fossil fuel emissions is one of the largest uncertainties in predicting climate change. While global emissions scenarios are ultimately of interest for climate modeling, many of the factors that influence energy and fuel consumption operate on a local rather than global level. However, there have been relatively few comprehensive studies of the ecological and socioeconomic processes that will determine the future trajectory of net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at local and regional scales. We conducted an interdisciplinary, whole ecosystem study of the role of climate, urban expansion, urban form, transportation, and the urban forest in influencing net CO2 emissions in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, a rapidly urbanizing region in the western U.S. Our approach involved a detailed emissions inventory validated with atmospheric measurements, as well as a system dynamics model of future CO2 emissions developed in collaboration with local stakeholders. The model highlighted the importance of a positive feedback between urban land development and transportation investments that may strongly affect emissions by amplifying declines in developmental densities and increases in vehicular traffic. Simulations suggested that while doubling the density of tree planting would have a negligible effect on total urban CO2 emissions, land use and transportation policies that dampen the intensity of the urban sprawl feedback could result in a 22% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 relative to a business as usual scenario. We suggest that by advancing our mechanistic understanding of energy and fuel consumption regionally, this urban ecosystem approach has great potential for improving emissions scenario studies if replicated in other cities and urbanizing regions.

Indigenous fishers' knowledge on fish behavior, fishing practices and climatic conditions in a conservation priority coastal ecosystem in the Caspian Sea	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Besides modern and exogenous knowledge, traditional and Indigenous knowledge of local communities are also needed for proper management and conservation of marine resources. This study aimed at assessing the knowledge of Indigenous Turkmen fishers of Gorgan Gulf which is a conservation priority coastal ecosystem in Caspian Sea, Iran. To do so, an in-field participatory research was done in five villages adjacent to Gorgan Gulf in 2020 using semi-structured interviews and focused group discussion with 48 knowledgeable Turkmen fishers through snowball sampling method. The result showed that Turkmen fishers carried extensive body of knowledge about fish species, their characteristics (size, weight, morphology, behavior), traditional fishing calendar and factors affecting it (including fish spawning time, weather condition, wind types), fishing location, orientation and navigation in fishing, fishing tools and equipment and methods of net placement. Turkmen fishers also described how the quantity, quality and diversity of fish has drastically decreased over time and they mentioned six main reasons for that including exchange of paddling and rowing boats for motor boats; adoption of galvanized nets which replaced cotton nets; decreased possibility and condition of spawning; degradation of shore habitats and decline in fish food leading to fish migration; destruction of small lakes and wetlands adjacent to Caspian Sea and overfishing. In conclusion, considering the role of small-scale fishers in human well-being and food security, their Indigenous and local knowledge must be taken into consideration for natural resources management and conservation.

J	Dawson, HA; Allison, M				Dawson, Heather A.; Allison, Mark			Requirements for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for scientific data collection in the Laurentian Great Lakes: A questionnaire survey	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Using mobile environmental monitoring can aid in gathering ecological data to meet fish community goals in the Great Lakes. One such approach is the use of large Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to gather data, or the potential use of AUV swarms, where multiple small AUVs work together with each having different data-gathering capabilities. To understand data needs that could be collected by mobile sensor networks to inform decision making, we surveyed Great Lakes professionals involved directly and indirectly in such decision making. Basic data that respondents chose as most important to collect were water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, turbidity, and blue-green "algae", which seems to align with variables affecting fish directly or indirectly (through identification of harmful algal blooms). Specialized data chosen as most important were mapping of habitat characteristics, sonar of groupings of fish, and images/video. The time of year to collect all data was chosen as all seasons by the majority of respondents, the frequency most chosen was once a season for mapping of habitat characteristics, once a week for sonar detection of groupings of fish, and once per day for images/video and water temperature. Results were very similar when respondents were asked where data should be collected in the Great Lakes (i.e., tributaries, nearshore areas, etc.) except respondents indicated that images/video should be collected most in fish spawning habitats. Understanding data important to inform decisions of resource professionals will help guide the design of mobile and stationary sensor networks in the Great Lakes.

Given the enormous number of individuals integrating the communities and our limited capacity to count and determine most of them, we likely observe only alternative population peaks of some of the coexisting species. The contemporary coexistence theory addresses coexistence in communities of competing species, considering relative fitness inequalities and stabilising niche differences as components of average long-term growth rates. Here, we experimentally show that the response patterns predicted by the theory occur when varying nutrient pulses fertilise the planktonic community. We used gently self-filling 100-L enclosures to minimise the disturbance of the initial community and different pulse P and N additions to manipulate the apparently species-poor epilimnetic community of an ultraoligotrophic P-limited lake. We measured and compared the protist species growth response to gradients of P enrichment and N stoichiometric imbalance. The P and N levels used in most treatments were within the oligotrophic seasonal and inter-annual variations of the lake and were higher in a few extreme treatments that provided mesotrophic conditions of the remote regions affected by N atmospheric contamination. We alternatively replicated all treatments using ammonium or nitrate as the N source. Most protist species, recorded in this lake across seasons in previous studies, were recovered, indicating a persistent assemblage of species that is seasonally hidden from observation. Recovery included some rare species observed only in the slush layers of the seasonal snow and ice cover. The coexistence-stabilising mechanisms were indicated by treatment response features, such as frequency-dependent growth, inverse relationship between fitness inequality and niche differentiation proxies, high-rank taxonomic levels clustering across the limiting-nutrient gradient but segregation at the species level according to the type of N supply and resting stage development depending on nutrient conditions. The response similarities between autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms indicate a network of interactions that may reinforce coexistence. Synthesis. The results indicate that many planktonic protist species in oligotrophic waters can show stable long-term non-equilibrium coexistence by alternately recovering from very low densities when episodic nutrient enrichments, of varying P and N amounts and composition, occur.

Anthropogenic Changes in the Hydrochemical and Sanitary-Microbiological Characteristics of Water Quality in Southern Baikal Tributaries: Listvennichnyi Bay	WATER RESOURCES												A sanitary-bacteriological and hydrochemical survey of rivers flowing into Lake Baikal near Listvyanka Settl. was carried out in period from 2014 to 2015. Water quality at the mouths of the rivers of Bol'shaya Cheremshanka, Malaya Cheremshanka, and Kamenushka was found not to meet the standards of the normative and technical documentation introduced in Russia and abroad (in the United States and Europe) in terms of thermotolerant coliform bacteria, thermotolerant E. coli, and enterococci. In terms of hydrochemical characteristics, such as phosphates, water quality at the mouths of the Bol'shaya Cheremshanka, Malaya Cheremshanka, and Kamenushka rivers also failed to meet Russian standards. The coastal water of Lake Baikal at the mouth of the Bol'shaya Cheremshanka in July (at the peak of tourist season) 2015 showed the abundance of the group of thermotolerant coliform bacteria (TCB) more than 10 times in excess of the standard. Therefore, the study suggests the conclusion that the quality of water sampled at river mouths is much poorer than that in river reaches upstream of the settlement. Moreover, in July, when the recreational load increases appreciably, the abundance of the analyzed bacteria in water in river reaches within the settlement and in water samples taken upstream of it (background points) is found to differ radically. Hydrochemical and sanitary-bacteriological analysis of the coastal water of Lake Baikal was carried out at the mouths of the rivers flowing into it and revealed an effect of river water on the quality of coastal Baikal water.

Precise radiocarbon dating of the giant Weis landslide (Eastern Alps, Austria)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The landslide of Kofels located in the Otz Valley (Eastern Alps, Austria) is the largest mass movement in crystalline rock in the Alps with a total volume of 3.3 km(3). Previous radiocarbon dates have suggested an age of the event of 9800 +/- 100 years ago. The landslide and its radiocarbon dating were used to estimate a Holocene production rate for Be-10 for surface exposure dating. Tree-ring analysis and radiocarbon dating of new samples significantly refine the timing of the Kofels landslide and even enable to constrain the season during which this event occurred. Wiggle matching analysis of six radiocarbon samples constrains the event to 9527-9498 cal BP which is slightly younger and significantly more precise than the previously established age. The landslide occurred shortly after the onset of the vegetation period, i.e. in May or June. The new dating moves the Kofels landslide strikingly close to the less well constrained age of the Flims landslide, the largest of its kind in the Alps located 130 km west of Kofels (9475-9343 cal BP). This near-synchronicity of these giant mass movements raises the question of a possible common, albeit currently unknown, trigger.

Sources and Deposition of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to Western US National Parks	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Seasonal snowpack, lichens, and lake sediment cores were collected from fourteen lake catchments in eight western U.S. National Parks and analyzed for sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to determine their current and historical deposition, as well as to identify their potential sources. Seasonal snowpack was measured to determine the current wintertime atmospheric PAH deposition; lichens were measured to determine the long-term, year around deposition; and the temporal PAH deposition trends were reconstructed using lake sediment cores dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137. The fourteen remote lake catchments ranged from low-latitude catchments (36.6 degrees N) at high elevation (2900 mast) in Sequoia National Park, CA to high-latitude catchments (68.4 degrees N) at low elevation (427 mast) in the Alaskan Arctic. Over 75% of the catchments demonstrated statistically significant temporal trends in Sigma PAH sediment flux, depending on catchment proximity to source regions and topographic barriers. The Sigma PAH concentrations and fluxes in seasonal snowpack, lichens, and surficial sediment were 3.6 to 60,000 times greater in the Snyder Lake catchment of Glacier National Park than the other 13 lake catchments. The PAH ratios measured in snow, lichen, and sediment were used to identify a local aluminum smelter as a major source of PAHs to the Snyder Lake catchment. These results suggest that topographic barriers influence the atmospheric transport and deposition of PAHs in high-elevation ecosystems and that PAH sources to these national park ecosystems range from local point sources to diffuse regional and global sources.

Here, we theorized that in monsoon regulated tropical coastal lagoons, another important factor that could determine the impact of a cyclone is the landfall season or time of the year with reference to the monsoon season. We analyzed the impact of two cyclones which made landfall near Chilika, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon in different seasons, Cyclone Fani and Titli before and after the monsoon season. We compared field measured and satellite-derived water quality parameters including nutrient, salinity, water temperature, transparency, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) before and after the cyclones. We found that although both the cyclones were of similar intensities, after their land interaction, their impact on the lagoon's water quality was contrasting. The post-monsoon cyclone produced a substantial increase in total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP), a large drop in salinity, CDOM, and Chl-a. In contrast, after the pre-monsoon cyclone, TN and TP did not show any such hike, no substantial change in salinity and CDOM either, and only a slight increase in Chl-a was observed. We found that the controlling factor in determining the impact of a cyclone is the rate and duration of freshwater discharge to the lagoon, which is normally a strong pulse for pre-monsoon and a continued high flow for post-monsoon cyclones. We conclude that the antecedent conditions of the lagoon and the watershed at the time of a cyclone's landfall is a key criterion in determining the impact. The combined use of satellite data and field data was proved critical to capture the overall impact of cyclones on the hydrological characteristics of the monsoon-regulated coastal lagoon.

Mercury in the sediments of Vembanad Lake, western coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mercury, a global pollutant, is popping up in places where it was never expected before and it burdens in sediments and other non-biological materials. It is estimated to have increased up to five times the pre-human level due to anthropogenic activities. Vembanad backwaters, one of the largest Ramsar site in India, which have extraordinary importance for its hydrological function, are now considered as one of the mercury hot spots in India. In this study, surface sediment samples of Vembanad Lake and nearshore areas have been seasonally analysed for total mercury and methyl mercury concentrations while the core sediment samples were analysed for total mercury. The results showed that the northern part of the lake was more contaminated with mercury than the southern part. The mercury concentration was relatively high in the subsurface sediment samples, indicating the possibility of historic industrial mercury deposition. A decreasing trend in the mercury level towards the surface in the core sediment was also observed. The geochemical parameters were also analysed to understand the sediment mercury chemistry. Anoxic conditions, pH and organic carbon, sulphur and Fe determined the presence of various species of mercury in the sediments of Vembanad Lake. The prevailing physical and geochemical conditions in Vembanad Lake have indicated the chances of chemical transformation of mercury and the potential hazard if the deposited mercury fractions are remobilised.					; Mohan, Mahesh/C-3076-2011	Mohan, Mahesh/0000-0003-1003-5357; Ramasamy, E.V./0000-0002-6421-8530													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2014	186	6					3321	3336		10.1007/s10661-014-3620-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3620-1								24452858					WOS:000335156600002

Data were obtained from three excavations and 50 thin-sections. Lake evolution is subdivided into four phases, of which Phases 2 and 3 provided suitable conditions for excellent fossil preservation. Six microfacies are recognized within these two phases: (1) allochthonous, siliciclastic laminae (26.1 mu m thick on average), (2) chrysophycean cyst accumulations, (3) tuffaceous silt, (4) lacustrine chemical precipitates, (5) tuff and (6) normal-graded, sandy to silty siliciclastics. Phase 2 is characterized by Microfacies 1-5 and Phase 3 by Microfacies 6. Biofilms are common, and mass occurrences of framboids (pyrite pseudomorphs) are occurring in sediments of Phase 2. Varves can be verified for Microfacies 2 and 4 (179 mu m thick). Thicknesses of Microfacies 2 highly fluctuate depending on the occurrence of seasonal heavier rains, which led to deposition of tuffaceous silt layers (Microfacies 3). Meromictic conditions dominated Phase 2, but recurrent mixing is demonstrated by short-lived colonization events by a benthic invertebrate fauna. The transition of Phase 2 to holomictic Phase 3 is marked by a dramatic increase in sediment yield associated with a change from dry to humid climates. Fossil preservation differs according to the diverse physical and chemical conditions during lake evolution. Phase 2 yields framboid replacement of organic tissue and excellent preservation of growth increments of clam-shrimp carapaces, which are poorly preserved in Phase 3. Conversely, though exhibiting a different mode of preservation, insect fossils are superbly preserved as dark stains sealed by silica coatings during Phase 3.

Here, we present a comprehensive set of long-term oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope records from 5 Chattian to Burdigalian lacustrine sequences distributed over the Central Anatolian Plateau. Field relationships combined with stable isotope geochemistry indicate a relatively humid subtropic Late Oligocene climate with an environment characterized by large, temporally open freshwater lakes. Approximately during the middle Aquitanian, a 4 parts per thousand-5 parts per thousand increase in lake delta O-18 values indicates changes in regional climate including more arid conditions and an increasing dominance of closed saline lake conditions in the central plateau region. This time period was also characterized by frequent climatic fluctuations such as short-lived humid periods, possibly recording the influence of seasonality, topography, and the waxing and waning of aridity. In general, relatively high Oligo-Miocene delta O-18 lake water values within the modern plateau interior, even for the least evaporative sequences, suggest the absence of significant orographic barriers at both the northern and southern plateau margins prior to 20-16 Ma.

ECOFIT Mbalang Collaborators	Vegetation response to the 'African Humid Period' termination in Central Cameroon (7° N) - new pollen insight from Lake Mbalang	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												A new pollen sequence from the Lake Mbalang (7 degrees 19A ' N, 13 degrees 44A ' E, 1110 m a.s.l.) located on the eastern Adamawa plateau, in Central Cameroon, is presented in this paper to analyze the Holocene African Humid Period (AHP) termination and related vegetation changes at 7 degrees N in tropical Africa, completing an important transect for exploring shifts in the northern margin of the African Monsoon. This sequence, spanning the last 7000 cal yr BP, shows that the vegetation response to this transitional climatic period was marked by significant successional changes within the broad context of long-term aridification. Semi-deciduous/sub-montane forest retreat in this area is initially registered as early as ca. 6100 cal yr BP and modern savannah was definitely established at ca. 3000 cal yr BP and stabilized at ca. 2400 cal yr BP; but a slight forest regeneration episode is observed between ca. 5200 and ca. 4200 cal yr BP. In this area with modern high rainfall, increasing in the length of the dry season during the AHP termination linked to a contraction of the northern margin of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) from ca. 6100 cal yr BP onward, probably associated with decreasing in cloud cover and/or fog frequency, has primarily controlled vegetation dynamics and above all the disappearance of the forested environment on the Adamawa plateau. Compared to previous studies undertaken in northern tropical and Central Africa, this work clearly shows that the response of vegetation to transitional periods between climatic extremes such as the AHP termination might be different in timing, mode and amplitude according to the regional climate of the study sites, but also according to the stability of vegetation before and during these climatic transitions.																			1814-9324	1814-9332					2010	6	3					281	294		10.5194/cp-6-281-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-6-281-2010													WOS:000279390500001

The biogeochemistry of tropical lakes: A case study from Lake Matano, Indonesia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the chemical composition of the water column of Lake Matano, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, to document how the high abundances of Fe (hydr)oxides in tropical soils and minimal seasonal temperature variability affect biogeochemical cycling in lakes. Lake Matano exhibits weak thermal stratification, yet a persistent pycnocline separates an oxic epilimnion from anoxic meta- and hypolimnions. The concentration of soluble P in the epilimnetic waters is very low and can be attributed to scavenging by Fe ( hydr) oxides. Chromium concentrations in the epilimnion are high (up to 180 nmol L-1), but below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for aquatic ecosystems. The concentration of chromium decreases sharply across the oxic-anoxic boundary, revealing that the hypolimnion is a sink for Cr. Flux calculations using a one-dimensional transport-reaction model for the water column fail to satisfy mass balance requirements and indicate that sediment transport and diagenesis play an important role in the exchange of Fe, Mn, P, and Cr between the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Exchange of water between the epilimnion and hypolimnion is slow and on a time scale similar to temperate meromictic lakes. This limits recycling of P and N to the epilimnion and removal of Cr to the hypolimnion, both of which likely restrict primary production in the epilimnion. Owing to the slow exchange, steep concentration gradients in Fe and Mn species develop in the metalimnion. These concentration gradients are conducive to the proliferation of chemoautotrophic and anoxygenic phototrophic microbial communities, which may contribute a significant fraction to the total primary production in the lake.

Three hundred and thirty-six bacterial clones from four clone libraries in different months (March, May, July and September in 2004) were classified into 142 operational taxonomic units, most of which were affiliated with bacterial divisions commonly found in freshwater ecosystem, e.g. Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Actinobacteria. The results showed that the composition of bacterial community in the July library was the most diverse one. Actinobacteria was the most significant lineage in Lake Taihu, with dominant numbers of operational taxonomic units in the May, July and September libraries. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that 53 sequences were grouped into six novel clusters which may represent specific populations indigenous to the environment. Coverage analyses indicated that the clone libraries could provide a fine inventory of bacterial diversity in the lake.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				JUL	2007	61	1					85	96		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00326.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00326.x								17506827					WOS:000247125700008

Spatiotemporal Patterns of Reptile and Amphibian Road Fatalities in a Natura 2000 Area: A 12-Year Monitoring of the Lake Karla Mediterranean Wetland	ANIMALS												Simple Summary The expansion of road networks poses a significant threat to wildlife, particularly reptiles and amphibians, within protected areas (PAs). To address this concern, we examined road mortality patterns among herpetofauna in a Greek-protected wetland over 12 years (2008-2019), utilizing a combination of statistical modeling and spatial analysis. We aimed to identify the most vulnerable species, seasonal variations, and ecological determinants of roadkill patterns. Across 14 documented species, 340 roadkill incidents were recorded, with snakes comprising over 60% of encounters. Both environmental and road-related factors significantly influenced roadkill risk. Spatial analysis techniques pinpointed critical hotspots, particularly in the southeastern region of the study area. These findings highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies to protect herpetofauna within this PA. Understanding the specific factors influencing roadkill patterns is crucial for implementing effective conservation measures and safeguarding these vulnerable species.Abstract The pervasive expansion of human-engineered infrastructure, particularly roads, has fundamentally reshaped landscapes, profoundly affecting wildlife interactions. Wildlife-vehicle collisions, a common consequence of this intricate interplay, frequently result in fatalities, extending their detrimental impact within Protected Areas (PAs). Among the faunal groups most susceptible to road mortality, reptiles and amphibians stand at the forefront, highlighting the urgent need for global comprehensive mitigation strategies. In Greece, where road infrastructure expansion has encroached upon a significant portion of the nation's PAs, the plight of these road-vulnerable species demands immediate attention. To address this critical issue, we present a multifaceted and holistic approach to investigating and assessing the complex phenomenon of herpetofauna road mortality within the unique ecological context of the Lake Karla plain, a rehabilitated wetland complex within a PA. To unravel the intricacies of herpetofauna road mortality in the Lake Karla plain, we conducted a comprehensive 12-year investigation from 2008 to 2019. Employing a combination of statistical modeling and spatial analysis techniques, we aimed to identify the species most susceptible to these encounters, their temporal and seasonal variations, and the ecological determinants of their roadkill patterns. We documented a total of 340 roadkill incidents involving 14 herpetofauna species in the Lake Karla's plain, with reptiles, particularly snakes, being more susceptible, accounting for over 60% of roadkill occurrences. Moreover, we found that environmental and road-related factors play a crucial role in influencing roadkill incidents, while spatial analysis techniques, including Kernel Density Estimation, the Getis-Ord Gi*, and the Kernel Density Estimation plus methods revealed critical areas, particularly in the south-eastern region of Lake Karla's plain, offering guidance for targeted interventions to address both individual and collective risks associated with roadkill incidents.					; Zevgolis, Yiannis G,/HZI-3994-2023; Christopoulou, Aikaterini/LNQ-3146-2024; Dimitrakopoulos, Panayiotis G./AAB-1182-2022	Kouris, Alexandros D./0009-0000-9417-1107; Christopoulou, Aikaterini/0000-0001-9928-141X; G.

Developing a daily reservoir evaporation data set is necessary for reservoir operations to consider the influence of evaporation in a timely manner. However, over the past few decades, the quantification of reservoir evaporation has primarily relied on monthly Class A pan evaporation observations, which might lead to largely biased estimations because they do not incorporate the effects of heat storage and fetch. In this study, we developed a general Daily Lake Evaporation Model (DLEM) based on Penman's equation combined with daily atmospheric reanalysis data sets, to improve the validity and frequency of reservoir evaporation monitoring. Compared with daily evaporation estimates from eddy covariance systems, the DLEM showed good quality and reliability, with R2 values ranging from 0.50 to 0.73 and RMSE values ranging from 1.13 to 1.97 mm day-1 in four different sites. By applying DLEM to all 188 major reservoirs in Texas, we generated a long-term data set of (1 January 1981-31 December 2021) daily evaporation rates. The results reveal a clear geographic distribution and strong seasonality of evaporation throughout Texas, where the mean evaporation rate is highest during July, with 6.85 mm day-1. Trend analysis indicates that the annual average evaporation rate has significantly increased since 1981 at a rate of 0.076 mm day-1 decade-1. This study provides sufficient data support for water resource operations and management, and regional water planning.

The evolution of Palaeolake Flixton and the environmental context of Star Carr: an oxygen and carbon isotopic record of environmental change for the early Holocene	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												This paper presents delta O-18 and delta C-13 values from three early Holocene lacustrine carbonate sequences from Palaeolake Flixton in northeastern England. The delta C-13 values are typical of carbonates precipitating in an open lake system with the exception of samples from the very uppermost parts of these sequences which have values more typical of palustrine or tufaceous carbonates and, therefore, indicate the progressive contraction and shrinkage of the lake system oveftime. The delta O-18 values record an initial increase to an early peak at the onset of the Holocene but a subsequent decline in values of such a magnitude that by ca 8000 yrs B.P. the delta O-18 value of the precipitated carbonate is consistent with carbonates that precipitated at the end of the Loch Lomond Stadial. The early increase and peak in delta O-18 values is suggested to reflect the climatic amelioration at the onset of the Holocene, as temperatures progressively rose. The decline cannot be explained by any known temperature shifts, however, this "depletion trend" is seen in several other early Holocene lacustrine records from across the British Isles. This decline is suggested to reflect a shift in the seasonality of precipitation from a more seasonal precipitation regime typical of a "continental" climate, with strong seasonal contrasts in rainfall, to a more "maritime" climate which was characterised by consistent levels of rainfall occurring across the year. The relative timing of human activity at Star Carr suggests human occupation occurred after this isotopic decline under "maritime" rather than "continental" climates.

J	Ishii, N; Ishida, S; Kagami, M				Ishii, Nobuyoshi; Ishida, Seiji; Kagami, Maiko			PCR primers for assessing community structure of aquatic fungi including Chytridiomycota and Cryptomycota	FUNGAL ECOLOGY												Fungi are diverse and have the potential for material cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Species composition of aquatic fungi and their seasonal dynamics are often key to their role in the functioning of the ecosystems. However, community structure of aquatic fungi, especially of Chytridiomycota (Chytrids) and Cryptomycota, is still limited because few primer sets are available to examine species composition. In this study, we validated six primer sets for the detection of aquatic fungi by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and found that FF390W/EF3r showed the highest specificity among the primer sets tested. We detected both Chytrids and Cryptomycota from Lake Inba by DGGE analysis using the FF390W/EF3r-GC primer set. Further study with our established analysis revealed community structures of aquatic fungi and their seasonal succession patterns in the lake. Results of our study are useful for selection of the primer set for studying community structures of aquatic fungi and their seasonal succession.

Quantifying the N compounds in wet deposition and determining their sources is important to understand how to control eutrophication in lakes and to improve recommendations for fertilizer use. In this study, the concentrations of inorganic N, molar ratios of NH4+/NO3- and the natural N-15 abundance of NH4+ (delta(NH4+)-N-15) in wet deposition were determined for 78 precipitation events between June 2003 and July 2005. Samples were collected at two sites in Tai lake region, a watershed rice agroecosystem currently experiencing eutrophication. The average N wet deposition amounted to 27 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), with 60% in the form of NH4+. Annually, two cycles of depleted and enriched delta(NH4+)-N-15 indicate the shifting of main source of NH3 volatilization between chemical fertilizer and excreta of local residents and domestic animals, surface waters, and other organic N. The peak in NH4+/NO3- ratio, coupled with depleted delta(NH4+)-N-15 in mid-June, coincided with the fice-transplanting period, which is indicative of surplus fertilizer application. Enriched delta(NH4+)-N-15 values in August-October and in April-May were indicative of enhanced emissions from excreta and polluted waterbodies in the warmer seasons. Findings suggest that delta(NH4+)-N-15 could be used to indicate the sources of NH3 volatilization, and the NH4+/NO3- ratio to indicate the intensity of wet N deposition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Long-term spatiotemporal patterns of water quality in a South Korean estuarine reservoir were analyzed using seasonal datasets from 2002 to 2020, and some functional changes in relations of trophic state variables due to the construction of serial weirs in the upper river were also investigated. A total of 19 water quality parameters were used for the study, including indicators of organic matter, nutrients, suspended solids, water clarity, and fecal pollution. In addition, chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) was used to assess algal biomass. An empirical regression model, trophic state index deviation (TSID), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied. Longitudinal fluctuations in nutrients, organic matter, sestonic CHL-a, and suspended solids were found along the axis of the riverine (Rz), transition (Tz), and lacustrine zones (Lz). The degradation of water quality was seasonally caused by resuspension of sediments, monsoon input due to rainfall inflow, and intensity of Asian monsoon, and was also related to intensive anthropic activities within the catchment. The empirical model and PCA showed that light availability was directly controlled by non-algal turbidity, which was a more important regulator of CHL-a than total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The TSID supported our hypothesis on the non-algal turbidity. We also found that the construction of serial upper weirs influenced nutrient regime, TSS, CHL-a level, and trophic state in the estuarine reservoir, resulting in lower TP and TN but high CHL-a and high TN/TP ratios. The proportions of both dissolved color clay particles and blue-green algae in the TSID additionally increased. Overall, the long-term patterns of nutrients, suspended solids, and algal biomass changed due to seasonal runoff, turnover time, and reservoir zones along with anthropic impacts of the upper weir constructions, resulting in changes in trophic state variables and their mutual relations in the estuarine reservoir.

An Analysis of Monitoring Data from 504 Danish Lakes	SUSTAINABILITY												Cross-latitude studies on lakes have a potential to predict how global warming may cause major changes in phytoplankton biomass and composition, e.g., the development of favourable conditions for cyanobacteria dominance. However, results from these studies may be influenced by biogeographical factors, and the conclusions may, therefore, not hold when considering local response patterns. We used monthly monitoring data from 504 lakes in Denmark-a small and homogeneous geographical region-to establish empirical relationships between key phytoplankton groups and a set of explanatory variables including total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), lake mean depth (DEP) and water temperature (TEMP). All variables had strong effects on phytoplankton biomass and composition, but their contributions varied over the seasons, with TEMP being particularly important in June-October. We found dominance of cyanobacteria in terms of biomass and also an increase in dinophytes biomass at higher TEMP, while diatoms and chlorophytes became less important. In May, however, the TEMP effect on total phytoplankton biomass was negative, likely reflecting intensified zooplankton grazing. Our results suggest that biogeographical effects are of minor importance for the response patterns of phytoplankton to temperature and that substantial concentration reductions of TN and TP are needed in eutrophic lakes to counteract the effect of the climate change-induced increase in TEMP.					; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; 														2071-1050				DEC	2021	13	24							14049	10.3390/su132414049	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132414049													WOS:000737421300001

Great efforts in control and prevention of the disease, including universal vaccination campaigns in poultry and active serological and virological surveillance, have been undertaken in mainland China since the beginning of 2006. In this study, we aim to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of HPAI H5N1, and identify influencing factors favoring the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in mainland China. Our study shows that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks took place sporadically after vaccination campaigns in poultry, and mostly occurred in the cold season. The positive tests in routine virological surveillance of HPAI H5N1 virus in chicken, duck, goose as well as environmental samples were mapped to display the potential risk distribution of the virus. Southern China had a higher positive rate than northern China, and positive samples were mostly detected from chickens in the north, while the majority were from duck in the south, and a negative correlation with monthly vaccination rates in domestic poultry was found (R = -0.19, p value = 0.005). Multivariate panel logistic regression identified vaccination rate, interaction between distance to the nearest city and national highway, interaction between distance to the nearest lake and wetland, and density of human population, as well as the autoregressive term in space and time as independent risk factors in the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, based on which a predicted risk map of the disease was derived. Our findings could provide new understanding of the distribution and transmission of HPAI H5N1 in mainland China and could be used to inform targeted surveillance and control efforts in both human and poultry populations to reduce the risk of future infections.					; Li, Xin-lou/ABF-8578-2021; Fang, Li-Qun/GWD-0296-2022; Chen, Wei-Ju/AAE-6048-2022; liu, kun/KIG-6121-2024	Li, Xinlou/0000-0002-7743-0856; de Vlas, Sake J./0000-0002-1830-5668; 													1660-4601					MAY	2015	12	5					5026	5045		10.3390/ijerph120505026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph120505026								26006118					WOS:000359190300032

Our question was, whether ten year changes in regional Odonata faunas are comparable between farmland and forested areas, or if the species pool of farmland areas respond in other ways than that of forest. We used data of dragonfly larvae collected from 16 lakes in a farmland area in south-western Sweden in the years 2002 and 2011/12, and compared these to data from 34 lakes in a forest area in south-eastern Sweden in the years 1996 and 2006. The species-richness in the agricultural region increased by 17% but decreased by 13% in the forested region. The changes in occurrence and regional distribution were similar in both areas, affecting 71% and 69% of the species pool. Average extinction rates were comparable between the agricultural and the forested region (38% and 43%) while colonisation rates differed greatly (64% and 114%). The species composition differed between the regions; the forest lakes harboured a 29% larger species pool. It is possible that in the forested region, the regional species pool in areas surrounding the study sites could stabilise the extinction and have a positive effect on changes in species composition. We assume that the different habitat structures of the waters in the agricultural and the forest regions and changes in temperature are the main driving forces behind the shifts. The mean seasonal air temperature has increased by circa 0.5 degrees C in both regions, when comparing ten-year periods before each sampling year.																			1752-458X	1752-4598				JAN	2014	7	1					22	31		10.1111/icad.12034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12034													WOS:000330863500003

Resource use among top-level piscivores in a temperate reservoir: implications for a threatened coldwater specialist	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Evaluations of resource use among native piscivores in natural lakes have consistently documented significant partitioning that supports coexistence. Partitioning may be less prominent in reservoirs where water-level fluctuations can compress habitat and trophic diversity, but studies are lacking. Stable isotopes and bioenergetic models were used to quantify trophic interactions within a native piscivore assemblage inhabiting a temperate irrigation reservoir and explore implications for coexistence with a focus on threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). As hypothesised, adult bull trout exhibited the greatest degree of trophic specialisation by consuming mostly coldwater pelagic forage fish, which were consumed seasonally by the more abundant burbot (Lota lota) and northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis). Numerous trophic niche overlap probabilities exceeded 70%, were as high as 93% and greatest between bull trout and burbot. Bioenergetics simulations demonstrated the high seasonal consumption capacity of burbot relative to northern pikeminnow. As a result, threefold to fourfold fewer burbot were required to consume the annual productivity of coldwater prey important for bull trout, particularly in the absence of small-bodied mesothermic or eurythermal fish as a buffer. Collectively, our analysis elucidated relatively strong trophic niche overlap among similarly sized piscivores, the importance of maintaining a diverse forage fish community for promoting coexistence and the greatest potential for competitive interactions between adult bull trout and burbot if key prey were limited or less diverse. More studies in regulated systems are needed to test for consistent patterns and identify mechanisms that limit or promote coexistence amid growing human-induced environmental change and demands on freshwater.

The Yangtze River Basin (YRB) is seriously threatened by multiple stressors leading to rapid biodiversity declines, thus urgently requires an integrated biodiversity conservation. Based on field samplings and the literatures, we described the macrozoobenthos compositions in different reaches and water bodies. We then predicted suitable habitat areas for the main groups, and linked those distributions with key environmental variables. Finally, we analyzed biodiversity hotspots (BHs) of macrozoobenthos and compared them with BHs of large aquatic animals (including fishes, Waterfowls, Yangtze finless porpoise, etc.), and discussed the applicability of selecting macrozoobenthos as biodiversity surrogate for biodiversity conservation. A total of 1033 taxa were recorded. From the upper to lower of YRB, genera number of Oligochaeta and Mollusca increased, of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) decreased, and of Chironomidae barely changed. In different water bodies, genera number of Oligochaeta, Mollusca, Chironomidae are the highest in lakes of the mid-lower YRB, while that of EPT are the highest in tributaries. Key environmental variables were water body types, elevation and max temperature of the warmest month. The total BHs areas of macrozoobenthos and large aquatic animals in the upper, and mid-lower YRB were 3.54 x 10(5) km(2) and 2.95 x 10(5) km(2), 2.95 x 10(5) km(2) and 1.70 x 10(5) km(2), respectively. The overlapping BHs were 2.0 x 10(5) km(2) and 1.1 x 10(5) km(2), respectively. The BHs of macrozoobenthos had a wider range, and included most BHs of large aquatic animals. Meanwhile, BHs of macrozoobenthos could indicate some habitats those were difficult to cover by selecting large aquatic animals as conservation targets, e.g., seasonal streams and water bodies that suffered from human disturbances. Based on these results, we argue that macrozoobenthos is a good biodiversity surrogate for biodiversity conservation.

Longitudinal trends and discontinuities in nutrients, chlorophyll, and suspended solids in the Upper Mississippi River: implications for transport, processing, and export by large rivers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Across the distances spanned by large rivers, there are important differences in catchment characteristics, tributary inputs, and river morphology that may cause longitudinal changes in nutrient, chlorophyll, and suspended solids concentrations. We investigated longitudinal and seasonal patterns in the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) using long-term data (1994-2005) from five study reaches that spanned 1300 km of the UMR. Lake Pepin, a natural lake in the most upstream study reach, had a clear effect on suspended material in the river. Suspended solids and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were substantially lower downstream of the lake and percent organic material (OM%) in suspension was higher. Below L. Pepin, mean total and organic suspended solids (TSS, OSS) and TP increased downriver and exhibited approximately log-linear relationships with catchment area, whereas OM% declined substantially downriver. Despite the downriver increase in TSS and OSS, concentrations similar to those above L. Pepin do not occur until similar to 370 km downriver indicating the extent of the influence of L. Pepin on the UMR. Chlorophyll concentrations were lower in the most downstream study reach, likely reflecting the shorter residence time and poor light climate, but there was not a consistent longitudinal decline in chlorophyll across the study reaches. Dissolved silica (DSi), DSi:TN, and DSi:TP declined downriver suggesting that DSi uptake and sedimentation by river phytoplankton may be reducing DSi transport in the river, and indicating that the eutrophication of the river may contribute to a reduction of DSi export to the Gulf of Mexico.

Linking physiography and evaporation using the isotopic composition of river water in 16 Canadian boreal catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Highly seasonal boreal catchments are hydrologically complex and generally data poor and, hence, are ripe for investigation using tracer-aided hydrologic models. The influence of physiography on isotopic metrics was assessed to identify the catchment characteristics dominating evaporative enrichment. A multiyear stable isotope of water dataset was collected at the outlets of 16 boreal catchments in central Canada ranging in area from 12 to 15,282km(2). Physiographic characteristics were obtained through raster analysis of freely available land cover images, stream networks, and digital elevation models. Correlation analysis indicated that as the percentage coverage of open water increased, so too did the evaporative effects observed at the catchment outlet. Correlation to wetland metrics indicated that increasing the percentage coverage of wetlands can reduce or increase evaporative effects observed, depending on the isotopic metric used and the corresponding drainage density, catchment slope, and presence of headwater lakes. The slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines appear to reflect multifaceted relationships, strongest between catchment slope, headwater lakes, and connected wetlands, whereas mean line-conditioned excess is more directly linked to physiographic variables. Hence, the slopes of river evaporative-mixing lines and mean line-conditioned excess are not interchangeable metrics of evaporative enrichment in a catchment. Relationships identified appear to be independent of catchment scale. These results suggest that adequate inclusion of the distribution of open water throughout a catchment, adequate representation of wetland processes, catchment slope, and drainage density are critical characteristics to include in tracer-aided hydrologic models in boreal environments in order to minimize structural uncertainty.					; Stadnyk, Tricia/ABC-8061-2021	Stadnyk, Tricia/0000-0002-2145-4963; Welch, Chani/0000-0003-0542-872X; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 15	2018	32	2					170	184		10.1002/hyp.11396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11396													WOS:000422753200001

The results revealed the exogenous input of HMs should be more prominent in wet season, due to the higher concentration and EF values. PMF identified HMs were mainly from natural, mining and industrial sources. The input of exogenous HMs were influenced by mining and industrial sources in wet season, but primarily by industrial sources in dry season. HI values were overall below 1, suggesting the relatively low non -carcinogenic risk. The TCR values of HMs were generally beyond 10-6, particularly those of As and Cr even exceeded 10-4 for children, which expressed a high carcinogenic risk. The sources components of As and Cr suggested preventing the migration of mining contaminants and limiting industrial emission should be essential to Liujiang River Basin.

Arden, III			A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of Elementary School Absences and Fine Particulate Air Pollution	MEDICINE												Fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) has been associated with many adverse health outcomes including school absences. Specifically, a previous study in the Utah Valley area, conducted during a time with relatively high air pollution exposure, found significant positive correlations between school absences and air pollution. We examined the hypothesis that ambient PM2.5 exposures are associated with elementary school absences using a quasi-natural experiment to help control for observed and unobserved structural factors that influence school absences. The Alpine, Provo, and Salt Lake City school districts are located in valleys subject to daily mean PM2.5 concentrations almost twice as high as those in the Park City School District. We used seminonparametric generalized additive Poisson regression models to evaluate associations between absences and daily PM2.5 levels in the 3 districts that were exposed to the most pollution while using Park City absences as a quasi-control. The study covered 3 school years (2011/12-2013/14). School absences were most strongly associated with observed structural factors such as seasonal trends across school years, day-of-week effects, holiday effects, weather, etc. However, after controlling for these structural factors directly and using a control district, a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with an approximately 1.7% increase in daily elementary school absences. Exposure to ambient air pollution can contribute to elementary school absences, although this effect is difficult to disentangle from various other factors.

This also applies to waters with a moderate pool of biogenic resources which, following temporarily increased nutrient alimentation from the catchment area may become eutrophic. The in-situ experiment tested the impact of chemical restoration on benthic macroalgae (Chara hispida L.) found in meso-eutrophic waters. Commonly used doses of iron sulphate were applied, defined as Low - 10.8 g Fe m(-2) and High - 21.6 g Fe m(-2). It was presumed that the sudden shift of abiotic conditions of the environment will disturb growth and stoichiometry of the species. Analyses encompassed physicochemical water parameters (e.g. nutrient concentration, light availability), morphological features and elemental composition of the charophytes. Application of the coagulant caused shading of the plants and elimination of bioavailable phosphates from the water. This induced changes of behavioural ecology of the species, manifesting in elongation of the main axis and increase of the assimilation area (growth of branchlets and side-axes) as well as stoichiometric changes. It was found that shortage of phosphates in the water resulted in decreased phosphorus concentration in the thalli due to biological dilution. The increase of assimilation area and phosphorus dilution in the thalli have not been previously reported for charophytes. In this study, the qualitative transformation of the environment following application of iron as part of chemical lake restorationwas evinced in significant ecological changes that adversely affected macrophytobenthos. The findings of the experiment can therefore be taken into account while planning restoration procedures, so as to preclude the risk of a negative trend of ecological changes. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

From April to May 2011, we carried out a survey to quantify carnivore-induced livestock losses perceived by local pastoralists in the Qinghai Lake region on the pastoral Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and examined the ecological and socio-economic dimensions in the conflict. We finished 286 in-person interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire with mixed closed-and open-ended questions. Our results showed that 93.7% of the respondents reported livestock depredations by carnivores from March 2010 to March 2011. The perceived losses represented 3.7% of total standing value of livestock in the region. The losses were positively correlated with livestock number in each household and showed significant seasonal and diurnal difference. Adult sheep and goats were the mostly killed (54.9%), followed by lambs (21.0%), adult yaks and cattle (19.1%), calves (4.9%) and horses (0.1%). More than 80% of the respondents reported that they could not tolerate the contemporaneous depredations and nearly two thirds expected compensations for their losses. Wolf Canis lupus was blamed for most of the killings (76.0%) and was perceived most negative followed by brown bear Ursus arctos, Tibetan fox Vulpes ferrilata, red fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Attitudes toward the problem carnivores were positively correlated with livestock size but negatively with magnitudes of the depredations. The attitudes also varied among the three survey sites, which may be attributed to the different extent of openness and livelihood dependence on animal husbandry. In the light of our results, we suggested possible measures to mitigate the conflict and maintain coexistence between human and wild carnivores on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

For better understanding the shift of dry-season lake level, we quantified the variations induced by channel changes of the river-lake system (CCORLS). Attempts were achieved through establishing two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based water level prediction models, combined hydrological data in the periods of 1956-2000 and 2006-2016. The results indicated that: (1) With reference to earlier (1956-2000) dry periods, the recent (2006-2016) mean water levels had an overall decreasing trend, with values of 0.04-1.26 m across the lake. (2) The response of water level to CCORLS was spatially heterogeneous, triggering a sharp reduction in the central to northern lake, an obvious reduction in the lake outlet, and a relatively smaller reduction in the southern lake. (3) The bottom topography alteration of Poyang Lake made a dominating contribution to decline the lake water levels, while the Yangtze River's mainstream channel near the lake played a minor role in the decrease of water level. Results shed light on the impact of systematic watercourse changes on the water level of a lake connected a river and enhanced understanding of the characteristics and mechanisms behind the hydrological changes of large freshwater lakes.

The water mass balance is an essential subject to take into account in water management activities. The level changes of a lake Surface are an indicator of the water mass balance of a basin since they reflect the water storage variations. Space borne altimeters have been Successfully used in the last decade to measure lakes, rivers and wetland stages. This study presents the first analysis of Lake Izabal - the biggest lake of Guatemala (Central America) - water level fluctuations using altimetry, data and in-situ measurements. Water level variations were obtained from Envisat Radar Altimeter (RA-2) Geophysical Data Records Coupled with in-situ measurements. The analysis period included three complete years (2004 to 2006). The rainfall and temperature records over the catchment were analyzed considering that the amount of water feeding the lake, either by the tributaries and/or the groundwater, is driven by the climatic conditions over the lake's catchment. The results obtained show a good agreement between both, altimeter and in-situ datasets (correlation coefficient: 0.83 and rms error: 0.09 m). Lake Izabal water level fluctuations have a seasonal signal forced by the rainy and dry climate seasons in the region. An abrupt lake level rise was found in July 2006 which is correlated to abnormal precipitations in June. We found a connection between the higher/lower extreme values in the lake level variations with rainfall anomalies produced by regional climate changes forced by El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Tropical North Atlantic anomaly.

Numerous regions have implemented beneficial management practices to combat agricultural nonpoint pollution, often evaluating efficacy at the field scale, but not downstream. In this study, we conducted an extensive, 11-year (2010-2020), all-season, weekly monitoring program in a small, shallow, hypereutrophic lake and main tributary located in a cold climate, northern temperate zone, within a predominantly agricultural-forested mesoscale watershed. The monitoring took place before and after the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures in the catchment, allowing assessment of changes over time in the downstream tributary and lake. We analyzed long-term trends and temporal change points for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, aquatic trophic status, and nutrient stoichiometric ratios. The results revealed significant reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, improved lake trophic status from hypereutrophic to eutrophic, and an increase in total nitrogen : total phosphorus ratios following the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures. Notably, both the lake and its main tributary exhibited significant temporal change points for these parameters. Our findings offer evidence of a relatively rapid, positive effect of the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures contributing to subsequent improvements in downstream water quality.					; Sauve, Sebastien/K-5671-2012; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Tromas, Nicolas/MGB-4006-2025; Julian, Paul/ABB-5826-2020; Simon, Dana/R-4716-2019	Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Phan, Dawson/0000-0002-6391-7057; Sauve, Sebastien/0000-0001-8584-1690; Tromas, Nicolas/0000-0003-4332-8463; Simon, Dana/0000-0003-3725-2482; Husk, Barry/0000-0002-5993-1024; Julian, Paul/0000-0002-7617-1354; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR	2024	354								120411	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120411		FEB 2024						38382438					WOS:001188406200001

This glacier is in southwest Greenland, which has active glacial meltwater.Study focus: Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) are an essential part of the hydrological systems of ice sheets, and their development is vital for determining the stability of ice sheets. This paper use 188 scenes of Landsat images during the melting season from 2000 to 2020 with Google Earth Engine to analyze the seasonal changes of the SGLs. New hydrological insights: 1) The area, volume, and depth of the SGLs, increased, indicating the increasing melt in this area from 2000 to 2020. 2) the SGLs development peaked at 190-200 days of the year. The melting area significantly expanded at the initial stage, while the melting depth change was more significant than the area at the later stage. 3) The elevation reached by the SGLs advanced approximately 300 m inland from 1400 m to 1700 m elevation. The convergence of small lakes (<0.25 km2), the reappearance of buried lakes, and the distribution of SGLs zone shift inland occurred during the SGLs development. 4) High recurrence lake area was mostly below 2 km2, and the recurrence rate of water were related to geographical factors.

Lethally and non-lethally sampled tissues often differ in their stable isotope ratios due to differences in metabolic turnover rate and isotopic routing. If not accounted for when using non-lethal tissues, these differences may result in inaccurate estimates of resource use and trophic position derived from stable isotopes. To address this, the authors tested whether tissue type, season and their interaction influence the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of fishes and whether estimates of species trophic position and resource use are affected by tissue type, season and their interaction. This study developed linear conversion relationships between two fin types and dorsal muscle, accounting for seasonal variation. The authors focused on three common temperate freshwater fishes: northern pike Esox lucius, yellow perch Perca flavescens and lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis. They found that fins were enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15 compared to muscle in all three species, but the effect of season and the interaction between tissue type and season were species and isotope dependent. The estimates of littoral resource use based on fin isotope ratios were between 13% and 36% greater than those based on muscle across species. Season affected this difference for some species, suggesting the potential importance of using season-specific conversions when working with non-lethal tissues. Fin and muscle stable isotopes produced similar estimates of trophic position for northern pike and yellow perch, but fin-based estimates were 0.2-0.4 trophic positions higher than muscle-based estimates for lake whitefish. The effect of season was negligible for estimates of trophic position in all species. Strong correlations existed between fin and muscle delta C-13 and delta N-15 values for all three species; thus, linear conversion relationships were developed. The results of this study support the use of non-lethal sampling in stable isotope studies of fishes. The authors suggest that researchers use tissue conversion relationships and account for seasonal variation in these relationships when differences between non-lethal tissues and muscle, and seasonal effects on those differences, are large relative to the scale of isotope values under investigation and/or the trophic discrimination factors under use.					; Poesch, Mark/G-1013-2011	Roberts, Karling/0000-0003-1241-7922; Hayden, Brian/0000-0002-8524-7373; 													0022-1112	1095-8649				JAN	2022	100	1					229	241		10.1111/jfb.14939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14939		NOV 2021						34739138					WOS:000721776100001

Enriched dissolved organic carbon export from a residential stormwater pond	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In urban watersheds, stormwater retention ponds are intermediate junctions that capture, store, and discharge stormwater, and provide an organic-rich environment that transforms and retains nutrients and other constituents. This study investigated the concentrations and loads of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) in discharges from a stormwater retention pond that receives runoff from a residential catchment. We installed an autosampler, a flowmeter, and a rain gauge at the outlet (weir) of the stormwater retention pond and collected samples from 13 storm events during the 2016 wet season (May-September). Results showed the dominance of DOC (11.2 mg L-1) over POC (0.6 mg L-1) in the pond discharges. The elevated DOC levels in the pond were close to eutrophic lakes and ponds (similar to 10.3 mg L-1), but not statistically different from urban runoff at a nearby site. High-frequency monitoring of pond discharge waters showed that DOC concentrations peaked at the beginning of storm events due to initial surface runoff following a rainstorm (first-flush effect). Rainfall samples analysis suggested that precipitation accounted for a small fraction of DOC pool, but carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios supported that in situ aquatic sources could dominate DOC inputs in some storms. Relative to DOC, the first-flush effect was even more apparent for POC, and POC inputs from in situ aquatic sources were more common based on C/N ratios. The calculated export of total organic C (TOC = DOC + POC) was 22.5 kg ha(-1) over the observed events, and the estimated export was 33.8 kg ha(-1) over the 2016 wet season. Our data suggest that reducing high DOC export from residential stormwater ponds warrant controls on both inputs from the watershed and in situ aquatic sources. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Fuerstenau; Georgiadis, George; Campello, Silvana; Brandao, Reuber A.; Ciuti, Simone			Improving river dolphin monitoring using aerial surveys	ECOSPHERE												Obtaining correct abundance estimates to model population dynamics and promptly adjust management actions is a key goal of threatened species conservation. For elusive aquatic mammals like river dolphins, however, gathering such basic data can be extremely challenging. River dolphins in shallow waters are surveyed from canoes, with the (untested) assumption that visual counts are exhaustive estimates of animal population. These counts, however, should take into consideration that river dolphins usually emerge for very short periods and show very little of their body when surfacing. Recently, aerial survey methods have been introduced as new technology aiming to improve the reliability of wildlife censuses. Herein, we developed and tested a new survey method using a digital camera mounted on a blimp (non-rigid airship system) for aerial survey of river dolphins. We conducted our experiment by surveying the recently described Araguaian river dolphin (Inia araguaiaensis) during the low water season in the Parque Estadual do Cantaao, a seasonally flooded lake system in the Amazonian forest, Brazil. Our survey, which was designed to monitor the river dolphin in 56 survey units within six main survey sectors, implied deploying two canoes navigating simultaneously: the first one with a single operator holding the blimp and recording data from its camera and the second one with three observers performing standard visual counts of dolphins. In contrast to common expectations, visual counts detected on average <75% of the dolphins recorded by the blimp's camera. Compared to the visual survey, the aerial method was able to detect more individuals, more dolphin groups, and to record more calves, which are usually difficult to detect. The differences in performance between the two methods were remarkable when surveyed sectors were larger. We showed that visual counts from canoes are less exhaustive surveys than aerial surveys, and provided a less expensive method (one operator needed to handle the blimp, compared to three visual observers) to count aquatic mammals. Our results can be used to correct current visual count estimates. With further development of blimps and drones in wildlife surveys, we foresee a promising future for the conservation and management of threatened species.

Potentially Toxic Trace Metals in Water and Lake-Bed Sediment of Panchpokhari, an Alpine Lake Series in the Central Himalayan Region of Nepal	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study assessed the level of potentially toxic trace metals (PTMs), seasonal variations, and their possible sources from the surface water and lake-bed sediment of Panchpokhari lake series, an alpine and glacial lake at 4160 m a.s.l. in Central Nepal. The lake series have five lakes, with Lake-1 larger than others. So, Lake-1 was investigated thoroughly during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Sediment core was collected from the deepest basin of the Lake-1 during pre-monsoon. Most of the PTM concentrations were higher in the pre-monsoon season; however, Sc, Cr, Cu, Zn, As, and Ag were higher in the post-monsoon. This is an indication that the lake has been impacted either by natural or long-range transported atmospheric pollutants. Ti, Sb, and Ag had extremely high enrichment factor (EF) in waters, whereas Cd, Zn, and As had high EF in sediments indicating that these metals originated from anthropogenic sources. Furthermore, PTM concentrations in the sediment were in the increasing order of Hg<Cd<Ag<Mo<Sb<Sn<As<U<Sc<Co<Cs<Cu<Pb-< Ni < Cr < V < Zn < Rb < Mn < Ti < Fe and showed that the upper layer (top 10 cm) of lake sediment has been receiving a higher load of PTMs in the recent period. he observed EF values also suggested that major sources of PTMs in the sediment were from crustal origin except for a few metals (Ti, V, Sb, and Ag) which were enriched anthropogenically due to long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants, deposited at the higher elevations. Nevertheless, the level of pollution in sediments was low as indicated both by EF and geo-accumulation index.

Using a high quality dataset of 20 Danish lakes (1989-2008), we applied extended Local Similarity Analysis to construct temporal network of phytoplankton communities for each lake, obtained sub-network for each sampling month, and then measured indices of network complexity and stability for each sub-network. We assessed how lake re-oligotrophication, climate warming and grazers influenced the temporal dynamics on network complexity and stability of phytoplankton community covering three aspects: seasonal trends, long-term trends and detrended variability. We found strong seasonality for the complexity and stability of phytoplankton network, an increasing trend for the average degree, modularity, nestedness, persistence and robustness, and a decreasing trend for connectance, negative:positive interactions and vulnerability. Our study revealed a cascading effect of lake reoligotrophication, climate warming and zooplankton grazers on phytoplankton network stability through changes in network complexity characterizing diversity, interactions and topography. Network stability of phytoplankton increased with average degree, modularity, nestedness and decreased with connectance and negative:positive interactions. Oligotrophication and warming stabilized the phytoplankton network (enhanced robustness, persistence and decreased vulnerability) by enhancing its average degree, modularity, nestedness and by reducing its connectance, while zooplankton richness promoted stability of phytoplankton network through increases in average degree and decreases in negative interactions. Our results further indicate that the stabilization effects might lead to more closed, compartmentalized and nested interconnections especially in the deeper lakes, in the warmer seasons and during bloom periods. From a temporal dynamic network view, our findings highlight stabilization of the phytoplankton community as an adaptive response to lake reoligotrophication, climate warming and grazers.

Following the long-running interests of archaeology in explaining the origin and dispersal of new technologies, recent years have seen growing efforts to understand what drove the emergence and expansion of early hunter-gatherer pottery use across northern Eurasia. However, many regional di-mensions to this continental-scale phenomenon remain poorly understood. Initial pottery adoption has often been explained as a generic cultural response to warming climates and the growing diversity of food resources, yet resolving challenges of food security during seasonal shortfalls or general climatic downturns may have provided alternative motivations. It is also becoming clear that many regions experienced more complex patterns of pottery adoption and that many resist simplistic monocausal interpretations. In this paper we deploy a Human Ecodynamics framework to examine what drove the punctuated adoption of two early pottery traditions into Arctic Maritime Europe, which were separated by a multi-millennial ceramic hiatus -Early Northern Comb Ware (ENCW) and Asbestos Tempered Ware (ATW). Our multi-proxy approach involves the revision of pottery chronologies to clarify the timing and ecological context for each dispersal, combined with analysis of technological and functional dimensions of the ceramic traditions to understand the contrasting social organization of these technologies. Our results confirm that ENCW expanded at a time of increased locational investment and ecological abundance in the region, while ATW spread in a series of smaller and more intermittent waves in the context of a major ecological downturn and alongside a return to a high-mobility lifestyle. Finally, we use the concept of "source-sink dynamics" to suggest that both dispersals were driven by the same under-lying process. This involved major climatic fluctuations triggering small-scale population transfers from lake and riverine settings of western Russia, Finland and the Eastern Baltic region via interior areas and through to the Arctic Norwegian coastline, a persistent process that is also well-documented in later historical periods. Our results highlight the crucial importance of bridging-scale case studies as these have the "unsettling" potential to highlight deeper problems of equifinality. In this case, they reveal that two broadly similar material traditions spread into the same regions, albeit in the context of strikingly different environmental and behavioural conditions.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Ocnei Lake is one of the largest Transylvanian (Central Romania) neutral, hypersaline lake of man-made origin. We aimed to survey the seasonal dynamics of archaeal diversity in the water column of Ocnei Lake by employing microbiological methods as well as molecular techniques based on the sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that archaeal diversity in the water column increased with depth and salinity, with 8 OTUs being detected in the epilimnion compared to 21 found in the chemocline, and 32 OTUs in the monimolimnion. Down to 3.5 m depth, the archaeal community was markedly dominated by the presence of an unclassified archaeon sharing 93 % sequence identity to Halogeometricum spp. At the chemocline, the shift in archaeal community composition was associated with an increase in salinity, the main factor affecting the vertical distribution of archaeal assemblages. It appears that the microoxic and hypersaline monimolimnion is populated by several major haloarchaeal taxa, with minor fluctuations in their relative abundances throughout all seasons. The culturable diversity was reasonably correlated to the dominant OTUs obtained by molecular methods. Our results indicate that Ocnei Lake represents a relatively stable extreme habitat, accommodating a diverse and putatively novel archaeal community, as 30 % of OTUs could not be classified at the genus level.

Importance of Crayfish Prey to Nesting White Ibis (Eudocimus albus)	WATERBIRDS												Wading bird prey populations, prey availability and wading bird nesting success are all thought to be associated with hydrologic conditions in wetlands, but the relationship between successful nesting and essential prey types fed to chicks is poorly understood in many cases. Prey fed to White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) chicks were quantified and compared for three colonies in the northern Everglades within and between the 2008 and 2009 nesting seasons. Crayfish were the dominant prey type in both years, being present in 58-88% of chick boluses across all collections. Prey composition was not temporally variable within 2008, but chick diet shifted slightly toward more fish at the end of 2009 when the wetland was at its driest. Crayfish were the dominant (55-65%) energetic component of White Ibis chick diets in the northern Everglades during both a good nesting year (6,000 nests) with higher water levels (2008) and during an excellent nesting year (9,300 nests) when water levels were lower (2009). The results from this study and an earlier study suggest fish, along with terrestrial insects and urban refuse are only secondary prey for nesting White Ibis and that wetlands with abundant crayfish populations should promote high nesting effort.

Paul			Multiple factors regulate filtration by invasive mussels: Implications for whole-lake ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) is a filter-feeding invasive species that has re-engineered many freshwater ecosystems worldwide. High clearance rates (CRs) and dense populations underpin their ecological impacts. CRs, however, are highly variable, as are environmental factors that regulate them. Despite their widespread distribution in Europe and North America, knowledge of how multiple environmental factors regulate CRs of quagga mussels remains limited. We investigated quagga mussel CRs under varying conditions including water temperature, food availability, habitat depth, flow velocity, and duration of incubation in chambers with both static and flowing water. We found that CR was positively related to water temperature and initial food concentration in static chambers. When coupled with limited food concentration, coldwater (7.5 degrees C), due to a deep-water upwelling event, produced very low CR (similar to 10x lower) compared to warmer water (12-24 degrees C) (0.47 vs. 3.12-5.84 L g(-1) DW h(-1)). Mussels from deeper water (20 m) had CRs that were similar to 3.5x higher than from shallower depths (2-10 m) and CRs were inversely affected by total mussel dry weight. Flowrates from1 to 22 cms(-1) generated a unimodal pattern of CR with an optimal flow velocity of 6-12 cm s(-1) (similar to 2x higher than suboptimal CRs). Enhanced flow velocity (22 cm s(-1)), reflective of storm conditions in shallow waters, significantly increased the closing/reopening activity of mussel valves relative to lower velocities (1-12 cm s(-1)). Incubation time had a strong negative effect (similar to 2-4x reduction) on CRs likely reflecting refiltration in static chambers versus food saturation of mussels in flowing chambers, respectively. Our findings highlight how multiple factors can influence quagga mussel CRs by factors of 2-10. Givenwidespread habitat heterogeneity in large aquatic ecosystems, whole-lake estimates of mussel impacts should include multiple regulatory factors that affect mussel filtration.

This study assessed the nexus between small-scale fishing and fishers' livelihoods at Lake Itezhi-Tezhi, Zambia. Using the mixed-methods approach under a sustainable livelihood framework, findings revealed the fishing income was insufficient to improve their livelihood assets due to the low fish catches per fisher. Deficiency in fishing income was compounded by fishers' vulnerability to shocks caused mainly by the effects of the closed fishing season and crop/livestock production failures. As such, the study suggests, among other strategies, the support of fishery stakeholders towards alternative income sources and development of a livelihood-inclusive fisheries policy framework to help enhance the livelihoods of fishers at Lake Itezhi-Tezhi fishery. Beyond this lake fishery, this study contributes similar strategies as lessons for addressing the fishers' livelihood challenges and promoting sustainable fishing.

We assessed the diel vertical migrationDVM(UV/predation-avoidance strategy), numerical response, and starvation resistance (physiological strategies to cope with food scarcity) of the copepod Leptodiaptomus garciai and the rotifers Hexarthra jenkinae and Brachionus sp. Mexico, which constitute the zooplankton assemblage of Alchichica, a high-altitude, deep, oligotrophic, hyposaline, warm-monomictic lake located in Mexico. L. garciai followed the normal pattern of DVM in all seasons; with organisms concentrated approximate to 20 m deeper than the depth of 1% photosynthetically active radiation at mid-day, with evasion from the planktivore Poblana alchichica as the most probable driver. However, copepods could not evade the euphotic zone owing to the anoxic conditions of the hypolimnion during the well-established stratification period. Rotifers did not migrate vertically. The dominance of copepods throughout the year can be explained by their low food threshold, high proportion of usable reserves and the lowest rate of mass loss at food deprivation. Contrastingly, rotifers are scarce and intermittent due to frequent resource limitation and because they lose mass at higher rates. However, they are able to suddenly increase due to their high growth rates.

The collections were carried out between 2012 and 2016. The reproductive period, sex ratio, weight-length relationship and first sexual maturity were evaluated for seven species of commercial importance. The sex ratio showed that females are predominant for all species, except for Plagioscion squamossissimus. The weight-length relationship indicated a greater investment in weight for Cichla monoculus and Hassar affinis, and a greater investment in length for Hoplias malabaricus, Plagioscion squamosissimus, Prochilodus lacustris, Pygocentrus nattereri, and Schizodon dissimilis. The reproductive activity of the species was predominant in the rainy season, but C. monoculus, H. malabaricus and P. lacustris showed the ability to reproduce in both seasons. As management measures for the region, it is suggested a change in the closed fishing season established by IBAMA, from December 1 to April 30, to ensure the protection of all commercial species in this study.

SEASONAL VARIATION OF PLANKTONIC FUNGAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE XIJIANG RIVER, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To investigate the composition variation of planktonic fungal communities, and their relationship with water physical and chemical parameters in the Xijiang River in China, the compositions of planktonic fungal communities in the high-water and low-water period of the Xijiang River were studied in this paper by high-throughput sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicons. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Rozellomycota, and Zygomycota were detected from the planktonic fungal communities. However, most high-quality sequences (59.58 +/- 0.03%) could not accurately identify fungal phyla. Alpha-diversity indexes of the fungal communities and the relative abundances of Phoma brasiliensis, Pseudozyma sp., Psathyrella sp., Haematonectria haematococca, Podoscypha sp. in the high-water period were significantly higher than those in the low-water period, while the relative abundances of Basidiobolus sp., Rhizophydium littoreum, Teratosphaeria jonkershoekensis, Malassezia globosa, Malassezia resfricta, Malassezia sp., Alternaria eichhorniae, Knufia epidermidis, and Scedosporium prolificans were significantly lower. No significant correlation has been found between the fungal community distance and geographical distance along the river. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen significantly influenced the fungal community structure in the high-water period. These results provide information for us to understand the composition and influencing factors of the planktonic fungal community in rivers.					li, ziqi/JDC-9141-2023														1589-1623	1785-0037					2021	19	3					1925	1937		10.15666/aeer/1903_19251937	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1903_19251937													WOS:000656877100022

This information will help in management decisions in the Magdalena River basin regarding the future hydropower development. We identified which characteristics of the tributaries to the Magdalena River are important for determining potamodromous fish spawning grounds, and we estimated the percentage of future loss of spawning areas because of dam development. Ichthyoplankton density is directly related to the floodplain area, and inversely related with channel slope. Low channel slopes offer adult fish a longer distance for their upstream migration and a longer time for embryo development during their drift downstream from the spawning areas to nursery habitats (floodplain lakes). These features could increase the migration distance of the adults, the time for initial embryo development, and, because of its relationship with nursery habitats access, the offspring survival. The potential loss of the actual spawning grounds in the river network was estimated to be nearly 70% because of new dams. Our findings will help to reduce conflicts between hydropower and ecological interests.

Even though these mega-enterprises result in benefits to society, it also poses a threat to freshwater biodiversity. In Northeastern Brazil, for instance, the Sao Francisco River Integration Project already supplies water for millions of people, but over time it will also favor the introductions of multiple aquatic species in the river basins of the Northeastern Caatinga and Coastal Drainages ecoregion. These introductions can cause unprecedented impacts in the native ichthyofauna, such as homogenization of freshwater faunas, transmission of pathogens and loss of native species. This study compares the composition and relative frequency of fish species from Pocoes reservoir using data obtained by gillnetting and trawling before and after the Sao Francisco diversion in the dry and rainy seasons, and reports the first detection of Moenkhausia costae introduction in the Paraiba do Norte basin, through the Sao Francisco River channel. Our results show some evidences that M. costae may become dominant and invasive in Pocoes reservoir. The introduction of M. costae adds a new component of disruption for these freshwaters and may pose a serious threat to the endemic ichthyofauna in lentic and lotic systems from the Paraiba do Norte basin.					; Menezes, Rosemberg/V-1695-2017; de Lucena E.

Remote sensing, with the advantages of large-scale observations, has been widely applied to monitor turbidity change in lakes and rivers; however, few studies have focused on turbidity change of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007-2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.					; Ma, Yuanxu/L-1057-2013	Li, Yingkui/0000-0002-3722-8960; SHEN, MING/0000-0002-0566-7950; Tang, Maofeng/0000-0002-1596-3534; Ma, Yuanxu/0000-0003-0551-920X														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	2							182	10.3390/rs13020182	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13020182													WOS:000611555700001

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate b(bp)(lambda) in turbid inland water with complex optical properties. To accurately estimate the backscattering coefficients in inland water, a simple classification method based on the shape of remote sensing reflectance was first proposed to distinguish two water types (i.e., water type 1 and water type 2) with different backscattering characteristics. Then, trigonometric functions were developed to simulate the backscattering coefficients at all bands in water type 1 and the backscattering coefficients in the visible band of water type 2, whereas a linear function was built to estimate the backscattering coefficients in the near-infrared band of water type 2. The proposed algorithm was compared with four state-of-the-art methods and validated by an independently measured dataset of three lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 2020. The results showed that the proposed algorithm performed well in inland waters, with all mean absolute percentage errors < 40% and root-mean-square errors < 0.25 m(-1). Finally, the algorithm was applied to Ocean and Land Color Instrument images from 2016 to 2020 in Lake Taihu and Lake Hongze. It was found that the backscattering coefficients in Lake Taihu and Lake Hongze showed opposite seasonal variation trends, and the b(bp)(676) in Lake Hongze began to decrease since 2017, whereas no obvious interannual variation was observed in Taihu Lake in recent five years.					; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017	Xu, Jie/0000-0002-5249-6197; Xu, Jiafeng/0000-0002-5515-7342; Li, Yunmei/0000-0001-8116-942X													1939-1404	2151-1535					2021	14						8577	8593		10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3106262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3106262													WOS:000694698900006
J	Emir Akbulut, N; Tavsanoglu, ÜN				Emir Akbulut, Nuray; Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan			Impacts of environmental factors on zooplankton taxonomic diversity in coastal lagoons in Turkey	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Lagoons are valuable ecosystems providing various services, such as fishing, recreational activities, and land reclamation, as well as hosting high biodiversity. Although lagoons in Turkey cover a coastal area of more than 36,000 ha, few studies of them have been conducted. Therefore, two lagoons (Dalyan and Arapciftligi) located on the coast of the Sea of Marmara in the Kocacay Delta, which is under intense anthropogenic pressure, were investigated between November 2013 and March 2015 to examine the effects of environmental factors on taxonomic diversity. In addition, ongoing high nutrient flow from the Karacabey region triggers eutrophication in the lagoons, thus causing low water transparency. In both lagoons, the zooplankton assemblages were mainly dominated by cosmopolite and eurytopic taxa. Calanoid copepod Acartia clausi was the dominant species in both lagoons and showed seasonal variation, while no seasonality appeared in nauplii. The high abundance of rotifer species of the genera Keratella and Brachionus reflects the harsh conditions in the lagoons, caused by cultural eutrophication, dystrophy, and salinity increase and also by the temperature-enhanced decrease in zooplankton evenness and richness. Flushing rate, precipitation, high temperature, and salinity influence the species composition, which shifted to a greater dominance by hypoxia/salinity-tolerant zooplankters, resulting in lower species diversity in the lagoons.

Based on MODIS and Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images captured in 2005-2015 and a Combined Water Index (CWI), this paper extracted information on changes in the temporal and spatial characteristics and driving forces for lake areas in Xinjiang during past 11 years in different seasons (April, July and September). The results showed that over this time period, the area of the lakes exhibited an increasing trend. The largest surface area usually occurred in April, and the lowest value was measured in September. The lake shrinkage area in Xinjiang occurred mainly in Northern Xinjiang and the northeastern region of Southern Xinjiang, whereas the lake expansion area was concentrated in Eastern Xinjiang. Seasonal changes in Manas, Kanas, Barkol, Arkatag, Arik and Ebinur Lakes showed higher trends. Extracted the lake area based on the MODIS and TM/OLI image were analyzed, and both had a good corresponding relationship. The minimum R-2 was 0.548, and maximum RMSE was 44.1 km(2). Therefore, it was feasible to use MODIS to extract lake area. These changes in lake area resulted from both natural factors and human activities, and coupled effects greatly accelerated local environmental changes.

Additionally, mean concentration of lead (0.380mg kg(-1) in C. gibelio muscle) was higher compared to the maximum limit as set by Turkish Standards. Furthermore, in the assessment of the potential health risk, estimated weekly and daily intake of all metals were considerably below permissible tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) and permissible tolerable daily intake values.

J	Lyons, EA; Sheng, YW				Lyons, Evan A.; Sheng, Yongwei			LakeTime: Automated Seasonal Scene Selection for Global Lake Mapping Using Landsat ETM plus and OLI	REMOTE SENSING												The Landsat series of satellites provide a nearly continuous, high resolution data record of the Earth surface from the early 1970s through to the present. The public release of the entire Landsat archive, free of charge, along with modern computing capacity, has enabled Earth monitoring at the global scale with high spatial resolution. With the large data volume and seasonality varying across the globe, image selection is a particularly important challenge for regional and global multitemporal studies to remove the interference of seasonality from long term trends. This paper presents an automated method for selecting images for global scale lake mapping to minimize the influence of seasonality, while maintaining long term trends in lake surface area dynamics. Using historical meteorological data and a simple water balance model, we define the most stable period after the rainy season, when inflows equal outflows, independently for each Landsat tile and select images acquired during that ideal period for lake surface area mapping. The images selected using this method provide nearly complete global area coverage at decadal episodes for circa 2000 and circa 2014 from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors, respectively. This method is being used in regional and global lake dynamics mapping projects, and is potentially applicable to any regional/global scale remote sensing application.					; Sheng, Yongwei/HNP-7933-2023	Sheng, Yongwei/0000-0003-4447-944X; 														2072-4292				JAN	2018	10	1							54	10.3390/rs10010054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10010054													WOS:000424092300053

Proposed power transmission lines in Cambodia constitute a significant new threat to the largest population of the Critically Endangered Bengal florican Houbaropsis bengalensis	ORYX												The remaining Indochina population of the Critically Endangered Bengal florican Houbaropsis bengalensis breeds in the floodplain of Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. The population has declined substantially but survival rates have not been published previously. Survival could potentially be reduced by the planned construction of high-tension power transmission lines that may begin in 2016. Using data from 17 individuals monitored by satellite transmitters over. years we estimated the annual adult survival rate to be 89.9% (95% CI 82.2-97.6%), which is comparable to that of other bustards. Interrogation of movement paths revealed that for the.. individuals for which we had sufficient data for non-breeding seasons, all annual migration routes between breeding and non-breeding areas crossed the proposed route of the transmission line. The route also impinged on the margins of one important and one minor breeding concentration. A review of bustard collision rates confirmed the vulnerability of bustards to power lines, and the proposed development therefore presents an additional threat to the future of this species in Indochina.					; Dolman, Paul/AAK-3914-2020; Silva, João/L-6745-2013	Dolman, Paul/0000-0002-9340-2791; 													0030-6053	1365-3008				JAN	2018	52	1					147	155		10.1017/S0030605316000739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605316000739													WOS:000424137700020

We studied the effect of a large shallow lake on the POM pool of the water passing through it. Over four years, we analysed monthly the amount and composition of POM and a set of environmental variables in the inflows and in the outflow of Lake Vortsjarv (Estonia). In the inflows, the live pool of POM consisted of phytoplankton - small crypto-, dino-, and chlorophytes. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, was positively correlated with temperature and total phosphorus and negatively with dissolved silica, total nitrogen, and discharge. In the outflow, the share of the live component of POM was much larger than in the inflows but was also dominated by phytoplankton represented by grazing resistant filamentous cyanobacteria. Chl a was positively correlated with total phosphorus, temperature, pH, and precipitation, and negatively with dissolved silica, total nitrogen, and discharge in the outflow. The different amounts, composition, and seasonal dynamics of POM in the inflows and in the outflow have potentially substantial impacts on the food web with a predominating classical pathway in the inflows versus a detrital pathway in the outflow.

USE OF THE EPIPHYTIC DIATOMS TO ESTIMATE THE ECOLOGICAL STATUS OF LAKE MOGAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study, the seasonal succession of the diatoms on Phragmites australis community was investigated in Lake Mogan (Turkey), and the epiphytic diatom community was used to estimate the ecological condition of the lake. Five stations were chosen in the littoral region of the lake, and diatom samples were taken from the P. australis monthly between January and November 2013. Two stations were selected in the pelagial region and chlorophyll a concentrations were determined. Lake water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity and Secchi depths were measured, and total nitrogen, total phosphorus and silicate were analyzed. A total of 61 epiphytic diatom species were identified in Lake Mogan. The dominant species were those with tolerance to alpha-beta mesosaprobic conditions. According to the mean Secchi depth, chlorophyll and total phosphorus concentrations, the lake was eutrophic. The IDG, IPS, DESCY, WAT, IDP and TDI indices, calculated according to epiphytic diatoms, indicated an ecological quality between medium and poor (classes III-IV). Among them, IDG and IPS are recommended for monitoring of ecological status in the lake because these indices also integrated all diatom taxa within the samples. The occurrence of pollution-tolerant species and the fact that most indices showed an ecological quality of medium or poor indicated an increase of organic matter and eutrophication in Lake Mogan.

Orbital-climate control of mass-flow sedimentation in a Miocene alluvial-fan succession (Teruel Basin, Spain)	GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY OF ALLUVIAL AND FLUVIAL FANS: TERRESTRIAL AND PLANETARY PERSPECTIVES	Geological Society Special Publication											The role of climate change in driving alluvial-fan sedimentation is hard to assess in pre-Quaternary successions, for which detailed chronologies and climate-proxy records cannot be easily established. In the Teruel Basin (Spain), high-resolution (10(4)-10(5) years) chronological and palaeoclimatic information was derived by orbital tuning of Late Miocene mudflat to ephemeral-lake deposits. The semi-arid palaeoclimate made this low-gradient, basinal environment sensitive to thresholds in the local hydrological balance. Basic facies rhythms are attributed to alternating, relatively humid/arid phases controlled by the climatic precession cycle. The lower stratigraphic interval of this reference section interfingers with distal, coarse-clastic beds from a coeval alluvial fan. The consistent interdigitation of debris-flow deposits with distal strata indicative of arid-to-humid climate transitions shows that fan sedimentation was regulated by climate cyclicity. In particular, the largest volumes of terrigenous debris were shed from the fan onto adjacent mudflats during transitions to relatively humid periods with pronounced seasonality, during precession minima. Distal to medial sections within alluvial-fan outcrops also feature prominent, laterally continuous alternations of coarse-and fine-clastic packages. This high degree of architectural organization, uncommon in fan successions, and stratigraphic relationships with the reference section suggest orbitally controlled climate change to have been the forcing mechanism.

This article studied the water quality characteristics of seven inflowing rivers emptying into Lake Tanganyika. Chemical analyses were carried out during rainy and dry seasons. The nutrients and suspended solids at some sites were above the critical level for healthy river water. Contamination was concentrated mainly around urban areas which have been newly developed to accommodate the rapidly growing population in the country. Compared to previous studies, the concentrations of nutrients in the river water were relatively high, indicating increasing pollution in Bujumbura's rivers. The mean values of physico-chemical parameters, with the exception of suspended solids, were found to be higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. This result is consistent with previous studies. Principal components analysis and factor analysis were employed for numerical analyses, and proven to be useful to assess the source of pollution in specific river sites, where monitoring data is missing. Routine monitoring of basic physical and chemical indicators of water quality is recommended for all urban lakes and rivers in order to protect both the aquatic ecosystem and health of the local residents living near the lake.

The present study investigated seasonal variations in concentrations of mcy A and 16S rRNA genes, encoded in the genus Microcystis using real-time PCR, and measured the water quality variables and microcystin concentrations in a hypereutrophic fish pond between June and November 2007. Prior to field survey, the relationship between axenic Microcystis aeruginosa NIES 102 cell abundance and concentrations of mcy A and 16S rRNA genes was determined by real-time PCR in the laboratory. Based on the quantitative relationship, microcystin-producing and total Microcystis cell numbers in the study site were estimated. The average dominance ratio of microcystin-producing strains in the total Microcystis population was approximately 80% and microcystin concentration was highly associated with toxic Microcystis cell numbers equivalent of mcy A gene. It was also observed that total nitrogen concentration was associated with development of Microcystis blooms, and high concentrations of NO, and NH4 increased microcystin production by promoting growth of microcystin-producing Microcystis strains.

The record encompasses a Late Pleistocene and Late Holocene interval, interrupted by a hiatus. We analyzed (1) opal phytoliths and diatoms to infer the regional environment, climate, and changes in lake trophic state, and (2) total carbon and nitrogen (TC and TN) and stable isotope data (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to infer organic matter sources and composition. Findings indicate that, in Late Pleistocene times, a cool, semi-arid or highly seasonal climate existed, with a dominance of C3 grasslands and riparian hydrophilous shrublands while the shallow freshwater environment was characterized by benthic diatoms and littoral macrophytes. Late Holocene times were initially characterized by a temperate and humid or sub-humid climate, and dominance of grasslands and bunch grasses, while Laguna Formosa was dominated by phytoplankton. The abundance and diversity of littoral hydrophilic vegetation, and riparian forest vegetation, increased progressively over time, as a result of increased rainfall, from ca. 1800 cal yr BP and the onset of a subtropical (temperate and humid) climate by ca. 1300 cal yr BP. Such inferences are in close agreement with an earlier palynological study of Laguna Formosa, and support the paleoclimatic models for the Late Pleistocene and Late Holocene of southeastern South America.					; Perez, Laura/KHC-6172-2024; Bergamino, Leandro/N-8210-2017	Bergamino, Leandro/0000-0003-1572-4370; Garcia-Rodriguez, Felipe/0000-0003-1061-7437; del Puerto, Laura/0000-0003-2003-9263													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 1	2020	543								109586	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109586													WOS:000518707600003

Land-cover changes and influences on playa wetland inundation on the Southern High Plains	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Playas are ephemeral, depressional wetlands that are the primary form of surface water in the Southern High Plains of North America, an area that has experienced extensive and relatively recent land-cover changes. Because the influences of these changes in landscape structure (composition, configuration, and connectivity of land-cover types) on playas have not been assessed over time, we used remotely sensed imagery to quantify changes in the five regionally dominant land-cover categories (cropland, rangeland/grassland, fallow, developed, and water) and playa inundation patterns in Texas on six dates during the late growing season over a 23-year span (1986-2008). A decrease in the number of wet playas was observed over that time, associated with significant differences among land covers between and within years around dry vs. wet playas (with playas surrounded by rangeland/grassland being twice as likely to be dry than playas surrounded by cropland). Mean patch size and overall area of rangeland/grassland increased over time, possibly due in part to conservation efforts in the area. Because playas are crucial habitats, these landscape changes have likely affected regional biodiversity; our findings indicate that assessments of the remaining playa wetlands should be undertaken to compare biotic communities with surrounding land-cover history.

Linking Hydrology, Ecosystem Function, and Livelihood Outcomes in African Papyrus Wetlands Using a Bayesian Network Model	WETLANDS												Relationships between hydrology, ecosystem function and livelihood outcomes in Nyando papyrus wetland in western Kenya were integrated in a Bayesian Network model with 34 nodes which was populated with results of ecohydrological and socio-economic research and stakeholder consultations. Scenarios for dry and wet seasons were evaluated. For a current "average" year in Nyando wetland the probabilities of "Ecosystem function" and "Livelihoods outcomes" being "good" were 62 and 19 %, respectively. Under dry conditions, these values changed to 33 and 37 %; and under wet conditions to 85 and 6 %, respectively, indicating that wet conditions had a positive effect on the ecosystem but a negative effect on livelihoods. Ecosystem function and livelihood outcomes were most sensitive to flooding, conversion to agriculture, livestock grazing, and papyrus harvest. Flooded conditions limit cropping, livestock herding and vegetation harvesting but have a positive effect on ecosystem function. The advantage of this interdisciplinary and participatory modeling approach is that it allows incorporation of formal and informal knowledge, allows evaluation of policy scenarios and trade-offs between ecosystem services, and recognizes uncertainty in system outcomes. Further work will incorporate the impact of management policies and institutions on resource use. This approach will be useful in decision support for wise use of wetlands.					; KIPKEMBOI, JULIUS/ABF-1956-2021; Gettel, Gretchen/M-8983-2013; van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013; Rahman, Mohammad Mahfuzur/HKO-8474-2023	Rahman, Mohammad Mahfuzur/0000-0002-4670-2804; Gettel, Gretchen/0000-0002-9288-1583; 													0277-5212					JUN	2013	33	3					381	397		10.1007/s13157-013-0395-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-013-0395-z													WOS:000318797900001

However, methods for detecting changes in short-term drought risk currently remain inadequate. We proposed a statistical method to quantify the risk of only short-term droughts by combining frequency analysis and Fourier transformation with phase-randomization. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using the long-term data (1949-2018) of the largest river basin in China, i.e., Yangtze River Basin (YRB) where drought risk is high and short-term drought risks have rarely been evaluated. The mean short-term drought risk was 71.7 +/- 11.9 % (mean +/- one standard deviation). Regarding the temporal trend, short-term drought risk for 65.4 % of grids increased over time (0.23 +/- 0.15 %<middle dot>yr ), of which 90.0 % were statistically significant ( < 0.05). Such spatiotemporal variability is possibly resulted from the joint influence of the Western Pacific Subtropical High, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. This study proposed a new method to quantify the risk of short-term droughts that enable us to better manage short-term droughts. Our finding can help regional governments give more attention to short-term droughts and promote the rational allocation of regional drought preparedness resources in the YRB.

Fifteen physical and chemical variables were recorded, and their relationship with the density of 162 phytoplankton species was established using Canonical Correspondence Analysis, which showed that the density of phytoplankton was higher when minerals and nutrients increased. An anthropogenic impact was also most evident in structuring phytoplankton assemblages at sites close to the lake where agriculture was concentrated. The results obtained from the Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Equitability diversity indices indicated mediocre water quality. Determinations of the trophic state were made by examining several diverse criteria, such as transparency and the concentrations of chlorophyll a and phosphorus. Our study area was characterized as mesotrophic according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development classification.

In the light of rising anthropogenic salinization of temperate freshwater lakes, it is highly relevant to understand how saline emissions, as well as the rehabilitation from salt pollution might affect lake circulation patterns. In this study, we present the impact of industrial pollution with chloride salts on the deep Alpine lake Traunsee in Austria from 1930 to 2005 and the observed limnological changes during the recovery from salinization in the following 12years. We assembled and analysed a unique dataset of monthly sampling profiles covering chloride, conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen over a 87-year period. We quantified the impact of saline emissions on the lake's total chloride content, water densities, stability indices and deepwater oxygen concentrations. Time-series of water density profiles and stability indices revealed a significant impact of salinization on seasonal stratification and mixing. Higher dilution and shallower release of saline wastes and the short water retention in Traunsee helped to prevent a long-lasting density stratification. Nevertheless, two periods of salt-induced meromixis occurred in the lake. The first was caused directly by the disposal of saline wastes into the deepwater in the 1930s and 1940s, whereas the second was induced by the recovery from salinization in recent years. The naturally faster wash-out of salts from shallower water layers reinforced the density gradient and impeded vertical water circulation after salt pollution ceased. The rehabilitation from salinization had a stronger effect on stratification intensity and deepwater oxygen concentration than the continuous salt pollution over the last century.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2019	81	1							7	10.1007/s00027-018-0602-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-018-0602-3													WOS:000451752300001

The lacustrine habitat with the most stable hydrologic regime had the highest zooplankton biomass coinciding with the highest phytoplankton biomass. The riverine habitat with the lowest Secchi depth overall hadthe largest zooplankton body size, but high zooplankton biomass only in high water level years. The seasonally inundated floodplain habitats had the lowest zooplankton biomass and the smallest individual body size, coinciding with the lowest phytoplankton biomass and the highest predation pressure, the latter indicated by a low zooplankton: phytoplankton biomass ratio (ZB:PB). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that pelagic zooplankton assemblages were primarily influenced by phytoplankton biomass in lacustrine habitat, by advection and turbidity in riverine regions, and by predation pressure in seasonally inundated floodplain region. We conclude that the importance of bottom-up and top-down effects on zooplankton biomass and body size varied with habitat type in Lake Poyang.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; liu, jinfu/MIN-3970-2025; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2019	26	3					2270	2280		10.1007/s11356-018-3658-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3658-7								30465241					WOS:000456198400018

In situ datasets obtained from 30 water sampling sites show a strong correlation (R-2=0.73) with the reflectance ratio of two Landsat 8 (L8) bands, the green band (band 3: B3) versus the red band (band 4: B4), B3/B4, by an exponential equation. The algorithm for estimating Chla using this ratio was well-matched up the validation using multiple-dates in-situ datasets (R-2 = 0.82; RMSE 5 %) and was then applied to L8 images level 2 acquired in both dry and rainy seasons to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of Chla over the reservoir. Obtained maps of Chla present clearly two trends: (1) Chla in the reservoir water in the dry season (averaged at 15.3 mg/m(3)) is relatively lower than those in the rainy season (averaged at 17.0 mg/m(3)); (2) In both seasons, Chla increased from water area in front of the Chay River mouth to the center of the reservoir. The algorithm and method outlined in this study could be applied to monitoring CM in other inland waters having similar features as the Thac Ba Reservoir water.

Seasonal and Spatial Variation of Dissolved Oxygen and Nutrients in Padaviya Reservoir, Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and aquifers are important freshwater sources for basic human needs such as drinking, sanitation, and agriculture. The anthropogenic influences on the natural environment, especially on freshwater resources, have increased dramatically during the last few decades. Eutrophication and pollution are major threats to many of these water bodies. There are thousands of man-made reservoirs, which are centuries old in Sri Lanka, and only a handful of them have been extensively studied and monitored. This study investigates the spatial and seasonal variations of water quality in Padaviya Reservoir by studying the vertical distribution of physical parameters and inorganic nitrogen species: ammonia, nitrite and nitrate, reactive phosphate, and dissolved oxygen. Padaviya Reservoir, which is an ancient man-made irrigation reservoir, has never been studied in detail to assess its water quality. Sharp chemical gradients for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, reactive phosphate, and dissolved oxygen were observed between surface and bottom waters of the reservoir, suggesting that it does not overturn completely. The temperature difference is between the surface and bottom waters of about 2 degrees C, which is not large enough to cause thermal stratification. The most probable reason for the stratification is extensive photosynthesis at surface waters with subsequent decomposition of the organic material at the bottom.

Land cover/land use was classified by using a recursive partitioning and regression tree with MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, which were reconstructed based on the Savitzky-Golay filtering approach. The MODIS product Quality Assessment Science Data Sets (QA-SDS) was analyzed and all scenes with valid data covering more than 75% of the Sanjiang Plain were selected for the SEBAL modeling. This provided 12 overpasses during 184-day growing season from May 1st to October 31st, 2006. Daily ET estimated by the SEBAL model was misestimaed at the range of -11.29% to 27.57% compared with that measured by Eddy Covariance system (10.52% on average). The validation results show that seasonal ET from the SEBAL model is comparable to that from ground observation within 8.86% of deviation. Our results reveal that the time series daily ET of different land cover/use increases from vegetation on-going until June or July and then decreases as vegetation senesced. Seasonal ET is lower in dry farmland (average (Ave): 491 mm) and paddy field (Ave: 522 mm) and increases in wetlands to more than 586 mm. As expected, higher seasonal ET values are observed for the Xingkai Lake in the southeastern part of the Sanjiang Plain (Ave: 823 mm), broadleaf forest (Ave: 666 mm) and mixed wood (Ave: 622 mm) in the southern/western Sanjiang Plain. The ET estimation with SEBAL using MODIS products can provide decision support for operational water management issues.

Pollen, vegetation change and climate at Lake Barombi Mbo (Cameroon) during the last ca. 33 000 cal yr BP: a numerical approach	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												This paper presents quantitative reconstructions of vegetation and climate along the pollen sequence of Lake Barombi Mbo, southwestern Cameroon (4 degrees 39'45.75 '' N, 9 degrees 23'51.63 '' E, 303ma.s.l.) during the last 33 000 cal yr BP, improving previous empirical interpretations. The biomisation method was applied to reconstruct potential biomes and forest successional stages. Mean annual precipitation, mean annual potential evapotranspiration and an index of moisture availability were reconstructed using modern analogues and an artificial neural network technique. The results show a dense forested environment around Lake Barombi Mbo of mixed evergreen/semi-deciduous type during the most humid phases (highest precipitation and lowest evapotranspiration), but with a more pronounced semi-deciduous type from ca. 6500 cal yr BP to the present day, related to increased seasonality. This forest displays a mature character until ca. 2800 cal yr BP, then becomes of secondary type during the last millennium, probably due to increased human activity. Two episodes of forest fragmentation are shown, which are synchronous with the lowest reconstructed precipitation and highest potential evapotranspiration values. The first of these occurs during the LGM, and the second one from ca. 3000 to ca. 1200 cal yr BP, mainly linked to high precipitation seasonality. Savanna were, however, never extensive within the Barombi Mbo basin, existing instead inside the forest in form of savanna patches. The climate reconstructions at Lake Barombi Mbo suggest that the artificial neural networks technique would be more reliable in this region, although the annual precipitation values are likely under-estimated through the whole sequence.																			1814-9324	1814-9332					2012	8	1					59	78		10.5194/cp-8-59-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-8-59-2012													WOS:000300878100005

More than that, pinnoite-bearing sediments, occurring in this lake, are rare in the world. However, little attention has been paid to the hydro-climate change and brine evolution correlation with the formation of pinnoite deposit. According to the multi-proxy records, as well as AMS C-14 dating, the sediment profiles DCD02 and DCD03 from Da Qaidam Salt Lake were studied. The results revealed that the ore-forming age of three pinnoite deposits are 7.83-8.62calka BP, 6.74-7.07calka BP and 4.66-5.41calka BP. The sedimentary evolution of Da Qaidam Salt Lake along with the pinnoite formation during the past 13,000years can be divided into four stages, i.e., (1) relatively fresh and deep paleo-lake with low salinity during 12.98-9.00calka BP; (2) seasonal variations between fresh and brackish paleo-lake during 9.00-8.62calka BP; (3) salt lake stage with relatively high salinity and alkalinity during 8.62-4.66calka BP, and (4) relatively shallow lake with high salinity since 4.66calka BP. Under favorable sedimentologic and hydrogeochemical conditions, a series of boron deposits including pinnoite ore formed in different zones of Da Qaidam Salt Lake due to the different ore-forming mechanisms. Finally, under the differential effect of climate warming condition between the high mountain catchments and arid basin, the boron ore-forming model was established as a higher mountain-lower basin-shallower water model.

Here we employed a comprehensive atmospheric transport model combined with multiple environmental compartment exchange modules and a marine food web model to simulate levels and risks of SCCPs in the marine environment and fish in the Yellow Sea (YS), East China Sea (ECS), and South China Sea (SCS). Results unveiled a decreasing SCCP level in seawaters and sediments towards offshore. The modeled SCCP total (dry + wet) loadings to the three seawater bodies ranged from 0.0013 to 0.1635 mg/m(2)/season and gaseous diffusive deposition ranged from 43 to 4443 kg/month. The meteorological factors and secondary emission contributing to seasonal changes in SCCPs were also discussed. A tagging technique was used to trace origins of SCCPs, demonstrating that source proximity contributes most in SCCP contamination to these seawater bodies. Modeled SCCP levels in 5 marine fish in the YS, ECS, and SCS ranged from 23 to 111 ng/g. Our results showed the current SCCP levels in the marine environment and fish did not pose exposure risks to fish consumers for different age groups and genders. However, if consumed fish were harvested and imported from more seriously contaminated seawaters by SCCPs, the estimated dietary intake (EDI) would considerably increase. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Water chemistry and physical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, light, water color - Pt color -, turbidity, phosphorous and nitrogen forms, silica, alkalinity, chloride, sulfate content, chemical oxygen demand) were measured both in the field and laboratory and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. It was possible to distinguish the pans on the basis of water color, separating them into two groups: G1, consisting of colored pans characterized by low turbidity and high Pt color, and G2, consisting of turbid pans characterized by high turbidity and low Pt color. Both groups displayed temporal (seasonal, as well as annual) trends, and their hydrological cycles followed regular cyclical patterns. Three hydrological phases (filling, drying, and desiccated) were described in the case of the colored pans, and five for the turbid (filling, diluted, drying, concentrated, desiccated).

In terms of time, the probability distribution of climatic phenomenon occurrence time was used to divide the flood season into plum rain and the typhoon periods. In terms of space, the Taihu Basin was divided into different sub-regions by the Copula functions. Finally, we constructed a flood risk management model using the Copula-based Bayesian network to analyze the flood risk. The results showed the plum rain period occurs from June 24 to July 21 and the typhoon period from July 22 to September 22. Considering the joint distribution of sub-region precipitation and the water level of Taihu Lake, we divided the Taihu Basin into three sub-regions (P-I, P-II, and P-III) for risk analysis in the plum rain period. However, the Taihu Basin was used as a whole for flood risk analysis in the typhoon period. Risk analysis indicated a probability of 2.4%, and 0.8%, respectively, for future adverse drainage during the plum rain period and the typhoon period, the flood risk increases rapidly with the rising water level in the Taihu Lake.																				2073-4441				AUG	2019	11	8							1534	10.3390/w11081534	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11081534													WOS:000484561500009

Magnitudes and Drivers of Greenhouse Gas Fluxes in Floodplain Ponds During Drawdown and Inundation by the Three Gorges Reservoir	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Hydropower reservoirs are well-known emitters of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This is due in part to seasonal water level fluctuations that transfer terrestrial C and N from floodplains to reservoirs. Partial pressures and fluxes of the greenhouse gases CH4, CO2, and N2O are also a function of in situ biological C and N cycling and overall ecosystem metabolism, which varies on a diel basis within inland waters. Thus, greenhouse gas emissions in hydropower reservoirs likely vary over seasonal and diel time scales with local hydrology and ecosystem metabolism. China's Three Gorges Reservoir is among the largest and newest in the world, with a floodplain that encompasses approximately one third of the reservoir area. We measured diel partial pressures and fluxes of greenhouse gases in ponds on the Three Gorges Floodplain. We repeated these measurements on the submerged floodplain following inundation by the Three Gorges Reservoir. During reservoir drawdown, CH4 ebullition comprised 60-68% of emissions from floodplain ponds to the atmosphere. Using linear mixed effects modeling, we show that partial pressures of CH4 and CO2 and diffusive CO2 fluxes in floodplain ponds varied on a diel basis with in situ respiration. Floodplain inundation by the Three Gorges Reservoir significantly moderated areal CH4 diffusion and ebullition. Diel pCO(2), pCH(4), pN(2)O, and diffusive fluxes of CO2 on the submerged floodplain were also driven by in situ respiration. The drawdown/inundation cycle of the Three Gorges Reservoir therefore changes the magnitudes of aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes on its floodplain. Plain Language Summary Considered to be clean sources of energy, reservoirs emit greenhouse gases like other inland waters. Reservoir water levels fluctuate seasonally, introducing terrestrial organic matter to dammed rivers. Greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are produced daily when organic matter is respired by aquatic microbes. This is balanced by consumption of carbon dioxide during daytime photosynthesis. We measured concentrations and fluxes of methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide over 24 hr in ponds on the Three Gorges Floodplain. We repeated these measurements in the overlaying Three Gorges Reservoir following its inundation of the floodplain. Among the different flux pathways, methane bubbles comprised the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions from floodplain ponds. Daily methane and carbon dioxide concentrations and carbon dioxide fluxes in these floodplain ponds varied with microbial respiration. By contrast, methane fluxes were much lower per unit area following floodplain inundation by the Three Gorges Reservoir. Daily concentrations of these gases and carbon dioxide fluxes were also driven by microbial respiration on the submerged floodplain. Seasonal water level fluctuations in the Three Gorges Reservoir therefore change how greenhouse gases move to the atmosphere on its floodplain.					; He, Yixin/MGV-0018-2025; Chen, Huai/AAI-1024-2020; Chen, Huai/A-7418-2015; Holtgrieve, Gordon/C-5371-2009	Miller, Benjamin/0000-0001-8579-9621; He, Yixin/0000-0001-5419-2501; Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X; Holtgrieve, Gordon/0000-0002-4451-3567													2169-8953	2169-8961				AUG	2019	124	8					2499	2517		10.1029/2018JG004701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004701													WOS:000497955300006

Here we show, using spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) JERS-1 measurements, the first spatially dense hydraulic mapping of the passage of a flood wave through a large, topographically complex floodplain. We find that temporal changes in flood water heights(partial derivative h/partial derivative t) are more complex than typically assumed. During the passage of a flood wave, sharp variations in partial derivative h/partial derivative t are localized along some floodplain channels. These channels separate adjacent locations with different rates of infilling. Near the peak of the flood wave, some of the channels are no longer evident as controls on partial derivative h/partial derivative t. During the passage of the flood wave, flow paths change from bathymetrically influenced to hydraulically controlled ( and back again), thus it is difficult to know the flow path a-priori from bathymetry alone.

Turbulent heat fluxes are assessed using both eddy covariance and aerodynamic methods with a relative accuracy estimated at 15%. At time scales ranging from the diurnal to the seasonal cycle, heat exchanges appear to be dominated by evaporation, and most of the heat release of the lagoon occurs on time scales between 2 and 20 days. Seasonal variations are mainly due to the effects of net radiation and air temperature, while daily and short-term fluctuations of the sensible heat flux are influenced by air temperature and wind. In the short term, low relative humidity is more efficient than high wind speeds to produce strong peaks of evaporation (latent heat flux more than 350 W m(-2)). Episodes of Tramontane, a regional orography-induced wind, are shown to be responsible for 84% of the cooling of the lagoon surface (for cooling of more than 0.5 degrees C) and for 70% of the heat loss due to evaporation. Short-term heat transfers between the lagoon and the atmosphere are largely punctuated by the two regional winds. The Tramontane generates pulses of evaporation lasting 1 to 4 days, while Marin episodes result in very low or negative latent heat fluxes and negative sensible heat fluxes corresponding to heat transfer from the atmosphere to the lagoon.

However, the causes have remained unclear. Here, we investigate the changes in flood frequency in Switzerland based on long time series of discharge and lake levels, precipitation, and weather types and based on climate model simulations, focusing on the warm season. Annual series of peak discharge or maximum lake level, in agreement with previous studies, display increased frequency of floods in the mid-19th century and decreased frequency after the Second World War. Annual series of warm-season mean precipitation and high percentiles of 3 d precipitation totals (partly) reflect these changes. A daily weather type classification since 1763 is used to construct flood probability indices for the catchments of the Rhine in Basel and the outflow of Lake Lugano, Ponte Tresa. The indices indicate an increased frequency of flood-prone weather types in the mid-19th century and a decreased frequency in the post-war period, consistent with a climate reconstruction that shows increased (decreased) cyclonic flow over western Europe in the former (latter) period. To assess the driving factors of the detected circulation changes, we analyze weather types and precipitation in a large ensemble of atmospheric model simulations driven with observed sea-surface temperatures. In the simulations, we do not find an increase in flood-prone weather types in the Rhine catchment in the 19th century but a decrease in the post-war period that could have been related to sea-surface temperature anomalies.

Highly dynamic systems such as reservoirs are convenient environments to investigate the effects of environmental variables on phytoplankton morphology. However, to fully understand the effects of mixing and trophic state on phytoplankton functional group (FG) distribution, the entire water column must be considered since integrated or sub-superficially collected samples, may not adequately represent phytoplankton structure. This idea was tested by analyzing vertical profiles of phytoplankton FGs, their relative biomass, physical and chemical parameters, through monthly samplings over a 2 years period, at three stations located along the longitudinal axis in the monomictic, mesotrophic I. kizcetepeler reservoir, northwestern part of Turkey. Thermal stratification occurred in the reservoir from April to September, and zmix/zeu values increased after the breaking down of the thermocline. Nine FGs characterized the seasonal cycle and C-strategist organisms were typical representatives of the assemblages. Nutrient availability and temperature were found to influence phytoplankton dynamics, whereas water withdrawal played a secondary role. Groups Y, P, B, J, F, Lo and Tc showed heterogeneous distribution along the water column and, temperature heterogeneity, high DIN values in surface waters, zmix/zeu values and sedimentation loss were the most important factors regulating their distribution. The results show that phytoplankton morphological spectrum throughout the entire water column, contributes useful information to assess the influence of mixing and trophic state on phytoplankton dynamics in mesotrophic reservoirs.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008; ONGUN SEVİNDİK, Tuğba/JAN-7028-2023; ÇELİK, KEMAL/I-5815-2017	ONGUN SEVINDIK, Tugba/0000-0001-7682-0142; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862; 													0003-4088	2100-000X				FEB 22	2017	53									10.1051/limn/2016040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2016040													WOS:000412937600001
J	Gyllström, M; Hansson, LA				Gyllström, M; Hansson, LA			Dormancy in freshwater zooplankton: Induction, termination and the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling	AQUATIC SCIENCES												For a short-lived organism, such as a freshwater zooplankter, the ways of coping with years of local recruitment failure are either to disperse between habitats and recolonise or to disperse in time through diapause. Diapause is common among freshwater zooplankton and is generally seen as a way to escape periods of harsh environmental conditions. The egg-bank or pool of diapausing copepodites in lake sediments resulting from the production of diapausing stages has several implications for zooplankton ecology, genetics, and evolution which we outline in this review. The presence of a benthic dormant stage also creates a coupling between the benthic habitat and the pelagic, and we argue that zooplankton phenology is a result of selective forces in both habitats. The spatial distribution of diapausing eggs appears to be governed by random resuspension dynamics coupled with higher hatching rates in shallow waters. For diapausing copepodites, however, an active choice of where and how deep to enter the sediment may affect their distribution. In a reanalysis of published data, we found a size-dependent bathymetric distribution and vertical distribution in the sediment of diapausing cyclopoid copepodites. Our review of published laboratory studies showed that predictors of seasonal change such as photoperiod and temperature were the only type of cues used for the termination of diapause. We also found a relation between generation length and the type of cue used for diapause induction: copepods mainly used seasonal cues from the abiota, rotifers mainly used cues from the biotic environment, and cladocerans used a mix of both types. We describe patterns in emergence timing and contribution to population dynamics from studies using in situ estimation of emergence, and conclude that hatching from dormant stages may qualitatively and quantitatively affect zooplankton population dynamics and seasonal succession.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				AUG	2004	66	3					274	295		10.1007/s00027-004-0712-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-004-0712-y													WOS:000223353000004

(1) We compared benthic and pelagic habitats based on their algal biomass and community composition and assessed the dietary quality in terms of fatty acid (FA) concentrations in both habitats. The algal community compositions differed significantly between habitats. Both benthic and pelagic habitats contained saturated and unsaturated FAs, but on average there were more FAs relative to carbon in the pelagic habitat (44 +/- 29 mu g mg C-1) than the benthic habitat (23 +/- 18 mu g mg C-1) across all studied ponds. (2) We quantified the contribution of benthic mats to the whole-lake FA pool and found that benthic mats dominate (on average > 90%) the basal FA resource within tundra ponds. (3) Using a series of feeding experiments, we found that Daphnia survival and FA concentrations increased when a benthic mat slurry supplemented low concentrations of phytoplankton. However, Daphnia could not survive solely on benthic mats, and nor did benthic mats increase adult Daphnia survival when mats were offered as coherent pieces. The extent to which pelagic consumers could be supported by benthic production challenges the view that benthic habitats are functionally separate from the pelagic food webs within northern lake ecosystems.

Field-based data are needed to improve regional estimates of C storage and land-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from dryland environments where pans are prevalent. This paper provides a first estimate of C stores and CO2 efflux within the salt pan, grassland and woodland of Ntwetwe Pan in the Makgadikgadi Basin, Botswana. C fluxes and stores associated with cyanobacteria-salt crusts are also determined. Total C stores are approximately an order of magnitude greater than on neighbouring Kalahari Sands at 675 +/- 41, 760 +/- 94 and 274 +/- 15 tons ha(-1) to 1 m depth in the woodland, grassland and salt pan respectively. Most of the C is found as carbonate, with organic C comprising 4.6-10% of total C. CO2 efflux increased with temperature and also increased for a few hours after flooding of the pan surface. Crusts were a small net contributor to CO2 efflux in the dry season but could be a net CO2 sink in the wet season. The biogeochemistry of the sediment is likely to facilitate rapid conversion of organic C from aquatic organisms, biological crusts and algal mats into inorganic carbonates. Although further work is required to improve estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of C, our data have demonstrated the substantial C store with the Makgadikgadi environment and the important role of biological crusts in the C cycle.

J	Miranda, LE				Miranda, L. E.			Depth as an organizer of fish assemblages in floodplain lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Depth reduction is a natural process in floodplain lakes, but in many basins has been accelerated by anthropogenic disturbances. A diverse set of 42 floodplain lakes in the Yazoo River Basin (Mississippi, USA) was examined to test the hypothesis of whether depth reduction was a key determinant of water quality and fish assemblage structure. Single and multiple variable analyses were applied to 10 commonly monitored water variables and 54 fish species. Results showed strong associations between depth and water characteristics, and between depth and fish assemblages. Deep lakes provided less variable environments, clearer water, and a wider range of microhabitats than shallow lakes. The greater environmental stability was reflected by the dominant species in the assemblages, which included a broader representation of large-body species, species less tolerant of extreme water quality, and more predators. Stability in deep lakes was further reflected by reduced among-lake variability in taxa representation. Fish assemblages in shallow lakes were more variable than deep lakes, and commonly dominated by opportunistic species that have early maturity, extended breeding seasons, small adult size, and short lifespan. Depth is a causal factor that drives many physical and chemical variables that contribute to organizing fish assemblages in floodplain lakes. Thus, correlations between fish and water transparency, temperature, oxygen, trophic state, habitat structure, and other environmental descriptors may ultimately be totally or partly regulated by depth. In basins undergoing rapid anthropogenic modifications, local changes forced by depth reductions may be expected to eliminate species available from the regional pool and could have considerable ecological implications.

The data set used in this paper is the first comprehensive collection of isotopic composition of NO3- in rivers of a large-scale basin in Asia. While the NO3- spatial concentration pattern showed significant seasonal variation, the spatial pattern of the delta N-15 of dissolved NO3- (delta(1)5N(NO3)) was more consistent throughout the year. The delta N-15(NO3) was significantly positively correlated with the population density of each catchment. A mass balance model assuming the delta N-15(NO3) and the flow rate of sewage effluent was developed. The model simulated the relationship between the population density and the delta N-15(NO3) reasonably well, suggesting that the dominant source contributing to the increase in delta N-15(NO3) was the sewage effluent. The spatiotemporal distribution of delta O-18(NO3) suggested the possibility of the addition of atmospherically derived NO3- through precipitation and was indicated by the hydrological pathways for NO3- exports in different land uses. In forest-dominated catchments with natural drainage systems, a slightly elevated delta O-18(NO3) signal remained in the stream water even during base flow conditions. This study demonstrated that multiscale, multi-isotopic investigation is a promising strategy for describing the spatial distribution of NO3- sources synoptically and is useful for evaluating the influences of land use change.

We also investigate the impact of time delay involved in the process of applying Phoslock after measuring the density of algal biomass in the lake. Moreover, the seasonal effects in the input of bioavailable phosphorus from the agricultural lands and the application rate of Phoslock have been investigated. Our simulation results show that the algal growth accelerates if the bioavailable phosphorus is excessively loaded through agricultural runoff and domestic discharges. However, algal biomass can be effectively controlled by employing Phoslock in a sufficiently large quantity. Further, we find that a delay in the application of Phoslock induces limit cycle oscillations. Furthermore, our findings show that the combined actions of delay and periodicity in the application of Phoslock bring forth dynamical complexity in the lake system by giving rise to higher periodic solutions and bursting patterns. Lastly, we investigate an optimal control problem to estimate the optimum dosage of Phoslock for the mitigation of algal biomass from the lake system.

Mapping its varying distribution using satellite images with high temporal resolution is valuable for studying suspended sediment transportation and diffusion patterns in inland lakes. A total of 255 sites were used to make remote-sensing reflectance measurements and surface water sampling at four Chinese inland lakes, i.e. Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, Dianchi Lake, and the Three Gorges Reservoir, at different seasons. A two-step retrieval method was then developed to estimate TSS concentration for contrasting Chinese inland lakes, which is described in this article. In the first step, a cluster method was applied for water classification using eight Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI) channel reflectance spectra simulated by spectral reflectance measured by an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Inc. spectrometer. This led to the classification of the water into three classes (1, 2, and 3), each with distinct optical characteristics. Based on the water quality, spectral absorption, and reflectance, the optical features in Class 1 were dominated by TSS, while Class 3 was dominated by chl-a and the optical characteristics of Class 2 were dominated jointly by TSS and chl-a. In the second step, class-specific TSS concentration retrieval algorithms were built. We found that the band ratio Band 8/Band 4 was suitable for Class 1, while the band ratio of Band 7/Band 4 was suitable for both Class 2 and Class 3. A comprehensive determination value, combining the spectral angle mapper and Euclidean distance, was adopted to identify the classes of image pixels when the method was applied to a GOCI image. Then, based on the pixel's class, the class-specific retrieval algorithm was selected for each pixel. The accuracy analysis showed that the performance of this two-step method was improved significantly compared to the unclassed method: the mean absolute percentage error decreased from 38.9% to 24.3% and the root mean square error decreased from 22.1 to 16.5 mg l(-1). Finally, the GOCI image acquired on 13 May 2013 was used as a demonstration to map the TSS concentration in Taihu Lake with a reasonably good accuracy and highly resolved spatial structure pattern.

Biogeochemistry of a large and deep tropical lake (Lake Kivu, East Africa: insights from a stable isotope study covering an annual cycle	BIOGEOSCIENCES												During this study, we investigated the seasonal variability of the concentration and the stable isotope composition of several inorganic and organic matter (OM) reservoirs in the large, oligotrophic and deep tropical Lake Kivu (East Africa). Data were acquired over 1 year at a fortnightly temporal resolution. The delta C-13 signature of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increased linearly with time during the rainy season, then suddenly decreased during the dry season due to vertical mixing with C-13-depleted DIC waters. The delta C-13 signature of the particulate organic carbon pool (POC) revealed the presence of a consistently abundant methanotrophic biomass in the oxycline throughout the year. We also noticed a seasonal shift during the dry season toward higher values in the delta N-15 of particulate nitrogen (PN) in the mixed layer and delta N-15-PN was significantly related to the contribution of cyanobacteria to the phytoplankton assemblage, suggesting that rainy season conditions could be more favourable to atmospheric nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Finally, zooplankton were slightly enriched in C-13 compared to the autochthonous POC pool, and the delta N-15 signature of zooplankton followed well the seasonal variability in delta N-15-PN, consistently 3.0 +/- 1.1% heavier than the PN pool. Together, delta C-13 and delta N-15 analysis suggests that zooplankton directly incorporate algal-derived OM in their biomass, and that they rely almost exclusively on this source of OM throughout the year in general agreement with the very low allochthonous OM inputs from rivers in Lake Kivu.

J	Gutsch, M; Hoffman, J				Gutsch, Michelle; Hoffman, Joel			A review of Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) life history in its native versus non-native range	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Invasive Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernua) has caused substantial ecological damage in North America, parts of Western Europe, Scandinavian countries, and the United Kingdom. The objectives of this review are to define Ruffe's native and non-native range, examine life history requirements, explore the life cycle, and differentiate between life stages. We compare data from its native and non-native ranges to determine if there are any differences in habitat, size, age, genotype, or seasonal migration. Literature from both the native and non-native ranges of Ruffe, with some rare, translated literature, is used. In each life stage, Ruffe exhibit plasticity with regard to chemical, physical, biological, and habitat requirements. Adult Ruffe has characteristics that allow them to adapt to a range of environments, including rapid maturation, relatively long life and large size (allowing them to reproduce many times in large batches), batch spawning, genotype and phenotype (having plasticity in their genetic expression), tolerance to a wide range of water quality, broad diet, and multiple dispersal periods. There is, however, variability among these characteristics between the native, non-native North American, and European non-native populations, which presents a challenge to managing populations based on life history characteristics. Monitoring and preventative strategies are important because, based on Ruffe's variable life history strategies and its recent range expansion, all of the Laurentian Great Lakes and many other water bodies in the UK, Europe, and Norway are vulnerable to Ruffe establishment.																			0960-3166	1573-5184				JUN	2016	26	2					213	233		10.1007/s11160-016-9422-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-016-9422-5													WOS:000376273200006

Current Evolution of the Salt Composition of Waters in the Western Basin of the South Aral Sea	OCEANOLOGY												Hydrochemical studies were carried out in the western basin of the South Aral Sea, within Uzbekistan, during the expedition in 2019. Water samples were collected in the deep-water part of the western basin from various horizons. The maximum depth of the lake at the time of sampling was 30 m. This work is a part of studies of the evolution of residual water bodies of the Aral Sea. It describes the evolution of the chemical composition of the Aral-Sea water observed in the lake since the beginning of its desiccation and continuing to the present time in all residual water bodies of the Aral Sea. It is established that currently the deep-water part of the western basin of the South Aral Sea has a salinity of similar to 140 parts per thousand and occupies an intermediate position between the brackish North Aral Sea and the hypersaline Chernyshev Bay of the South Aral Sea. The salinity of the lake increases every year and has seasonal changes along with fluctuations in the lake level. It is found that the density increases by 1.2 kg/m(3) both in the surface and bottom layers with increasing salinity by each 1 parts per thousand.

Specific Heat Capacity Measurements of Selected Meteorites for Planetary Surface Temperature Modeling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Specific heat capacity Cp(T) is an intrinsic regolith property controlling planetary surface temperatures along with the albedo, density, and thermal conductivity. Cp(T) depends on material composition and temperature. Generally, modelers assume a fixed specific heat capacity value, or a standard temperature dependence derived from lunar basalts, mainly because of limited composition-specific data at low temperatures relevant to planetary surfaces. In addition, Cp(T) only appears to vary by a small factor across various materials, in contrast with the bulk regolith thermal conductivity, which ranges over similar to 3-4 orders of magnitude as a function of the regolith physical state (grain size, cementation, sintering, etc.). For these reasons, the impact of the basaltic assumption on modeled surface temperature is often considered unimportant although this assumption is not particularly well constrained. In this paper, we present specific heat capacity measurements and parameterizations from similar to 90 to similar to 290 K of 28 meteorites including those possibly originating from Mars and Vesta, and covering a wide range of planetary surface compositions. Planetary surface temperatures calculated using composition-specific Cp(T) are within +/- 2 K of model runs assuming a basaltic composition. This +/- 2 K range approaches or exceeds typical instrumental noise or other sources of modeling uncertainties. These results suggest that a basaltic assumption for Cp(T) is generally adequate for the thermal characterization of a wide range of planetary surfaces, but possibly inadequate when looking at leveraging subtle trends to constrain subsurface layering, roughness, or seasonal/diurnal volatile transfer.					; Edwards, Christopher/A-4828-2010; Choukroun, Mathieu/F-3146-2017	Piqueux, Sylvain/0000-0003-0485-2908; Edwards, Christopher/0000-0002-8096-9633; Bapst, Jonathan/0000-0003-1176-7613													2169-9097	2169-9100				NOV	2021	126	11							e2021JE007003	10.1029/2021JE007003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JE007003													WOS:000722451500024

Temporal correspondence of selenium and mercury, among brine shrimp and water in Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The specific source of high burdens of selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) in several bird species at Great Salt Lake (GSL) remain unknown. Frequent co-located water and brine shrimp samples were collected during 2016 through 2017 to identify potential correlations of element concentrations among brines and brine shrimp, a keystone species in the GSL. Like many aquatic systems, GSL is characterized by elevated methyl mercury (MeHg) in deep waters. However, in contrast to thermally-stratified aquatic systems, biota in the salinity-stratified GSL do not reside in its deep waters, obscuring the presumed relationship between elevated MeHg in biota and in the deep brine. Brine shrimp and water column (shallow and deep, filtered and unfiltered) samples were collected from six sites spanning the South Arm of GSL approximately every other month. Mercury concentrations in brine shrimp (on average 89% of which is MeHg) were correlated only with total mercury in surface filtered water, and displayed little spatial variability, but consistent seasonal trends across the two sampled years. In contrast to Hg, temporal correspondence was observed between Se concentrations in brine shrimp and those in all water samples regardless of filtering and depth, with maxima and minima at higher-than-seasonal frequency. The data suggest a spatially diffuse source of bioavailable mercury to the shallow brine that responds to seasonal influences, for which the underlying deep brine, surficial sediments, and overlying atmosphere were evaluated in terms of potential temporal correspondence to shallow brine and brine shrimp Hg concentrations, as well as potential to mix across the extent of the shallow brine. Bioaccumulation factors were at the low end of those reported for marine systems, and decreased at higher trace element concentrations in water. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, B; Wan, RR; Yang, GS				Li, Bing; Wan, Rongrong; Yang, Guishan			Centennial dynamics of floodplain wetland in the largest freshwater lake in China: Implications on floodplain lake restoration	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Long-term mapping of floodplain wetland dynamics is fundamental for wetland protection and restoration, but it is restricted to decadal scales using satellite observations owing to scarcity of spatial data over long-term scales. The present study concentrates on the centennial dynamics of floodplain wetland in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. Historical topographic maps and Landsat imagery were combined to reconstruct the centennial floodplain wetland map series. A robust random forest algorithm for the land cover classification was used to investigate the conversion of the floodplain wetland to other land cover types and quantify the magnitude of the influence of hydrological disconnection over the past century. Results show that the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland experienced a net loss of 35.7 %, from 5024.3 km2 in the 1920s-1940s to 3232.1 km2 in the 2020s, with the floodplain wetland loss occurring mostly from the 1950s to the 1970s. In addition, agricultural encroachment was identified as the predominant driver of floodplain wetland loss, with a total area of 931.0 km2 of the floodplain wetland converted into cropland. Furthermore, approximately 600 km2 of sub-lakes (larger than 1 km2) became isolated from the floodplain and thus unaffected by seasonal flood pulses, which highlights the need to account for the impact of hydrological disconnection on floodplain wetland dynamics. This study indicated the combination of historical maps and satellite observations as an effective tool to track long-term wetland changes. The resultant dataset provides an extended baseline and could shed some light on floodplain wetland conservation and restoration.

The Mid-Late Holocene between the Predynastic to Old Kingdom was terrestrial wetland habitat with high seasonal rainfall and/or Nile flood as revealed by the dominance of Cyperaceae pollen. Therefore, people gathered in and around the Nile Valley and the agricultural activities increased. During the early stage of Late Holocene coincident with the Old Kingdom to Middle Kingdom, the paleoclimate became more arid with low seasonal precipitation and/or Nile flood as reflected by the increasing abundance of Poaceae pollen and the absence of diatoms in addition to low values of TOC, TN, TS, C/S and high values of C/N. These drought conditions possibly played a role in the Old Kingdom collapsing. The late stage of the Late Holocene showed terrestrial wetland habitat with brackish conditions coupled with aquatic contribution under oxic conditions as inferred by the dominance of Typha sp. and Amaranthaceae pollens as well as the diatom assemblages. The relatively high values of TOC, C/N, C/S coupled with low values of TS and TN reveal terrestrial origin of organic matter. The Late Holocene-recent has turned into a terrestrial wetland habitat with more brackish conditions and increasing in the seasonal rainfall as supported by the marked increasing of Cyperaceae pollen. The overall increase of the Diatom Inferred Salinity (DIS) as well as the marked increasing of C/S, TN and decreasing of TOC, C/N and TS values towards the recent point to higher saline brackish wetland paleoenvironment and a terrestrial origin of the organic matter with more aquatic contribution under oxic conditions.

Implementing a modified version of field methods applied in our survey of cave systems and Pleistocene cave sediments, the main goal of this systematic research focused on the identification of intact stratified remains from either stratigraphic sections or on remnants of exposed ancient surfaces. The project area consisted of the active opencast lignite mine of Megalopolis, where access to recently exposed sections were abundant, and of the alluvial fans in the surrounding uplands, where hominins exploited the commanding views of the ancient lake. This paper presents the survey results and applied field methods for conducting archaeological research within the remnants of an Early to Middle Pleistocene ancient lake system. The project succeeded in identifying at least five surface and stratified sites, the latter including the Lower Paleolithic remains of Marathousa-1. This site is currently under investigation, but has already yielded the oldest chronometrically dated archaeological remains in Greece. Therefore, PaGE has not only managed to place mainland Greece on the Lower Paleolithic map of Europe, but has also successfully tested a methodological corpus for survey research targeting the earliest phases of the Paleolithic period in a Mediterranean landscape.

Despite there being archaeological evidence of a human presence in this area spanning several millennia, the results from pollen analysis indicate only a small-scale human impact on vegetation during the prehistory, reinforcing existing ideas that lifeways based upon hunting, fishing and gathering (h-f-g) were maintained over an extended period of time at this location. Human activities remained relatively extensive during the historical periods, although the first evidence of cereal cultivation dates to the Middle Ages. The results of earlier investigation, which suggested that cereal cultivation and animal husbandry may have begun at Serteya in the Late Neolithic, have not been confirmed by the presented dataset (or, at least, cannot be seen in it). The results from macrobotanical analysis reveal a gradual lowering of the lake-level, but with intervening transgression phases ca. 5550-3600 cal. BC and, more briefly, around the time of the 4.2 ka BP cooling event. The Late Neolithic pile dwelling settlement (dated to 2500-2200 cal. BC) that was present in the immediate area, and from which the samples are drawn, was situated in shallow water - the depth of which varied seasonally - and in the close vicinity of the shoreline. The gathering of berries and nuts, as well as starch-rich aquatic plants, seems to have played an important role in subsistence, which was further supported by hunting and fishing. Following a brief phase during which the pile dwelling settlement went into decline, the increased exploitation of aquatic plants appears to have intensified between ca. 2200 and 2000 cal. BC.

Late Pleistocene climate inferences from a water balance model of Jakes Valley, Nevada (USA)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Shorelines that formed in closed watershed-lake systems record past climate conditions. A simple monthly water balance model was used to explore the link between past climates, paleoclimate proxies, and the hydrologic system response of a closed watershed-lake system in the Great Basin, USA. The model was applied at a high spatial resolution and calibrated with available modern hydroclimate and watershed data and then used with existing paleolake shoreline estimates to investigate how climate and hydrologic conditions in the late Pleistocene differed from modern conditions. A range of climate conditions, DT (0 to -8 degrees C) and DP (1.9-2.4) from the modern climate, resulted in steady model simulations of the late Pleistocene lake high-stand. Modeling results also indicate the watershedlake system response is much more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in temperature, and that the range of possible combinations of these variables can be reduced significantly when the results are compared with an independent modeling study that inferred paleoclimate conditions from glacial moraines in the Wind River Range near the eastern portion of the Great Basin. The modeling effort also revealed that physiographic heterogeneities and seasonality play a significant role in how the watershed-lake system responds to changes in precipitation and temperature, highlighting the importance of simulating the system behavior with an appropriate degree of spatial resolution. The significance of model calibration and performance evaluation over the modern period was demonstrated through a comparison of the calibrated model results with those obtained using default parameter values with the original model.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2016	56	2-3					109	122		10.1007/s10933-016-9897-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9897-z													WOS:000383989300002
J	Dien, NT; Hirai, Y; Miyazaki, T; Sakai, S				Nguyen Thanh Dien; Hirai, Yasuhiro; Miyazaki, Toru; Sakai, Shin-ichi			Factors influencing atmospheric concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in Japan	CHEMOSPHERE												We used polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) data in air at 38 sites across Japan (2009-2012), which were measured by the Japan Ministry of Environment (JMOE), to elucidate the time trend and seasonality of atmospheric PBDEs. In order to address few (7% for BDE-47) to many (63% for BDE-153 and 183) non-detect data, Tobit model, also called a censored regression model was used. The model revealed that the concentrations of PBDE congeners were influenced by a combination of year, temperature, rainfall rate, and population density. Greater declines were observed for BDE-47, -99, -153 and -183 (-21, -25, -17, -23%/year, p < 0.05) than for BDE-209 (-6%/year, p = 0.065). These trends were consistent with the estimated trends of penta-, octa- and deca-BDE contained in in-use products based on domestic demand for PBDEs in Japan and product lifespan. Seasonal patterns were opposite for light congeners (BDE-47 and -99), which increased with temperature, and heavy congeners (BDE-183, and -209), which decreased with temperature. Temperature-dependent emission (evaporation) for light congeners and temperature-independent emission (abrasion) for heavy congeners, coupled with seasonality of atmospheric boundary layer height, might explain these seasonal patterns. Human population density showed a positive correlation with all PBDE congener concentrations, whereas PBDEs showed negative correlation with rainfall rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is large uncertainty associated with CH4 emissions from freshwater environments to the atmosphere, because of a lack of understanding in the spatial and temporal dynamics of CH4 sources and sinks, as well as underlying mechanisms and processes. In this study, we investigated the concentrations and stable carbon (delta C-13-CH4) and hydrogen (delta H-2-CH4) isotope composition of CH4 in a small eutrophic lake (Lake Willersinnweiher) with seasonal stratification and its spatial and temporal variation. We found that while supersaturation of CH4 in the entire water column was present throughout the whole year, the isotopic composition of CH4 in sediment and water column varied depending on lake stratification, physiochemical conditions, and lake depth. During the stratification period, isotopic characteristics of pelagic surface water CH4 differed from littoral and sedimentary CH4, suggesting likely mixing of CH4 from different sources including vertical and lateral input as well as groundwater input and potentially oxic methane production in the mixed surface water layer. Aerobic CH4 oxidation indicated by a strong increase in both delta C-13-CH4 and delta H-2-CH4 values at the bottom of the oxycline was found to significantly reduce upward migrating CH4 released at the sediment-water interface. In the sediment, stable isotope characteristics of CH4 showed an increasing dominance of the acetoclastic CH4 formation pathway from the pelagic towards the littoral area. Furthermore, the occurrence of sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation in the sediment was suggested by an increase in delta C-13-CH4 and delta H-2-CH4 values. During the mixing period, the isotopic CH4 composition of the water column was distinctively less negative than during the stratification period potentially resulting from a greater impact of groundwater CH4 input compared to the stratification period. Our findings implicate that the application of concentrations and dual isotope measurements of CH4 is a promising approach for constraining CH4 sinks and sources in Lake Willersinnweiher and potentially other small lakes to clearly disentangle the complex CH4 dynamics in lakes both spatially and seasonally.

This study aims to investigate the levels and partitioning of OPEs in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments of landscape waters across eleven parks in the city of Chengdu, a megacity in Southwest China. The average concentration of Sigma 6OPEs in the SPM samples (median: 2.94 x 10(3) ng/L, 6.88 x 10(4) ng/g dry weight) was 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the surface water (median: 359 ng/L) and sediment (median: 82.8 ng/g) samples. Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP), tris-(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate (TCEP) and trichloropropyl phosphate (TCIPP) were the primary OPE pollutants in the surface water and SPM samples, while TnBP, tris-(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and tris-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) predominated the sediment samples. The higher log K-oc values of OPEs in park landscape water bodies estimated in the present study relative to previous studies could be explained by the environmental conditions, such as the sources of the inputs and the hydraulic retention times in these surface waters.

Two morphologically similar pre-dams of the large Rappbode reservoir system in Germany were studied for oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, nitrate reduction, manganese and iron reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis. Rates were obtained by calculations from hypolimnion size and hypolimnetic water chemistry and from incubation of sediment samples (manganese and iron reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis only). Length of anoxic conditions (anoxic factor) and anaerobic process rates were generally higher for Hassel pre-dam, a water body with 58% grasslands and agriculture in its catchment. Rappbode pre-dam had higher iron reduction rates. Oxygen consumption and sulfate reduction (and nitrate reduction for Hassel pre-dam) were the most important respiratory processes. While hypolimnion chemistry was similar and showed mainly temporal differences in seasonal development, the pre-dam sediments differed considerably with roughly twofold higher microbial biomass and 10(2)-10(4) fold higher counts of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes in Hassel pre-dam compared to Rappbode pre-dam. These differences can be explained by the higher nutrient input, longer water retention time, and consequently higher biomass production in Hassel pre-dam. The view of microbial activities against known loads of solutes also implies that the quality of allochthonous organic matter and particulate fluxes likely governs respiratory processes in the pre-dams by providing electron donors and acceptors.

This study focuses on the assessment of public health risks associated with drinking water sources in the sub -basin. In accordance with WHO guidelines, 120 water samples were collected from 60 water supply schemes in dry and wet seasons located in areas with low and high water pollution risk (WPR). Multi -meter, Photometer, Digital Arsenator, and Microbiological test kit measured the concentration of parameters. The assessment uses methods of hazard identification, exposure and dose -response analysis, and risk characterization, including Hazard Quotient (HQ), Cancer Risk (CR), Hazard Index (HI), and probability of infection. Monte Carlo simulation analyzes non -cancer risks from Nitrite, Nitrate, Chromium, Iron, Fluoride, and Arsenic, and CRs from Chromium and Arsenic, and infection risks from Escherichia coli (E.coli). As a result, the Hazard Quotient (HQ) of Nitrate was beyond unity (HQ > 1) in the dry season for all groups. HQ of Chromium was HQ > 1 for Women (1.1E+00) and Children (1.4E+00) in the wet season in the high WPR area. Chromium HQ > 1 for children (1.4E+00) in the wet season and Fluoride (HQ > 1) for Children (3.2E+00) in the dry season in the low WPR area. Arsenic CR was above 1 in 10,000 persons for children in the dry season, for all groups, and for women and children in the wet season in the high WPR areas. The CR of chromium ranged from 1 in 1000 persons, which is beyond the limit. Moreover, the Hazard Index (HI) was higher than the unity (HI > 1) for most cases. All E coli infection risks daily and annually exceeded the acceptable risks. Therefore, Public health concerns in the Sub -basin were quantified, and evidences were generated for risk management to undertake source protection through integrated watershed management and appropriate water treatment technologies.

J	Melese, H; Debella, HJ				Melese, Hana; Debella, Habte Jebessa			Temporal phytoplankton dynamics and environmental variables in four Ethiopian soda lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS RESEARCH												We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton composition, chlorophyll-a as a proxy for algal biomass, and abundance in relation to environmental parameters in four Ethiopian soda lakes: Arenguade, Beseka, Chittu, and Shala. Triplicate water samples were collected from each lake from January to December 2020, four times in different seasons. Lake Chittu had the highest chlorophyll-a concentration, followed by Lake Arenguade, Beseka and Shala. Chlorophyll-a concentrations generally increased during the post rainy and dry season. The results of LR models are high for lakes Arengude, Beseka and Chittu. Lakes Shala and Beseka had the highest number of phytoplankton taxa, with both taxa composition and abundance dominated by Bacillariophyceae. Cyanoprokaryota, particularly Limnospira fusiformis, predominated in the abundance of Lakes Arenguade and Chittu. Water temperature, Secchi depth, turbidity, electrical conductivity, soluble reactive phosphorus, nitrate and silica significantly influenced the phytoplankton community structure. Long-term trend analysis revealed changes in phytoplankton biomass and lake taxonomic composition. The alteration in phytoplankton biomass and species composition of the lakes could be attributed to three factors: (1) frequent high-velocity explosions conducted for seismological studies in the past. This impact caused a dramatic increase in lake level in the case of Lake Beseka leading to a drop in nutrient concentration; (2) climate change and (3) salt content. Overall, our findings suggest that phytoplankton composition, biomass, and abundance varied according to seasonal fluctuations, emphasizing the possible effects of anthropogenic and natural causes on their community structure.

J	Wherry, SA; Schenk, L				Wherry, Susan A.; Schenk, Liam			Examining the Effect of Physicochemical and Meteorological Variables on Water Quality Indicators of Harmful Algal Blooms in a Shallow Hypereutrophic Lake Using Machine Learning Techniques	ACS ES&T WATER												Two independent machine learning techniques, boosted regression trees and artificial neural networks, were used to examine the physicochemical and meteorological variables that affect the seasonal growth and decline of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in a shallow, hypereutrophic lake in southern Oregon. High temporal resolution data collected at four monitoring locations were aggregated into daily timesteps to create two response variables: (1) daily maximum pH (pH(max)), representing HAB growth, and (2) daily minimum dissolved oxygen (DOmin), representing HAB decline. Predictors included meteorological and physical data, estimates of external phosphorus loading, and previous-year average nutrient concentrations, and excluded HAB biomass and internal phosphorus loading. The predictors that captured seasonal changes in both pH(max) and DOmin were temperature, inflows, lake-surface elevation, and external phosphorus loading, while short-term changes were captured by measures of stratification, temperature, and wind speed. The pH(max) models had similar fits with leave-one-year-out cross-validation (LOYO-CV) R-2 values of 0.2-0.43 (median = 0.40). The DOmin models for the deeper locations had LOYO-CV R-2 values of 0.27-0.43 compared to 0.1-0.25 for the shallower locations. Model performance was affected by variability due to patchiness of HABs, measurement uncertainty, and advection.

J	Lampert, W				Lampert, Winfried			Daphnia: Model herbivore, predator and prey	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					4th Symposium for European Freshwater Science (SEFS 4)	AUG, 2005	Jagiellonian Univ, Cracow, POLAND		Jagiellonian Univ			In the past 30 years, Daphnia has become a model organism in aquatic ecology. I review the changing concepts and paradigms in plankton ecology as reflected in the work on Daphnia. The availability of radiotracers favoured a new physiological approach that resulted in better energetic models and more reliable estimates of filtering rates. This led to deeper insights into the role of herbivore grazing on phytoplankton and microbial communities, and nutrient recycling. It provided a conceptual basis for general hypotheses on predictable seasonal successions (e.g. the PEG model). On the other hand, increasing knowledge about selective predation on zooplankton triggered population dynamic models and gave explanations for changing community structures. The Size-Efficiency-Hypothesis generated a framework for studies on trade-offs between competitive ability and susceptibility to predation. Daphnia was now in the centre of interaction-based concepts, being predator and prey at the same time. It was the backbone of practical applications of the theory in food-web manipulations. When ultimate factors came into the focus, Daphnia played an important role in explaining striking phenomena like diel vertical migration and cyclomorphosis. Its central position in food-webs, the unique propagation mode, easy cultivation and accessibility by molecular genetic methods made it a favourite object for studies in evolutionary ecology, concerning local adaptation, evolution of defences and life histories, induced phenotypic change, and genetic diversity. The large advantage of Daphnia over other biological model organisms is that its importance in pelagic freshwater systems is undoubtedly known. Hence there is a direct way of applying the results to ecological systems.																			1505-2249						2006	54	4					607	620																WOS:000243236300006

Assessment of heavy metal contamination and sediment characteristics in Ozomu lake, southern Nigeria: Implications for environmental health	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												This study investigates heavy metal concentrations and surface sediment characteristics in the Ozomu Lake, located in southern region of Nigeria. Sediment samples were systematically collected across three stations, over six months, spanning from March to August. This period encompasses the transition from the late dry season to the early wet season, offering valuable insights into the seasonal variations of heavy metal distribution and sediment properties. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment were determined using standard methods, along with the analysis of particle size distribution and organic content (% organic carbon and % organic matter). Essential findings reveal significant values. Iron (Fe) averaged 1194.86 mg/kg, zinc (Zn) 30.71 mg/kg, copper (Cu) 14.80 mg/kg, manganese (Mn) 17.43 mg/kg, lead (Pb) 1.17 mg/kg, and cadmium (Cd) 0.18 mg/kg. Enrichment factor (EF) assessments indicate notable enrichment in Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Cd. Key sediment properties include total organic carbon (%TOC) at 4.46%, total organic matter (%TOM) at 7.72%, and particle size distribution with clay at 8.99%, silt at 6.24%, and sand at 84.77%. Principal component analysis (PCA) uncovers intricate relationships among heavy metals, shedding light on their sources and distribution. Geoaccumulation indices (Igeo) reveal moderate pollution levels in Fe and Cd, suggesting potential ecological risks. Conversely, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Pb remain within unpolluted ranges. The study enhances our understanding of heavy metal contamination in Ozomu Lake, emphasizing the need for tailored management and conservation strategies. Future research should explore seasonal variations and specific pollution sources in the lake's catchment area. This study contributes valuable insights into Ozomu Lake's environmental dynamics and underscores the importance of sustainable management for its long-term health and ecological integrity.																			2307-4108	2307-4116				APR	2024	51	2							100192	10.1016/j.kjs.2024.100192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.kjs.2024.100192		JAN 2024											WOS:001175475600001

In order to increase our understanding of the characteristics and potential impact zone of atmospheric aerosols in the Aral Sea region, we evaluated seasonal and diurnal variation of aerosols and identified the zone most frequently impacted by aerosols from the Aral Sea region using CALIPSO data and the HYSPLIT model. The results showed that polluted dust and dust were the two most commonly observed aerosol subtypes in the Aral Sea region with the two accounting for over 75% of observed aerosols. Occurrence frequencies of polluted dust, clean continental, polluted continental/smoke, and elevated smoke showed obvious seasonal and diurnal variations, while occurrence frequency of dust only showed obvious seasonal variation. Vertically, the occurrence frequencies of all aerosol subtypes except dust showed significant diurnal variation at all levels. The thickness of polluted dust layers and dust layers exhibited same seasonal and diurnal variations with a value of more than 1.0 km year-round, and the layer thickness of clean continental and polluted continental/smoke shared the same seasonal and diurnal variation features. The zone most severely impacted by aerosols from the Aral Sea region, covering an area of approximately 2 million km(2), was mainly distributed in the vicinity of the Aral Sea region, including western Kazakhstan, and most of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The results provide direct support for positioning monitoring of aeolian dust deposition and human health protection in the Aral Sea region.					ge, yongxiao/K-1251-2012; Kulmatov, Rashid/C-7233-2019; Issanova, Gulnura/AAN-9181-2021	Galymzhan, Saparov/0000-0002-6392-2032; Issanova, Gulnura/0000-0002-4496-0463; , Wu Na/0000-0001-7205-1390; ji, li li/0000-0001-8483-1554; 														1660-4601				NOV	2022	19	21							14144	10.3390/ijerph192114144	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192114144								36361020					WOS:000881215700001

Lake Van is the world's largest soda lake, and there are no studies on seasonal arsenic pollution and arsenic-resistant bacteria. We aimed to determine the amount of arsenic in the lake water and sediment, to isolate arsenic-metabolizing anaerobic bacteria and their identification, and determination of arsenic metabolism. Sampling was done from 7.5 m to represent the four seasons. Metal contents were determined by using ICP-MS. Pure cultures were obtained using the Hungate technique. Growth characteristics of the strains were determined at different conditions as well as at arsenate and arsenite concentrations. Molecular studies were also carried out for various resistance genes. Our results showed that Lake Van's total arsenic amount changes seasonally. As a result of 16S rRNA sequencing, it was determined that the isolates were members of 8 genera with arsC resistance genes. In conclusion, to sustain water resources, it is necessary to prevent chemical and microorganism-based pollution. It is thought that the arsenic-resistant bacteria obtained as a result of this study will contribute to the solution of environmental arsenic pollution problems, as they are the first data and provide the necessary basic data for the bioremediation studies of arsenic from contaminated environmental habitats. At the same time, the first data that will contribute to the creation of the seasonal arsenic map of Lake Van are obtained.					; Omeroglu, Esra/D-3309-2014	Sudagidan, Mert/0000-0002-3980-8344; ERSOY OMEROGLU, ESRA/0000-0002-6726-9157; OGUN, ERDAL/0000-0001-8280-4245														2075-1729				NOV	2022	12	11							1900	10.3390/life12111900	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life12111900								36431035					WOS:000895610300001

In the last five years, this lake has experienced extreme variations in its surface area and water levels, including very significant declines, which has impacted the supply of electricity. This study aimed to assess temporal variations in the water levels of Lake Buyo using radar altimetry. Altimetric data from the Sentinel-3A satellite on Lake Buyo (tracks 16 (orbit 8) and 743 (orbit 372)) were selected over the period from 31 May 2016 to 12 June 2021 and compared to the in situ measurements provided by the Direction de la Production de l'Electricite de Cote d'Ivoire (DPE-CI). The extraction of the time series of the Sentinel-3A altimetric water levels and their corrections (geophysical and environmental corrections) were carried out with the ALTiS software. The results showed an overall agreement between the altimetric water levels and the in situ measurements, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) ranging from 0.98 to 0.99 obtained, as well as a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient also between 0.98 and 0.99. Further, the bias (0.12 m and 0.13 m) and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.38 and 0.67 m) values showed that the results were acceptable. The analysis of the water levels time series allowed for the identification of two main periods: March to October and November to February. The first period corresponded to a high level period, recording a maximum level of 200.06 m. The second period, from November to March, was characterized by a drop in the water level, recording a minimum level of 187.42 m. The water levels time series provided by Sentinel-3 allowed us to appreciate the respective influences of seasonal and interannual variations on rainfall and the contributions of the Sassandra River tributaries to the water levels of Lake Buyo.

However, observation data has been limited due to the extreme climates and complex terrain of this region. To address these issues, four representative methods, Penman-Monteith (PM), Priestley-Taylor (PT), Hargreaves-Samani (HS), and Mahringer (MG) methods, were adopted to estimate ET, which were then compared with ET measured using Eddy Covariance (EC) for five alpine meadow sites during the growing seasons from 2010 to 2014. And each site was measured for one growing season during this period. The results demonstrate that the PT method outperformed at all sites with a coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.76 to 0.94 and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.41 to 0.62 mm d(-1). The PM method showed better performance than HS and MG methods, and the HS method produced relatively acceptable results with higher R-2 (0.46) and lower RMSE (0.89 mm d(-1)) compared to MG method with R-2 of 0.16 and RMSE of 1.62 mm d(-1), while MG underestimated ET at all alpine meadow sites. Therefore, the PT method, being the simpler approach and less data dependent, is recommended to estimate ET for alpine meadow areas in the Tibetan Plateau. The PM method produced reliable results when available data were sufficient, and the HS method proved to be a complementary method when variables were insufficient. On the contrary, the MG method always underestimated ET and is, thus, not suitable for alpine meadows. These results provide a basis for estimating ET on the Tibetan Plateau for annual data collection, analysis, and future studies.

The countries of this area are characterized by a huge variety from social, cultural, economic and environmental point of view. In particular, water distribution is inhomogeneous between the North, East, and South; even the type of water sources and the related quantity and quality problems differ country by country. Potable water comes from brackish and seawater, surface water, groundwater and water reservoirs with each source face different issues. The main problem of brackish and seawater for example is the high salinity and the contamination by disinfection byproducts, in addition to the microbiological and chemical contamination due to human activities that characterize also other surface water sources. Groundwater is also affected by human activity and it is not exempted from salinity because of the water intrusion. Moreover, water reservoirs are often contaminated by seasonal algal blooms. Technologies applied for drinking water treatment vary country by country. The paper presents the main treatment processes associated with the main water pollutants, according to the Mediterranean region. Case studies of drinking water treatment plants are also analyzed, presenting alternative technologies appropriate for specific contexts, among others. The characteristics of each specific context should be carefully analyzed in order to develop the most appropriate technologies; high-end technologies for drinking water treatment may not be applied equally to all countries or communities of						SORLINI, Sabrina/0000-0001-7057-5473													1582-9596	1843-3707				JUL	2015	14	7					1721	1733		10.30638/eemj.2015.183	http://dx.doi.org/10.30638/eemj.2015.183													WOS:000360500300026
J	Tilahun, G; Ahlgren, G				Tilahun, Girma; Ahlgren, Gunnel			Seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes Ziway, Awassa and Chamo - The basis for fish production	LIMNOLOGICA												Seasonal variations in the biomass (Chl a) and primary production (C-14-method) of phytoplankton were studied during 12 months of 2005 in the three Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes (ERVL) Ziway, Awassa and Chamo. Chl a showed an average value of 40, 20, and 30 mg m(-3) for the three lakes, respectively. Integrated areal primary production for the total phytoplankton (g C m(2) d(-1)) varied 2-fold in the three lakes but on different levels, from 0.67-1.8 in L Ziway, 1.8-4.6 in L. Awassa, and 1.0-2.6 in L Chamo. The overall photosynthetic efficiency of utilizing photosynthetically active radiation by the phytoplankton on molar basis (mmol C mol of photons(-1)) resulted in an average value of 1.4 for L. Ziway, 3.5 for L. Awassa and 1.6 for L. Chamo. Among the different factors regulating phytoplankton primary productivity, light penetration and nutrients were the most important in the three lakes. The seasonal variations of incident radiation (most values between 5 and 7 E m(2) h(-1)) and water temperature (most values between 22 and 24 degrees C) were small and unlikely to result in the marked differences in phytoplankton primary production. Although relative increase in nutrient concentrations occurred following the rainy periods, the major algal nutrients were either consistently low (nitrate and/or silicate) or high (phosphate and/or ammonium) and remained within a narrow range for most of the study period in all the three lakes. Consequently, phytoplankton biomass and primary production seem to be maintained more by nutrient regeneration or turnover (facilitated by high temperature) than by allochthonous nutrient input. This would be coupled with wind-induced mixing that would play an important role in determining hydrographic characteristics (water column structure) and the associated redistribution of nutrients and phytoplankton, the availability of light and subsequently the spatial (vertical) and temporal patterns of phytoplankton production in these three ERVL. Phytoplankton production (PP) is regarded as a good predictor of fish yield in lakes and seasonal measurements of PP is a prerequisite for good such estimates. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Liver size reveals social status in the African cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Wild groups (n = 167) of the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher, were used to investigate how social status and sex influence liver investment. In contrast to expectations, males and females (controlling for body size) had similar liver investment and subordinates (both sexes) had relatively larger livers compared with dominants. Three hypotheses were considered for why social status results in liver size disparity: liver mass might reflect status-dependent differences in (1) energy expenditure, (2) energy storage and (3) energy acquisition. First, dominants performed more energetically costly behaviours (e.g. social policing and care) compared with subordinates, supporting the notion that energy expenditure drives liver investment. Moreover, dominants in large groups (with many subordinates to monitor) and those holding multiple territories (with large areas to patrol), tended to have smaller livers. Second, subordinates did not appear to use the liver as a strategic energy storage organ. In laboratory and field experiments, subordinates ascending in rank had similar or larger livers during periods of rapid growth compared with non-ascending controls. Third, although subordinates fed more frequently than dominants, a negative relationship was found between feeding rates and liver size. Hence, these results contrast with previous liver studies and suggest that liver investment patterns were linked to status-driven differences in energy expenditure but not to energy intake or storage in N. pulcher.

The Dziani Dzaha (Mayotte, Indian Ocean) is a tropical, saline, alkaline crater lake that has recently been presented as a modern analog of Proterozoic Oceans due to its thalassohaline classification (having water of marine origin) and specific biogeochemical characteristics. Continuous intense photosynthetic production and microbial mineralization keep most of the water column permanently aphotic and anoxic preventing the development of a euxinic (sulfidic and anoxic) photic zone despite a high sulfide/sulfate ratio and the presence of permanent or seasonal haloclines. In this study, the molecular composition of the organic matter in Lake Dziani Dzaha was investigated and compared to the microbial diversity evaluated through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, over two contrasting seasons (rainy vs. dry) that influence water column stratification. Depth profiles of organic biomarker concentrations (chlorophyll-a and lipid biomarkers) and bacterial and archaeal OTU abundances appeared to be strongly dependent on the presence of aphotic haloclines and euxinia. OTU abundances revealed the importance of specific haloalkaliphilic bacterial and archaeal assemblages in phytoplanktonic biomass recycling and the biogeochemical functioning of the lake, suggesting new haloalkaline non-phototrophic anaerobic microbial precursors for some of the lipid biomarkers. Uncultured Firmicutes from the family Syntrophomonadaceae (Clostridiales), and Bacteroidetes from the ML635J-40 aquatic group, emerged as abundant chemotrophic bacterial members in the anoxic or euxinic waters and were probably responsible for the production of short-chain n-alkenes, wax esters, diplopterol, and tetrahymanol. Halocline-dependent euxinia also had a strong impact on the archaeal community which was dominated by Woesearchaeota in the sulfide-free waters. In the euxinic waters, methanogenic Euryarchaeota from the Methanomicrobia, Thermoplasmata, and WSA2 classes dominated and were likely at the origin of common hydrocarbon biomarkers of methanogens (phytane, pentamethyl-eicosenes, and partially hydrogenated squalene).

Modelling lake stage and water balance of Lake Tana, Ethiopia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The level of Lake Tana, Ethiopia, fluctuates annually and seasonally following the patterns of changes in precipitation. In this study, a mass balance approach is used to estimate the hydrological balance of the lake. Water influx from four major rivers, subsurface inflow from the floodplains, precipitation, outflow from the lake constituting river discharge and evapotranspiration from the lake are analysed on monthly and annual bases. Spatial interpolation of precipitation using rain gauge data was conducted using kriging. Outflow from the lake was identified as the evaporation from the lake's surface as well as discharge at the outlet where the Blue Nile commences. Groundwater inflow is estimated using MODular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water FLOW model software that showed air aligned flow pattern to the river channels. The groundwater outflow is considered negligible based on the secondary sources that confirmed the absence of lake water geochemical mixing outside of the basin. Evaporation is estimated using Penman's, Meyer's and Thornwaite's methods to compare the mass balance and energy balance approaches. Meteorological data, satellite images and temperature perturbation simulations from Global Historical Climate Network of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration are employed for estimation of evaporation input parameters. The difference of the inflow and Outflow was taken as storage in depth and compared with the measured water level fluctuations. The study has shown that the monthly and annually calculated lake level replicates the observed values with root mean square error value of 0. 17 and 0. 15 in, respectively.

Evaluation of bias-correction methods for ensemble streamflow volume forecasts	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Ensemble prediction systems are used operationally to make probabilistic streamflow forecasts for seasonal time scales. However, hydrological models used for ensemble streamflow prediction often have simulation biases that degrade forecast quality and limit the operational usefulness of the forecasts. This study evaluates three bias-correction methods for ensemble streamflow volume forecasts. All three adjust the ensemble traces using a transformation derived with simulated and observed flows from a historical simulation. The quality of probabilistic forecasts issued when using the three bias-correction methods is evaluated using a distributions-oriented verification approach. Comparisons are made of retrospective forecasts of monthly flow volumes for a north-central United States basin (Des Moines River, Iowa), issued sequentially for each month over a 48-year record. The results show that all three bias-correction methods significantly improve forecast quality by eliminating unconditional biases and enhancing the potential skill. Still, subtle differences in the attributes of the bias-corrected forecasts have important implications for their use in operational decision-making. Diagnostic verification distinguishes these attributes in a context meaningful for decision-making, providing criteria to choose among bias-correction methods with comparable skill.

Here, we report an invertebrate trace fossil association from the largest and best-exposed Permian (Cisuralian) supervolcano in Europe, the Bolzano Supervolcano. The fossil association is dominated by abundant trace fossils that are unusually straight, i.e., their curvature is zero along the entire preserved length. The trace fossils are attributed to Planolites and Palaeophycus and they form a bioturbated texture (ichnofabric) with a characteristically high bioturbation intensity (percent bioturbated>90%). U-shaped (Arenicolites) and concentrically-lined (Cylindrichnus) burrows are minor components of the ichnofabric. The characteristics of the trace fossil association suggest substrate colonization by r-strategic organisms during periods of minor volcanic activity. In these periods of stasis, the volcanic rocks were eroded by seasonal streams, which provided suitable softground substrates for the infauna. Insects are regarded as the most plausible tracemakers of the straight burrows. Similar ichnofabrics are found in other continental volcanoclastic sites, suggesting that ichnofabrics dominated by straight burrows may represent an ichnological proxy of brief windows for colonization in volcanically influenced freshwater environments. Generative artificial intelligence has been used to graphically reconstitute the tiering pattern and the palaeoenvironment. As such, this study provides the first application of AI to the graphic representation of a bioturbated palaeoenvironment.					; Baucon, Andrea/KCY-0773-2024	Baucon, Andrea/0000-0001-8207-4860; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 15	2024	638								112027	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112027		JAN 2024											WOS:001171194500001

Environmental characteristics, landscape history and pressures on three coastal lagoons in the Southern Mediterranean Region: Merja Zerga (Morocco), Ghar El Melh (Tunisia) and Lake Manzala (Egypt)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Three North African coastal lagoons were selected as primary sites for integrated ecological and hydrological monitoring and modelling as part of the MELMARINA Project (see Flower & Thompson, 2009). The three sites, Merja Zerga (13.2 km(2), Morocco), Ghar El Melh (35.6 km(2), Tunisia) and Lake Manzala (c. 700 km(2), Egypt), are permanent water bodies with at least one well-defined connection with the sea. This article provides an account of each lagoon's physical characteristics and recent development including the impacts of human activities. The two sites on the Mediterranean (Ghar El Melh and Lake Manzala) are characterised by small tidally driven variations in water level whilst Merga Zerga, on the Atlantic coast, experiences large tidally induced water level variations and so contains large inter-tidal environments. All the three lagoons receive freshwater inflows from their landward margins, varying in magnitude, seasonality and ecological significance. Freshwater inflows from drains strongly influence ecological conditions within Lake Manzala. All the three lagoons have significant biodiversity interest, especially for resident and migratory birds as well as fish, and support local human populations. Each lagoon experienced significant changes during the twentieth century possibly affecting declines in biodiversity value. These largely resulted from agricultural expansion and intensification and include reclamation and hydrological modifications which have both decreased freshwater inflows due to upstream diversions (Merja Zerga and Ghar El Melh) and increased the influx of freshwater through the return of irrigation drainage (Merja Zerga and Lake Manzala). All three sites experienced nutrient enrichment due to agricultural runoff and discharge of domestic wastewater. Industrial waste discharge is a particular, but not exclusive, problem for Lake Manzala. Problems of water quantity and quality will increase through the twenty-first century with increasing demands for water while effects of climate change will enhance freshwater scarcity. Conflicts between human and environmental uses of water will increase and unless improvements in water use efficiency and wastewater treatment can be brought about wetlands including coastal lagoons are likely to suffer further loss and degradation. These problems will be compounded by sea level rise.					; Thompson, Julian/A-4781-2010	Thompson, Julian/0000-0002-8927-6462; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2009	622						15	43		10.1007/s10750-008-9676-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9676-6													WOS:000262826800003

In this study, we used high-precision elevation data for the interval from 2003-2009 measured by the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) on board the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) to assess annual and seasonal water level variations of Hulun Lake. The altimetry data of 32 satellite tracks were processed using the RANdom SAmple Consensus algorithm (RANSAC) to eliminate elevation outliers, and subsequently the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to delineate the area of the lake. From 2003-2009, the shoreline of Hulun Lake retreated westwards, which was especially notable in the southern part of the lake. There was only a small decrease in water level, from 530.72 m to 529.22 m during 2003-2009, an average rate of 0.08 m/yr. The area of the lake decreased at a rate of 49.52 km(2)/yr, which was mainly the result of the shallow bathymetry in the southern part of the basin. The decrease in area was initially rapid, then much slower, and finally rapid again. Generally, the lake extent and water level decreased due to higher temperatures, intense evaporation, low precipitation, and decreasing runoff. And their fluctuations were caused by a decrease in intraannual temperature, evaporation, and a slight increase in precipitation. Overall, a combination of factors related to climate change were responsible for the variations of the water level of Hulun Lake during the study interval. The results improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on Hulun Lake and may facilitate the formulation of response strategies.					li, chunlan/IUP-7784-2023														2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2018	12	2					420	430		10.1007/s11707-017-0666-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-017-0666-8													WOS:000432334400014

The non-parametric seasonal Mann-Kendall test was conducted to identify the trends of DOC and its potential drivers (e.g., temperature, runoff, atmospheric acid deposition and stream water chemistry). The monthly tributaries and water surface DOC concentrations in Fei-Tsui Reservoir had showed strong temporal and seasonal variability. The sulfate (SO4) concentration had exhibited statistically significant decreasing trend over a period of 16 years. The decreasing trends of anions (SO4 and NO3) and base cations (Ca and Mg) as well as increasing trends of pH and acidification index (ACI) in Fei-Tsui Reservoir and streams indicated recovery from acidification. However, there was no significant annual trend in DOC concentration of Fei-Tsui Reservoir and streams. Significant positive correlation was obtained between DOC and trophic state index of Fei-Tsui Reservoir. The results suggested that DOC concentration at the water surface of Fei-Tsui Reservoir was mainly driven by the re-oligotrophication and temperature effects rather than a decrease in atmospheric sulfur deposition. Stream DOC concentration was largely determined by the temporal variability in temperature and rainfall. We concluded that climatic and hydrological factors are the dominant drivers for stream DOC dynamics in the study.

The section consists mainly of mudstones, shales and layers of volcanic ash. The mudstones and shales are composed of siliciclastic and organic-rich laminae. Most of the laminations are varves that record seasonal climatic changes. Varve thickness measurements show that the sedimentation rate for the majority of the mudstones and shales was 0.2-0.7 mm/year. Quiet, anoxic lacustrine bottom waters were critical for the preservation of the laminations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Convincing archaeological evidence for pre-Clovis groups is lacking. Paleoindian artifacts including Clovis and Fishtail fluted projectile points have been found at several localities, but at only one site (Vampiros-1) in buried and radiocarbon-dated deposits (similar to 11,500-similar to 9000 BP). Close similarities between Clovis point reduction sequences at two Panamanian quarry-workshops to those of early US Clovis sites vouch for temporal proximity and suggest rapid movement of Clovis bands through Central America, 11,050-10,800 BP. Vampiros-1 and other rock-shelters were occupied during the early Holocene (10,000-7000 BP) when climate became warmer and wetter. Un-fluted bifacial projectile points were made until similar to 7000 BP. Widespread grinding stones and carbonized tree fruits announce a mixed economy at the beginning of the Holocene. Cultivated leren, arrowroot, squash and bottle gourd appeared by 8000 BP. There are no indicators of human activities at Lake La Yeguada (650 m asl), 14,000-11,150 BP, nor at Vampiros-1, 16,000-11,500 BP. Pre-Clovis populations were probably bound to the now-drowned Pacific coast. Intense burning and deforestation commenced at La Yeguada similar to 11,050 BP coevally with Clovis. Human impacts were thenceforth continuous. Swidden farming had largely removed forest cover by 7000 BP across seasonally arid Central Pacific Panama. Lake sediment data from forested areas with less seasonal climates on the Caribbean and Pacific watersheds indicate moderate human interference before 7000 BP. The mtDNA history of modern Panamanians confirms Native American continuity from before 10,000 BP and provides support for the Pacific route of initial dispersal into South America.

Phosphorus loading and ecological impacts from agricultural tile drains in a west Michigan watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phosphorus (P) loading from nonpoint sources is often implicated as a contributing factor to the proliferation of algal blooms in freshwater ecosystems. However, the influence of subsurface tile drains as a source of P, especially in agricultural areas, has received limited attention. We examined the importance of tile drain effluent in the Macatawa Watershed; this watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture and drains into hypereutrophic Lake Macatawa, which connects to Lake Michigan. Our objectives were twofold: 1) assess the importance of tile drain effluent as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed by measuring tile drain P concentrations spatially and temporally over a one-year period; and 2) assess the ability of tile drain effluent to stimulate algal blooms using bioassays with natural phytoplankton communities. During March 2015-February 2016, P concentrations varied significantly among sample sites (SRP: <0.005 to 0.447 mg/L; TP: 0.010 to 0.560 mg/L), and the highest P loads occurred during the non-growing season. Annual SRP yields from the tile drain sample sites ranged from 0.002 kg/ha to 0.248 kg/ha, and annual TP yields ranged from 0.003 kg/ha to 0.322 kg/ha. SRP, on average, accounted for 60% of TP, and the SRP:TP ratio measured at the tile drain outlets was positively correlated with area drained by the tile system. Algal bioassays failed to find a positive relationship between chlorophyll a and tile drain SRP; algal community structure was dominated by diatoms, not by cyanobacteria, as expected.

Underestimation of microzooplankton is a macro problem: One size fits all zooplankton sampling needs alterations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Microzooplankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, and dreissenid veligers) are an important but overlooked part of zooplankton communities and aquatic food webs, particularly in the Great Lakes. Most studies that do include microzooplankton data are not describing the full picture due to inappropriate sampling methodology. We compared the traditional macrozooplankton sampling method (64-mu m mesh plankton net) to a microzooplankton method using a 20-mu m mesh screen in various habitats in Lake Michigan. The macrozooplankton method significantly underestimated total rotifer density by an order of magnitude, veliger density by nearly an order of magnitude, and copepod nauplii density by threefold. Combining macrozooplankton method estimates for cladocerans and copepods with estimates of rotifer, nauplii, and veligers from the microzooplankton method samples showed rotifers contributed 51% of total mean zooplankton biomass, refuting the past notion that rotifers contribute little to overall zooplankton biomass. Our study demonstrates that the traditional one-size fits all sampling approach used in the majority of zooplanlcton monitoring studies in the Great Lakes significantly underestimates microzooplankton abundance and its relative importance. Biassed information on Great Lakes zoo plankton community composition has ramifications beyond a basic understanding of Great Lakes food webs. The lack of accurate data on microzooplankton abundance suggests that prey resources available to Asian carp in Lake Michigan have been greatly underestimated along with the likelihood these invasive species could become established. The dual sampling approach must become the norm rather than the exception for zooplankton research in the Great Lakes and other freshwater systems.

K.; Datta, Saugata			Diverse sedimentary organic matter within the river-aquifer interface drives arsenic mobility along the Meghna River Corridor in Bangladesh	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												In alluvial aquifers with near-neutral pH and high dissolved arsenic (As) concentrations, the presence and character of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) regulates As mobility by serving as an energetically variable source of electrons for redox reactions or forming As-Fe-OM complexes. Near tidally and seasonally fluctuating rivers, the hyporheic zone (HZ), which embodies the mixing zone between oxic river water and anoxic shallow groundwater, may precipitate (or dissolve) iron (Fe)-oxides which sequester (or mobilize) As. To understand what is driving the mobilization of As within a shallow aquifer and riverbank sands adjacent to the tidally fluctuating Meghna River, we characterized the chemical reactivity of SOM from the sands, and a silt and clay layer, underlying the HZ and aquifer, respectively. Dissolved As (50-500 mu g/L) and Fe (1-40 mg/L) concentrations increase with depth within the shallow aquifer. Similar vertical As and Fe concentration gradients were observed within the riverbank sands where concentrations of the products of reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides increase with proximity to the silt layer. Compared to all other sediments, the SOM in the clay aquitard contains older, more recalcitrant, terrestrially-derived material with high proportions of aromatic carboxylate functional groups. The shallow silt layer contains fresher SOM with higher proportions of amides and more labile polysaccharide moieties. The SOM in both the riverbank and aquifer is terrestrially-derived and humic-like. The labile SOM from the silt layer drives the microbially mediated reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe-oxides in the HZ. In contrast, the carboxylate-rich SOM from the clay aquitard maintains dissolved As concentrations at the base of the aquifer by complexing with soluble As and Fe. This highlights that SOM-rich fine (silt or clay) layers in the Bengal basin drive As and Fe mobility, however, the specific processes mobilizing As and Fe depend on the lability of the SOM.

MCs were quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The total content of MCs in water samples (2.8 +/- 5.6 mu g L-1) and in O. bonariensis muscle (3.9 +/- 2.2 mu g kg(-1)) never surpassed guidelines values recommended by WHO for either recreational use of water or fish consumption. The total content of MCs in O. bonariensis liver was 33.6 +/- 37.2 mu g kg(-1). However, we observed both spatial and temporal changes in MC profile, suggesting the need of an intensive monitoring program at such lake to ensure the health of people living in its surrounding. We observed a significant correlation between the content of total and dissolved MC in water and the concentration of these toxins in liver, showing the probable uptake of dissolved MC by O. bonariensis. MC-RR was the dominant variant in water samples, followed by MC-LA and MC-LR. MC-YR was always present in water samples, but in the lowest concentrations of the congeners measured. MC content in liver in O. bonariensis was ten-fold higher than the corresponding content in fish muscle. However, MCs were present in muscle of O. bonariensis during both wet and dry season, while we could not detect MCs in liver during the dry season. These results demonstrate that MC accumulation in liver and muscle of O. bonariensis occurred with different profiles. Moreover, different uptake, tissue distribution and excretion pathways may occur between diverse MC variants. For instance, during the dry season, an increase in the relative percentage of MC-LR in water samples was accompanied with an augmentation in the relative percentage of this toxin in muscle of O. bonariensis. Conversely, a rise in the relative percentage of MC-LA in water samples during the dry season did not impact on the distribution of this toxin in fish muscle. These results suggest the need of further studies on dynamics of different variants of MC to pursuit a complete evaluation of human health risk associated to MC occurrence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A stable isotope study of microbial dolomite formation in the Coorong Region, South Australia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The Coorong Region of South Australia is a classic location for the study of modem dolomite formation. A number of ephemeral lakes here contain dolomite, whilst other lakes in close proximity, contain aragonite with minor magnesite. Our previous field and experimental work has revealed that sulphate-reducing bacteria play a key role in overcoming kinetic inhibitors to dolomite formation in this area. We here use a combination of oxygen, carbon and sulphur isotopes to help to further constrain the processes leading to dolomite precipitation in modem hypersaline environments. We report isotopic data from four dolomite and three aragonite containing lakes. delta S-34 data for dissolved lake- and porewater sulphates reveal S-34 enrichment of residual sulphate in all seven lakes, consistent with bulk closed system microbial fractionation by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Calculations using temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation factors between dolomite and the solution from which it precipitated are consistent with a strong microbial component to carbonate precipitation in these lakes. A comparison of delta O-18 data from dolomite and aragonite sediment and from their associated lakewaters indicates seasonal mineral precipitation occurs late in the evaporative cycle of the lakes within a yoghurt-like saturated mud horizon coincident with the zone of sulphate reduction. Surprisingly, delta C-13 data from the carbonates do not show the characteristic wide range of values often associated with 'organogenic' carbonates, but instead show that these bacterially-mediated precipitates incorporate carbon primarily from the inorganic, lakewater reservoir, partially diluted by an organic component. A'Coorong type' microbial model of dolomite formation may be particularly applicable to, for example, Precambrian sedimentary dolomites where benthic microbial communities, which are today restricted to extreme environments, dominated the shallow-marine ecosystem prior to the emergence of Metazoa.

However, the long-term effects and retention impacts of the government's mandatory intervention on the reservoir water quality are unknown. To determine the reservoir water quality, we employed statistical methods along with the mathematical model to investigate the internal relationship since the construction of the reservoir. We applied seasonal trend decomposition using loess (STL) to explore the long-term and seasonality trend of monthly total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP). To separate the impact of upstream water quality changes from cage culture on reservoir water quality, we employed generalized additive models (GAMs). We created a model, the LAKE2K model, to investigate the internal sources of the sediment that accumulated during the aquaculture period and its retardant effect. The results revealed that the concentration of upstream TN was more affected by non-point sources than by TP. The long-term policy of encouraging aquaculture has greatly contributed to the increase in the reservoir TP concentration rather than an increase in TN; the prohibition of cage aquaculture has resulted in a sharp drop in TP. After the ban, the sediment became the main source of TP. We suspect that the TP concentration of the reservoir and sediment will decrease gradually until a new equilibrium is reached within 10 years. This study offers lake managers an opportunity to increase their insight into the interaction of management measures with water quality and provides valuable information for the natural recovery of the eutrophic system.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of the bacterial microbiota on lacustrine Cladophora glomerata (Chlorophyta)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The branched periphytic green alga Cladophora glomerata, often abundant in nearshore waters of lakes and rivers worldwide, plays important ecosystem roles, some mediated by epibiotic microbiota that benefit from host-provided surface, organic C, and O-2. Previous microscopy and high-throughput sequencing studies have indicated surprising epibiont taxonomic and functional diversity, but have not included adequate consideration of sample replication or the potential for spatial and temporal variation. Here, we report the results of 16S rRNA amplicon-based phylum-to-genus taxonomic analysis of Cladophora-associated bacterial epibiota sampled in replicate from three microsites and at six times during the open-water season of 2014, from the same lake locale (Picnic Point, Lake Mendota, Dane Co., WI, USA) explored by high-throughput sequencing studies in two previous years. Statistical methods were used to test null hypotheses that the bacterial community: (i) is homogeneous across microsites tested, and (ii) does not change over the course of a growth season or among successive years. Results indicated a dynamic microbial community that is more strongly influenced by sampling day during the growth season than by microsite variation. A surprising diversity of bacterial genera known to be associated with the key function of methane-oxidation(methanotrophy), including relatively high-abundance of Crenothrix, Methylomonas, Methylovulum, and Methylocaldum-showed intraseasonal and interannual variability possibly related to temperature differences, and microsite preferences possibly related to variation in methane abundance. By contrast, a core assemblage of bacterial genera seems to persist over a growth season and from year to year, possibly transmitted by a persistent attached host resting stage.

Interspecies comparison of selected pollution biomarkers in dreissenid spp. inhabiting pristine and moderately polluted sites	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Stress biomarkers, which can outline impacts of contaminants in aquatic biota at the biochemical level, are increasingly used as early warning tools in environmental monitoring. Reliable biomarker based assessment schemes, however, request appropriate knowledge of baseline levels of selected endpoints, and the potential influence of a range of natural influencing factors (both abiotic and biotic) as well. In this study, we examined the interspecies variability of various biomarkers (metallothioneins (MT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNA_sb), vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg)) in Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis inhabiting either pristine- or moderately impacted sites of Lake Balaton (Hungary). Levels of all biomarkers considered revealed low interspecies variability in the two dreissenid species at all sampling sites, with consistently higher (but statistically insignificant) values in Dreissena polymorpha. Levels of all biomarkers varied within the two investigated seasons, with significant influence of the reproduction cycle particularly on the levels of metallothioneins and vitellogenin-like proteins. Each biomarker considered was elevated by October, with significantly higher values in the mussels inhabiting harbours. Insignificant spatial and temporal variability in the general health indicators (condition index, total protein content) of dreissenids was observed, which, in parallel with evident rise in biomarker levels, apparently suggest that the anthropogenic impactsin harbours affect mussel fitness yet at sub organismal level. Our data might serve useful basis for future environmental monitoring surveys, especially in habitats where the progressive replacement of Dreissena polymorpha by Dreissena bugensis is taking place, as the interspecies variability in susceptibility to chemical stress of the two species is well comparable.

Crevasse-splay and associated depositional environments of the hominin-bearing lower Okote Member, Koobi Fora Formation (Plio-Pleistocene), Kenya	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												The Okote Member from the northeast Turkana Basin of Kenya represents an exceptionally good archive of Early Pleistocene archaeological and fossil sites. Field study of the lower Okote Member and underlying deposits was conducted in detail at two sets of outcrops (500 to 1000m long) separated by some 22km of modern landscape. The examined sections (10 to 15m thick) preserve two facies: interbedded sandstones, tuffs and mudstones (crevasse splay) and ribbon-like bodies of sandstone/tuff (crevasse channel). Mudstones are overprinted with small carbonate nodules and sparse slickensides that are interpreted as evidence of weak soil development after the cessation of suspension deposition in a floodplain. The immaturity of the ancient soils implies that sediment accumulation was fairly rapid, yet the nodules and slickensides indicate seasonal contrasts in moisture. Episodically rapid sedimentation is suggested by the types of depositional environments and their structures, and indications of soft-sediment deformation. Crevassing may have been influenced by rivers that flooded in response to monsoonal rainfall variations and the voluminous influx of fluvially reworked volcaniclastics to the basin. A well-developed palaeosol directly underlying the lower Okote Member suggests that the deposits accumulated following a significant depositional hiatus. This basal contact, in addition to the apparent pervasiveness and penecontemporaneousness of the sedimentary facies, resembles a crevasse-splay system deposited by a sub-delta lobe or river avulsion. A paucity of lacustrine/deltaic indicators might indicate that the studied deposits correspond better with an avulsion origin. Sedimentation rates calculated from prior radiometric dating of tuffs tend to overestimate the timeframe of accumulation for individual strata of the lower Okote Member. Many appear to have formed on the order of 10(0) to 10(3)years, as suggested by facies, palaeosols and observations of modern crevasse splays. This cautions against using sedimentation rates alone to infer how much time a stratum preserving fossil/archaeological information represents.

As the main performers of biogeochemical cycles, microorganisms affect the ecological stability of the lake. To study the structural characteristics of the microbial community in Yangcheng Lake and rivers entering Yangcheng Lake and the response relationship with environmental factors, the microbial community was categorized based on the contour of Yangcheng Lake, the major rivers entering Yangcheng Lake, and the pollution sources. The distribution characteristics of seven physicochemical indices were analyzed, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN/TP). Characterization of microbial community structure based on 16S rRNA high-flux sequencing technology and ANOSIM analysis were used to explore the differences in the relative abundance of microorganisms at each sampling point in the lake and rivers, and redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to analyze the relationship between the microbial community and physicochemical factors. The results showed that the dominant phyla, genera of microorganisms, and the total number of OTUs in the lake and rivers were similar. The dominant phyla included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia; the dominant genera included the hgcI clade, CL500-29 marine group, Microcystis PCC-7914, Chloroplast_norank, Clade III_norank, and Flavobacterium. ANOSIM analyses revealed that the microbial community of Yangcheng Lake exhibited an association with geographical space, while the microbial community in the rivers that was linked to the type of pollution source. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), and pH were significantly correlated with the dominant phyla in Yangcheng Lake (p < 0.05), while total nitrogen (TN), water temperature(WT), and the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN/TP) were significantly related with the dominant genera in Yangcheng Lake (p < 0.05). Total nitrogen (TN) was also significantly linked to the dominant phyla and genera of the tributaries (p < 0.05). Despite the structural similarities in microbial communities between Yangcheng Lake and its inflowing rivers, environmental factors demonstrated significant associations with these communities, providing crucial data support for pollution prevention and the ecological restoration of Yangcheng Lake.					xu, zhipeng/M-7708-2019; Wang, Jinhui/GSD-9243-2022; Wu, Dan/AEQ-0432-2022														0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2024	31	6					9565	9581		10.1007/s11356-023-31810-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31810-z		JAN 2024						38191738					WOS:001137899300001

Diet of an Assemblage of Four Species of Turtles (Podocnemis) in the Rio Uatuma, Amazonas, Brazil	COPEIA												The structure and functioning of freshwater turtle communities remain understudied topics, especially in tropical regions where biodiversity is higher. The objective of our study was to compare the diets of Podocnemis erythrocephala, P. expansa, P. sextuberculata, and P. unifilis living in syntopy in Amazonas, Brazil. We tested for qualitative and quantitative variations in the way different species used the same available food resources. We collected fresh stomach flushings from all turtles captured in trammel nets in three lakes in 2012. Sampling was conducted in the four distinct tropical seasons: beginning of rainy season (rising water), peak of rainy season (rapidly rising water), end of rainy season (highest flooded forest water level), and dry season (when water levels were receding). We tested the hypothesis that different food items are available in different quantities at different times of the year due to the seasonality of fruiting trees and other plants in response to the wet and dry conditions. We examined whether food items consumed were related to turtle body size and if there was feeding niche overlap among species. Podocnemis sextuberculata consumed the least amount of food by volume, while P. expansa consumed the highest diversity of food items. All four species are primarily herbivorous, and their diets were composed mainly of fruits and seeds (85.4% mean proportion by volume). Genipa americana (Rubiaceae) was most important in the diet of all species, except in P. sextuberculata. We found some evidence of seasonal differences in the consumption of some plant species. Body size did not influence qualitative (diversity of food items eaten) or quantitative variation of food items (volume), except in P. erythrocephala for which we detected a significant linear relationship between carapace length and the volume of stomach contents. The highest food niche overlap was between P. expansa and P. unifills, and the lowest niche overlap was between P. erythrocephala and P. sextuberculata. Turtles tended to partition food resources more in areas that had more species feeding in syntopy than in areas with fewer syntopic species.

A method was first proposed to quantitatively explore the mechanisms driving water quality evolution, in which the weights of horizontal boundary input, self-purification, vertical atmospheric deposition and sediment release could be determined. A two-dimensional water environment model for Poyang Lake was developed in the framework of the Finite Volume Method and calibrated against the field investigated data. Four typical months in a common-water year were determined for numerical experiments to investigate the temporal and spatial water quality driving mechanisms in Poyang Lake. The results suggested that boundary input and self-purification have the greatest effect on dominating the water quality in Poyang Lake, followed by atmospheric deposition and sediment release. The driving weights of these four factors are 57.2%, 26.5%, 9.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. However, the impact on lake water quality of external water quality, aquatic ecosystem structure, precipitation distribution, and meteorological conditions, which are attributed to the disparities in geographical situation, varied significantly with seasons and locations.																			1606-9749	1607-0798				MAR	2020	20	2					700	711		10.2166/ws.2019.203	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2019.203													WOS:000538126000031

The major taphonomic processes that control the preservation of insects in fossil resins (amber and copal) are different, but can be considered under the same headings - biological: presence of resin producers, size and behaviour of insects; environmental: latitude, climate, seasonality, resin viscosity, effects of storms and fires, soil composition; and diagenetic: resin composition, insect dehydration, pressure, carbonisation, thermal maturation, reworking, oxidation. These taphonomic processes are geographically and temporally restricted, and generate biases in the fossil record. Nevertheless, where insects occur they may be abundant and very diverse. Taphonomic processes may impact on phylogenetic and palaeobiogeographic studies, in determining the timing of the origin and extinction of insect groups, and in identifying radiations and major extinctions. Taphonomic studies are an essential prerequisite to the reconstruction of fossil insect assemblages, to interpreting the sedimentary and environmental conditions where insects lived and died, and to the investigation of interactions between insects and other organisms.

However, most current studies are focused on the aerial shoots, and less attention has been paid to the functions of the roots. In order to evaluate the effects of water level fluctuations (WLFs) on root architectural and morphological traits of plants in lakeshore areas, field investigations were conducted seasonally in three subtropical floodplain lakes with different types of WLFs. The results showed that both the pH and moisture contents of the soils were significantly different in all seasons among the three lakes, while the total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the soils only showed significant differences in certain seasons. Significant differences were also found in the two architectural trait parameters (root length density and root branching number) and three morphological trait parameters (root tissue density, root surface area, and root volume), all of which (except for root tissue density) were highest in the Dahuchi lake that experiences intermittent WLFs, and lowest in the Chaohu Lake with reservoir-like WLFs. With increasing lakeshore elevation gradients, we found that root length density, root branching number, root surface area, and root volume in the three lakes changed significantly, and all these root trait parameters increased first and then decreased. However, no significant differences were found for the above four root traits in the three lakes over the different seasons. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that both the hydrological and physicochemical factors were strongly correlated with the architectural and morphological root trait parameters, and the duration of submergence (duration) was the most important factor, judging from the correlation coefficients (R). The results of stepwise multiple regression further indicated the duration was the key factor affecting plant root traits. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that the WLFs in reservoir-like lakes should be changed in order to improve the ecological functions of the lakeshore.

Quantification of upland thermokarst features with high resolution remote sensing	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate-induced changes to permafrost are altering high latitude landscapes in ways that could increase the vulnerability of the vast soil carbon pools of the region. Permafrost thaw is temporally dynamic and spatially heterogeneous because, in addition to the thickening of the active layer, localized thermokarst features form when ice-rich permafrost thaws and the ground subsides. Thermokarst produces a diversity of landforms and alters the physical environment in dynamic ways. To estimate potential changes to the carbon cycle it is imperative to quantify the size and distribution of thermokarst landforms. By performing a supervised classification on a high resolution IKONOS image, we detected and mapped small, irregular thermokarst features occurring within an upland watershed in discontinuous permafrost of Interior Alaska. We found that 12% of the Eight Mile Lake (EML) watershed has undergone thermokarst, predominantly in valleys where tussock tundra resides. About 35% of the 3.7 km(2) tussock tundra class has likely transitioned to thermokarst. These landscape level changes created by permafrost thaw at EML have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycling because thermokarst features are forming in carbon-rich areas and are altering the hydrology in ways that increase seasonal thawing of the soil.

Mid Cenozoic freshwater wetlands of the Sunda region	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Sunda region was the scene of widespread rifting during the mid-Cenozoic, resulting in the development of numerous large lake-filled rifts, analogous in scale to the rift valley system of East Africa. The Tonle Sap in Cambodia forms the closest modern analogue for these lakes in the Southeast Asian region. Many of the palaeolakes were long lived, continuing uninterrupted as open lakes for several millions of years during the Oligocene. Smaller rift systems infilled with fluvial sediments, but the majority remained as lakes, and with Late Oligocene subsidence, were transformed by brackish, and in the earliest Miocene, by marine incursion, into large inland seas. These seas reached their greatest extent at the time of the mid Miocene thermal maximum. This paper describes the development and eventual demise of these lakes following marine transgression, and, based on their rich content of pollen and spores, illustrates the variety of fresh and brackish water swamp communities which developed around their margins. The marginal swamps can be divided into: i) seasonally inundated swamps, mainly during the Oligocene, characterised by Barringtonia, Lagerstroemia and grasses/sedges; ii) fern swamps from the Late Oligocene onward; iii) alluvial swamps, often characterised by Pandanus; and iv) peat swamps. The latter can be differentiated into kerapah peat swamps, first occurring during the Oligocene, and basinal peat swamps, becoming widespread from the Early Miocene onward.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72			2			18	35		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.s2.e3	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.s2.e3													WOS:000329202200003

In this study, we showed that CL500-11 is also dominant in the oxygenated hypolimnion of Lake Biwa (Japan) and followed its spatiotemporal succession using fluorescent in situ hybridization. CL500-11 cells were almost absent [< 1% of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained cells] at the beginning of the stratification period, dominated (> 10% of DAPI-stained cells; maximum = 16.5%) in the hypolimnion during the stratification period, and decreased to below the detection limit with the collapse of the thermocline. This pattern was observed over two annual cycles. A longitudinal assessment also showed that CL500-11 was the dominant bacterium in the hypolimnion over the whole lake, but was generally undetectable in the stratified epilimnion. These data suggest that CL500-11 is acclimated to the oxygenated hypolimnion and is a potentially important component of the pelagic biogeochemical cycling of the lake. A comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that almost all CL500-11 sequences previously deposited in the database were detected from hypolimnion or holomictic water in deep oxic freshwater lakes, suggesting that the bacteria may form one of the common lineages residing in an aerobic hypolimnetic niche.

Nutrient loadings from urban catchments under climate change scenarios: Case studies in Stockholm, Sweden	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenic nutrient emissions and associated eutrophication of urban lakes are a global problem. Future changes in temperature and precipitation may influence nutrient loadings in lake catchments. A coupling method, where the Generalized Watershed Loading Functions method was tested in combination with source quantification in a Substance Flow Analysis structure, was suggested to investigate diffuse nutrient sources and pathways and climate change effects on the loadings to streamflow in urban catchments. This method may, with an acceptable level of uncertainty, be applied to urban catchments for first-hand estimations of nutrient loadings in the projected future and to highlight the need for further study andmonitoring. Five lake catchments in Stockholm, Sweden (Racksta Trask, Judarn, Trekanten, Langsjon and Laduviken) were employed as case studies and potential climate change effects were explored by comparing loading scenarios in two periods (2000-2009 and 2021-2030). For the selected cases, the dominant diffuse sources of nutrients to urban streamflow were found to be background atmospheric concentration and vehicular traffic. The major pathways of the nitrogen loading were suggested to be from both developed areas and natural areas in the control period, while phosphorus was indicated to be largely transported through surface runoff from natural areas. Furthermore, for nitrogen, a modest redistribution of loadings from surface runoff and stormwater between seasons and an increase in the annual loading were suggested for the projected future climate scenarios as compared to the control period. The model was, due to poor monitoring data availability, only able to set an upper limit to nutrient transport by groundwater both in the control period and the future scenarios. However, for nitrogen, groundwater appeared to be the pathway most sensitive to climate change, with a considerable increase and seasonal redistribution of loadings. For phosphorus, loadings by different pathways were apparently less sensitive to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Norf, H; Arndt, H; Weitere, M				Norf, Helge; Arndt, Hartmut; Weitere, Markus			Responses of Biofilm-Dwelling Ciliate Communities to Planktonic and Benthic Resource Enrichment	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Four experiments covering different seasons were performed to test the impact of increased benthic and planktonic resource availability on the structure of biofilm-dwelling ciliate communities which were cultivated in river bypass systems. The growth of benthic bacteria was stimulated by the addition of dissolved organic carbon. The enrichment of the planktonic resource was achieved by supplementation with suspended bacteria. It was shown that both resource enrichments can differentially influence abundance and taxonomic structure of ciliate communities. Furthermore, both resources can influence different stages during biofilm colonization. Increased benthic bacterial growth mainly resulted in both an accumulation of primarily grazing-resistant bacterial filaments and in an increase in the number of vagile heterotrophic flagellates. This can stimulate nanophagous ciliates (feeding on flagellates) in addition to the direct stimulation of bacteriovorous ciliates. The effects of the planktonic bacteria enrichments were twofold: They could have been utilized either directly by suspension-feeding ciliates or indirectly through an enhanced growth of suspension-feeding attached heterotrophic flagellates, which were then in turn grazed upon by ciliates. The magnitude of responses of the total ciliate abundance to the two resource enrichments further depended on the background conditions, thereby showing temporarily variable limitations of these resources. Furthermore, the particular taxonomic groups stimulated by one resource type sometimes differed between the experiments, an observation which demonstrates that the response depends on different environmental factors and is not easily predictable based simply on resource type. Taken together, our results emphasize the need of a differentiated view on the effects of resources on complex biofilm-dwelling consumer communities with respect to both the origin of carbon source as well as the particular environmental conditions.

This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of heavy metals in urban rivers of Xi'an, China. Their distribution characteristics and sources as well their pollution levels and health risks were assessed. The findings revealed that influenced by human activities, the heavy metal content in sediments (mg<middle dot>kg(-1) dry weight) in wet season was ranked as follows: Cr (73.09) > Zn (63.73) > Pb (40.31) > Ni (31.52) > Cu (24.86) > As (6.83); in the dry season: Zn (94.07) > Cr (69.59) > Cu (34.24) > Ni (33.60) > Pb (32.87) > As (7.60). Moreover, 32 fish samples from six species indicated an average metal content trend (mg<middle dot>kg(-1) wet weight) of Zn (8.70) > Cr (0.57) > Pb (0.28) > Ni (0.27) > Cu (0.24) > As (0.05). The potential ecological risk indices for sediment heavy metal concentrations in both seasons were well below the thresholds, which indicates that the aquatic environment is in safe level. The analysis of the potential ecological risk of sediment heavy metal concentrations indicates that the aquatic environment is safe for the time being. Based on the estimated daily intake (EDI), target risk quotient (THQ), total target risk quotient (TTHQ), cancer risk (CR), total cancer risk (TCR), and the permissible safety limits set by the agencies, the consumption of the fish examined is safe for human health. However, the presence of Cr and As in wild fish should still be a concern for human health, especially for children. The cumulative effect of heavy metals and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) suggest that sediment and heavy metals in fish are closely related, with higher concentrations in fish living in the bottom layer of the water column than in other water layers, and increasing with increasing predator levels. Correlation analysis and PMF modeling identified and determined four comparable categories of potential sources, namely, (1) atmospheric deposition and traffic sources, (2) agricultural sources, (3) industrial sources, and (4) natural sources.

J	Wang, JW; Wu, W; Zhou, XD; Li, JY				Wang, Jiawei; Wu, Wei; Zhou, Xiaode; Li, Jiayuan			Carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure and emission from the river-reservoir system in the upper Yellow River, northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux between rivers and the atmosphere is an important part of the global carbon cycle. Reservoir development and environmental changes gradually transform rivers into river-reservoir systems. However, the current estimates of CO2 exchange flux at the water-air interface in river-reservoir systems, especially in ecologically fragile regions, are still largely uncertain. In this study, the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and exchange flux (FCO2) from river-reservoir systems in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (YeUR) were investigated using the CO2 SYS system and a boundary layer approach. The spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of the partial pressure of rho CO2 and FCO2 were revealed. Our results demonstrated that, driven by the freeze-thaw cycle of the permafrost active layer and the development of cascade reservoirs, the average rho CO2 in the two water periods was higher in the cascade reservoir section (CR) than in the source region section (SR) and higher in the flood period than in the dry period. Driven by water temperature stratification and light conditions, the rho CO2 of each reservoir in the CR exhibited seasonal variations along with water depth. The environmental factors TN, TP, T, DO, and DOC were the main influencing factors of rho CO2 distribution and could be used as predictors of rho CO2 in the dry period (R-2 =0.40 P < 0.01). In the dry period, the FCO2 in the SR was - 112.91 +/- 165.94 mmol/ (m(2).d), which was a sink of CO2, and the FCO2 in the CR was 131.02 +/- 156.77 mmol/(m(2).d), which was a source of CO2. In the flood period, the FCO2 in the SR was 686.54 +/- 624.33 mmol/(m(2).d), and the FCO2 in the CR was 466.10 +/- 366.67 mmol/(m(2).d). Both the SR and the CR were sinks of CO2. Our results contribute to the understanding of CO2 exchange in river-reservoir systems and carbon cycle processes.

Previous studies have found that low CO2 favors toxic strains, but how changing dissolved CO2 (CO2 [aq]) in water body influences the succession of toxic and non-toxic strains in Microcystis blooms remains uncertain. Here, we combined laboratory competition experiments, field observations, and a machine learning model to reveal the links between CO2 changes and the succession. Laboratory experiments showed that under low CO2 conditions (100-150 ppm), the toxic strains could make better use of CO2 (aq) and be dominant. The non-toxic strains demonstrated a growth advantage as CO2 concentration increased (400-1000 ppm). Field observations from June to November in Lake Taihu showed that the percentage of toxic strains increased as CO2 (aq) decreased. Machine learning highlighted links between the inorganic carbon concentration and the proportion of advantageous strains. Our findings provide new insights for cyanoHABs prediction and prevention.

Drivers of water quality in Afromontane-savanna rivers	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Although several studies have investigated the relationships between water quality in rivers and the types of land use within their catchments, many aspects of these relationships remain unclear in Afromontane-savanna rivers, especially the interactions between catchment land use, seasonality and stream size. Afromontane-savanna catchments present a unique situation where headwater regions and lowlands have experienced more dramatic land cover change, but mid-elevation regions remained rather natural. We examined the influence of seasonality, catchment land use and stream size, including their interactions, on water physico-chemistry, nutrients and major ions in the Afromontane-savanna Mara River in Kenya, using data collected from 2010 to 2018 at > 150 sampling sites in the Kenyan part of the river. We developed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to explore the influence of seasonality (dry and wet seasons), land use (forest, mixed, agriculture and grasslands), stream size (stream orders 1-7), and their interactions on river water quality. Water quality variables included physico-chemical measures (pH, dissolved oxygen [DO] concentration, temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids [TDS], turbidity, total suspended solids [TSS] and particulate organic matter [POM]), nutrients (NH+4NH4+, NO-3NO3-, total dissolved nitrogen [TDN], total nitrogen [TN], soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP], total phosphorus [TP] and dissolved organic carbon), and major ions (Cl-, F-,SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, HCO3- and Si). There were clear differences in average values of most water quality variables among land uses with sites in savanna grasslands having high levels of major ions, ammonium and P, while agricultural sites had higher dissolved fraction of N (except ammonium). Stream order was a poor predictor of water quality, and most parameters did not display any relationship (either linear or non-linear) with stream size. Our results can be used to efficiently enhance water quality by developing strategies for stream restoration and management based on the predomination type of land use in the catchments.					; Masese, Frank/C-1265-2010; Singer, Gabriel/JBR-8741-2023; Gettel, Gretchen/M-8983-2013	Singer, Gabriel/0000-0002-7389-9788; Gettel, Gretchen/0000-0002-9288-1583														2296-665X				OCT 12	2022	10								972153	10.3389/fenvs.2022.972153	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.972153													WOS:000876732100001

Studies were made bimonthly, from January to November, in a shallow macrophyte-dominated lake. The periphytic algal community was represented by chlorophytes, diatoms and cyanobacteria; diatoms showed the highest relative abundance on the macrophyte species during the study. Algal biomass was affected by the season, and in January the highest values were found on Stratiotes aloides L., Potamogeton lucens L., Myriophyllum spicatum L.; in July on Chara aculeolata Kutz. The lowest algal biomass, on most of the macrophytes studied, was found in September. Larvae of Dicrotendipes sp., Diplocladius cultriger Kieffer, Endochironomus albipennis gr., Endochironomus impar (Walker), Glyptotendipes sp. and Paratanytarsus austriacus Kieffer were dominant within the chironomid community. The spatial distribution of chironomids between macrophytes species was related to periphytic algae biomass and certain environmental variables (temperature, water transparency, biomass of chlorophytes and diatoms). Analysis of chironomid diet and the results of canonical correspondence analysis confirmed this relationship. The strongest chironomid-algae relationships were observed on S. aloides and P. lucens.

J	Paré, MC; Bedard-Haughn, A				Pare, Maxime C.; Bedard-Haughn, Angela			Landscape-scale N mineralization and greenhouse gas emissions in Canadian Cryosols	GEODERMA												Arctic soils store great amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) that are likely to be affected by future climate changes. Knowledge of the ability of the soil to mineralize nitrogen (N) and release greenhouse gases (GHG) at the landscape scale is critical to predict and model future effects of climate change on Arctic SOM. The objective of this study was to investigate how soil gross N mineralization and GHG emissions vary across landscapes and Arctic ecosystems. This study was conducted in three Arctic ecosystems: Sub-Arctic (Churchill, MB), Low-Arctic (Daring Lake, NWT), and High-Arctic (Truelove Lowlands, NU). The topography was divided into five landform units: 1) upper (Up), 2) back (Back), and 3) lower (Low) slopes for catena sites and 4) hummock and 5) interhummock for hummocky sites (i.e., hummock in Churchill and ice-wedge polygons in Truelove). All sites were sampled near the end of their growing seasons (i.e., from two to three weeks before plant senescence). Soil gross N mineralization was measured in situ using a N-15 dilution technique, whereas soil GHG emissions (N2O, CH4, and CO2) were measured in situ using a multicomponent Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer combined with an automated dark chamber. For all ecosystems, topography significantly influenced soil gross N mineralization and CO2 emissions. Topography had no significant impact on N2O and CH4 fluxes most likely because net fluxes were extremely low throughout landscapes. Soil gross N mineralization and CO2 emissions increased from Up. Back, to Low and from hummock to interhummock landform units. For example, at Churchill, soil gross mineralization rates averaged 4 mg N-NH4+ kg(-1) in upper slopes and progressively increased to about 25 mg N-NH4+ kg(-1) d(-1) in the lower slopes. Similarly, CO2 emission rates at Daring Lake averaged 0.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in upper slopes and progressively increased to about 2.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the lower slopes. Comparisons among ecosystems showed that Churchill (Sub-Arctic) had the highest gross N mineralization rates followed by Truelove (High-Arctic) and Daring Lake (Low-Arctic). Furthermore, Daring Lake had significantly higher CO2 emissions than Churchill and no difference in CH4 and N2O emissions between both ecosystems was found. These findings suggest that all factors influencing C and N cycling processes such as climate and human induced changes may not have similar effects across landscapes or across Arctic ecosystems.

A Case Study in a Shallow Hypereutrophic Reservoir	WATER												Water transparency is widely used in environmental monitoring programs and in assessing water quality in aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was to determine which of two water transparency-measuring tools, a Secchi disk or a water turbidity meter, is better to assess environments in shallow eutrophic waters. Measurements of the Secchi disk depth (Dsd) and water turbidity (Turb) were carried out simultaneously at eight stations of the hypereutrophic Sestroretsky Razliv reservoir in 2015-2018. In May, October, and December, Dsd varied around 0.6 m but was significantly lower in August during algal blooms. Turbidity ranged from 10 to 20 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) in different seasons but increased to almost 70 NTU in August. Principal component analysis revealed that Dsd was inversely proportional to Turb, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll concentrations. The data showed that at turbidities below 20 NTU, the Secchi disk clearly distinguishes differences in water transparency, but when Turb exceeds 40 NTU, measuring transparency using the Secchi disk no longer allows for water differentiation. In this case, it is preferable to use water turbidity measurements, which remain an effective indicator even in highly turbid waters. This should be taken into account when assessing the environment in eutrophic waters.

Significant effort has been made to understand changes in climatic patterns; however, less has been done to investigate the driving factors that influence the trends of early rainfall over Malawi. Hence, a substantial research gap exists concerning in the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures. The present study investigates the implications of atmospheric aerosols on precipitation during the early rainfall season over Malawi. Open burning, such as bushfires and burning of crop residues by local farmers, are the major anthropogenic activities enhancing aerosol accumulation in the atmosphere and hence need to be strictly controlled over the domain and the surrounding region. The present results show that rainfall generally starts between October and November and gradually increases with the maximum observed in January and ends in March in most areas. Monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD(550)) has an opposite pattern to that of rainfall with high AOD(550) (>0.4) between September and October, mostly over southern areas and along with Lake Malawi. An analysis of rainfall during the beginning of the season indicates a significant decrease of rainfall over the southern areas of Malawi, associated with high AOD(550), while insignificant change is observed over the central and northern areas associated with low AOD(550) values. Statistical analyses among AOD(550), cloud effective radius (CER), and precipitation demonstrates that negative trends of rainfall are strongly associated with a high concentration of anthropogenic aerosols from biomass burning during October. These aerosols might have absorbed excess moisture and disrupted local convective processes associated with the first rainfall that the domain receives, between the months of October and November. Therefore, regional control measures are required to reduce the excess emissions of anthropogenic aerosols into the atmosphere, such as controlling open burning during the active fire period (July-October).

Its impacts on aquatic ecosystems have attracted extensive attention. This study was carried out in Gaoyou Lake, China. We investigated environmental variables and phytoplankton in areas with different aquaculture intensities over four seasons. Marked differences in diversity, biomass and phytoplankton community structure were observed across areas. The 59 phytoplankton taxa identified could be divided into 20 functional groups (PFGs), of which groups B, D, E, J, MP, P, S1, W1 and Y were dominant PFGs in different areas. Total phosphorus (TP), ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus (TN/TP) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) were important driving factors for spatial differences in phytoplankton functional groups. Aquaculture altered the phytoplankton community structure, leading to a significant increase in phytoplankton biomass and diversity, especially cyanobacterial biomass. However, phytoplankton biomass and diversity could be significantly reduced and restored to natural levels after the cessation of aquaculture. This study clarified the effects of aquaculture activity on the phytoplankton community, thereby providing fundamental information for better understanding the impacts of aquaculture on lake eutrophication.

In particular, it is unclear whether empirical cyanobacterial models vary regionally because of differences in environmental conditions and (or) community composition. To address this question, we applied linear and nonlinear models as well as mixed-effect models to a dataset of seasonally integrated environmental and cyanobacterial measurements collected from 149 lakes spread across three regions in Canada. Across all lakes, we found that linear models outperformed nonlinear approaches and that nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) were the best predictors of cyanobacterial biomass. Importantly, there was no significant regional difference in predicted cyanobacterial responses to nutrients, even though the means for these variables were different among regions. From canonical correspondence analyses of taxonomic biomass data, temperature, water column stability, and forms of inorganic nitrogen were also important in explaining cyanobacterial community structure at the regional scale. Based on these analyses, we conclude that North American models are suitable for estimating total cyanobacterial biomass from any particular temperate region in Canada.

Cause-effect-response chains linking source identification of eroded sediments, loss of aquatic ecosystem integrity and management options in a steppe river catchment (Kharaa, Mongolia)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Although sparsely populated, the progressive degradation of Mongolia's rivers, lakes and groundwater, driven by land-use changes, poses a key challenge for the future sustainable development of the country. This paper deciphers the cause-effect-response chain between river bank degradation, changes of the ecological status, declines of ecosystem functions and priority measures with the case of the Kharaa River in Northern Mongolia. The underlying research approach comprised: (1) hydromorphological characterisation of the Kharaa River, (2) water quality assessments, (3) determination of the riverbed composition including hyporheic zone properties, (4) the analysis of riverine biota (macroinvertebrates and primary producers) and (5) the identification of the sources of suspended and settled sediments. The assessment revealed a gradient of spatially heterogeneous river bank erosion due to the degradation of the riparian vegetation caused by over-grazing and wood utilization. As the most prominent ecological response, the biomass of benthic algae decreased and macrozoobenthic community metrics changed continuously along the pressure gradient, accompanied by shifts of habitat related functional traits. At the same time, the hyporheic zone dimensions and functioning were affected by suspended and infiltrated sediments in multiple ways (restricted spatial extent, lowered hydraulic connectivity, lower metabolism, ecologically critical quality of pore water). Geochemical and radionuclide fallout isotope fingerprinting has identified riverbank erosion as the main source of the suspended sediments in the Kharaa River, when compared to gully and land surface erosion. Erosion susceptibility calculations in combination with suspended sediment observations showed a strong seasonal and annual variability of sediment input and instream transport, and a strong connection of erosional behaviour with land-use. Amongst others, the protection of headwaters and the stabilization of the river bank erosion hotspots in the midstream sections of the Kharaa River are the priority measures to avoid further degradation of the aquatic ecosystem status and functions.					; Rode, Michael/ABA-4786-2021; Borchardt, Dietrich/D-1729-2009	Rode, Michael/0000-0003-0086-2033; Borchardt, Dietrich/0000-0002-6074-2829													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2016	75	10							855	10.1007/s12665-015-5092-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-5092-1													WOS:000376589500008

The composition of the bacterial communities was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization method. Total number of bacteria in the lakes ranged from 4.0 to 7.48 cells x 10(6) mL(-1) with dominance by Actinobacteria, the contribution of which was positively correlated with water level. Old river channels (side-arms) featured Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The community of Betaproteobacteria was limited by concentration of dissolved organic carbon. Archaea, in spite of a minor role (<3.65% of DAPI-4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in the communities, showed a positive relation to floodplain lake isolation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that bacterioplankton in riverine lakes was similar to that in rivers, while lakes with limited water exchange showed a similarity to fertile lakes. Water level and nutrients were among the factors determining bacterial community structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

A large, shallow, slightly saline lacustrine system developed in the study area, promoting the occurrence of salt-tolerant plant communities on the lake margin. The regional landscape of the basin was characterised by grass-dominated, savannah-like vegetation under a warm (MAT: 13.8-18.8 degrees C) and semi-arid (MPwet: 151-71 mm, MPdry: 45-4 mm) climatic regime with marked seasonality of temperature and precipitation. These data reopen the debate on the origin of grasslands linked to dry conditions in Europe. Overall increased cooling and aridity through the Miocene led to the onset of grass-dominated habitats at the expense of forests, a process that in eastern Europe has been shown to occur from the Late Miocene. Our results, together with previous palaeobotanical and fossil mammal data from southern and central Spain, strongly indicate that open habitats were already prevalent in the Iberian Peninsula in the Middle Miocene, suggesting an earlier establishment here than in eastern Europe, possibly following a temporal pattern like the Anatolian Peninsula. The taxonomic diversity yielded by the samples from the Madrid Basin contributes to the understanding of the floristic composition of these early open habitats which were dominated by Poaceae, Amaranthaceae and Asteraceae with scattered shrubby and arboreal plants adapted to dry conditions such as Ricinus, Ephedra, Olea, Quercus, Acacia and Pinus. The age of the studied samples, coincident with the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition, indicates that this climatic episode marked an important step towards the establishment of open vegetation.					; Barrón, Eduardo/L-4726-2014; Postigo-Mijarra, José Mª/AIB-4968-2022; Gallego, Manuel/ABE-8307-2020	Casas Gallego, Manuel/0000-0002-9802-9762; Postigo-Mijarra, Jose Maria/0000-0001-7352-4858; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2021	581								110603	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110603		OCT 2021											WOS:000704173300001

In order to gain further insight into the hydrologic behaviour of lake-stream systems, we conducted a study using long-term streamflow data to investigate the annual-, seasonal- and event-scale streamflow regimes of a lake-stream network at the Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) in central Ontario, Canada. Streamflow metrics were compared for seven lake and 12 no-lake catchments within the TLW, in addition to 14 no-lake catchments from other forested landscapes. It was difficult to attribute patterns in annual streamflow regimes to the influence of lakes due to the confounding influence of catchment size; however, streamflow regimes appeared to be less flashy at locations with more lake influence. In addition, lake catchments showed high similarity in streamflow regimes across seasons, whereas no-lake catchments showed more similarity to lake catchments during wet seasons but less similarity during dry seasons. Event-scale streamflow regimes further downstream from lake outlets were associated with greater increases in peakflow response and hydrograph rise rate following rain events than locations closer to lake outlets. Antecedent conditions were also important for both the peakflow response and rise rate, but less so than the amount of rainfall during the event. Variability in streamflow across lake-stream networks appears to be driven by interactions between delayed contributions from lakes and relatively rapid runoff contributions from hillslopes and tributaries without lakes. In addition, streamflow regimes are influenced by temporal changes in lake storage deficits, which are a function of lake and catchment properties, as well as hydrometeorological conditions. Our results highlight that a network-scale perspective that incorporates lakes and streams is needed to understand how these landscapes will hydrologically respond to environmental change.

Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the stn gene of Salmonella species isolated from different environmental sources at Lake Qarun protectorate: The role of migratory birds and public health importance	VETERINARY WORLD												Background and Aim: Salmonella causes most foodborne bacterial illnesses worldwide. It is found in various hosts, including pets, farm animals, and wild animals, as well as the environment. This study aimed to examine the epidemiological relationship between Salmonella isolates from aquatic environments and those from other avian hosts. Materials and Methods: The study examined 12 water samples, 210 aquatic animals, and 45 migratory aquatic bird samples collected from the protected area of Lake Qarun in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during migration seasons from different waterfowl migration areas (from October 2018 to January 2019). In addition, 45 fecal samples from domestic chickens were collected from the same geographic location from poultry farms. Bacteriological examination and polymerase chain reaction assay of two virulence genes (i.e., invA and stn) were performed to isolate and identify Salmonella. Results: Salmonella was isolated from 58.3% (7/12) of Lake Qarun water samples, 13.3% (6/45) of migratory waterfowl, 6.6% of (3/45) of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus), and 4.3% (3/70) of fish and pooled brine shrimp. In migratory aquatic bird species that were sampled, Salmonella were isolated from 23.1% (3/13) of Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), 12.5%, (1/8) of green-winged teal (Anas cardolinesis), 10% (2/20) of northern shoveler (Spatula clypeala), and 0% (0/4) of mallard duck (Anas plaiyrhynchos). In 35 Tilapia, Salmonella was isolated by (8.6%) 5.7% of external surfaces, 2.85% from the intestine, and 0% from the muscle. No Salmonella was isolated from the 175 brine shrimp samples. Phylogenetic analysis using the stn genes of Salmonella isolated from the aquatic environment, migratory aquatic birds, and chicken showed a strong association between these isolates. In addition, a higher nucleotide identity percentage was observed between the sequences recovered from migratory aquatic birds and Lake Qarun water samples. Conclusion: Salmonella distribution was confirmed through migratory aquatic birds, based on our phylogeny tree analysis, Salmonella considered a likely carrier of zoonotic bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, the close relationship between chicken and fish sequences highlights the scenarios of using chicken manure in fish farms and its public health implications. The presence of Salmonella in different environmental sources spotlights the urgent need to control and break down its epidemiological cycle.					; Ismail, Eman M./KBA-8845-2024; khalefa, hanan/KGM-1126-2024; Elshafiee, Esraa/GVU-6969-2022	Abdel-Kader, Fatma/0000-0002-5545-2448; Khalefa, Hanan saad/0000-0003-1261-9313; Ismail, Eman/0000-0001-6191-6950; Ahmed, Zeinab/0000-0003-2013-3460; Elshafiee, Esraa/0000-0002-6127-5716													0972-8988	2231-0916				OCT	2021	14	10					2764	2772		10.14202/vetworld.2021.2764-2772	http://dx.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2021.2764-2772								34903938					WOS:000836238300025

Herein, we mapped and surveyed individual trees in two undisturbed Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) treeline plots (with a size: 30 m x 200 m; plot NE1: 4477 m, NE2: 4451 m) near Ranwu Lake (RW) on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The surface pattern method and spatial point pattern analysis were used to detect the spatial distribution patterns of three size classes (seedlings, juveniles, adults) and spatial associations between the pairwise size classes. We also compared our results to the spatial patterns of the five other treeline forests (Deqin, Linzhi, Changdu, Yushu, Aba) reported from the Tibetan Plateau. Young trees dominated the two fir treeline plots. Both positive and negative spatial autocorrelations for all of the trees were detected in two study plots. Intraspecific facilitation and competition coexisted at the fir treelines in three forest regions (RW, Linzhi, Aba) characterized by a mild moist climate, whereas intraspecific facilitation dominated the other three forest regions (Changdu, Deqin, Yushu), which featured seasonal climatic stress or high disturbance pressure. Thus, increased stem density at alpine treeline can be linked to competitive interactions in relatively favorable environmental conditions. Overall, the spatial patterns of the treeline population are mainly shaped by the combination of thermal and moisture conditions and are also modulated by non-climatic variables (e.g., disturbance history and microtopography).					; Ren, Ping/AAB-1474-2021; Sigdel, Shalik/AAI-1942-2021	Ren, Ping/0000-0001-7647-8666; Sigdel, Shalik Ram/0000-0003-0176-5382														1999-4907				OCT	2021	12	10							1417	10.3390/f12101417	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12101417													WOS:000713907000001
J	Behling, H; Pillar, VD; Orlóic, L; Bauermann, SG				Behling, H; Pillar, VD; Orlóic, L; Bauermann, SG			Late Quaternary Araucaria forest, grassland (Campos),fire and climate dynamics, studied by high-resolution pollen, charcoal and multivariate analysis of the Cambara do Sul core in southern Brazil	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Late Quaternary vegetation, fire and climate dynamics have been studied based on high-resolution dated pollen and charcoal samples and multivariate data analysis. The samples were taken from a 212-cm-long sediment core of a bog in the Cambara do Sul region on the highlands of northeastern Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The records, including seven AMS radiocarbon dates, span 42 840 C-14 years, for the first time extending the reconstruction of past environmental changes on the southern Brazilian highlands back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and pre-LGM times. The last 1100 years provide a decadal resolution. Initially the site was a permanent shallow lake which became seasonally dry after 26 900 C-14 yr BP. Seasonal climate with a long annual dry period prevailed until the late Holocene. The climate was somewhat wetter from 42 840 to 41 470 C-14 yr BP and from 41 470 to 26 900 C-14 yr BP than during the LGM and the late-Glacial period. Natural fires were rare, but became very frequent after 7400 cal BP, suggesting human occupation of the southernmost Brazilian highlands since that time. The records suggest that a species-rich Campos (grassland) vegetation existed in the area under a relatively dry and cold climate during glacial times under possibly as low as -10degreesC. The record also suggests that small populations of Araucaria were probably only present in refugia of deep and protected valleys and/or on wetter coastal slopes. Campos vegetation existed-through the early and mid-Holocene until 4320 cal yr BP, after-which Araucaria forest expanded into the network of gallery forests along the streams. By 1100 cal yr BP the Araucaria forest replaced the Campos vegetation reflecting the onset of the wettest period with no marked annual dry season. The marked expansion of the Araucaria forest coincided with the reduction in fire. Between AD 1520 and 1770 Weinmannia became a common taxa in the Araucaria forest, suggesting a shift to warmer climatic conditions on the highlands. This interval was synchronous with a cool phase within the Little Ice Age known from North Atlantic land records. After about AD 1780 human activities changed the original forest composition, first by introducing cattle into the forest and than by selective logging of Araucaria trees. Multivariate analysis of the pollen data shows compositional changes that follow a trajectory alternating undirectional, random phases and phases with directional, sometimes fast transitions. The results also show that compositional changes in the vegetation are slower during cool periods (LGM compared to pre-LGM) and faster in warm periods (Holocene). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This paper evaluates the relationship between water quality variations on the distribution of cyanobacteria during a 12-month period in Batticaloa Lagoon (Sri Lanka) using Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlations. Drastic variations in pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and total phosphorus (TP) levels were reported, but not turbidity and NO3-. This brackish waterbody is hypereutrophic (TP levels > 0.1 mg/L). The cyanobacterial community contained 13 genera and 22 species. NO3- TP and turbidity levels positively influenced cyanobacterial abundance during all seasons indicating that nutrient (largely phosphorus) and sediment entry control is highly crucial along with periodic monitoring of cyanobacterial growth.

A successful liming intervention, performed in 1988-1990, returned pH levels in the lake to neutrality, and accelerated the reduction of aqueous trace metal concentrations. In this paper, we present an update knowledge of the chemical status of Lake Orta, focusing on the data collected from 1990 to 2014. In this period we sampled the lake at its deepest point (Qualba station), on a monthly (1990-2000) or seasonal (since 2001) basis. Samples were collected at nine depths through the water column, and analyzed for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, nutrients, and trace metals. Collectively, these data allowed us to evaluate the long-term response of the lake to the restoration treatment, with particular regard to its acid-base status; they also provided insights into emerging or potential critical issues, including eutrophication and re-suspension of trace metals that still linger in the lake. Furthermore, the evaluation of the present chemical condition of the lake is a precondition for any successive restoration measure, such as fish introduction. The recent data confirmed the lake's water quality has recovered, i.e. returned to a pre-pollution chemical state. Lake water values of pH and concentrations of ammonium, sulphate and base cations have stabilized. Alkalinity and nitrate concentrations are also expected to reach stable level in the next few years. Levels of nitrate, reactive silica, and phosphorus compounds are now regulated by algal uptake, providing indirect evidence of a partial biological recovery. For instance, both the inter-annual average decline and the reappearance of a seasonal signal in silica confirmed the presence of a stable diatom community. The lake is presently oligotrophic, and concentrations of both N and P compounds are steady and low throughout the year. However, a monthly check of nutrient levels of the lake and inflowing waters is recommended. The monitoring of base chemical variables, major ions and trace metals should be maintained to assess the overall status of the ecosystem in response to various drivers, including climate change.					; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; Mosello, Rosario/ABA-4690-2021; Kamburska, Lyudmila/ABG-2391-2020; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023	Mosello, Rosario/0000-0002-1873-0162; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; Kamburska, Lyudmila/0000-0001-5071-6953; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75			2			93	106		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1320	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1320													WOS:000374772200014

Nested 3D modeling of the spatial dynamics of nutrients and phytoplankton in a Lake Ontario nearshore zone	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Algal fouling has become a serious problem along Great Lakes' coastlines and difficult to diagnose due to spatial and hydrodynamic variability typical of nearshore zones. We applied a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model to a coastal segment of Lake Ontario to provide insight into the role of dynamics and external inputs relevant to algae growth. Lake-wide simulations with a 2 km grid were coupled to a higher resolution (100 m grid) domain. The nearshore model captured the complexity of stratification, mixing and upwelling, while revealing circulation patterns not evident at the lake-wide scale, likely exacerbating the local fouling problems. A wastewater outfall produced peaks in the spatial dynamics of TP and SRP in the nearshore, which decayed by 80% within the first kilometer of the outfall, and introduced considerable variability in P distributions. Tributaries affected TP distributions during high runoff periods but had smaller effects on SRP. Seasonal dynamics and average values of chlorophyll a in the domain were well reproduced, but there was evidence for an unrecognized sink for nitrate and/or errors in estimated nitrate loads. Comparisons between a dry year (2007) and wet one (2008) revealed only limited immediate effects on water quality variables from local tributary discharges. The model was able to predict major water quality variables that are important to nuisance algae growth despite present exclusion of dreissenid mussels and associated nutrient cycling. Simulations predicted repeated brief episodes of relatively high SRP, hard to capture in most observational programs but, if verified, would have important implications for nuisance algae growth.

Dongting Lake, located downstream of Three Gorges Dam, has a significant influence over flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR). To have a better WSC estimation of Dongting Lake, a multiple linear regression model was developed based on hydrodynamic simulation data of the typical flood processes in the past 3 decades. New hydrological insights for the region The multiple linear regression (MLR) model is developed by integrating of hydrodynamic simulation. Also, the effect of the water level (WL) at Chenglingji station and the WL difference in the lake (Yangliutan-Chenglingji) were investigated. The model can accurately estimate the WSC of Dongting Lake with an R2 of 0.984. The observation indicates that the WL difference within the lake has a great influence on the WSC and the flood regulation capacity ability with the same WL at Chenglingji station. The results of the study can provide a real-time estimation of the WSC of Dongting Lake which can provide useful information for flood control management.					; Wu, Zhiyuan/AAX-3075-2020; Chin, Ren Jie/X-1847-2019	Chin, Ren Jie/0000-0001-5422-5123; 														2214-5818				FEB	2024	51								101634	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101634		DEC 2023											WOS:001145236200001

Drivers restricting biodiversity in Australian saline lakes: a review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Inland saline lakes are well known to be less biodiverse than fresh waters. In Australia, the most important driver affecting biodiversity is salinity that imposes an inverse linear relationship. However, in detailed studies across a wide salinity spectrum, the relationship is scale dependent. This is mediated in part by the range of salinity tolerated becoming broader as the maximum tolerated salinity increases. Other factors of importance sometimes include hydrology, habitat heterogeneity, season, pH and oxygen, but these are usually not easy to quantify. Even rarer is the influence of colonisation by marine organisms, which is applicable only at some sites near the coastline and the influence of ionic proportions on the presence of some species and, hence, diversity. The contribution of predation or competition on diversity, reported in some overseas salinas, is suspected but yet to be proved in Australia. The crustacean component in saline lakes is more influenced by these drivers than is most of the insect fraction.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2021	72	4					462	468		10.1071/MF20205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF20205		NOV 2020											WOS:000588770000001

Although small waterbodies in humid subtropical climates have the potential to emit considerable amounts of GHG, their emission patterns have remained understudied. This study involved intensive measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a small reservoir and its upstream and downstream reaches located in subtropical Hong Kong. Our results revealed that a variety of metabolic, hydrological, and hydrochemical processes play a critical role in regulating its CO2 dynamics. The reservoir was an overall source of CO2 to the atmosphere with an average areal flux of 24.6 mmol m-2 d-1, and it occasionally functioned as a sink for atmospheric CO2 under intense solar radiation when primary productivity was high. This flux is on the low side relative to that of global (sub)tropical reservoirs, which was likely attributable to the prolonged history of the reservoir (>150 years) and the occasional undersaturation of CO2 in the water column. We also noticed pronounced differences in the underlying controls of CO2 dynamics between the reservoir and its upstream and downstream reaches, emphasizing the importance of taking into account the distinct characteristics of both lentic and lotic waters when evaluating catchment-scale CO2 fluxes.

A stable isotope record of late Quaternary hydrologic change in the north-western Brooks Range, Alaska (eastern Beringia)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A submillennial-resolution record of lake water oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) from chironomid head capsules is presented from Burial Lake, north-west Alaska. The record spans the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; similar to 20-16k cal a BP) to the present and shows a series of large lake delta O-18 shifts (similar to 5 parts per thousand). Relatively low delta O-18 values occurred during a period covering the LGM, when the lake was a shallow, closed-basin pond. Higher values characterize deglaciation (similar to 16-11.5k cal a BP) when the lake was still closed but lake levels were higher. A rapid decline between similar to 11 and 10.5k cal a BP indicates that lake levels rose to overflowing. Lake delta O-18 values are interpreted to reflect the combined effects of changes in lake hydrology, growing season temperature and meteoric source water as well as large-scale environmental changes impacting this site, including opening of the Bering Strait and shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns related to ice-sheet dynamics. The results indicate significant shifts in precipitation minus evaporation across the late Pleistocene to early Holocene transition, which are consistent with temporal patterns of vegetation change and paludification. This study provides new perspectives on the paleohydrology of eastern Beringia concomitant with human migration and major turnover in megafaunal assemblages. (C) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Monthly sampling conducted with activity traps deployed overnight in littoral (Hydrilla and Ceratophyllum beds), open water (Hydrilla beds) and marginal zone (Utricularia beds), revealed that the macrophyte beds support similar cladoceran diversities regardless of the habitat. Total species richness in all studied habitats ranged between 30 and 34 species, supporting up to 22 species in a trapping area of 0.09 m(2) at peak times, the majority belonging to the Chydoridae. In total, 40 species were recorded over the year, half of which were chydorids. Mixed cladoceran densities reached maxima of 160 333 ind.m(-2) for a single habitat at a given moment. The dominant species included Chydoridae (Anthalona, Kurzia, Dunhevedia and Ephemeroporus), Daphniidae (Ceriodaphnia), Macrothricidae (Macrothrix) and Ctenopoda (Latonopsis). Monthly variation in species richness was most obvious in the littoral zone, whereas monthly variation in densities occurred at all sites. Community composition and habitat preference were mainly structured by depth and pH, resulting in different assemblages per habitat, but with uniform communities in the littoral (Hydrilla and Ceratophyllum) beds in a single area. This study presents the first ecological survey of Cladocera using activity traps in a shallow tropical lake.

Solubilisation of mucilage induces changes in Microcystis colonial	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												This study was conducted to determine if the seasonal succession of Microcystis based on classification using its morphological characteristics was a result of changes in the colonial morphology of the same Microcystis species. The seasonal variation of Microcystis colonial morphology in Lake Taihu was investigated from June 2011 to November 2011 and found that M. ichthyoblabe, M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa successively dominated in Lake Taihu. Moreover, Microcystis colonies collected from Lake Taihu were soaked in deionised water in darkness at 4 degrees C, which resulted in changes in colonial morphology from a morphotype characteristic of M. ichthyoblabe to those characteristic of M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa. However, this change was not observed when samples were soaked in raw water from Lake Taihu. The change in morphology was also observed when samples were soaked in cationic solution containing only K, Na, Mg or Fe, but not in 20 mg L-1 Ca solution. These results suggest that the seasonal succession of Microcystis species can be considered a colonial morphological change induced by mucilage solubilisation.

Antibiotic use in adult outpatients in Switzerland in relation to regions, seasonality and point of care tests	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION												The use of antibiotics is highest in primary care and directly associated with antibiotic resistance in the community. We assessed regional variations in antibiotic use in primary care in Switzerland and explored prescription patterns in relation to the use of point of care tests. Defined daily doses of antibiotics per 1000 inhabitants (DDD1000pd) were calculated for the year 2007 from reimbursement data of the largest Swiss health insurer, based on the anatomic therapeutic chemical classification and the DDD methodology recommended by WHO. We present ecological associations by use of descriptive and regression analysis. We analysed data from 1 067 934 adults, representing 17.1% of the Swiss population. The rate of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the entire population was 8.5 DDD1000pd, and varied between 7.28 and 11.33 DDD1000pd for northwest Switzerland and the Lake Geneva region. DDD1000pd for the three most prescribed antibiotics were 2.90 for amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 1.77 for fluoroquinolones, and 1.34 for macrolides. Regions with higher DDD1000pd showed higher seasonal variability in antibiotic use and lower use of all point of care tests. In regression analysis for each class of antibiotics, the use of any point of care test was consistently associated with fewer antibiotic prescriptions. Prescription rates of primary care physicians showed variations between Swiss regions and were lower in northwest Switzerland and in physicians using point of care tests. Ecological studies are prone to bias and whether point of care tests reduce antibiotic use has to be investigated in pragmatic primary care trials.

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of landscape heterogeneity on entomological and parasitological indices of malaria in western Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional entomological and parasitological survey was conducted along an altitudinal transect in three eco-epidemiological zones: lakeshore along the lakeside, hillside, and highland plateau during the wet and dry seasons in 2020 in Kisumu County, Kenya. Larval habitats for Anopheles mosquitoes were identified and characterized. Adult mosquitoes were sampled using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). Finger prick blood samples were taken from residents and examined for malaria parasites by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Results: Increased risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection was associated with residency in the lakeshore zone, school-age children, rainy season, and no ITNs (chi(2) =41.201, df= 9, P < 0.0001). Similarly, lakeshore zone and the rainy season significantly increased Anopheles spp. abundance. However, house structures such as wall type and whether the eave spaces were closed or open, as well as the use of ITNs, did not affect Anopheles spp. densities in the homes chi(2)= 38.695, df=7, P < 0.0001). Anopheles funestus (41.8%) and An. arabiensis (29.1%) were the most abundant vectors in all zones. Sporozoite prevalence was 5.6% and 3.2% in the two species respectively. The lakeshore zone had the highest sporozoite prevalence (4.4%, 7/160) and inoculation rates (135.2 infective bites/person/year). High larval densities were significantly associated with lakeshore zone and hillside zones, animal hoof prints and tire truck larval habitats, wetland and pasture land, and the wet season. The larval habitat types differed significantly across the landscape zones and seasonality (chi(2) = 1453.044, df= 298, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The empirical evidence on the impact of landscape heterogeneity and seasonality on vector densities, parasite transmission, and Plasmodium infections in humans emphasizes the importance of tailoring specific adaptive environmental management interventions to specific landscape attributes to have a significant impact on transmission reduction.

Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ( > 1 km(2)) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km(2), 7,378.82 km(2), and 3,382.29 km(2), respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.

Seventeen functional groups (B, D, E, F, G, J, Lo, MP, P, S1, T, W1, W2, X1, X2, Xph, Y) were identified based on 34 species. The dominant groups were: J/B/P/D in dry season, X1/J/Xph/G/T in normal season and J in flood season. Phytoplankton abundance ranged from 5.33 x10(4) cells/L to 3.65 x 10(7) cells/L, with the highest value occurring in flood season and lowest in dry season. The vertical profile of dominant groups showed little differentiation except for F, which dominated surface layers over 20 m as a result of mixing water masses and higher transparency during dry season. However, the surface waters presented higher values of phytoplankton abundance than other layers, possibly because of greater irradiance. The significant explaining variables and their ability to describe the spatial distribution of the phytoplankton community in RDA differed seasonally as follows: dry season, NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N, TN:TP ratio and transparency (SD); normal season, temperature (WT), water depth, TN, NH4-N and NO3-N; flood season, WT, water depth, NO3-N and NO2-N. Furthennore, nitrogen, water temperature, SD and water depth were significant variables explaining the variance of phytoplankton communities when datasets included all samples. The results indicated that water physical conditions and hydrology were important in phytoplankton community dynamics, and nitrogen was more important than phosphorus in modifying phytoplankton communities. Seasonal differences in the relationship between the environment and phytoplankton community should be considered in water quality management.

J	Noli, F; Tsamos, P				Noli, Fotini; Tsamos, Panagiotis			Seasonal variations of natural radionuclides, minor and trace elements in lake sediments and water in a lignite mining area of North-Western Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The radiological and chemical pollution of a cluster of four lakes in a lignite mining area of North-Western Greece was investigated using a variety of analytical techniques. Alpha spectrometry was applied to measure the activity concentrations of the uranium radioisotopes (U-234, U-235, and U-238) in waters. The mass activities of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 in sediments were measured by high-resolution gamma spectrometry. Furthermore, the determination of the minor and trace elements was carried out by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) in both water and sediments samples, respectively. Pollution levels were also evaluated by calculating enrichment factors (EFs), contamination factors (CFs) and pollution load index (PLI). The data were discussed taking into account several parameters such as the distance from the pollution source, temperature, and location and showed that the environmental impact in this region could not be considered as negligible. The deviation of the isotopic ratio of U-234/U-238 from the equilibrium value indicated waters with intensive dissolution of uranium. The activity values in both waters and sediments found to be low in cool periods and increased in warm periods. Moreover, the concentrations of the elements U, Zn, and Fe were raised in water samples indicating possible pollution as well as the CFs and PLI denoted accumulation in the sediments and moderate to severe contamination for Zn and Cr in some cases.

To explore influences of cyanobacterial blooms on dynamics of both particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), which are at the base of the food chain, an investigation was conducted from December 2014 to November 2015 that included various stages of the seasonal cyanobacterial blooms (dominated by Microcystis) in a large-shallow eutrophic Chinese lake (Taihu Lake). Data from eight sites of the lake are compiled into a representative seasonal cycle to assess general patterns of POM and DOM dynamics Compared to December, 5-fold and 3.5-fold increases were observed in July for particulate organic carbon (POC, 3.05-15.37 mg/L) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 5.48-19.25 mg/L), respectively, with chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations varying from 8.2 to 97.7 mu g/L. Approximately 40% to 76% of total organic carbon was partitioned into DOC. All C, N, and P in POM and DOC were significantly correlated with Chl a. POC:Chl a ratios were low, whereas proportions of the estimated phytoplankton-derived organic matter in total POM were high during bloom seasons. These results suggested that contributions of cyanobacterial blooms to POM and DOC varied seasonally. Seasonal average C:P ratios in POM and DOM varied from 79 to 187 and 299 to 2 175, respectively. Both peaked in July and then sharply decreased. Redundancy analysis revealed that Chi a explained most of the variations of C:N:P ratios in POM, whereas temperature was the most explanatory factor for DOM. These findings suggest that dense cyanobacterial blooms caused both C-rich POM and DOM, thereby providing clues for understanding their influence on ecosystems.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023														2096-5508					MAY	2018	36	3					738	749		10.1007/s00343-018-7031-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-7031-y													WOS:000438791100013

In China, rapid urbanization has led to agricultural decline in some regions. To stimulate agriculture, the Chinese government has recently increased its effort in farmland consolidation by providing special support to large farms in an attempt to address land-use inefficiency associated with small farming operations in rural areas. Focusing on the Poyang Lake Region (PLR), we develop an empirical Cellular Automata (CA) model to explore future agricultural land use and examine the impact of farmland consolidation, with the intention of providing insight for policy to effectively promote food production. The PLR is an important rice producing area for Jiangxi Province and China. In the PLR, rice can be grown once a year on a plot, called one-season rice, or twice a year on the same plot, called two-season rice. Our CA model simulates the transition between one-season and two-season rice. We use the modeling results to identify five types of areas (zones) where rice cultivation is (i) relatively stable for one-season rice, (ii) more likely to be one-season rice, (iii) of equal probability for either type, (iv) more likely to be two-season rice, and (v) relatively stable for two-season rice. In addition we explore the characteristics of these zones in terms of biophysical and geographical features to offer a detailed analysis and discussion of how the government may prioritize areas for interventions to sustain rice production amid urbanization. Our analysis also shows some positive effect of farmland consolidation on increasing rice production in the study area.

The fossil specimens were extracted from samples collected in the Chicalhao clay pit complex, near the village of Juncal from sediments belonging to the Figueira da Foz Formation. The plant bearing sequence is considered to be of Late Aptian-Early Albian age. Palynomorphs and mesofossils are generally well-preserved and include about 63 taxa. The palynoflora is dominated by conifer pollen and fern spores. Angiosperm pollen is also present, but subordinate among the palynomorphs. In contrast, angiosperms completely dominate the mesofossil flora and are mainly represented by fruits and seeds. Four taxa of angiosperm flowers were also identified. The combined palaeobotanical and sedimentological evidence indicates seasonally dry climate and an open vegetation consisting of a mixed conifer forest with an understorey and ground cover of ferns and angiosperms and with patchy occurrences of lycophytes and plants of the Bennettitales-Erdtmanithecales-Gnetales (BEG) group. Angiosperms probably inhabited moister areas bordering rivers and lakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 209 species belonging to 7 divisions were identified during the study period. The highest phytoplankton cell density (5.17 x 10(4) cells L-1) and biomass (7.68 mg m(-3) chlorophyll a) were observed in the upper sections during the nonmonsoon period, while the highest diversity (3.46) was observed in the upper section during the monsoon period. Bacillariophyta was the dominant phytoplankton group at 71% of the total species identified. This group was dominated by Pennales (88) over Centrales (60) at all 3 stations. Contributions of Dinophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Haptophyta, Chromophyta, and Chrysophyta to the total species were 25%, 0.5%, 1%, 0.5%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. Dinophyta did not show significant variations in percentage distribution among the 3 sections and seasons. Twenty-six dominant species of phytoplankton, representing all seasons with cell density of >1000 cells L-1, showed spatial adaptability patterns with respect to salinity. Protoperidinium acbromaticum and Alexandrium ostenfeldii were found to grow only during nonmonsoon periods in upper sections and were reported for first time in the present study. Euryhaline Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii were present throughout the study period. A total of 36 harmful algal bloom-forming species, with 11 toxin-producing species, have been identified. The presence of Streptotheca thamensis acts as an indicator to evaluate water quality.																			1300-008X	1303-6106					2014	38	4					800	818		10.3906/bot-1309-29	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/bot-1309-29													WOS:000336620000017

The role of wind in the dispersal of floating seeds in slow-flowing or stagnant water bodies	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat is the role of wind in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in slow-flowing and stagnant water bodies at different temporal and spatial scales? (i) Is there a direct effect of wind on seed dispersal speed and distance? (ii) Are prevailing wind conditions reflected in the seed deposition patterns during a year? (iii) What are the long-term (multiple year) effects of prevailing wind conditions on the pattern and composition of shoreline seed banks? LocationThe Westbroekse Zodden (5210N; 507E) and De Weerribben (52 degrees 46N; 5 degrees 55E) fen reserves in The Netherlands. MethodsReal-time seed movement tracking experiments were conducted at different wind speeds. Additionally, we performed a seed trap experiment using artificial grass mats and carried out seed bank analyses using a seedling emergence test. ResultsWind speed and direction strongly determined the dispersal process and the resulting deposition patterns of floating seeds in shallow lakes or ponds. Wind speed directly influenced dispersal speed and distance. Increasing wind speed increased dispersal speed but decreased dispersal distance. Over multiple seasons, more seeds were deposited at downwind shorelines than at upwind shorelines, showing that wind-driven hydrochory resulted in directional transport according to the prevailing wind direction. The species composition of deposited seeds was also affected, with proportionally more water-dispersed seeds being deposited at down-wind shorelines. These effects of wind speed and directionality will have consequences for the colonization of riparian zones in lentic systems and, therefore, also influence management and restoration. In the long term, local seed banks in riparian zones reflected the prevailing wind conditions poorly, showing that additional processes, such as differential germination and predation, also play important roles at longer time scales. ConclusionsWind plays an important role in the dispersal of waterborne seeds in lentic systems and (prevailing) wind speed and direction are reflected in seed dispersal trajectories and deposition patterns.

Temperature-mediated en route migration mortality and travel rates of endangered Snake River sockeye salmon	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Conservation efforts for endangered Snake River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been hindered by high en route adult mortality during their similar to 1450 km freshwater spawning migration. Identifying causal factors for this mortality has been difficult given very small (often <10 fish) annual returns in recent decades. However, several hundred hatchery-bred fish returned in 2000 and we intercepted and radio-tagged 31 in mid-migration to monitor behaviours and survival. All fish initially migrated at similar rates, but later-timed fish eventually slowed migration and were far more likely to be unsuccessful. Late-season mortality was strongly associated with water temperatures near tolerance thresholds (21-24 degrees C). The data also suggest increased risk for fish in poor initial condition (i.e., with injuries or parasites) and probable recent selection against late-timed salmon. Results parallel temperature- and condition-related adult mortality in Columbia and Fraser River sockeye salmon populations and demonstrate the potential vulnerability of marginal southern populations to regional climate warming.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				MAR	2008	17	1					136	145		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00267.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00267.x													WOS:000252711800016

As previously observed in 2008, even during 2009 DDTs concentrations were higher in zooplankton than in fish, probably due to the very unstable situation of the lake still influenced by local inputs. The situation changed in 2010, when all DDT compounds increased in fish to levels much higher than those measured in zooplankton. Biomagnification was statistically demonstrated for pp'DDE in all the three fish species, indicating a probable signal of recovery of the lake. Although with respect to total PCBs we observed that the contamination levels varied across time periods and across fish species, biomagnification was evident from zooplankton to fish both in 2009 and in 2010. As concern individual PCBs, biomagnification from zooplankton to all three fish species was significant for PCB 153 and PCB 138. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, seasonal changes in sediment microbiome with different terrestrial pollutants input have not yet been clearly understood. Metagenomic sequencing was used to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations and different land use types on sediment microbiome. Results showed that the differences in structure and functions of sediment microbiome among different land use types were obviously greater than different seasons. This indicated that the terrestrial pollutants weakened the effects of seasonal variations on shaping the sediment microbiome. The significant differences in sediment properties under the input of different terrestrial pollutants was observed, but no obvious differences between seasons, which may be the reason why terrestrial pollutants override the effects of seasonal variation on the sediment microbiome. Overall, the results extended our understanding of the impacts of seasonal variation and terrestrial pollutants on river sediment microbiome.					sun, bo/JFA-9978-2023; zhang, jianyun/X-7292-2018; Qiu, Han/JWP-5130-2024; He, Shanshan/GNW-3399-2022														0007-4861	1432-0800				DEC	2020	105	6					892	898		10.1007/s00128-020-03033-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-020-03033-2		NOV 2020						33152096					WOS:000586370000001

Hydroclimatology of Lake Victoria region using hydrologic model and satellite remote sensing data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Study of hydro-climatology at a range of temporal scales is important in understanding and ultimately mitigating the potential severe impacts of hydrological extreme events such as floods and droughts. Using daily in-situ data over the last two decades combined with the recently available multiple-years satellite remote sensing data, we analyzed and simulated, with a distributed hydrologic model, the hydro-climatology in Nzoia, one of the major contributing sub-basins of Lake Victoria in the East African highlands. The basin, with a semi arid climate, has no sustained base flow contribution to Lake Victoria. The short spell of high discharge showed that rain is the prime cause of floods in the basin. There is only a marginal increase in annual mean discharge over the last 21 years. The 2-, 5- and 10-year peak discharges, for the entire study period showed that more years since the mid 1990's have had high peak discharges despite having relatively less annual rain. The study also presents the hydrologic model calibration and validation results over the Nzoia basin. The spatiotemporal variability of the water cycle components were quantified using a hydrologic model, with in-situ and multi-satellite remote sensing datasets. The model is calibrated using daily observed discharge data for the period between 1985 and 1999, for which model performance is estimated with a Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSCE) of 0.87 and 0.23% bias. The model validation showed an error metrics with NSCE of 0.65 and 1.04% bias. Moreover, the hydrologic capability of satellite precipitation (TRMM-3B42 V6) is evaluated. In terms of reconstruction of the water cycle components the spatial distribution and time series of modeling results for precipitation and runoff showed considerable agreement with the monthly model runoff estimates and gauge observations. Runoff values responded to precipitation events that occurred across the catchment during the wet season from March to early June. The spatially distributed model inputs, states, and outputs, were found to be useful for understanding the hydrologic behavior at the catchment scale. The monthly peak runoff is observed in the months of April, May and November. The analysis revealed a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff for both wet and dry seasons. Satellite precipitation forcing data showed the potential to be used not only for the investigation of water balance but also for addressing issues pertaining to sustainability of the resources at the catchment scale.

It is located in Amhara Region in the north western Ethiopian highlands. The mean elevation of the Basin is 2025 masl (meter above sea level), with the highest elevations at some 4100 masl in the Simien Mountains, in the north-eastern part of the basin and the lowest at the outlet of the lake into the Blue Nile at 1786 masl. The topography in the eastern side of the basin is dominated by the presence of two large shield volcanoes, Mt. Choke and Mt. Guna, while in the west it drops sharply to the adjacent Beles and Dinder basins. Bahir Dar city is located in the southern tip of the lake where the outlet of the lake into the Blue Nile River. The climate of the region is tropical highland monsoon with one rainy season between June and September. The air temperature shows a large diurnal but small seasonal change with an annual average of 20 degrees C. The distribution of rainfall of the region is controlled by the movement of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) to the northward and southward. Based on rainfall variability analysis, 57.5% of the basin is found under less rainfall variability. Little has been done so far on understanding the effect of climate change on rainfall amount and distribution and hence of the Basin Rivers flows. The largest area of the basin (88.5%) is not affected by frost hazard.					; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/GXG-2437-2022; Nigate, Fenta/AAV-8621-2021; Abebe, wubneh/E-7774-2019	Sime Leggesse, Elias/0000-0003-2002-968X; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/0000-0003-2072-7146; Nigate, Fenta/0000-0003-1002-9408													2509-9787	2509-9795	978-3-319-45755-0; 978-3-319-45753-6				2017							51	58		10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_5	10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0												WOS:000419723900006
J	Lee, S; Kim, SU				Lee, Sangho; Kim, Sang Ug			Quantification of Hydrological Responses Due to Climate Change and Human Activities over Various Time Scales in South Korea	WATER												Hydrological responses are being impacted by both climate change and human activities. In particular, climate change and regional human activities have accelerated significantly during the last three decades in South Korea. The variation in runoff due to the two types of factors should be quantitatively investigated to aid effective water resources' planning and management. In water resources' planning, analysis using various time scales is useful where rainfall is unevenly distributed. However, few studies analyzed the impacts of these two factors over different time scales. In this study, hydrologic model-based approach and hydrologic sensitivity were used to separate the relative impacts of these two factors at monthly, seasonal and annual time scales in the Soyang Dam upper basin and the Seom River basin in South Korea. After trend analysis using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test to identify the causes of gradual change, three techniques, such as the double mass curve method, Pettitt's test and the BCP (Bayesian change point) analysis, were used to detect change points caused by abrupt changes in the collected observed runoff. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models calibrated from the natural periods were used to calculate the impacts of human activities. Additionally, six Budyko-based methods were used to verify the results obtained from the hydrological-based approach. The results show that impacts of climate change have been stronger than those of human activities in the Soyang Dam upper basin, while the impacts of human activities have been stronger than those of climate change in the Seom River basin. Additionally, the quantitative characteristics of relative impacts due to these two factors were identified at the monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. Finally, we suggest that the procedure used in this study can be used as a reference for regional water resources' planning and management.																				2073-4441				JAN	2017	9	1							34	10.3390/w9010034	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9010034													WOS:000392939900034

The basin is characterized by different volcanic formations covered by thick alluvial and residual Quaternary sediments at the center of the basin around Lake Tana. In this study, an attempt was made to outline the hydrogeology of the basin based on limited information from well lithologic logs and previous relevant works. The Lake Tana basin is considered as a potential area for surface water and groundwater development corridors. The hydrogeology and groundwater occurrence is complex due to tectonism and existence of different volcanic rocks covered with thick alluvial sediments at the center of the basin. The shallow aquifer systems in the middle of the basin from the alluvial sediments are tapped by local communities using shallow wells fitted with hand pumps. The volcanic aquifers are multi-layer and tapped from different volcanic layers. The latter are highly productive depending up on the degree of fracturing and weathering. In few cases, as in the case of Kola Diba area there are artesian wells. The groundwater system converges towards the center of the basin. The Lake Tana basin leaks groundwater to the adjacent Beles basin and through the Blue Nile outlet.					; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/GXG-2437-2022; Abebe, Wubneh/GXG-2437-2022; Nigate, Fenta/AAV-8621-2021	Nigate, Fenta/0000-0003-1002-9408; Abebe, Wubneh Belete/0000-0003-2072-7146; 													2509-9787	2509-9795	978-3-319-45755-0; 978-3-319-45753-6				2017							77	91		10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_7	10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0												WOS:000419723900008

Purnachandra			Iron ore pollution in Mandovi and Zuari estuarine sediments and its fate after mining ban	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Iron ore was mined from the banded iron formations of Goa, India, and transported through the Mandovi and Zuari estuaries for six decades until the ban on mining from September 2012. Here we focus on the environmental magnetic properties of sediments from the catchment area, upstream and downstream of these estuaries, and adjacent shelf during peak mining time. Magnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) values of sediments were highest in upstream (catchment area and estuaries), decreased gradually towards downstream (catchment area and estuaries), and were lowest on the adjacent shelf. The chi(lf) values of the Mandovi estuary were two to fourfold higher than those in the Zuari. The sediments of these two estuaries after the mining ban showed enrichment of older magnetite and sharp decrease in the SIRM values. Although the input of ore material has been reduced after mining ban, more flushing of estuarine sediments is required for healthier environment.

J	Zhao, J; Shu, W; Wang, LC; Zhang, XL				Zhao, Jun; Shu, Wang; Wang, Lachun; Zhang, Xueli			Severe drought changes the soil bacterial community in wetland ecosystem: Evidence from the largest freshwater lake wetland in China	LIMNOLOGICA												The Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is subject to drastic seasonal hydrological fluctuations due to the global climate change and human activities, resulting in the unclear impact of soil bacterial communities undergoing severe drought pressure. To elucidate this, soil samples were collected in Phragmites, Carex, and Phalaris, and were incubated in the laboratory under three moisture levels: 30% WHC (maximum water-hold capacity) representing severe drought, 50% WHC representing moderate drought, and 80% WHC representing suitable moisture conditions. Soil bacterial communities were profiled by the 16 S rRNA gene using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing technique. The results showed that the Shannon-Wiener index of bacterial com-munities decreased with the decrease of soil moisture. The Chao1 index decreased with the decrease of soil moisture in the Carex and Phalaris zone soils, while the index first decreased and then increased in the Phrag-mites zone soil. The Shannon-Wiener index was significantly different among the three dry-wet conditions (p = 0.017), whereas the Chao1 index was not (p = 0.813). Drought altered the relative abundance of different bacterial phyla. With the decrease of soil moisture, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased, whereas the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Nitrospirae decreased. LEfSe analysis showed that the number of differential species in the soil of different vegetation zones (n = 57) was significantly higher than the number of differential species under different drought conditions (n = 13). Overall, the differ-ence of soil properties in different vegetation zones has a greater effect on the bacterial community structure than that of different drought conditions in Poyang Lake wetland. This study enriched our knowledge of the drought conditions impact of bacterial communities on server drought lake ecosystems.					; Zhao, Jun/IUM-2453-2023; Shu, Wang/KIE-9533-2024	Shu, Wang/0000-0001-7982-6398; Zhao, Jun/0000-0002-7512-8215													0075-9511	1873-5851				NOV	2022	97								126023	10.1016/j.limno.2022.126023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.126023		SEP 2022											WOS:000863671800003

Seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude Llano reservoir (State of Mexico, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Llano reservoir is a high altitude waterbody and is of recreational importance in Mexico. It is also a source of revenue through fisheries. Though the reservoir was constructed nearly 6 decades ago, quantitative information on the zooplankton abundance is not available. The aim of the present study was to present data on the seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude waterbody Llano dam (State of Mexico) during a one year period. Methodology: Rotifer sampling was done monthly from 5 different littoral zones for one year (August 2014 to July 2015). Eighty liters of superficial water from the reservoir were concentrated to 200 ml through a plankton net of 50 mu m pore size and fixed in 4% formalin. Selected physico-chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrients (NO3- and PO4-3) and Chlorophyll a were also measured. Results: Temperature varied from 10-20 degrees C and pH 5-8. The reservoir had low turbidity (<3 NTU). nitrates (<60 mu g L-1), phosphates (<5 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (6-8 mu g L-1). In all, 84 species of monogonont rotifers (from 18 families and 39 genera) and 13 cladoceran species (from 3 families) were recorded. Aspelta angusta, Eosphora thoa, Trichocerca insulana and Lepadella punctata are new records for Mexico. Polyarthra vulgaris had the highest frequency of occurrence (98%), followed by Trichocerca bidens (90%) and Trichotria tectractis (75%). During April, we recorded the highest density (825 ind. I-1) of all rotifer species together, meanwhile for the rest of months, the density was low <300 ind. I-1. Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.0 to 4.2 bits ind. I-1, depending on the sampling period. The Sladetek's Q(B/T) index in this reservoir was generally 1. Interpretation: In addition to nutrient levels, Chla and Q(B/T), the total rotifer density as a useful measure to determine the trophic status of this waterbody was explored. Our data from nutrients and total rotifer density showed that the Llano reservoir appeared to be oligotrophic.					; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022	Munoz Colmenares, Manuel Eduardo/0000-0002-6506-529X; Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579													0254-8704					NOV	2017	38	6			SI		1171	1181		10.22438/jeb/38/6(SI)/02	http://dx.doi.org/10.22438/jeb/38/6(SI)/02													WOS:000417298100002

High-altitude aquatic ecosystems are characterized by extreme hydro-climatic constraints (e.g., low oxygen and high UV radiation). We studied, during two seasons, the diel cycles of MMHg in SW and sediment porewaters (PW) of Lake Uru Uru (3686 m a.s.l, Bolivia) contaminated by urban and mining activities. Our results show that diel changes in SW MMHg concentrations (up to 1.8 ng L-1) overwhelm seasonal ones, with higher MMHg accumulation during the night-time and the dry season. The calculation of MMHg diffusive fluxes demonstrates that the sediment compartment was the primary source of MMHg to the SW. Most MMHg efflux occurred during the dry season (35.7 +/- 17.4 ng m(-2) day(-1)), when the lake was relatively shallow, more eutrophicated, and with the redoxcline located above the sediment-water interface (SWI). Changes in MMHg accumulation in the PWs were attributed to diel redox oscillations around the SWI driving both the bacterial sulfate reduction and bio-methylation. Finally, we highlight that although MMHg loading from the PW to the SW is large, MMHg photodegradation and demethylation by microorganisms control the net MMHg accumulation in the water column.					; Acha, Dario/A-3547-2011; Point, David/GOE-5433-2022; Guedron, Stephane/K-7692-2018; Guédron, Stéphane/K-7692-2018	Point, David/0000-0002-5218-7781; FLORES COLQUE, MARIZOL GIOVANA/0009-0003-7415-2736; Acha, Dario/0000-0002-9498-069X; Amouroux, David/0000-0002-0056-8590; Heredia, Carlos R./0000-0002-0780-0612; Guedron, Stephane/0000-0003-4229-1566; Bouchet, Sylvain/0000-0002-5753-9643														2076-3417				NOV	2020	10	21							7936	10.3390/app10217936	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10217936													WOS:000588951800001

Results show TP varied from (0.3- 1.6 mg/l with an average value of 0.9 mg/l), NO3-N varied from (0.2-1.5 mg/l with an average value of 0.7 mg/l) and COD varied from (11-98 mg/l with an average value of 47.80 mg/l) and were compared with previous results of 1997 and 2007 to determine the decadal changes and impact of anthropogenic activities. Comparative results showed that TP, NO3-N, and COD had increased 2.3, 2.0, 1.75 times, respectively from 1997 to 2017 while the concentration of DO has decreased from the last two decades. The present experimental analysis indicates that Dal Lake is exposed to anthro-urban intensification due to an increase in anthropogenic activities in the catchment area, affecting the overall hydrogeochemistry of lake water.

J	Milewski, R; Chabrillat, S; Bookhagen, B				Milewski, Robert; Chabrillat, Sabine; Bookhagen, Bodo			Analyses of Namibian Seasonal Salt Pan Crust Dynamics and Climatic Drivers Using Landsat 8 Time-Series and Ground Data	REMOTE SENSING												Salt pans are highly dynamic environments that are difficult to study by in situ methods because of their harsh climatic conditions and large spatial areas. Remote sensing can help to elucidate their environmental dynamics and provide important constraints regarding their sedimentological, mineralogical, and hydrological evolution. This study utilizes spaceborne multitemporal multispectral optical data combined with spectral endmembers to document spatial distribution of surface crust types over time on the Omongwa pan located in the Namibian Kalahari. For this purpose, 49 surface samples were collected for spectral and mineralogical characterization during three field campaigns (2014-2016) reflecting different seasons and surface conditions of the salt pan. An approach was developed to allow the spatiotemporal analysis of the salt pan crust dynamics in a dense time-series consisting of 77 Landsat 8 cloud-free scenes between 2014 and 2017, covering at least three major wet-dry cycles. The established spectral analysis technique Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone (SMACC) extraction method was used to derive image endmembers from the Landsat time-series stack. Evaluation of the extracted endmember set revealed that the multispectral data allowed the differentiation of four endmembers associated with mineralogical mixtures of the crust's composition in dry conditions and three endmembers associated with flooded or muddy pan conditions. The dry crust endmember spectra have been identified in relation to visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the collected surface samples. According these results, the spectral endmembers are interpreted as efflorescent halite crust, mixed halite-gypsum crust, mixed calcite quartz sepiolite crust, and gypsum crust. For each Landsat scene the spatial distribution of these crust types was mapped with the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method and significant spatiotemporal dynamics of the major surface crust types were observed. Further, the surface crust dynamics were analyzed in comparison with the pan's moisture regime and other climatic parameters. The results show that the crust dynamics are mainly driven by flooding events in the wet season, but are also influenced by temperature and aeolian activity in the dry season. The approach utilized in this study combines the advantages of multitemporal satellite data for temporal event characterization with advantages from hyperspectral methods for the image and ground data analyses that allow improved mineralogical differentiation and characterization.					; Chabrilat, Sabine/H-6432-2019; Bookhagen, Bodo/A-1389-2012	Milewski, Robert/0000-0002-7835-7689; Bookhagen, Bodo/0000-0003-1323-6453; Chabrillat, Sabine/0000-0001-8600-5168														2072-4292				FEB	2020	12	3							474	10.3390/rs12030474	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12030474													WOS:000515393800133

Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-water system and biogenic elements in the littoral zone of Lake Baikal during period 2004-2018	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					International Conference on Freshwater Ecosystems - Key Problems	SEP 10-14, 2018	Irkutsk, RUSSIA					We report long-term comprehensive measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere, surface water and the major nutrients obtained for the period 2004-2018. The research was conducted at the Baikal Atmospheric and Limnological Observatory (BALO), which is located in the coastal zone of South Baikal (coordinates 51 degrees 54' N, 105 degrees 05' E). The seasonal variation of these characteristics was analyzed. For our site, during the open water period (May-December) we assessed average flux of CO2, which amounted to -155 mmol m(-2) y(-1) (sink from the atmosphere to the water surface). Carbon dioxide content in the near-water air of Lake Baikal rises with a rate of 2.46 ppm per year, which is in good agreement with the global trend. The common effect of many factors (often multi-directional), such as variability of weather conditions, hydrological processes and productivity cycles of aquatic plankton in the Baikal waters, cause strong variations in the water characteristics, which we observed in different seasons and years. Under these conditions of strong inter-annual and seasonal variability of all characteristics, trend calculations using our long-term observations did not allow us to reveal reliable tendencies of changes in surface water CO2 concentrations.

J	Tapia, J; Audry, S				Tapia, Joseline; Audry, Stephane			Control of early diagenesis processes on trace metal (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and U) and metalloid (As, Sb) behaviors in mining- and smelting-impacted lacustrine environments of the Bolivian Altiplano	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A combination of mineralogical (SEM-EDS, EMPA) and geochemical (redox dynamics, selective extractions) approaches was applied to mining- and smelting-impacted sediments from Lake Uru Uru and from the Cala Cala Lagoon, a non-impacted reference site, in the Bolivian Altiplano. The purpose was to assess the factors controlling the post-depositional redistribution (mobilization/sequestration) of trace metals and metalloids. As expected, trace metals and metalloids are less reactive at the reference site than in Lake Uru Uru. In the latter, trace metals and metalloids are principally hosted by Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides, authigenic sulfides and silicate particulates. Post-depositional redistribution is ascribed to early diagenetic processes driven by organic matter (OM) mineralization, including dissolution of trace metal-bearing phases and precipitation of authigenic sulfide and carbonate phases. Seasonal climate variability exerts a strong influence on these processes. Evaporation of surface water during the dry season in the northern part of Lake Uru Uru promotes large redox front oscillations in the sediments and, therefore, transient redox conditions, likely leading to the weakening of anoxia in near-surface sediments and to a 'compressed' redox zonation compared to the southern part of the lake. Seasonal disappearance of the water column in the Northern Lake Uru Uru entails an alternation of: (i) low trace element mobility in the dry season due to elemental precipitation; and (ii) an increase of trace element mobility via diffusive transport during the wet season due to release from OM, Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides and carbonates upon mineralization, reductive dissolution and destabilization processes, respectively. Reoxidation of authigenic Fe-sulfides likely following the re-instalment of the water column above the sediment at the end of the dry season and prior to the return of anoxia probably favors transport of trace elements to the water column. As a consequence of this intricate web of redox- and climate-related processes, both northern and southern sediments of Lake Uru Uru are a source of dissolved trace elements, particularly As and Cd, for the overlying water column via diffusive transport. However, much of the diffused As and Cd is likely to be removed from the dissolved phase by the redox loop through Fe-oxyhydroxide precipitation. Finally, it is suggested that long term sequestration of trace metals and metalloids in the sediments could be controlled by inter-annual climate variability such as ENSO events.

Five collections were carried out at each of the reservoirs at two depths (0.1 m and near the sediment) at three-month intervals in each season (dry and rainy). The phytoplankton samples were preserved in Lugol's solution and quantified under an inverted microscope for the determination of density values, which were subsequently converted to biomass values based on cellular biovolume and classified in phytoplankton associations. The following abiotic variables were analyzed: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, water transparency, total phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, orthophosphate and total nitrogen. The data were investigated using canonical correspondence analysis. The influence of seasonality on the dynamics of the phytoplankton community was lesser in the deeper reservoirs. Depth affected the behavior of the algal associations. Variation in light availability was a determinant of changes in the phytoplankton structure. Urosolenia and Anabaena associations were more abundant in shallow ecosystems with a larger eutrophic zone, whereas the Microcystis association was more related to deep ecosystems with adequate availability of nutrients. The distribution of Cyclotella, Geitlerinema, Planktothrix, Pseudanabaena and Cylindrospermopsis associations was different from that seen in subtropical regions and the substitution of these associations was related to a reduction in the eutrophic zone rather than the mixture zone.

The relationships between the fish assemblage and selected habitat features were examined in the North Tiaoxi River, one of headwaters of Taihu Lake. A total of 3,348 individuals belonging to 5 orders, 11 families, 25 genera and 34 species were collected including 33 native species and one invasive species. Among those, about 20 species were endemic to China. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was applied to compare fish assemblage structures from upstream to downstream during four seasons. Species assemblages differed along the stream continuum, but there was little apparent change associated with the seasons. Species richness and Shannon-Weaver index (H') tended to increase along the stream continuum from the upstream to downstream and the proportion of invertivorous fish tended to significantly decrease along the continuum with a parallel significant increase in the percentage of omnivores. Fish assemblages were significantly related to both water quality and habitat structure variables. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordinations (CCA) revealed that 6 of the 14 selected environmental variables had significant relationships with the fish assemblage such as distance to source, stream width, altitude, pH, water depth, and water velocity and different sampling sites were associated with different environmental variables in different seasons. The main differences in fish assemblage structure and diversity within the whole watercourse are probably related to large-scale factors such distance to source, altitude and stream width. Differences of instream characteristics are likely to be caused by natural variability of the ecosystems but also, in some case, by anthropogenic influence like human settlements, agriculture and river embankment and pollution from small factory.

J	Adler, M; Eckert, W; Sivan, O				Adler, Michal; Eckert, Werner; Sivan, Orit			Quantifying rates of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in Lake Kinneret sediments (Israel) using pore-water profiles	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Full seasonal sets of chemical and isotope profiles from the pore water of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) were produced to study methanogenesis and methanotrophy processes and the couplings between methane (CH(4)), sulfur, and iron. Sulfate is depleted within the upper 10 cm of the sediment mainly by traditional bacterial sulfate reduction by organic matter. Maximum sulfate reduction rates calculated from sulfate concentration profiles are found at the water-sediment interface (0-1 cm - 1.4 x 10(-12) +/- 0.2 x 10(-12) mol cm(-3) s(-1)). CH(4) concentrations and modeling of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its stable carbon isotope (delta(13)C(DIC)) suggest that maximum methanogenesis rates of 2.5 x 10(-13) +/- 1.5 x 10(-13) mol cm(-3) s(-1) occur at 5-12-cm depth in the sediments, and that it ends at 20 cm. Of the produced CH(4), 50-75% is converted to gas bubbles of CH(4) before it reaches the bottom water. Model results suggest the occurrence of anaerobic oxidation of CH(4) (AOM) in the deep sediments of the lake below the zone of methanogenesis.

We asked: (1) What is the extent, range, and magnitude of spatial heterogeneity in water quality conditions across the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes? and (2) How do features of anthropogenic development, sub-basin characteristics, anticipated coastal circulation, and weather influence water quality conditions in the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes? Principal Components Analysis explained 42% of the variation in water quality across the Canadian Great Lakes, with high spatial heterogeneity both within and among lakes, ranging from oligotrophic conditions in Lake Superior to eutrophic conditions in Lake Erie. Lakes Erie and Ontario generally had higher concentrations of chloride, chlorophyll a, and nutrients while higher silicate concentrations were observed in Lake Superior. Consistent patterns of degraded water quality were observed in Areas of Concern, such as Hamilton Harbour, Bay of Quinte, Nipigon Bay, and near Thunder Bay. Across the nearshore of the Canadian Great Lakes, regions with warmer air temperatures, in addition to urbanized and agricultural landscapes, were associated with deteriorated water quality. Our study highlights the importance of improving management practices across urban and agricultural landscapes, particularly in consideration of climatic change cumulatively degrading water quality conditions in the highly biologically, culturally, and socioeconomically important nearshore regions of the LGL.

This work investigated the spatio-temporal variations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) at the downstream section of Yichang-to-Chenglingji from 2002 to 2015. A random forest model was developed to estimate SSC using MODIS ground reflectance products, and the spatio-temporal distributions of SSC were retrieved with this model to investigate the characteristics of water-silt variation. Our results revealed that, relatively, SSC before 2003 was evenly distributed in the downstream Yangtze River, while this spatial distribution pattern changed ce 2003 when the dam started storing water. Temporally, the SSC demonstrated a W-shaped curve of seasonal variation as one peak occurred in September and two troughs in March and November, and showed a significantly decreasing trend after three-stage impoundment. After official operation of the TGD in 2009, the SSC was reduced by over 40% than before 2003. Spatially, the most significant changes occurred in the upper Jingjiang section, where the SSC dropped by 45%. During all stages of impoundment, the water impoundment to 135 m in 2003 had the most significant impact on suspended sediment. The decreased SSC has led to emerging risks of bank failure, aggravated erosion of water front and aggressive down-cutting erosion along the downstream of the dam, as well as other ecological and environmental issues that require urgent attention by the government.

J	Zhang, ZY; He, HX; Yu, CH; Zhang, W; Li, LY; Meng, LK				Zhang, Zhiyuan; He, Haixia; Yu, Changhui; Zhang, Wen; Li, Linyi; Meng, Lingkui			Using the modified two-mode method to identify surface water in Gaofen-1 images	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												The rapid, accurate, and automated extraction of surface water is highly important for conducting reliable and necessary surface water monitoring endeavors. Classification methods commonly exhibit high precision but also have a low degree of automation or narrow scope of application; commonly used water index methods are highly efficient, but they easily mistake other targets with similar spectral characteristics for surface water. Simultaneously achieving precision, efficiency, and automation within a single method is a challenge. To address these problems, we simplify the normalized different water index (NDWI) to a band ratio index and traverse the neighborhood of the extreme in the histogram to determine two peaks and one trough between the peaks in the two-mode method, and we then compare the middle value of the two peaks with the value of the trough to confirm the threshold of the surface water. We use the modified two-mode method to extract Poyang Lake from four Chinese Gaofen (GF)-1 remote sensing images corresponding to different seasons, and then compare the results with those obtained by the NDWI index and the maximization of interclass variance (OTSU) method. The comparison shows that our method has higher and more stable accuracy, especially during the drought period for Poyang Lake. However, polluted water, narrow rivers, bridges, and residential areas along the lake are sometimes mistakenly extracted. Finally, the advantages and prospects of the proposed method are discussed.

The highest pelagic seasonal average methane (CH4) emissions were up to 12 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from eutrophied lakes with agricultural catchments. Nutrient loading increases autochthonous primary production in lakes, promoting oxygen consumption and anaerobic decomposition in the sediments and this can lead to increased CH4 release from lakes to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were higher from reservoirs and lakes whose catchment areas were rich in peatlands or managed forests, and from eutrophied lakes in comparison to oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites. However, all these sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. The pelagic CH4 emissions were generally lower than those from the littoral zone. The fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were negligible in the pelagic regions, apparently due to low nitrate inputs and/or low nitrification activity. However, the littoral zone, acting as a buffer for leached nitrogen, did release N2O. Anthropogenic disturbances of boreal lakes, such as increasing eutrophication, can change the aquatic greenhouse gas balance, but also the gas exchange in the littoral zone should be included in any assessment of the overall effect. It seems that autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources, which contribute to the CH4 and Co-2 production in lakes, also have importance in the greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs.

Mobility, subsistence, and technological strategies of early Holocene hunter-gatherers in the Bolivian Altiplano	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					81st Annual Meeting of the Society-for-American-Archaeology	2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Amer Archaeol				The Altiplano constitutes the most extensive, high-elevation terrain in South America. Most archaeological research on the earliest human occupation of this region in the Bolivian Andes derives from sites such as Viscachani where the emphasis has been on typological comparisons of projectile points, rather than on complete and radiometrically dated assemblages. In this paper, we present survey and excavation data from the Iroco region in the Central Altiplano of Bolivia to address questions related to the adaptive strategies engaged by Archaic Period highland foragers. Specifically, we focus on the nature of mobility, subsistence, and technological strategies, stemmed from principles in human behavioral ecology. Based on data from radiocarbon dates, lithic, and faunal analyses, we suggest that, similar to other mobile foraging societies in arid environments, highland foragers in Iroco engaged in seasonal residential mobility, consumed a broad range of faunal resources, and developed a curated technological toolkit within the context of ameliorated environmental conditions that prevailed during the early Holocene (11,500-8000 cal BP).

Anthropogenic climate change has altered lake state in the Sierra Nevada (California, USA)	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climatic changes threaten freshwater resources and aquatic ecosystem health in the Sierra Nevada (California, USA), which has important consequences for millions of people and the world's fifth largest economy. However, the timing and magnitude of ecological changes driven by hydroclimate oscillations remain poorly understood in California's headwater region. Here, we develop a precisely dated, annually to decadally resolved lake sediment record of ecological change from the eastern Sierra Nevada that spans the last three millennia. Diatom paleoecology reveals a detailed history of abrupt limnologic transitions, best explained by modifications in water column stratification, mixing, and nutrient status in response to changing seasonality. Seasonally stratified conditions were registered during the Late Holocene Dry Period and the Medieval Climate Anomaly, illustrating the sensitivity of fossil diatoms to well-known periods of drought. Yet the most striking feature of the record is the uniqueness of similar to 1840-2016 CE: a period of singularly strong water column stratification, increased algal diversity, and reduced diatom productivity consistent with unprecedented "hot droughts." The data demonstrate that hot-dry conditions of the Industrial Era altered lake state to conditions unseen in the past similar to 3180 years, and suggest that regional trends identified by historical monitoring began far earlier than previously recognized. Our record illustrates the profound influence of anthropogenic climate warming on high-elevation lakes and the ecosystem services they provide in the Sierra Nevada, which hold implications for water quality and availability in California.					; Zimmerman, Susan/A-3351-2013; McGlue, Michael/C-9752-2014	Stone, Jeffery/0000-0002-1313-0643; McGlue, Michael/0000-0002-0725-7250; Streib, Laura/0000-0002-1236-4659; Yeager, Kevin/0000-0001-6213-0060; Zimmerman, Susan/0000-0002-1320-1878; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2021	27	23					6059	6070		10.1111/gcb.15843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15843		SEP 2021						34495571					WOS:000695402900001
J	Lantz, NJ; Wang, JF				Lantz, Nicholas J.; Wang, Jinfei			Object-based classification of Worldview-2 imagery for mapping invasive common reed, Phragmites australis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands provide many environmental and societal benefits. Unfortunately, the importance of wetlands has only recently been acknowledged after centuries of drainage and conversion to other land uses. An emerging threat to North American wetlands is the introduction of invasive plant species such as Phragmites australis, a reed introduced from Europe. Previous high spatial resolution satellite imagery used for mapping Phragmites was limited spectrally to four bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). A recently launched satellite, Worldview-2, has four additional spectral bands that may allow for more accurate mapping of Phragmites. In this study, a single-date Worldview-2 image was used to map wetland vegetation at Walpole Island, Canada. Object-based and per-pixel maximum likelihood classifications were performed on a four-band subset simulating traditional multispectral imagery and the full eight-band set of Worldview-2. The overall classification accuracy of 94.0% achieved for the eight-band object-based method was the highest of the four classifications methods used. The accuracy achieved by the eight-band object-based classification shows that single-date Worldview-2 image is promising for distinguishing Phragmites from native wetland plant species late in the growing season in coastal Great Lakes wetlands.																			0703-8992	1712-7971				AUG	2013	39	4					328	340		10.5589/m13-041	http://dx.doi.org/10.5589/m13-041													WOS:000328375100006
J	Fetahi, T; Schagerl, M; Mengistou, S				Fetahi, Tadesse; Schagerl, Michael; Mengistou, Seyoum			Key drivers for phytoplankton composition and biomass in an Ethiopian highland lake	LIMNOLOGICA												We studied the temporal phytoplankton community pattern of the deep crater Lake Hayq in the highlands of Ethiopia from October 2007 to October 2008. Earlier sporadic surveys indicated that the phytoplankton community was predominantly characterized by heavy diatoms, which characteristically suffer from rapid sedimentation. The trophic status of Lake Hayq was reported to have changed from oligotrophic to eutrophic in 1992. The present study addresses the potential reasons for the diatom dominance as well as causes of the trophic change. Net and integrated water samples were used for determination of physico-chemical parameters and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our results revealed that diatoms and chlorophytes dominated during most of the study period in Lake Hayq and seem to be favored by the mixing regime of the water body, which can be described as partial atelomixis with daily mixing of the epilimnion maintaining the algae within the euphotic depth via regular re-suspension. However, the epilimnion may be decoupled from the hypolimnion by a seasonal chemocline. Nutrients were not limiting in the lake with an overall mean concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus of 22 mu g L-1 and total phosphorus of 58 mu g L-1 and of dissolved inorganic nitrogen of 305 mu g L-1, with ammonium being the primary form. In the 1940s only diatoms were reported, but since the 1990s other phytoplankton groups and taxa have become relevant. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that chlorophytes were mainly associated with nutrients and rainfall, euglenophytes with elevated alkalinity and the diatoms with silica and zooplankton. Chlorophyll a as measure of total phytoplankton biomass was significantly influenced by seasonality and underwater light supply, reflecting the significant role of atelomixis in persistent occurrence of heavy taxa in the epilimnion. The lake is still categorized as a eutrophic system, demonstrating that the trophic change reported in 1992 was not short-lived. In addition to changes in the catchment the eutrophication process was probably primarily triggered by a previous introduction of Tilapia in the lake, causing a cascading effect in the food-web interactions. This implied that the phytoplankton composition and biomass of this tropical deep tropical lake can be controlled through biomanipulation, as has been demonstrated for temperate lakes.

Existing biogeochemical models require modifications and inclusion of hydrodynamic processes operative in shallow, warm waters to be applied to these aquatic ecosystems. We modified a 1-dimensional process-based, lake biogeochemical model and combined a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model to suit Amazon floodplains. We evaluated the combined model's performance simulating methane concentrations and fluxes and several related processes in the open lake and an embayment of a well-studied Amazon lake. Parameters for calibration were selected through sensitivity tests using a machine learning-based algorithm, classification, and regression trees. Comparison between simulated and measured fluxes indicate generally good agreement in seasonal patterns and magnitudes. Comparisons of near-surface concentrations varied with no clear patterns. Simulations of methane concentrations at near-surface and near-bottom, and diffusive emissions are most sensitive to carbon mineralization rate, Q10 factors for methanogenesis and oxidation, and methane oxidation potential. Modeled rates of planktonic photosynthesis were generally lower than measurements, though simulated planktonic respiration was often similar to measurements. Simulated rates of methane oxidation were considerably lower, with a few exceptions, than measurements of methane oxidation in oxic water of the lake. Improvements of results of the linked hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model will result from inclusion of advective transport, use of parameter values appropriate for tropical waters, especially for methane oxidation and photosynthesis, and addition of changes in hydrostatic pressure to model of ebullition. Methane emissions from lakes are large, highly variable and without adequate measurements, especially in tropical regions. The combination of mechanistic models with results from intensive field data provides one way to improve understanding of the processes and sources of variability. Riverine floodplain lakes, as occur in the Amazon basin, constitute extensive aquatic ecosystems and are important methane sources to the atmosphere. Though tropical lakes typically experience muted seasonal variations in climate, strong diel changes occur, and floodplain lakes have additional biogeochemical and ecological variability caused by changes in water level, connectivity to rivers and optical properties. We modified a one-dimensional process-based, lake biogeochemical model and combined a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model to be applicable to Amazon floodplains and similar shallow, warm waters. The combined model simulated well methane processes and fluxes based on evaluation using observations in a representative central Amazon floodplain lake with measurements of meteorological variables, water temperatures and ecological conditions, and methane emissions over the seasonal hydrological phases with large differences in water levels. Methane fluxes from Amazon floodplains lakes simulated with biogeochemical model combined with hydrodynamic modelSeasonal patterns and magnitudes of simulated and measured fluxes are generally in good agreementMethane concentrations and diffusive emissions are sensitive to carbon mineralization and methane production and oxidation					Guo, Mingyang/AAV-8580-2020; Amaral, João Henrique/AAC-4315-2022; Zhou, Wencai/ABB-4141-2022	Guo, Mingyang/0000-0002-3087-453X; Zhou, Wencai/0000-0002-9929-8702; Amaral, Joao Henrique/0000-0002-8992-6082														1942-2466				DEC	2023	15	12							e2022MS003385	10.1029/2022MS003385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003385													WOS:001129384100001
J	Koue, J				Koue, Jinichi			Modeling the Effects of River Inflow Dynamics on the Deep Layers of Lake Biwa, Japan	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Climate change-induced extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts and intense rainfall, exert a significant influence on river inflows. These inflows act as vital conduits for nutrient transport, water quality modulation, and the regulation of thermal dynamics in lakes and oceans. In this context, this study conducts a comprehensive examination of the multifaceted effects stemming from river water characteristics, snowmelt water influence, and shifts in precipitation patterns on the stratification dynamics of Lake Biwa in Japan. To facilitate these investigations, a hydrodynamic model was developed to simulate thermal stratification in Lake Biwa. The results demonstrate that an increase in precipitation and river water flow, specifically doubling these factors, leads to noticeable cooling of the lake's surface layer and a consequent destabilization of stratification during the stratification period. Conversely, halving these factors stabilizes stratification. Furthermore, elevating river water temperature by 5 degrees C raises water temperature near the upper thermocline, encouraging vertical mixing within the surface layer. Conversely, a 5 degrees C decrease induces significant temperature fluctuations and an unstable stratification extending from the surface to deeper layers. Notably, the spatial variance in water temperature within Lake Biwa is profoundly influenced by fluctuations in river water temperature. This study underscores the critical importance of considering river plumes in the study of material circulation, stratification dynamics, and ecological well-being in lakes and oceans. Given the mounting concerns related to eutrophication and the prevalence of anoxia in aquatic ecosystems, this research provides invaluable insights into assessing the impacts of river plumes on Lake Biwa's stratification structure and seasonal dynamics. center dot Extreme weather linked to climate change affects rivers, impacting lake ecosystems.center dot Precipitation and river flow changes can destabilize or stabilize lake stratification.center dot River temperature fluctuations greatly influence the stratification in Lake Biwa.

A late-glacial highstand in lake level gave way to an early-Holocene lowstand. This transition appears to have paralleled precessional changes that would have reduced insolation during the wet-season. The Occurrence of benthic/salt-tolerant diatoms and CaCO3 deposition suggest that the lake had lost much of its volume by c. 10,000 cal yr BP. Pronounced Holocene oscillations in lake level included a second phase of low lake level and heightened volatility lasting from c. 8300 to 5000 cal yr BP. While a polymictic take formed at c. 5000 cal yr BP. These relatively wet conditions were interrupted by a series of drier events, the most pronounced of which occurred at c. 750 cal yr BP. Paleolimnological changes in the Holocene were more rapid than those of either the last glacial maximum or the deglacial period. (C) 2008 University of Washington.

J	Allgaier, M; Grossart, HP				Allgaier, Martin; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Seasonal dynamics and phylogenetic diversity of free-living and particle-associated bacterial communities in four lakes in northeastern Germany	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The phylogenetic diversity and seasonal dynamics of free-living and particle-associated bacterial communities were investigated in the epilimnion of 4 lakes of the Mecklenburg Lake District, northeastern Germany. All lakes differed in their limnological features, ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic and dystrophic. Bacterial community structure and seasonal dynamics were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone libraries of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Communities of free-living and particle-associated bacteria greatly differed among the lakes. In addition, significant differences occurred between both bacterial fractions within each lake. Seasonal changes were more pronounced in free-living than in particle-associated bacterial communities. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses revealed several strong correlations between bacterial communities (both free-living and particle-associated) and environmental variables such as pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phytoplankton biomasses, and primary production. Phylogenetically, all cloned and sequenced 16S rRNA gene fragments belonged to already known freshwater clusters. Clone libraries of free-living bacteria were dominated by sequences of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria, whereas those of particle-associated bacteria predominantly consisted of Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes sequences. Other freshwater phyla such as Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and members of Candidate Division OP10 were found in low proportions. These differences may indicate an adaptation of distinct bacterioplankton communities to the respective environmental conditions of each lake.

There were five treatments : non-irrigated control, PRD, full irrigation [100 % of crop evapotranspiration (ETA and two levels of RDI (50 and 25 % ET,). Treatments started immediately after fruit set and continued until post-veraison. Soil and vine water status were apparently controlled not only by the amount of water but also by the irrigation strategy used. In the PRD treatments, soil moisture, leaf water potential, and transpiration rate were generally lower than in 100 % ET, but higher than non-irrigated and RDI treatments. Almost all treatments were different than in non-irrigated vines in fruit composition and wine sensory attributes. Wine sensory attributes differed considerably due to the amount of irrigation water applied in 2007. RDI strategies were more consistent than the PRO treatments in their effect on vine water status, grape composition and wine sensory profiles. Inconsistent patterns across seasons for some variables indicated that besides soil and vine water status, there were other factors that impacted vine physiology, yield components and berry composition. Conclusions: ROT treatments improved wine quality when compared with full or either non-irrigated treatments. Overall, use of ROT irrigation or PRO during dry and warm years can improve grape composition in cool climates. Significance and impact of the study: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of PRO and ROT on Cabernet-Sauvignon in a cool humid climate. It suggests that although RDI strategies are more effective, PRO also has value, particularly in dry seasons.

Limnogeology in Brazil's "forgotten wilderness": a synthesis from the large floodplain lakes of the Pantanal	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment records from floodplain lakes have a large and commonly untapped potential for inferring wetland response to global change. The Brazilian Pantanal is a vast, seasonally inundated savanna floodplain system controlled by the flood pulse of the Upper Paraguay River. Little is known, however, about how floodplain lakes within the Pantanal act as sedimentary basins, or what influence hydroclimatic variables exert on limnogeological processes. This knowledge gap was addressed through an actualistic analysis of three large, shallow (< 5 m) floodplain lakes in the western Pantanal: Lagoa Gaiva, Lagoa Mandior, and Baia Vermelha. The lakes are dilute (CO3 (2-) > Si4+ > Ca2+), mildly alkaline, freshwater systems, the chemistries and morphometrics of which evolve with seasonal flooding. Lake sills are bathymetric shoals marked by siliciclastic fans and marsh vegetation. Flows at the sills likely undergo seasonal reversals with the changing stage of the Upper Paraguay River. Deposition in deeper waters, typically encountered in proximity to margin-coincident topography, is dominated by reduced silty-clays with abundant siliceous microfossils and organic matter. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, plus hydrogen index measured on bulk organic matter, suggest that contributions from algae (including cyanobacteria) and other C-3-vegetation dominate in these environments. The presence of lotic sponge spicules, together with patterns of terrigenous sand deposition and geochemical indicators of productivity, points to the importance of the flood pulse for sediment and nutrient delivery to the lakes. Flood-pulse plumes, waves and bioturbation likewise affect the continuity of sedimentation. Short-lived radioisotopes indicate rates of 0.11-0.24 cm year(-1) at sites of uninterrupted deposition. A conceptual facies model, developed from insights gained from modern seasonal processes, can be used to predict limnogeological change when the lakes become isolated on the floodplain or during intervals associated with a strengthened flood pulse. Amplification of the seasonal cycle over longer time scales suggests carbonate, sandy lowstand fan and terrestrial organic matter deposition during arid periods, whereas deposition of lotic sponges, mixed aquatic organic matter, and highstand deltas characterizes wet intervals. The results hold substantial value for interpreting paleolimnological records from floodplain lakes linked to large tropical rivers with annual flooding cycles.

The combination of different primer pairs and nested PCR steps revealed an unexpectedly rich archaeal community. Overall, 140 samples were analyzed, yielding 169 different 16S rRNA gene sequences spread over 14 Crenarchaeota (109 sequences) and six Euryarchaeota phylogenetic clusters. Most of the Crenarchaeota (98% of the total crenarchaeotal sequences) affiliated within the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeota Group (MCG) and were related to both marine and freshwater phylotypes. Euryarchaeota mainly grouped within the Deep Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeota (DHVE) cluster (80% of the euryarchaeotal sequences) and the remaining 20% distributed into three less abundant taxa, most of them composed of soil and sediment clones. The largest fraction of phylotypes from the two archaeal kingdoms (79% of the Crenarchaeota and 54% of the Euryarchaeota) was retrieved from the anoxic hypolimnion, indicating that these cold and sulfide-rich waters constitute an unexplored source of archaeal richness. The taxon rank-frequency distribution showed two abundant taxa (MCG and DHVE) that persisted in the water column through seasons, plus several rare ones that were only detected occasionally. Differences in richness distribution and seasonality were observed, but no clear correlations were obtained when multivariate statistical analyses were carried out.

Therefore, guidance on how to obtain reliable datasets and select suitable step sizes for different geological media are of great importance. Here we apply this efficient analytical method to loess, stalagmite, and tridacna samples. The results show that 11 elements (Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Rb, Sr, Zr, and Ba), eight elements (Ca, Si, K, Fe, Cu, Ni, Sc, and Sr) and seven elements (Ca, Sr, Cu, Fe, Sc, Ni, and Si) can be robustly detected by this method for loess, stalagmite and tridacna archives respectively, demonstrating the capacity to reconstruct high-resolution paleoclimate changes. For loess cores, efficiency emission decay of the X-ray tube, water content, matrix, and grain size effects are the main factors influencing elemental intensities. The efficiency emission decay of the X-ray tube, scanning path, scanning interval, and radiation area have a significant effect on element intensities of stalagmite and tridacna samples. Based on our investigations, we suggest optimal resolutions for scanning these three archives for millennial to seasonal-scale paleoclimatic reconstructions. We compare our analyses with existing results from traditional (discrete) analyses, demonstrating similar scales of variability. Our results suggest that geochemical proxies measured by XRF scanning, such as Rb/Sr, Zr/Rb, and Ca/Ti ratios of loess and the Sr/Ca ratio of speleothem and tridacna, can be effectively used to reconstruct high-resolution paleoclimate changes.

In this study, we focused on the Ganjing River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, China. Common organisms were sampled and measured for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, and the relative contributions of different food sources were combined to construct the food web, so as to realize the influence of water-level fluctuation on aquatic food web. Our results showed that basal food sources for fish consumers were endogenous carbon sources such as POM, zooplankton and zoobenthos in the dry season, while high water level exposed fish to more diverse and abundant food sources, and the contribution proportions of exogenous carbon sources (e.g., terrestrial detritus) to consumers increased in the wet season. In parallel, the abundance and species diversity of fish were higher than those in the dry season. Most fish species had relatively higher trophic levels in the dry season compared to the wet season, because the increase in fish densities led to an increase in piscivores fish. The food web was composed of planktonic and benthic food chains in the dry season. During the wet season, the planktonic food chain was dominant, followed by the herbivorous food chain, and the benthic food chain was relatively less important. Therefore, water-level fluctuation may alter the trophic linkages within fish communities, which contributed to a more complex and interconnected food web. Moreover, as we expect, the stable isotope analysis food web was broadly in line with the gut content analysis food web.

The aim of this study was to explore the seasonal variation in phosphorus (P) speciation and bacterial community structure in sediments of Qin Lake (Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China) associated with the growth of submerged macrophyte Vallisneria natans. The differences in sediment bacterial diversity and community structure between V. natans growing and control areas were analyzed over a period of one year. The results showed that V. natans growth reduced the total P and organic matter contents of the sediments and increased the bioavailable iron (Fe) and Fe-bound P contents. The alpha-diversity of sediment bacteria was significantly higher in the presence of V. natans than in the controls during the vigorous plant growth stage. In the presence of V. natans, there was a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria and lower relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria. The Fe(II) content in the sediment had a larger influence on the spatial distribution of bacterial communities than sediment Fe-bound P, organic matter, and Fe(II) contents. V. natans growth could reshape sediment bacterial community structure in the shallow lake, which, in turn, enhanced P immobilization in the sediments and thereby improved the water quality.

The reservoir is relatively small and is mainly used for drinking water abstraction. Its present mesotrophic condition is threatened by increasing point and diffuse pollution loads, through population growth and agricultural and industrial expansions. The monthly water budget terms over 2010-2012 indicate a dominant, though gradually decreasing input via the different rivers and tributaries and an increasing contribution through groundwater inflows. Unaccounted-for terms in the water budget were estimated at ca. 10 %. Annual phosphorus budgets were used to derive the net P sediment-water exchange terms. These amounted to about 30 % of the annual P inlet, as a P accumulation into the sediment of the reservoir; no seasonal trends were observed. Considering the main geochemical characteristics of the basin, much of the sediment phosphorus binding will take place by Al-Mn-Fe minerals and oxyhydroxides. In this respect, possible large reductions in the water oxygen contents might likely trigger P releases from the sediment, which require further water management to mitigate impact.

Recent palaeolimnological change recorded in Lake Xiaolongwan, northeast China: Climatic versus anthropogenic forcing	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Lake Xiaolongwan is a closed maar lake located in the Long Gang Volcanic Field, northeast China. Core XLW2 was collected in 2007 from the central region of the lake and provides a palaeoecological reconstruction over the past ca. 130 years (dated using radiometric methods: Pb-210 and Cs-137). Diatom floristic changes and catchment productivity (carbon isotope ratios) were analysed within the core. Indicators of atmospheric pollution (XRF and SCP inventories) were also measured. Results show a marked transition from a dominant benthic assemblage to a planktonic one (increasing P:B ratios) starting after ca. 1940 AD, becoming most prominent after ca. 1980 AD (P:B > 1). Most notable floristic changes result from the increase in the planktonic species Discostella woltereckii. These changes are concomitant with increased temperature trends from the region and reconstructed temperature anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere. SCP concentrations and flux rates also increase after ca. 1950 AD, with highest values seen at ca. 1980 AD after which values decline. Normalised elemental geochemistry (e.g. Pb/Ti) also show marked changes after ca. 1970 AD, most likely derived from atmospheric deposition of Pb. The recent increase in D. woltereckii precedes anthropogenic contamination (Pb/Ti) at the site and persists after the decline in SCP concentrations. This suggests that the recent increases are driven by increased mean annual temperature trends. These temperature trends may be manifested as changes in ice cover persistence, a longer growing season and/or increased DOC at Lake Xiaolongwan: conditions for which planktonic species have a more competitive advantage.

J	Wang, XJ; Key, JR; Liu, YH				Wang, Xuanji; Key, Jeffrey R.; Liu, Yinghui			A thermodynamic model for estimating sea and lake ice thickness with optical satellite data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Sea ice is a very important indicator and an effective modulator of regional and global climate change. Current remote sensing techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor the cryosphere routinely with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we introduce a thermodynamic model to estimate sea and lake ice thickness with optical (visible, near-infrared, and infrared) satellite data. Comparisons of nighttime ice thickness retrievals to ice thickness measurements from upward looking submarine sonar show that this thermodynamic model is capable of retrieving ice thickness up to 2.8 m. The mean absolute error is 0.18 m for samples with a mean ice thickness of 1.62 m, i.e., an 11% mean absolute error. Comparisons with in situ Canadian stations and moored upward looking sonar measurements show similar results. Sensitivity studies indicate that the largest errors come from uncertainties in surface albedo and downward solar radiation flux estimates from satellite data, followed by uncertainties in snow depth and cloud fractional coverage. Due to the relatively large uncertainties in current satellite retrievals of surface albedo and surface downward shortwave radiation flux, the current model is not recommended for use with daytime data. For nighttime data, the model is capable of resolving regional and seasonal variations in ice thickness and is useful for climatological analysis.

As glacier melting accelerates under future climate warming, chemical release may also increase. This study investigated the behavior of semivolatile pesticides over the course of one year and predicted their behavior under two future climate change scenarios. Pesticides were quantified in air, lake water, glacial meltwater, and streamwater in the catchment of Lake Brewster, an alpine glacier-fed lake located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Two historic-use pesticides (endosulfan I and hexachlorobenzene) and three current-use pesticides (dacthal, triallate, and chlorpyrifos) were frequently found in both air and water samples from the catchment. Regression analysis indicated that the pesticide concentrations in glacial meltwater and lake water were strongly correlated. A multimedia environmental fate model was developed for these five chemicals in Brewster Lake. Modeling results indicated that seasonal lake ice cover melt, and varying contributions of input from glacial melt and streamwater, created pulses in pesticide concentrations in lake water. Under future climate scenarios, the concentration pulse was altered and glacial melt made a greater contribution (as mass flux) to pesticide input in the lake water.					; Steinlin, Christine/HGA-3424-2022; Davie-Martin, Cleo/AGJ-5787-2022	Cullen, Nicolas James/0000-0001-8877-1325; Davie-Martin, Cleo/0000-0002-3710-8715; Hageman, Kimberly/0000-0001-9187-5256; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 17	2017	51	20					11752	11760		10.1021/acs.est.7b03483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b03483								28925251					WOS:000413391800030

Surface sediment samples were collected at 6 sampling sites (3 sites from each of the 2 areas) on 15 February and 15 August 2009. Based on cluster analysis of the DGGE banding patterns, there were significant seasonal variations in the structure of the sediment bacterial community in the macrophyte- and algae-dominated areas, and site-specific variation within an area and between 2 areas. However, there were no significant between-area variations due to the large within-area variation. Analysis of DNA sequences showed that there were differences in the species composition of the sediment bacteria between the macrophyte- and algae-dominated area clone libraries. In the macrophy-tedominated area library, the bacterial community was dominated by Deltaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria. OP10 was found in the library of this area but not in the algae-dominated area library. The algae-dominated area library was dominated by Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Planctomycetes were found in this area library but not in the macrophyte-dominated area library. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that total phosphorus and water temperature were the dominant environmental factors affecting bacterial community composition in the sediment.

Though bias correction helps to adjust the climate model output to behave more similarly to observations, the hydrologic response still can be biased. This study uses Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to evaluate the hydrologic response of the trans-state Oologah Lake watershed to climate change by using both statistically and dynamically downscaled multiple climate projections. Simulated historical and projected climate data from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) and Bias-Corrected and Spatially Downscaled-Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 3 (BCSD-CMIP3) forced the hydrologic model. In addition, different river network upscaling methods are also compared for a higher VIC model performance. Evaluation and comparison shows the following the results. (1) From the hydrologic point of view, the dynamically downscaled NARCCAP projection performed better, most likely in capturing a larger portion of mesoscale-driven convective rainfall than the statistically downscaled CMIP3 projections; hence, the VIC model generated higher seasonal streamflow amplitudes that are closer to observations. Additionally, the statistically downscaled GCMs are less likely to capture the hydrological simulation probably due to missing integration of climate variables of wind, solar radiation and others, even though their precipitation and temperature are bias corrected to be more favorably than the NARCCAP simulations. (2) Future water availability (precipitation, runoff, and baseflow) in the watershed would increase annually by 3-4 %, suggested by both NARCCAP and BCSD-CMIP3. Temperature increases (2.5-3 degrees C) are much more consistent between the two types of climate projections both seasonally and annually. However, NARCCAP suggested 2-3 times higher seasonal variability of precipitation and other water fluxes than the BCSD-CMIP3 models. (3) The hydrologic performance could be used as a potential metric to comparatively differentiate climate models, since the land surface and atmosphere processes are considered integrally.					; Hong, Yang/D-5132-2009; McPherson, Renee/H-6256-2016	Shafer, Mark/0000-0002-8187-007X; Hong, Yang/0000-0001-8720-242X; McPherson, Renee/0000-0002-1497-9681													0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2014	28	10					3291	3305		10.1007/s11269-014-0678-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0678-z													WOS:000338651100035

In this study, we examine a 25 m-thick succession of Holocene age (core EM2) recovered in the innermost portion of the Po delta plain of northern Italy, applying an integrated palyno-stratigraphic approach. The existence of a paludal, freshwater setting inland of the line of maximum marine transgression favoured a low degree of pollen transportation. Application of cluster analysis to this palynological record leads to the identification of pollen-derived biomes and seven (auto)ecological groups of taxa that discriminate environmental signal (depositional facies) and regional climate conditions within a well-dated coastal record. Percentage variations of hygrophytes, aquatics and pasture-meadow herbs reveal local environmental dynamics, enabling the detailed facies characterisation of the cored succession, especially in terms of water table conditions. Framed into a chronologically constrained, high-resolution facies context, the proportion of montane taxa (climate degradation indicator) relative to Mediterranean taxa and Quercus + other deciduous trees (climate optimum indicators) highlight a vegetation-climate variability in the plain that fits with Bond events, especially for the early-mid Holocene (i.e., Preboreal and Boreal Oscillation, 8.2 ka event), supporting a strong Mediterranean-North Atlantic climate connection. For the first time, pollen from a continental succession of the Adriatic area clearly depicts the effects of the 8.2 ka cooling event on vegetation patterns (progressive degradation in high altitude communities) and depositional dynamics (increased fluvial activity), assessing the major role played by climate changes in shaping coastal landscapes in addition to glacio-eustatic variations.

However, based on the available literature, Mongolian inland waters appear to be characterised by a high biodiversity, including some taxa still waiting to be described. Novel data on the branchiopod, copepod, and ostracod crustaceans from central Mongolian steppe, from the "Tuul and "Umard goviin guveet-Khalhiin" hydrographical basins, are presented herein. While large branchiopods, some anomopod families, and copepods are well-represented in the collected samples, ostracods are rare, and the anornopod family Chydoridae is apparently absent in the sampled water bodies. The anomopod Macrothrix dadayi and the cydopoid Microcyclops afghanicus are here reported for the first time for the Mongolian fauna. Furthermore, two brandnopods (i.e. Maims sp. and Artemia sp.), three copepods (i.e. Diacyclops sp., Arctodiaptomus cf. alpinus, and Arctodiaptomus cf. wierzejskii), and one ostracod taxon (i.e. Heterocypris sp.), were not identified to species level and therefore deserve further study. The main ecological determinants of species distribution in the study area were examined using canonical multivariate analysis, which explained around 40% of total variation of the species similarity matrix; the main environmental drivers of crustacean assemblages in the study area were elevation, water turbidity, water temperature and electrical conductivity. The ecological preferences of crustacean species in the area are briefly discussed.

Absolute counts of roe deer populations (Capreolus capreolus) are not possible, but the rapid advancement of motion-sensitive camera technologies and new analytical approaches might potentially lead to more precise estimates at lower costs compared to traditional survey methods. We applied spatially explicit photographic capture-recapture models (SCR) in the Lake Geneva basin, Switzerland, from 25 April to 20 September 2018 to estimate roe deer densities in a pilot survey. We investigated the effect of survey duration and camera density on male roe deer density estimates to select the sampling design that produced density estimates with sufficient accuracy and precision at lower costs (i.e., material, fieldwork, data processing, and analyses). Males could be identified based on their antlers, which allowed us to apply SCR to estimate their density. Because females could not be identified individually, we inferred the overall roe deer density (adult and sub-adult roe deer) based on the sex ratio estimated from motion-sensitive camera photos. According to the results of sub-sampling simulations and by taking into account the financial costs associated with fieldwork and analyses, we conclude that 20 motion-sensitive cameras set over 20 nights (i.e., the 20/20 method) is a good compromise to provide reliable estimates of male roe deer density. Furthermore, studies estimating overall roe deer density using SCR and sex ratio estimates should be conducted from mid-August to the end of October just after rutting season and the peak of yearling dispersal, when the movement rates of males and females, and hence their detection probabilities, are similar and when males are still carrying their antlers. This approach was successfully applied in 4 selected study areas with contrasting roe deer management regimes, resulting in overall roe deer density estimates ranging from 3.9 +/- 1.3 (SE) deer/km(2) forest to 22.5 +/- 6.1 deer/km(2) forest. Our study provides a valuable and cost-effective approach using photographic SCR methodology and sex ratio information to calculate roe deer density estimates that can be used in management measures such as defining hunting quotas.					; Zimmermann, Fridolin/H-7877-2019; Christe, Philippe/X-4493-2018	Zimmermann, Fridolin/0000-0003-3861-246X; Christe, Philippe/0000-0002-8605-7002; Moreno, Ines/0000-0001-9150-1481; Hofmeister, Robin Joaquim/0000-0002-9965-595X													0022-541X	1937-2817				NOV	2022	86	8							e22307	10.1002/jwmg.22307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22307		SEP 2022											WOS:000849040800001

However, the information on the removal of various metals and metalloids in these systems is very limited. During the period 2002-2004 aboveground and belowground biomass of Phragmites australis (common reed) and Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) were sampled in three HF CWs in the Czech Republic. Concentrations of monitored elements in both aboveground and belowground plant tissues were similar to those found in plants growing in natural stands. The concentrations were much lower as compared to those found in plants growing in wetlands receiving acid mine drainage waters, waters from smelters or highway runoff. Concentrations decrease in the order of roots> rhizomes> leaves> stems. The leaf : stem concentration ratios were quite similar for all monitored elements ranging between 1.0 and 1.9. The root:leaf concentration ratio varied widely between 1.5 (Cu) and 54 (Cr) with a mean value of 20.0. Belowground/aboveground plant tissue concentration ratios varied from 2.2 (Cu) to 32 (Cr) with the average value of 9.9. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Freshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and thus its utilization for consumption, irrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over other commodities and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. However, there is growing recognition that functionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable services and long-term benefits to society. The short-term benefits include ecosystem goods and services, such as food supply, flood control, purification of human and industrial wastes, and habitat for plant and animal life-and these are costly, if, not impossible, to replace. Long-term benefits include the sustained provision of those goods and services, as well as the adaptive capacity of aquatic ecosystems to respond to future environmental alterations, such as climate change. Thus, maintenance of the processes and properties that support freshwater ecosystem integrity should be included in debates over sustainable water resource allocation. The purpose of this report is to explain how the integrity of freshwater ecosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow. Defining these requirements in a comprehensive but general manner provides a better foundation for their inclusion in current and future debates about allocation of water resources. In this way the needs of freshwater ecosystems can be legitimately recognized and addressed. We also recommend ways in which freshwater ecosystems can be protected, maintained, and restored. Freshwater ecosystem structure and function are tightly linked to the watershed or catchment of which they are a part. Because riverine networks, lakes, wetlands, and their connecting groundwaters, are literally the "sinks" into 'Which landscapes drain, they are greatly influenced by terrestrial processes, including many human uses or modifications of land and water. Freshwater ecosystems, whether lakes, wetlands, or rivers, have specific requirements in terms of quantity, quality, and seasonality of their water supplies. Sustainability normally requires these systems to fluctuate within a natural range of variation. Flow regime, sediment and organic matter inputs, thermal and light characteristics, chemical and nutrient characteristics, and biotic assemblages are fundamental defining attributes of freshwater ecosystems. These attributes impart relatively unique characteristics of productivity and biodiversity to each ecosystem. The natural range of variation in each of these attributes is critical to maintaining the integrity and dynamic potential of aquatic ecosystems; therefore, management should allow for dynamic change. Piecemeal approaches cannot solve the problems confronting freshwater ecosystems. Scientific definitions of the requirements to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystems are necessary but insufficient for establishing the appropriate distribution between societal and ecosystem water needs. For scientific knowledge to be implemented science must be connected to a political agenda for sustainable development. We offer these recommendations as. a beginning to redress how water is viewed and managed in the United States: (1) Frame national and regional water management policies to explicitly incorporate freshwater ecosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes and to the linking of water quality with water quantity; (2) Define water resources to include watersheds, so that freshwaters are viewed within a landscape, or systems context; (3) Increase communication and education across disciplines, especially among engineers, hydrologists, economists, and ecologists to facilitate an integrated view of freshwater resources; (4) Increase restoration efforts, using well-grounded ecological principles as guidelines; (5) Maintain and protect the remaining freshwater ecosystems that have high integrity; and (6) Recognize the dependence of human society on naturally functioning ecosystems.

We empirically evaluated this hypothesis using data from acoustic, midwater trawl, and bottom trawl sampling at eight Lake Superior sites during three seasons in 2005 and a subset of sites in 2006. We expected the larger-bodied cisco (Coregonus artedi) to exhibit a shallower DVM compared with the smaller-bodied kiyi (Coregonus kiyi). Although DVM of kiyi and cisco were consistent with expectations of DVM as a size-dependent, predator-mediated process, we found no relationship between siscowet density and the magnitude of DVM of either coregonid. Cisco appear to have a size refuge from siscowet predation. Kiyi and siscowet co-occur in demersal habitat > 150 in during the day, where visual predation is unlikely, suggesting predator avoidance is not a factor in the daytime distribution of kiyi. Seasonal patterns of kiyi DVM were consistent with reported DVM of their primary prey Mysis relicta. Our results suggest that consideration of nonvisual foraging, rather than light-based foraging theory (i.e., the antipredation window), is necessary to understand the processes driving DVM in deepwater systems.

A combined oxygen and silicon diatom isotope record of Late Quaternary change in Lake El'gygytgyn, North East Siberia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Determining the response of sites within the Arctic Circle to long-term climatic change remains an essential pre-requisite for assessing the susceptibility of these regions to future global warming and Arctic amplification. To date, existing records from North East Russia have demonstrated significant spatial variability across the region during the late Quaternary. Here we present diatom delta O-18 and delta Si-30 data from Lake El'gygytgyn, Russia, and suggest environmental changes that would have impacted across West Beringia from the Last Glacial Maximum to the modern day. In combination with other records, the results raise the potential for climatic teleconnections to exist between the region and sites in the North Atlantic. The presence of a series of 2-3 parts per thousand decreases in delta O-18(diatom) during both the Last Glacial and the Holocene indicates the sensitivity of the region to perturbations in the global climate system. Evidence of an unusually long Holocene thermal maximum from 11.4 ka BP to 7.6 ka BP is followed by a cooling trend through the remainder of the Holocene in response to changes in solar insolation. This is culminated over the last 900 years by a significant decrease in delta O-18(diatom) of 2.3 parts per thousand, which may be related to a strengthening and easterly shift of the Aleutian Low in addition to possible changes in precipitation seasonality.

J	Sun, ZB; Chang, NB; Chen, CF; Gao, W				Sun, Zhibin; Chang, Ni-Bin; Chen, Chi-Farn; Gao, Wei			Lake algal bloom monitoring via remote sensing with biomimetic and computational intelligence	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Traditional supervised classifications for remote sensing-based water quality monitoring count on a set of classifiers to retrieve features and improve their prediction accuracies based on ground truth samples. However, many existing feature extraction methods in remote sensing are unable to exhibit multiple-instance nonlinear spatial pattern recognition at scales via ensemble learning. This paper designed for lake algal bloom monitoring presents intelligent feature extraction for harmonizing local and global features via tensor flow-based ensemble learning with integrated biomimetic and computational intelligence. To explore such complexity, an Integrated Biomimetic and Ensemble Learning Algorithm (IBELA) was developed to synthesize the contribution from different classifiers associated with the biomimetic philosophy of integrated bands. It leads to strengthened multiple-instance spatial pattern recognition in lake algal bloom monitoring via image fusion at the decision level. With the implementation of IBELA, a case study of a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Managua, for water quality monitoring leads to demonstrate six input visual senses showing different impacts on retrieving Chl-a concentrations in the dry and wet season, respectively. The input of total nitrogen from the watershed plays the most important role in water quality variations in both seasons in a watershed-based food-water nexus. Although ultraviolet and microwave bands are important in the dry season, Secchi disk depth is critical in the wet season for water quality monitoring.

They can still be encountered in the African Sahel, where annual alternations of dry and wet seasons force them to continual mobility. Little is known about the genetic structure of these populations. We present here the population distribution of 312 hypervariable segment I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and 364 Y-short tandem repeat haplotypes in both farmer and pastoralist groups from the Lake Chad Basin and the West African Sahel. We show that the majority of pastoral populations (represented in the African Sahel by the Fulani nomads) fail to show significant departure from neutrality for mtDNA as evidenced by Fu's Fs statistics and exhibit lower levels of intrapopulation diversity measures for mtDNA when contrasted with farmers. These differences were not observed for the Y chromosome. Furthermore, analyses of molecular variance and population distributions of the mtDNA haplotypes show more heterogeneity in the sedentary groups than in the pastoralists. On the other hand, pastoralists retain a signature of a wide phylogenetic distance contributing to their male gene pool, whereas in at least some of the farmer populations, a founder effect and/or drift might have led to the presence of a single major lineage. Interestingly, these observations are in contrast with those recorded in Central Asia, where similar comparisons of farmer and pastoral groups have recently been carried out. We can conclude that in Africa, there have been no substantial mating exchanges between the Fulani pastoralists coming to the Lake Chad Basin from the West African Sahel and their farmer neighbors. At the same time, we suggest that the emergence of pastoralism might be an earlier and/or a demographically more important event than the introduction of sedentary agriculture, at least in this part of Africa.					; Cerny, Viktor/G-7842-2014; Soares, Pedro/G-9422-2011; Pereira, Luisa/H-3050-2011; Garofalo, Luisa/AAG-5710-2021; Podgorna, Eliska/G-8399-2014	Novelletto, Andrea/0000-0002-1146-7680; Garofalo, Luisa/0000-0002-3652-272X; Cerny, Viktor/0000-0003-1197-6634; Pereira, Luisa/0000-0002-4271-1527; Soares, Pedro/0000-0002-2807-690X; 													0737-4038					SEP	2011	28	9					2491	2500		10.1093/molbev/msr067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr067								21436121					WOS:000294552700011

The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation, evaporated mine water, and river water in Montana, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The isotopic composition of 42 samples of rain and snow collected in 2004 were used to construct a local meteoric water tine (LMWL) for Butte, Montana. The derived equation (delta D = 7.31 delta O-18 - 7.5, r(2) = 0.987), represents one of the first published LMWLs based on direct precipitation for any location in the northern Rocky Mountains. Samples of underground and surface mine waters in Butte, including the Berkeley pit-take and a nearby tailings pond, define a linear trend with a much lower slope and intercept than the LMWL (delta D = 5.00 delta O-18 - 49.5, r(2) = 0.991), consistent with non-equilibrium evaporation at an average relative humidity of roughly 65%. Detailed evaporation calculations are presented which indicate that the shallow Berkeley pit-take was approximately 25% evaporated in October, 2003, whereas the surface of the tailings pond was at least 50% evaporated. The intersection of the LMWL and mine water evaporation trend was used to calculate the average composition of recharge water to the flooded mine complex (delta D = -139 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = -18.0 parts per thousand). These values are considerably lighter than the weighted total of precipitation for the 2004 calendar year (delta D = -118 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = -15.37 parts per thousand), which is partly explained by the unusually tow snowfall that Montana experienced in 2004. Based on this study, the LMWL recently proposed by Kendall and Coplen (2001) [Kendall, C., Coplen, T.B., 2001. Distribution of oxygen-18 and deuterium in river waters across the United States, Hydrological Processes 15, 1363-1393] from regression of isotopic data from a number of Montana rivers is more accurately interpreted as an evaporation line. Isotopic trends based on river data should be treated with caution, particularly in a semi-arid region such as Montana where rivers are often influenced by dams and irrigation withdrawals.

However, the effects of water level management on the distribution and composition of aquatic vegetation has received little attention. Relevant studies have used either limited short-term or discrete long-term data and thus are either narrowly applicable or easily confounded by the effects of other environmental factors. We developed classification tree models using ground surveys combined with 52 remotely sensed images (15-30 m resolution) to map the distributions of two groups of aquatic vegetation in Taihu Lake, China from 1989-2010. Type 1 vegetation included emergent, floating, and floating-leaf plants, whereas Type 2 consisted of submerged vegetation. We sought to identify both inter-and intra-annual dynamics of water level and corresponding dynamics in the aquatic vegetation. Water levels in the ten-year period from 2000-2010 were 0.06-0.21 m lower from July to September (wet season) and 0.22-0.27 m higher from December to March (dry season) than in the 1989-1999 period. Average intra-annual variation (CVa) decreased from 10.21% in 1989-1999 to 5.41% in 2000-2010. The areas of both Type 1 and Type 2 vegetation increased substantially in 2000-2010 relative to 1989-1999. Neither annual average water level nor CVa influenced aquatic vegetation area, but water level from January to March had significant positive and negative correlations, respectively, with areas of Type 1 and Type 2 vegetation. Our findings revealed problems with the current management of water levels in Taihu Lake. To restore Taihu Lake to its original state of submerged vegetation dominance, water levels in the dry season should be lowered to better approximate natural conditions and reinstate the high variability (i.e., greater extremes) that was present historically.																			1932-6203					SEP 18	2012	7	9							e44836	10.1371/journal.pone.0044836	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044836								23028639					WOS:000311313900046

Because of its geographic position near the latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies and the strong influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the area is suitable for paleoecological and paleoclimate research. The island is not far north of the Subantarctic Front, which limits the northern boundary of the ACC. Paleoenvironmental study in this geographic location can shed light on past changes in atmospheric and marine circulation patterns. Diatom analysis of the lower part of a sediment sequence from Laguna Cascada (54A degrees 45' 51.3''S, 64A degrees 20' 20.07''W) enabled inference of changing lake conditions between 16 and 11.1 cal ka BP. Between 16 and 14.4 cal ka BP fragilarioid diatom species, often a pioneer group, dominated the record. Their presence shows seasonally open-water conditions from the onset of sedimentation. In zone II (14.4-12.8 cal ka BP), the dominance of planktonic/tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira spp. might represent longer ice-free periods and windier conditions, which would have kept this heavy species suspended in the water column. This period corresponds to the Antarctic Cold Reversal, when the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies were possibly centered on the latitudes of Tierra del Fuego, resulting in windy and wet conditions. Zone III (12.8-11.1 cal ka BP) is dominated by benthic diatom taxa that are mainly associated with peat and wetland vegetation. This suggests that climate conditions had become milder and less windy, favoring aquatic productivity and terrestrial vegetation development. This change in environmental conditions may have been a consequence of the southward movement of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies at the start of the Antarctic Holocene thermal optimum.

J	Terra, BD; Araújo, FG				Terra, Bianca de Freitas; Araujo, Francisco Gerson			A preliminary fish assemblage index for a transitional river-reservoir system in southeastern Brazil	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Large river-reservoir systems are some of the most difficult aquatic ecosystems to assess because: (1) they typically lack minimally disturbed reference sites; (2) the reservoirs are not natural systems to begin with; and (3) reservoirs with high exchange rates are transitional systems between rivers and lakes. These features are further complicated in Brazil where fish species taxonomy is incomplete (let alone fully described ecologically), where waters naturally have high organic and thermal loadings, and where dams and reservoirs provide most of the nation's electricity and water supplies. As a first step towards generating a biological tool for assessing the effects of reservoirs on rivers, we developed a preliminary River-Reservoir Fish Assemblage Index (RRFAI) in a transitional river-reservoir system in southeastern Brazil. To do so, we gill-netted fish monthly between October 2006 and September 2007 (excluding May and July 2007) immediately upriver of the reservoir, in the upper reservoir, in the lower reservoir, and immediately downriver of the reservoir. In developing our RRFAI we sought fish assemblage metrics to represent ecological characteristics including richness, habitat, trophic, tolerance, and resilience guilds. Despite clear differences in fish assemblage composition between river and reservoir sites, we found 9 metrics common to both systems that were nonredundant and had low sampling variability (number of native species, number of characiform species, number of siluriform species, % omnivorous individuals, % invertivorous individuals, % non-native carnivorous individuals, % intolerant individuals, % tolerant individuals, number of tolerant species). Fish assemblage condition was significantly and consistently lower in the lower reservoir. There was no significant difference between the dry and wet season in RRFAI scores, suggesting that a single season sample should usually suffice. Further research is needed along distinct disturbance gradients in multiple river-reservoir systems in Brazil to confirm the sensitivity of our preliminary RRFAI for assessing the physical and chemical habitat disturbances common to such systems.

Spatial and temporal variations in lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet provide temporary storage for meltwater that influences both the surface and basal water fluxes. Thus, to understand the effects of variations in surface melt on ice sheet dynamics it is necessary to understand the surface hydrology. We have used satellite imagery, acquired at 5-day intervals, to map lake initiation and cessation on two sub-sections on the south west Greenland Ice Sheet over three melt seasons (2007-2009). We observe that lake initiation is closely tied to a threshold energy input of approximately 40 +/- 18.5 positive-degree-days. This applies to all studied melt seasons, regardless of evolution and melting index anomalies. Lake longevity averages 24 days with little variation between different melt seasons. Our observed median lake area is larger than previously reported. Approximately 50% of all lakes have a life span of < 10 d. Cessation of identified lakes is caused by two processes: drainage during the melt season (88% - 2007, 78% - 2008 and 88% - 2009) and freeze-up at the end of the season (12% - 2007,22% - 2008 and 12% - 2009). Inclusion of the energy needed for lake initiation and number of lakes that freeze up at the end of the season into supra-glacial lake models will add further insight into the hydrological system dynamics.

Layers with high amounts of coarse, terrigenous ice-rafted debris (IRD) and often high contents of smectite were deposited during extensive glaciations in northern Eurasia, when ice sheets reached the northern continental margins of the Barents and Kara seas and discharged icebergs into the Arctic Ocean. Intercalated layers with relatively low IRD and smectite contents, but abundant planktic foraminifers in the coarse fraction were deposited during periods of Atlantic Water inflow to the Arctic Ocean and seasonally open waters (leads) in a sea ice cover with only few icebergs in the Arctic Ocean. High IRD contents in the sediments reflect the presence of ice sheets on the Kara and Barents seas shelves and the hinterland during the entire oxygen isotope stage 6 (ca 190 130 ka), in substage 5b (ca 90-80 ka), at the stage boundary 5/4 (around 75 ka), and in late stage 4/early stage 3 (ca 65-50 ka). These results are in excellent correlation with those from recent field work in northern Scandinavia, European Russia, Siberia, and on the shelves. Relatively low amounts of IRD in central Arctic Ocean sediments from the Late Weichselian glacial maximum (ca 24-18 ka) correlate well with the recent reconstruction of a very limited eastern ice sheet extension during this time. Oxygen and carbon isotope records of planktic foraminifers from the analyzed sediment cores show a number of prominent excursions which can be interpreted as evidence for freshwater events in the Arctic Ocean. The synchroneity of freshwater events and IRD input suggests a common source. Strongest events were associated with deglaciations of the Barents and Kara seas after the ice sheets had blocked the outflow of large rivers for several millennia. The outflow of freshwater from large ice-dammed lakes occurred at ca 130, 80-75, and 52 ka. Freshwater events in the central Arctic Ocean during the last deglaciation (ca 18 ka) were relatively small compared to the previous events. This indicates that during most of the Late Weichselian glacial maximum a river outflow from northern Siberia to the Arctic Ocean was possible. Atlantic Water inflow to the Arctic Ocean and seasonally open waters in the ice (leads) occurred during the interglacials of oxygen isotope stage 1 and substage 5e, during several interstadials (stage 3, substages 5a and 5c), and to a lesser degree within stadials and glacials (stages 2, 4, and 6). With the exception of the interglacials, these periods were times of strong ice growth on the continents as revealed by terrestrial data. The coincidence suggests that open waters in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas were an important moisture source (in addition to more southerly sources) which fostered the growth of ice sheets on northern Eurasia.

This study adapted the model for shallow polymictic lakes and developed a real-coded genetic algorithm to optimize key parameters identified by sensitivity analysis. Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake is taken as a study case, and 5 years data were collected for model calibration and validation. Given the good performance of the adapted and optimized SALMO, the model was applied to analyze four management scenarios for the Meiliang Bay, including 50% reduction of external nutrient loads, 50% reduction of internal nutrient loads, 50% reduction of zooplankton mortality and 1 degrees C increase of water temperature. The study showed: the adapted SALMO model is applicable to shallow polymictic and hypertrophic lakes; the real-coded genetic algorithm significantly improved the model efficiency and accuracy; reduction of nutrients from sediment release appears to be a key measure for controlling cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Taihu; biomanipulation is very delicate and can only be implemented with sufficient investigation and great caution; the increase of algae biomass due to water temperature rise indicates extra potential threat from climate change to lake ecosystems.

J	Farjalla, VF; Amado, AM; Suhett, AL; Meirelles-Pereira, F				Farjalla, Vinicius F.; Amado, Andre M.; Suhett, Albert L.; Meirelles-Pereira, Frederico			DOC removal paradigms in highly humic aquatic ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Dissolved humic substances (HS) usually comprise 50-80% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in aquatic ecosystems. From a trophic and biogeochemical perspective, HS has been considered to be highly refractory and is supposed to accumulate in the water. The upsurge of the microbial loop paradigm and the studies on HS photo-degradation into labile DOC gave rise to the belief that microbial processing of DOC should sustain aquatic food webs in humic waters. However, this has not been extensively supported by the literature, since most HS and their photo-products are often oxidized by microbes through respiration in most nutrient-poor humic waters. Here, we review basic concepts, classical studies, and recent data on bacterial and photo-degradation of DOC, comparing the rates of these processes in highly humic ecosystems and other aquatic ecosystems. We based our review on classical and recent findings from the fields of biogeochemistry and microbial ecology, highlighting some odd results from highly humic Brazilian tropical lagoons, which can reach up to 160 mg C L-1. Highly humic tropical lagoons showed proportionally lower bacterial production rates and higher bacterial respiration rates (i.e., lower bacterial growth efficiency) than other lakes. Zooplankton showed similar delta C-13 to microalgae but not to humic DOC in these highly humic lagoons. Thus, the data reviewed here do not support the microbial loop as an efficient matter transfer pathway in highly humic ecosystems, where it is supposed to play its major role. In addition, we found that some tropical humic ecosystems presented the highest potential DOC photo-chemical mineralization (PM) rates reported in the literature, exceeding up to threefold the rates reported for temperate humic ecosystems. We propose that these atypically high PM rates are the result of a joint effect of the seasonal dynamics of allochthonous humic DOC input to these ecosystems and the high sunlight incidence throughout the year. The sunlight action on DOC is positive to microbial consumption in these highly humic lagoons, but little support is given to the enhancement of bacterial growth efficiency, since the labile photo-chemical products are mostly respired by microbes in the nutrient-poor humic waters. HS may be an important source of energy for aquatic bacteria in humic waters, but it is probably not as important as a substrate to bacterial growth and to aquatic food webs, since HS consumption is mostly channeled through microbial respiration. This especially seems to be the case of humic-rich, nutrient-poor ecosystems, where the microbial loop was supposed to play its major role. Highly humic ecosystems also present the highest PM rates reported in the literature. Finally, light and bacteria can cooperate in order to enhance total carbon degradation in highly humic aquatic ecosystems but with limited effects on aquatic food webs. More detailed studies using C- and N-stable isotope techniques and modeling approaches are needed to better understand the actual importance of HS to carbon cycling in highly humic waters.

Focus was put on the vertical distribution of the investigated populations and on differences between their respective cell fractions with apparent amino acid incorporation. On average, 66% of betaproteobacterial cells and 73% of their diversity could be attributed to four clades within three lineages that were further analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The numbers of bacteria from the R-BT subclade of the beta I lineage and from the PnecB subgroup of the beta II lineage were rather constant throughout the water column. In contrast, members of another subgroup of beta II (PnecC) and bacteria related to Methylophilus (beta IV) were particularly numerous in the oxygen-depleted zone. In general, only moderate seasonal changes in abundance were observed in the upper water layers, whereas there was a clear relationship between decreasing oxygen levels and the rise of bacteria from the PnecC and beta IV clades in deeper strata. On average, almost 80% of beta I bacteria, but < 15% of cells from the beta IV clade, showed amino acid incorporation. Our results suggest that the studied populations occupy distinct vertical and ecophysiological niches in Piburger See.					; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; 													1462-2912					AUG	2008	10	8					2074	2086		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01628.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01628.x								18430016					WOS:000257715500014
J	Graham, ND; Bouffard, D; Loizeau, JL				Graham, Neil D.; Bouffard, Damien; Loizeau, Jean-Luc			The influence of bottom boundary layer hydrodynamics on sediment focusing in a contaminated bay	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Understanding the dynamics and fate of particle bound contaminants is important for mitigating potential environmental, economic and health impacts linked to their presence. Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva (Switzerland), is contaminated due to the outfall and overflow from the wastewater treatment plant of the City of Lausanne. This study was designed to investigate the fate of particle-bound contaminants with the goal of providing a more complete picture of contaminant pathways within the bay and their potential spread to the main basin. This goal was achieved by investigating the sediment transport dynamics, using sediment traps and radionuclide tracers, and ascertaining how local bottom-boundary hydrodynamic conditions (temperature, turbidity, current velocity and direction) influence these dynamics. Results of the study indicated that sedimentation rates and lateral advections increased vertically with proximity to the lakebed and laterally with proximity to shore, indicating the presence of sediment focusing in the bay. Hydrodynamic measurements showed the persistent influence of a gyre within the bay, extending down to the lake bed, while just outside of the bay circulation was influenced by the seasonal patterns of the main basin. Calculated mean displacement distances in the bay indicated that suspended particles can travel similar to 3 km per month, which is 1.7 times the width of the Vidy Bay gyre. This results in a residence time of approximately 21 days for suspended particles, which is much greater than previously modelled results. The calculated mobility Shield parameter never exceeded the threshold shear stress needed for resuspension in deeper parts of the bay. In such, increased lateral advections to the bay are not likely due to local resuspension but rather external particle sources, such as main basin or shallow, littoral resuspensions. These external sources coupled with an increased residence time and decreased current velocity within the bay are the precipitating factors in sediment focusing. While the spread of contaminants from the bay may occur through the transport of fine suspended sediments in shallower zones of the bay (< 60 m) by longshore littoral currents, results suggest that particle-bound contaminants are likely to remain within the bay.

We conducted experiments with natural HNF communities taken from two distinct habitats, the meso-eutrophic Rimov Reservoir and the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Cep (South Bohemia). HNF communities from each habitat at distinct seasonal phases, a late April algal bloom and a late May clear water phase, were each fed 3 Limnohabitans strains of differing cell sizes. Water samples were prefiltered (5 mu m) to release natural HNF communities from zooplankton control and then amended with the Limnohabitans strains L. planktonicus II-D5 (medium sized, rod shaped), Limnohabitans sp. strain T6-5 (thin, long, curved rod), and Limnohabitans sp. strain 2KL-3 (large solenoid). Using temporal sampling and prey treatment, we determined HNF growth parameters such as doubling time, growth efficiency, and length of lag phase prior starting to exponential growth. All three Limnohabitans strains supported HNF growth but in significant prey-, site-, and season-dependent fashions. For instance, addition of the moderately large T6-5 strain yielded very rapid HNF growth with a short lag phase. In contrast, the curved morphology and larger cell size of strain 2KL-3 made this prey somewhat protected against grazing by smaller HNF, resulting in slower HNF growth and longer lag phases. These trends were particularly pronounced during the late May clear-water phase, which was dominated by smaller HNF cells. This may indicate a longer "adaptation time" for the flagellate communities toward the large prey size offered.					; Grujcic, Vesna/B-5976-2015; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Kasalicky, Vojtech/F-8578-2014; Grujčić, Vesna/B-5976-2015	Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Grujcic, Vesna/0000-0002-3322-599X; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2015	81	15					4993	5002		10.1128/AEM.00396-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00396-15								25979896					WOS:000357668600014

Branched GDGT source shift identification allows improved reconstruction of an 8,000-year warming trend on Sumatra	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers (brGDGTs) in sedimentary archives are increasingly used for paleotemperature reconstructions due to their strong correlation with mean annual air temperature. However, environmental factors can influence the brGDGT producing bacterial community, potentially affecting the brGDGT-temperature relationship and introducing fundamental errors in reconstructions. Here we assess the reliability of the methylation index of brGDGTs (MBT ' 5ME) in sediments as a paleotemperature proxy by tracking provenance differences based on brGDGT fractional abundances in a short lake core, two peat cores and surface soils on Sumatra (n = 333 in total). Then, we attempt to reconstruct the Holocene paleotemperatures on Sumatra using the two peat cores. Our results indicate distinct brGDGT and H-shaped brGDGT (H-GDGT) compositions in soil, lake and peat environments, suggesting production by different bacterial communities. We introduce a new index, the isomerization of H-GDGTs (IRH) that can distinguish between these environments. In an 11,000-year long peat core from Diatas, we find that brGDGT composition changes are dominated by bacterial community shifts rather than temperature changes. In contrast, a core from the nearby Padang peatland can be robustly used for a brGDGT-based paleotemperature reconstruction since there are no signs of past environmental or brGDGT source shifts. The results from Padang indicate a gradual warming trend over the past 8,000 years, consistent with climate model simulations and nearby sea surface temperature reconstructions. However, current MBT ' 5ME calibrations yield larger warming trends compared to simulations and other proxy studies, suggesting the need for tropical and/or peat-specific brGDGT temperature calibrations. Our findings demonstrate the importance of assessing environmental shifts and bacterial source community changes when employing brGDGT paleothermometry. The methodological framework outlined in this study can be used in future research for reliable down-core brGDGT temperature reconstructions. Our proxy reconstruction over the past 8,000 years offers novel insights into the Holocene temperature evolution from a region with low climate seasonality.					; Phua, Marcus/JAN-4142-2023; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Zhang, Qiong/KHE-2175-2024; Rifai, Hamdi/AGN-3777-2022	Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916; Phua, Marcus/0000-0001-8941-1647; Hallberg, Petter Lars/0000-0002-7799-8871; Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Jarne-Bueno, Guillermo/0009-0004-9921-8735; 													0146-6380	1873-5290				DEC	2023	186								104702	10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104702		NOV 2023											WOS:001111774300001

Sulfur Species, Bonding Environment, and Metal Mobilization in Mining-Impacted Lake Sediments: Column Experiments Replicating Seasonal Anoxia and Deposition of Algal Detritus	MINERALS												The oxidation state of sulfur [S] is a primary control on mobility of metals in sediments impacted by legacy mining practices. Coeur d'Alene Lake of northern Idaho, USA, has been impacted by upstream legacy mining practices that deposited an estimated 75 Mt of metal(loid)- and S-rich sediments into the lake. Future lake conditions are expected to include algal blooms, which may alter S and metal remobilization during the seasonal euxinic environment. Cores of the lake sediments were exposed to anoxic and anoxic + algal detritus conditions for eight weeks at 4.5 degrees C through introduction of a N-2 atmosphere and addition of algal detritus. At a location 2.5 cm below the sediment-water interface, anoxic conditions promoted a shift in S species to continually larger concentrations of reduced species and an associated shift in the bonding environment reflective of increased S-metal bonds. Anoxic + algal detritus conditions suppressed the increasing trend of reduced S species and induced greater release of Mn compared to the anoxic-only conditions but did not appear to enhance the release of As, Cd, or Fe. The addition of algal detritus to the sediment-water interface of these Fe- and S-rich sediments enhanced mobilization of Mn likely because of dissimilatory metal reduction where the anaerobic oxidation of the algal detritus stimulated Mn reduction. Results of the study indicate that future metal release from the lake sediments will be altered with the likely deposition of algal detritus, but the effect may not enhance the release of acutely toxic metals, such as As or Cd, or substantially impact Fe cycling in the sediments.

J	Li, Q; Wang, GQ; Tan, ZX; Wang, HQ				Li, Qing; Wang, Guoqiang; Tan, Zhongxin; Wang, Hongqi			Succession of phytoplankton in a shallow lake under the alternating influence of runoff and reverse water transfer	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Both runoff and water diversion can interfere with the physical and chemical environment of a lake and affect aquatic organisms. In this study, previously obtained data were used to analyze the phytoplankton community, water quality, water level, and temperature in Dongping Lake (DPH) before, during, and after the water diversion caused by the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The results showed that the total density and diversity index of phytoplankton decreased in the water transfer period, and was related to low temperature. Temperature also affected the recovery of phytoplankton community structure when the water transfer period ended. In a water transfer cycle, changes in dominant genera were more drastic than that of a whole phytoplankton community, and dominant genera were sensitive to total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) changes. Water transfer alleviated the deterioration of water quality in DPH, but water transfer process increased the risk of water pollution. Runoff from Dawen River carried TN, TP, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) into DPH in the rainy season, which indirectly affected phytoplankton, while it also carried phytoplankton directly into DPH. Overall, these findings provide a clear understanding of the impact of water transfer projects on ecology in shallow lakes.					李, 庆/KHU-5504-2024; 王, 鸿麒/OEO-4528-2025														1998-9563	2224-7955				OCT	2020	51	5					1077	1090		10.2166/nh.2020.163	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2020.163													WOS:000589719000018

This study aimed to analyze the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) during wet season and dry season at Terengganu River in 2016. A total of 29 monitoring stations in the study area were selected and three water quality parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix methods. The DO ranged from 2.11 to 8.07 mg L-1, COD. rom 2.24 to 39 mg L-1 and BOD from 0.67 to 6.52 mg L-1 for the wet season while in dry season, DO rangedfrom 2.30 to 6.05 mg L-1, COD from 1.9 to 20.48 mg L-1 and BOD from 0.04 to 13.99 mg L-1. Spearman correlation test shows there was a weak correlation between DO and COD during wet season, while in the dry season, there was a weak correlation between DO COD and DO-BOD. This study also found out that urbanization and anthropogenic activities in the area can gave the more impact towards seasons and water quality deterioration in Terengganu River, Malaysia.

The aquaria were mostly inseminated with 10 juvenile worms and checked four times a year, changing the mud and eliminating the progeny, until the natural death of the original worms. Besides, mass cultures were kept in bigger aquaria. Many individuals of Tubifex tubifex, T. newaensis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, L. udekemianus, Ilyodrilus templetoni, Psammoryctides barbatus, Spirosperma ferox, Potamothrix moldaviensis, P. vejdovskyi, P. bavaricus, Stylodrilus heringianus and Rhynchelmis tetratheca survived for several years, reproduced repeatedly, and died out one by one during the observation period. In some cases, the most longevous individuals reached an age of up to 8 years (I. templetoni), 10-12 years (T. tubifex), 15-17 years (L. hoffmeisteri, P. barbatus, S. heringianus), or even more than 20 years ( L. udekemianus, S. ferox, T. newaensis). Criodrilus lacuum did not reproduce in aquaria, although the oldest individual spent 46 years there. Potamothrix hammoniensis, Lophochaeta ignota, Lamprodrilus isoporus, most naidines and some others did not thrive in aquaria and usually died without reproducing. In a cellar, where temperature conditions imitated seasonal fluctuations in lakes, or when the aquaria were maintained at continuously low temperature, the lifetime of worms was often longer than at room temperature. At elevated temperatures (+25 degrees to +35 degrees C) T. tubifex and L. hoffmeisteri formed cocoons mostly with only 1-2 eggs while their life span was then shorter. Architomic clones of Potamothrix bedoti, Bothrioneurum vejdovskyanum, Aulodrilus pluriseta and A. japonicus survived and propagated for years. The architomic Lumbriculus variegatus was thriving only when fed, e. g., with yeast. Uniparental reproduction by parthenogenesis was observed in T. tubifex, L. hoffmeisteri and S. heringianus kept or reared single. Two special races(?) were noted both within T. tubifex and L. udekemianus.																			1178-9913		978-1-77670-869-7; 978-1-77670-870-3				2020	17						102	120		10.11646/zoosymposia.17.1.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zoosymposia.17.1.11													WOS:000538767600007

The effect of reconstruction works on planktonic bacterial diversity of a unique thermal lake revealed by cultivation, molecular cloning and next generation sequencing	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												The aim of this study was to gain detailed information about the diversity of planktonic bacterial communities of a worldwide special peat bedded natural thermal spa lake, and to reveal the effect of a lake wall reconstruction work. To compare the efficiency of different methods used for analyzing bacterial diversity, cultivation, molecular cloning and pyrosequencing were applied simultaneously. Despite the almost unchanged physical-chemical parameters and cell count values of lake water, remarkable differences were observed in the planktonic bacterial community structures during and after the reconstruction by all applied microbiological approaches. Rhodobacter sp. was found to be one of the most abundant community members during the works probably due to the sediment stirring effect of the reconstruction. Following the reconstruction higher diversity was detected than during the works by all approaches. Bacterial strains related to species Chryseobacterium and Exiguobacterium, furthermore sequences related to Arcobacter, Gemmobacter and MWH-UniP1 aquatic group were identified in the highest proportion at that time. Although the differences revealed by cultivation based and independent community structures were significant, only minor disparities were found by molecular cloning and next generation sequencing techniques.

J	Russell, IA				Russell, I. A.			Spatio-temporal variability of surface water quality parameters in a South African estuarine lake system	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Long-term (20+ years) water quality datasets for estuaries are rare, especially for smaller systems. Monitoring of salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity has been undertaken since 1991 in the intensively utilised, modified, and managed temporarily open/closed Touw Estuary and its associated three interconnected estuarine lakes, Eilandvlei, Langvlei and Rondevlei, of the Wilderness Lakes System, South Africa, a national park and Ramsar site. Spatial variability of salinity, pH and turbidity was pronounced in the Touw Estuary but largely absent in the lakes. Significant differences in median salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity occurred between lakes, with reverse salinity and pH gradients frequently occurring. Seasonal variability in temperature and dissolved oxygen occurred in all waterbodies. Significant long-term declines in salinity have occurred in the more inland lakes, with decreases in turbidity and pH also occurring in some waterbodies. Water chemistry of the Wilderness Lakes is changing from that of an estuarine to a lacustrine system. Both biological and physical features were driving water quality changes, including reductions in river inflow, reduced marine connectivity, constriction of flow between waterbodies, and declines in submerged plant biomass. Management actions are proposed relating specifically to addressing the apparent causes for water quality changes.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2013	38	1					53	66		10.2989/16085914.2012.742006	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2012.742006													WOS:000317575600004

Understanding the effects that learned responses to being captured have on subsequent recapture rates and associated abundance estimates is important for developing accurate descriptions of populations and communities. Although variation in the willingness of individual turtles to be trapped is commonly mentioned in the literature, few studies have experimentally tested learned trap avoidance (or fondness) in turtles. Aims. To determine whether turtles learn to avoid traps, whether repositioning traps will lead to increased capture rates, whether this effect varies among species, and whether such relocations yield more accurate depictions of community structure. Methods. We studied a community of turtles in a small lake in southeastern Kansas that included populations of red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans) and common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus). We trapped the lake for 35 consecutive days by using two concurrently deployed groups of traps. One group remained stationary for the duration of the study, whereas traps comprising the other group were moved to new locations on Day 14 and returned to their original locations on Day 28, thus dividing the trapping season into three periods. Key results. For both species, capture rates declined over time. However, traps in the moved group captured more T. s. elegans than did those in the stationary group during the second period and more S. odoratus during the third period. Traps in the moved group also had higher recapture rates in the second period. Population abundance estimates based on captures from the moved group, the stationary group, and the pool of all captures were similar for T. s. elegans, but for S. odoratus the stationary group of traps produced an abundance estimate much lower than those generated from the moved group and the pool of all captures. Conclusions. Both species exhibited learned avoidance of trap locations, but relocating traps had distinct effects on different species, and the accuracy of the observed community structure was improved by relocating traps. Implications. The movement patterns and catchability of individuals of different species within a community must be taken into consideration when developing trapping protocols. Even high-intensity trapping over a long period may not generate an accurate sample of the community if different species use the spatial environment in substantially different ways and learn to avoid trap locations.					; McKnight, Donald/AAL-1621-2020	Hollender, Ethan/0000-0001-7457-921X; 													1035-3712	1448-5494					2023	50	6			SI		465	474		10.1071/WR21061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR21061		AUG 2022											WOS:000842066400001

Over the years, increased industrial activities and urban growth along the rivers and lakes have resulted in increased load over the water bodies. In the present study, a comparison of characteristics of water quality with respect to heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb) and their interrelationships with some physiological parameters during different seasons of year 2010 has been made in the water bodies flowing through the two geographical regions, namely Garhwal and Kumaon regions of the Himalayan State of India. All observed values of Pb, 02 observation of the Cu, and 59 observations of Fe are found exceed with the WHO standard for drinking water; 83 observations of Pb, 110 observations of Cu, and 59 observations of Fe are found exceed with the Bureau of Indian Standards. However, none of the observation of Zn is found exceeding with the standard limit. Cu shows the highest concentration 7.30 mg/l among all observations and also its higher concentration in Kumaon rivers. All the metals show negative correlation with dissolved oxygen and pH. Fe in river Yamuna system and Zn in Kumaon rivers show significant temporal variations at 90 % level of significance (LOS). However, no significant temporal difference of remaining metals is observed even at 95 % LOS. All metals except Fe in river Yamuna system show very significant variation in spatial distribution in different river systems at 95 % LOS.					; Siddiqui, Nihal/X-4968-2019	Gautam, Ashutosh/0000-0003-2484-1130; Kansal, Ankur/0009-0001-9883-8631; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2013	185	3					2553	2563		10.1007/s10661-012-2730-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2730-x								22733038					WOS:000314033300041
J	Gartner, C; Cukier, J				Gartner, Candice; Cukier, Judith			Is tourism employment a sufficient mechanism for poverty reduction? A case study from Nkhata Bay, Malawi	CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM												Extensive attention has been paid to the magnitude and distribution of economic benefits derived from tourism employment by impoverished populations. However, less is known about how economic benefits, such as increased income, relate to poverty conditions at the intra-household level, particularly within the unique contexts of least developed countries. In this paper, we examine the relationship of tourism employment to poverty conditions in a lakeshore community in Malawi. First, we quantitatively compare employment and poverty conditions among the households of tourism employees with those of employees of non-tourism sectors. Secondly, we undertake a qualitative investigation into lodge employment, and its remuneration and fringe benefits from the perspectives of lodge owners and employees. Our findings of the former analysis reveal that while employees of the tourism sector experienced better working and monetary conditions, this group did not exhibit an improved status in other poverty conditions. The latter qualitative analysis shows that most tourism lodge owners adhered to labour standards of minimum wage, and voluntarily offered fringe benefits such as paying medical, funeral, and education expenses of lodge employees. However, despite this adherence to labour standards, there is little evidence that lodge employees and their households experience an improvement in poverty conditions.																			1368-3500	1747-7603					2012	15	6					545	562		10.1080/13683500.2011.629719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2011.629719													WOS:000306607200003

Seasonal changes in water quality and macrophytes and the impact of cattle on tropical floodplain waterholes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The present study indicates the critical role of hydrologic connectivity in floodplain waterholes in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. These waterbodies provide dry-season refugia for plants and animals, are a hotspot of productivity, and are a critical part in the subsistence economy of many remote Aboriginal communities. We examined seasonal changes in water quality and aquatic plant cover of floodplain waterholes, and related changes to variation of waterhole depth and visitation by livestock. The waterholes showed declining water quality through the dry season, which was exacerbated by more frequent cattle usage as conditions became progressively drier, which also increased turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Aquatic macrophyte biomass was highest in the early dry season, and declined as the dry season progressed. Remaining macrophytes were flushed out by the first wet-season flows, although they quickly re-establish later during the wet season. Waterholes of greater depth were more resistant to the effects of cattle disturbance, and seasonal flushing of the waterholes with wet-season flooding homogenised the water quality and increased plant cover of previously disparate waterholes. Therefore, maintaining high levels of connectivity between the river and its floodplain is vital for the persistence of these waterholes.

A number of sensitivity experiments have been carried out to investigate the influence of snow and ice parameters and of different complexity on the results. Simulation results are compared with observations from the Alaska Lake Ice and Snow Observatory Network. Adaptations of snow thermal and optical properties in FLake can largely improve accuracy of the results. Snow-to-ice transformation is important for HIGHTSI to calculate the total ice mass balance. The seasonal maximum ice depth is simulated in FLake with a bias of -0.04m and in HIGHTSI with no bias. Correlation coefficients between ice depth measurements and simulations are high (0.74 for FLake and 0.9 for HIGHTSI). The snow depth simulation can be improved by taking into account a variable snow density. Correlation coefficients for surface temperature are 0.72 for FLake and 0.81 for HIGHTSI. Overall, HIGHTSI gives slightly more accurate surface temperature than FLake probably due to the consideration of multiple snow and ice layers and the expensive iteration calculation procedure.

Pollen distribution along climatic and biogeographic gradients in northern Central America	HOLOCENE												Environmental reconstructions based on fossil pollen rely on the understanding of modern pollen distribution along climatic and biogeographic gradients. This study analyses the modern pollen spectra of Central America using three basic approaches: (1) the evaluation of using modern pollen spectra to differentiate the main vegetation types of the region, (2) the usage of non-linear regression to predict individual pollen abundances as a function of climate, and (3) the construction of pollen-climate transfer functions. Standard pollen analysis was carried out on mud-water interface samples from 81 lakes in the Yucatan Peninsula and adjacent mountains of Guatemala and Mexico. Detrended correspondence and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the biogeographic patterns revealed by this modern pollen data set. Non-parametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) regression was used to construct pollen-climate functional relationships. Five modern vegetation types were clearly identifiable through their associated pollen spectra: Pinus forest, Quercus forest, mountain mesophyllous forest, tropical rainforest, and tropical seasonal forest. The last group includes three subcategories (evergreen seasonal, tropical semi-deciduous, and tropical deciduous forests), which were not separable via this analysis. Precipitation and temperature trends were consistent and robust for at least 28 and 30 taxa, respectively, in the LOESS regression. While floristic patterns driven by temperature were clearly reflected by the pollen spectra, those driven by precipitation were less sharply defined. Nevertheless, pollen data from the study area offered good resolution to identify broad biogeographic patterns. Furthermore, individual taxa showed high predictability along precipitation and temperature gradients, allowing the theoretical construction of pollen-climate transfer functions. This study provided valuable tools for the interpretation of fossil pollen sequences from Central America.					; Cabrera, Kenneth/NFS-3630-2025; Perez, Liseth/AAO-6731-2020	Correa-Metrio, Alex/0000-0002-1278-2746; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Perez, Liseth/0000-0002-5256-3070; Bush, Mark/0000-0001-6894-8613; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2011	21	4					681	692		10.1177/0959683610391321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683610391321													WOS:000290946800013

Seasonal evolution of water contributions to discharge from a Greenland outlet glacier: insight from a new isotope-mixing model	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) subglacial hydrological system may undergo a seasonal evolution, with significant geophysical and biogeochemical implications. We present results from a new isotope-mixing model to quantify the relative contributions of surface snow, glacial ice and delayed flow to the bulk meltwater discharge from a small (similar to 5 km(2)) land-terminating GrIS outlet glacier during melt onset (May) and at peak melt (July). We use radioactive (Rn-222) and stable isotopes (O-18, deuterium) to differentiate the water source contributions. Atmospherically derived Be-7 further constrains meltwater transit time from the glacier surface to the ice margin. We show that (1) Rn-222 is a promising tracer for glacial waters stored at the bed and (2) a quantitative chemical mixing model can be constructed by combining Rn-222 and the stable water isotopes. Applying this model to the bulk subglacial outflow from our study area, we find a constant delayed-flow (stored) component from melt onset through peak melt. This component is diluted first by snowmelt and then by increasing glacial ice melt as the season progresses. Results from this pilot study are consistent with the hypothesis that subglacial drainage beneath land-terminating sections of the GrIS undergoes a seasonal evolution from a distributed to a channelized system.

J	Tedesco, M; Steiner, N				Tedesco, M.; Steiner, N.			In-situ multispectral and bathymetric measurements over a supraglacial lake in western Greenland using a remotely controlled watercraft	CRYOSPHERE												Supraglacial lakes form from meltwater on the Greenland ice sheet in topographic depressions on the surface, affecting both surface and sub-glacial processes. As the reflectance in the visible and near-infrared regions of a column of water is modulated by its height, retrieval techniques using spaceborne remote sensing data (e. g. Landsat, MODIS) have been proposed in the literature for the detection of lakes and estimation of their volume. These techniques require basic assumptions on the spectral properties of the water as well as the bottom of the lake, among other things. In this study, we report results obtained from the analysis of concurrent in-situ multi-spectral and depth measurements collected over a supraglacial lake during early July 2010 in West Greenland (Lake Olivia, 69 degrees 36'35 '' N, 49 degrees 29'40 '' W) and aim to assess some of the underlying hypotheses in remote sensing based bathymetric approaches. In particular, we focus our attention on the analysis of the lake bottom albedo and of the water attenuation coefficient. The analysis of in-situ data (collected by means of a remotely controlled boat equipped with a GPS, a sonar and a spectrometer) highlights the exponential trend of the water-leaving reflectance with lake depth. The values of the attenuation factor obtained from in-situ data are compared with those computed using approaches proposed in the literature. Also, the values of the lake bottom albedo from in-situ measurements are compared with those obtained from the analysis of reflectance of shallow waters. Finally, we quantify the error between in-situ measured and satellite-estimated lake depth values for the lake under study.

J	Roe, JH; Georges, A				Roe, John H.; Georges, Arthur			Heterogeneous wetland complexes, buffer zones, and travel corridors: Landscape management for freshwater reptiles	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												While the importance of nearby terrestrial habitats is gaining recognition in contemporary wetland management strategies, it is rarely recognized that different wetlands are often diverse in their functions of meeting the annual or life-cycle requirements of many species, and that migration between these wetlands is also critical. Using radio-telemetry, we examined terrestrial habitat use and movements of 53 eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis) in an area of southeast Australia characterized by spatially diverse and temporally variable wetlands. Male and female C. longicollis exhibited a high degree of dependence on terrestrial habitat, the majority (95%) of individuals using sites within 375 In of the wetland. Turtles also associated with more than one wetland, using permanent lakes during droughts and moving en masse to nearby temporary wetlands after flooding. Turtles used 2.4 +/- 0.1 (range = 1-5) wetlands separated by 427 +/- 62 (range = 401470) In and moved between these wetlands 2.6 +/- 0.3 (range = 0-12) times over the course of a year. A literature review revealed that several species of reptiles from diverse taxonomic groups move between wetlands separated by a mean minimum and maximum distance of 499-1518 m. A high proportion of studies attributed movements to seasonal migrations (55%) and periodic drought (37%). In such cases we argue that the different wetlands offer complimentary resources and that managing wetlands as isolated units, even with generous terrestrial buffer zones, would not likely conserve core habitats needed to maintain local abundance or persistence of populations over the long term. Core management units should instead reflect heterogeneous groups of wetlands together with terrestrial buffer zones and travel corridors between wetlands. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Water volume change in the lower Mekong from satellite altimetry and imagery data	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												We have analysed satellite altimetry data from the ERS-2, ENVISAT and Topex/Poseidon satellites to construct water level time-series over a 8 yr period (from 1996 April to 2004 April) over the lower Mekong river basin. The study area includes the Tonle Sap Lake, seasonally inundated areas and several branches of the hydrographic network of the Mekong delta. We found a very strong seasonal signal over the main river north of 13 degrees N, the Tonle Sap Lake and Tonle Sap river, with amplitudes reaching 8-10 m annually. We also found a clear interannual signal in altimetry-derived water level time-series. For example, year 1999 had weak floods (around 6 m amplitude), contrasting with year 2000 during which strong flood was noticed (around 10 m amplitude). Southwards, we also observed large seasonal fluctuations (2-3 m) over inundated floodplains, as identified using satellite imagery data from the SPOT-4 Vegetation instrument. Depending on the location, quite different annual amplitudes were observed, the closer to the Mekong mouth, the smaller the signal (less than 0.5 m seasonal amplitude). Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from the Vegetation instrument, we studied the seasonal extent of flood plains in the delta. Then combining the areal extent of floods with water levels estimated from the ERS-2/ENVISAT data, we computed maps of monthly surface water volume change over six successive years (1998-2003), the period of availability of the NDVI data. Averaged over the lower Mekong basin, this surface water volume change was then compared to the total (i.e. surface plus underground) water volume change inferred from the GRACE satellite. They exhibit in-phase fluctuations.

J	Marchant, R; Hooghiemstra, H				Marchant, R; Hooghiemstra, H			Rapid environmental change in African and South American tropics around 4000 years before present: a review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Palaeoecological data recording a pronounced environmental shift centred about 4000 years BP are presented from tropical Africa and South America. The environmental shift is particularly manifested as a change in the hydrological budget and vegetation within numerous swamp and lake catchments. The majority of sites in tropical Africa record a shift to drier environmental conditions that is in opposition to South America, where a shift to a wetter environment is generally recorded. The strength of between site signals varies from being relatively complacent to dramatic, in some cases reflective of whole-scale vegetation change. The magnitude of change is mainly dependent of the location of the site and the proxy under investigation. These ecosystem changes are likely to reflect changed precipitation regimes, increased evaporation, and or an extension/contraction of the dry season. This pronounced Holocene environmental shift is particularly interesting, as the marked changes within the tropics are either weakly recorded, or non-existent, at more extensively studied temperate latitudes and polar regions. The Climate mechanisms responsible for this shift are reviewed and a model developed to explain such a strong signal from the: tropical areas without associated changes at high latitudes, such as changes in polar ice-sheet extent. We propose changes in Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperature regime, and the establishment of El Nino conditions have imparted a direct influence on tropical Atlantic SST that could explain the rapid changes in terrestrial palaeoecological records. Other components of the terrestrial -ocean -atmosphere system are also likely to be important contributory factors in the environmental shift, in particular the large changes in land surface conditions could contribute to the climate shift. Given the scenario for tropical environmental change, to a degree independent from high latitudes, targeted areas of future research are indicated that incorporate development of climate and ecosystem modelling and palaeoenvironmental investigation with a tropical focus.

Zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions in Green Bay, Lake Michigan: Lower food web responses to biological invasions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As the largest freshwater estuary in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Green Bay, Lake Michigan (USA) is an important ecosystem presenting both challenges and opportunities for investigating changes in the face of multiple anthropogenic stressors. We collected new data from 2000 to 2007 to assess changes in lower food web interactions after establishment of invasive species (Bythotrephes longimanus and Morone americana in 1988 and Dreissena polymorpha in 1993) and nutrient reductions (1990s). Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and composition, as well as primary productivity and zooplankton community grazing rates, were determined along the previously well-studied trophic gradient from the shallow Lower bay to the stratified, open-water Middle bay. A clear trophic gradient still occurred during 2000-2007, with higher nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in Lower bay compared to Middle bay. Phytoplankton abundance and cyanobacteria dominance increased significantly compared to earlier studies. However, integrated primary productivity did not change significantly at either Lower or Middle bay. Zooplankton standing stock decreased in Lower bay, driven primarily by reductions of bosminids, chydorids, and cyclopoid copepods, but did not change in Middle bay. Zooplankton community grazing rates did not change significantly, but shifts in magnitude and seasonality of net phytoplankton growth rates are consistent with increased phytoplankton standing stocks. Changes in zooplankton composition indicate increased predation by invertebrates and decreased fish predation. Shifts in both bottom-up and top-down factors have occurred, with Lower and Middle bay regions more eutrophic and similar to each other as a result of changes in this highly productive Great Lakes embayment.

The model takes account of the role of dry lake beds as preferential source areas for dust emission. The occurrence of these preferential sources is determined by a water routing and storage model. The dust source scheme also explicitly takes into account the role of vegetation type as well as monthly vegetation cover. Dust transport is computed using assimilated winds for the years 1987-1990. Deposition of dust occurs through dry and wet deposition, where subcloud scavenging is calculated using assimilated precipitation fields. Comparison of simulated patterns of atmospheric dust loading with the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer satellite absorbing aerosol index shows that the model produces realistic results from daily to interannual timescales. The magnitude of dust deposition agrees well with sediment flux data from marine sites. Emission of submicron dust from preferential source areas are required for the computation of a realistic dust optical thickness. Sensitivity studies show that Asian dust source strengths are particularly sensitive to the seasonality of vegetation cover.					; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022; Heimann, Martin/H-7807-2016; Tegen, Ina/W-4299-2018	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; Coe, Michael/0000-0002-7470-0697; Heimann, Martin/0000-0001-6296-5113; Tegen, Ina/0000-0003-3700-3232; Kohfeld, Karen/0000-0001-7241-1624													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV	2002	107	D21							4576	10.1029/2001JD000963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD000963													WOS:000180860300028

The large-scale subsidence wetlands generated by underground coal mining in China have been increasingly used by large numbers of waterbirds, which remain understudied. We aimed to explore the role of non-random assembly in shaping the regional waterbird diversity in nonbreeding seasons, providing insights for the conservation. Location: The North China Plain. Methods: Taxonomic beta-diversity and functional beta-diversity (both multiple-site and pairwise) of the waterbird communities were quantified and decomposed into turnover (i.e. species replacement) and nestedness components (i.e. the poorer sites being subsets of the richer sites). Observed functional alpha-diversity and pairwise beta-diversity, as well as the two components, were compared with simulated means under random assembly processes in null models, which maintained the species richness, pairwise taxonomic dissimilarity, and its turnover and nestedness components as the observed. Results: The communities exhibited similar multiple-site taxonomic and functional beta-diversity, which were primarily contributed by taxonomic and functional turnover, respectively. The pairwise functional beta-diversity, as well as its turnover and nestedness components, was positively correlated with their taxonomic counterparts. The pairwise functional beta-diversity was higher than the taxonomic beta-diversity, with the former mainly reflecting nestedness of functional strategies and the latter reflecting species replacement. The observed functional alpha-diversities in most communities were lower, and most of the observed pairwise functional beta-diversities were higher than the simulated means in null models. Main conclusions: The above patterns suggest the existence of non-random assembly of the waterbird communities across the subsidence wetlands. To protect waterbirds in the subsidence wetlands, we suggest that most wetlands should be protected via increasing habitat diversity. Furthermore, considering the changing environmental conditions, changes in the multiple biodiversity metrics should be monitored to inform the ongoing management plans. conditions, changes in the multiple biodiversity metrics should be monitored to inform the ongoing management plans.

Base cation weathering is a process closely linked to key factors affecting catchment functioning, including water pathways, soil contact time, and catchment characteristics, particularly in silicate-dominated areas. However, common process-based weathering models are often calibrated and applied for individual soil profiles, which can cause problems when trying to extrapolate results to catchment scale and assess consequences for stream water and groundwater quality. Therefore, in this work, base cation export was instead modelled using a fully calibrated 3D hydrological model (Mike SHE) of a boreal catchment, which was expanded by adding a relatively simple but still reasonably flexible and versatile weathering module including the base cations Na, K, Mg, and Ca. The results were evaluated using a comprehensive dataset of water chemistry from groundwater and stream water in 14 nested sub-catchments, representing different catchment sizes and catchment characteristics. The strongest correlations with annual and seasonal observations were found for Ca (r = 0.89-0.93, p < 0.05), Mg (r = 0.90-0.95, p < 0.05), and Na (r = 0.80-0.89, p < 0.05). These strong correlations suggest that catchment hydrology and landscape properties primarily control weathering rates and stream dynamics of these solutes. Furthermore, catchment export of Mg, Ca, and K was strongly connected to travel times of discharging stream water (r = 0.78-0.83). Conversely, increasing Na export was linked to a reduced areal proportion of mires (r = -0.79). The results suggest that a significant part (-45%) of the catchment stream export came from deep-soil weathering sources (>2.5 m). These results have implications for terrestrial and aquatic water quality assessments. If deep soils are present, focusing mainly on the shallow soil could lead to misrepresentation of base cation availability and the acidification sensitivity of groundwater and water recipients such as streams and lakes.

High-resolution temperature sensing in the Dead Sea using fiber optics	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The thermal stratification of the Dead Sea was observed in high spatial and temporal resolution by means of fiber-optics temperature sensing. The aim of the research was to employ the novel high-resolution profiler in studying the dynamics of the thermal structure of the Dead Sea and the related processes including the investigation of the metalimnion fluctuations. The 18 cm resolution profiling system was placed vertically through the water column supported by a buoy 450 m from shore, from 2 m above to 53 m below the water surface (just above the local seafloor), covering the entire seasonal upper layer (the metalimnion had an average depth of approximate to 20 m). Temperature profiles were recorded every 5 min. The May to July 2012 data set allowed quantitative investigation of the thermal morphology dynamics, including objective definitions of key locations within the metalimnion based on the temperature depth profile and its first and second depth derivatives. Analysis of the fluctuation of the defined metalimnion locations showed strong anticorrelation to measured sea level fluctuations. The slope of the sea level versus metalimnion depth was found to be related to the density ratio of the upper layer and the underlying main water body, according to the prediction of a two-layer model. The heat content of the entire water column was calculated by integrating the temperature profiles. The vertically integrated apparent heat content was seen to vary by 50% in a few hours. These fluctuations were not correlated to the atmospheric heat fluxes, nor to the momentum transfer, but were highly correlated to the metalimnion and the sea level fluctuations (r=0.84). The instantaneous apparent heat flux was 3 orders of magnitude larger than that delivered by radiation, with no direct correlation to the frequency of radiation and wind in the lake. This suggests that the source of the momentary heat flux is lateral advection due to internal waves (with no direct relation to the diurnal cycle). In practice, it is shown that snap-shot profiles of the Dead Sea as obtained with standard thermal profilers will not represent the seasonal typical status in terms of heat content of the upper layer.

The Future of Cyanobacteria Toxicity in Estuaries Undergoing Pulsed Nutrient Inputs: A Case Study from Coastal Louisiana	WATER												Harmful cyanobacteria blooms (cyanoHABs) are a global phenomenon, especially in calm, warm, and nutrient-rich freshwater and estuarine systems. These blooms can produce various potent toxins responsible for animal poisoning and human health problems. Nutrient-rich freshwater pulsed into estuaries affects turbidity, water temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations and ratios at irregular intervals, creating a highly dynamic habitat. However, the underlying processes that lead to the selective development of cyanoHABs for certain species and the fate of their toxins are still uncertain. This paper draws upon the rich body of research available for one such system, the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary, Louisiana, to generate insights about future research directions in pulsed-nutrient-delivery estuaries. Toxin-producing cyanobacteria blooms in river-dominated Louisiana coastal ecosystems have already been documented at high concentrations, presenting a potential risk to human health as $2.4 billion worth of Louisiana's fish and shellfish are consumed by millions of people throughout the US every year. Recent studies have shown that the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary, just north of New Orleans, Louisiana has been experiencing cyanoHABs, likely connected to combinations of (a) high interannual variability in nutrient loading associated with seasonal and episodic rainfall, (b) the timing, duration, and magnitude of the flood-stage Mississippi River water diverted into the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary, and (c) saltwater inputs from tropical storms. It is expected that cyanoHABs will become more frequent in Louisiana with a warming climate and changes to the timing and magnitude of river water diverted into the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary, which will play a dominant role in the development of blooms in this region. More studies are needed to focus on the environmental conditions that control the succession or/and co-existence of different cyanobacteria species and their toxins, optimally culminating in a near-term forecasting tool since this information is critical for health agencies to mitigate or to provide early warnings. Toxin forecasts for pulsed-nutrient estuaries, including Lake Pontchartrain, could directly inform state and municipal health agencies on human exposure risks to upcoming cyanobacteria toxicity events by predicting cyanobacteria species shifts, potency, and toxin modality along the freshwater-to-marine continuum while also informing a longer-term projection on how the changing climate will impact the frequency and potency of such blooms.

This study investigated its effects on the multifaceted ecosystem services, including serving as a source of drinking and irrigation water and aquatic health through assessing fish diversity and characteristics. Analyses of 189 water samples from 21 sites revealed spatiotemporal variations in major ions contributing to lake water salinity. The study assessed water suitability for drinking and agriculture using the water quality index (WQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), sodium percent (Na%), and Kelly's ratio (KR). The WQI, ranging from 141 to 408, indicated that the lake water was unfit for drinking. In some seasons, such as the pre-monsoon period, the lake water was deemed unsuitable for irrigation due to high SAR values (18 +/- 4 g/L, average +/- standard deviation), consistently rising MH values exceeding 66 in all seasons and elevated sodium percentages surpassing 66% in both the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The KR remained acceptable (averaging 0.8 to 2.5) in all seasons. Fish health in highly saline conditions was assessed using data from interviews, focus group discussions, and fish sampling (1684 fish from 10 sites). Results depicted that high salt contamination severely impacted fish length and weight. The study found low richness (Simpson's biodiversity: 0.697 and Shannon Weaver: 1.51) and evenness (Pielou's index: 0.48) among the fish populations. Since 1998, Manchar Lake has seen a decline in fish varieties from 32 to 23, with changes in fish species' feeding habits. To improve lake water quality, the study recommends diverting saline water to the sea before and after the monsoon season while utilizing freshwater from alternative sources to fill any water deficit.

Earth Observation has the potential for developing cost-effective methods to monitor risk, with free and open data available at the global scale. In this study, we present the application of remote sensing observations to map flooded areas, using the Vembanad-Kol-Wetland system in the southwest of India as a case study. In August 2018, this region experienced an extremely heavy monsoon season, which caused once-in-a-century floods that led to nearly 500 deaths and the displacement of over a million people. We review the use of existing algorithms to map flooded areas in the Lake Vembanad region using the spectral reflectances of the green, red and near-infrared bands from the MSI sensor on board Sentinel-2. Although the MSI sensor has no cloud-penetrating capability, we show that the Modified Normalised Difference Water Index and the Automated Water Extraction Index can be used to generate flood maps from multi-spectral visible remote sensing observations to complement commonly used SAR-based techniques to enhance temporal coverage (from 12 to 5 days). We also show that local knowledge of paddy cultivation practices can be used to map the manoeuvring of water levels and exclude inundated paddy fields to improve the accuracy of flood maps in the study region. The flood mapping addressed here has the potential to become part of a solution package based on multi-spectral visible remote sensing with capabilities to simultaneously monitor water quality and risk of human pathogens in the environment, providing additional important services during natural disasters.					; Abdulaziz, Anas/AAI-5681-2020; George, Grinson/M-1484-2019	Kulk, Gemma/0000-0002-0224-7547; K S, ANAGHA/0000-0001-5117-6514; Menon N, Nandini/0000-0003-1132-0192; Abdulaziz, Anas/0000-0002-1396-3645; George, Grinson/0000-0002-0136-5445														2072-4292				NOV	2023	15	21							5139	10.3390/rs15215139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15215139													WOS:001100468300001

A better understanding of nutrient controls over phytoplankton is critical if the blooms are to be controlled. In the present study, we investigated the effects of nutrient addition on the growth of phytoplankton collected from Meiliang Bay (Station 1), Lake Center (Station 2), and Xukou Bay (Station 3) in July and September 2011. Cyanophyta was dominant in all water samples. Nevertheless, we observed higher proportions of other phyla and lower concentrations of microcystin-LR in September than in July. Further, Station 3 possessed many fewer Cyanophyta, but disproportionately higher concentrations of microcystin-LR than the other two stations. The overall phytoplankton biomass decreased in the order Station 1 > Station 2 > Station 3 and July > September. More interestingly, phosphorus-induced phytoplankton growth coincided with a distinct drop in particulate organic carbon (or nitrogen) to phosphorus ratio at Stations 2 and 3. By contrast, nitrogen, applied either alone or together with phosphorus, had negligible effect on phytoplankton growth. These results suggest that phytoplankton at Stations 2 and 3 were limited by phosphorus and no nutrient limitation occurred at Station 1. Therefore, nutrient limitation in Lake Taihu may be more dynamic and sporadic than previously thought and has implications for management of phytoplankton blooms.

The results show that the frequency of flood disasters in Yunnan Province was slightly higher than that of drought disasters, and disaster frequency has gradually increased over the past 620 years, especially after 1750 AD. The variations characteristics of the drought and flood index (DFI) have 2 similar to 10 year quasi-periodic signal in the east and west regions of the Yunling-Ailao Mountains, and they are consistent with the environmental records of tree rings and lacustrine deposits in the region. The DFD of the IM region may be influenced mainly by solar activity and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on a century scale, and frequent human activities enhance the impact of DFD, especially in the east region of the Yunling-Ailao Mountains. The results provide a method to further understand the mechanism and trends of drought and flood disasters in the monsoon region on a century scale.

Despite their scarcity, carbonates along with organic matter provide significant paleoenvironmental information about lake systems. This study focuses on the carbonates in Lake Chungara, their morphologies, distribution and origin deduced from the isotopic markers. These markers reflected changes in the water and the biomass between the onset of the Holocene and around 9.6 cal kyr BP. These changes are marked by general increases in TOC, TN, and TN-delta N-15(AIR), and by fluctuating values of TOC-delta C-13(VPDB) in its sediments and are probably related to major shifts in the lake surface/volume associated with rises in lake level. An increase in salinity around 10 cal kyr BP is thought to be linked to a short dry period, giving rise to the onset of carbonate production. The mid-Holocene arid period between 7.3 and 3.5 cal ka BP, with a maximum of aridity around 6.0 cal kyr BP, was deduced from delta O-18(VPDB) values in the endogenic carbonates. These results match the reconstructions in Lake Titicaca based on benthic diatoms and paleoshore levels. Offshore sediments mainly consist of a diatomaceous ooze, laminated in the lower half (Unit 1), and banded-massive with tephra layers in the upper half of the sequence (Unit 2). TOC-delta C-13(VPOB) and the C/N ratio confirm that phytoplankton was the main source of organic matter in these sediments. Shallower sediments (units 3 to 5) developed in platform and littoral settings, providing evidence of subaqueous macrophytes and, to a lesser extent, land plants. Carbonate content ranges between 0.1 and 6 wt.% in offshore settings (30 to 40 m water depth) and reaches the maximum values in the lower part of Unit 2. Carbonate minerals (low magnesium calcite and minor amounts of high magnesium calcite and aragonite) are scarce and are arranged in mm-thick layers, commonly forming cm-thick levels or bioclasts. Carbonate layers are made up of euhedral-to-subhedral spindle-shaped calcite crystals and, to a lesser extent, aragonite needles, all in the pm range. Aragonite spheroids coexist in littoral sediments with other carbonate shapes and charophyte remains, where carbonate reaches locally up to 20 wt.%. CO2 photosynthetic depletions related to seasonal phytoplankton blooms were responsible for the high frequency deposition of mm-thick carbonate layers. The average values for delta C-13(VPDB) in lake water, plankton and sediments of Lake Chungara (as organic matter or as carbonate) are around 15 parts per thousand higher than commonly reported values in other lakes. This C-13 enrichment is attributed to carbon assimilation from a DIC affected by methanogenesis, in which HCO3- is the dominant species. The delta C-13(VPDB) and delta O-18(VPDB) variations and their covariation in endogenic carbonates suggest that lake water volume and lake level increased along the Holocene. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Short-term manipulation of precipitation in Mongolian steppe shows vegetation influenced more by timing than amount of rainfall	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsHow does plant productivity and community composition in the mountain steppe of northern Mongolia respond to increased precipitation? Do these changes differ with the timing of precipitation? LocationMountain steppe at ecotone between steppe and taiga, Dalbay Valley, Lake Hovsgol International Long Term Ecological Research Site (ILTER), northern Mongolia (51 degrees 01.405N 100 degrees 45.600E). MethodsWe experimentally applied water, representing a 25% increase in growing season precipitation, to plots at the drier end of a topographic moisture gradient in mountain steppe vegetation. In one treatment, supplemental water was applied weekly for four growing seasons. A second treatment started in year 2, in which three times the weekly supplement of water was applied once every 3wk for three growing seasons. Vascular plant species presence and percentage cover were used to assess water treatment effects on forb and graminoid composition. Plant species biomass and percentage cover in year 4 was used to determine treatment effects on total productivity, and on the abundances of legumes, non-leguminous forbs and graminoids, separately. Lichen, litter and root biomass, plant available N, P and K, and seedling demography were also examined in year 4. ResultsWeekly watering changed the relative abundances of forbs and increased the total abundance of legumes and non-leguminous forbs measured either as percentage cover or biomass. The 3-wk watering treatment did not induce the same changes in forb composition or abundance of functional groups but produced less compositional change in graminoids compared to controls. Neither treatment increased total productivity. Three-week watering increased plant available P and decreased litter. Seedling emergence, survival and size increased with one or both watering treatments. ConclusionIn mountain steppe, precipitation increases will produce immediate changes in composition and abundance of forbs, including legumes, but not in graminoids or total productivity. The steppe is more responsive to regular incremental increases in precipitation than to less frequent, larger storms whose effect would be timing-dependent within the short, temperature-limited growing season. Longer term investigations need to be conducted to explore if further lagged responses to water addition occur.

J	Guérin, F; Abril, G				Guerin, Frederic; Abril, Gwenael			Significance of pelagic aerobic methane oxidation in the methane and carbon budget of a tropical reservoir	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] The Petit Saut Reservoir (French Guiana), flooded in 1994, has an anoxic and methane-rich (> 400 mu mol.L-1) hypolimnion and an oxycline located at around 5 meters depth. Waters passing through the turbines are enriched in CH4, which partly degasses downstream of the dam. Aerobic methane oxidation rates were measured in the waters of the reservoir epilimnion and, in river waters downstream of the dam, during the wet and dry seasons. A unique first order relationship between methane concentration (C-CH4) and aerobic methane oxidation rates (CH4-ox) was found for the reservoir and the river downstream of the dam (CH4-ox = 0.11 +/- 0.01 C-CH4 + 1.18 +/- 0.74) giving a specific CH4 oxidation rate of 0.11 +/- 0.01 h(-1). In the reservoir, depth-integrated methane oxidation rates were calculated from oxidation rates and the distributions of CH4 and oxygen and ranged between 11 +/- 6 and 310 +/- 132 mmol.m(-2).d(-1), consistent with the turbulent vertical flux from the hypolimnion (38-321 mmol.m(-2).d(-1)) and almost two orders of magnitude higher than the atmospheric fluxes (0.3 +/- 0.2-1.9 +/- 1.2 mmol. m(-2). d(-1)). The average integrated methane oxidation rate in the epilimnion given by these two independent methods is 100 +/- 80 mmol. m(-2). d(-1). Downstream of the dam, about 40% of the methane entering the river was oxidized (77 +/- 40 mmol. m(-2).d(-1)) and 50% was emitted to the atmosphere (98 +/- 28 mmol. m(-2). d(-1)). Our results show that total pelagic oxidation (67 +/- 64 Gg C-CH4.y(-1)) reduce atmospheric emissions by more than 85% for the whole lake-river system and that this process is responsible for more than 25% of total CO2 emissions from the whole reservoir-river system.

However, scaling up from a single EC tower to the landscape remains an open challenge. To address this, we used 63 site years of data to examine simulated annual and growing season sums of carbon fluxes from three paired land-cover type sites of corn, restored-prairie, and switchgrass ecosystems. This was also done across the landscape by modeling fluxes using different land-cover type input data. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach was used to model net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and gross primary production (GPP) at one paired site using environmental observations from the second site only. With a mean spatial separation of 11 km between paired sites, we were able to model annual sums of NEE, R-eco, and GPP with uncertainties of 20%, 22%, and 8%, respectively, relative to observation sums. When considering the growing season only, model uncertainties were 17%, 22%, and 9%, respectively for the three flux terms. We also show that ANN models can estimate sums of R-eco and GPP fluxes without needing the constraint of similar land-cover-type, with annual uncertainties of 12% and 10%. These results provide new insights to scaling up observations from one EC site beyond the footprint of the EC tower to multiple land-cover types across the landscape.

Decoupling of chemical and biological recovery from acidification in a montane lake, Vermont, USA	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Lakes in the northeast United States are recovering from acidification, but it is unclear if species assemblages will return to pre-acidification conditions, in light of new, interacting climate change pressure. This study explored the impact of past acidification on Beaver Pond, an acid-impaired lake in Vermont, USA. We analyzed long-term seasonal trends in water chemistry data collected by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation to assess the extent of acidification and subsequent chemical recovery since the beginning of the monitoring period (1985-present). Biological recovery in acidified waterbodies often lags chemical recovery, as changes in community composition occur at a slower rate. To assess both, we integrated analysis of long-term changes in lake physical and chemical characteristics (pH, dissolved organic carbon, Secchi depth, surface water temperature) with a paleolimnological analysis to analyze shifts in sediment diatom community composition and changes in sediment geochemistry in the past similar to 180 years. Long-term water chemistry analysis indicates that both pH and DOC concentration in Beaver Pond increased over the monitoring period, and that the greatest rate of increase for both variables occurred between 2001 and present. We identified shifts in sediment diatom assemblages from acid-sensitive taxa (D. stelligera, L. affinis) pre-acidification, to acid-tolerant taxa (Eunotia spp.) during acid deposition, and different acid-sensitive taxa (F. rhomboides, B. brebissonii) in the post-acidification recovery period. Together, paleolimnological and modern data in our study indicate that Beaver Pond is experiencing chemical and biological recovery from acid deposition, though diatom communities in the recovery period differ in composition from those in the lake prior to acidification.					; Heathcote, Adam/I-9253-2019; Morales, Ana/AAA-1654-2020	Heathcote, Adam/0000-0002-9633-9548; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2022	68	4					427	442		10.1007/s10933-022-00256-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-022-00256-7		AUG 2022											WOS:000836508300001

The total concentration of PLFA, an estimate of the microbial biomass, depended more on TP, a proxy for pelagic primary production, but not on dissolved organic carbon, a proxy for terrestrial organic carbon input. The composition of PLFAs varied considerably over time, demonstrating seasonal dynamics in microbial community composition. When PLFA profiles in all lakes and seasons are compared, community composition is more similar within season than within lakes.					; Steger, Kristin/F-4187-2014; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011	Premke, Katrin/0000-0001-6216-5386; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2011	56	2					725	733		10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0725	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.2.0725													WOS:000290677800027

In various freshwater lakes in East Africa MC-producing Microcystis has been reported to dominate the phytoplankton, however the regulation of MC production is poorly understood. From May 2007 to April 2008 the Microcystis abundance, the absolute and relative abundance of the mcyB genotype indicative of MC production and the MC concentrations were recorded monthly in five freshwater lakes in Uganda: (1) in a crater lake (Lake Saka), (2) in three shallow lakes (Lake Mburo, George, Edward), (3) in Lake Victoria (Murchison Bay, Napoleon Gulf). During the whole study period Microcystis was abundant or dominated the phytoplankton. In all samples mcyB-containing cells of Microcystis were found and on average comprised 20 +/- 2% (SE) of the total population. The proportion of the mcyB genotype differed significantly between the sampling sites, and while the highest mcyB proportions were recorded in Lake Saka (37 +/- 3%), the lowest proportion was recorded in Lake George (1.4 +/- 0.2%). Consequently Microcystis from Lake George had the lowest MC cell quotas (0.03-1.24 fg MC cell(-1)) and resulted in the lowest MC concentrations (0-0.5 mu g L-1) while Microcystis from Lake Saka consistently showed maximum MC cell quotas (14-144 fg cell(-1)) and the highest MC concentrations (0.5-10.2 mu g L-1). Over the whole study period the average MC content per Microcystis cell depended linearly on the proportion of the mcyB genotype of Microcystis. It is concluded that Microcystis populations differ consistently and independently of the season in mcyB genotype proportion between lakes resulting in population-specific differences in the average MC content per cell.

J	Tadonléké, RD				Tadonleke, Remy D.			Evidence of warming effects on phytoplankton productivity rates and their dependence on eutrophication status	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Using 31-yr data from measurements in a lake that has experienced change in eutrophication status, I showed that the effects of global warming on chlorophyll a (Chl a)-normalized maximum rates of photosynthesis (P-max : Chl a) may be positive, nonsignificant, or negative, depending on nutrient availability. The magnitude of P-max : Chl a change in response to warming showed hyperbolic relationships with phosphorus concentrations; it was positive and constant when total phosphorus (TP) in the lake water exceeded 22 mu g P L-1 (eutrophic conditions) but was negative when TP was lower (nutrient-poor conditions), indicating direct negative effects of warming on primary productivity (PP) under phosphorus scarcity. Vertically integrated PP responses corroborate those of P-max : Chl a. These data also showed long-term seasonal variations in the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to temperature. The observed hyperbolic curves strongly suggest that the "limiting-nutrient cell quota"-based mechanism reported so far only in laboratories (by studies analyzing temperature-nutrient effects on microalgal growth or photosynthesis) operates in nature and plays a key role in determining phytoplankton response to warming of waters. The present findings provide insight on how phytoplankton productivity may respond to future warming in lakes of differing eutrophication status.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2010	55	3					973	982		10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.0973	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.0973													WOS:000277650900002

Seasonal and interannual dynamics of polyphenols in Myriophyllum verticillatum and their allelopathic activity on Anabaena variabilis	AQUATIC BOTANY												In 4 successive years, we investigated the seasonal and interannual variability of the total polyphenolic pool and of the individual polyphenolic compounds in Myriophyllum verticillatum, as well as their allelopathic activity in a small eutrophic lake. We tested whether nutrient availability explained interannual and seasonal changes in the production of polyphenols. There were no strong interannual variations in plant tissue carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, while total phenolic compounds (TPC) significantly differed between years, especially in apical meristems (range: 38-122 mg g(-1) dry weight (DW)). Seasonal patterns, with maxima between May and July, changed between years. Partially confirming the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis sensu Bryant et al. [Bryant, J.P., Chapin III, F.S., Klein, D.R., 1983. Carbon/nutrient balance of boreal plants in relation to vertebrate herbivory. Oikos 40, 357-368], we found correlations between TPC and the C/N (carbon/nitrogen) ratio in some but not all years, especially in apical meristems. Plant tissue phosphorus content accounted also for the variability in TPC in some years. Crude extracts of apical meristems always inhibited the growth of Anabaena variabilis, used as a target cyanobacterium. Plant TPC concentration and allelopathic activity were significantly correlated in all years except in 2005. Bioassay-directed fractionation of M. verticillatum extracts coupled with LC-MS analyses of the respective fractions revealed several isomers of HHDP-di- and -tri-galloylglucose apparently responsible for the allelopathic effects. The individual active compounds revealed a more distinct seasonal pattern compared to the pool of phenolic compounds in M. verticillatum, with a clear maximum in May, the ecologically most relevant period for inhibitory effects of submerged macrophytes on phytoplankton.

Maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia americana), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) species found in this forest also comprise a substantial portion of the landscape in the northern Great Lakes region and area, and it has been hypothesized that forests of this age (60-80 years) are responsible for net uptake of atmospheric CO2 over North America. Mean CO,, water vapor, and temperature profile measurements were used to improve flux estimates during periods of low turbulence, and were effective for friction velocities (u(*)) >0.3 m s(-1). Unique observations at this site included nighttime and early morning venting anomalies that seemed to originate from a seemingly homogenous area within the forest. These elevated NEE measurements, some as high as 80 mol m- s, appeared in valid turbulent flux observations for hours at a time, and provided circumstantial evidence for preferential venting and/or existence of pooled CO2 in low-lying areas. We observed that the forest was a moderate sink for atmospheric carbon, and cumulative NEE of CO2 was estimated to be -334 g C m(-2) year(-1) during 2000. Sensitivity to low-turbulence flux corrections was very small (21 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and discrepancies between annual estimates of NEE and NEP were similar to other sites. A normalized measure of ecosystem respiration, the free energy of activation, was presented and its seasonal variations were analyzed. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was high (1165 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and ecosystem respiration (ER) was low (817 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in comparison to spatially integrated, landscape-scale observations from WLEF (914 and 1005 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively), a 477 m tower located 22 km to the northeast [Glob. Change Biol. 9 (2003) 1278]. Forest transpiration was responsible for most of the water released to the atmosphere. Stomata closed under intense sunlight and high vapor pressure deficits (VPD > 1.5 kPa). Effect of stomotal closure on annual CO2 uptake was minimal due to adequate soil moisture and moderate VPD during the growing season. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Feeding habits of 2 reef-associated fishes, red porgy (Pagrus pagrus) and gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus), off the southeastern United States	FISHERY BULLETIN												The feeding habits of red porgy (Pagrus pagrus) and gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) were investigated by examining the gut contents of specimens collected during 2009-2011 from live bottom habitats off the southeastern United States. Red porgy had a diverse diet of 188 different taxa. Decapods, barnacles, and bivalves were their main prey. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that depth, season, and fish length were statistically significant factors determining the degree of variability in the diet of red porgy. Gray triggerfish also had a diverse diet, composed of 131 different prey taxa. Barnacles, gastropods, and decapods were their main prey. Of the 4 explanatory variables, latitude was highly significant, and season, depth, and length were statistically significant. Red porgy and gray triggerfish were observed to have a generalized feeding strategy of feeding opportunistically on a wide range of prey. This study contains fundamental trophic data on 2 important fishery species in the southeastern United States. Most importantly, it provides fisheries managers with some of the data necessary for the implementation of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management.																			0090-0656	1937-4518				JUL	2016	114	3					317	329		10.7755/FB.114.3.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.7755/FB.114.3.5													WOS:000380185700005

During study, the water level in Lake Tomaszne were periodically regulated whereas in Lake Mytycze, the water level manipulation was not performed. We assumed that the supply with fertile waters and subsequent discharge can be reflected in seasonal changes of phytoplankton taxa composition and biomass, especially of toxigenic cyanobacteria. In Lake Tomaszne, the development of toxigenic Nostocales (Aphanizomenon gracile and Dolichospermum planctonicum) was supported by the entrance of water from a canal (due to supply of water containing NH4+-N). After water discharge, the replacement of Nostocales by the toxigenic Planktothrix agardhii was associated with low light conditions and a supply of phosphates from the bottom sediments. In Lake Mytycze, microalgae (Chlorococcales) were predominant throughout the study period. The rapid growth of toxigenic cyanobacteria (A. gracile, Planktolyngbya limnetica and Microcystis spp.) occurred only at extremely low water levels. In Lake Tomaszne, the lake with periodic water level regulation, the high cyanobacteria/cyanotoxin risk and decline of its ecological status were more conspicuous than in Lake Mytycze, the lake with natural water level changes.

Gary			Factors influencing spatial distribution and growth of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding biotic and abiotic factors that influence spatial distribution patterns, condition factor, and growth of lotic fish species within river impoundments is essential for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. This study aimed to compare relative abundance, condition factor, and growth rate of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) among eight sections of a 41 km long impoundment of the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Relative abundance of juvenile lake sturgeon, as measured by catch per unit effort (CPUE), was 3-6 times greater in the two farthest upstream sections when compared with the five farthest downstream sections. Growth in length was slowest for individuals captured in the two farthest upstream sections, moderate in the third section, and highest in the fourth section, with individuals from the fourth section attaining lengths approximately double those from the two farthest upstream sections by age 6. Condition factor varied among sections of the impoundment in a pattern similar to that observed for growth. Given similarities in many environmental factors such as water temperature and water chemistry among sections of this study area, our results provide important insight into how abiotic and biotic factors, combined with behavioural characteristics of this species, may influence distribution patterns and growth of juvenile lake sturgeon within river impoundments.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	2015	93	11					823	831		10.1139/cjz-2015-0058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-0058													WOS:000364531700002

Variation of limnological parameters in a tropical lake used for tilapia cage farming	AQUACULTURE REPORTS												The aim of this study was to assess the effects of tilapia cage culture on the water quality and sediment of Palminhas Lake during both the dry and rainy seasons. Eight sites within the lake (four in fish farms and four in areas without fish farms) and one site on an affluent stream were sampled monthly from February 2011 to January 2012. Dissolved oxygen and pH were significantly lower at fish farm sites than at locations without farms, while chlorophyll a was higher at fish farm sites. Moreover, large seasonal variations were observed, which were not related to the fish farms. The Secchi disc depth and ammonia nitrogen level were significantly higher during the dry season, but temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a were significantly higher during the rainy season. The affluent stream contributed substantially to lake eutrophication. Palminhas Lake is mesotrophic and has exhibited a progressive worsening in water quality over the past 20 years. These changes were not caused by fish farming alone but probably by other anthropic activities in the areas surrounding the lake. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Beitel, SC; Doering, JA; Patterson, SE; Hecker, M				Beitel, Shawn C.; Doering, Jon A.; Patterson, Sarah E.; Hecker, Markus			Assessment of the sensitivity of three North American fish species to disruptors of steroidogenesis using in vitro tissue explants	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												There is concern regarding exposure of aquatic organisms to chemicals that interfere with the endocrine system. One critical mechanism of endocrine disruption is impairment of steroidogenesis that can lead to altered hormone levels, altered or delayed sexual development, and ultimately reproductive failure. With the current large gap in knowledge and a high degree of uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of fishes native to northern ecosystems to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), the aim of this study was to develop an in vitro gonadal explant assay enabling the assessment of EDCs on sex-steroid production in wild fish species native to North America. Northern pike (Esox lucius), walleye (Sander vitreus), and white sucker (Catostomus commeroni) were sampled from a reference location in Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, Canada, at spawn and multiple post-spawn time points. Gonads were excised and immediately exposed for 24 h to a model inducer (forskolin) or inhibitor (prochloraz) of steroidogenesis in L-15 supplemented media. Furthermore, seasonal profiles of plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and 17-beta estradiol (E2) concentrations were characterized. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to quantify hormone concentrations in plasma and media. The seasonal profile of plasma hormones was significantly correlated with basal in vitro hormone production. Gonad tissue exposed to forskolin showed a concentration-dependent increase in E2 and a general increase in 11-KT. Gonad tissue exposed to prochloraz resulted in a decrease of concentrations of 11-KT and E2. These results illustrated that gonadal tissue is undergoing steroidogenesis in an in vitro setting that is comparable to in vivo hormone profiles, and which is responsive to chemical exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. The seasonal time point during which gonad explants were excised and exposed had an impact on the potency and magnitude of responses, resulting in a seasonal effect on sensitivity. Male and female white sucker showed greatest sensitivity to forskolin, while male and female walleye showed greatest sensitivity to prochloraz. Also, gonad explants from these species were found to have greater sensitivity than responses previously reported for in vitro explants of other fish species such as the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and stable cell lines currently used as screening applications to detect chemicals that might disrupt the endocrine system. Therefore, current approaches that use stable cell lines or tissue explants from standardized small bodied laboratory species might not be protective of some wild fish species. Future research is required that investigates whether this in vitro gonadal explant assay is predictive of in vivo effects in wild species of fishes.

J	Yu, SP; Yang, JS; Liu, GM				Yu, Shipeng; Yang, Jingsong; Liu, Guangming			Impact assessment of Three Gorges Dam's impoundment on river dynamics in the north branch of Yangtze River estuary, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												As one of the world's largest hydropower projects, the Three Gorges Dam (TGD)'s 156-175 m height storing test in flood recession seasons during 2006-2011 has aroused international attention. The novel approaches of cross-wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were firstly introduced to reveal the significant coherence and time lag property in time-frequency space between river dynamics in hydrological stations along Yangtze River. Then, using the optimum lag time nodes, corresponding regression models between river dynamics in these stations were established and utilized to assess the river dynamics in stations downstream under the impact of TGD's impoundment. Results showed that the average decrease ratio of 24.3 % in the Three-Gorge reservoir outflow was caused in TGD's impounding periods during 2006-2011. The corresponding average decrease ratios of 25.1, 16.5 and 1.9 % in Yichang flow, Datong flow (with 6 days lag), and estuarine Santiao river stage (with 32 days lag), respectively, were caused by TGD's impoundment during 2006-2011. In addition, the impact weights of multiple driving factors on estuarine river dynamics were discussed, and the main factor of the combined impacts of estuarine tidal fluctuation and sea level change while the secondary factor of the upper stream inflow were demonstrated. A further suggestion about the optimization design of TGD's safety impounding scheme was proposed to prevent estuarine saline water intrusion by guaranteeing the average daily increase of Three Gorges reservoir water level lower than 1.11 m/day during TGD's impounding period.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2014	72	2					499	509		10.1007/s12665-013-2971-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2971-1													WOS:000338324700017

Carbon sources of benthic fauna in temperate lakes across multiple trophic states	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Previous studies have shown that microbially produced methane can be a dominant carbon source of lacustrine sedimentary macrofauna in eutrophic lakes, most likely through grazing on methane-oxidizing bacteria. Here we investigate the contributions of different carbon sources to macrofaunal biomass across five lakes in central Switzerland that range from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic. Macrofaunal communities change with trophic state, with chironomid larvae dominating oligotrophic and tubificid oligochaetes dominating eutrophic lake sediments. The C-13-isotopic data suggest that the average contribution of methane-derived carbon to the biomass of both macrofaunal groups is similar but consistently remains minor, ranging from only similar to 1% in the oligotrophic lake to at most 12% in the eutrophic lakes. The remaining biomass can be explained by the assimilation of detritus-derived organic carbon. Low abundances of methane-cycling microorganisms in macrofaunal specimens, burrows, and surrounding sediment based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences and copy numbers of genes involved in anaerobic and aerobic methane cycling (mcrA, pmoA) support the interpretation of isotopic data. Notably, 16S rRNA gene sequences of macrofauna, including macrofaunal guts, are highly divergent from those in tubes or sediments. Many macrofaunal specimens are dominated by a single 16S rRNA phylotype of Fusobacteria, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, or epsilon-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, or Parcubacteria. This raises the question of whether dominant lake macrofauna live in so far uncharacterized relationships with detrital organic-matter-degrading bacterial endosymbionts.

Spawning migrations of the endemic Labeobarbus (Cyprinidae, Teleostei) species of Lake Tana, Ethiopia: status and threats	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The reproductive biology of the only known intact species flock of large cyprinids, the 16 Labeobarbus species of Lake Tana (Ethiopia), has been extensively studied for the past two decades. Seven species of Labeobarbus are known to migrate >50 km upstream into tributary rivers for spawning during the rainy season (July to October), whereas eight other species are absent from these rivers and probably developed a new strategy of lacustrine spawning (macro-spatial segregation). One species (L. intermedius) probably spawns in the lake as well as in the rivers. Between the early 1990s and 2000s, the riverine spawners showed a decline of 75% in both biomass and number in both fishery independent surveys and in commercial catches. Reproductive migration makes fishes vulnerable to fisheries and other threats like habitat modifications. Lacustrine spawners are probably more resilient as they are not known to form spawning aggregations that can easily be exploited by fishermen. In addition, upstream rivers and catchments around Lake Tana are highly degraded by erosion and recently subjected to intensive habitat modification for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. This article reviews results of field studies on the Labeobarbus spawning migration from Lake Tana to spawning rivers, giving emphasis on segregation and homing. It also summarizes existing and emerging threats which form potential causes for the decline of the migratory Labeobarbus species. Knowledge gaps on the reproductive biology are identified for further investigation.

In addition the denitrification rate and potential were measured, using the isotope-pairing technique concomitantly with the resuspension experiments. Resuspension increased the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) relatively more than the concentration of total nitrogen (TN), thus decreasing the TN to TP ratio, regardless of the phase of the growing season. Resuspension also had various effects on the dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. The denitrification rate was highest in May, when the supply of nitrate was high. In August, when the denitrification potential peaked due to high temperature, the low availability of nitrate limited nitrogen removal. However, sedimentary denitrification during the open-water season was so intense that it also lowered the N:P ratio in the water directly and not only by lowering the ratio in the sediment prone to resuspension.					; Hietanen, Susanna/F-7862-2011	Hietanen, Susanna/0000-0002-1572-8294; Niemisto, Juha/0000-0003-3516-5596; 													1863-9135					JUL	2012	180	3					193	205		10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0223													WOS:000306311000001

Recently, parasitic fungi, termed chytrids, have been found to play important roles in aquatic food webs. Yet, the diversity and community structure of planktonic fungi including chytrids are not well studied. In this study, we examined the temporal fluctuations of freshwater fungi, including chytrids, in Lake Inba by using molecular techniques of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE profiles, and associated sequence analysis, indicated that chytrids were present on all sampling dates from May to October (n = 12). In addition, analysis showed that a large proportion of the sequences belonged to chytrids of both parasitic and saprotrophic species. This finding was supported by microscopic observations using Calcofluor white to stain chytrids infecting various phytoplankton species. The percentages of infection by chytrids on two dominant diatom species, Aulacoseira granulata and Aulacoseira ambigua, showed a similar seasonal pattern in the DGGE band profiles. From the phylogenetic analysis and microscopic identification, the chytrids infecting the two diatoms are likely to be affiliated to Chytriomyces sp. and Zygorhizidium sp.. This is the first study to show that DGGE is a useful preliminary approach for examining the diversity of planktonic fungi including chytrids. Our results indicate both parasitic and saprotrophic chytrids are a significant component of freshwater fungi inhabiting the pelagic zone of Lake Inba, Japan. Further modification of DGGE, together with new molecular techniques and microscopic observation, would reveal the hidden diversity and ecological significance of planktonic fungi in aquatic ecosystems.					; Kagami, Maiko/L-4430-2018	Ishii, Nobuyoshi/0000-0002-3176-9918; Kagami, Maiko/0000-0003-3086-390X													0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2012	63	2					358	368		10.1007/s00248-011-9913-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9913-9								21805083					WOS:000300316500012

Geochemical, mineralogical and hydrological characterizations of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) in surface waters and sediments were performed in the Milluni Valley (main reservoir of water supply of La Paz, Bolivia, 4000 m a.s.l.), throughout different seasons during 2002 - 2004 to identify contamination sources and sinks, and contamination control parameters. PHE concentrations greatly exceeded the World Health Organization water guidelines for human consumption. The very acidic conditions, which resulted from the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mining waste, favoured the enrichment of dissolved PHEs (Cd > Zn >> As >> Cu similar to Ni > Pb > Sn) in surface waters downstream from the mine. Stream and Like sediments, mining waste and bedrock showed the highest PHE content in the mining area. With the exception of Fe, the PHEs were derived from specific minerals (Fe, pyrite; Zn, Cd, sphalerite, As, Fe, arsenopyrite, Cu, Fe, chalcopyrite, Pb, galena, Sn, cassiterite), but the mining was responsible for PHEs availability. Most of the PHEs were extremely mobile (As > Fe > Ph > Cd > Zn similar to Cu > Sn) in the mining wastes and the sediments downstream from the mine. pH and oxyhydroxides mainly explained the contrasted availability of Zn (mostly in labile fractions) and As (associated with Fe-oxyhydroxides). Unexpectedly, Pb, Zn, As, and Fe were significantly attenuated by organic matter in acidic lake sediments. Hydrological conditions highly influenced the behaviours of major elements and PHEs. During wet seasons, major elements were diluted by meteoric waters, whereas PHEs increased due to the dissolution of sulfides and unstable tertiary minerals that formed during dry seasons. This is particularly obvious at the beginning of the wet season and contributes to flushes of element transport downstream. The high altitude of the study area compensates for the tropical latitude, rendering the geochemical behaviour of contaminants similar to that of temperate and cold regions. These results might be representative of geochemical processes in ore deposits located in the high Andes plateau, and of their influence on PHE concentrations within the upper Amazon basin. Although mining activities in this region stopped 10 years ago, the impact of mining waste on water quality remains a serious environmental problem. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ran, J; Xiang, R; Li, J; Xiao, KY; Zheng, BH				Ran, Jiao; Xiang, Rong; Li, Jie; Xiao, Keyan; Zheng, Binghui			Spatiotemporal Variations in the Water Quality of Qionghai Lake, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, China	WATER												Although Qionghai Lake is one of the 11 large and medium-sized lakes (lake area > 25 km(2)) in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP), there has been little research on its water quality, especially over the long term. Herein, meteorological, hydrologic, trophic, and biochemical indices were investigated over the 2011-2020 period to explore the spatiotemporal variations in water quality in Qionghai Lake. The results showed that the CCME-WQI value for Qionghai Lake ranked between marginal and fair during 2011-2020, that the water quality of Qionghai Lake before 2017 was worse than after 2017, and that the water quality of the western part of Qionghai Lake was worse than that of the eastern part. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus were 0.39-0.51 and 0.019-0.027 mg/L during 2011-2020, respectively, and were the main pollution factors in Qionghai Lake. In addition, Qionghai Lake was at the mesotrophic level, but the chlorophyll and trophic state levels (TLI) increased year by year, and the levels in the western area were higher than in the eastern area. Increased anthropogenic activities (industrialization, urbanization, agricultural intensification, etc.) were the main reasons for the poor water quality of Qionghai Lake before 2017, while, after 2017, effective government environmental restoration and management measures improved the water quality. Moreover, the difference in land-use types within the watershed was the main reason for the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in Qionghai Lake. Potassium permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen content index (NH3-N) were not very high, but both showed seasonal variations. Water transparency (SD) in Qionghai Lake was reduced by sediment input and increased algal biomass, while dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased due to thermal stratification. This study is expected to provide a theoretical reference for understanding changes in the water quality and water environmental protection of Qionghai Lake and the YGP.					; XIANG, Rong/B-2589-2008	Zheng, Binghui/0000-0003-3169-1521; 														2073-4441				AUG	2022	14	15							2451	10.3390/w14152451	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14152451													WOS:000840166700001

Water quality of the volcanic crater lake, Lake Barombi Kotto, in Cameroon	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Cameroon is endowed with many freshwater lakes and rivers but, because of increasing anthropogenic activities, most of these water bodies are gradually being degraded. Lake Barombi Kotto is one of the volcanic crater lakes in Cameroon that serves as a prime source of drinking water for the Barombi Kotto community. The overall objective of the study was to determine the water quality of Lake Barombi Kotto making use of some physico-chemical parameters, Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI), Heavy Metal Pollution index (HPI) and some bacteriological parameters. Water samples were collected over two seasons across a longitudinal transect at two depths and subjected to physico-chemical, bacteriological, nutrient, Chlorophyllaand phytoplankton analyses using standard methods. Descriptions, Analyses of Variance, ordinations and correlations were used to analyse resulting data at alpha = 0.05. Lake Barombi Kotto had a TSI of 93.67 and 87.92 in the dry and rainy season, respectively, indicating it is eutrophic. Of the six heavy metals studied, only the concentration of Fe was above the WHO (2008) drinking water quality limits. The HPI of the lake was 4.17 and 6.19 for the dry and rainy seasons, respectively, well below the critical index limit of 100. This lake is contaminated with faecal coliforms and pathogenic bacteria, such asSalmonella. This study has not only set baseline conditions for additional monitoring, but has exposed key dynamics and significant socio-economic and public health risks to humans.

A mosaic community of macrophytes for the ecological remediation of eutrophic shallow lakes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The restoration of macrophytes in eutrophic shallow lakes has been the focus of active research in the past decade. The approach of building up a mosaic community of macrophytes (MCMs) to improve water quality and remediate the ecosystems of lakes is proposed in this paper. Several species of floating, floating-leaved, and submerged macrophytes were introduced in experimental enclosures in eutrophic shallow lakes. These macrophytes were intercropped in small patches and formed mosaic communities of spatial and temporal combinations (spatial and seasonal mosaic patterns) in the lakes. Macrophytes can improve water transparency quickly and the MCM system can stabilize this clear water state over a long time in turbid eutrophic shallow lakes. The constructed MCM created heterogeneous habitats that are favourable for different macrophytes and for the growth and succession of other organisms, as well as for removing water pollutants. When the eutrophic water flowed through the MCM system at a retention time of 7 days, the removal efficiency rates of the MCM system for algae biomass, NH4+-N, TN, TP and PO43--p were 58%, 66%, 60%, 72% and 80%, respectively.

In the present study, we have analysed the impact of future climate change on daily mean rainfall and heavy rainfall on seasonal and annual scales in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by using ten long-term runs of high-resolution regional climate models. We initially assessed the performance of each run and the multimodel ensemble mean in simulating the daily mean rainfall (PRE), the maximum one-day rainfall (Rx1day), the simple rainfall intensity index (SDII), the count of days when rainfall is greater than or equal to 20 mm (RR20mm), the total rainfall when the daily rainfall exceeds the 95th percentile of the wet-day rainfall (R95p) and the maximum number of consecutive days with more than or equal to 1 mm (CWD). Next, we examined the future changes of these indices, focusing on the multi-model ensemble mean and spread under the high emission scenario RCP8.5. The time frames considered are the mid and end of the twenty-first century (2035-2065 and 2070-2100, respectively). The results indicate that the performance of REMO2015-MPI-ESM was close to the multi-model ensemble mean in representing the mean rainfall and most heavy rainfall indices, while CanRCM4CamESM2 was identified as the worst performing model. The key finding of this study is that the multi-model ensemble mean project no significant change regarding the daily mean rainfall throughout the year and across all seasons by the middle of the 21st century, except of the western region of the country where a decrease is projected. Simultaneously, Rx1day, SDII, RR20mm, and R95p are projected to decrease almost everywhere during all seasons. Moreover, a consistent decrease in the number of wet days is projected. Focusing on the end of the century, the multi-model ensemble mean project an overall decrease in daily mean rainfall, especially in the western region of the DRC, with a more pronounced effect during MAM. The increase in Rx1day, SDII, RR20mm, and R95p, along with a decrease in CWD, is amplified in this period. These findings are useful for predicting the potential threats of precipitation-related diseases and natural hazards, as well as for designing climate-resilient infrastructure and socioeconomic activities in the DRC.					; Abel, Daniel/AHH-9264-2022; Tshimanga, Raphael/GRR-7322-2022; Ziegler, Katrin/KSM-5873-2024; Knight, Jasper/F-2288-2010	Pollinger, Felix/0000-0002-9519-2433; Rai, Praveen/0000-0001-8348-1150; Bangelesa, Freddy/0000-0001-6843-7776; Knight, Jasper/0000-0003-2035-9056; Abel, Daniel/0000-0001-9663-3248; 													2212-0947					DEC	2023	42								100620	10.1016/j.wace.2023.100620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2023.100620		OCT 2023											WOS:001101599800001

For this purpose, environmental parameters and diatom assemblages as biological quality components were investigated to determine the ecological status of eight creeks with monthly intervals between March 2015 and February 2016. A total of 132 diatom taxa were identified in eight creeks of the Lake Sapanca basin during the studied period. 19 taxa increased their relative abundance higher than 30% in at least one sample and showed a different seasonal pattern. Environmental parameters [nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus (TP), specific conductance, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen] were effective on the distribution of diatom assemblages. The ecological status of the creeks was characterized by using four different diatom indices (TIT, EPI-D, IPS, and TDI), however, only Trophic Index Turkey (TIT) represented significant positive correlations with log (TP) gradient. Both environmental parameters, the relative abundance of indicator species, and TIT index results stated that 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 8th stations had moderate, while 4th and 6th stations had good water quality. The good correlation of TIT index with log (TP), and its compatibility with the presence of indicator species at different stations indicates that this index could be used in the Lake Sapanca basin, and Sakarya basin where the lake basin is located. It is important to determine the water quality of the creeks in the Lake Sapanca basin since it is used for drinking water supply. For this purpose, environmental parameters and diatom assemblages as biological quality components were investigated to determine the ecological status of eight creeks with monthly intervals between March 2015 and February 2016. During the studied period, 19 taxa increased their relative abundance higher than 30% in at least one sample and showed a different seasonal pattern. Main nutrients [(nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate, total phosphorus (TP)] and some other parameters (specific conductance, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen) had strong impacts on the distribution of diatom assemblages. The ecological status of the creeks was characterized by using four different diatom indices, however, only Trophic Index Turkey (TIT) represented significant positive correlations with log (TP) gradient and separated the creeks as good and moderate ecological status. According to TIT, the 4th and 6th stations had a good ecological condition and were characterized by pollution-sensitive species such as Cymbella affinis, Reimeria sinuata, and Nitzschia dissipata. On the other hand, TIT resulted in the other stations having moderate ecological conditions, which had high nutrient levels and EC. Moreover, the occurrence of pollution-tolerant taxa such as Gomphonema angustatum, Ulnaria ulna, and Achnanthidium affine endorsed the moderate ecological conditions in these creeks. Based on the results, the TIT as a biological metric could be a useful tool for the assessment of running waters in the Sakarya river basin.

They are frequently considered vulnerable habitats. In the last decades, the reduction of rainfall in many areas, coupled with fertilizer overuse, is transforming wetlands, especially in climates with a pronounced dry season. We studied a seasonally flooded saline wetland, and focused on the changes in the microbial communities. Methods High-throughput sequencing was used to explore the diversity and structure of the prokaryotic communities present in the surface sediments. A water and soil salinity gradient along different lagoons in the wetland complex was observed. Results Salinity affected both microbial richness and composition. The highest microbial richness was observed in lagoons with lower salinity. Statistical analysis suggests that the differences in community composition were associated with differences in salinity level, although an anthropic disturbance (increasing levels of soil organic matter, SOM) that was present predominantly in one lagoon also had a noticeable effect. Sorting of samples using beta diversity distances revealed that differences among communities were due to the distinct habitats, that is, a lagoon's salinity and SOM, not water level cycles. Differences between flooded and dry-out seasons were also explored and the linear model showed that only a small number of OTUs (2.5%) had statistical differences between seasons. Conclusion Our findings will help in understanding the effects that both salinity and drying-out periods, which are increasing problems worldwide, may have on microbial communities and their resistance to seasonal fluctuations in water levels.

Yellow perch were used in the study for their socioeconomic and ecological importance within the Great Lakes basin, and the use of zebrafish allowed for a detailed analysis of the molecular effects of MeHg following a whole life-cycle exposure. Chronic whole life dietary exposure of F-1 zebrafish to MeHg mimics realistic wildlife exposure scenarios, and the twenty-week adult yellow perch exposure (where whole life-cycle exposures are difficult) captures early seasonal ovarian development. For both species, target dietary accumulation values were achieved prior to analyses. In zebrafish, several genes involved in reproductive processes were shown to be dysregulated by RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), but no significant phenotypic changes were observed regarding ovarian staging, fecundity, or embryo mortality. Yellow perch were exposed to dietary MeHg for 12, 16, or 20 weeks. In this species, a set of eight genes were assessed by QPCR in the pituitary, liver, and ovary, and no exposure-related changes were observed. The lack of genomic resources in yellow perch hinders the characterization of subtle molecular impacts. The ovarian somatic index, circulating estradiol and testosterone, and ovarian staging were not significantly altered by MeHg exposure in yellow perch. These results suggest that environmentally relevant MeHg exposures do not drastically reduce the reproductively important endpoints in these fish, but to capture realistic exposure scenarios, whole life-cycle yellow perch exposures are needed.

Effect of physico-chemical regimes and tropical cyclones on seasonal distribution of chlorophyll-a in the Chilika Lagoon, east coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A comprehensive analysis on spatiotemporal variation in physico-chemical variables and their control on chlorophyll-a during 2013-14 was carried out in the Chilika Lagoon. Spatiotemporal variation in physico-chemical regimes significantly controlled the phytoplankton biomass of the lagoon. Further, precipitation-induced river/terrestrial freshwater influx and marine influence controlled the physico-chemical regimes of the Chilika Lagoon, such as nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO43- and Si(OH)(4)), temperature, salinity, total suspended matter and dissolved oxygen. This study revealed significant effects of tropical cyclones Phailin (2013) and Hudhud (2014) on physico-chemical regimes and in turn the phytoplankton biomass of the lagoon. Although both cyclones Phailin (2013) and Hudhud (2014) were intense, Phailin (2013) had a greater impact on the Chilika Lagoon due to the proximity of its landfall. Heavy precipitation caused an influx of nutrient-rich freshwater, both during each cyclone's passage, through rainfall, and after, through increased river flow and terrestrial run-off. The increase in nutrients, carried by the run-off, promoted phytoplankton growth, albeit in lag phase. In general, phytoplankton growth was controlled by nitrogenous nutrients. However, the addition of SiO4 through terrigenous run-off fuelled preferential growth of diatoms. The salinity pattern (which can be considered a proxy for fresh and marine water influx) indicated injection of freshwater nutrients into the northern, southern and central sectors of the lagoon through riverine/terrestrial freshwater run-off; marine influx was restricted to the mouth of the lagoon. Present and past magnitudes of salinity and chlorophyll-a were also compared to better understand the pattern of variability. A significant change in salinity pattern was noticed after the opening of an artificial inlet, because of the resulting higher influx of marine water. The overall phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll-a concentration as a proxy) remained consistent in the lagoon pre- and post-restoration. Due to the wide range of salinity and temperature tolerance, diatoms remained dominant in both pre- and post-restoration periods, but the overall phytoplankton diversity increased after the artificial inlet was dredged.

Aluminium sulphate was used as the reference coagulant. The raw water used was collected from the River Oulujoki. The fractional composition of the water and the seasonal variation of the composition was also studied. For comparison, lake water from one source was also used. The NOM was fractionated into hydrophobic, transphilic and hydrophilic fractions. Aluminium formate was found to be able to remove the hydrophobic fraction the most readily. The removal of the transphilic and hydrophilic fraction was found to be less effective and also more sensitive to the coagulation pH than the hydrophobic fraction with both of the tested coagulants. Similar results were observed with aluminium sulphate. Aluminium formate was thus found to be a potential alternative in the removal of NOM to traditional aluminium coagulants, which can be harmful to process equipment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Groundwater is an essential source for drinking-water supply, as well as for agriculture and groundwater-related ecosystems. Thus, assessment of groundwater recharge is very important although also difficult because of the strong effects of evaporation and transpiration, as well as the limited available data.A simple, generalized approach, which requires only limited field data, freely available remote sensing data, and well-established concepts and models, is tested for assessing groundwater recharge in the southern part of the basin. This work uses the FAO dual- K c concept to estimate E and T coefficients at six locations that differ in soil texture, climate, and vegetation conditions. Measured values of soil water content and chloride concentrations along vertical soil profiles together with different scenarios for E and T partitioning and a Bayesian calibration approach are used to numerically simulate water flow and chloride transport using Hydrus-1D. Average groundwater recharge rates and the associated model uncertainty at the six locations are assessed for the 2003-2016 time period.Annual groundwater recharge varies between 6 and 93 mm and depends strongly on soil texture and related water retention and on vegetation. Interannual variability of groundwater recharge is generally greater than the uncertainty of the simulated groundwater recharge.

One-time extensive sampling was carried out during the post-rainy season (November-December) of 2016. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a Surber sampler and a D-frame net at twenty sites. Based on the measured physico-chemical variables, sampling sites were clustered into references (n = 8) and test sites (n = 4). Approximately thirty potential candidate metrics were tested, and five metrics were selected as core metrics: number of Ephemeroptera Plecoptera Trichoptera taxa, percentage of Ephemeroptera individuals, percentage of EPT individuals, percentage that were shredders, and the percentage that were filter-feeders. These metrics were scored on a continuous scale from 0 to 10. To develop Lake Tana subbasin multimetric index (LTSBMI), scores were added and scaled to produce a score from 0 to 100. The final index was divided into five water quality classes: 'very good', 'good', 'fair', 'poor' and 'very poor'. The LTSBMI was effective in discriminating sites with different levels of impacts, but should be checked to other localities. The current LTSBMI could be used for ecosystem health assessment and monitoring in different Aftropical river systems with similar agroecology.

However, most of the existing knowledge about catchment-scale metal partitioning in river systems is based on a limited number of observation points, which is not sufficient to characterize the complexity of large river systems. Here we present an extensive field-based dataset, composed of multi-year data from over 100 monitoring locations distributed over the large, transboundary Selenga River basin (of Russia and Mongolia), sampled during different hydrological seasons. The aim is to investigate on the basin scale, the influence of different hydroclimatic conditions on metal partitioning and transport. Our results showed that the investigated metals exhibited a wide range of different behaviors. Some metals were mostly found in the dissolved form (84-96% of Mo, U, B, and Sb on an average), whereas many others predominantly existed in suspension (66-87% of Al, Fe, Mn, Pb, Co, and Bi). Nevertheless, our results also showed a consistently increasing share of metals in dissolved form as the metals were transported to the downstream parts of the basin, closer to the Lake Baikal. Under high discharge conditions (including floods), metal transport by suspended particulate matter was significantly greater (about 2-6 times). However, since high and low water conditions could prevail simultaneously at a given point of time within the large river basin, e.g., as a result of on-going flood propagation, snap-shot observations of metal partitioning demonstrated contrasting patterns with domination of both particulate and dissolved phases in different parts of the basin. Such heterogeneity of metal partitioning is likely to be found in many large river systems. These results point out the importance of looking into different hydroclimatic conditions across space and time, both for management purposes and contaminant modeling efforts at the basin scale.

J	Wang, Y; Zhang, S; Chang, X				Wang, Yang; Zhang, Shuai; Chang, Xueer			Evapotranspiration Estimation Based on Remote Sensing and the SEBAL Model in the Bosten Lake Basin of China	SUSTAINABILITY												Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of both water balance and energy balance. Accordingly, the estimation of ET plays a key role in research related to regional water resources and energy balance. Using the largest inland freshwater lake in China-Bosten Lake Basin-as a target area, this study employs the SEBAL model combined with actual surface ET from the 2013 MODIS ET data to estimate ET in the Bosten Lake Basin from a time and space perspective. The findings include the following: (1) Evapotranspiration in the Bosten Lake Basin shows a unimodal distribution in terms of time distribution, with the highest ET occurring in July and August. In terms of spatial distribution, the overall trend is more apparent in the northwest portion of the basin than the southeast portion, as there are more mountains in the northwest as well as fewer desert areas. (2) Grassland and unused land were the main types of land cover, and ET exhibited a clear relationship to vegetation coverage and water supply. The distribution of land use types from northwest to southeast ET show a significant downward trend. (3) During the growing season, the average daily ET level of land use/cover type was the greatest over water bodies (5.61 mm/d), followed by grassland (4.6 mm/d) and snow/ice (4.29 mm/d), with unused land giving the smallest amounts of ET.																				2071-1050				SEP	2020	12	18							7293	10.3390/su12187293	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12187293													WOS:000584255200001

Poplar plantations resulted in a higher species number and Shannon's diversity. Species compositions were different between areas with poplar and reed populations: a lower ratio of hygrophytes but a higher ratio of mesophytes, and a higher ratio of heliophytes but a lower ratio of neutrophilous or shade plants in poplar areas compared to reed areas. Poplar plantations supported a higher ratio of ligneous plants in the entire Dongting Lake area, but there was no difference in the monitored plots. Unlike reedy areas, poplar plantations had higher light availability but lower soil water content during the growing seasons. These data suggest that young poplar plantations generally increased species richness and plant diversity, but significantly changed species composition due to the reduced soil water and increased light availability.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	, Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X; Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; 													2045-2322					SEP 11	2014	4								6339	10.1038/srep06339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06339								25208975					WOS:000341935000001

Remote sensing is a tool useful for understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of drained basins. In this study, we tested the application of high-resolution X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the German TerraSAR-X satellite from the 2009 growing season (July-September) for characterizing drained thermokarst lake basins of various age in the ice-rich permafrost region of the northern Seward Peninsula, Alaska. To enhance interpretation of patterns identified in X-band SAR for these basins, we also analyzed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image acquired on July 2009 and compared both X-band SAR and NDVI data with observations of basin age. We found significant logarithmic relationships between (a) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, (b) Landat-5 TM NDVI and basin age from 0 to 10,000 years, and (c) TerraSAR-X backscatter and basin age from 50 to 10,000 years. NDVI was a better indicator of basin age over a period of 0-10,000 years. However, TerraSAR-X data performed much better for discriminating radiocarbon-dated basins (50-10,000 years old). No clear relationships were found for either backscatter or NDVI and basin age from 0 to 50 years. We attribute the decreasing trend of backscatter and NDVI with increasing basin age to post-drainage changes in the basin surface. Such changes include succession in vegetation, soils, hydrology, and renewed permafrost aggradation, ground ice accumulation and localized frost heave. Results of this study show the potential application of X-band SAR data in combination with NDVI data to map long-term succession dynamics of drained thermokarst lake basins.

A New Zealand freshwater diatom transfer function was applied to infer past pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved reactive phosphorus and chlorophyll a. A precise, mixed-effect regression model of age versus depth was constructed from 11 tephra and 13 radiocarbon dates, with a basal age of 48.2 cal kyr BP. Diatom-inferred changes in paleolimnology and climate corroborate earlier inferences from geochemical analyses (Stephens et al. 2012), with respect to the timing of marked climate changes in the Last Glacial Coldest Phase (LGCP; 28.8-18.0 cal kyr BP), the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT; 18.0 to ca. 12-10 cal kyr BP) and the Holocene, the onset of which is difficult to discern from LGIT amelioration, but which includes an early climatic optimum (10.2-8.0 cal kyr BP). The LGCP is readily defined by a reduction in lake level and effective precipitation, whereas the LGIT represents a period of rising lake level, with greater biomass during the Holocene. There was limited change in diatom assemblage structure, influx or inferred water quality during a Late Glacial Reversal (LGR; 14.5-13.8 cal kyr BP), associated with heightened erosional influx. In contrast, an LGIT peak in paleoproductivity is recorded by increased diatom influx from 13.8 to 12.8 cal kyr BP. Changes in sediment influx and biomass record complex millennial-scale events attuned to the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14.5-12.8 cal kyr BP). Additional millennial-scale environmental change is apparent in the Holocene, with marked changes in lake circulation beginning at 7.6 cal kyr BP, including the onset of seasonal thermal stratification and rapid species turnover at 5.7 cal kyr BP. The most rapid diatom community turnover accompanied widely varying nutrient availability and greater seasonality during the last 3.3 cal kyr. Rising seasonality appears to have been linked to strengthened Southern Westerlies at their northern margins during the middle and late Holocene.					; Augustinus, Paul/B-5125-2011; Shane, Phil/HKV-7633-2023; Reid, Michael/E-9098-2012	Cochran, Ursula/0000-0001-8002-4958; Shane, Philip/0000-0002-7824-1184; Reid, Michael/0000-0002-3948-9347; Stephens, Thomas/0000-0002-0003-9269; Augustinus, Paul/0000-0002-1391-2151; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2012	48	4					801	817		10.1007/s10933-012-9645-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9645-y													WOS:000311395000009

Diverted Mississippi River sediment as a potential phosphorus source affecting coastal Louisiana water quality	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Mississippi River water and associated sediment are seasonally diverted into Louisiana coastal basins to restore historic hydrologic and salinity regimes and to slow or reverse the widespread wetland loss. More river diversions are planned; however, very little research has been conducted on the potential source of phosphorous (P) of these sediments transported by the Mississippi River into the coastal areas through these diversions. In addition, the sediments have the potential to undergo changes in redox status when these significant flooding events occur. Therefore, we examined the effect of sediment redox condition on P release from newly deposited Mississippi River sediment. Sediment was collected from Big Mar Lake, the receiving water body of the Caernarvon diversion structure, through which river water is diverted into the Breton sound estuary. Sediment suspensions were incubated in the laboratory under reducing conditions, and the relation of redox conditions to P release was determined. Soluble reactive P (SRP), dissolved organic P (DOP), Fe, and Mn concentrations increased with decreasing sediment redox potential. The SRP and DOP concentrations increased 32- and 8-fold during 20 days of anaerobic conditions. The increase in SRP and DOP availability was significantly correlated to an increase in ferrous iron with no significant relationship with Al, Ca, or Mg. While the vast majority of studies on nutrients associated with the Mississippi River diversions have focused on excess inorganic nitrogen forms (primarily NO3) in the river water, this study is one of the first to demonstrate that upon reduction associated with prolonged flooding, the diverted Mississippi River suspended sediment can be a significant source of available P to the coastal basin.					; DeLaune, R.D./A-2058-2012; White, John/A-7940-2008; White, John R./A-7940-2008	Zhang, Wen/0000-0002-8656-1727; White, John R./0000-0002-9967-013X													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2012	27	4					575	586		10.1080/02705060.2012.687698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2012.687698													WOS:000311786000010

Screening Drought-Tolerant Native Plants for Attractiveness to Arthropod Natural Enemies in the US Great Lakes Region	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Arthropods provide a variety of critical ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes; however, agricultural intensification can reduce insect abundance and diversity. Designing and managing habitats to enhance beneficial insects requires the identification of effective insectary plants that attract natural enemies and provide floral resources. We tested the attractiveness of 54 plant species with tolerance to dry soils, contrasting perennial forbs and shrubs native to the Great Lakes region to selected non-native species in three common garden experiments in Michigan during 2015-2016. Overall, we found 32 species that attracted significantly more natural enemies than associated controls. Among these, Achillea millefolium and Solidago juncea were consistently among the most attractive plants at all three sites, followed by Solidago speciosa, Coreopsis tripteris, Solidago nemoralis, Pycnanthemum pilosum, and Symphyotrichum oolantangiense. Species which attracted significantly more natural enemies at two sites included: Asclepias syriaca, Asclepias tuberosa, Monarda fistulosa, Oligoneuron rigidum, Pycnanthemum virginianum, Dasiphora fruticosa, Ratibida pinnata, Asclepias verticillata, Monarda punctata, Echinacea purpurea, Helianthus occidentalis, Silphium integrifolium, Silphium terebinthinaceum, Helianthus strumosus, and Symphyotrichum sericeum. Two non-native species, Lotus corniculatus, and Centaurea stoebe, were also attractive at multiple sites but less so than co-blooming native species. Parasitic Hymenoptera were the most abundant natural enemies, followed by predatory Coleoptera and Hemiptera, while Hemiptera (Aphidae, Miridae, and Tingidae) were the most abundant herbivores. Collectively, these plant species can provide floral resources over the entire growing season and should be considered as potential insectary plants in future habitat management efforts.

Based on the measured data and the proposed calculation method, we analyzed the adjustment mechanisms of the seasonal water level in the whole Yangtze River. The results were as follows. During the dry season, the rising precipitation and dam operation both increased the water level in the upper reaches and in the reaches from the Jianli to Datong stations during 1981-2014. Moreover, dam operations were the dominant factor (except at Datong station). In the reaches from the Yichang to Shashi stations, dam operations are the reason for the reduction of the measured water level in the dry season, while the rising precipitation had an opposite influence. During the flood season, dam operations helped to reduce the water level from the upper reaches to the estuary during 1981-2014, while climate variation stresses adversely affected the entire river basin. In the reaches between the Luoshan and Jianli stations, climate variation is the dominant factor for the increased water level during the flood season, while dam operation is the reason for the reduced water level at the other six hydrological stations.

J	Conway, D				Conway, Declan			Adapting climate research for development in Africa	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE												This paper reviews research on African climate from the major Sahel droughts in the early 1970s to current interest in improving the use of climate science within societal decision-making processes. During the last decade, and particularly since the mid-2000s, the development community has begun to engage seriously with the issue of climate change and its implications for the world's poor. This has led to a growing interaction with the climate research community. Recent climate literature is used to explore four research themes and identify knowledge gaps and areas with potential to adapt climate research for development needs. The first theme considers the development and use of seasonal forecasts and their portrayal by some as a relative success story, but with important skill limitations and need for much greater interaction with users. Forecast use is set within a wider context of generally low scientific understanding of the drivers of Africa's high climate variability and low research capacity. The second theme addresses the main influences on African climate variability and their response to climate change; high levels of uncertainty for future rainfall in some regions where remote influences are poorly resolved in global climate models. The third theme summarizes key elements of climate impacts research and shows a situation of rather ad hoc case studies and little engagement with decision-makers. Recent studies reveal an important move to couple more effectively impacts research with adaptation by focusing on the near future and drawing on current climate-society relationships. The fourth theme looks at the emerging evidence of anthropogenic climate change and secondary effects on African environments and, apart from widespread warming, shows an equivocal situation with evidence for anthropogenic ocean warming affecting regional rainfall. Detection is hampered by data availability and high levels of background variability. Finally, three emergent issues are discussed: (1) reflection on African climate research capacity and international collaboration suggests it is timely to review experiences from recent climate programs in Africa; (2) attempts to untangle climate signals from within complex livelihood systems face significant methodological challenges. These include the need to reconcile scientific observations and local perceptions and to clarify views that may over-simplify climate-society interactions, to avoid construction of a crisis narrative on Africa and climate change; (3) the challenge of linking climate science with decision-making to inform adaptation. Demand for information and confidence often exceeds what climate science can realistically achieve in many parts of Africa. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

How representative are subfossil assemblages of Chironomidae and common benthic invertebrates for the living fauna of Lake De Waay, the Netherlands?	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The distribution of benthic invertebrates and their subfossil remains was examined within the basin of De Waay, a dimictic, eutrophic lake in the Netherlands. We focused on Chironomidae, but also report the abundances of 11 invertebrate groups that potentially produce chitinous remains that are preserved in the fossil record, although their remains could only be identified at a coarser taxonomic resolution. Most living invertebrates sampled in different seasons were constrained to the littoral zone, with the exception of a few taxa (Ceratopogonidae, Chaoborus flavicans, and Chironomus) that are adapted to low oxygen conditions in the seasonally anoxic profundal zone. In contrast, assemblages of invertebrate remains in lake surface sediments were similar in the entire lake basin, suggesting that considerable numbers of invertebrate remains are transported and redeposited off-shore in Lake De Waay, due to its steep bathymetry. These results indicate that a single sediment sample obtained from the centre of this lake contains subfossil invertebrate remains originating from the entire lake basin. In Lake De Waay, the majority of taxa found in the living assemblages were identified as remains in lake surface sediments, at least for the Chironomidae that could be identified at a similar taxonomic level in living and subfossil assemblages. Of the total 44 chironomid taxa found in Lake De Waay, 35 taxa occurred in the living assemblages and 34 taxa occurred in the subfossil assemblages. Thirty chironomid taxa occurred both as living and subfossil specimens, and on average these 30 taxa represent 94% of the specimens encountered in a sediment sample. Five rare chironomid taxa present as living larvae were not detected in the subfossil assemblages. Conversely, eight rare and four common chironomid taxa were found in subfossil remains, but not in living assemblages. Our results indicate that subfossil assemblages in surface sediment samples provide spatially integrated and representative samples of the living assemblage. However, a combined approach examining both the living benthic invertebrate fauna and invertebrate remains in lake surface sediments will potentially give a more complete and detailed overview of benthic invertebrates in a lake ecosystem than an approach based exclusively on one of these groups.

Biology and Management of the Carrot Weevil (Coleoptera: Curcuclionidae) in North America	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT												The carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis (LeConte) (Coleoptera: Curcuclionidae), is a devastating pest of high value Apiaceous crops like carrots (Daucus carota subsp. sativusHoffm.), parsley (Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) Fuss), and celery (Apium graveolens L.). Although native to North America, it is a serious pest across the Eastern United States and Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. Females deposit eggs in the petiole of cultivated hosts, and upon hatching, larvae tunnel down through the petiole and into plant roots causing wilting, yellowing, and plant death. Scouting procedures focus mainly on adult activity and require detection of small egg scars on the foliage and crown of the root, or reliance on traps that are only effective at the beginning of the season before the crop emerges. Several avenues of cultural, biological, and chemical control have been explored for this pest, but with limited success. Furthermore, investigation of these management strategies have primarily focused on carrot systems, neglecting other cultivated Apiaceae. Here we present a review of carrot weevil research and highlight key knowledge gaps in the carrot weevil system, which impede our understanding of this insect's biology and behavioral ecology. Future research addressing these key knowledge gaps will expand our understanding of this pest and contribute to the development and implementation of more effective management strategies.

J	Heredia, NA; Budy, P				Heredia, Nicholas A.; Budy, Phaedra			Trophic Ecology of Lahontan Cutthroat Trout: Historical Predator-Prey Interaction Supports Native Apex Predator in a Unique Desert Lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Pyramid Lake, Nevada, remains one of the last strongholds for lacustrine-strain Lahontan Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi (LCT) following historical declines throughout their native range. Historically the apex predator in this aquatic ecosystem, LCT in Pyramid Lake are now entirely dependent on hatchery programs and are potentially threatened by the introduction of a nonnative piscivore. The purpose of this study was to identify strong food web interactions and potential trophic limitations to the LCT population. Our specific objectives were to estimate seasonal foraging patterns, trophic position (TP), trophic niche space, diet composition, and seasonal depth distributions of LCT relative to prey fish. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for competition between LCT and nonnative, piscivorous Sacramento Perch Archoplites interruptus by examining diet overlap and trophic niche space. Our results indicate that LCT are apex predators, with TP (large [>400mm TL] LCT: TP [mean +/- 1.96<bold>SE</bold>]= 4.30 +/- 0.04) and diet composition indicating high rates of piscivory (average annual rate of piscivory=77.1% for large LCT) throughout the year. Small (200-400mm TL) LCT exhibited weak dietary overlap (Schoener's index=0.55) and large LCT exhibited strong overlap (Schoener's index=0.72) with Sacramento Perch. These trends were present despite seasonal changes in distribution and catch of Tui Chub Siphateles bicolor, the primary prey of LCT. Analysis of isotopic niche space also indicated strong overlap between the trophic niche of large LCT (89%) and that of Sacramento Perch; however, overall catch rates of Sacramento Perch were low. Despite the presence of a potential nonnative competitor, LCT demonstrate high rates of piscivory and are not negatively influenced by Sacramento Perch. Overall, these results demonstrate how trophic niche ecology can be used to evaluate key food web interactions in anthropogenically altered ecosystems.

Lake Kinneret (Israel): New insights into Holocene regional palaeoclimate variability based on high-resolution multi-proxy analysis	HOLOCENE												The southern Levant is a Mediterranean climate zone of complex variability in which uncertainty remains in regional palaeoclimate reconstruction. In spite of the proven value of diatoms in circum-Mediterranean palaeoenvironmental research, their potential remains largely unexplored in the southern Levant region. In this study, we generate a new, high-resolution multi-proxy record for the last ca. 9000 cal. yr BP, supported by diatom data and key biological, mineralogical and geochemical indicators preserved in a 17.8-m-long sediment sequence recovered from Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee), Israel. During the Holocene, well-correlated shifts in the diatom, minero-geochemical and palynological data indicate marked lake-level variation over time as well as changes in the trophic state of Lake Kinneret. Our results are particularly important in improving the reconstruction of Holocene lake-level variation, and thus past moisture availability. Diatom-inferred lake-level oscillations correlate well with the output from climatic models from the Levantine region and clarify previous uncertainty concerning regional variation in moisture availability. The Early Holocene (from ca. 9000 to 7400 cal. yr BP) was characterized by lake-level shifts due to fluctuating dry-wet climate conditions. During the mid-Holocene (from 7400 to 2200 cal. yr BP), a stable, deep lake-level phase persisted due to high humidity. The lake level of modern Lake Kinneret not only fluctuates seasonally with available moisture, but has also been influenced for ca. 2000 years by the impacts of water abstraction for human consumption and agriculture. Over the last 9000 cal. yr BP, the trophic state of Lake Kinneret has changed from an oligotrophic to a meso- to eutrophic environment, mainly triggered by increased human impact from around 2200 cal. yr BP onwards. The lake's ecosystem status was not strongly affected by the documented major changes in human occupation patterns during the mid-Holocene, when a relatively stable environment persisted.

Incidence of somatic and F plus coliphage in Great Lake Basin recreational waters	WATER RESEARCH												There is a growing interest for the use of coliphage as an alternative indicator to assess fecal pollution in recreational waters. Coliphage are a group of viruses that infect Escherichia coli and are considered as potential surrogates to infer the likely presence of enteric viral pathogens. We report the use of a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafiltration single agar layer method to enumerate F+ and somatic coliphage from surface waters collected from three Great Lake areas. At each location, three sites (two beaches; one river) were sampled five days a week over the 2015 beach season (n = 609 total samples). In addition, culturable E. coli and enterococci concentrations, as well as 16 water quality and recreational area parameters were assessed such as rainfall, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and ultra violet absorbance. Overall, somatic coliphage levels ranged from non-detectable to 4.39 log(10) plaque forming units per liter and were consistently higher compared to F+ (non-detectable to 3.15 log(10) PEON, regardless of sampling site. Coliphage concentrations weakly correlated with cultivated fecal indicator bacteria levels (E. coli and enterococci) at 75% of beach sites tested in study (r = 0.28 to 0.40). In addition, ultraviolet light absorption and water temperature were closely associated with coliphage concentrations, but not fecal indicator bacteria levels suggesting different persistence trends in Great Lake waters between indicator types (bacteria versus virus). Finally, implications for coliphage water quality management and future research directions are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research was conducted in the area of Lake Tornetrisk in northern Sweden where we utilized five proxy parameters to detect insect outbreak events over the 19th and 20th centuries. Digital change detection was applied on three pairs of multi-temporal NDVI images from Landsat TM/ETM+ to detect significant reductions in the photosynthetic activity of forested areas during disturbed growing seasons. An image segmentation gap-fill procedure was developed in order to compensate missing scan lines in Landsat ETM+ "SLC-off" images. To account for a potential dependence of local outbreak levels on elevation, a digital elevation model was included in the defoliation recognition process. The resulting damage distribution map allowed for the assessment of outbreak intensity and distribution at the stand level and was combined with tree-ring data and historical documents to produce a multi-evidence outbreak detection. Defoliation events in the tree-ring data were recognized as significant deviations from temperature related growth.

An appraisal of the Great Lakes advanced hydrologic prediction system	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Great Lakes water level forecasts are used to inform decisions ranging from personal choices of recreational activities to corporate evaluations of alternative cargo transport options. For effective decision-making it is important that these model-based forecasts include an accurate expression of the forecast uncertainty, as well as information regarding the model forecasting skill. We provide an assessment of water level forecasts from 1997 through 2009 that were made using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System (AHPS). A visual comparison between observed and forecast water levels suggests that AHPS generally captures seasonal and inter-annual patterns. A more quantitative assessment based on the percentage of observations within 90% prediction intervals, however, indicates that AHPS generally underestimates the observed variability of Great Lakes water levels. This assessment provides a benchmark for forecast performance against which alternative model structures (including future evolutions of AHPS) can be tested, and a basis to identify and prioritize the implementation of those alternatives. Including a calibrated model error term into the AHPS framework, to accommodate the underestimated variability, is a priority for short-term development and research, and represents one step toward more accurately quantifying forecast uncertainty. Our results also underscore the importance of storing historical forecasts and the data from which they were derived to serve as a basis for assessing model performance and prioritizing future model improvements.

Evaluation of the impact of aquatic-animal excretion on nutrient recycling and retention in stormwater treatment wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The relative contribution of aquatic animals to phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) cycles of water bodies can be substantial. Excretion rates can be affected by seasonal environmental conditions, physiology, and body size. Determining the importance of particular species or size classes to total fauna-driven internal recycling of nutrients requires measurements of seasonal mass-specific excretion rates (MSER). We used short-term incubation experiments to estimate the contribution of excretion and egestion by eight species of fish and one macroinvertebrate to water column P and N in Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) used to retain P from water flowing to the Everglades in Florida, U.S.A. To account for environmental conditions and fish physiology, excretion was estimated during day and night in the wet and dry seasons for nine of the most abundant fish and invertebrates found in the STAs. To yield measurable contributions of analytes in short-duration incubations, large-fish species were incubated individually, whereas small-fish species and invertebrates were incubated in single-species groups. For large-fish species, total excreted nutrients were positively correlated with the mass of individual fish, but MSER decreased with increased individual size. All four small species, three fish and invertebrate, excreted P and N at greater MSERs than all five large-fish species. Most MSERs were not correlated with incubated mass (stocked density) of small animals (80%), indicating that there were no density-dependent effects on excretion rates. Most species excreted more N and less P during the South Florida wet season (May to October) though this was not the case for one or more analytes for three of the large species. Most species excreted more during the day, except large herbivores that excreted more at night. Small species excreted higher proportions of particulate P and N, while the larger species had higher proportions of dissolved nutrients. Using measured MSERs and areal biomass estimates for the nine species, we estimated mass of P and N excreted annually. Based on known inflow P and N loads for four STAs, a preliminary and conservative estimate is that fish excretion can recycle between 50% to 92% of the annual total P entering the system and 15% to 29% of the annual total N entering the system. These preliminary results underestimate the actual amounts because they do not account for STA cells that were not sampled, nor known under-estimation of large-fish biomass, as well as other animal effects on nutrient cycles such as bioturbation. Though preliminary, our results suggest that altering aquatic animal abundance or species composition could improve the efficiency of STAs to remove and retain nutrients from inflowing waters.

The Kumgangsan Dam was constructed (in North Korea) in the Transboundary River (North Han river) that affects the water resources downstream (in South Korea) of the dam. The amount of water resource (e.g., streamflow, discharge) downstream of the Kumgangsan dam has decreased after the dam construction which might cause decreased hydroelectric power and water pollution in the downstream dams, especially during the dry season. Thus, this study analyzed the changes in the inflow into the Euiam Lake (North Han River) by the construction of the Kumgangsan Dam through hydrological modeling and examined the discharge of Chuncheon Dam (inflow into Euiam Lake) considering the flow control in the Kumgangsan Dam under the dry condition scenario. In addition, the changes of base flow during different seasons were analyzed because the majority of streamflow is contributed by the base flow during dry and drought seasons. As shown in the results, it was found that the discharge from the Kumgangsan Dam has a wide effect on the downstream dams located in South Korea. The inflow of downstream dams was significantly influenced by the discharge of the upstream dam, and the base flow was also affected by the decreased discharge of dams. Based on these findings, upstream dam managements should be carefully considered to maintain the water resource and aquatic ecosystem for the downstream dam watershed. Furthermore, the results of this study can be used as the preliminary information when discussing the problems of water allocation and flood prevention with North Korea.

These conditions have been suspected to favour emergence and spread of cholera epidemics. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to assess the influence of these conditions on outbreaks, reports of cholera cases were collected weekly from each health district of North Kivu (4,667,699 inhabitants) and South Kivu (4,670,121 inhabitants) from 2000 through 2007. A geographic information system was established, and in each health district, the relationships between environmental variables and the number of cholera cases were assessed using regression techniques and time series analysis. We further checked for a link between complex emergencies and cholera outbreaks. Finally, we analysed data collected during an epidemiological survey that was implemented in Goma after Nyiragongo eruption. A total of 73,605 cases and 1,612 deaths of cholera were reported. Time series decomposition showed a greater number of cases during the rainy season in South Kivu but not in North Kivu. Spatial distribution of cholera cases exhibited a higher number of cases in health districts bordering lakes (Odds Ratio 7.0, Confidence Interval range 3.8-12.9). Four epidemic reactivations were observed in the 12-week periods following war events, but simulations indicate that the number of reactivations was not larger than that expected during any random selection of period with no war. Nyiragongo volcanic eruption was followed by a marked decrease of cholera incidence. Conclusion/Significance: Our study points out the crucial role of some towns located in lakeside areas in the persistence of cholera in Kivu. Even if complex emergencies were not systematically followed by cholera epidemics, some of them enabled cholera spreading.					; Giraudoux, Patrick/B-9274-2011	piarroux, renaud/0000-0002-4151-4134; 													1935-2735					MAY	2009	3	5							e436	10.1371/journal.pntd.0000436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000436								19436726					WOS:000267268000010

River Mahanadi, India was selected as a model for the present study. Based on elevation from mean sea level, twelve sampling sites from Sambalpur to Naraj were grouped into three zones viz. upper zone (71 km), middle zone (142 km) and lower zone (103 km). Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI) revealed eutrophic state in middle and lower zone and with mesotrophic condition in the upper zone. Along the river stretch, a negative correlation was observed between Chl a concentration and flow velocity at all three zones during post monsoon (r = - 0.15) and monsoon (r = - 0.31). Seasonal study revealed higher Chl a concentration (16.16-283.85 mu g l(-1)) in post-monsoon with recorded mean flow velocity (0.28 +/- 0.19 ms(-1)) as compared to monsoon season with lower Chl a (18.68-232.24 mu g l(-1)) and mean flow velocity (0.54 +/- 0.21 ms(-1)). Among environmental variables, water temperature and pH showed a positive correlation with Chl a. Overall, the findings of this study illustrated the occurrence of higher phytoplankton biomass (quantified as Chl a) during post-monsoon season coincides with low water velocity. The dataset of this work can be implicated for the hydrological and the ecological framework of the tropical river Mahanadi in the Indian Territory.

A longer ice-free season with higher water temperatures may accelerate somatic growth in lake ectotherms, leading to widespread ecological implications. In fish, rising temperatures are expected to boost rates of food intake and conversion, and predictions based on empirical relationships between temperature and growth suggest a substantial increase in fish growth rates during the last decades. Fish abundance negatively affects growth by limiting food availability. This field study addresses the effects of climate warming on growth of a subarctic population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.) over nearly 40 years. Juvenile growth of 680 individuals of Arctic charr, was reconstructed by sclerochronological analysis using sagittal otoliths sampled annually from the early 1980s to 2016. Statistical modelling revealed a positive effect of water temperature, and a negative effect of abundance on somatic growth in juvenile individuals. Temperature dependence in growth was significant for average and fast-growing individuals across all investigated age classes. These findings suggest that, as temperatures rise, somatic growth of Arctic charr will increase in high latitude lakes. Climate warming will thus influence cold water fish life history and size-structured interactions, with important consequences for their populations and ecosystems.																			2045-2322					OCT 5	2023	13	1							16749	10.1038/s41598-023-43654-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43654-1								37798382					WOS:001085340000077
J	De Crop, W; Verschuren, D				De Crop, Wannes; Verschuren, Dirk			Mixing regimes in the equatorial crater lakes of western Uganda	LIMNOLOGICA												In order to understand the ecological functioning of lake ecosystems, little is more crucial than knowledge of their mixing regime. However in tropical regions, this information is scarce for all except the largest lakes, and often inferred from occasional observation of physical water-column properties. In this study, a total of 276 water-column profiles of temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen collected between 2000 and 2017 in 60 volcanic crater lakes in equatorial western Uganda are used to classify these lakes according to mixing regime. Most study lakes are small (on average 29 ha), but together they cover a spectacularly large gradient in maximum depth (Z(max)) between 1.4 m and >220 m, and consequently they display a wide range of mixing regimes. We identified four lakes as continuous warm polymictic, 12 as discontinuous warm polymictic, and 11 other lakes mix completely once or twice each year. We classify these 11 lakes as equatorial dimictic, because they experience deep mixing during both dry seasons separated by long periods of stable stratification, while the season of complete mixing may differ between years and among neighbouring lakes. The 33 remaining lakes do not usually mix completely and are thus meromictic. Relative depth (Z(r)) is the main factor controlling the mixing regime of these lakes. The presence of a shallow permanent chemocline reduces mixing depth, and the smallest meromictic lakes (< 3 ha) tend to occasionally mix deeper than predicted by Z(r). Based on these variables, predictions can be made about the mixing dynamics of Ugandan crater lakes not covered by our dataset. Previous suggestions that the mixing depth of tropical crater lakes is strongly influenced by the wind shelter provided by a high crater rim or by water-column transparency could not be confirmed.

J	Taye, MA				Taye, Mintesinot Azene			Agro-ecosystem sensitivity to climate change over the Ethiopian highlands in a watershed of Lake Tana sub-basin	HELIYON												The study analyzed the level of agro-ecosystem sensitivity to climate change among the agro-climatic zones (ACZs) that are situated in the highlands of Lake Tana sub-basin. The analyses considered the actual land capability class (LCC in % considering soil texture, slope and elevation zone), crop diversity (count), length of growing period (LGP, month), and inter-annual variability of climate (mean annual rainfall-MARF in mm, mean monthly minimum temperature-MMMinT in degrees C, and mean monthly maximum temperature-MMMaxT in degrees C). For comparison purpose, it was essential to index/standardize the values of specified indicators. The proportion of arable land varied from 13.30% (in the Sub-Alpine) to 93.00% (in the Moist-Cold). The value of coefficient of variation showed the presence of variations of 7.85-11.21 (%), 7.21-10.34 (%), 16.37-39.61 (%) for MARF (mm), MMMaxT (degrees C), and MMMinT (degrees C), respectively across the ACZs. The inter-annual variability of both onset and offset time of rainy season was found to be in the range of 0.3-1.25 months. The LGP (month) was in the range of 3.25-6.25 across the ACZs; whereas crop diversity (count) ranged from 2-7. The production of red onion (allium cepa), oat (Avena sativa), local wheat (Triticum), and pea (Pisum sativum) was abandoned in the Sub-Alpine; whereas the production of linseed (Linmu usitatisimum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and niger (Guizotia abyssinica) in the Moist-Cool. Yet, crops like maize and tef became the common crops in the Cold, possibly because of global warming. The indexed value of agro-ecosystem sensitivity to climate change ranged from 0.14-0.71. The level of agro-ecosystem sensitivity was higher towards the Sub-Alpine. The local development interventions to be made in the various ACZs need to be determined/prioritized considering the level of agro-ecosystem sensitivity.																				2405-8440				JUL	2021	7	7							e07454	10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07454		JUL 2021						34278034					WOS:000687263500010

Phytoplankton was sampled at 2 stations of the lake, paralleled with physical (water temperature, Secchi depth, pH, conductivity) and chemical (DO, chlorophyll-a, alkalinity, total hardness, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, NO2-N, NO3-N, NH3-N) analyses. The Q index was able to follow the main seasonal changes of the physical and chemical parameters and indicated a moderate ecological status for Lake Mogan. Phytoplankton biomass varied between 0.75 and 10.12 mg/L in the research period, and provided a similar ecological state by Q index, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, and Secchi depth. A total of 76 phytoplankton species were identified in the study period, belonging to 12 functional groups.

Analysis of mid-twentieth century rainfall trends and variability over southwestern Uganda	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												A methodology has been applied to investigate the spatial variability and trends existent in a mid-twentieth century climatic time series (for the period 1943-1977) recorded by 58 climatic stations in the Albert-Victoria water management area in Uganda. Data were subjected to quality checks before further processing. In the present work, temporal trends were analyzed using Mann-Kendall and linear regression methods. Heterogeneity of monthly rainfall was investigated using the precipitation concentration index (PCI). Results revealed that 53 % of stations have positive trends where 25 % are statistically significant and 45 % of stations have negative trends with 23 % being statistically significant. Very strong trends at 99 % significance level were revealed at 12 stations. Positive trends in January, February, and November at 40 stations were observed. The highest rainfall was recorded in April, while January, June, and July had the lowest rainfall. Spatial analysis results showed that stations close to Lake Victoria recorded high amounts of rainfall. Average annual coefficient of variability was 19 %, signifying low variability. Rainfall distribution is bimodal with maximums experienced in March-April-May and September-October-November seasons of the year. Analysis also revealed that PCI values showed a moderate to seasonal rainfall distribution. Spectral analysis of the time components reveals the existence of a major period around 3, 6, and 10 years. The 6- and 10-year period is a characteristic of September-October-November, March-April-May, and annual time series.

Fish colonization of artificial reefs in a large Neotropical reservoir: material type and successional changes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Artificial reefs have barely been used in Neotropical reservoirs (about five studies in three reservoirs), despite their potential as a fishery management tool to create new habitats and also to understand fish ecology. We experimentally assessed how reef material (ceramic, concrete, and PVC) and time modulated fish colonization of artificial reefs deployed in Itaipu Reservoir, a large reservoir of the mainstem Parana River, Brazil. Fish richness, abundance, and biomass were significantly greater in the reef treatments than at control sites. Among the experimental reefs, ceramic followed by the concrete treatments were the materials most effectively colonized, harboring the majority of the 13 fish species recorded. Although dependent on material type, many of the regularities of ecological successions were also observed in the artificial reefs, including decelerating increases in species richness, abundance, mean individual size, and species loss rates with time and decelerating decreases of species gain and turnover rates. Species composition also varied with material type and time, together with suites of life history traits: more equilibrium species (i.e., fishes of intermediate size that often exhibit parental care and produce fewer but larger offspring) of the Winemiller-Rose model of fish life histories prevailed in later successional stages. Overall, our study suggests that experimental reefs are a promising tool to understand ecological succession of fish assemblages, particularly in tropical ecosystems given their high species richness and low seasonality.

The effect of a dynamic background albedo scheme on Sahel/Sahara precipitation during the mid-Holocene	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We have implemented a new albedo scheme that takes the dynamic behaviour of the surface below the canopy into account, into the land-surface scheme of the MPI-ESM. The standard (static) scheme calculates the seasonal canopy albedo as a function of leaf area index, whereas the background albedo is a gridbox constant derived from satellite measurements. The new (dynamic) scheme additionally models the background albedo as a slowly changing function of organic matter in the ground and of litter and standing dead biomass covering the ground. We use the two schemes to investigate the interactions between vegetation, albedo and precipitation in the Sahel/Sahara for two time-slices: pre-industrial and mid-Holocene. The dynamic scheme represents the seasonal cycle of albedo and the correspondence between annual mean albedo and vegetation cover in a more consistent way than the static scheme. It thus gives a better estimate of albedo change between the two time periods. With the introduction of the dynamic scheme, precipitation is increased by 30mmyr(-1) for the pre-industrial simulation and by about 80mmyr(-1) for the mid-Holocene simulation. The present-day dry bias in the Sahel of standard ECHAM5 is thus reduced and the sensitivity of precipitation to mid-Holocene external forcing is increased by around one third. The locations of mid-Holocene lakes, as estimated from reconstructions, lie south of the modelled desert border in both mid-Holocene simulations. The magnitude of simulated rainfall in this area is too low to fully sustain lakes, however it is captured better with the dynamic scheme. The dynamic scheme leads to increased vegetation variability in the remaining desert region, indicating a higher frequency of green spells, thus reaching a better agreement with the vegetation distribution as derived from pollen records.

This study investigated the occurrence, spatiotemporal variation mechanisms, sources, and ecological risks of estrone (E1), 178-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and bisphenol-A (BPA) in the waters of the Zijiang River, a tributary of the middle Yangtze River. The results revealed elevated detection frequencies and estrogen concentrations in the dry season compared to the wet season, mainly due to the precipitation dilution effect. Total estrogen concentration ranged from 21.2 to 97.5 ng/L in the dry season, which was significantly correlated to spatial distributions of animal husbandry and population. Among the estrogens studied in the river, E2, BPA, and EE2 were predominant. The collective sources of E1, E2, E3, and EE2 were traced back to human and husbandry excrement, whereas BPA emitted from daily life products, contributing to 55.5% and 42.7% of the total estrogen concentration, respectively. Particularly, the average and median E1, E2, and EE2 concentrations in the river exceeded the environmental quality standards of the European Union. The total estrogenic activity dominated by EE2 exceeded the 1 ng E2/L threshold, with levels exceeding 10 ng E2/L during the dry season. The risk quotients exhibited a high ecological risk of E1 and EE2 to fish and a moderate to high ecological risk of E1 to crustaceans, EE2 to mollusks, and E2 to fish. Therefore, E1, E2, and EE2 pollution of the river may lead to both high estrogenic potency and moderate or high ecological risk; thus, they should be considered priority pollutants in the river. These results yield valuable insights into the spatiotemporal change mechanisms, sources, and ecological risks of estrogens in river water of low-urbanization and rural watersheds.

Impacts of dreissenid mussel growth and activity on phytoplankton and nutrients in Lake Erie's western basin	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												To examine the potential impact of invasive dreissenid mussels on in situ populations of phytoplankton and nutrients in western Lake Erie, we combined mussel population estimates from a 2018 survey, results from mussel excretion, grazing, and in situ growth experiments, along with nutrient measurements on collected lake water. We calculated the proportion of the water column filtered per day, based on both clearance rates from grazing experiments and mussel biomass. In most cases the water column was filtered less than once per day. Based on mussel densities from nearby survey sites, we found that mussels could be expected to clear less than 5% of phytoplankton from the water column each day. We combined measurements of nitrogen and phosphorus excretion by mussels with survey densities and found that concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus from excretion were much less than the ambient inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus measured throughout the season. Despite the modest potential impact that we measured, spatial variability in mussel density and temporal variability in nutrients and seston suggest that more substantial impact likely occurs in some conditions. Lastly, we used a mass balance approach to compare flows of nitrogen and phosphorus attributable to mussel assimilation, growth, and excretion. The proportion of assimilated nitrogen (0.01-0.21) and phosphorus (0.007-0.08) due to growth changed markedly throughout the season, but the excretion rate sometimes exceeded the apparent assimilation rate. These differences in growth:assimilation suggest changes in food quantity or quality, fluctuations in growth rates over time, or other physiological effects can lead to short-term imbalance in nutrient cycling by mussels, which could lead to locally important impacts on phytoplankton and algal blooms. Moreover, this work underscores the importance of mapping mussel densities at fine spatial scales and across interannual variation.					; Godwin, Casey/JVZ-2099-2024; Carter, Glenn/P-4744-2016; Carrick, Hunter/IUP-4379-2023	Glyshaw, Paul/0000-0003-1962-2021; Carter, Glenn/0000-0001-6630-7513; Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843; 													1463-4988	1539-4077				OCT-DEC	2023	26	4					87	99		10.14321/aehm.026.04.87	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.026.04.87													WOS:001252265200008

Consequences of Hatch Phenology on Stages of Fish Recruitment	PLOS ONE												Little is known about how hatch phenology (e.g., the start, peak, and duration of hatching) could influence subsequent recruitment of freshwater fishes into a population. We used two commonly sympatric fish species that exhibit different hatching phenologies to examine recruitment across multiple life stages. Nine yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) annual cohorts were sampled from 2004 through 2013 across larval, age-0, age-1, and age-2 life stages in a Nebraska (U.S.A.) Sandhill lake. Yellow perch hatched earlier in the season and displayed a more truncated hatch duration compared to bluegill. The timing of hatch influenced recruitment dynamics for both species but important hatching metrics were not similar between species across life stages. A longer hatch duration resulted in greater larval yellow perch abundance but greater age-1 bluegill abundance. In contrast, bluegill larval and age-0 abundances were greater during years when hatching duration was shorter and commenced earlier, whereas age-0 yellow perch abundance was greater when hatching occurred earlier. As a result of hatch phenology, yellow perch recruitment variability was minimized sooner (age-0 life stage) than bluegill (age-1 life stage). Collectively, hatch phenology influenced recruitment dynamics across multiple life stages but was unique for each species. Understanding the complexities of when progeny enter an environment and how this influences eventual recruitment into a population will be critical in the face of ongoing climate change.					; Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019	Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563; 													1932-6203					OCT 20	2016	11	10							e0164980	10.1371/journal.pone.0164980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164980								27764216					WOS:000386204500092

Recent water level declines in the Lake Michigan-Huron system	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Great Lakes water levels have fluctuated over thousands of years. High water levels were a problem in the 1980s, but a recent sudden drop in Lakes Michigan and Huron has caused particular concern, in part because lower water levels are consistent with many global climate change scenarios. We examined water level data (1860-2006) representing Lakes Michigan and Huron to evaluate changes in both long-term and seasonal patterns over time, and explore relationships with candidate predictor variables. Our tools for this analysis included both Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL), and dynamic linear models (DLM). In addition to the recent decline, STL results reveal a sustained decline around 1900, a long-term periodicity of similar to 30 years, and an unexpected correspondence with sunspot activity. DLM results indicate a relationship with precipitation over a three-year lagged period, which has been essentially unchanging from 1900 to present. Additionally, the DLM highlights an underlying lake level decline beginning in 1973 and continuing to the present, which may have been obscured by concurrently increasing precipitation into the 1990s. The current underlying decline might be related to a simultaneous evaporation increase, however, our model could not confirm this relationship, possibly due to the shorter period of record for evaporation data. We cannot be certain that the present observed water level drop is caused by factors related to global climate change, or that it portends a long-term problem. However, because the underlying decline has been ongoing for similar to 33 years it may be prudent to include lower lake levels in future management planning.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Qian, Song/I-6544-2012	Qian, Song/0000-0002-2346-4903; Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 15	2008	42	2					367	373		10.1021/es070664+	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es070664+								18284132					WOS:000252317700011

Northern lake impacts on local seasonal climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												It is well known that large lakes can perturb local weather and climate through mesoscale circulations, for example, lake effects on storms and lake breezes, and the impacts on fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum. However, for both large and small lakes, the importance of atmosphere- lake interactions in northern Canada is largely unknown. Here, the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) is used to simulate seasonal time scales for the Mackenzie River basin and northwest region of Canada, coupled to simulations of Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) to examine the interactions between large northern lakes and the atmosphere. The authors consider the lake impacts on the local water and energy cycles and on regional seasonal climate. Verification of model results is achieved with atmospheric sounding and surface flux data collected during the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) program. The coupled atmosphere-lake model is shown to be able to successfully simulate the variation of surface heat fluxes and surface water temperatures and to give a good representation of the vertical profiles of water temperatures, the warming and cooling processes, and the lake responses to the seasonal and interannual variation of surface heat fluxes. These northern lakes can significantly influence the local water and energy cycles.																			1525-755X					AUG	2007	8	4					881	896		10.1175/JHM591.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM591.1													WOS:000249354400018

Advanced remote sensing techniques make it possible to retrieve a range of land-surface variables, including radar retrieved soil moisture (SSM). It has been pointed out before that soil moisture retrieval from satellite data can be challenging at high latitudes, which correspond to remote areas where ground data are scarce and the applicability of satellite data of this type is essential. This study investigates backscatter variability other than associated with changing soil moisture in order to examine the possible impact on soil moisture retrieval. It focuses on issues specific to SSM retrieval in the Arctic, notably variations related to tundra lakes. ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Wide Swath (WS, 120 m) data are used to understand and quantify impacts on Metop (AAdvanced Scatterometer (ASCAT, 25 km) soil moisture retrieval during the snow free period. Sites of interest are chosen according to ASAR WS availability, high or low agreement between output from the land surface model ORCHIDEE and ASCAT derived SSM. Backscatter variations are analyzed with respect to the ASCAT footprint area. It can be shown that the low model agreement is related to water fraction in most cases. No difference could be detected between periods with floating ice (in snow off situation) and ice free periods at the chosen sites. The mean footprint backscatter is however impacted by partial short term surface roughness change. The water fraction correlates with backscatter deviations (relative to a smooth water surface reference image) within the ASCAT footprint areas (R = 0.91-0.97). Backscatter deviations of up to 5 dB can occur in areas with less than 50% water fraction and an assumed soil moisture related range (sensitivity) of 7 dB in the ASCAT data. The sensitivity is also positively correlated with water fraction in regions with low land-surface model agreement (R = 0.68). A precise quantification of the impact on soil moisture retrieval would, however, need to consider actual soil moisture changes and sensor differences. The study demonstrates that the usage of higher spatial resolution data than currently available for SSM is required in lowland permafrost environments.

The aim of our study was analyze the effect of the hydrosedimentological regime of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers on the interannual variation in the composition, biovolume and functional groups of phytoplankton in an isolated floodplain lake (Ventura Lagoon) of the Ivinhema River State Park, located in the Upper Parani River floodplain (Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil). Samples of phytoplankton were taken at the sub-surface of the pelagic zone of the lake from February 2000 to December 2005. A total of 132 taxa were recorded, and the species that represented greater contributions to the phytoplankton biovolume were grouped into five functional groups (FG) (H1, H2, M, MP and Y). The distribution of the FGs were linked to the high and low water periods in Ventura lagoon. Functional groups MP and Y were the highest contributors to the phytoplankton biovolume during the high water periods, whereas FGs H1, H2 and M contributed more during the low water periods. The FGs were also useful for the interannual characterization of Ventura Lagoon by taking the changes caused by climatological factors into account. There was a strong dominance of Cyanobacteria (H2 and M) in 2000 and 2001 (La Nina periods) coincident with low precipitation and low hydrometric levels of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers and, consequently, lower water depths of Ventura Lagoon. In 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (El Nino periods), when higher precipitation, higher hydrometric levels, higher discharge of the Parani and Ivinhema Rivers and an increased depth of Ventura Lagoon were observed, Cyanobacteria (H1, H2 and M) were dominant, followed by Bacillariophyceae (MP) and Cryptophyceae (Y). These results reported here corroborate the utility of using FGs as indicators of interannual and seasonal variability in floodplain lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2008	610						331	344		10.1007/s10750-008-9448-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9448-3													WOS:000257392300028

High-Resolution Spatio-Temporal Estimation of Net Ecosystem Exchange in Ice-Wedge Polygon Tundra Using In Situ Sensors and Remote Sensing Data	LAND												Land-atmosphere carbon exchange is known to be extremely heterogeneous in arctic ice-wedge polygonal tundra regions. In this study, a Kalman filter-based method was developed to estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of daytime average net ecosystem exchange (NEEday) at 0.5-m resolution over a 550 m by 700 m study site. We integrated multi-scale, multi-type datasets, including normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) obtained from a novel automated mobile sensor system (or tram system) and a greenness index map obtained from airborne imagery. We took advantage of the significant correlations between NDVI and NEEday identified based on flux chamber measurements. The weighted average of the estimated NEEday within the flux-tower footprint agreed with the flux tower data in term of its seasonal dynamics. We then evaluated the spatial variability of the growing season average NEEday, as a function of polygon geomorphic classes; i.e., the combination of polygon types-which are known to present different degradation stages associated with permafrost thaw-and microtopographic features (i.e., troughs, centers and rims). Our study suggests the importance of considering microtopographic features and their spatial coverage in computing spatially aggregated carbon exchange.

This study performed a laboratory-scale investigation using three submerged plants, namely Myriophyllum verticillatum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, and Najas minor to determine the response of submerged plants to seasonal changes and intermittent reclaimed water amendment. The three plants were pre-selected from seven commonly used submerged plants. Reclaimed water from a wastewater reclamation plant was used as raw water. The total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium, chemical oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen were monitored during the experiments to investigate their resistance to changes in water conditions. With seasonal changes from April to June, the water temperature ranged between 19 and 23 degrees C, and the TN and TP removal efficiencies were negatively affected. The highest TN and TP concentrations in the tanks with M. verticillatum and P. perfoliatus were reached on day 14. However, N. minor exhibited sustained growth, and the water quality remained in good condition. The TN and TP removal efficiencies were 81 and 62%, respectively. In addition, the intermittent reclaimed water amendment tests on the three plants yielded similar results. The TN and TP removal efficiencies of N. minor were 55 and 93%, respectively. N. minor proved to be a promising plant for water purification.

It's complicated: Heterogeneous patterns of genetic structure in five fish species from a fragmented river suggest multiple processes can drive differentiation	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Fragmentation of river systems by dams can have substantial genetic impacts on fish populations. However, genetic structure can exist naturally at small scales through processes other than isolation by physical barriers. We sampled individuals from five native fish species with varying life histories above and below a dam in the lower Boardman River, Michigan, USA, and used RADseq to investigate processes influencing genetic structure in this system. Species assessed were white sucker Catostomus commersonii, yellow perch Perca flavescens, walleye Sander vitreus, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, and rock bass Ambloplites rupestris. We detected significant differentiation within each species, but patterns of population structure varied substantially. Interestingly, genetic structure did not appear to be solely the result of fragmentation by the dam. While genetic structure in yellow perch and walleye generally coincided with "above dam" and "below dam" sampling locations, samples from our other three species did not. Specifically, samples from rock bass, smallmouth bass, and, to a much lesser extent, white sucker, aligned with a putative Great Lakes (GL) group that contained mostly individuals sampled below the dam and a putative Boardman River (BR) group that contained individuals sampled both above and below the dam, with some evidence of admixture among groups. We hypothesize that the GL and BR groups formed prior to dam construction and our samples largely represent a mixed stock that was sampled sympatrically outside of the spawning season. Support for this hypothesis is especially strong in smallmouth bass, where GL fish were 151 mm smaller than BR fish on average, suggesting a potential ontogenetic habitat shift of young GL fish into the lower river for feeding and/or refuge. Our study illuminates the complex dynamics shaping genetic structure in fragmented river systems and indicates that conclusions drawn for a single species cannot be generalized.

Density, parasitism, and sexual reproduction are strongly correlated in lake Daphnia populations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many organisms can reproduce both asexually and sexually. For cyclical parthenogens, periods of asexual reproduction are punctuated by bouts of sexual reproduction, and the shift from asexual to sexual reproduction has large impacts on fitness and population dynamics. We studied populations of Daphnia dentifera to determine the amount of investment in sexual reproduction as well as the factors associated with variation in investment in sex. To do so, we tracked host density, infections by nine different parasites, and sexual reproduction in 15 lake populations of D. dentifera for 3 years. Sexual reproduction was seasonal, with male and ephippial female production beginning as early as late September and generally increasing through November. However, there was substantial variation in the prevalence of sexual individuals across populations, with some populations remaining entirely asexual throughout the study period and others shifting almost entirely to sexual females and males. We found strong relationships between density, prevalence of infection, parasite species richness, and sexual reproduction in these populations. However, strong collinearity between density, parasitism, and sexual reproduction means that further work will be required to disentangle the causal mechanisms underlying these relationships.					; Duffy, Meghan/AFN-5376-2022	Rogalski, Mary/0000-0003-1728-3409; Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; 													2045-7758					AUG	2021	11	15					10446	10456		10.1002/ece3.7847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7847		JUN 2021						34367587					WOS:000667973500001

Cyanobacteria in a eutrophicated reservoir in a semi-arid region in Brazil: dominance and microcystin events of blooms	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In semi-arid regions, eutrophic waters and stable climatic conditions favor the dominance of cyanobacteria, with frequent blooms. In this study, we hypothesized that the biomass of cyanobacteria will be higher during the dry period and assessed toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the Argemiro de Figueiredo Reservoir (Paraiba, Brazil). We conducted 22 samplings between August 2007 and July 2009 at three sites (PC, confluence of tributaries; PNC, net cages; and PD, dam site). Significant seasonal and spatial differences were not observed for abiotic variables; however, reduction in pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and dissolved oxygen occurred only during overflow events in the reservoir. Filamentous cyanobacteria were dominant mainly in the dry period, accounting for 90 % of the total biomass; six of eight dominant or co-dominant species of cyanobacteria were observed to be potential producers of toxins. Planktothrix agardhii (Gomont) Anagnostidis & Komarek was dominant at PC, PNC, and PD and formed perennial blooms, and microcystin-LR was identified in 14 of 16 blooming events. Thus, we suggest that stable conditions, availability of nutrients, and a reduced light regime during the dry period favors blooms of cyanobacteria.					; Barbosa, Luciana/B-5817-2018	Lins, Ruceline/0000-0002-5303-5851; 													1806-9959					JUN	2016	39	2					583	591		10.1007/s40415-016-0267-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-016-0267-x													WOS:000378934700019
J	Leng, MJ; Barker, PA				Leng, MJ; Barker, PA			A review of the oxygen isotope composition of lacustrine diatom silica for palaeoclimate reconstruction	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS					2nd Meeting on Isotopes in Palaeoenvironmental Reconstruction	NOV, 2004	British Geol Survey, Nottingham, ENGLAND		British Geol Survey			Diatom silica (frustules) are a form of biogenic opal and contain oxygen isotopes that are being increasingly used in palaeoclimate studies. Frustules are comprised of an inner tetrahedrally bonded silica skeleton (Si-O-Si) with an outer, hydrous layer. The hydrous layer is freely exchangeable and must be removed prior to oxygen isotope measurement using oxidising reagents and/or high temperatures. Analysis of the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica requires samples that are almost pure diatomite since extraction techniques will liberate oxygen from all the components in the sediment. There is a generally acceptable protocol involving chemistry, sieving and settling techniques and more recently laminar flow separation. Recent studies of lacustrine diatoms have shown that even a small proportion of contaminant can have a significant influence on the oxygen isotope value. All lake sediments require their own specific procedure and every sample must be scrutinised by microscopy to check for the level of contamination prior to analysis. Where sediment cannot be purified sufficiently, a semi-quantitative assessment of the diatom content can facilitate mass balance techniques. When robust preparation methods are used, diatom silica offers an important palaeoclimate proxy, providing an additional complementary, rather than an alternative, host of oxygen isotopes in carbonates. In lacustrine isotope studies it is often assumed, but rarely proven, that diatom silica form in isotope equilibrium and hence empirically derived palaeotemperature equations, usually made in vitro, can be used. Most studies lack the detailed investigation of contemporaneous materials from natural waters of the region under study to test these equations. Further investigations need to be conducted in order to understand the systematic relationship between temperature, water isotope composition and diatom isotope composition to enable quantitative interpretation of the sediment record. Experiments to test for vital effects and inter-specific differences have so far revealed little variation. It is useful to know when and where the diatom silica is formed in the modem environment, so details of diatom ecology are important in the interpretation of isotope data. Here we show that valuable palaeoclimate data can be gained from the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica (delta O-17(diatom)), especially Since diatoms are abundant in many lakes sensitive to climate variation where other hosts (e.g., carbonates) are absent. To date the most successful studies have been conducted in areas where the delta O-18(diatom) registers changes in the oxygen isotope composition of the lake water (rather than temperature) which is then related to other aspects of climate. In these studies, the range of values obtained is often greater than the error introduced by contaminating materials. (c) 2005 NERC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The lakes are connected to the Parana and Paraguay Rivers Basins, and during wet seasons, the waters flow towards La Plata River estuary. Morphology of natural populations and cultures were analyzed using optical microscope, and 16S rDNA sequences were used for the BI and ML phylogenetic analysis. The morphological analysis shows that our populations fit in the original description of A. platensis, but with additional aerotopes. Also, it is evident that these structures are facultative and the species is planktonic, rather than benthic without aerotopes, as originally described. The phylogenetic analysis shows our strains in the monophyletic Limnospira clade. Considering that, in this paper we transfer the species A. platensis to the genus Limnospira, based on phylogenetic and morphological data. This new taxonomical combination is supported also by ecological data, and indicates that the species is more related and abundant in Pantanal, than in La Plata Basin, region from where it was originally described. According to our results, L. platensis is planktonic or benthic and typical from saline, alkaline and warm waters.

During the same period, local authorities have implemented a Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS) in the Yellow River for flood mitigation and delta restoration purposes. The altered hydrological regime has resulted in unintended changes to estuarine ecosystem. However, the direct consequence of the WSRS on the expansion of S. alterniflora remains unclear. In this study, quantitative relationship between the inter- and intra-annual expansion patterns of S. alterniflora represented by relevant landscape metrics and indicators that quantify the concurrent variations of river and sediment discharges as the proxy of the WSRS impacts were analysed over the period of Year 2011-2018, and the analyses were performed on the YRE as a whole and on five different zones subdivided based on the invasion sequence. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the inter-annual area variation of S. alterniflora between the years with and without WSRS. Compared with the years without WSRS (2016-2017), the intra-annual (monthly) increment of the various landscape metrics [i.e., NP (number of patches), CA (class area), LPI (largest patch index) and AI (aggregation index] were found to be significantly higher in the initial stage of peak growing season (June-July) than in the mid- and late stages (July-September) in the years with WSRS (2011-2015, 2018) in the subregion located close to the south bank of YRE as the most prominent impact zone. In addition, F (mean flow), Ff (number of high flow pulses), Tf (Julian date of maximum flow) and D (duration of WSRS) were identified as the explanatory variables for the intra-annual vegetation landscape pattern changes, and their relative contributions to resultant changes were also assessed. Our results broaden the understanding of estuarine hydrological disturbance as a potential driver regulating the saltmarsh vegetation, and also have implications for S. alterniflora invasion control at estuaries under changing environment.					zheng, shaoyan/AAE-6732-2021; Wang, Andong/N-6525-2018															2296-665X				JUN 28	2021	9								642442	10.3389/fenvs.2021.642442	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.642442													WOS:000671828300001

In such ecosystems, assessments of water quality cannot be made without sufficient knowledge of water temperature and currents. In the case of the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, this information was provided by a modelling approach using the Delft3D FLOW software. Between June 2008 and 2010, measured surface and bottom water temperatures ranged from 18.1 to 31.8 degrees C and from 16.0 to 25.1 degrees C, respectively. The mean absolute errors between the observed and the computed temperatures were between 0.54 and 1.02 degrees C at the surface and between 0.67 and 0.86 degrees C at the bottom. Larger errors were modelled when a high vertical temperature gradient was present but, the seasonal patterns were properly simulated, especially the stratification and destratification periods. The model was most sensitive to the vertical eddy viscosity and the Ozmidov length scale. Current velocities were also properly simulated both in absolute value, direction and profile shape. The maximum error (0.09 m s(-1)) occurred close to the bottom of the Headrace Channel where the highest speed was measured (around 0.2 m s(-1)), but the average error was less than 0.02 m s(-1). Until May 2010 (beginning of normal operation), currents were mainly oriented north-westward. Then, flows were diverted towards the water intake with very low velocities in the downstream part of the reservoir. Although used here for a large reservoir, a similar modelling approach can also be very useful to the understanding of natural large lake ecosystems.

They are also parameters widely used to compare the condition of aquatic systems with varying degrees of human intervention. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of populations in pristine ecosystems, provides relevant basic information to understanding changes or effects in populations under these pressures. The San Pedro river (Valdivia basin), southern Chile, is a system characterized by its current low intervention level, high fish diversity and low abundance of introduced species. We describe the length-weight relationship and condition factor of 12 native fish of the San Pedro river, for over two annual cycles, analyzing their growth strategies and seasonal variability in condition factor. The results of the length-weight show that the most of species exhibit isometric growth, especially Diplomystes camposensis, Basilichthys australis and Brachygalaxias bullocki, however, some species have a tendency to allometry (Galaxias maculatus, Galaxias platei and Trichomycterus areolatus). The values of K show that species such as Percilia gillissi have a strong annual variability, associated with the breeding season and greater supply of food. We give this information as baseline data to understand the functioning of fish populations in natural conditions and to be used for the evaluation of future projects that may impact these ecosystems.

We used flow cytometry to characterize freshwater photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) in Lake Kivu, one of the East-African great lakes. Throughout three cruises run in different seasons, covering the four major basins, phycoerythrin-rich cells dominated the PPP. Heterotrophic bacteria and PPP cell numbers were always high and spatial variations were modest. This represents an important difference from temperate and high latitude lakes that show high fluctuations in cell abundance over an annual cycle. 2. Three populations of picocyanobacteria were identified: one corresponded to single-cells (identified as Synechococcus by epifluorescence microscopy, molecular methods and pigment content), and the two other that most probably correspond to two and four celled colonies of the same taxon. The proportion of these two subpopulations was greater under stratified conditions, with stronger nutrient limitation. 3. High PPP concentrations (c. 10(5) cell mL(-1)) relative to HB (c. 10(6) cell mL(-1)) were always found. Lake Kivu supports relatively less bacteria than phytoplankton biomass than temperate systems, probably as a consequence of factors such as temperature, oligotrophy, nutrient limitation and trophic structure. 4. A review of PPP concentration across aquatic systems suggests that the abundance of Synechococcus-like cyanobacteria in large, oligotrophic, tropical lakes is very high. 5. Photosynthetic picoplankton cell abundances in the oligotrophic tropical lakes Kivu and Tanganyika are comparable to those of eutrophic temperate lakes. This apparently contradicts the view that PPP abundance increases with increasing eutrophy. More data on PPP in tropical lakes are needed to explore further this particular pattern.

In order to understand the phytoplankton community structure and its relationship with the environmental variables in the shallow hypersaline Pulicat lagoon, east coast of India, observations were carried out during August 2018-January 2019 covering the three seasons: premonsoon (PrM), monsoon (M), and postmonsoon (PoM). The salinity of the lagoon varied with a minimum of 12.1 for the M and a maximum of 81.65 during the PoM. The clustering analysis performed on the phytoplankton abundance data separated the lagoon into three sectors: north sector (NS), central sector (CS), and south sector (SS). A total of 59 taxa/morphotypes from four taxonomic classes (Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, and Dinophyceae) were recorded during the study period. The class Bacillariophyceae was dominant in the lagoon both spatially and temporally by 44.06% with Chaetoceros borealis as dominant species. Presence of characteristic species like Dunaliella sp. was observed in the higher salinity, whereas Pediastrum duplex and Scenedesmus sp. were dominant in the freshwater influx areas. The individual-based functional approach allowed grouping these taxa into 11 functional entities based on the derived 4 functional trait values (cell size, trophic regime, mobility, and coloniality). Formation of algal blooms of Protoperidinium sp. (3.3x10(5)ind L-1) and Odentella sp. (2.8x10(5)ind L-1) was observed in the SS during PoM as a result of reduced water exchange in the lagoon. During the same period, toxin-producing strains like Anabaena sp. and Nostoc sp. of Cyanophyceae were also recorded. Correlating the three sectors of the lake (NS, CS, and SS), it is observed that the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the lake varied continuously depending on the season and freshwater availability. Seasonal nutrient stoichiometry played a significant role in regulating the community structure and distribution pattern of phytoplankton communities of the lagoon.

J	Shakoor, A; Ejaz, N				Shakoor, Abdul; Ejaz, Naeem			Flow Analysis at the Snow Covered High Altitude Catchment via Distributed Energy Balance Modeling	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Energy budget-based distributed modeling at high-altitude glacio-nival watersheds is essential to accurately describe hydrological processes and quantify the flow rates. In this study, SNOWPACK model and its distributed version Alpine3D are applied for the first time in Pakistan to simulate the runoff response of a high altitude glaciated catchment. The basic aim was to explore the feasibility of this modeling system and its future applications in the region. Final results demonstrated satisfactory performance of the model between measured and modeled discharges with Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency of 0.54. However, total simulated flow volume differs only 1.3 times as compared to measured discharge of the lake, located at the glacier snout. Flow composition analysis revealed that the runoff regime of the study site is strongly influenced by the snow and glacier melt runoff representing 53% snowmelt and 38% glacier melt contribution. Low model efficiency has been observed during glacier melting season due to inaccurate wind speed distribution and biased input met-data. It is concluded that high performance of this model can be achieved if the model is optimized over the catchment similar to the study site provided with long term data sets. This study leaves a firm foundation for the potential application of a highly accurate distributed energy balance model in the entire Karakoram and Himalaya region to understand the melt dynamics of such a rugged terrain glacier rich mountains.

J	Zhao, C; Yu, ZC; Ito, E; Zhao, Y				Zhao, Cheng; Yu, Zicheng; Ito, Emi; Zhao, Yan			Holocene climate trend, variability, and shift documented by lacustrine stable-isotope record in the northeastern United States	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Earlier studies indicated that the general pattern of the Holocene climate in the northeastern United States changed from cool and dry (11.6-8.2 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP) to warm and wet (8.2-5.4 ka) to warm and dry (5.4-3 ka) to cool and wet (after 3 ka). A new similar to 35-year resolution stable isotope record of endogenic calcite from a sediment core for Lake Grinnell in northern New Jersey provided a chance to examine the Holocene climate variations of the region in a finer detail. After the Younger Dryas cold climate reversal, the delta O-18 fluctuated around a constant value of 7.4 parts per thousand until 5.8 ka, thereafter shifted to a steadily decreasing trend to the most recent value of -8.2 parts per thousand. Responding to this shift, the widely observed hemlock decline in the northeastern USA occurred about similar to 350-500 (+/- 143.5) years later. Detrended delta O-18 and delta C-13 records show a clear covariance at 910-year periodicity. The amplitudes of centennial-scale 6180 variations became much smaller after 4.7 ka. At the same time, the dominant frequency of these variations changed from 330 to 500 years. We suggest that a non-linear response of atmospheric circulation to the gradual decrease in insolation is responsible for the shift in the climate trend at 5.8 ka as indicated by the deceasing delta O-18 values. A dominant frequency shift in solar forcing and the decreased seasonal contrast of insolation might have caused the change in climate variability at 4.7 ka through modulating ocean and atmosphere circulations.

J	Meng, ZH; Chen, K; Hu, FF; Liu, L; Yang, DG; Li, XM				Meng, Zihao; Chen, Kang; Hu, Feifei; Liu, Lu; Yang, Deguo; Li, Xuemei			Environmental and spatial factors play different roles in phytoplankton community assembly in different hydrological seasons in Lake Wuchang, China	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Lake phytoplankton communities are affected by environmental and spatial factors. We studied the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors on the phytoplankton community assembly in Lake Wuchang across three hydrological seasons, which were divided into dry (December to March), normal (April to June, October to November) and wet seasons (July to September) based on the water level and depth. Spatial and temporal patterns of environmental factors and phytoplankton community composition and diversity were studied using Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon test and NMDS. CCA, Mantel and partial Mantel tests, and PLS-PM were used to investigate the effects of environmental and spatial factors on phytoplankton community characteristics. Results showed that phytoplankton assemblages at the eight study sites were composed of totally 244 species belonging to 9 phyla, which changed from Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta to Cyanophyta across the whole hydrological period. There was significantly higher abundance and biomass in the normal and wet seasons than that in the dry season. Phytoplankton alpha diversity exhibited uniform temporal distribution patterns with higher values in the dry season than in the normal and wet seasons. The Mantel and partial Mantel tests revealed that environmental (physicochemical conditions of lake water) and spatial factors (geographic distances among sites) jointly affected the phytoplankton community structure and beta diversity across the hydrological seasons, while spatial factors were more important in the wet season. Partial least squares path models showed that spatial factors exhibited a significant positive correlation with the phytoplankton diversity with the path coefficients of 0.53 and 0.71 in the normal and wet seasons, respectively. Phytoplankton composition had significant correlation with on phytoplankton diversity with the path coefficient of -0.75 and 0.61 in the normal and wet seasons, respectively. Our findings revealed that both environmental and spatial factors affected the phytoplankton community assembly in Lake Wuchang. Environmental factors played a more important role in the dry season, while spatial factors were more important in the wet season. With the exception of the abiotic factors (environmental and spatial), the impacts of biotic factors on phytoplankton community cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen further research on the top-down control over phytoplankton communities in Lake Wuchang.

J	Atakoglu, OO; Yalcin, F				Atakoglu, Ozge Ozer; Yalcin, Fusun			Evaluation of the surface water and sediment quality in the Duger basin (Burdur, Turkey) using multivariate statistical analyses and identification of heavy metals	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The study aims to determine the chemical contents of the surface water of the Duger Creek and the sediments of the Duger basin, which feeds the Burdur Lake, the correlation between these contents, the potential ecological risks of these contents, the toxic heavy metal contents, and their spatial distribution by using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy method. The Duger basin, which has been selected as the study area, is located on the streams feeding the Burdur Lake, which has been determined as the Ramsar area in Turkey. Burdur Lake has a key role in the ecological balance due to its biological diversity, characteristic animal/plant fauna since it provides a suitable area for seasonal migration of waterfowl. Considering all these functions, the surface water and sediment quality of the Duger basin, which is located in the streams feeding Burdur Lake, is critical. In this study, elemental compositions of 20 water and 20 sediment samples collected from the Duger basin were determined by using the XRF spectroscopy method. Many elements that may have toxicological characteristics in terms of human and environmental health have been detected in the surface water and sediment samples from the Duger basin. These elements were found to have the following average values: Al (60.09 mg/L), Co (3.35 mg/L), Zn (3.35 mg/L), Cu (2.21 mg/L), Cr (0.14 mg/L). It is interpreted that they may be toxic because they exceed the limits specified in WHO 2004. In this context, the surface water in the Duger basin, which feeds the Burdur Lake, must be filtered before using it as drinking water or for agricultural and livestock purposes. New strategic planning is suggested to ensure the sustainability of the basin's surface water quality.

Field Application of Spent Lime Water Treatment Residual for the Removal of Phosphorus and other Pollutants in Urban Stormwater Runoff	WATER												The threat of anthropogenic eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in lakes requires the development of innovative stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the external loading of phosphorus (P). This paper presents the findings of a 5-year study of a full-scale P removal structure constructed in Minnesota, USA with spent lime drinking water treatment residual (DWTR), a by-product of water softening at a local water treatment plant. Influent and effluent water samples were collected by auto-samplers during 43 storm events during the growing season. Samples were analyzed for P constituents, heavy metals, total suspended solids (TSS), and pH. Toxicity of the effluent was assessed using Ceriodaphnia dubia. Flow-weighted removal effectiveness was calculated for each storm event. Overall, the spent lime DWTR reduced total P loading by 70.9%, dissolved reactive P by 78.5%, dissolved P by 74.7%, and TSS by 58.5%. A significant reduction in heavy metals was also observed. Toxicity tests indicated the aquatic toxicity of the effluent treated with spent lime DWTR was not different from untreated stormwater. This study provided long-term real-world data that demonstrated that a full-scale P removal structure with spent lime DWTR significantly reduced P and other pollutants in stormwater discharging to an urban lake. Therefore, spent lime DWTR, which is currently treated as a waste product, is a promising filter material for stormwater treatment.

This study was developed to evaluate phytoplankton response to trophic state and seasonal differences of environmental filters (dry and rainy periods) using the morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) approach. We also aimed at identifying environmental thresholds of each MBFG dominance in six man-made lakes located in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. Our results showed clear MBFG association with lakes' trophic states. The dominant groups in mesotrophic conditions were members of MBFGs V (unicellular flagellates) and VI (non-flagellated with a siliceous exoskeleton), and in meso-eutrophic MBFG IV (medium size without specialized traits) dominated. Conversely, MBFG VII (with mucilage and aerotopes) and VIII (nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) dominated mostly under eutrophic conditions, though linked to shallower euphotic zones. Light and phosphorous were the most important environmental thresholds associated with MBFG's dominance. Overall, most of the lakes displayed seasonal differences in environmental filters. In contrast to what was expected, the rainy season was associated with higher nutrients, suspended solids, and reduced euphotic depth compared to the dry season. Our results, overall, show that the effects of seasonality varied across lakes and highlight eutrophication as the main environmental factor for MBFG selection suggesting reduced seasonality effects during dry years in the tropics.

Water samples were collected during the dry season on March 2013. Bacterial and archaeal communities were profiled using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) approach of the 16S rRNA gene. The results indicate a stratification of both communities along the water column. Altogether, the physico-chemical data and microbial sequences suggest a close correspondence of the potential microbial functions to the physico-chemical pattern of the lake. We also obtained evidence of a rich microbial diversity likely to include several novel microorganisms of environmental importance in the large unexplored microbial reservoir of Lake Nyos.

John; Simpson, Gavin; Jones, Vivienne; Whiteford, Erika			Spatial variations in snowpack chemistry, isotopic composition of NO3- and nitrogen deposition from the ice sheet margin to the coast of western Greenland	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The relative roles of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition and climate change in causing ecological change in remote Arctic ecosystems, especially lakes, have been the subject of debate over the last decade. Some palaeoecological studies have cited isotopic signals (delta N-15)) preserved in lake sediments as evidence linking N deposition with ecological change, but a key limitation has been the lack of co-located data on both deposition input fluxes and isotopic composition of deposited nitrate (NO3-). In Arctic lakes, including those in western Greenland, previous palaeolimnological studies have indicated a spatial variation in delta(N-15) trends in lake sediments but data are lacking for deposition chemistry, input fluxes and stable isotope composition of NO3-. In the present study, snowpack chemistry, NO3- stable isotopes and net deposition fluxes for the largest ice-free region in Greenland were investigated to determine whether there are spatial gradients from the ice sheet margin to the coast linked to a gradient in precipitation. Late-season snowpack was sampled in March 2011 at eight locations within three lake catchments in each of three regions (ice sheet margin in the east, the central area near Kelly Ville and the coastal zone to the west). At the coast, snowpack accumulation averaged 181mm snow water equivalent (SWE) compared with 36mm SWE by the ice sheet. Coastal snowpack showed significantly greater concentrations of marine salts (Na+, Cl-, other major cations), ammonium (NH4+; regional means 1.4-2.7 mu mol L-1), total and non-sea-salt sulfate (SO42-; total 1.8-7.7, non-sea-salt 1.0-1.8 mu mol L-1/than the two inland regions. Nitrate (1.5-2.4 mu mol L-1/showed significantly lower concentrations at the coast. Despite lower concentrations, higher precipitation at the coast results in greater net deposition for NO3- as well as NH4+ and non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO42-) relative to the inland regions (lowest at Kelly Ville 6, 4 and 3; highest at coast 9, 17 and 11 mol ha(-1) a(-1) of NO3-, NH4+ and nss-SO42- respectively). The delta(N-15) of snowpack NO3- shows a significant decrease from inland regions (5.7 parts per thousand at Kelly Ville) to the coast (-11.3 parts per thousand). We attribute the spatial patterns of delta(N-15) in western Greenland to post-depositional processing rather than differing sources because of (1) spatial relationships with precipitation and sublimation, (2) within catchment isotopic differences between terrestrial snowpack and lake ice snowpack, and (3) similarities between fresh snow (rather than accumulated snowpack) at Kelly Ville and the coast. Hence the delta(N-15) of coastal snowpack is most representative of snowfall in western Greenland, but after deposition the effects of photolysis, volatilization and sublimation lead to enrichment of the remaining snowpack with the greatest effect in inland areas of low precipitation and high sublimation losses.

A spatially explicit statistical model to quantify nutrient sources, pathways, and delivery at the regional scale	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nutrient loading has been linked to many issues including eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and decreases in aquatic species diversity. In order to develop mitigation strategies to control nutrient sources, the relative contribution and spatial distribution of nutrient sources must be quantified. Though many watershed nutrient models exist in the literature, there is generally a tradeoff between the scale of the model and the level of detail regarding the individual sources of nutrients and basin transport and fate characteristics. To examine the link between watershed nutrient sources, landscape processes, and instream loads in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, a spatially explicit nutrient loading model was developed. The model uses spatially explicit descriptions of nutrient sources and a novel statistical model describing spatially-explicit nutrient attenuation along transport pathways to predict total nitrogen and phosphorus loads. Observations collected during baseflow and melt conditions from 2010-2012 were used to calibrate and validate the model. The model predicts nutrient loads, provides information on the sources of nutrients within each watershed, and estimates the relative contribution of different sources to the overall nutrient load. The model results indicate that there is a high degree of variability in seasonal nutrient export rates, which can be significantly greater during snow melt conditions than during baseflow. In addition, the model highlights the considerable variability in seasonal pathways and processes that impact nutrient delivery. The model performance compares favorably to other regional scale nutrient models. This work has the potential to provide valuable information to environmental managers regarding how and where to target efforts to reduce nutrient loads in surface water.

An analysis of the relationship between phytoplankton internal stoichiometry and water column N:P ratios in a dynamic lake environment	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The N:P stoichiometry of a water body is one of the most commonly used indicators of its nutrient status and algal growth. However, in a dynamic aquatic ecosystem the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton is highly variable and depends on environmental conditions and key microbial interactions that influence their growth, such as grazing pressures and the microbial loop. Here we determine the influence of the nutrient-dependent microbial interactions between zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria on the ecological stoichiometry at different trophic levels and how they relate to water column properties. A 1D hydrodynamic-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was applied to Lake Kinneret (Israel) for examining how the internal nutrient ratios of several phytoplankton functional groups correlate with nutrient ratios within the water column, and further explore how the microbial loop shapes the patterns of stoichiometry within the food web by testing two microbial loop configurations. The results showed that the average internal N:P ratios of the phytoplankton community followed their total carbon biomass patterns, and that seasonal patterns of simulated dissolved inorganic N to total P (DIN:TP) ratios in the water column were a useful indicator for reflecting the bulk phytoplankton N:P stoichiometry as compared with total N to total P (TN:TP) ratios and dissolved inorganic N to dissolved inorganic P (DIN:DIP) ratios. However, the internal N:P ratio patterns of individual phytoplankton groups did not necessarily correlate with DIN:TP ratio patterns in the water column. This was because different microbial processes regulate nutrient flows to individual phytoplankton groups. Our simulations with the microbial loop highlight the ability of bacteria to regulate phytoplankton stoichiometry. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the food web in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Field Measurements and Modeling of Ebullition-Facilitated Flux of Heavy Metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Sediments to the Water Column	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Gas ebullition-facilitated transport of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from sediment was investigated in 14 urban waterway locations. Gas ebullition varied widely over four seasons (range 2-450 mmol m(-2) d(-1), mean 140 +/- 90 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and was highly temperature dependent Ebullition-facilitated metal fluxes were large: 50 +/- 13 mg m(-2) d(-1) (Fe), 2.6 +/- 0.71 mg m(-2) d(-1) (Zn), 1.5 +/- 0.28 mg m(-2) d(-1) (Pb), and 0.19 +/- 0.06 mg m(-2) d(-1) (Cr). Ebullition-facilitated PAH fluxes were also large: 0.61 +/- 0.27 mg m(-2) d(-1) for anthracene, 0.65 +/- 0.28 m(-2) d(-2) d(-1) for benzo[a]pyrene, 0.72 +/- 0.28 mg m(-2) d(-1) for chrysene, 3.51 +/- 1.23 mg m(-2) d(-1) for fluoranthene, 0.23 +/- 0.08 mg m(-2) d(-1) for naphthalene, 3.84 +/- 1.47 mg m(-2) d(-1) for phenanthrene, and 2.46 +/- 0.86 mg m(-2) d(-1) for pyrene. The magnitude of these fluxes indicates that gas ebullition is an important pathway for release of both PAHs and heavy metals from buried sediments Multivariate regression analysis of the in situ gas ebullition flux and ebullition facilitated contaminant flux suggests that metal transport likely is due to sediment particle resuspension, whereas PAH transport is due to both contaminant partitioning to gas bubbles and to sediment resuspension. These results indicate that assumptions regarding the natural recovery potential of ebullition active sediments should be made with caution.

J	Terada, A; Hashimoto, T; Kagiyama, T				Terada, Akihiko; Hashimoto, Takeshi; Kagiyama, Tsuneomi			A water flow model of the active crater lake at Aso volcano, Japan: fluctuations of magmatic gas and groundwater fluxes from the underlying hydrothermal system	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The first crater of Nakadake, peak of Aso volcano, Japan, contains a hot water lake that shows interesting variations in water level and temperature. These variations were discovered by precise, continuous observations of the lake independent of precipitation. We developed a numerical model of a hot crater lake and compared with observational data for the period from July 2006 to January 2009. The numerical model revealed seasonal changes in mass flux (75-132 kg/s) and enthalpy (1,840-3,030 kJ/kg) for the fluid supplied to the lake. The relation between the enthalpy and mass flux indicates that the bottom input fluid is a mixture of high- and low-temperature fluids. Assuming a mixture of high-temperature steam at 800A degrees C and liquid water at 100A degrees C, we evaluated the liquid and steam fluxes. The liquid water flux shows a seasonal increase lagging behind the rainy season by 2 months, suggesting that the liquid water is predominantly groundwater. The fluctuation pattern in the flux of the high-temperature steam shows a relation with the amplitude of volcanic tremor, suggesting that heating of the hydrothermal system drives the tremor. Consequently, precise observations of a hot crater lake represent a potential method of monitoring volcanic hydrothermal systems in the shallow parts of the volcanoes.					; Hashimoto, Takeshi/E-2340-2012	Terada, Akihiko/0000-0001-5746-4912; 													0258-8900					APR	2012	74	3					641	655		10.1007/s00445-011-0550-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-011-0550-4													WOS:000301793300002

The hydro-chemistry of the Deepor Beel lake reveals the dominance of carbonate weathering with strong evidences of ion-exchange reaction occurring throughout the monsoon season of 2014 and 2015. Through an integrated application of multivariate analysis, the occurrence of albite weathering was confirmed, although as an isolated incidence only, along-with substantial evidence of waste water intrusion from fertilizer industries. The moderate cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil, indicates the presence of illite, chlorite and kaolinite which provides a strong buffering action in terms of phosphorous and nutrient retention. However, occurrences of chemical waste in the form of bleaching powder (Ca (OCl)2) are causing acidification of lake soil, which will trigger the release of phosphorous and may enhance the eutrophication level in near future. Through the simulations of Biotic Ligand (BL) model on ceriodaphnia dubia, it is being revealed, that the free availability of Ca2+ in the lake water, provides a higher adsorptive competition for labile metal species especially for Cu and Zn. Additionally, the risk among children from drinking lake water, has increased by three to seven times in a duration of just one year. The present study is a pioneering work, which has evaluated the vulnerability of Deepor Beel lake by adopting a sequential assessment strategy of lake internal as well as external ecology. Our proposed methodology can be a used as a scientific basis for future assessment of the lake health.					kumar, manish/KIE-1953-2024; Karunanidhi, D/AAW-6216-2021; Singh, Ashwin/AAV-2846-2021														0013-9351	1096-0953				SEP	2021	200								111397	10.1016/j.envres.2021.111397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111397		JUN 2021						34111439					WOS:000690870200003

Divergence of gastropod life history in contrasting thermal environments in a geothermal lake	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Experiments using natural populations have provided mixed support for thermal adaptation models, probably because the conditions are often confounded with additional environmental factors like seasonality. The contrasting geothermal environments within Lake Myvatn, northern Iceland, provide a unique opportunity to evaluate thermal adaptation models using closely located natural populations. We conducted laboratory common garden and field reciprocal transplant experiments to investigate how thermal origin influences the life history of Radix balthica snails originating from stable cold (6 degrees C), stable warm (23 degrees C) thermal environments or from areas with seasonal temperature variation. Supporting thermal optimality models, warm-origin snails survived poorly at 6 degrees C in the common garden experiment and better than cold-origin and seasonal-origin snails in the warm habitat in the reciprocal transplant experiment. Contrary to thermal adaptation models, growth rate in both experiments was highest in the warm populations irrespective of temperature, indicating cogradient variation. The optimal temperatures for growth and reproduction were similar irrespective of origin, but cold-origin snails always had the lowest performance, and seasonal- origin snails often performed at an intermediate level compared to snails originating in either stable environment. Our results indicate that central life-history traits can differ in their mode of evolution, with survival following the predictions of thermal optimality models, whereas ecological constraints have shaped the evolution of growth rates in local populations.

The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to advance a sensitive method for simultaneous rapid detection of perchlorate and bromate in drinking water system, (2) to systematically study the occurrence of these two contaminants in Missouri drinking water treatment systems, and (3) to examine effective sorbents for minimizing perchlorate in drinking water. A rapid high-performance ion exchange chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPIC-MS/MS) method was advanced for simultaneous detection of perchlorate and bromate in drinking water. The HPIC-MS/MS method was rapid, required no preconcentration of the water samples, and had detection limits for perchlorate and bromate of 0.04 and 0.01 mu g/L, respectively. The method was applied to determine perchlorate and bromate concentrations in total of 23 selected Missouri drinking water treatment systems during differing seasons. The water systems selected include different source waters: groundwater, lake water, river water, and groundwater influenced by surface water. The concentrations of perchlorate and bromate were lower than or near to method detection limits in most of the drinking water samples monitored. The removal of perchlorate by various adsorbents was studied. A cationic organoclay (TC-99) exhibited effective removal of perchlorate from drinking water matrices.

Modelling the Caspian Sea and its catchment area using a coupled regional atmosphere-ocean model (RegCM4-ROMS): model design and preliminary results	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												We describe the development of a coupled regional atmosphere-ocean model (RegCM4-ROMS) and its implementation over the Caspian Sea basin. The coupled model is run for the period 1999-2008 (after a spin up of 4 yr) and it is compared to corresponding stand alone model simulations and a simulation in which a distributed 1d lake model is run for the Caspian Sea. All model versions show a good performance in reproducing the climatology of the Caspian Sea basin, with relatively minor differences across them. The coupled ROMS produces realistic, although somewhat overestimated, Caspian Sea Surface Temperature (SST), with a considerable improvement compared to the use of the simpler coupled lake model. Simulated near surface salinity and sea currents are also realistic, although the upwelling over the eastern coastal regions is underestimated. The sea ice extent over the shallow northern shelf of the Caspian Sea and its seasonal evolution are well reproduced, however, a significant negative bias in sea-ice fraction exists due to the relatively poor representation of the bathymetry. ROMS also calculates the Caspian Sea Level (CSL), showing that for the present experiment excessive evaporation over the lake area leads to a drift in estimated CSL. Despite this problem, which requires further analysis due to many uncertainties in the estimation of CSL, overall the coupled RegCM4-ROMS system shows encouraging results in reproducing both the climatology of the region and the basic characteristics of the Caspian Sea.

A qualitative ecological risk assessment of the invasive Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus in a sub-tropical African river system (Limpopo River, South Africa)	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												This study outlines the development of a qualitative risk assessment method and its application as a screening tool for determining the risk of establishment and spread of the invasive Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758), within the central sub-catchment of the Limpopo River basin in northern South Africa. The assessment used known physiological tolerance limits of O. niloticus in relation to minimum water temperature, presence or absence of dams, seasonality of river flows, and the presence of indigenous fish species of concern to identify river systems that would be suitable for O. niloticus establishment. River sections along the Limpopo main river channel and the immediate reaches of its associated tributaries east of the Limpopo/Lephalala river confluence along the BotswanaSouth AfricaZimbabwe border were identified as being highly vulnerable to O. niloticus invasion. Rivers in the upper Bushveld catchment (Upper Limpopo, Mogalakwena, Lephalala, Mokolo, Matlabas and Crocodile rivers) were categorized as of medium ecological risk, while headwater streams were considered to be of low ecological risk. The decrease in vulnerability between lowveld and highveld river sections was mainly a function of low water temperatures (812 degrees C) associated with increasing altitude. Oreochromis niloticus is already established in the lower catchment of the Limpopo River basin where indigenous congenerics are at an extinction risk through hybridization and competition exclusion. Oreochromis niloticus, therefore, poses an ecologically unacceptable risk to river systems in the upper catchment where it is yet to establish. The current risk assessment model provides a useful preliminary framework for the identification of river systems that are vulnerable to an O. niloticus invasion where conservation measures should be directed and implemented to prevent its introduction and spread within the Limpopo river system.

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) model analysis and G plus GE interaction (GGE) biplots, obtained from sites regression (SREG) model analysis in interpreting GE grain yield data. Replicated grain yield data of six rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars (Cocodrie, Cypress, Jefferson, Lemont, Saber, and Wells) from three main cropping seasons (2000, 2001, and 2002) at four locations in Texas, USA (Bay City, Eagle Lake, Ganado, and Beaumont) were obtained and used for this purpose. Through AMMI model analysis, the magnitude and significance of the effects of GE interaction and its interaction principal components relative to the effects of G and E were estimated. The stability and adaptability of specific cultivars were assessed by plotting their nominal grain yields at specific environments in an AMMI biplot, which aided in the identification of mega-environments (environments with the same highest yielding cultivar). Appropriate check cultivars for all locations or for specific locations were identified. Through GGE biplots of SREG model analysis results, the relative yield performance of cultivars at a specific environment were illustrated, the performance of a cultivar at different environments was compared, the performance of two cultivars at different environments were compared, the highest yielding cultivars at the different mega-environments were identified, and ideal cultivars and test locations were identified.					; Wilson, Lloyd/E-9971-2011	Samonte, Stanley Omar/0000-0001-7628-6824; 													0011-183X					NOV-DEC	2005	45	6					2414	2424		10.2135/cropsci2004.0627	http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.0627													WOS:000233147100034

The classification of the ciliated communities based on the analysis of the distribution of ciliate population density in the lake along the oxygen gradients, taking into account their oxygen preferences, was proposed. It was shown that the distribution of ciliated protozoa in the space of a reservoir is determined not by such spatial units as the water column, bottom, and periphytal, but by the oxygen gradients. Four types of habitats with different oxygen regimes were distinguished: With stably high oxygen concentration, stably low oxygen concentration, stably oxygen-free conditions, and conditions with a high amplitude of diurnal oxygen variations. The location of these habitats in the space of the lake and their seasonal changes were determined. On the basis of the quantitative development of ciliate populations, zones of optima and tolerance ranges of some ciliate species in the oxygen gradient were established. The oxygen preferences were established for the species from four distinguished assemblages: Microoxyphilic, oxyphilic, euryoxyphilic, and anoxyphilic (anaerobic). The presence or the absence of a certain type of assemblage in the reservoirs depends solely on the parameters of the oxygen gradients. The diversity of the ciliated protozoa in water bodies also depends on the stability and diversity of the oxygen gradients.					; Szulzyk-Cieplak, Joanna/C-1148-2017; Lagod, Grzegorz/D-5199-2017; Kuzmina, Tetiana/CAI-2762-2022; Łagód, Grzegorz/D-5199-2017; Danko, Yaroslav/AAF-2534-2019	Babko, Roman/0000-0002-3292-5580; Szulzyk-Cieplak, Joanna/0000-0002-2428-0364; Lagod, Grzegorz/0000-0002-0621-7222; Kuzmina, Tatiana/0009-0001-1286-5701; 														2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2084	10.3390/w12082084	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082084													WOS:000567251300001

This study examined differences in bacterioplankton community structures between wet (July and September) and dry (October and November) seasons in two consecutive years (2016 and 2017) in Poyang Lake, the largest seasonal freshwater lake in China. Our results revealed no overall difference in bacterioplankton compositions and their predicted functions among spatially separated sites. However, bacterioplankton communities did show significant temporal shifts, mainly between samples in November and other months. Transitions from the dry to the wet season were observed in October in both sampling years. Meanwhile, insignificant spatial but significant temporal differences were also found for physicochemical variables. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicates that compared with water depth, water temperature was found to better explain changes in the bacterioplankton community. These findings consistently indicate that the bacterioplankton community in Poyang Lake is relatively less sensitive to annual hydrology shifts than water temperature and nutrient conditions.

The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was developed to simulate and predict daily streamflow for high mountain basins where snowmelt runoff is a major contributor. However, there are many sources of uncertainty when using an SRM for hydrological simulations, such as low-quality input data, imperfect model structure and model parameters, and uncertainty from climate scenarios. Among these, the identification of model parameters is considered to be one of the major sources of uncertainty. This study evaluates the parameter uncertainty for SRM simulation based on different calibration strategies, as well as its impact on future hydrological projections in a data-scarce deglaciating river basin. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method implemented by Monte Carlo sampling was used to estimate the model uncertainty arising from parameters calibrated by means of different strategies. Future snowmelt runoff projections under climate change impacts in the middle of the century and their uncertainty were assessed using average annual hydrographs, annual discharge and flow duration curves as the evaluation criteria. The results show that: (1) the strategy with a division of one or two sub-period(s) in a hydrological year is more appropriate for SRM calibration, and is also more rational for hydrological climate change impact assessment; (2) the multi-year calibration strategy is also more stable; and (3) the future runoff projection contains a large amount of uncertainty, among which parameter uncertainty plays a significant role. The projections also indicate that the onset of snowmelt runoff is likely to shift earlier in the year, and the discharge over the snowmelt season is projected to increase. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the parameter uncertainty of time-varying hydrological processes in hydrological modelling and climate change impact assessment.					; Xiang, Yi/KMY-3734-2024; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012; Chen, hua/AAN-1532-2020; Li, Lu/AAZ-8193-2020	Chen, Hua/0000-0002-2320-3228; Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; CHEN, Jing/0000-0002-8067-0201; 														2073-4441				NOV	2019	11	11							2417	10.3390/w11112417	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11112417													WOS:000502264500219

Co-occurrence patterns of fish species in two aquatic habitats of the Arauca River floodplain, Venezuela	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The study of co-occurrence patterns has been extensively applied to propose assembly rules for community organization. Recently, a new interest has grown in the effect of gradients on these patterns and to analyze them through new approximations such as co-occurrence networks, through which keystone species can be identified. Neotropical floodplains represent interesting systems to study such patterns, because of their spatial heterogeneity, temporal variability and their high fish species richness. With this in mind, our goal was to study the co-occurrence patterns of fish in a segment of the Arauca River's floodplain and the influence of the spatial and temporal variability on them. One stream and one floodplain lake were sampled with gill nets during 2014 - 2015 across a hydrological cycle and 5 matrices for each 5 sampled months in each water body were prepared to explore the co-occurrence patterns in each water body across months and 2 for the entire period, through a probabilistic pair-wise analysis of species co-occurrence that identified aggregated and segregated species pairs. With the observed co-occurrences x water body x month, the species weighted degrees and betweenness were calculated, and co-occurrence networks were constructed. The networks structures, in terms of the degrees of every species, were compared spatially and temporally through a generalized linear model. The stream showed the highest numbers of aggregated species pairs, and in general showed the most complex networks in terms of nodes, edges and degrees. The habitat type and the hydrological phases significantly influenced the structure of the fish co-occurrence networks. Two species, Loricariichthys brunneus and Pygocentrus cariba were identified as the core of the fish communities of the floodplain and as keystone species because they contribute to the connection of the networks by having a series of links with less frequent species.

Eutrophication in Chinese watershed is mainly due to nitrogen and phosphorus output from agricultural source. Taihu Lake is a typical eutrophic lake in China, a basin representative for the study of the temporal-spatial characteristics of pollution loading of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide scientific basis for reasonable estimation and targeted control measures of nitrogen and phosphorus loss. Based on data from nitrogen and phosphorus loss in agricultural land, livestock breeding, domestic discharge and aquaculture, this study calculated the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk for each pollution source. Using the superposition of ArcGIS raster data, we also described the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk by the formula of comprehensive loss risk. The results showed that critical risk areas of nitrogen and phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding and agricultural land during flood period in Tiaoxi watershed. Agricultural land and livestock breeding sources formed major parts of nitrogen loss, accounting for 30.85% and 36.18%, respectively, while phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding (56.28%). During non-flood period, integrated management of livestock breeding and domestic discharge requires much attention to control nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the critical risk area. Finally, it is of great practical significance to propose spatial-temporal targeted measurements to control nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in watershed for various periods and different areas.					; Yuan, Xuyin/A-6710-2019; Qin, Jing/U-1171-2019; Yuan, Xuyin/U-6655-2019	Marip, Ja Bawk/0000-0001-8790-9468; Yuan, Xuyin/0000-0001-5303-7120; 													2071-1050					AUG	2017	9	8							1493	10.3390/su9081493	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9081493													WOS:000408861800206

The depth profiles of stable Pb isotope ratios show, for the post-19th century period, the influence of several isotopically distinct anthropogenic lead sources, mainly including emissions from two Canadian smelters and from leaded gasoline combustion in Canada and in the United States. A most interesting feature of the profiles, however, is the presence of sharp stable Pb isotope ratio peaks near the depth horizon, where excess Pb-210 becomes undetectable. Using a binary mixing model and assuming that natural Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions from the catchment are given by the pre-industrial sediments at the bottom of the cores, we find that a significant part of the anthropogenic Pb supplied to the sediments at this horizon originated from smelting activities in the Upper Mississippi Valley. We assess that the Pb isotope ratio peaks, also observed in the laminated sediments of the Pettaquamscutt Estuary, Rhode Island, USA, are an accurate chronostratigraphic marker for the validation of mid-19th century Pb-210-derived dates. Given that the study lakes are located up to 2000 km from the Mississippi Valley, we conclude that this isotopic Pb signal provides a widely distributed time-marker that is key to validate Pb-210 chronologies in environmental archives from Eastern North America.

Plasticity in the diet of Astyanax taeniatus in a coastal stream from south-east Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												In this work we aimed to characterise the diet of Astyanax taeniatus (Jenyns 1842) (Characiformes, Characidae) along the Mato Grosso stream and we hypothesised that the diet of this species would vary according to spatial, seasonal and ontogenetic differences. Specimens were collected every second month at three sites with different physical attributes. The feeding habits of 651 specimens were analysed using the Alimentary Index (IA(i)). Analysis of the diet showed an effect of spatial, temporal and ontogenetic factors. Vegetal allochthonous items were more important in the diet of Astyanax taeniatus in upstream sites while animal autochthonous items were more important downstream. Ontogenetic differences in the diet were significant only in upstream sites, where adults consumed a greater amount of vegetal matter than juveniles. These results reinforce the idea that Astyanax species are opportunistic and show trophic plasticity.

The recognition that both local and regional processes act together in shaping local communities makes determining their relative roles in natural communities central to understanding patterns in community structure. 2. We investigated the relative influence of these processes on the phytoplankton communities of a highly interconnected pond system. We sampled the phytoplankton communities of 28 ponds concurrently with 20 local environmental variables. 3. We found that phytoplankton community variation, in terms of both phytoplankton community composition (PCC) and diversity, was only significantly explained by local environmental variables. These were mainly associated with the contrasting clear-water and turbid ecological states of the shallow ponds studied. Clear-water conditions favoured only a few taxa, resulting in a significantly lower taxon diversity and richness under these conditions. 4. The failure to explain variation in PCC by a dispersal model based on the water flow between ponds points at very effective species sorting. This is attributed to the high population turn-over rates and sensitivity to environmental conditions of phytoplankton communities. Some evidence was found, however, that dispersal influences local communities through mass effects between neighbouring ponds. 5. Overall, our results emphasize both the strong selection pressure that components of the food web exert on phytoplankton communities and the high potential of these communities to respond to such environmental change, thereby effectively opposing the homogenizing effects of continuous dispersal.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015	Cottenie, Karl/0000-0001-9498-8483; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843													0046-5070					NOV	2008	53	11					2170	2183		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02040.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02040.x													WOS:000262283200004

Understanding the evolution of lake water resource and its influence on economic development is important for achieving sustainable development goals. Taking Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria, as the study area, a framework was developed to investigate long-term (2000-2019) water volume variations and their influence on local economic sustainable development. First, an estimation model of water volume variations was constructed based on an optimized joint process of multi-mission altimetry data and water surface area calculations of multispectral images. Furthermore, based on nighttime light remote sensing data, three factors (namely economic level, growth, and inequality) were calculated and applied to quantify the sustainability of local economic development. Finally, the influence mechanism was explored using the Pearson correlation coefficient and grey-value relationship analysis. The results reveal significant interannual and seasonal variations in water volume of the Lake Victoria. Spatially, the western part of Lake Victoria experienced more frequent changes than the east. From the three economic perspectives, the spatiotemporal evolution of water volume variations strongly affected the economic level, whereas economic growth is influenced the least. Additionally, different effects were observed in the surrounding countries. The water volume variations had the greatest impact on Uganda's sustainable economic development from all three perspectives, with a significant lagged impact of three years on agricultural production. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic influence of water resources on sustainable economic development, offering a viable alternative to mass field surveys, especially relevant for developing and underdeveloped regions.					; Zhou, Xuefei/MSY-7262-2025; Zhang, Tinghui/NES-0358-2025; Cai, Jianqing/KFA-4476-2024; Sneeuw, Nico/N-6916-2013; Sneeuw, Nico/AAR-2050-2020	Zhang, Tinghui/0000-0002-9983-2557; Sneeuw, Nico/0000-0003-1796-0131; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				SEP	2023	123								103475	10.1016/j.jag.2023.103475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103475		SEP 2023											WOS:001077947900001

To investigate the impact of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on phytoplankton community composition, temporal variability in selective feeding by the mussels was determined from April to November 2005 in a natural lake using Delayed Fluorescence (DF) excitation spectroscopy. 2. Selective grazing by zebra mussels varied in relation to seasonal phytoplankton dynamics; mussels showed a consistent preference for cryptophytes and avoidance of chlorophytes and cyanobacteria. Diatoms, chrysophytes and dinoflagellates responded differentially to zebra mussel grazing depending on their size. Analysis of excreted products of the zebra mussels revealed that in addition to chlorophytes and cyanobacteria, phytoplankton > 50 mu m and very small phytoplankton (<= 7 mu m) were largely expelled in pseudofaeces. 3. The zebra mussel is a selective filter-feeder that alters its feeding behaviour in relation to phytoplankton composition to capture and ingest high quality phytoplankton, especially when phytoplankton occur in preferred size ranges. Flexibility of zebra mussel feeding behaviour and variation in susceptibility among phytoplankton groups to mussel ingestion indicate that invading zebra mussels could alter phytoplankton community composition of lakes and have important ecosystem consequences.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2007	52	5					823	842		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01732.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01732.x													WOS:000245987200005

Here we analyse sedimenting particulate organic matter (POMsed) during an annual cycle at two sites differing in their position relative to the major inflow and thus in their proposed contribution of allochthonous matter to the sedimentary flux, i.e., site [AL] characterised by a more allochthonous contribution und the site [AU] characterised by a more autochthonous contribution. Chemical and mineralogical composition (chlorite contents) of sedimenting matter were used for discrimination of autochthonous and allochthonous sources in addition to stable isotope signatures (delta C-13, delta N-15) of POKsed. Generally, delta C-13 values were "heavier" at site AL (-26.5 to 30.9 parts per thousand) than at site AU (-33.10 to -29.30 parts per thousand), especially during the main sedimentation period from April to September. In contrast differences between sites AL und AU in respect to delta N-15-values were small (averages: +5.10 parts per thousand and +5.80 parts per thousand, respectively). delta C-13 values were shown to be inversely correlated to contents of chlorophyll a of POMsed (i.e. lighter values with higher concentration), whereas they were positively correlated to chlorite contents and the C:N ratio of sedimenting material. The contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous POMsed changed also seasonally at both sampling sites. These differences resulted on the one hand from the seasonal succession of plankton, and on the other hand from the discharge characteristics of the inflowing rivers with regular (snow melting) and irregular maxima (flood events). A mixing model suggests that on average the allochthonous POMsed from river loads contributes at site AL 73.40% of total organic matter sedimentation and at the site AU 33.80%.

Current research focuses on resource-intensive, location-specific data collection and water quality modeling, but this approach may be cost-prohibitive for risk managers responsible for numerous recreation sites. As an alternative, we tested the ability of two data-driven models, tree regression and random forests with conditional inference trees, to select readily available hydrometeorological variables for use in linear mixed effects (LME) models predicting bacterial density. The study included the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) and Lake Michigan beaches and harbors in Chicago, Illinois, at which Escherichia coli and enterococci were measured seasonally in 2007-2009. Tree regression node variables reduced data dimensionality by > 50 %. Variable importance ranks from random forests were used in a forward-step selection based on R (2) and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE). We found two to three variables explained bacteria densities well relative to random forests with all variables. LME models with tree- or forest-selected variables performed reasonably well (0.335 < R (2) < 0.658). LME models for Lake Michigan had good prediction accuracy with respect to the single sample maximum standard (72-77 %), but limited sensitivity (23-62 %). Results suggest that our alternative approach is feasible and performs similarly to more resource-intensive approaches.					; Jones, Rachael/HTQ-3095-2023	Jones, Rachael M./0000-0003-1611-7900; Dorevitch, Samuel/0000-0002-1847-1316													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2013	185	3					2355	2366		10.1007/s10661-012-2716-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2716-8								22736208					WOS:000314033300027

Elmo			Nearshore ice complex breakup is controlled by a balance between thermal and mechanical processes	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Shore ice is an important facet of cold-climate coastal geomorphology yet is generally understudied in comparison to other aspects such as nearshore hydrodynamics. Climate change is resulting in more dynamic shore ice regimes (i.e., shortened ice season and multiple freeze-thaw cycles); thus, a clear understanding of the role of shore ice in coastal geomorphic evolution is needed. The presence of shore ice is generally thought to provide the coast a protective buffer from storm waves though some studies have indicated enhanced nearshore erosion and sediment transport associated with ice development. This is particularly apparent during the breakup phase of shore ice as sediment can be scoured from the bed, deposited in place, or transported offshore. Given this, understanding the mechanics of shore ice breakup is critical. This study documents the first combined field and laboratory evaluation of the physical conditions leading to shore ice breakup, detailing the complex interplay between thermal and mechanical processes in ice deterioration. Through a wave tank experiment as well as field observations, wave impacts alone are shown to be unlikely to cause breakup of shore ice and thermal weakening is required. This has important implications both for predicting when ice will break up as well as for identifying potential nearshore sediment transport pathways. If ice breaks up entirely from thermal degradation, then sediment is likely to be deposited in place, whereas if ice breaks up from a combination of thermal degradation and wave impact, then sediment can be redistributed across the shoreface. Monitoring of meteorological conditions during ice breakup can likely be used as a first-order predictor of geomorphic changes resulting from shore ice deterioration. This is the first combined field and laboratory study of the physical conditions leading to shorefast ice breakup. The results indicate that wave impacts alone cannot break the ice and that thermal weakening is required. The balance between physical and mechanical breakup will dictate whether ice breakup leads to beach and nearshore erosion or deposition.image						Zoet, Lucas/0000-0002-9635-4051													0197-9337	1096-9837				DEC	2023	48	15					3315	3329		10.1002/esp.5698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5698		SEP 2023											WOS:001060114200001

A total of 83 Chinook salmon were captured, which corresponded to 8.3% of the total salmonids collected in both areas. Juveniles of less than 15 cm were recorded in the upstream section of the river, from which fry-parr were less than 5 cm, and pre-smolt ranged between 5 and 10 cm aged 0+. Smolts displaying the characteristic silver coloration with an absence of parr-markings ranged between 10 and 15 cm and were aged 1+. The diet of the juvenile salmon was composed mainly of aquatic insects. Mature salmon returning from the ocean were collected in the middle section of the river, with weights ranging between 4.6 and 28 kg and their age ranged from 4+ to 6+ years in the ocean, plus 1+ year's growth in freshwater (stream type ecotype). All the adult salmon were devoid of food. Immature adults, with ages between 3+ and 4+, were collected from a small lake (Claro Solar), displayed a piscivorous diet mainly based on native Galaxid species. Adult salmon returning from the ocean were infested with the cestode Hepatoxylon trichuri, attached to the pyloric caeca.					; Bravo, Sandra/ACX-1520-2022	Ciancio, Javier/0000-0003-1674-842X; Silva Elgueta, Maria Teresa/0000-0001-6475-2525													0718-560X	0717-7178				MAR	2019	47	1					129	137		10.3856/vol47-issue1-fulltext-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.3856/vol47-issue1-fulltext-14													WOS:000461041400014

In order to reconstruct palaeoclimate fluctuations and their role in the evolution of Near Eastern societies during the mid-Holocene, high-resolution C-13 records from fossil wood remains at the archaeoloical site of Arslantepe (eastern Turkey) have been developed. MethodsAfter chemical treatment, C-13 values were measured by sample combustion flow using a FLASH EA-CHNS instrument interfaced with a Delta V isotope ratio mass spectrometer via a CONFLO III. Two replicates per sample were analysed. The measurement precision was evaluated by propagating variations of the C-13 values of samples and V-PDB standards, whereas the accuracy was checked by a quality control sample. To account for changes in atmospheric CO2, C-13 values were calculated. In addition, C-14/C-12 ratios were measured by means of an AMS system (3 MV tandem accelerator). ResultsMean C-13 curves of deciduous Quercus and Juniperus from archaeological levels between 4700 and 2000bc (Arslantepe periods VIII-VI D) were produced, where the isotope values were ordered by the available Radiocarbon ages. Interspecific variations of evergreen vs deciduous plants were postulated for the juniper C-13 values being higher than 3. The seasonal rainfall amount was recorded by the juniper remains, while the water table levels were obtained from the oak samples. ConclusionsThe local climate experienced times of enhanced/reduced precipitation in concert with regional trends. Anomalies in the air mass circulation from the Mediterranean basin also produced oscillations of rainfall amount. In such a frame the Rapid Climate Change dry events had a consistent signature in the Arslantepe C-13 record, thus potentially contributing to social or organisational changes at the site.

J	Ly, S; Sayama, T; Try, S				Ly, Steven; Sayama, Takahiro; Try, Sophal			Integrated impact assessment of climate change and hydropower operation on streamflow and inundation in the lower Mekong Basin	PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE												Water resources are key to economic development of the Mekong River Basin, but are threatened by climate change and affected by hydropower development. Knowledge of these drivers' integrated impact on future hydrological alterations is limited, especially with respect to flood inundation in the lower basin. This study assesses streamflow and flood extent alterations by reservoir operations and climate change using the latest climate projections. A distributed hydrologic model is used to generate discharge and flood extent. Our findings indicate substantial changes in seasonal and annual peak discharge due to reservoir operations. Under the future hydropower scenario, the discharge at Kratie will change by + 28% ( - 10%) during the dry (wet) season. While the effects of hydropower operations vary by season, climate change tends to increase river discharge overall. Under the high-emission scenario, the wet seasonal flow at Kratie will increase by + 7% in the near-future (2026-2050), but change by -5% under integrated impact of climate change and reservoir operations. In the far-future, the wet seasonal flow at Kratie under climate change only (integrated impact) will increase by + 33% (+ 19%). Although climate change is the dominant driver of flow alterations, hydropower development is critical for reducing discharge and flood magnitude. Nonparametric statistical testing shows significant changes in the inundated area by up to + 37% during the projected periods.					; Sayama, Takahiro/IRZ-9977-2023; Try, Sophal/HJP-8855-2023	Ly, Steven/0000-0002-0747-4415; Sayama, Takahiro/0000-0002-0558-6878													2197-4284					SEP 5	2023	10	1							55	10.1186/s40645-023-00586-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00586-8													WOS:001058281800001
J	Koper, KD; de Foy, B; Benz, H				Koper, Keith D.; de Foy, Benjamin; Benz, Harley			Composition and variation of noise recorded at the Yellowknife Seismic Array, 1991-2007	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We analyze seismic noise recorded on the 18 short-period, vertical component seismometers of the Yellowknife Seismic Array (YKA). YKA has an aperture of 23 km and is sited on cratonic lithosphere in an area with low cultural noise. These properties make it ideal for studying natural seismic noise at periods of 1 - 3 s. We calculated frequency-wave number spectra in this band for over 6,000 time windows that were extracted once per day for 17 years (1991-2007). Slowness analysis reveals a rich variety of seismic phases originating from distinct source regions: R-g waves from the Great Slave Lake; L-g waves from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans; and teleseismic P waves from the north Pacific and equatorial mid-Atlantic regions. The surface wave energy is generated along coastlines, while the body wave energy is generated at least in part in deep-water, pelagic regions. Surface waves tend to dominate at the longer periods and, just as in earthquake seismograms, Lg is the most prominent arrival. Although the periods we study are slightly shorter than the classic double-frequency microseismic band of 4 - 10 s, the noise at YKA has clear seasonal behavior that is consistent with the ocean wave climate in the Northern Hemisphere. The temporal variation of most of the noise sources can be well fit using just two Fourier components: yearly and biyearly terms that combine to give a fast rise in microseismic power from mid-June through mid-October, followed by a gradual decline. The exception is the Rg energy from the Great Slave Lake, which shows a sharp drop in noise power over a 2-week period in November as the lake freezes. The Lg noise from the east has a small but statistically significant positive slope, perhaps implying increased ocean wave activity in the North Atlantic over the last 17 years.					de Foy, Benjamin/I-8050-2019; de Foy, Benjamin/A-9902-2010	de Foy, Benjamin/0000-0003-4150-9922													2169-9313	2169-9356				OCT 17	2009	114								B10310	10.1029/2009JB006307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JB006307													WOS:000270944700001

Tissue distributions and seasonal dynamics of the hepatotoxic MC-LR and -RR in two freshwater shrimps, Palaemon modestus and Macrobrachium nipponensis were studied monthly (during June-November, 2003) in a Chinese lake containing toxic cyanobacterial blooms. The shrimps P. modestus and M. nipponensis accumulated high MCs not only in the hepatopancreas (mean 4.29 and 0.53 mu g g(-1) DW, respectively) but also in the gonad (mean 1.17 and 0.48 mu g g-1 DW, respectively), and the crayfish Procambarus clarkii accumulated as much as 0.93 mu g g(-1) DW in the gonad. This indicates that gonads of these invertebrates are the second important target organ of MCs. P. modestus apparently accumulated more MCs in their organs than M. nipponensis, which might be a reflection of their difference in trophic niche. Eggs of the shrimps accumulated 8.4% (M. nipponensis, 0.27 mu g g(-1) DW) and 29.0% (P. modestus, 2.34 mu g g(-1) DW) of total toxin burden, indicating that MCs had been transferred into offspring from their adults. Among the shrimp muscle samples analyzed, 31% were above the provisional WHO TDI level, suggesting the risk of consuming shrimps in Lake Chaohu. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) become epicenters for peat accumulation and re-aggradation of ice-rich permafrost. This re-aggradation of permafrost may be interrupted by subsequent thermokarst lake formation with sufficient disturbance. Thermokarst lakes and DTLBs are abundant near Old Crow, Yukon, Canada, but little is known about their evolution through the Holocene. In this study, we investigate the hydrology and drainage histories of seven DTLBs from the Old Crow Flats on the basis of cryostratigraphy, radiocarbon dating, and pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records. Cryostratigraphic evidence implies only one of the seven studied DTLBs underwent multiple thermokarst cycles. Radiocarbon age-depth models demonstrate a slowdown in the rate of post-drainage peat accumulation with time. Pore-ice isotope analyses reveal a spectrum of possible post-drainage isotopic histories resulting from spatial variability in permafrost, vegetation, and hydrology. Unlike lacustrine silt, post-drainage peat contains relatively constant pore-ice isotope trends. In light of our findings, we propose that syngenetic peat permafrost in DTLBs preserve a warm-season sampling of local meteoric waters. These pore-ice delta O-18 and delta H-2 records may aid millennial-scale paleoclimate investigations, as we demonstrate through our reconstruction of Holocene climate change in northern Yukon.

GIS-based maps were utilized to depict the distribution of ecotoxicological risk assessment indices to provide a visual explanation by using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) as an estimation method. Samples were collected seasonally from 12 stations selected on the Upper Sakarya River Basin, which is one of the longest fluvial ecosystems in Turkiye. As a result of applied indices, cadmium was found as the most hazardous heavy metal in terms of PERI and CF, nickel was found as the most hazardous heavy metal in terms of BRI and arsenic was found as the most hazardous heavy metal in terms of Igeo. As a result of applied PCI, 2 statistically significant factors explained 81.31% of the total variance. It was also determined that levels of almost all the investigated heavy metals (except Zn) in muscle tissues of fishes were under the permissible limits of Turkish legislation and the FAO.

The sampling was carried out in both the rainy and dry seasons at 12 locations in the Cirata Reservoir. The Mann-Whitney U-test (different test) results showed that salinity, total suspended solids (TSS), the potential of hydrogen (pH), nitrate (NO3-N), phosphate (PO4), nitrate and phosphate content in the sediment were significantly different (a < 0.05) between the rainy and dry seasons. The principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that the water quality characteristics in the Cirata Reservoir in the dry season were influenced by environmental conditions in the reservoir, especially by the floating cage aquaculture and climate conditions. The high solar radiation, low rainfall, and floating cage aquaculture increased the pH and amounts of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia (NH3-N), PO4, nitrate and phosphate in the sediment while decreasing transparency, salinity, TSS, and NH3-N. During the rainy season, the high runoff from Citarum Watershed controlled the water quality characteristics of the Cirata Reservoir. In this season, transparency, salinity, pH, DO, NH3-N, PO4, nitrate and phosphate in the sediment increased, while TSS tended to be low. In general, the water volume addition decreased the nutrition and salinity concentration in the water body. However, a distinct phenomenon occurred in the Cirata Reservoir. The runoff from agriculture, settlement, livestock, and the Citatah Karst in the Upper Citarum Watershed increased nutrition and salinity in the reservoir. Land use in the Citarum Watershed and floating cage aquaculture had an important role in the reservoir water quality.

In this paper, we used a large biooptical data set to model the remote-sensing reflectance in an extremely turbid and biologically productive Lake Taihu in China. The conceptual three-band model [R-rs(-1) (lambda(1)) - R-rs(-1)(lambda(2))] X R-rs (lambda(3)) (where R-rs represents remote-sensing reflectance just above the water surface) to retrieve Chla concentration was calibrated and validated, and a detailed assessment of its accuracy was obtained. Water samples were collected for four seasons from 2006 to 2007 at 50 sites, covering different ecosystem types, and contained three very variable optically active substances (tripton 7.9-281.7 mg . L-1, Chla 4.0-448.9 mu g . L-1, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter [a(CDOM) (440)] 0.27-2.36 m(-1)). Secchi disk transparency ranged from 8 to 85 cm. The retrieval accuracies (r(2)) of the optimal three-band model and the related band-ratio method were 0.94 and 0.92, while the root mean-square errors (RMSE) and relative errors (RE) were 15.1 mu g .

Applications of the three-band model using MERIS central bands [R-rs(-1) (681) - R-rs(-1) (709)] x R-rs(754) also allowed accurate estimation of Chla, with r(2), RMSE, and RE of 0.92, 17.0 mu g .

B	Jacobsen, D		Dudgeon, D		Jacobsen, Dean			Tropical High-Altitude Streams	TROPICAL STREAM ECOLOGY	Aquatic Ecology-San Diego											Streams in the tropics are not necessarily warm, nor do they invariably contain a high diversity of species. Mountain ranges, highland plateaus and volcanoes reach high elevations in some parts of the tropics and these areas are drained by streams as cold as their counterparts at higher latitudes. Consequently, the composition and diversity of the biota of tropical high-altitude streams differs substantially from those in the tropical lowlands and, in many ways, tropical high-altitude rhithrals, krenals, kryals and lake-outlets are similar to north-temperate alpine streams. One prominent difference between the conditions in high-altitude or alpine streams at different latitudes is the less pronounced seasonality in the tropics. Otherwise, tropical alpine streams are distinguished by their extreme altitude. Because the timber and permanent snowline lie much higher in the tropics than at latitudes further north and south tropical alpine streams extend to altitudes above 5000m asl. A particularly interesting consequence of such extreme altitude is the low availability of dissolved oxygen for stream inhabitants due to the low atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen. This chapter synthesizes the very sparse information on tropical high-altitude streams, including physico-chemical conditions, primary producers and macrophytes, fishes and, especially, macroinvertebrates. A particular aim was to describe similarities and differences in the environment, community composition and functioning of these streams compared to streams in tropical lowlands as well as those at higher latitudes. Human population density generally decreases at higher altitudes, and alpine or glacier-fed streams may be a vital source of water for rural communities as well as far-distant floodplain and urban communities. However, because of the relatively benign climate, human activities can extend to higher altitudes than is possible in temperate latitudes, and high-altitude tropical streams may be affected by a number of human impacts such as organic pollution. Anthropogenic activities, including the threat of global warming, pose a particular threat to tropical high-altitude streams because of the susceptibility of their biota to oxygen depletion, and the changes in discharge regimes due to increased rates of glacial ablation and altered rain patterns.

J	Klein, F; Goosse, H; Graham, NE; Verschuren, D				Klein, Francois; Goosse, Hugues; Graham, Nicholas E.; Verschuren, Dirk			Comparison of simulated and reconstructed variations in East African hydroclimate over the last millennium	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The multi-decadal to centennial hydroclimate changes in East Africa over the last millennium are studied by comparing the results of forced transient simulations by six general circulation models (GCMs) with published hydroclimate reconstructions from four lakes: Challa and Naivasha in equatorial East Africa, and Masoko and Malawi in southeastern inter-tropical Africa. All GCMs simulate fairly well the unimodal seasonal cycle of precipitation in the Masoko-Malawi region, while the bimodal seasonal cycle characterizing the Challa-Naivasha region is generally less well captured by most models. Model results and lake-based hydroclimate reconstructions display very different temporal patterns over the last millennium. Additionally, there is no common signal among the model time series, at least until 1850. This suggests that simulated hydroclimate fluctuations are mostly driven by internal variability rather than by common external forcing. After 1850, half of the models simulate a relatively clear response to forcing, but this response is different between the models. Overall, the link between precipitation and tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the pre-industrial portion of the last millennium is stronger and more robust for the Challa-Naivasha region than for theMasoko-Malawi region. At the inter-annual timescale, last-millennium Challa-Naivasha precipitation is positively (negatively) correlated with western (eastern) Indian Ocean SST, while the influence of the Pacific Ocean appears weak and unclear. Although most often not significant, the same pattern of correlations between East African rainfall and the Indian Ocean SST is still visible when using the last-millennium time series smoothed to highlight centennial variability, but only in fixed-forcing simulations. This means that, at the centennial timescale, the effect of (natural) climate forcing can mask the imprint of internal climate variability in large-scale teleconnections.

A composite analysis reveals that, at synoptic timescales, observed River Ammer floods are associated with enhanced moisture transport from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean towards the Ammer region, a pronounced trough over western Europe as well as enhanced potential vorticity at upper levels. We argue that this synoptic-scale configuration can trigger heavy precipitation and floods in the Ammer region. Interannual to multidecadal increases in flood frequency, as detected in the instrumental discharge record, are associated with a wave train pattern extending from the North Atlantic to western Asia, with a prominent negative center over western Europe. A similar atmospheric circulation pattern is associated with increases in flood layer frequency in the Lake Ammer sediment record during the pre-instrumental period. We argue that the complete flood layer time series from Lake Ammer sediments covering the last 5500 years contains information about atmospheric circulation variability on interannual to millennial timescales.					; Lohmann, Gerrit/M-7453-2016; Ionita, Monica/AAX-3171-2020; Rimbu, Norel/C-4799-2011	Czymzik, Markus/0000-0003-1599-7643; Lohmann, Gerrit/0000-0003-2089-733X; Rimbu, Norel/0000-0003-2832-9396; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Ionita, Monica/0000-0001-8240-4380; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2016	12	2					377	385		10.5194/cp-12-377-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-377-2016													WOS:000371625400011
J	Saigo, M; Marchese, M; Wantzen, KM				Saigo, Miguel; Marchese, Mercedes; Wantzen, Karl Matthias			A closer look at the main actors of Neotropical floodplain food webs: functional classification and niche overlap of dominant benthic invertebrates in a floodplain lake of Parana River	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												Functional classification of animals is necessary to enhance the predictive power of food web models. However, while there is a large database for functional classification of benthic invertebrates (Functional Feeding Groups, FFG) in the temperate zone, the attribution of individual species of riverine invertebrates is still in its infancies in the Neotropical Region. Different authors hypothesized that diet breadth was larger in the Tropics, however detailed analyses are scarce. In the present study we aimed at classifying dominant benthic taxa of the Middle Parana River floodplain (Argentina) into trophic guilds by diet and niche overlap analysis. We sampled twelve taxa of benthic invertebrates from a floodplain lake during low water season and performed a gut content analysis as a baseline for FFG classification. We also used available diet information of other common taxa for statistical analysis. Then, we compared the variance of niche overlap, using Pianka's index, with that of simulated null model. After that we grouped taxa using Morisita similarity index with a threshold of 0.6 and compared niche overlap with null models within and between FFGs. Observed variance of niche overlap was greater than expected by chance, confirming the presence of FFGs among analyzed taxa. Considering trophic similarity of species, we identified four FFGs: collectors, omnivores, herbivores and predators. Niche overlap was greater than expected by stochastic null models within FFGs, and smaller between FFGs. Nearly one third of analyzed taxa were classified in a different FFG than their congeners of the Holarctic region. This result indicates that classifications performed in the Holarctic region should be used with care in the Neotropical region, even in subtropical systems.

J	Wang, YY; Li, HZ; Xu, ZX				Wang, Yiyao; Li, Huaizheng; Xu, Zuxin			Rainfall-induced nutrient losses from manure-fertilized farmland in an alluvial plain	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Nutrient transport and loss in farmlands are affected by factors such as land cover, fertilization, soil type, rainfall, and management practices. We investigated the temporal and spatial changes in macronutrient transport and loss after fertilization and precipitation in manure-fertilized eggplant farmland in an alluvial plain. Upon adding topical fertilizer, concentrations of most nutrients in runoff and groundwater increased, and nitrogen runoff increased from 22.11 to 35.81 kg/ha, although eggplant yield did not increase correspondingly. Incorporation of fertilizer by plowing reduced nutrient losses (nitrogen runoff/fertilizer decreased from 18.40 to 12.29 %). Measurements taken along the nutrient transport route (runoff, drainage ditch, groundwater, river water, and finally rainfall) revealed that concentrations of most nutrients declined at each stage. Nutrient characteristics varied by transport, and the forms of nitrogen and phosphorus differed greatly between runoff and groundwater (nitrate/nitrogen in runoff was similar to 43.49 %, while in groundwater similar to 5.41 %). Most nutrient concentrations in runoff decreased greatly during the planting season (total nitrogen decreased from 62.25 to 4.17 mg/L), correlated positively with temperature and stage of plant growth, but little temporal change was observed in groundwater. This field investigation during one planting season exemplifies the basic principles of nutrient loss and transport from manure-fertilized farmland in an alluvial plain.

Snow samples representing the whole snowpack accumulated at the end of the cold season were collected in all cases. The snow specific surface area (SSA) of these samples, 140-260 cm(2) g(-1), was characteristic of aged snow with low retention capacity. PAHs were the pollutant group in highest concentrations (500-8,400 pg L-1). PCBs and PBDEs were found in concentrations of 460-900 and 8.5-290 pg L-1, respectively. From the fourteen investigated BDE congeners, only BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100 and BDE-209 were found above the detection limit, which is consistent with the results found in the only previous study in the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) which also involved a steep gradient (1,683-2,634 m asl; maximum planar distance 5 km; Arellano et al. 2011) and confirm the capacity of these low-volatile compounds for long-range transport from distant sources. HCB was found in a concentration range of 34-55 pg L-1. Snow deposition fluxes of PCB-118, PCB-153, gamma-HCH, alpha-endosulfan and BDE-47 showed statistically significant correlations with altitude, involving higher values at higher elevation. This trend may reflect cold trapping effects in view of the snow particle contents and SSA values. However, these gradients were only significant for this limited number of compounds within each pollutant group which may be explained by differences in physical-chemical properties of the compounds and the limited capacity of the aged snow for organic pollutant retention. In some other cases, for example benzo[a]pyrene, the observed vertical gradients may reflect higher preservations at lower temperatures.

A temperate former West Antarctic ice sheet suggested by an extensive zone of subglacial meltwater channels	GEOLOGY												Several recent studies predict that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will become increasingly unstable under warmer conditions. Insights on such change can be assisted through investigations of the subglacial landscape, which contains imprints of former ice-sheet behavior. Here, we present radio-echo sounding data and satellite imagery revealing a series of ancient large sub-parallel subglacial bed channels preserved in the region between the Moller and Foundation Ice Streams, West Antarctica. We suggest that these newly recognized channels were formed by significant meltwater routed along the ice-sheet bed. The volume of water required is likely substantial and can most easily be explained by water generated at the ice surface. The Greenland Ice Sheet today exemplifies how significant seasonal surface melt can be transferred to the bed via englacial routing. For West Antarctica, the Pliocene (2.6-5.3 Ma) represents the most recent sustained period when temperatures could have been high enough to generate surface melt comparable to that of present-day Greenland. We propose, therefore, that a temperate ice sheet covered this location during Pliocene warm periods.					; Bingham, Robert G/G-3576-2017; Bingham, Robert/G-3576-2017; Siegert, Martin/A-3826-2008; Rippin, David Manish/AAW-5063-2021; Corr, Hugh/C-5398-2011	Ferraccioli, Fausto/0000-0002-9347-4736; Bingham, Robert G/0000-0002-0630-2021; Siegert, Martin/0000-0002-0090-4806; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				NOV	2014	42	11					971	974		10.1130/G35980.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G35980.1													WOS:000345440300011
J	Weitz, J; Demlie, M				Weitz, Jannie; Demlie, Molla			Conceptual modelling of groundwater-surface water interactions in the Lake Sibayi Catchment, Eastern South Africa	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Lake Sibayi, a topographically closed fresh water lake in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and coastal groundwater aquifers surrounding the lake, are important water resources and are used extensively for domestic water supplies. Both the lake and groundwater support important and ecologically sensitive wetland system in the area. Surface and subsurface geological information, groundwater head, hydrochemical and environmental isotope data were analysed to develop a conceptual model of aquifer-lake interaction, upon which a three dimensional numerical model will be based. Local geologic, groundwater head distribution, lake level, hydrochemical and environmental isotope data confirm direct hydraulic link between groundwater and the lake. In the western section of the catchment, groundwater flows to the lake where groundwater head is above lake stage, whereas along the eastern section, the presence of mixing between lake and groundwater isotopic compositions indicates that the lake recharges the aquifer. Stable isotope signals further revealed the movement of lake water through and below the coastal dune cordon before eventually discharging into the Indian Ocean. Quantification of the 15 year monthly water balance for the lake shows strong seasonal variations of the water balance components and average residence time of water in the lake is about 7.5 years. Recent increase in rate of water abstraction from the lake combined with decreasing precipitation and rapidly increasing pine plantations appears to be responsible for lake level reduction which would have dramatic negative effects on the neighbouring ecosystem and a potential seawater invasion of the coastal aquifer.

Water quality monitoring and assessment of an urban Mediterranean lake facilitated by remote sensing applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Degradation of water quality is a major problem worldwide and often leads to serious environmental impacts and concerns about public health. In this study, the water quality monitoring and assessment of the Koumoundourou Lake, a brackish urban shallow lake located in the northeastern part of Elefsis Bay (Greece), were evaluated. A number of water quality parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, electrical conductivity, turbidity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a concentration) were analyzed in water samples collected bimonthly over a 1-year period from five stations throughout the lake. Moreover, biological quality elements were analysed seasonally over the 1-year period (benthic fauna). Statistical analysis was performed in order to evaluate the water quality of the lake and distinguish sources of variation measured in the samples. Furthermore, the chemical and trophic status of the lake was evaluated according to the most widely applicable classification schemes. Satellite images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper were used in order for algorithms to be developed and calculate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The trophic status of the lake was characterized as oligotrophic based on phosphorus and as mesotrophic-eutrophic based on Chl-a concentrations. The results of the remote sensing application indicated a relatively high coefficient of determination (R (2)) among point sampling results and the remotely sensed data, which implies that the selected algorithm is reliable and could be used for the monitoring of Chl-a concentration in the particular water body when no field data are available.

They harvest light at extremely low intensities and use various inorganic electron donors to fix carbon dioxide into biomass. Until now, most information on the functional ecology and local adaptations of Chlorobia members came from isolates and merely 26 sequenced genomes that may not adequately represent natural populations. To address these limitations, we analyzed global metagenomes to profile planktonic Chlorobia cells from the oxyclines of 42 freshwater bodies, spanning subarctic to tropical regions and encompassing all four seasons. We assembled and compiled over 500 genomes, including metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), single amplified genomes (SAGs), and reference genomes from cultures, clustering them into 71 metagenomic operational taxonomic units (mOTUs or "species"). Of the 71 mOTUs, 57 were classified within the genus Chlorobium, and these mOTUs represented up to ;60% of the microbial communities in the sampled anoxic waters. Several Chlorobium-associated mOTUs were globally distributed, whereas others were endemic to individual lakes. Although most clades encoded the ability to oxidize hydrogen, many lacked genes for the oxidation of specific sulfur and iron substrates. Surprisingly, one globally distributed Scandinavian clade encoded the ability to oxidize hydrogen, sulfur, and iron, suggesting that metabolic versatility facilitated such widespread colonization. Overall, these findings provide new insight into the biogeography of the Chlorobia and the metabolic traits that facilitate niche specialization within lake ecosystems. IMPORTANCE The reconstruction of genomes from metagenomes has helped explore the ecology and evolution of environmental microbiota. We applied this approach to 274 metagenomes collected from diverse freshwater habitats that spanned oxic and anoxic zones, sampling seasons, and latitudes. We demonstrate widespread and abundant distributions of planktonic Chlorobia-associated bacteria in hypolimnetic waters of stratified freshwater ecosystems and show they vary in their capacities to use different electron donors. Having photoautotrophic potential, these Chlorobia members could serve as carbon sources that support metalimnetic and hypolimnetic food webs.					; Greening, Chris/J-4408-2019; Mehrshad, Maliheh/O-6815-2017; Garcia, Sarahi/H-4365-2014; Tsuji, Jackson/AAV-4748-2021; Garcia, Sarahi L./H-4365-2014; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	Mehrshad, Maliheh/0000-0002-1108-6888; McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Peura, Sari/0000-0003-3892-8157; Tsuji, Jackson M./0000-0001-7244-4709; Greening, Chris/0000-0001-7616-0594; Garcia, Sarahi L./0000-0002-8622-0308; 													2379-5077					JUN	2021	6	3							e01196-20	10.1128/mSystems.01196-20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01196-20								33975970					WOS:000709811800011

However, integrating data into increasingly complex numerical models remain challenging. Here we infer two-dimensional subglacial channel networks and hydraulic parameters for Gorner Glacier, Switzerland, based on available field data at five specific times (snapshots) across the melt season of 2005. The field dataset is one of the most complete available, including borehole water pressure, tracer experiments and meteorological variables. Yet, these observations are still too sparse to fully characterize the drainage system and thus, a unique solution is neither expected nor desirable. We use a geostatistical generator and a steady-state water flow model to produce a set of subglacial channel networks that are consistent with measured water pressure and tracer-transit times. Field data are used to infer hydraulic and morphological parameters of the channels under the assumption that the location of channels persists during the melt season. Results indicate that it is possible to identify locations where subglacial channels are more likely. In addition, we show that different network structures can equally satisfy the field data, which support the use of a stochastic approach to infer unobserved subglacial features.

Hot and sick? Impacts of warming and a parasite on the dominant zooplankter of Lake Baikal	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate warming impacts ecosystems through multiple interacting pathways, including via direct thermal responses of individual taxa and the combined responses of closely interacting species. In this study, we examined how warming and infection by an oomycete parasite (Saprolegnia) affect the dominant zooplankter of Russia's Lake Baikal, the endemic copepodEpischurella baikalensis. We used a combination of laboratory experiments, long-term monitoring data, and population modeling. Experiments showed a large difference in the thermal optima of host and parasite, with strong negative effects of warm temperatures onE. baikalensissurvival and reproduction and a negative effect ofSaprolegniainfection on survival.Saprolegniainfection had an unexpected positive effect onE. baikalensisreproductive output, which may be consistent with fecundity compensation by females exposed to the parasite. Long-term monitoring data suggested thatSaprolegniainfections were most common during the warmest periods of the year. Population models, parameterized with experimental and literature data, correctly predicted the timing ofSaprolegniaepizootics, but overestimated the negative effect of warming onE. baikalensispopulations. Models suggest that diel vertical migration may allowE. baikalensisto escape the negative effects of increasing temperatures and parasitism and enableE. baikalensisto persist in the face of moderate warming of Lake Baikal. Our results contribute to understanding of how warming and parasitism interact to affect the pelagic ecosystems of cold lakes and oceans and how the consequences of these interacting stressors can vary seasonally, spatially, and interannually.					; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011; Nakov, Teofil/I-3707-2017; Timofeyev, Maxim/F-2071-2010	Nakov, Teofil/0009-0000-9589-5748; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220; Woo, Kara/0000-0002-5125-4188; Shchapov, Kirill/0000-0001-6823-0927; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Timofeyev, Maxim/0000-0002-5250-6818													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2020	65	11					2772	2786	11550	10.1002/lno.11550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11550		JUL 2020											WOS:000550471600001

Possessing a spectrum of magnesium, sodium, sulfate, carbonate, and chloride salts, these low-temperature high-salinity lakes are analogs for planetary ice-brine environments, including the ice shells of Europa and Enceladus and ice-brine systems on Mars. As such, understanding the thermodynamics and biogeochemistry of these systems can provide insights into the evolution, habitability, and detectability of high-priority astrobiology targets. We show that biomass is typically concentrated in a layer near the base of the ice cover, but that chemical and biological impurities are present throughout the ice. Coupling bioburden, ionic concentration, and seasonal temperature measurements, we demonstrate that impurity entrainment in the ice is directly correlated to ice formation rate and parent fluid composition. We highlight unique phenomena, including brine supercooling, salt hydrate precipitation, and internal brine layers in the ice cover, important processes to be considered for planetary ice-brine environments. These systems can be leveraged to constrain the distribution, longevity, and habitability of low-temperature solar system brines-relevant to interpreting spacecraft data and planning future missions in the lens of both planetary exploration and planetary protection.					; Glass, Jennifer/H-5363-2018	Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-8811-6280; Buffo, Jacob/0000-0002-3234-3417; Schmidt, Britney Elyce/0000-0001-7376-8510; Pontefract, Alexandra/0009-0009-1510-2425; Klempay, Benjamin/0000-0003-3531-829X; Lawrence, Justin/0000-0001-7520-5914													1531-1074	1557-8070				AUG 1	2022	22	8					962	980		10.1089/ast.2021.0078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2021.0078		JUN 2022						35671513					WOS:000808480500001

Continuous recruitment underpins fish persistence in the arid rivers of far-western Queensland, Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Fish living in highly variable and unpredictable environments need to possess life-history strategies that enable them to survive environmental extremes such as floods and drought. We used the length-frequency distributions of multiple fish species in multiple seasons and highly variable hydrological conditions to infer antecedent breeding behaviour in rivers of far-western Queensland, Australia. Hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) recruitment of some or all species of fish would occur within waterholes during no-flow periods; (2) there would be seasonal recruitment responses in some fish species; (3) recruitment of some species would be enhanced by channel flows and/or flooding. Hydrology and the incidence of flooding were highly variable across the study area during 2006-2008. Flood-influenced recruitment was evident for Hyrtl's tandan, Barcoo grunter and Welch's grunter. Silver tandan, golden goby, Cooper Creek catfish and Australian smelt showed evidence of seasonal recruitment unrelated to antecedent hydrology. However, most species demonstrated continual recruitment in isolated waterholes, irrespective of antecedent flow conditions and season. Continual and seasonal recruitment capabilities have obvious advantages over flood-pulse recruitment in rivers with highly unpredictable flood regimes and underpin the persistence of many fish species in arid and semiarid rivers.

J	Zhang, LL; Liu, JL; Li, Y; Zhao, YW				Zhang, Lulu; Liu, Jingling; Li, Yi; Zhao, Yanwei			Applying AQUATOX in determining the ecological risk assessment of polychlorinated biphenyl contamination in Baiyangdian Lake, North China	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There is a growing interest in the application of ecological models to improve the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of toxicants. For this study, the AQUATOX model was implemented using 18 pelagic and benthic populations derived from field data obtained at Baiyangdian Lake between April 2009 and March 2010. The model was evaluated to examine its utility in assessing the ecological risk of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in aquatic ecosystems. Model parameters were calibrated to simulate the complex seasonal patterns of Baiyangdian Lake biomass populations. Sensitivity analysis revealed the potential importance of indirect effects and demonstrated the vital role of parameter values in determining the biomass of each trophic level. The model was highly sensitive to parameters related to temperature limitations and respiration rates. Moreover, it was effective in estimating risks associated with the direct toxic PCB effects of each population and the indirect ecological effects distributed through the coupled pelagic-benthic food web. Benchmarks derived from AQUATOX-Baiyangdian were approximately one order of magnitude less than the benchmarks derived from NOEC in a report by the United States of America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Comparison analysis determined the model could provide a good basis in ascertaining ecological protection levels of "chemicals of concern" for aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, AQUATOX can potentially be used to provide necessary information corresponding to early warning and rapid forecasting of pollutant transport and fate in the management of chemicals that put aquatic ecosystems at risk.

It is thus essential to elucidate the effects of climate change and human disturbances on the dynamics of different forests. Here we selected the forest of Yunnan pine (YNP) (Pinus yunnanensis), an endemic tree species in Southwest China as an instance, to examine its dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in central Yunnan where it predominantly occurs, using fossil Pinus pollen percentages and its estimated plant abundances in four lake catchments, central Yunnan. Our study reveals that the dynamics of YNP forests (YNPFs) were principally associated with climatic conditions at 20,000-2500 cal. a BP, whereas the dynamics of YNPFs after 2500 cal. a BP were significantly affected by human activities such as agriculture as well as the extraction and processing of mineral resources in central Yunnan. A long-term and big deforestation occurred at 2500-800 cal. a BP, which was caused by human activities. The restoration of YNPFs in central Yunnan after 800 cal. a BP was predominantly attributed to the natural succession of the secondary vegetation, and reforestation with the aid of ecological protection policies at the end of the 20th century has made its contribution to the recovery of YNPFs in recent decades. Climatic conditions driven by monsoon intensity and seasonal insolation as well as human activities are major factors controlling the dynamics of YNPFs in central Yunnan. Especially, the impact of human activities on YNPFs became more pronounced over the past 2500 years. Our findings not only provide a reference for understanding the interrelationships among forests, ecological environments, climate change, and human activities in central Yunnan, but also offer scientific data for making sustainable forest management policies and ecological conservation strategies.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				MAY	2025	336								105311	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2025.105311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2025.105311		MAR 2025											WOS:001441217600001

In the study, we investigated spatio-temporal variations of S. japonicum infection risk in Anhui Province and assessed the associations of the disease with key environmental factors with the aim of understanding the mechanism of the disease and seeking clues to effective and sustainable schistosomiasis control. Methodology/Principal Findings Infection data of schistosomiasis from annual conventional surveys were obtained at the village level in Anhui Province, China, from 2000 to 2010 and used in combination with environmental data. The spatio-temporal kriging model was used to assess how these environmental factors affected the spatio-temporal pattern of schistosomiasis risk. Our results suggested that seasonal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), seasonal variation of land surface temperature at daytime (LSTD), and distance to the Yangtze River were negatively significantly associated with risk of schistosomiasis. Predictive maps showed that schistosomiasis prevalence remained at a low level and schistosomiasis risk mainly evolved along the Yangtze River. Schistosomiasis risk also followed a focal spatial pattern, fluctuating temporally with a peak (the largest spatial extent) in 2005 and then contracting gradually but with a scattered distribution until 2010. Conclusion The fitted spatio-temporal kriging model can capture variations of schistosomiasis risk over space and time. Combined with techniques of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this approach facilitates and enriches risk modeling of schistosomiasis, which in turn helps to identify prior areas for effective and sustainable control of schistosomiasis in Anhui Province and perhaps elsewhere in China.

We conducted a four-rotation field measurement with discrepant N fertilizer rates during the wheat season of the rice-wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake region in China to test the hypothesis. Across all years, a nonlinear model well characterized the response of cumulative NO emissions to N fertilizer rates. The direct emission factors of NO induced by fertilizer also increased nonlinearly with increasing N doses, with a mean of 1.06% (ranging from 0.54% to 1.49%). NO emissions were low (<1.81 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) over the 0-180 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer additions; above these additions, the increasing N rates resulted in substantial NO increases ranging from 73% to 245% but only elevated crop yields by 6%. The results suggested defining the N rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) as a promising level for achieving decreased NO emissions without greatly affecting the economic return from grain yield.

Mixing and its effects on biogeochemistry in the persistently stratified, deep, tropical Lake Matano, Indonesia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In the > 590-m deep, tropical Lake Matano (Indonesia), stratification is characterized by weak thermal gradients (< 2 degrees C per 500 m) and weak salinity gradients (< 0.14 parts per thousand per 500 m). These gradients persist over seasons, decades, and possibly centuries. Under these nearly steady-state conditions, vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (K-z) cannot be estimated by conventional methods that rely on time derivatives of temperature distributions. We use and compare several alternative methods: one-dimensional k-epsilon modeling, three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, correlation with the size of Thorpe instabilities, and correlation with the stability frequency. In the thermocline region, at 100-m depth, the K-z is similar to 5 x 10(-6) m(2) s(-1), but, below 300 m, the small density gradient results in large (20 m) vertical eddies and high mixing rates (K-z similar to 10(-2) m(2) s(-1)). The estimated timescale of water renewal in the monimolimnion is several hundred years. Intense evaporation depletes the surface mixed layer of O-16 and H-1 isotopes, making it isotopically heavier. The lake waters become progressively isotopically lighter with depth, and the isotopic composition in the deep waters is close to those of the ground and tributary waters. The vertical distribution of K-z is used in a biogeochemical reaction-transport model. We show that, outside of a narrow thermocline region, the vertical distributions of dissolved oxygen, iron, methane, and phosphorus are shaped by vertical variations in transport rates, rather than by sources or sinks.					; Fowle, David/B-1074-2008	Mucci, Alfonso/0000-0001-9155-6319; Fowle, David/0000-0001-7765-9047; Nomosatryo, Sulung/0000-0002-3233-1440													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2010	55	2					763	776		10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0763	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.55.2.0763													WOS:000276440000026

Many spawning sites of migration fishes are lost, and their growth and reproduction are affected. The Yangtze River with connected lakes is the most important fresh water fishery area in China. The Yangtze's four major carp species (YFMCS) are the most typical migration fish lived in this area. They reproduce in river and grow in lake. Distributaries lies between the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake are the passages for these migration fishes. Due to the construction of dams and barriers, some original passages were out of use. Up to now, only four channels exist between the river and lake, there are Songcikou, Taipingkou and Ouchikou normally called "three outlets", and Chenglingji inlet. Diverted Water Volume (DWV) and the Percentage of Diverted Water (PDW) through the three outlets reflect the relationship between the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake. The variation of river-lake relation caused by dam construction, and the effect on migration fishes are discussed in this paper. The relationship of DWV and fry output in middle reach of the Yangtze river and the Dongting Lake, PDW and the percentage of the YFMCS in a total catch of fish, DWV and flux of carp fry at the Jianli station, DWV and yield of the YFMCS were analyzed. The results show that dams and barriers constructed on the Yangtze River threaten some fish species in this area, especially the migration fishes. The connectivity degree of river and lake decide the growth and reproduction of emigration fishes, the yield of the YFMCS increase by the DWV increase, and hydraulic project have important influence on reproduction of fishes. In order to reduce the ecological influence of hydropower projects, reservoir management especially in spawning season should integrate ecological demand. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hg accumulation in fish tissues poses a risk to the local population since fish is one of the main sources of protein in the region. The aim of this study was to evaluate Hg distribution in demersal and pelagic carnivorous fish between seasons in Puruzinho Lake in the Brazilian Amazon. Total Hg was quantified in 221 individuals of 8 species obtained during the high water and low water seasons. Two-way ANOVA indicated an interaction between foraging habitat and season. During high water, total Hg concentrations were similar between demersal and pelagic fish, while in low water, total Hg levels were higher in demersal fish. Pelagic and demersal fishes' Hg levels were similar between the two seasons.

However, drivers of bloom formation and the contribution of emerging resting eggs are largely unexplored. We investigated the dynamics and the triggers of rotifer blooms in African soda-lakes and assessed their impact on other trophic levels. A metaanalysis of rotifer peak densities including abundances of up to 6 X 10(5) individuals L-1 demonstrated that rotifer bloom formation was uncoupled from the food environment and the seasonality of climatic conditions. A time series with weekly sampling intervals from Lake Nakuru (Kenya) revealed that intrinsic growth factors (food quality and the physicochemical environment) significantly affected rotifer population fluctuations, but were of minor importance for bloom formation. Instead, rotifer bloom formation was linked to sediment resuspension, a prerequisite for hatching of resting-eggs. Population growth rates exceed pelagic birth rates and simulations of rotifer dynamics confirmed the quantitative importance of rotifer emergence from the sediment egg-bank and signifying a decoupling of bloom formation from pelagic reproduction. Rotifer blooms led to a top-down control of small-sized algae and facilitated a switch to more grazingresistant, filamentous cyanobacteria. This shift in phytoplankton composition cascaded up the food chain and triggered the return of filter-feeding flamingos. Calculations of consequent changes in the lake's energy budget and export of aquatic primary production to terrestrial ecosystems demonstrated the large potential impact of nonseasonal disturbances on the functioning of shallow tropical lakes.

Abiotic properties of lakes (location, morphometry, water chemistry and temperature) shape the phytoplankton community structure. We studied how this may be manifested in the FA composition of the common freshwater calanoid copepod Eudiaptomus spp. The proportions of saturated and polyunsaturated FA in Eudiaptomus, sampled from 25 lakes in boreal and subarctic regions, showed large variation (ca. 20-60 and 30-70%, respectively), while the proportion of monounsaturated FA was less variable (5-15%). The FA composition of Eudiaptomus differed significantly between subarctic and boreal lakes. Eudiaptomus from subarctic lakes had a higher proportion of 22:6 omega 3 and lower proportions of 18:2 omega 6, 18:3 omega 3 and 20:5 omega 3 than Eudiaptomus from boreal lakes. In the boreal lakes, the omega 3:omega 6 ratio in Eudiaptomus increased with increasing nutrients, chl a and dissolved organic carbon, presumably due to parallel changes in phytoplankton community composition, but only in the large and clearwater lakes, and not in the small and humic ones. Copepods are seasonally important prey for planktivorous fish, and the observed among-lake differences in the proportions of essential FA may influence fish growth and reproduction.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Hiltunen, Minna/0000-0002-0003-3000; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	2016	38	3					468	477		10.1093/plankt/fbw008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbw008													WOS:000377299000007

These physical impacts will in turn have economic consequences through effects on riparian development, river and reservoir recreation, water treatment, harmful aquatic blooms, and a range of other sectors. In this paper, we analyze the physical and economic effects of changes in freshwater quality across the contiguous U.S. in futures with and without global-scale greenhouse gas mitigation. Using a water allocation and quality model of 2119 river basins, we estimate the impacts of various projected emissions outcomes on several key water quality indicators, and monetize these impacts with a water quality index approach. Under mitigation, we find that water temperatures decrease considerably and that dissolved oxygen levels rise in response. We find that the annual economic impacts on water quality of a high emissions scenario rise from $1.4 billion in 2050 to $4 billion in 2100, leading to present value mitigation benefits, discounted at 3%, of approximately $17.5 billion over the 2015-2100 period.					; Chapra, Steven/A-5752-2008	/0000-0001-9494-785X; Boehlert, Brent/0000-0003-2540-4143; 														1942-2466				SEP	2015	7	3					1326	1338		10.1002/2014MS000400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014MS000400													WOS:000363278200019

Differences in rheotactic responses contribute to divergent habitat use between parapatric lake and stream threespine stickleback	EVOLUTION												Migration among populations is widely thought to undermine adaptive divergence, assuming gene flow arises from random movement of individuals. If individuals instead differ in dispersal behavior, phenotype-dependent dispersal can reduce the effective rate of gene flow or even facilitate divergence. For example, parapatric populations of lake and stream stickleback tend to actively avoid dispersing into the adjoining habitat. However, the behavioral basis of this nonrandom dispersal was previously unknown. Here, we show that lake and stream stickleback exhibit divergent rheotactic responses (behavioral response to currents). During the breeding season, wild-caught inlet stream stickleback were better than lake fish at maintaining position in currents, faced upstream more, and spent more time in low-current areas. As a result, stream fish expended significantly less energy in currents than did lake fish. These divergent rheotactic responses likely contribute to divergent habitat use by lake and stream stickleback. Although rheotactic differences were absent in nonbreeding fish, divergent behavior of breeding-season fish may suffice for assortative mating by breeding location. The resulting reproductive isolation between lake and stream fish may explain the fine-scale evolutionary differentiation in parapatric stickleback populations.

J	Shimoda, Y; Arhonditsis, GB				Shimoda, Yuko; Arhonditsis, George B.			Integrating hierarchical Bayes with phosphorus loading modelling	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The causal linkage between lake productivity and phosphorus loading has provided the basis for a family of models that predict lake total phosphorus concentrations as a function of lake morphometric/hydraulic characteristics, such as the areal phosphorus loading rate, mean lake depth, fractional phosphorus retention and areal hydraulic loading. Most of these empirical models have been derived from "cross-sectional" datasets, comprising multiple point measurements or single averages from a number of lakes, and are typically used to predict changes within a single system at different points in time. This practice implicitly postulates that the large scale (cross-sectional) patterns described in the model are also representative of the dynamics of individual systems. In this study, we relax this assumption using a Bayesian hierarchical strategy that aims to accommodate the role of significant sources of variability (morphology, hydraulic regime). We first examine several hierarchical structures representing different characterizations of model error, parameter covariance, and prior distribution followed by the hyperparameters. Our analysis primarily highlights the robustness of the posterior group-level patterns to the hierarchical formulation developed. We also show that the delineation of homogeneous subsets of lakes with respect to their morphological/hydraulic characteristics and the subsequent integration with hierarchical frameworks may give empirical phosphorus retention/loading models with better predictive ability. We then present a complementary exercise that aims to accommodate the spatial and seasonal total phosphorus variability within individual systems, using a spatially-explicit simple mass-balance model forced with idealized sinusoidal loading. Our study concludes by advocating that the hierarchical Bayes provides a conceptually appealing framework to gradually accommodate different sources of variability and more prudently increase the complexity of simple empirical models.

J	Anda, A; Teixeira Da Silva, JA; Soos, G				Anda, Angela; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.; Soos, Gabor			Evapotranspiration and crop coefficient of common reed at the surroundings of Lake Balaton, Hungary	AQUATIC BOTANY												This study analysed the variation in the crop coefficient (K-c)of local common reed (Phragmites australis) stands based on evapotranspiration (ET) and local reference (Penman Monteith) ET measurements at the surroundings of Lake Balaton, Hungary. ET was measured daily over several seasons with modified Thornthwaite-Matter evapotranspirometers with compensative irrigation using free-flowing above-ground water. This modified irrigation regime enabled the long-term cultivation of common reed. The average annual water loss of common reed of six seasons between 2005 and 2011 ranged from 566 to 1008 mm but depended on the weather, especially on net radiation. The average ET of common reed was 779 mm for the entire study period while the average K-c, value was 1.23. Seasonal mean K-c, values for common reed ranged from 0.73 to 1.37. In cool weather (seasonal mean air temperatures <17 degrees C), annual mean K-c, and ET were 0.73 and 385 mm, respectively while in hot weather (seasonal mean temperatures above 18 degrees C), K-c and ET were 1.37 and 875.4 mm, respectively. Multiple regression analysis and Akaike Information Criterion were used to determine the relationship between ET and different meteorological variables, and indicated that the leading factors were the air temperatures and net radiation on ET during the study. In the common reed community, the driving force on ET was the available energy. These observations, which cover a six-year period, may be more valid and reliable than other measurements made in the literature thus far, all of which reported a shorter observation period.

Anthropogenic and habitat correlates of hybridization between hatchery and wild brook trout	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Human activities are breaking down barriers to interpopulation hybridization with results that range from populations that resist introgression to populations at serious risk of genetic extinction, particularly between wild and hatchery fish because of the routine stocking of lakes and streams containing wild populations. We investigated whether specific human actions and (or) habitat characteristics were associated with the extent of hybridization between hatchery and wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) occupying lakes in Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Hatchery and wild trout tended to hybridize more in lakes (i) supporting smaller populations (i. e., having lower pH and situated at higher elevations), (ii) stocked earlier in the season, and (iii) with greater exposure to other human activities (fishing). Our results highlight how particular human activities may interact with specific habitat conditions to elicit hybridization in wild populations. Hence, the use of readily available habitat and land use data may provide an economical means of anticipating hybridization or identifying indigenous populations with minimal introgression.

J	Larsson, P; Lampert, W				Larsson, Petter; Lampert, Winfried			Experimental evidence of a low-oxygen refuge for large zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested the hypothesis that hypoxic zones in the metalimnion and hypolimnion of lakes can provide a refuge against fish predation for large zooplankton. Experiments were run in a large indoor mesocosm system (Plon Plankton Towers). We compared mortality rates of Daphnia pulicaria due to free-ranging fish in mesocosms with either oxic or hypoxic hypolimnia. In the presence of fish Daphnia moved down below the thermocline. Under hypoxic conditions their distribution peaked in the upper hypolimnion at a concentration of approximately 1 mg O(2) L(-1). In oxygen-saturated hypolimnia Daphnia were distributed evenly. The mortality rate of Daphnia in the hypoxic treatment was only one third of that in the oxic treatment. The hypoxic habitat provided a refuge, as Daphnia tolerated lower oxygen concentrations than did fish. However, there may be demographic costs associated with living in low-oxygen conditions. Hence, the importance of a hypoxic refuge under natural conditions will most likely depend on the trade-off between predation risk and cost of living in hypoxic waters.																			0024-3590					SEP	2011	56	5					1682	1688		10.4319/lo.2011.56.5.1682	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.5.1682													WOS:000294603500010

Gordon			Relative Importance of Water Temperature, Water Level, and Lunar Cycle to Migratory Activity in Spawning-Phase Sea Lampreys in Lake Ontario	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We analyzed historical trapping records from six Lake Ontario tributaries to (1) compare the relative importance of water temperature, water level, and lunar cycle to migratory activity in upstream-migrating sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus and (2) determine whether the relative importance of these variables differs among streams. We found significant stream-dependent differences in the relative importance of the environmental variables. Water temperature was the best predictor of migratory activity in all six streams. The seasonal distribution of migratory activity was related to mean stream temperature, with an estimated peak migration temperature of approximately 15 degrees C. Changes in stream temperature were equally as important. Migratory activity was stimulated when mean stream temperature increased between consecutive days and was suppressed when mean stream temperature decreased between consecutive days. Water level was a reliable predictor of migratory activity only in the two smallest streams. We hypothesize that high water levels may increase migratory activity in small streams by making them more noticeable. There was no evidence to support either a circumlunar rhythm or gravitational influence on migratory activity. However, because we did not account for cloud cover or the presence of artificial light sources, we cannot exclude the possibility that nighttime light levels influence migratory activity. Our findings provide a set of rules for coarsely projecting migratory activity in upstream-migrating sea lampreys.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2010	139	3					700	712		10.1577/T09-042.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-042.1													WOS:000277639200007

Here, we report a newly discovered microlithic site at Daiqu (DQ) in the Tongtian River basin of the central-eastern plateau. We collected 239 lithic artifacts from the DQ site for typological analysis. OSL and AMS14C dating samples were collected from the human active layer. Lipid residues from hearth sediments were analyzed, and we simulated and assessed environmental extremity and route accessibility for the site. Dating results suggest that the stable sedimentary layers began to form around 10.96 & PLUSMN; 0.56 ka BP at the DQ site. Human activity at DQ as early as 9271 & PLUSMN; 143 cal a BP, making it the earliest reported Holocene site with accurate stratigraphic dating on the plateau hinterland to date. Hearths and lithic artifacts indicate that the DQ site was a frequently used seasonal hunting camp, where quality lithic raw material was obtained and microliths processed. Prehistoric humans occupying the site relied on non-ruminant terrestrial animals as food resources. The DQ site is ideally situated to serve as a transit station for hunter-gatherers as they migrated between high and low elevations. Ameliorating Holocene climate promoted prehistoric human exploration of more environmentally extreme areas.

Great Canadian Lagerstatten 1. Early Eocene Lagerstatten of the Okanagan Highlands (British Columbia and Washington State)	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												The Early Eocene Okanagan Highlands series of lacustrine shale and coal deposits, in far western North America, constitutes a significant group of fossil sites with exceptional preservation of a diverse suite of organisms (Lagerstatten). With contemporaneous basins arrayed across about 1000 kilometres of southern British Columbia and northern Washington, these sites offer a unique opportunity to examine the paleoecology of terrestrial communities spanning a temperate, low-seasonality landscape in a montane setting during a time of generally warm temperatures across the globe.

Prediction of Water Quality Index Using Neuro Fuzzy Inference System	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												The groundwater near mines is contaminated heavily as regards acidity, alkalinity, toxicity, heavy mineral, and microbes. During rainy season, the mines are filled with the water which contaminates the groundwater and gradually disperses by percolating through the soil into urban area, making the water unsuitable for use. In addition, fertilizers used for agricultural purpose affect pH and nitrate content of groundwater. Hence, evaluation of WQI of groundwater is extremely important in urban areas close to mines to prepare for make remedial measures. To this end, the present study proposes an efficient methodology such as adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the prediction of water quality. The parameters used to assess water quality are usually correlated and this makes an assessment unreasonable. Therefore, the parameters are uncorrelated using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. The uncorrelated parameters values are fuzzified to take into account uncertainty and impreciseness during data collection and experimentation. An efficient rule base and optimal distribution of membership function is constructed from the hybrid learning algorithm of ANFIS. The model performed quite satisfactorily with the actual and predicted water quality. The model can also be used for estimating water quality on-line, but the accuracy of the model depends upon the proper training and selection of parameters.

Identification of types of land cover features through satellite image is critical for meeting requirements related to sustainabile management, environmental regulation and policy development for any region. Hence, periodic assessment of spatially distributed cover features through distinct and non-overlapping approaches is the need. In the current study, we aimed to examine the ability of OBIA for optical satellite imagery obtained from LISS IV sensor of the year 2021, with a spatial resolution of 5.8 m during the Rabi season in Pune region, Maharashtra, India. The current study also compare the effectiveness of four different machine learning based classifiers i.e., Perceptron, Sigmoid, MP Neuron and Classification And Regression Tree (CART) integrated with OBIA approach for accurate land use land cover classification. The maximum accuracy was achieved as 75.2% over the iterative process. The agricultural land covered was estimated to be 84.97 km2. The overall classification accuracy of perceptron function was 53.6%, Sigmoid function (73.7%) and CART (75.2%). The study revealed that CART method produced an impressive classification result than the MP neuron considering the time and complexity in developing the algorithm for a smaller area too. By leveraging the spatial context and semantic information captured by image objects, OBIA integrated with Machine Learning approaches offer new opportunities for improved understanding of LULC classification and analysis of remote sensing datasets, contributing to a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, urban planning, natural resource management, and beyond to achieve United Nation's sustainable development goals.					kumar, rajiv/AEP-4640-2022														0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2025	53	3					731	749		10.1007/s12524-024-01997-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-024-01997-w													WOS:001439311100002

Results presented herein were compared with those obtained from the same system five years ago. Chemico-physical data showed higher temperatures and lower levels of pH and conductivity than in the past. The macrobenthic invertebrate community varied through the seasons and through the years, though they are dominated by few taxa, such as Asellus and Gammarus. These shredders were the most abundant functional feeding guild, playing a pivotal role in the decomposition of the vegetal organic matter. Decomposition rates k ranged between 0.009 and 0.016 days(-1) and varied seasonally. k values were different from those previously reported for the investigated system. Differences are mainly due to changes in water supply, depending on decreasing rainfall regimes and hydrometric levels of the Soca River, which showed lower levels than in the previous study. Changes in water supply altered the fluctuating pulse that is typical of ephemeral karstic lakes, changing the system dynamics. Potential effects of climate change on local scale are also discussed.					; Prearo, Marino/AAF-3369-2021; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019	Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Prearo, Marino/0000-0002-2847-6006														1424-2818				JUN	2022	14	6							460	10.3390/d14060460	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14060460													WOS:000816016800001

Seasonal variations in the kinetics of extracellular aminopeptidase (LAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), together with the composition of phytoplankton and concentrations of N and P, were examined from Jun 2013 to September 2014 in a Chinese shallow lake in which two basins had contrasting trophic states. The turbid basin had a significantly higher concentration of chlorophyll a and lower ratios of N to P. In parallel, the turnover time of organic N mediated by LAP (T-LAP) was significantly shorter, and its maximum velocity (V-max) was significantly higher compared to those in the clear basin. Considering data from both basins, there were linear decreases in N/P and the ratios between dissolved inorganic N and total N with an increasing trophic state index, coupled with a significantly positive relationship between N/P and LAPT. Additionally, with decreasing TN/TP, the Michaelis constant (K-m) of the AP increased linearly, reducing the efficiency of P regeneration. In contrast, the Km value of LAP decreased, and V-max increased, which enhanced Nmineralization by simultaneously increasing the reaction velocity and improving the affinity for substrate. Additionally, the K-m value of LAP was significantly related to that of AP and the ammonium concentration. Thus, substrate affinity acted as a key factor modifying the pathways of enzymatic degradation of organic N and P according to their stoichiometry in the water column. Phytoplankton composition was directly linked to LAPT. Overall, this study seemed to be the first to connect a stoichiometric shift of N and P with kinetics of extracellular enzymes responsible for their regeneration along trophic gradients, presenting an additional pathway to overcome nitrogen deficiency in eutrophic lakes.

Soil traits are one of several fluctuating environmental variables. To determine the effects of soil variables on stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) abundances during decomposition, we performed a field experiment using Carex cineruscens along a groundwater level gradient (GT-L: 25 to 50 cm, GT-LM: 15 to 25 cm, GT-MH: 5 to 15 cm, GT-H: 5 to 5 cm) in a shallow lake. Twelve soil properties including total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (N), pH, moisture, bulk density, clay, silt, sand, peroxidase, cellulase, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and microbial biomass nitrogen were measured in surface soil samples to assess soil environmental conditions. Analyses were performed to determine the effects of soil traits and lignin degradation on changes in stable isotope abundances. This study revealed that stable isotope abundances were significantly lower at high groundwater levels than at low groundwater levels. Lignin degradation was associated with a decrease in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundances. These two stable isotopes were positively related with soil N and bulk density, but negatively with pH and microbial quotient (MBC/TOC). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that soil variables and lignin decay rates explained 80.1% of the rinC variation and 42.8% of the "615N variation. Soil chemical and biological variables exhibited significant interactions with lignin decay rates, indicating they may affect stable isotope abundances via complex mechanisms. Our results indicate that the change in stable isotope abundances during decomposition may be affected directly by soil variables or indirectly through lignin degradation. Our results provide useful insight for understanding the roles litter decomposition and soil traits in changing environmental conditions of seasonal floodplain wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, it is assumed that success of an invasive species can largely depend on the plasticity of its life-history traits, e.g., indicated by higher investment in reproduction in the initial stage of its invasion. On the other hand, such energy allocation to production of gonads should negatively impact somatic growth rate. The aim of this article was to explore this phenomenon in a non-native population of Amur sleeper inhabiting artificial reservoir on a large lowland river in Central Europe. Through analysis of the population age structure, sex-dependent growth rate and life-history traits we assessed investment in reproduction and its possible relationship with growth pattern as well as compared the results with literature data from native and introduced range. Samples collected monthly from April 2005 to March 2006 were used to estimate sex ratio, GSI, fecundity, eggs diameter frequency over the year, duration of spawning season, and mode of spawning. Age structure was calculated from scales and the same data were also used to back-calculate standard length (SL) at age. The population in the Wocawski Reservoir was represented by eight age groups, and its life span was one of the longest recorded both in its natural range and introduced areas. The weight-length relationship showed that the Amur sleeper grew isometrically and there was no difference between females and males. Although the Amur sleeper growth rate was relatively slow in the Wocawski Reservoir, its increment in the first year of life was comparable to that in other introduced areas and higher than in its natural range. The female age of maturation (1+) found in the reservoir was earlier than observed in its natural range as well as in most introduced areas (2+, 3+). Female length at maturation was similar to that reported elsewhere. The back-calculated standard length (SL) of females and males showed that in the first two age classes (1 and 2) males achieved larger SL than females. Meanwhile, at age 3, 4 and 5, females were larger than males but these differences were insignificant, except for class 5. For both sexes the average annual increment of SL decreased with age but in females the increment was always higher than in males (P < 0.05). The growth rate differences between females and males resulted possibly from their unequal investment in reproduction. Multiple spawning in the Wocawski Reservoir lasted from April to the end of August and was almost 3 months longer than in other regions. Thus, this higher investment in reproduction displayed by, e.g., earlier maturation of females and longer spawning season in the Wocawski Reservoir, may contribute to invasive success of Amur sleeper in newly colonized areas; however, the costs of this strategy result in slower growth in older age classes.					; Grabowska, Joanna/K-8305-2013; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/IXD-6486-2023	Przybylski, Miroslaw/0000-0001-5786-5695; Marszal, Lidia/0000-0003-0171-6257; Grabowska, Joanna/0000-0001-9924-0650; Pietraszewski, Dariusz/0000-0003-0235-6185; Tarkan, Ali Serhan/0000-0001-8628-0514; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	661	1					197	210		10.1007/s10750-010-0524-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0524-0													WOS:000285064900017

Epipelic (EPP), epilithic (EPL) and epifitic (EPF) diatoms were seasonally collected from 12 stations in 2012 along the Seydisuyu Stream Basin and some physical and chemical water quality parameters (temperature, salinity, TDS, pH, ORP, conductivity, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate) were measured during the field and laboratory studies. Biological Diatom Index (IBD) was used to assess the water quality of the basin and some mono (Pearson Correlation Index and Matrixplot Distribution Diagrams) and multi (Cluster Analysis and Factor Analysis) statistical methods were applied to detected all physical, chemical and biological data. According to data observed, Seydisuyu Stream Basin has II. - III. Class water quality in terms of investigated water quality parameters (Turkish Regulations) and a total of 48 diatom species were recorded for the basin by counting a total of 22.229 valves. Cymbella lanceolata, Diatoma vulgare, Fragilaria construens, Hantzschia amphioxys, Meridion circulare, Navicula cincta, Neidium iridis, Navicula venata, Pinnularia brebissonii, Synedra acus and Surirella ovata were the most dominant species in the region. According to result of IBD, the investigated region was in a mesotrophic state and has a moderate water quality. According to results of Factor Analysis, 9 factors explained 81.29% of the total variance and according to results of Cluster Analysis, stational similarity coefficients were determined as IBD Indices (0.98) > Environmental Parameters (0.85) > Diatom Flora (0.77) respectively.

Variation in home range size and patterns in adult female American crocodiles Crocodylus acutus	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH												The American crocodile Crocodylus acutus is a threatened species that uses relatively deep, open-water habitats with low salinity. Adult female American crocodiles nest on sandy coastal beaches, islands or human-made berms, assist in the hatching process, and can travel long distances to nesting habitat. We satellite-tracked 15 adult female American crocodiles in 2 hydrologically distinct areas in Everglades National Park, Florida, USA, to quantify the home range sizes, test for intraspecific differences in home range and core area size and structure, and identify important crocodile high-use areas. Overall home ranges (95% kernel density estimate; KDE) for adult female crocodiles in South Florida ranged from 30.0 to 141.9 km(2) (meant +/- SD, 84.4 +/- 32.3 km(2)), and core areas (50% KDE) ranged from 4.7 to 27.4 km(2) (17.8 +/- 7.3 km(2)). We identified patterns in home range and core area overlap, seasonally shifting patterns in core area use, and the Fox Lake complex as an important crocodile high-use area. As the population of American crocodiles continues to grow and expand into new areas, it is important for conservation managers to understand individual crocodile habitat-use patterns and spatial resource requirements.																			1863-5407	1613-4796					2018	36						161	171		10.3354/esr00900	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr00900													WOS:000438416600008

Sixteen PAHs were analyzed in 17 paired sets of water and sediment samples collected from the study area. The concentrations of PAHs in water and sediment showed spatial-temporal variations, the concentrations in water ranged from 167.6 to 373.9 ng/L with a mean value of 227.9 ng/L in the normal season, from 186.0 to 386.9 ng/L with a mean value of 281.6 ng/L in the wet season, and ranged from 147.0 to 315.9 ng/L with an average value of 218.6 ng/L in the dry season, while concentrations in sediment varied from 895.6 to 2,518.2 ng/g with a mean value of 1,739.4 ng/g in the normal season, from 1,233.0 to 4,763.0 ng/g with a mean value of 2,122.6 ng/g in the wet season, and ranged from 914.2 to 5,678.5 ng/g with an average value of 1,943.7 ng/g in the dry season. Partitioning of PAHs in water and sediment was studied and the result showed that PAHs tend to absorb in sediment. Ecological risk assessments were conducted based on the species-sensitivity distribution (SSD) model, with results suggesting that ecological risks of individual PAHs in water and sediment were little, and the multiple congeners of PAHs in sediment from some sampling sites had ecological risks. Primary sources of 16 PAHs in water and sediment were identified with isomer ratios, and results indicated that primary sources of PAHs in water were identified as a mixture pattern of petroleum and combustion sources, and in sediment were identified as a mixture pattern of petroleum and grass, wood and coal combustion sources.					sun, caiyun/LKL-3227-2024; Zhang, Feng/GNM-9991-2022														1230-1485	2083-5906					2018	27	2					579	589		10.15244/pjoes/75827	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/75827													WOS:000424111300011

Time series of surface reflectance (visible wavelengths) and brightness temperature above background (thermal infrared wavelengths) were calculated. Color was defined in the RGB (red-green-blue) and HSV (hue-saturation-value) color spaces, and we introduce a visualization concept called "hue stretch" to consistently represent hue through time. These parameters display long-term trends, seasonal cycles and short duration bursts of activity at the lakes. We demonstrate that the color of the lakes are related over a period of months to years and discovered a previously unreported but significant episode around 1997, which included large agglomerations of floating elemental sulfur. Globally speaking, these techniques could reveal trends at any of the similar to 100 crater lakes on active volcanoes. Furthermore, they could apply to any target whose color changes through time (e.g., forests, crops, and non-volcanic water bodies). We have open-sourced the code necessary to perform these analyses.

Evidence for a size-structured explanation of partial diel vertical migration in mysids	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Mysids are known for benthic-pelagic diel vertical migration (DVM), where the population is benthic by day and pelagic by night. However, historical and recent observations in members of the Mysis relicta complex suggests populations exhibit partial DVM, with some remaining benthic at night. We used pelagic net and benthic sled tows to assess diel habitat use by Mysis diluviana at two stations (60 and 100 m deep) in Lake Champlain, USA, during June-November 2015. At both stations, mysids were on the bottom both day and night, but the extent of pelagic habitat use by Mysis varied by site depth. At 60-m, pelagic densities were an order of magnitude lower during the day compared to at night, indicative of benthic-pelagic DVM. Contrary to expectations, we found no diel difference between pelagic and benthic sled density estimates at 100-m, suggesting an equal number of Mysis are benthic day and night, and an equal number are pelagic-day and night at deeper sites. Mean body length of benthic-caught mysids was greater than pelagic-caught individuals, a pattern that was evident both day and night at 100-m. Our findings indicate Mysis partial DVM is common across seasons and influenced by body size and depth.

Three models are used to establish the predictive methodology: the Infoworks model for the combined sewer service area, the Hydrologic Simulation-F model for the remainder of the watershed, and the MIKE 3 computer code to evaluate Lake Ontario response to control. Each model was calibrated with E. coli densities observed respectively in sewer discharges, instream, and in the Inner Harbour. Two indices are used to evaluate the response of water quality in the Inner Harbour - fraction of the surface area achieving Blue Flag status, and portion of the swimming season (June to August) above recreation objectives. Analyses of control options led to the recommendation that virtual elimination of combined sewer overflows (one overflow per season control strategy) should be pursued, rather than the lower level of control of 90% volumetric control, which is the minimum provincial environmental requirement. Implementation of priority projects for improving water quality along the Toronto waterfront, including the Don River and Central Waterfront project, are integral to delisting Toronto as a Great Lakes Area of Concern.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2018	21	3			SI		245	254		10.1080/14634988.2018.1507528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2018.1507528													WOS:000446707400004
J	Yang, C; Cai, XB; Wang, XL				Yang, Chao; Cai, Xiaobin; Wang, Xuelei			Remote Sensing of Hydrological Changes in Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow Lake, an Ungauged Area of the Yangtze River Basin	REMOTE SENSING												The hydrological pattern changes have a great influence on the wetland environment. However, some important wetland areas often lack historical observations due to economic and physical conditions. The Tian-e-Zhou oxbow lake wetland is an important habitat for two endangered species and also has very little historical hydrological data. Remote sensing images can be used to explore the historical water area fluctuation of lakes. In addition, remote sensing can also be used to obtain historical water levels based on the water boundary elevation integrated with a topographic data (WBET) method or the level-surface area relationship curve (LRC) method. In order to minimize the uncertainty of the derived results, both methods were introduced in the extraction of the water level of Tian-e-Zhou during 1992-2015. The results reveal that the hydrological regime of the oxbow lake has experienced a significant change after the Shatanzi Levee construction in 1998. With the impact of the levee, the mean annual water surface area of the lake was reduced by 5.8 km(2) during the flood season, but, during the non-flood season, it was increased by 1.35 km(2). For the same period, the water level of the lake during the flood season also showed a 1.47 m (WBET method) or 3.21 m (LRC method) decrease. The mean annual water level increased by 1.12 m (WBET method) or 0.75 m (LRC method). Both results had a good accuracy with RMSE (root-mean-square errors) of less than 0.4 m. Furthermore, the water level differences between the Yangtze River channel and the oxbow lake increased by at least 0.5 m. It is found that the hydrological pattern of the oxbow lake changed significantly after the levee construction, which could bring some disadvantages to the habitats of the two endangered species.																			2072-4292					JAN	2018	10	1							27	10.3390/rs10010027	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10010027													WOS:000424092300026

Here we evaluated the driving forces exerted by a large set of environmental and biological parameters on the temporal and spatial dynamics of free-living bacterial community structures (BCS) in two neighboring perialpine lakes, Lake Bourget and Lake Annecy, which differ in trophic status. We analyzed monthly data from a 1-year sampling period at two depths situated in the epi- and hypolimnia for each lake. Overall, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed significant differences in the BCS in the two lakes, characterized by a higher number of bands in the oligotrophic ecosystem (i.e., Lake Annecy). The temporal dynamics of BCS differed greatly between depths and lakes, with temporal scale patterns being much longer in the mesotrophic Lake Bourget. Direct-gradient multivariate ordination analyses showed that a complex array of biogeochemical parameters was the driving force behind BCS shifts in both lakes. Our results indicated that 60 to 80% of the variance was explained only by the bottom-up factors in both lakes, indicating the importance of nutrients and organic matter from autotrophic origin in controlling the BCS. Top-down regulation by flagellates together with ciliates or viruses was found only in the hypolimnion and not in the epilimnion for both lakes and explained less than 18% of the bacterial community changes during the year. Our study suggests that the temporal dynamics of the free-living bacterial community structure in deep perialpine lakes are dependent mainly on bottom-up factors and to a lesser extent on top-down factors, whatever the specific environmental conditions of these lakes.

Changes in diatom assemblages since pre-industrial times in 40 reference lakes from the Experimental Lakes Area (northwestern Ontario, Canada)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom assemblages in recent versus pre-industrial sediments were examined in 40 relatively undisturbed lakes from the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA). The ELA region of northwestern Ontario receives low amounts of acidic deposition and the lakes have been minimally disturbed by watershed development or other human activities. Consequently, this region represents an important location to detect possible changes in lakes due to climate change. In over half of the lakes, planktonic taxa (especially Discostella stelligera) increased between 10 and 40% since pre-industrial times. Changes in diatom assemblages are consistent with taxa that would benefit from enhanced stratification and a longer ice-free season. We hypothesized that there should be a relationship between stratification and measured chemical and physical characteristics of the study lakes. Multiple correlation analysis was undertaken to see the relationship between planktonic taxa and D. stelligera since pre-industrial times and the physical and chemical characteristics of the study lakes. Lake depth was consistently identified as an important variable. The timing of the increase in planktonic taxa within cores from these lakes will be needed to rule out other possible regional changes that may also be occurring in the ELA region.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2011	46	1					1	15		10.1007/s10933-011-9504-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9504-2													WOS:000293144700001

Parasite fauna of native and non-native populations of Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814) (Gobiidae) in the longitudinal profile of the Danube River	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>Parasite fauna of round goby Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814) in the Danube River was investigated in both its native range (two sites in the Bulgarian stretch of the Danube) and non-native range of distribution (Croatian, Slovak and Austrian stretches) during 2005 and 2006. The aim was to identify possible changes in parasite communities associated with the introduction of a host into the new environment. A total of 29 metazoan parasite species were found to parasitize round goby in the Danube River; twelve of these parasite species were found in both the native and non-native range of distribution. Introduction of a novel parasite species to the non-native range via the round goby was not found. Eight parasite species occurred only in the native range and nine species only in the non-native range of the round goby distribution. Losses of native parasite species in non-native round goby populations and/or acquiring of novel parasite species in a new environment were not significant. Thirteen parasite taxa were recorded for the first time in round gobies. Three parasite taxa (Diplostomum spp., Pomphorhynchus laevis and Raphidascaris acus) were found in high prevalence and abundance at each sampling site in both the native and non-native range. Parasite species diversity was assessed for each sampling site and season using three diversity indices (the Shannon, Simpson and Equitability indices), with the highest same-season values found in a non-native site in Slovakia (1.38, 0.69 and 0.60, respectively) and the lowest in a native site in Bulgaria (0.28, 0.12 and 0.14, respectively). Species diversity was higher in both non-native round goby populations (Slovak and Austrian) compared to native Bulgarian populations. However, diversity indices values varied among almost all sampling sites.

J	Donohue, I; Donohue, LA; Ainín, BN; Irvine, K				Donohue, Ian; Donohue, Louise A.; Ainin, Blaithin Ni; Irvine, Kenneth			Assessment of eutrophication pressure on lakes using littoral invertebrates	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Until the E.U. Water Framework Directive listed benthic invertebrates as a biotic element to be used for ecological classification of lakes, techniques for the assessment of the response of littoral invertebrates to anthropogenic pressures were extremely limited compared with those of rivers and lake profundal zones. We describe here the development of an ecological classification model based on changes of littoral invertebrate assemblages across a gradient of eutrophication, which is the most widespread anthropogenic pressure on lakes across Europe. The model comprises three derived parameters, two of which were developed from taxon-specific optima along a total phosphorus gradient calculated using canonical correspondence analysis, and the third based on invertebrate abundance. Combining the parameter metrics, we can estimate the ecological quality ratio (EQR), relative to those from paleolimnologically-confirmed reference lakes. The model was tested using independent samples collected from both hard and soft substrata and across two seasons from 45 lakes, comprising three alkalinity groups (n = 15 in each), and across gradients in water column total phosphorus concentrations. For hard substrata, EQRs were related consistently and highly significantly to water column concentrations of total phosphorus, accounting for the majority of the variance in every alkalinity group. For samples taken from soft substrata, a significant relationship was found only for high alkalinity lakes, accounting for a moderate proportion of the variability in water column total phosphorus concentrations. Our results compare highly favourably with those from other aquatic ecological assessment methods, irrespective of the faunal or floral group upon which they are based, demonstrating that littoral invertebrate assemblages can provide a statistically robust prediction of nutrient status when samples are collected from hard substrata. While the method was developed specifically to assess nutrient pressures on littoral invertebrates, many lakes are subject to multiple pressures. The development of classification models that incorporate multiple pressures presents a particularly significant challenge for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, requiring both reliable identification of minimally-impacted reference states and incorporation of pressures that are unlikely to interact in predictable ways.

S. Snowfall Using a Quality-Controlled Dataset	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												A quality assessment of daily manual snowfall data has been undertaken for all U. S. long-term stations and their suitability for climate research. The assessment utilized expert judgment on the quality of each station. Through this process, the authors have identified a set of stations believed to be suitable for analysis of trends. Since the 1920s, snowfall has been declining in the West and the mid-Atlantic coast. In some places during recent years the decline has been more precipitous, strongly trending downward along the southern margins of the seasonal snow region, the southern Missouri River basin, and parts of the Northeast. Snowfall has been increasing since the 1920s in the lee of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes northern Ohio Valley, and parts of the north-central United States. These areas that are in opposition to the overall pattern of declining snowfall seem to be associated with specific dynamical processes, such as upslope snow and lake-effect snow that may be responding to changes in atmospheric circulation.
