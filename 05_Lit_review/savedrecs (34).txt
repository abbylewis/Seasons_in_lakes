J	DODDS, WK; PRISCU, JC				DODDS, WK; PRISCU, JC			A COMPARISON OF METHODS FOR ASSESSMENT OF NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A LARGE OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Short-term (h) and long-term (d) changes in phytoplankton community physiology and biomass in response to nutrient enrichment were used concomitantly as bioassays of phytoplankton nutrient deficiency in oligotrophic Flathead Lake, Montana, six times over the course of a year. Long-term bioassays consisted of nutrient and amendments to epilimnetic water in 20 L containers which were subsequently monitored for algal growth. Short-term bioassays included measurement of NH+4 stimulation of dark carbon fixation, measurement of PO43- and NH4+ uptake over time to assess depletion of internal pools and stimulation effects of PO43- on NH4+ uptake and NH4+ on PO43- uptake. During thermal stratification, simultaneous additions of NH4+ and PO43- in long-term bioassays caused significant increases in chlorophyll a concentration, photosynthetic 14CO2 uptake, and particulte N concentration within 4.5 d; single additions of NH4+ or PO43- had little or no effect. During winter mixing there was little evidence for N or P deficiency in either short- or long-term bioassays. In general, short-term bioassays did not consistently agree with each other or with long-term bioassays. Our results suggest that it may be necessary to elicit growth of phytoplankton with nutrient addition to make definitive statements regarding nutrient deficiency.

This study uses descriptive data to examine the shift in dominance in the rotifer community in summer from Keratella cochlearis to Anuraeopsis fissa in a shallow eutrophic lake. Population density and egg ratio were estimated from May to September for these small loricate rotifers, as well as the soft-bodied Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra spp., to compare rates of population increase, birth and death. 2. Keratella cochlearis was succeeded by A. fissa in late May, perhaps as a result of the shorter egg development times of the latter at temperatures > 15 degrees C, and species-specific responses to food and predation. Population variables suggest that the decline of K. cochlearis was the result of a food shortage which caused a decrease in reproduction and increased mortality. 3. High population densities of A. fissa and Polyarthra spp. were associated with low egg ratios, birth rates and rates of increase within a species, suggesting intraspecific competition. The egg ratios of the two soft-bodied rotifers were strongly intercorrelated in the study period, although their diets supposedly differ. The egg ratios of A. fissa showed positively correlated fluctuations with the abundance of diatoms. 4. Short periods of higher rates of increase of A. fissa conferred advantage to this rotifer and manifested in its dominance. The mean birth rates of A. fissa and F. longiseta were twice as high as for K. cochlearis. Furthermore, death rates of loricate and soft-bodied rotifers were similar and high, which suggests that food shortage similarly increased death rates, or that predation may be sometimes substantial for soft-bodied and loricate species, or both. 5. Predation was probably not an important factor in steering the seasonal succession in the lake. A difference in abilities of the studied rotifers to exploit resources seems more important. Perhaps temperature is also a factor, but the specifics remain unclear and await more experimental work.

Summer nitrate uptake and denitrification in an upper Mississippi River backwater lake: the role of rooted aquatic vegetation	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In-stream nitrogen processing in the Mississippi River has been suggested as one mechanism to reduce coastal eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico. Aquatic macrophytes in river channels and flood plain lakes have the potential to temporarily remove large quantities of nitrogen through assimilation both by themselves and by the attached epiphyton. In addition, rooted macrophytes act as oxygen pumps, creating aerobic microsites around their roots where coupled nitrification-denitrification can occur. We used in situ N-15-NO3 (-) tracer mesocosm experiments to measure nitrate assimilation rates for macrophytes, epiphyton, and microbial fauna in the sediment in Third Lake, a backwater lake of the upper Mississippi River during June and July 2005. We measured assimilation over a range of nitrate concentrations and estimated a nitrate mass balance for Third Lake. Macrophytes assimilated the most nitrate (29.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) followed by sediment microbes (14.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and epiphytes (5.7 mg N m(-2) d(-1))(.) Assimilation accounted for 6.8% in June and 18.6% in July of total nitrate loss in the control chambers. However, denitrification (292.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) is estimated to account for the majority (82%) of the nitrate loss. Assimilation and denitrification rates generally increased with increasing nitrate concentration but denitrification rates plateaued at about 5 mg N L-1. This suggests that backwaters have the potential to remove a relatively high amount of nitrate but will likely become saturated if the load becomes too large.

Biomass loss and nutrient release from decomposing aquatic macrophytes: effects of detrital mixing	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Aquatic plant decomposition is typically studied on species held separately, whereas diverse plant communities are usually found in lake littoral zones and decomposition occurs as mixtures of multiple species. Here, we examined whether detrital mixing affects the rate of aquatic macrophyte decomposition. Specifically, we measured decomposition rates of detritus from four species (Myriophyllum heterophyllum, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha x glauca, and Potamogeton robinsii) in single, double, triple, and quadruple species mixtures held over two summer months in a mesotrophic lake in southern Ontario, Canada. We measured detrital mass loss after different time periods for all combinations. There were limited effects of mixing on decomposition rates with inhibitory effects observed in only two of the eleven multi-species mixtures. Decomposition rates of single and mixed species detritus varied with initial C:N and C:P ratios with faster rates seen for more nutrient-rich detritus. Overall, there was no effect of detrital species richness on macrophyte decomposition rates other than smaller differences among the averages of more species-rich mixtures. Our results were inconsistent with interactive effects of mixing on decomposition rates of multiple aquatic plant taxa. Instead, we found decomposition rates of mixed species communities were largely predicted by biomass composition and single-species decomposition estimates. There were also no apparent effects of species mixing on N- or P-specific fluxes or the ratio of these fluxes that resulted during decomposition during our experiment. Our results indicate that future changes in aquatic plant biodiversity may affect rates of decomposition in these ecosystems, but these should be largely predictable based on changes in plant communities and their biomass-weighted stoichiometry.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Banks, Lauren/0000-0001-6197-4245; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2017	79	4					881	890		10.1007/s00027-017-0539-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0539-y													WOS:000410781000008

Thus, this work has as main aim toydeterminate and to assess the behavior of chlorophyll-a in the Itaparica reservoir, Sao Francisco river. This way, we used Landsat-TM imagery, in which it was used bands from 1 to 5 and 7. The algorithm used was written in LEGAL/SPRING 5.2. From the chlorophyll-a result was held slicing the water body in six concentration classes. As observed by histogram, the minimum value of Chl-a was < 1 mu g/L and the highest was 249.5 mu g/L. The classes that had the biggest area were Classe 01 (0-5 mu g/L) with 27.4%, followed by Classe 02 (5-10 mu g/L) with 24.6% of the total area of the study area. Through graphical analysis of points located along the reservoir it was possible to verify that chlorophyll concentration augmented from fluvial to lacustrine region and from the contact of streams with reservoir. In the next studies there is a need to validate the values with field data in order to verify the mapping accuracy in this reservoir, taking into account the day and also the transit time of the sensor.					; do Carmo Sobral, Maria/G-9230-2015; Candeias, Ana/LOR-3614-2024	Candeias, Ana/0000-0002-9021-7603; 													1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-SEP	2015	20	3					475	484		10.1590/S1413-41522015020000111066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-41522015020000111066													WOS:000365290900016

Re-flooding a Historically Drained Wetland Leads to Rapid Sediment Phosphorus Release	ECOSYSTEMS												Wetland restoration provides many benefits, but re-flooding historically drained land can have unintended negative consequences, including phosphorus (P) release from sediments. To investigate the effects of re-flooding on P cycling, this study monitored a restoration in Michigan that back-flooded old drainage ditches and re-flooded former wetland soils. Immediately after re-flooding, previously exposed sediments released substantial amounts of P to the water column. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in re-flooded areas were as high as 750 mu g P l(-1). At peak P concentrations, there were about 20 times more SRP and 14 times more total P in the surface water than in the much smaller flooded area that existed before re-flooding. Prolific growth of filamentous algae and duckweed was observed in subsequent summers. Sedimental analyses suggest that most of the P released originated from iron-bound fractions. The highest SRP concentrations occurred during the first year when surface water dissolved oxygen was low (< 5.5 mg l(-1)). Similarly low oxygen in the second year after flooding was not associated with such high P concentrations. After 1 year postflooding, SRP concentrations remained below 50 mu g P l(-1) (but still high enough to produce eutrophic conditions) until the end of sampling about 15 months after re-flooding. When re-flooding historically drained soils, managers should consider the potential for sediment P release to jeopardize restoration goals and therefore should incorporate longer term monitoring of water quality into restoration plans. Knowledge of sediment P amounts and forms can indicate the potential for P release to overlying water.

The picocyanobacteria represented different pigment types (phycoerythrin-rich, PE, and phycocyanin-rich, PC) and phylogenetic clusters. The grazing experiments were conducted with laboratory cultures acclimated to 10 mu mol photon/m(2)/sec (low light, LL) and 100 mu mol photon/m(2)/sec (moderate light, ML), either in the dark or at four different irradiances ranging from low (6 mu mol photon/m(2)/sec) to high (1,500 mu mol photon/m(2)/sec) light intensity. Poterioochromonas malhamensis preferred the larger, green PC-rich picocyanobacteria to the smaller, red PE-rich picocyanobacterial, and heterotrophic bacteria. The feeding and growth rates of P. malhamensis were sensitive to the actual light conditions during the experiments; the flagellate performed relatively better in the dark and at LL conditions than at high light intensity. In summary, our results found strain-specific ingestion and growth rates of the flagellate; an effect of the preculturing conditions, and, unexpectedly, a direct adverse effect of high light levels. We conclude that this flagellate may avoid exposure to high surface light intensities commonly encountered in temperate lakes during the summer.

J	DEMOTT, WR				DEMOTT, WR			OPTIMAL FORAGING BY A SUSPENSION-FEEDING COPEPOD - RESPONSES TO SHORT-TERM AND SEASONAL-VARIATION IN FOOD RESOURCES	OECOLOGIA												Laboratory radioisotope experiments were used to investigate the effects of phytoplankton seasonal succession on the selectivity and clearance rates of a suspension-feeding copepod in two Indiana lakes. Responses to particle size and quality were tested by allowing adult female Diaptomus birgei feeding in natural seston to select between a small (6x7 mu m) flagellate (Chlamydomonas reinhardii) and a large, poor quality food (heat-killed Carteria olivieri, 22x25 mu m). Short-term responses were tested in one lake by additional treatments in which copepods were acclimated for 5-6 h in filtered lake water (''starved'') or natural seston with added Chlamydomonas (''enriched''). Copepods from both lakes fed selectively on the small live flagellate during the spring bloom of edible phytoplankton but fed selectively on the larger, poor quality particle during the ''clear water phase'' when food was scarce. These results are interpreted as an interaction between the concentration-dependent selectivity for high quality foods predicted by optimal diet theory and a perceptual bias for large-sized particles. Selectivity for high-quality food was intermediate and clearance rates were depressed when total phytoplankton abundance was high but dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria. In each experiment copepods also responded to the short-term manipulations by exhibiting weaker discrimination against the poor quality par ticle in the starvation treatment and stronger discrimination in the enriched treatment. A two-way mixed model ANOVA revealed substantial short term (37%) and seasonal (53%) components to the total variance in selectivity. Clearance rates were also influenced by both phytoplankton succession and the short-term resource manipulations. As expected, clearance rates on the poor quality food were more sensitive to the abundance of alternative foods. These results show how the feeding behavior of a freshwater copepod is modulated by both seasonal and short-term variation in natural food.																			0029-8549					AUG	1995	103	2					230	240		10.1007/BF00329085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00329085								28306778					WOS:A1995RN78300014

White-tailed deer herbivory impacts on tree seedling and sapling abundance in the Lake States Region of the USA	ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE												Key message White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana Zimmermann) browsing reduces seedling and sapling abundance of more palatable winter woody browse such as Tsuga canadensis L. Carriere, Thuja occidentalis L., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, and Pinus strobus L. across the Lake States Region of the USA. Context White-tailed deer consume buds and twigs of tree seedlings and saplings as forage. Deer populations in the Lake States Region of the USA have increased over recent decades due to a decrease in predators and an increase in habitat fragmentation. Higher deer population densities present challenges to regeneration of tree species. Aims The objective of this work was to quantify the effects of deer browsing on tree seedling and sapling abundance and species richness of woody tree species which vary in deer browse palatability. Methods Deer browsing impact measurements from the tree regeneration indicator from the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program were used to predict seedling and sapling abundance from overstory basal area and a deer browsing index in the Lake States Region. Results Overstory basal area was important in predicting seedling and sapling abundance for all species (p < 0.05). Deer browsing affected seedling and sapling abundance differently across species, with the most palatable species showing lower stocking or negligible effects with browse. Conclusion Results support the importance of quantifying impacts of deer browsing for use in determining the survival and abundance of palatable species in the smallest size cohorts.

J	Fortin, MC; Gajewski, K				Fortin, Marie-Claude; Gajewski, Konrad			Multiproxy paleoecological evidence of Holocene climatic changes on the Boothia Peninsula, Canadian Arctic	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A study of chironomid remains in the sediments of Lake JR01 on the Boothia Peninsula in the Central Canadian Arctic provides a high-resolution record of mean July air temperatures for the last 6.9 ka. Diatom and pollen studies have previously been published from this core. Peak Holocene temperatures occurred prior to 5.0 ka, a time when overall aquatic and terrestrial biological production was high. Chironomid-inferred summer air temperatures reached up to 7.5 degrees C during this period. The region of Lake JR01 cooled over the mid- to late-Holocene, with high biological production between 6.1 and 5.4 ka. Biological production decreased again at similar to 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka, coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time. During transitions, either warming or cooling, chironomid production increases, suggesting an ecosystem-level response to climate variability, seen at a number of lakes across the Arctic.

The invasive Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) increases sediment denitrification and ammonium flux in 2 streams in the midwestern USA	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The invasive Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, can enhance conditions needed for denitrification, but the effects of C. fluminea on denitrification in streams have not been measured. In summer 2012, we incubated sand- and gravel-filled boxes in the North Branch of the Chicago River, Illinois (high nutrient), and Eagle Creek, Michigan, USA (low nutrient). One side of the box contained no clams (control), and the other contained C. fluminea. After 6 wk in situ, we measured inorganic N and dissolved-gas fluxes using a continuous-flow approach. At both sites, live C. fluminea significantly increased NH4+ and N-2 flux out of sediments and O-2 consumption (i.e., respiration) relative to control sediment. Clams did not affect NO3- flux. Clams probably increased NH4+ flux via direct NH4+ excretion or mineralization of clam wastes and increased N-2 flux through either increased coupled nitrification-denitrification or enhanced exchange of nutrients between water column and sediment via bioturbation (i.e., burrowing). We used benthic clam density in each stream to scale up effects of live C. fluminea on in situ N fluxes. In the low-nutrient stream, live clams increased NH4+ flux more than N-2 production. However, in the high-nutrient stream, live clams enhanced N-2 production more than NH4+ flux. The influence of dense assemblages of burrowing bivalves on denitrification may be an overlooked and potentially significant component of lotic N uptake in low- and high-N streams.

In high-mountain areas, firn and ice play a similar role. The consequent concentration peaks in surface waters can pose a risk to high-altitude ecosystems, since snow and ice melt often coincide with periods of intense biological activity. In such situations, the role of dynamic models can be crucial when assessing environmental behavior of contaminants and their accumulation patterns in aquatic organisms. In the present work, a dynamic fate modeling approach was combined to a hydrological module capable of estimating water discharge and snow/ice melt contributions on an hourly basis, starting from hourly air temperatures. The model was applied to the case study of the Frodolfo glacier-fed stream (Italian Alps), for which concentrations of a number of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) in stream water and four macroinvertebrate groups were available. Considering the uncertainties in input data, results showed a satisfying agreement for both water and organism concentrations. This study showed the model adequacy for the estimation of pollutant concentrations in surface waters and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, as well as its possible role in assessing the consequences of climate change on the cycle of POPs.

A unique feature of these lakes is the lack of an outlet; thus, they are defined as urban closed lakes (UCLs). UCLs are facing unexpected eutrophication under climate change and human activities. Our study assessed the trophic state, assimilative capacity (AC) and pollutant reduction of UCLs under different precipitation frequencies in Wuhan, China based on Carlson's Trophic State Index, assimilative capacity modelling, field investigations and observed data. The UCLs in Wuhan are nearly eutrophic in summer. Three primary nutrient sources are atmospheric deposition, pollutants carried in rainfall and nutrients released by sediments. TN and TP in the UCL water column are primarily contributed by surface runoff. The ACs of TN and TP in 2015 for Lingjiao Lake, Yue Lake, and Houxianghe Lake were 3472.07 kg, 13,800.99 kg, and 2805.58 kg, respectively, and 641.66 kg, 8386.79 kg, and 800.14 kg, respectively. The ACs of TN and TP were much higher at a 25% precipitation frequency (wet year) compared with a 50% frequency, and the lowest AC was observed at a 75% precipitation frequency (dry year). A comparison of the pollution load and AC showed that TN and TP reduction was highest in the dry and wet years, respectively. We found that specific meteorological conditions in the early stage led to the algal bloom. These results can facilitate governmental decision making in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite existing ecotourism potentials, the area has not been utilized for tourism for millennia. While previous work looked at the availability of natural resources, it did not identify and prioritize the resources, so knowledge gaps continue to exist in prioritization of potential ecotourism sites. This study attempted to identify various ecotourism indicators, evaluate and produce maps of suitable ecotourism sites, and prioritize optimum protected areas that are best suited for sustainable ecotourism development of Raya areas. For this analysis, 13 spatial indicators from physical, environmental, archaeological, socio-cultural, and socioeconomic sectors were considered. Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) was used to calculate the details of the spatial indicators and class weights. The suitability maps were classified into four classes as Highly Suitable (S1), Moderately Suitable (S2), Marginally Suitable (N1), and Not Suitable (N2). The results revealed 114.37 Km(2) (10.33%), 13.36 Km(2) (1.91%), and 10.39 Km(2) (1.62%) fall under the highly suitable class in Blocks B, A and C, respectively.

Travertine crystal growth ripples record the hydraulic history of ancient Rome's Anio Novus aqueduct	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Travertine crystal growth ripples are used to reconstruct the early hydraulic history of the Anio Novus aqueduct of ancient Rome. These crystalline morphologies deposited within the aqueduct channel record the hydraulic history of gravity-driven turbulent flow at the time of Roman operation. The wavelength, amplitude, and steepness of these travertine crystal growth ripples indicate that large-scale sustained aqueduct flows scaled directly with the thickness of the aqueous viscous sublayer. Resulting critical shear Reynolds numbers are comparable with those reconstructed from heat/mass transfer crystalline ripples formed in other natural and engineered environments. This includes sediment transport in rivers, lakes, and oceans, chemical precipitation and dissolution in caves, and melting and freezing in ice. Where flow depth and perimeter could be reconstructed from the distribution and stratigraphy of the travertine within the Anio Novus aqueduct, flow velocity and rate have been quantified by deriving roughness-flow relationships that are independent of water temperature. More generally, under conditions of near-constant water temperature and kinematic viscosity within the Anio Novus aqueduct channel, the travertine crystal growth ripple wavelengths increased with decreasing flow velocity, indicating that systematic changes took place in flow rate during travertine deposition. This study establishes that travertine crystal growth ripples such as those preserved in the Anio Novus provide a sensitive record of past hydraulic conditions, which can be similarly reconstructed from travertine deposited in other ancient water conveyance and storage systems around the world.

Here we report pollen-based July mean temperature (T-jul) and annual precipitation (P-ann) reconstructions from a sediment core from a high-altitude tree-line lake in northwestern Finland. The reconstructions suggest that at 9600-8300 cal yr B.P. T-jul values were low but steadily rising while P-ann was high. The period of warmest summers, with T-jul values ca. 1.8degrees-1.6degreesC higher than at present, occurred at ca. 8000-6500 cal yr B.P. Since then climate has become gradually cooler. T-jul values during the "Medieval Warm Period" (ca. 1400-1000 cal yr B.P.) were ca. 0.8degreesC higher that at present but decreased rapidly to the low "Little Ice Age" levels at 800 cal yr B.P. We compare these results with an earlier pollen-based climate reconstruction from the same region. The reconstructions indicate a similar general Holocene T-jul pattern with lower values in the reconstruction from the high-altitude take. However, most of the small-scale variations are not synchronous, suggesting that they may represent noise rather than signal in our data. (C) 2002 University of Washington.

In the spring of 2004 we conducted two days of physical and optical measurements in the lake. Because of the significant effect of dissolved salts on the optical properties of water, our analysis required a novel processing approach to obtain dissolved and total inherent optical properties from the measurements. In addition, we show that the lake's salinity can be estimated from measurements of hyper-spectral absorption or attenuation spectra in the red and infrared parts of the spectrum, using published values of specific absorption of dissolved NaCl, despite the fact that the lake's salt chemistry is complex. In situ observations demonstrated that the lake has a two-layer structure with a warm and more turbid layer at the top 20-30m and a clearer colder layer below. Both the particulate and dissolved absorption are well approximated by exponentially decreasing functions with the spectral slope of the particulate absorption about half that of the dissolved fraction and consistent with other aquatic environments. Both have relatively low and similar magnitudes in the blue (O(0.15m-1)). Mean particle size was observed to increase with depth, consistent with precipitating salt crystals (observed in past campaigns) shown here to play a major role in the lake's optical properties.					; Slade, Wayne/AAZ-8689-2020; Boss, Emmanuel/C-5765-2009; Gildor, Hezi/AAZ-6602-2021; Oren, Aharon/JOZ-0901-2023	Gildor, Hezi/0000-0003-0898-6292; Boss, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8334-9595; Slade, Wayne/0000-0003-1851-968X													2169-9275	2169-9291				APR	2013	118	4					1821	1829		10.1002/jgrc.20109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrc.20109													WOS:000320324100013
J	Hayward, SJ; Gouin, T; Wania, F				Hayward, Stephen J.; Gouin, Todd; Wania, Frank			Comparison of Four Active and Passive Sampling Techniques for Pesticides in Air	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Four sampling systems were evaluated for their ability to determine the concentrations of pesticides in the atmosphere of rural southern Ontario. Two active air samplers (AAS, high-volume and low-volume pumps) and two passive air samplers (PAS, polyurethane foam disks and XAD-resin) were deployed between March 2006 and September 2007 using different sampling frequencies (biweekly to annually) and durations (24 h to 1 yr). Concentrations of nine pesticides in air determined by the different systems were compared at time scales of two weeks, two months, and one year. Agreement in the average concentrations obtained by different techniques improved with increasing length of the comparison period, especially for pesticides with high short-term temporal concentration variability. Such variability was high for the most volatile and reactive pesticides (trifluralin and pendimethalin). Except for these two pesticides, the annually averaged air concentrations determined by the different systems are within a factor of 2.5 for all pesticides and are not statistically different Even though the PUF-PAS may have approached equilibrium with the atmosphere during deployment, the air concentrations are not statistically significantly different from those determined by AAS when averaged over longer time scales. Two month XAD-PAS deployments during the second summer resulted in sufficient sampling volumes to reliably establish air concentrations. If the sole purpose of collecting air samples is the assessment of long-term air concentration trends, this can be achieved most cost-effectively, i.e., with the least number of samples with year-long XAD-PAS.

J	Walter, F; Deichmann, N; Funk, M				Walter, Fabian; Deichmann, Nicholas; Funk, Martin			Basal icequakes during changing subglacial water pressures beneath Gornergletscher, Switzerland	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Using dense networks of three-component seismometers installed in direct contact with the ice, the seismic activity of Gornergletscher, Switzerland, was investigated during the summers of 2004 and 2006, as subglacial water pressures varied drastically. These pressure variations are due to the diurnal cycle of meltwater input as well as the subglacial drainage of Gornersee, a nearby marginal ice-dammed lake. Up to several thousand seismic signals per day were recorded. Whereas most icequakes are due to surface crevasse openings, about 200 events have been reliably located close to the glacier bed. These basal events tend to occur in clusters and have signals with impulsive first arrivals. At the same time, basal water pressures and ice-surface velocities were measured to capture the impact of the lake drainage on the subglacial hydrological system and the ice-flow dynamics. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe an increase of basal icequake activity as the lake emptied, thereby raising the subglacial water pressures close to the flotation level for several days. In fact, the basal icequakes were usually recorded during the morning hours, when the basal water pressure was either low or decreasing. During the high-pressure period caused by the drainage of the lake, no basal icequakes were observed. Furthermore, GPS measurements showed that the glacier surface was lowering during the basal seismic activity. These observations lead us to conclude that such icequakes are connected to the diurnal variation in glacier sliding across the glacier bed.

Assessment of potential reference sites for evaluating the ecological status of subtropical and temperate Brazilian lotic systems using the epilithic diatom community	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												This research aimed at determining reference sites in southern Brazilian lotic systems, using the Water Quality Trophic Index (WQTI), based on epilithic diatom communities. Within the period of 2012 and 2016, 140 epilithic diatom samples from seven sampling sites within the spring area of the Andreas Stream Hydrographic Basin, Vera Cruz County, RS, Brazil, were analyzed quarterly. Similarly, from 2012 and 2014, water samples in these sampling sites were collected for determination of physicochemical and microbiological parameters, such as water temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate, phosphate, total dissolved solids, and fecal coliforms. The results indicated the occurrence of two diatom samples groups with significant differences (p< 0.05). Group 1 (sampling sites P1, P4, and P5) was classified in the oligotrophic category with an average WQTI of 1.3 +/- 0.2, while group 2 (sampling sites P2, P3, P6, and P7) was classified in the beta-mesotrophic category with an average value of 2.0 +/- 0.4).Achnanthidium minutissimumandPlatessa hustedtiithe dominant species were classified as oligotrophic taxa. Thus, we proposed the upper limit of the first interval of the WQTI score scale, equal to 1.5, as a reference value to differentiate the limits between the "high" and "good" ecological status to determine "reference sites" for subtropical and temperate Brazilian aquatic systems. The physical, chemical, and microbiological water quality evaluation gives support to this proposal, as far as the results indicated a significant improvement in the water quality, classifying sampling sites P1, P4, and P5 as having good quality appropriate for multiple uses.						de Souza Celente, Gleison/0000-0002-9314-2782; Heinrich, Carla/0000-0003-2053-8919													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2021	28	7					8698	8708		10.1007/s11356-020-11136-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11136-w		OCT 2020						33068242					WOS:000579452100005

Predicting Streamflow Duration From Crowd-Sourced Flow Observations	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Streamflow duration is important for aquatic ecosystems and assigning stream protection status. This study predicts streamflow duration, represented as the fraction of time with flow each year, using a combination of sensor data and crowd-sourced visual observations for a study area in northern Colorado, USA. We used 11 stream stage sensors and 177 visual monitoring points to examine how frequently streams should be sampled to compute flow fractions accurately. This showed that the number of visual observations needed to compute accurate flow fractions increases with decreasing flow duration. We then developed random forest models to predict mean annual flow fractions using climate, topographic, and land cover predictors and found that snow persistence, summer precipitation, and drainage area were important predictors. Model performance was best when using sites with >= 10 visual observations. Our model predicts that almost all (98%) of streams in the study region are non-perennial, about 10% more than the amount of non-perennial streams in the National Hydrography Dataset. Stream type maps are sensitive to the time period of data collection and to thresholds used to represent perennial versus non-perennial flow. To improve maps of non-perennial streams, we recommend moving beyond categorical classification of streams to a continuous variable like flow fraction. These efforts can be best supported with frequent observations in time that span streams with a wide range of flow fractions and drainage area attributes. Most small streams in the world are not monitored, so we know little about when they are flowing or dry. Yet, the amount of time streams flow can determine whether they are protected by water quality legislation and streamside management plans. In this study we used visual observations of stream flow/no flow and stream sensors to develop a model that predicts the fraction of time that streams flow. At a study area in northern Colorado, volunteer observers documented stream flow/no flow at 177 stream segments, and we placed sensors in 11 headwater streams at different elevations. We found that streams needed to be visited approximately weekly to determine how long they flow each year. Streams that rarely flow needed to be visited more often than those that flow most of the time. Our model shows that most (98%) of the streams in the study area do not flow continuously. The amount of time that streams flow is sensitive to changing climate and water demands. Ongoing monitoring of these streams will help us track and predict the range of flow conditions that are possible throughout the vast networks of small streams that feed larger rivers and lakes.

Then, the temperature-related term of each species was established for a previously developed interspecific competition model, which can not be applied in actual lakes due to the lack of temperature-related terms. Based on experimental results, the highest temperature-dependent growth rate for C. meneghiniana was calculated to be 0.64 day(-1) at 29 degrees C and that for Microcystis sp. was 0.65 day(-1) at 37 degrees C. The coefficient epsilon, which reflects the extent of the biovolume change affected by temperature, was 19.4 for C. meneghiniana and 8.7 for Microcystis sp., indicating that C. meneghiniana is more sensitive to the temperature than Microcystis sp. Moreover, cocultivation experiments at low temperature (20 degrees C) and high temperature (30 degrees C) were conducted to verify the influence of these temperature-dependent growth characteristics on the interspecific interaction. The biovolume in saturation and dominant species were portrayed in the two temperature groups to assess the effect of temperature on their interaction. This study also discussed the effect of temperature on Microcystis blooms formation by comparing experimental results with the observed situation in the field of Lake Tega.

Stocking for rehabilitation of burbot in the Kootenai River, Idaho, USA and British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd International Burbot Symposium	JUL 06, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN					The burbot Lota lota is widespread globally, but the population in the Kootenai River, Idaho and British Columbia, Canada is at risk of extirpation because of habitat changes caused by operation of Libby Dam in Montana, 100 km upstream of the border with Idaho. We developed an age-structured simulation model to estimate the number of age-0 burbot (fall fingerlings) to stock annually to rebuild the population in the Kootenai River. We found with the estimated annual survival of about 38% that 110 000-900 000 age-0 burbot per year will need to be stocked to rebuild the burbot population in the Kootenai River in 25 years, depending on the rehabilitation goal, either 5500 age-4 burbot and older as an interim goal or 17 000 age-4 and older burbot as an ultimate goal (longer than 250 mm). If survival is higher at 61% then the stocking numbers could range from 12 000 to 35 000 age-0 fingerlings per year. After stocked burbot in the population reach age 4, discharge from Libby Dam must be regulated to provide suitable temperatures and flows during the burbot pre-spawning and spawning periods, to enable the population to reproduce and return to self-sustaining status. Our findings will serve as an example for similar efforts to restore depleted burbot populations elsewhere in the world.

Physical processes and hypoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The circulation and exchange processes during summer stratification were examined using time-series data of horizontal velocity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen profiles during 2004 and 2005 in the mid- central basin of Lake Erie. The current and temperature spectra showed a prominent peak at around 18 h, indicating the presence of clockwise rotating inertial waves. The mean bottom currents were strong (>0.1 m s(-1)) and flowed in opposite direction to winds because of the surface pressure gradient due to wind set- up. The general range of horizontal exchange coefficients in the central basin is 0.2 - 1.2 m(2) s(-1). Vertical exchange coefficients varied from 1 3 1025 to 1 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-1). The high values usually occurred in the surface layer because of surface winds. The source of turbulent energy is current shear due to near-inertial oscillations in and above the thermocline and shearing stress due to the effect of mean currents and wave-induced motions during energetic wind events at the lake bottom. During strong wind episodes significant wave-induced currents were observed close to the bottom. The short-term oxygen depletion rates varied considerably between + 0.87 mg L-1 d(-1) and -1.16 mg L-1 d(-1) in 2004 mainly because of physical processes in the central basin. When the hypolimnion depth is sufficiently thick (4 m), short-term changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations were partly due to vertical mixing and partly due to horizontal transport and mixing.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2008	53	5					2007	2020		10.4319/lo.2008.53.5.2007	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.5.2007													WOS:000259356000027

Detailed analyses were made of the tephra, sediment characteristics, pollen and chironomids of a 3 kyr sediment sequence from Helluvaostjorn, a small. shallow lake. The pollen data show a steady decline in the percentage abundance of tree birch (Betula pubescens) pollen between the Norse settlement (landnum, c. AD 870) and c. AD 1300, a pattern that contrasts with the abrupt fall in birch pollen percentages immediately following the Norse colonization at almost all previously studied sites in Iceland. Some lines of evidence suggest that the gradual birch decline could be a result of reworking of soil pollen, but independent evidence suggests that this may not necessarily be the case. The pollen record indicates that birch woodland was replaced by acidophilic taxa (notably Empetrum nigrum and Sphagnum), again contrasting with the more usual pattern of Poaceae expansion seen in post-landnam pollen diagrams from mires close to farm sites. Chironomid and Pediastrum accumulation data show that the limnic environment became more productive immediately after landnam, probably because or anthropogenic disturbance. An increase in sedimentation rate after landnam appears initially to have been caused by increased lake productivity, while reworked inorganic soil materials became a significant contributor to the sediments after c. AD 1200. The data suggest that the impact of settlement on terrestrial vegetation may have been more variable than previously thought, while freshwater ecosystems experienced significant and rapid change.					; Church, Mike/F-6733-2010; Dugmore, Andrew/HSH-4932-2023	Lawson, Ian Thomas/0000-0002-3547-2425; Church, Mike/0000-0001-7908-7812													0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2007	36	1					1	19		10.1080/0300948060082798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0300948060082798													WOS:000244148600001

In this review we summarize the main processes controlling carbonate deposition in extant Iberian lakes located in Mesozoic and Tertiary carbonate-dominated regions and formed through karstic activity during the Late Quaternary. The lakes, relatively small (1 ha to 118 ha) and relatively shallow (Z(ma)x = 11 to 40 m) provide examples of the large variability of sedimentary facies, depositional environments, and carbonate sources. Hydrology is dominated by groundwater inflow except those directly connected to the fluvial drainage. Nine lakes have been selected for this review and the main fades in palustrine, littoral and profundal environments described and interpreted. Clastic carbonates occur in all Iberian lakes due to the carbonate composition of the bedrocks, surface formations and soils of the watersheds. Low temperatures and dilute meteoric waters seem responsible for the low carbonate content of sediments in high elevation lakes in the glaciated terrains in the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains. Clastic carbonates are dominant in small karst lakes with functional inlets where sediment infill is dominated by fining upward sequences deposited during flood events. Re-working of littoral carbonates is common in shallow environments and during low lake level stages. In most lakes, endogenic carbonate production occurs in two settings: i) littoral platforms dominated by Chara and charophyte meadows and ii) epilimnetic zone as biologically-mediated calcite precipitates. Continuous preservation of varves since the Mid-Holocene only occurs in one of the deeper lakes(Montcortes Lake, up to 30 m) where calcite laminae textures (massive, fining upward and coarsening upward) reflect seasonal changes in limnological conditions. However, varves have been formed and preserved in most of the lakes during short periods associated with increased water depth and more frequent meromictic conditions. Most Iberian lakes are in a mature stage and karstic processes are not very active. An outstanding example of a lake with intense karstic activity is Banyoles Lake where increased spring discharge after long rainy periods causes large remobilization and re-suspension of the sediments accumulated in the deepest areas, leading to the deposition of thick homogeneous layers (homogeinites). The Iberian karst lake sequences underline the large variability of facies, carbonate sources, and depositional environments in small lake systems. They illustrate how lake types evolve through the existence of a lake basin at centennial or even smaller time scales. Hydrology is the paramount control on facies and depositional environment patterns distribution and lake evolution and, consequently, a lake classification is proposed based on hydrology and sediment input. A correct interpretation of carbonate sources and depositional history is a key for using lake sequences as archives of past global changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The lake is principally fed from surface flow, ground water recharge from alluvium and thermal discharges located at the bottom of the lake. As indicated by physical and chemical observations, the lake is composed of two hydrochemically distinct water layers. There is a transition zone between these two layers at a depth of approximately 10 m. The bottom layer, which contains more mineralized water, is recognized easily by the smell of hydrogen sulfide gas. A decrease in pH and dissolved oxygen and an increase in specific conductivity and ionic constituents are observed at the transition zone in depth profiles at all measurement sites throughout the year. The isotopic compositions of the representative observation points widely scatter and indicate the mixing of thermal and cold-karstic waters. As indicated by satellite imagery data, the morphology of the lake shores are primarily controlled by structural elements, which are mostly normal faults. Echo-sounding profiles point out that some of the fault lines, along which the lake bottom springs seem to be located, extend through the lake bottom. Current velocity observations also indicate possible sites of thermal ground water discharges located at the lake bottom.

However, the time of ME formation and development is still unclear, which limits the understanding of pedogenic mode of alpine soils on the QTP. In this study, the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating method was used to determine 54 dating samples from 45 MEs on the northeastern QTP (NE-QTP), the deposition rate (DR) and mass deposition rate (MDR) of MEs were calculated based on the OSL sampling depth, OSL age and bulk density (BD). The provenance of ME parent materials was identified by the soil grain-size composition, elemental geochemistry characteristics and bleachability of luminescence signals analysis. The results show: (1) aeolian dust deposition played an important role of ME parent materials; (2) modern ME formed mainly in the Late Holocene (similar to 3 ka) and concentrated during similar to 1.4-0.2 ka. It took average 0.9 ka for a majority thickness of similar to 20 cm ME formation; (3) the average DR of MEs was 0.3 +/- 0.04 mm center dot a(-1), and MDR was 346.3 +/- 45.9 g center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1), which was close to the flux of modern atmospheric fallen dust; (4) the formation of most MEs followed an aeolian dust aggradation mode.

Influence of chemical water composition on spatial distribution of phytoplankton in the Balkhash Lake (Kazakhstan)	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The effect of the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), the absolute content of anions and cations, as well as the ratios of K+/Na+, K+/Ca2+, Mg2+/Ca2+ on the spatial variability of quantitative variables of phytoplankton in the Balkhash Lake was researched in summer 2004. The growing salinity of water from West to East followed by increase in the relative content of potassium, sodium and magnesium was favorable for Cyanobacteria, but it oppressed the abundance of other species, with exception of Bacillariophyta. The influence of K+/Na+, K+/Ca2+, Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios on the abundance and biomass of the divisions of planktonic algae was noted predominantly at the TDS of about 2000-2200 mg dm(-3). Based on the obtained results and literature data, it is assumed that Total Dissolved Solids at the level of 1800-2000 mg dm(-3) is a barrier separating the freshwater and brackish-water fauna and flora for the Balkhash Lake and for other inland water bodies in Kazakhstan. Our results correspond with the main points of the theory of critical salinity by Remane-Khlebovich and with the concept of the relativity and multiplicity of zones of barrier salinities by Aladin.

Total (fumarolic plus diffuse soil) CO2 output from Furnas volcano	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												Furnas volcano, in Sao Miguel island (Azores), being the surface expression of rising hydrothermal steam, is the site of intense carbon dioxide (CO2) release by diffuse degassing and fumaroles. While the diffusive CO2 output has long (since the early 1990s) been characterized by soil CO2 surveys, no information is presently available on the fumarolic CO2 output. Here, we performed (in August 2014) a study in which soil CO2 degassing survey was combined for the first time with the measurement of the fumarolic CO2 flux. The results were achieved by using a GasFinder 2.0 tunable diode laser. Our measurements were performed in two degassing sites at Furnas volcano (Furnas Lake and Furnas Village), with the aim of quantifying the total (fumarolic + soil diffuse) CO2 output. We show that, within the main degassing (fumarolic) areas, the soil CO2 flux contribution (9.2 t day(-1)) represents a minor (similar to 15 %) fraction of the total CO2 output (59 t day(-1)), which is dominated by the fumaroles (similar to 50 t day(-1)). The same fumaroles contribute to similar to 0.25 t day(-1) of H2S, based on a fumarole CO2/H2S ratio of 150 to 353 (measured with a portable Multi-GAS). However, we also find that the soil CO2 contribution from a more distal wider degassing structure dominates the total Furnas volcano CO2 budget, which we evaluate (summing up the CO2 flux contributions for degassing soils, fumarolic emissions and springs) at similar to 1030 t day(-1).

Extensive studies have been carried out to constrain the Holocene lake level fluctuations by dating shorelines with a variety of methods (e.g., luminescence, 14C, 10Be and U-Th series). In comparison, the timing of the lake level variations during the last glacial and subsequent deglaciation periods has been rarely studied. The driving factors of such changes, therefore, remain elusive. In this study, we performed a detailed luminescence dating investigation on six samples taken from a nearshore sedimentary outcrop in the south of Selin Co basin. The post-IR IRSL signals measured at 225 degrees C (pIRIR225) on sand-sized K-feldspar grains demonstrated a generally good behavior and yielded reliable chronologies, while the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signals of quartz showed systematical age underestimation, which was attributed to anomalous fading. Six pIRIR225 ages ranging from 15 to 10 ka suggested that the lake level of Selin Co during the last deglaciation reached up to 40-45 m high above the modern lake level. In view of the regional precipitation and temperature proxy records, we consider that the glacier meltwater supply has likely been the primary contributor to the lake highstands during the last deglaciation.

Jean; Yi, Yi			Quantifying saline groundwater seepage to surface waters in the Athabasca oil sands region	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Western Canadian oil sands contain over 170 billion barrels of proven unconventional petroleum reserves currently extracted at 1.8 million barrels per day by either surface mining, or by in situ techniques that require subsurface injection of steam and hydrocarbon solvents. Natural high-salinity springs are known to add water and entrained inorganic and organic constituents to the Athabasca River and its tributaries in the region of ongoing bitumen production. However, the magnitude and synoptic distribution of these saline inputs has remained unquantified. Here, a chloride mass balance is used to estimate saline groundwater discharge to the Athabasca River from 1987 to 2010. Results show that the highest saline water discharge rate to the Athabasca River occurs between Ft. McMurray and the Peace-Athabasca Delta, supported by subcrop exposure of lower Cretaceous-and Devonian-aged formations bearing saline waters. Further, the input of saline groundwater is found to be an important control on the chemistry of the lower Athabasca River, despite comprising 10 1 to 3% of the Athabasca River's discharge. The flux of natural saline groundwater entering the Athabasca does not appear to have increased or decreased from 1987 to 2010. The origin of seep salinity is interpreted as relict subglacial meltwater that has dissolved Devonian-aged evaporites, supported by saline Na-Cl type waters with low O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1 ratios relative to modern precipitation. The magnitude of groundwater discharge and its impact on the Athabasca River's chemistry in the area of ongoing bitumen development warrants the incorporation of natural groundwater seepages into surface water quality monitoring networks.

The 110-km-long fault segment shows systematic offsets of drainage systems surveyed at three sites along its southern section. The isotopic dating of six paleoclimatic events yields a precise chronology for the onset of six generations of gully incisions at 47.5 ka BP, 37.5 ka BP, 13 ka BP, 9 ka BP, 7 ka BP, and 5 ka BP. Additionally, detailed mapping and reconstructions provide cumulative displacements for 20 dated incisions along the fault trace. The individual amounts of cumulative slip consistently fall into six distinct classes. This yields: i) an average constant slip rate of 4.7 to 5.1 mm/yr for the last 47.5 kyr and ii) a variable slip rate ranging from 3.5 mm/yr to 11 mm/yr over 2-kyr- to 24-kyr-long intervals. Taking into account that the last large earthquake occurred in AD 1033, we infer 3.5 to 5 in of present-day slip deficit which corresponds to a Mw similar to 7.4 earthquake along the Jordan Valley fault segment. The timing of cumulative offsets reveals slip rate variations critical to our understanding of the slip deficit and seismic cycle along major continental faults. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The model was used to simulate daily water temperature profiles and stratification characteristics in summer (June, July, and August -JJA) for Suwa Lake in Japan as a case study. For future assessments, the model uses surface climate variables obtained from a downscaling method that was applied to the UK Hadley Centre's coupled ocean/atmosphere model forced by combined CO2 and sulphate aerosol changes (HadCM2SUL). The downscaling method employed mean sea level surface pressure to derive three airflow indices identified as: the total shear vorticity (Z) -a measure of cyclonicity -, the strength of the resultant flow (F), and the overall flow direction (D). Statistical relationships between these indices and seven daily meteorological time series were formulated to represent climate variable series at sites around Suwa Lake. These relationships were used to downscale the observed climatology of 1979-1995 and that of 2080-2099 using HadCM2SUL outputs. (C) 1998 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Budget Analysis of Escherichia coli at a Southern Lake Michigan Beach	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Escherichia coli(EC) concentrations at two beaches impacted by river plume dynamics in southern Lake Michigan were analyzed using three-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models. The relative importance of various physical and biological processes influencing the fate and transport of EC were examined via budget analysis and a first-order sensitivity analysis of model parameters. The along-shore advective flux of EC(CFU/m(2).s) was found to be higher compared to its cross-shore counterpart; however, the sum of diffusive and advective components was of a comparable magnitude in both directions showing the importance of cross-shore exchange in EC transport. Examination of individual terms in the EC mass balance equation showed that vertical turbulent mixing in the water column dominated the overall EC transport for the summer conditions simulated. Dilution due to advection and diffusion accounted for a large portion of the total EC budget in the nearshore, and the net EC loss rate within the water column (CFU/m(3).s) was an order of magnitude smaller compared to the horizontal and vertical transport rates. This result has important implications for modeling EC at recreational beaches; however, the assessment of the magnitude of EC loss rate is complicated due to the strong coupling between vertical exchange and depth-dependent EC loss processes such as sunlight inactivation and settling. Sensitivity analysis indicated that solar inactivation has the greatest impact on EC loss rates. Although these results are site-specific, they clearly bring out the relative importance of various processes involved.

As the thawing rate of mountain permafrost ice is much lower than for glacier ice, a shift fromglacial to periglacial dynamics is predicted for Alpine landscapes during the 21st century. Despite the growing literature on the impacts of deglaciation on Alpine hydrology and ecosystems, chemical and biological features of waters emerging from Alpine rock glaciers (i.e. permafrost landforms composed by a mixture of ice and debris) have been poorly investigated so far, and knowledge on microbial bio-diversity of headwaters is still sparse. A set of glacier-, rock glacier- and groundwater/precipitation-fed streams was investigated in the Italian Central Alps in late summer 2016, aiming at exploring bacterial community composition and diversity in epilithic and surface sediment biofilm and at verifying the hypothesis that rock glacier-fed headwaters represent peculiar ecosystems from both a chemical and biological point of view. Rock glacier-fed waters showed high values of electrical conductivity and trace elements related to their bedrock lithology, and their highly diverse bacterial assemblages significantly differed from those detected in glacier-fed streams. Bacterial taxonomic composition appeared to be mainly related to water and substrate type, as well as to water chemistry, the latter including concentrations of nutrients and trace metals. The results of this study confirm the chemical and biological peculiarity of rock glacier-fed waters compared to glacial waters, and suggest a potential driving role of thawing permafrost in modulating future ecological traits of Alpine headwaters within the context of progressing deglaciation.

Pore water nutrient profiles, nutrient fluxes, sediment denitrification and O(2) consumption as well as NH(4)(+) excretion of M. affinis were followed for 7 days. After the algal enrichment, the NO(3)(-) concentration fell to near zero in the pore water and a decrease in the denitrification rate was observed. This occurred since the concentration of NO(3)(-) in the flow-through water was low and coupled nitrification-denitrification formed the main denitrification pathway. The share of denitrification compared to other loss processes of N from the sediment reduced from 37% in the control cores to 0.7% in the algae treated cores. The efflux of NH(4)(+) from the sediment formed 99% of the total loss of N in the algae treated cores. A massive efflux of NH(4)(+) and PO(4)(3-) was observed after the algal enrichment. The amphipods did not increase denitrification.						Lehtonen, Kari Kullervo/0000-0002-7757-2336													1239-6095					SEP 29	2003	8	3					229	243																WOS:000221372500004
J	Nkhoma, B; Kayira, G				Nkhoma, Bryson; Kayira, Gift			Gender and power contestations over water use in irrigation schemes: Lessons from the lake Chilwa basin	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Over the past two decades, Malawi has been adversely hit by climatic variability and changes, and irrigation schemes which rely mostly on water from rivers have been negatively affected. In the face of dwindling quantities of water, distribution and sharing of water for irrigation has been a source of contestations and conflicts. Women who constitute a significant section of irrigation farmers in schemes have been major culprits. The study seeks to analyze gender contestations and conflicts over the use of water in the schemes developed in the Lake Chilwa basin, in southern Malawi. Using oral and written sources as well as drawing evidence from participatory and field observations conducted at Likangala and Domasi irrigation schemes, the largest schemes in the basin, the study observes that women are not passive victims of male domination over the use of dwindling waters for irrigation farming. They have often used existing political and traditional structures developed in the management of water in the schemes to competitively gain monopoly over water.

Five bedsets of flood slackwater deposits (SWD) were found interbedded into Holocene aeolian loess-soil profiles in the river bank at the Longmenxia site. They were identified as the deposits of the suspended sediment load during the extreme flood events of the Holocene. The minimum flood peak discharges were estimated to be 12,300-15,300 m(3)/s using the slope-area method. These are about twice the largest gauged record (7180 m(3)/s) that has occurred since 1937. These flood events occurred at 3100-3000 a B.P., 1800-1700 a B.P., 700-550 a B.P. and 350-250 a B.P., as dated by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) in combination with stratigraphic correlation, to which may be added the recorded events of the 223 and 1761 CE floods. These were associated with Holocene monsoonal shifts and abrupt climatic events. This research not only provides palaeoflood discharge estimates on the middle Yihe River, but also provides important data for understanding interactions between regional hydro-climatic systems and global climate change in humid and semi-humid monsoonal regions, such as China.

J	Ma, WX; Huang, TL; Li, X				Ma, Wei-Xing; Huang, Ting-Lin; Li, Xuan			Study of the application of the water-lifting aerators to improve the water quality of a stratified, eutrophicated reservoir	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacterial blooms accompanied by a release of nutrients from the bottom sediments in the stratified summer period continue to be a serious nuisance to water quality managers. Water-lifting and aeration technology can be used to inhibit algal growth while controlling internal pollutants. In this study, two water-lifting aerators (WLAs) were installed in a stratified, eutrophicated reservoir to investigate its ability to improve the water quality. The results showed that the lower water layer was directly oxygenated by WLAs. After the WLAs operated for a month, the concentration of dissolved oxygen at the bottom increased from 0 mg/L to 5 mg/L; the release of internal pollutants had effectively been suppressed. The advection generated by the circulated flow from WLAs can transport algae from the surface layer to the bottom layer. The mixing function of WLAs can control algal growth, and its mixed conduction speed gradient can effectively resist cyanobacteria floatation and reduce the competitive advantage of harmful algae, which changes the quantity and structure of the phytoplankton community. The algal cell density decreased to less than 10 million/L, with cyanobacteria accounting for only 16% of the population in the area of 10 m away from the WLA. The quantity of algae reached to 100 million/L and included Microcystis, which accounted for 91% of the population in the area of 100 m away from the WLA after three weeks of operation. The results can provide direct technical support for reservoir restoration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kaushal, SS; Lewis, WM Jr; McCutchan, JH Jr				Kaushal, SS; Lewis, WM Jr; McCutchan, JH Jr			Land use change and nitrogen enrichment of a Rocky Mountain watershed	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Headwater ecosystems may have a limited threshold for retaining and removing nutrients delivered by certain types of land use. Nitrogen enrichment was studied in a Rocky Mountain watershed undergoing rapid expansion of population and residential development. Study sites were located along a 30-km transect from the headwaters of the Blue River to Lake Dillon, a major source of drinking water for Denver, Colorado. Ground water in residential areas with septic systems showed high concentrations of nitrate-N (4.96 +/- 1.22 mg/L, mean +/- SE), and approximately 40% of wells contained nitrate with delta N-15 values in the range of wastewater. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in tributaries with residential development peaked during spring snowmelt as concentrations of DIN declined to below detection limits in undeveloped tributaries. Annual export of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was considerably lower in residential streams, suggesting a change in forms of N with development. The seasonal delta N-15 of algae in residential streams was intermedia e between baseline values from undeveloped streams and stream algae grown on wastewater. Between 19% and 23% of the annual N export from developed tributaries was derived from septic systems, as estimated from the delta N-15 of algae. This range was similar to the amount of N export above background determined independently from mass-balance estimates. From a watershed perspective, total loading of N to the Blue River catchment from septic and municipal wastewater (2 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) is currently less than the amount from background atmospheric sources (3 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Nonetheless, nitrate-N concentrations exceeded limits for safe drinking water in some groundwater wells (10 mg/L), residential streams showed elevated seasonal patterns of nitrate-N concentration and ratios of DIN to total dissolved phosphorus, and seasonal minimum concentrations of nitrate-N in Lake Dillon have increased exponentially to 80 mu g/L over the last decade from an initial value near zero. Results suggest that isotopic ratios in autotrophs can be used to detect and quantify increases in N enrichment associated with land use change. The biotic capacity of headwater ecosystems to assimilate increases in inorganic N from residential development may be insufficient to prevent nitrogen enrichment over considerable distances and multiple aquatic ecosystems downstream.					; Kaushal, Sujay/G-1062-2013	MCCUTCHAN, JAMES/0000-0003-1409-4514; 													1051-0761	1939-5582				FEB	2006	16	1					299	312		10.1890/05-0134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-0134								16705981					WOS:000236510100027

We assessed the impact of the flood regime on the assimilation of atrophic subsidy produced in the floodplain of a large fluvial lake, Lake Saint-Pierre (Quebec, Canada) on five invertivore littoral fish species (yellow perch (Perca flavescens), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bridle shiner (Notropis bifrenatus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), and banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus)). We hypothesized that the incorporation of floodplain-derived carbon into fish biomass and individual fitness would increase in years with higher magnitude and longer duration floods. Studying four consecutive years with contrasting spring-flood events, we used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate floodplain contribution, and linear mixed models to analyze the impact of hydrology on floodplain contribution and fish body condition. Floodplain and main river's invertebrates exhibited statistically distinct isotopic ratios (t test: p value < 0.001). Floodplain contribution and body condition were positively correlated with flooding intensity and duration for all species. Body condition was positively correlated with the assimilation of floodplain-subsidy for golden shiner and banded killifish. Our study identified flooding intensity as a main driver influencing the assimilation of floodplain-derived carbon by littoral fish and their fitness in a large river ecosystem.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2021	78	12					1782	1792		10.1139/cjfas-2020-0395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-0395													WOS:000722147300003
J	Chang, YF				Chang, Yufen			Spatializing Enlightened Civilization in the Era of Translating Vernacular Modernity: Colonial Vietnamese Intellectuals' Adventure Tales and Travelogues, 1910s-1920s	JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES												This article examines the strategy of literary spatialization employed by colonial subjects to imaginatively engage with colonial civilizing projects. It analyzes twelve adventure stories written between the 1910s and 1920s by colonial Vietnamese reformed scholars, whose lives were impacted by the pan-Asian reform movements that swept Japan, China, and Vietnam between the 1860s and 1900s. They reflected their experiences with Enlightened civilization as they were pushing for vernacularization and modernization through translating the Chinese transculturation of Japanese texts into Latin-based qu (o) over barc ng (u) over bar script while constructing a national literature. Adventure tales and travelogues were considered suitable for aspiring writers to translatively imitate Western literature as presented in Chinese translation of Japanese texts. The authors negotiated with the French version of Enlightened Civilization by employing two East Asian literary tropes: the dangerous but exciting Rivers-and-Lakes World, where the protagonist ventures to search for van minh, and the peaceful and other-worldly Peach Blossom Spring utopia, where the true qualities of van minh are realized. These stories reveal colonial subjects' admiration for and anxiety regarding the French mission civilisatrice, and their literary efforts to imagine a Vietnamese van minh that would both impress and surpass the original models.																			0021-9118	1752-0401				AUG	2017	76	3					627	654		10.1017/S0021911817000481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021911817000481													WOS:000410244500004

Assessing internal phosphorus load - Problems to be solved. Lake Reserv. Manage. 25:419-432. Internal loading as phosphorus (P) released from anoxic sediment surfaces often represents the main summer P load to lakes and reservoirs and can have an immense effect on their water quality. Many difficulties in internal load assessment exist, however, including ignoring internal load altogether, ambiguity about the origin of sediment released P and inexact definitions. Most of these problems are due to the difficulty in distinguishing internal from external P sources, which is particularly challenging in polymictic lakes. To prevent misconceptions and facilitate its evaluation, internal load in stratified and polymictic lakes should be expressed in a similar way to external loads: as annual, gross and areal load of total phosphorus (TP). Possible approaches to internal load quantification are: in situ determination from hypolimnetic P increases, mass balance approaches, and estimates from anoxic active area and P release. Further suggestions to facilitate the study of internal loading include: (a) the differentiation between polymictic and stratified lakes, sections of lakes, and time periods when evaluating indicators and impact of internal load; (b) the separation of internal load (upward flux) from sedimentation (downward flux) of external and internal loads, and (c) the consideration of the downward flux of both external (L-ext, mg/m(2)/yr) and internal (L-int, mg/m(2)/yr) loads by a retention model (R-sed) when predicting lake TP averages in a mass balance model of the form (q(s) = annual areal water load in m/yr): TP = L-ext + L-int/q(s) x (1 - R-sed)					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													1040-2381	2151-5530					2009	25	4					419	432		10.1080/00357520903458848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00357520903458848													WOS:000280285100008
J	Syverson, KM				Syverson, KM			Sediment record of short-lived ice-contact lakes, Burroughs Glacier, Alaska	BOREAS												Sediments deposited in two small ice-contact lakes with low rates of sediment input have been studied in subaerial exposures. Sediment characteristics are a function of the water sourer (glacial meltwater versus non-meltwater), proximity to the glacier margin and lake shore, amount of supraglacial debris, and lake duration. Calving Lake expanded (and later partially drained) as a calving ice margin retreated. Nearshore deltas contain 1 x 10(5) m(3) stratified sand and gravel deposited at rates up to m/yr during a 9-yr interval. Deltaic sediment contains types A and B ripple-drift cross-lamination, draped lamination, and scour surfaces caused by variations in water-flow velocity and the amount of sediment settling from suspension. Must water inflow came From non-subglacial meltwater sources and was sediment-poor, so overflow and interflow sedimentation processes dominated the offshore environment. Offshore sediment generally contains massive sill or silt interbedded with fine-grained sand deposited at rates of 1.3-1.5 cm/yr. Iceberg gravity craters observed on the lake plain were formed when icebergs impacted the lake Boor during calving events. In Bruce Hills Lake, proximity to glacier ice and the presence of supraglacial sediment formed coarsening-upward successions when debris Fell directly from an ice ledge onto silty lacustrine sediment.																			0300-9483					MAR	1998	27	1					44	54																WOS:000073443500004

In this study, the annual spatiotemporal variations in lake-land breezes at a small urban lake were investigated, including their impacts on heat and moisture dynamics of lakefront trees. From 2022 to 2023, we conducted field experiments via automatic weather stations arranged at different distances from the lake, which continuously recorded the air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. Data analysis involved identifying and quantifying lake-land breezes. The findings revealed the longest lake breeze duration of 21.25 h and the lowest land breeze intensity of 0.11 m/s in summer. Lake breezes yielded a maximum cooling effect of 0.50 degrees C in the afternoon when the wind speed exceeded 0.5 m/s. Additionally, lake breezes enhanced moisture diffusion, reducing the lakefront humidity by 0.2 g/m3 but weak land breezes increased humidity. Hydrometeorology-related parameters like solar radiation significantly influenced lake-land breezes. In this research, urban planning strategies for blue-green spaces were provided to maximize cooling benefits during peak hot periods, thereby leveraging lake breezes to reduce heat stress. By considering lake-land breezes, cities can increase their thermal comfort and resilience to heatwaves.

J	Haberyan, KA				Haberyan, Kurt A.			A &gt;22,000 yr diatom record from the plateau of Zambia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Diatoms and sediments were examined in a 530 cm core from Ishiba Ngandu, Zambia, a lake formed by gentle downwarping. Diatom zone D (>20 cal ka BP) was mostly sand with abundant Aulacoseira and Eunotia, suggesting a shallow lake perhaps kept fresh by spring inputs and lake discharge, except during deposition of the lowermost 66 cm. Gyttja deposition between about 22 and 20 cal ka BP suggested a deeper lake and a wetter climate, perhaps because the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) was farther southeast relative to modern times. The next zone, zone C (about 20-19 cal ka BP), was sand with abundant Achnanthidium and Eunotia but very few planktonic diatoms, apparently representing very shallow water and an arid period without the CAB. The gyttja and diatoms in zone B (19-4 ka) suggested an increase in moisture when the CAB returned. Zone A (4-0 cal ka BP) was dominated by the planktonic Aulacoseira (>89%), suggesting an increase in wind-driven mixing. Uniquely, Ishiba Ngandu likely has been relatively moist since the last glacial maximum, matching pre-Holocene wetness in Botswana but not its Holocene aridity; evidently the climate here had switched to that of East Africa.

Agricultural intensification leads to higher nitrate levels in Lake Ontario tributaries	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Eutrophication remains the most widespread water quality impairment globally and is commonly associated with excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs to surface waters from agricultural runoff. In southern Ontario, Canada, increases in nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations as well as declines in total phosphorus (TP) concentration have been observed over the past four decades at predominantly agricultural watersheds, where major expansions in row crop production at the expense of pasture and forage have occurred. This study used a space-for-time approach to test whether 'agricultural intensification', herein defined as increases in row crop area (primarily corn-soybean-winter wheat rotation) at the expense of mixed livestock and forage/pasture, could explain increases in NO3-N and declines in TP over time. We found a clear, positive relationship between the extent of row crop area within watersheds and NO3-N losses, such that tributary NO3-N concentrations and export were predicted to increase by ~0.4 mg/L and ~30 kg/km(2) respectively, for every 10% expansion in row crop area. There was also a significant positive relationship between row crop area and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration, but not export, and TP was not correlated with any form of landcover. Instead, TP was strongly associated with storm events, and was more sensitive to hydrologic condition than to landcover. These results suggest that pervasive shifts toward tile-drained corn and soybean production could explain increases in tributary NO3-N levels in this region. The relationship between changes in agriculture and P is less clear, but the significant association between dissolved P and row crop area suggests that increased adoption of reduced tillage practices and tile drainage may enhance subsurface losses of P.

Effects of road-salt application on Cladocera assemblages in shallow Precambrian Shield lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Road-salt application is an integral part of winter road maintenance and safety in many cold regions. However, chloride (Cl-) runoff from salting activities may have adverse ecological effects. Lakes affected by road salt, particularly in urban areas, may have Cl(-)concentrations up to 300% higher than natural conditions. Zooplankton are sensitive to changes in water chemistry; however, little research has been conducted thus far into the biological effects of elevated Cl(-)concentrations from road-salt runoff. Using paleolimnological analyses, we studied the long-term effects of Cl(-)from road salt runoff on shallow, soft-water lakes within the southern Canadian Shield. Specifically, we examined Cladocera subfossils in dated sediment cores from 6 lakes within the Muskoka River Watershed of south-central Ontario, Canada. We compared long-term changes in cladoceran assemblages in the 5 lakes with the highest regional Cl(-)concentrations (32.8-90.9 mg/L) with a reference lake (0.91 mg/L). Prior to salting (ca. 1950), all of the lakes were dominated byBosminaspp., and cladoceran assemblages showed little variation over time. After salting began, species assemblages in the 5 impacted lakes showed distinct taxonomic shifts, including increases in relative abundances ofChydorus brevilabris(Frey,1980),Eurycercusspp., and theDaphnia pulexcomplex, and decreases in the relative abundance ofBosminaspp. andAlonaspp. In 2 of the lakes, these changes were distinct and coincided with the onset of salting activities. In contrast to the species changes observed in the affected lakes, we recorded minimal directional changes in cladoceran assemblages in the nearby reference site. Overall, biological changes in the impacted lakes were best explained by changing Cl(-)concentrations associated with road-salt application. Among lakes, the severity of impact may have been indirectly mediated by differences in food quantity through its effect on Cl(-)toxicity.

J	Quemerais, B; Lum, KR				Quemerais, B; Lum, KR			Distribution and temporal variation of cadmium in the St. Lawrence River basin	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Samples of raw water were collected at regular intevals at two transects in the St. Lawremce River and four of its tributaries from March to November 1991 and from April to June 1992. Water samples were analyzed for both the dissolved and the particulate phase for cadmium (Cd), organic carbon, iron and manganese. Mean dissolved Cd concentration was 10 +/- 5 ng/L and no spatial variability was observed. Higher concentrations were found during high flow periods, suggesting an uptake of cadmium by phytoplankton during summer. In addition, dissolved cadmium did not appear to be associated with either DOC, dissolved Fe or dissolved Mn. The mean particulate Cd concentration was 1.3 +/- 1.1 mu g/g, with almost all stations presenting the same concentration except the Yamaska River, which had a concentration of 0.5 +/- 0.2 mu g/g. Particulate Cd showed a negative correlation with suspended particulate matter and a positive correlation with particulate organic carbon and particulare manganese. Fifty-nine percent of the cadmium was found to be in the particulate phase. Partition coefficients for cadmium (Kd), organic carbon (Kc), iron (KdFe) and manganese (KdMn) were calculated for each sample. Log Kd varied from 3.9 to 5.9, with an average of 5.0 +/- 0.4. Log Kd decreased with increasing particulate matter as did Log Kc and Log KdMn. No significant correlation was found between Log Kd and Log Kc, suggesting that the distribution of cadmium between the dissolved and the particulate phase is not influenced by the distribution of organic carbon. In contrast, positive correlations were observed between Log Kd, Log KdFe and Log KdMn. Cadmium distribution appears to be influenced by Fe and Mn distribution.

J	MEADE, R; WHEELER, BD				MEADE, R; WHEELER, BD			ILLTYD POOLS, BRECON - DESCRIPTION AND CONSERVATION	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The Mires Research Group of the British Ecological Society examined Traeth Mawr and Traeth Bach, two closely-adjoining mires near Brecon, Wales, in September 1984. Both occupy former lake basins with late-glacial deposits overlain with fen peat. At Traeth Bach, this continues to the surface but, a Traeth Mawr, it is overlain by ombrotrophic peat with Sphagnum. The absence of this deposit from Traeth Bach may reflect differences in successional infilling or its removal by peat excavation (for which there is some evidence in both basins). It almost certainly does not reflect major differences in chemical conditions in the two basins as both contain base-rich water (at least at depth). Such water (derived from springs and seepages) irrigates part of the margin of Traeth Mawr forming a base-rich partial lagg and permits and unusual juxtaposition of plant species and vegetation types. Parts of the ombrotrophic surface are badly gullied and, perhaps in response to this, in places the surface is rather dry and degraded (with some trees). Moreover, marginal base-rich water can now penetrate into the ombrotrophic area along the eroded gullies, leading to further changes in its floristic character. A plan for management is proposed.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				MAY	1990	115	1					187	199		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00937.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1990.tb00937.x													WOS:A1990DG53000024
J	Sharpe, DR; Russell, HAJ				Sharpe, David R.; Russell, Hazen A. J.			Sedimentary architecture and glacial hydrodynamic significance of the stratified Oak Ridges Moraine, southern Ontario, Canada	BOREAS												High-quality subsurface data provide new insights into the formation of Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), an similar to 80 km(3) sequence of stratified meltwater deposits resting >200 m above adjacent Lake Ontario. The ORM sedimentary succession comprises a three-part regional architecture: (i) similar to north-south channel sand-gravel; (ii) channel-capping rhythmites; and (iii) east-west ridge sediments. The ORM depositional sequence overlies a regional unconformity with a cross-cutting channel network resulting from similar to north-south meltwater floods that transitioned progressively (falling stage) from a similar to NNE to ENE flow direction (parallels Lake Ontario depression). Seismic profiles delineate the channels and channel fill characteristics of bank-to-bank channel sedimentation of thick gradational gravel-sand-mud sequences. Channel-capping mud (similar to 100-236 rhythmites) within multiple channels beneath the ORM landform mark a widespread interval of low-energy, seasonally controlled subglacial pond deposition. During this quiescent period ice-sheet thickness adjusted to flood-induced stretching/thinning and re-profiled slopes. New ice gradients led to east-west flow and deposition of the overlying third element, a sequence of high-energy confined esker-fan sediments along ORM ridge. Close, sequential timing (similar to 329 varve years) of channel, basin and ridge-forming architectural elements supports naming this assemblage the ORM formation. Proposed ORM floods are analogous to Icelandic jokulhlaups based on the size, geometry and sedimentology. The observed rhythmite interval between flood events represents a short period (similar to 236 years) of regional meltwater storage prior to east-west ORM flooding. The ORM channel and overlying esker-fan sediment ridge represent two closely timed meltwater drainage events rather than formation by coalescing ice streams. The scale and timing of the ORM flood events are linked to rapid sea-level rise, similar to 13.5 ka BP. This high-resolution ORM sedimentological record may provide insights into depositional and glaciogenic controls of other large, stratified moraines. The ORM data indicate deposition in response to hydrodynamic events (outbreak floods, re-profiled ice) rather than direct climate forcing.

Transgressive-phase barriers as indicators of basin-wide lake-level changes in late Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, Utah, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Lake Bonneville was the largest of the late Pleistocene pluvial lakes that once filled part of the Great Basin of the interior westem United States. As the lake reached its highest level at the Bonneville shoreline and overflowed, it eroded through landslide deposits and alluvium near Red Rock Pass, Idaho, and quickly dropped over 100 m to the Provo shoreline. This unique flooding history and resulting rapid lake-level fall allows us to assume that all shorelines with elevations between the Bonneville and Provo levels (the intermediate shorelines) formed during the lake's transgressive phase. Various types of depositional features characterize the transgressive phase shorelines, including barrier spits and bayhead barriers. This study uses 5 m auto-correlated digital elevation models (DEMs), airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), and ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys to measure the internal and external structure of intermediate barriers. Analysis of 102 barriers at 26 different locations further documents the lake's constructional shorelines while employing a statistical approach to show patterns in basin-wide lake levels. These methods identify only one confidently correlatable intermediate shoreline at an adjusted elevation of 1530 m (+/- 4 m), providing evidence of a still-water level during the late-transgressive phase of Lake Bonneville. The variability of elevations along barrier crests indicates that the formation of depositional features is highly dependent on local wave climate, in addition to basin-scale climatic controls.

DEVELOPMENT OF A STOCHASTIC WATER TEMPERATURE MODEL AND PROJECTION OF FUTURE WATER TEMPERATURE AND EXTREME EVENTS IN THE OUELLE RIVER BASIN IN QUEBEC, CANADA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												A stochastic model is proposed to reproduce daily water temperature at 18 observation sites (11 main stem and 7 tributary sites) in the Ouelle River basin located in southern Quebec, Canada, using meteorological variables as predictors. A random sampling procedure without replacement was adopted for the model calibration and validation to overcome the limited length of the observed water temperature series. The predicted water temperature series were then submitted to variance inflation to reproduce the observed variability of the water temperature series. Historical water temperature series were obtained from observed meteorological predictors, whereas reference and future water temperature series were obtained from stochastic water temperature model using five reference (1970-1999) and future (2046-2065) meteorological predictors simulated by five different climate model runs. The reference series reproduced summer mean water temperature and the number of consecutive days with water temperature higher than 21 degrees C or 25 degrees C fairly well. On the basis of the historical series, it can be assumed that the seven tributaries of the Ouelle River provided thermal refugia for native salmon between 1970 and 1999. Future water temperature series projected by the stochastic model show that the seven tributaries could still be used as refugia to prevent lethal stress, whereas the temperature in the main stem and in three tributaries will be high enough to constitute stressful conditions for feeding juvenile Atlantic salmon.

J	Dahl, SO; Bakke, J; Lie, O; Nesje, A				Dahl, SO; Bakke, J; Lie, O; Nesje, A			Reconstruction of former glacier equilibrium-line altitudes based on proglacial sites: an evaluation of approaches and selection of sites	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Various approaches are used to record variations in glacier activity and equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) based on proglacial sites (lacustrine and terrestrial). These approaches are based on a conceptual model of glacier-meltwater induced sedimentation in which the minerogenic (nonorganic) component of the sediments is related to the occurrence of a glacier in the catchment. The principal coupling to former glacier activity and ELAs is common for these approaches. However, different methods and techniques may complement each other, and both possibilities and limitations are demonstrated. Site selection for reconstructing variations in glacier activity/ELAs is evaluated and critical factors are discussed. Rerouting of glacier meltwater streams across local watersheds in combination with proglacial sites gives a distinct on/off signal for former glacier activity/ELAs. Together with representative lateral moraines of known age, local watersheds are important for calibrating reconstructed glacier activity/ELAs based on a chain of proglacial lakes. Based on the 'modern analogue principle', various proxies can record whenever glaciers existed in a catchment. In a chain of proglacial lakes with different sensitivity to record variations in glacier activity/ELAs, these proxies can be calibrated against independent records. For one-site approaches, however, variations in glacier activity/ELAs depend on the interpretation and sensitivity of the proxies used. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It occurred as a component of a microbial mat consisting primarily of Phormidium frigidum Fritsch. Lyngbya martensiana Menegh. and pennate diatoms. Contrastingly, B. cf. algens was not found in Lakes Bonney, Hoare, Chad and Fryxell located in adjacent Taylor Valley, nor was it found in any ice-free littoral regions of the lakes of Taylor and Wright Valleys investigated during the 1980-1981 austral summer. B. algens is the most widespread bryophyte south of 56.degree.S in Antarctica. Its wide range of morphological forms has caused many problems in its taxonomy. Based upon examinations it is probable that B. korotkevicziae Sav.-Lyub. et Z. Smirn. and its variety hollebachii Sav.-Lyub. et Z. Smirn. and an unidentified aquatic Bryum sp. from Ablation Valley, Antarctica, may be ecotypes of B. algens. The findings of B. cf.

J	BINDLOSS, ME				BINDLOSS, ME			LIGHT CLIMATE OF LOCH LEVEN, A SHALLOW SCOTTISH LAKE, IN RELATION TO PRIMARY PRODUCTION BY PHYTOPLANKTON	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Seasonal changes in incident irradiance and underwater light penetration at Loch Leven [United Kingdom] from 1968-1971 are discussed in relation to the photosynthetic behavior and crop density of phytoplankton. Light extinction was highest in the blue and lowest in the orange spectral regions. Underwater light extinction depended chiefly on phytoplankton crop density (estimated as chlorophyll a). Possible causes of variability in the relationship between the minimum vertical extinction coefficient (kmin) and the concentration of chlorophyll a (chl a) are discussed. The value of ks, the increment in kmin per unit increment in algal concentration, was estimated from field data. The ks values imply theoretical upper limits for the amount of chlorophyll a in the euphotic zone (.SIGMA.nmax) of 430 and 468 mg chl a/m2, respectively. Observed euphotic chlorophyll a contents (.SIGMA.n) were sometimes close to these upper limits. Typical photosynthesis/depth profiles are described. Profile area is related to the logarithm of the ratio between surface-penetrating irradiance (I0'') and the irradiance (Ik) defining the onset of light-saturation of photosynthesis. Standardized profiles, plotted on a common scale of optical depth are used to illustrate the relatively minor influence of variations in I0'' and Ik on hourly rates of photosynthesis per unit area. The saturation parameter (Ik) generally increased as photosynthetic capacity (Pmax) increased; the temperature-dependence of Ik is explained by the temperature-dependence of the enzyme-controlled (dark) reactions of photosynthesis, which control Pmax. A spring peak in the ratio between surface penetrating irradiance (I0'') and Ik is interpreted as a result of a lag in the seasonal increase in water temperature with increase in surface irradiance. The gradient (K'') of the linear light-limited region of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve showed little variation. Interactions between mixed depth, underwater light extinction and phytoplankton productivity are discussed; comparisons are made with other shallow, optically deep lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	6					501	518		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01642.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01642.x													WOS:A1976CR59400004
J	Taurozzi, D; Cesarini, G; Scalici, M				Taurozzi, Davide; Cesarini, Giulia; Scalici, Massimiliano			Diatoms as bioindicators for health assessments of ephemeral freshwater ecosystems: A comprehensive review	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Ephemeral waters (EW) are sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems that, although the numerous ecosystem services provided, are poorly investigated and properly managed. Diatoms represent an important biological model largely used in aquatic permanent habitats but underused in ephemeral waters. The aim of this review is to address the knowledge gap, examining the current state of knowledge regarding the health of EW, with a focus on diatoms as bioindicators, specially (i) presenting research trends on EW ecosystem types investigated (ii) analysing the methodological approach, (iii) providing the influence of abiotic factors on the diatom assemblages in EW. A bibliographic search yielded a total of 512 papers. After removing duplicate records, 118 were eliminated. The screening of abstracts resulted in the selection of 48 articles on diatoms and EW since 1982. To avoid discrepancy between terminology we decided to classify the EW found in 3 different categories: Intermittent Running Waters (IRW: rivers, streams, creek, springs), Temporary Large Wetlands (TLW: wetlands, lakes, lagoons) and Temporary Small Waters (TSW: ponds, pools, ventaroles, ditches, thermal waters, troughs, pans). Studies are reported in all continents including Antarctic. IRW are the most investigated ecosystem (n = 683), followed by TSW (239) and TLW (96). Furthermore, studies were mainly conducted on sites located below 1000 m a.s.l. of altitude (n = 27). Studies mainly focus on epilithic diatoms (52 %). Electrical conductivity (80 %), pH (77 %) and water temperature (75 %) are the principal physical-chemical parameters considered. Moreover, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, nitrate and nitrite resulted the best diatom community drivers. Future research is encouraged (1) to achieve a standardised protocol for monitoring EW using diatoms, (2) to focus on conservation projects for high-altitude temporary waters, and (3) to investigate the main driving forces influencing diatom diversity on EW.

J	Geilhausen, M; Morche, D; Otto, JC; Schrott, L				Geilhausen, Martin; Morche, David; Otto, Jan-Christoph; Schrott, Lothar			Sediment discharge from the proglacial zone of a retreating Alpine glacier	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												It is generally assumed that climate change and accelerated glacier melt lead to an increase in suspended sediment discharge from proglacial zones. This study demonstrates that the connectivity between glacial sediment production and downstream sediment fluxes during deglacierization is significantly reduced by the development of proglacial lakes. Suspended and solute sediment fluxes from the proglacial zone of the retreating Obersulzbachkees glacier, Hohe Tauern, Austria, were quantified within a 20 months monitoring period from January 1st 2010 to September 28th 2011. The landsystem is influenced by a proglacial lake (similar to 95 x 10(3) m(2) and >2 x 10(6) m(3)) that hampers sediment output from similar to 18.7 km(2) of the study area. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and solute concentrations (SO C) measured downstream of the proglacial lake were in the range of 71.3 to 702.3 mg/l (empty set SSC <200 mg/l) and 3.58 to 8.33 mg/l (empty set 0 5.56 mg/l) respectively and both are considered to be low. It could be shown by systematic up- and downstream sampling that the proglacial lake reduced SSCs by 88-95 %. However, the lake prevented considerable decrease of SSCs at very low discharge and temporally extended the delivery of higher SSCs when the lake's suspended sediment budget was elevated by external forcing (e.g. rain fall induced hillslope sediment supply). In these situations the lake changed from a sink to a temporal source. It is assumed that bed load was negligible for the duration of this study because the present day bed load transport system is interrupted and supply limited. A total sediment discharge of 18170 +/- 194 t to 18399 +/- 212 t was calculated depending on the calculation method used. Suspended load accounted for 98% and similar to 77 % of the solute load probably originated from chemical weathering. Temporally, the majority of sediment was exported in the ablation seasons (94% SSL and 88% SOL). The overall mass exported corresponds to an average annual specific sediment yield in the range of 451 +/- 5 t/km(2)/a to 457 +/- 5 t/km(2)/a. The results indicate that the Obersulzbachkees proglacial zone is a supply limited system with respect to both bed load and suspended sediment load. It is expected that the number of proglacial lakes will rise within the Alps following accelerated glacial retreat. Hence, sediment delivery from glacial valleys will most likely be significantly altered in the near future, leading to changes in sediment flux of Alpine streams with impacts on hydrology, river ecology and reservoir management.

Suitability of passive sampling for the monitoring of pharmaceuticals in Finnish surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The occurrence of five pharmaceuticals, consisting of four anti-inflammatory and one antiepileptic drug, was studied by passive sampling and grab sampling in northern Lake Paijanne and River Vantaa. The passive sampling was performed by using Chemcatcher (R) sampler with a SDB-RPS Empore disk as a receiving phase. In Lake Paijanne, the sampling was conducted during summer 2013 at four locations near the discharge point of a wastewater treatment plant and in the years 2013 and 2015 at four locations along River Vantaa. The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The concentrations of carbamazepine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in Lake Paijanne determined by passive sampling ranged between 1.4-2.9 ng L-1, 15-35 ng L-1, 13-31 ng L-1, 16-27 ng L-1, and 3.3-32 ng L-1, respectively. Similarly, the results in River Vantaa ranged between 1.2-40 ng L-1, 15-65 ng L-1, 13-33 ng L-1, 16-31 ng L-1, and 3.3-6.4 ng L-1. The results suggest that the Chemcatcher passive samplers are suitable for detecting pharmaceuticals in lake and river waters.					; Lindholm-Lehto, Petra/P-8112-2019	Ahkola, Heidi/0000-0002-3329-3749; Lindholm-Lehto, Petra/0000-0003-1807-8116													0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2016	23	18					18043	18054		10.1007/s11356-016-6778-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6778-y								27255325					WOS:000384435800015
J	Shelef, E; Oskin, M				Shelef, Eitan; Oskin, Michael			Deformation processes adjacent to active faults: Examples from eastern California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Major seismogenic faults are embedded within narrow zones of inelastic off-fault deformation (OFD), where both distributed displacement and modification of rock properties occur. Active distributed displacement may affect slip rate estimates, seismic energy radiation and geodynamic models. This study addresses the role of OFD in the displacement history and mechanical behavior of seismogenic faults, by multisite study of deformed geologic features adjacent to 30-60 km long active strike-slip faults of <10 km of dextral displacement in the Mojave Desert, eastern California. We find that distributed displacement accommodates 0 to similar to 25% of the total displacement over zones of one to two kilometers width. Displacement occurs mostly within 100-200 m of faults and decreases nonlinearly away from the main fault. We show evidence for distributed displacement through simple shear in the form of parallel secondary faults and progressive deformation of linear markers adjacent to the Calico fault. We also find evidence for shear via rotation and progressive fragmentation adjacent to the Harper Lake fault. Analysis of block dimensions show that blocks tend to decrease in size toward faults and that cumulative length of secondary faults is longer than the main fault by at least a factor of 10. Based on crosscutting relationships and the relationship of OFD to geophysically imaged compliant zones around active faults, we argue that distributed displacement is an active process and suggest that zones of diminished rigidity near faults may be at least in part driven by secondary faulting during the rupture propagation along the main fault.					; Shelef, Eitan/B-7077-2017	Shelef, Eitan/0000-0003-0672-5144; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				MAY 14	2010	115								B05308	10.1029/2009JB006289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JB006289													WOS:000277707900001
J	van Eerden, MR; van Rijn, S				van Eerden, Mennobart R.; van Rijn, Stef			Social hierarchy within communal foraging flocks of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo as reflected by differences in prey composition and food intake at the roost	ARDEA												Day-fresh Great Cormorant pellets were collected at a huge single winter roost at Kreupel island in Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands. The roost is situated on a sandy island, 3 m above the water level and is regularly used by 1000-8000+ Cormorants. By examining pellets and thus reconstructing the previous day's meal of Cormorants gathering at the roost, we explored spatio-temporal differences in the diet of individual birds. We found that structural differences in pellets (size, colour and structure) are related to their content (fish species and fresh mass of a daily meal). Structurally larger and lighter coloured pellets contained larger and coarser fish and represented a higher total fish mass. Pellets of different size and structure were non-randomly distributed at the roost. Birds positioned centrally in the roost produced on average larger pellets than birds at the edges. Cormorants having few or no food remains in their pellets were more frequently recorded on the edge of the roost than in the centre and in particular, they were more likely to be located to the rear of the roost. The same was true for pellets showing a bloody signature which may be linked to either injury by sharp fin rays or to a parasite induced effect. Pellet data were corroborated by observations of differential distribution of faecal splashes of Cormorants, showing that individuals in the centre of the roost produced most guano. Clear diet differences existed within the roost between birds in the centre and elsewhere in the roost, whereas smaller differences existed between the front, edge and rear of the roost. Our data suggest a social hierarchy based on higher foraging success of birds returning earlier to the roost and settling in the centre, hereby forcing later arriving and less successful Cormorants towards the edge, rear and front position. We conclude that position at the roost is a reflection of previous foraging success, possibly caused by differences in dominance between Cormorants during the period of communal foraging. From a methodological point of view, our study demonstrates that, because of structural differences in pellets and spatial differences in occurrence, it is important to collect pellets randomly if one is to describe a proper diet sample by using pellets at any given site. Especially in marshlands and under trees and bush growth with a lot of litter, the likely collection of larger, more conspicuous pellets will cause a bias towards the larger fish species and sizes. Also sampling only at edge locations or specifically at the centre of a roost may give biased results, as this may result in an under- or overestimation in reconstructed fish uptake (e.g. fish size, mass, species) from the waterbody under study.																			0373-2266	2213-1175				DEC	2021	109	3					549	563		10.5253/arde.v109i2.a23	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/arde.v109i2.a23													WOS:000825150800023

In this study we have monitored, from April 2009 (a few months after its first flooding) to September 2012, the dynamics of charophyte growth and related physical, chemical and biotic variables to highlight the factors determining charophyte success. Just after flooding, five charophyte species grew spontaneously when oospores germinated in the sediments. Chara hispida populations largely dominated the community and developed dense meadows that covered virtually the entire pond floor. Charophytes exerted a negative influence on phytoplankton densities, increasing water transparency. C. hispida stands precipitated substantial CaCO3 in the form of incrustations on the plants, accompanied by coprecipitation of inorganic phosphorus, maintaining low concentrations of soluble P in the water. Reduced groundwater inflow, increased salinity, nutrient concentration, turbidity and augmented feeding pressure by waterfowl, separately or by synergistic effects, considerably reduced charophyte development during the final year of the study; however, charophytes still represent one of the most extensive and dense stands of submerged vegetation within AVNP, verifying the achievement of the goal of the restoration plan. The knowledge obtained has allowed us to recommend several measures to counteract the decrease of charophytes, which can also be applied in other regions affected by the same stressors.

Here we present 25(10)Be cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages of boulders collected on moraines from three glaciers located on Clavering Island (northeastern Greenland).CREages span 16.29 +/- 0.79 to 0.37 +/- 0.05 ka and reveal three periods of moraine formation during the Lateglacial, the Early and the Late Holocene. Data show a multi-modal distribution of the ages during the Lateglacial with exposure ages spanning from 16.29 +/- 0.79 to 12.31 +/- 1.3 ka. At least two glaciers experienced a greater expansion at the beginning of the Holocene than at the end of the Holocene, dated to 11.3 +/- 0.3 and 10.8 +/- 0.6 ka, respectively. At the end of the Holocene, glacial advances occurred during the Dark Ages Cold Period and during the Little Ice Age (LIA), synchronous with glacial advances documented in nearby lake sediments. This newCREchronology highlights that theLIAextent is not the largest glacier advance in the Late Holocene in Clavering Island. This broadly corresponds with other mountain glaciers of western and northern Greenland, and does not appear to reflect northern high latitude summer insolation that would suggest progressive temperature decrease, but instead mimics recent regional continental temperature reconstructions that show a long term warming driven by different forcing.					; rinterknecht, vincent/A-9229-2010; Lane, Timothy/AAA-8909-2022; , B/HZK-8896-2023; jomelli, vincent/AAO-9488-2020; Braucher, Regis/Q-5971-2017	Rinterknecht, Vincent/0000-0002-5410-2075; Lane, Timothy/0000-0002-7116-9976; BIETTE, melody/0000-0003-2733-3684; Jomelli, vincent/0000-0002-4512-5216; Braucher, Regis/0000-0002-4637-4302													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2020	49	4					873	885		10.1111/bor.12460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12460		JUL 2020											WOS:000550899200001

Lawrence			Precipitation changes over the eastern Bolivian Andes inferred from speleothem (δ18O) records for the last 1400 years	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Here we present high-resolution delta O-18 records obtained from speleothems collected in the eastern Bolivian Andes. The stable isotope records are related to the regional- to large-scale atmospheric circulation over South America and allow interpreting changes in delta O-18 during the last 1400 yr as a function of changes in precipitation regimes over the southern tropical Andes. Two distinct phases with more negative delta O-18 values, interpreted as periods of increased convective activity over the eastern Andean Cordillera in Bolivia are observed concomitantly with periods of global climate anomalies during the last millennium, such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) respectively. Changes in the Bolivian delta O-18 record during the LIA are apparently related to a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which acts as a main moisture driver to intensify convection over the tropical continent. During the MCA, however, the increased convective activity observed in the Bolivian record is likely the result of a different mechanism, which implies moisture sourced mainly from the southern tropical Atlantic. This interpretation is consistent with paleoclimate records further to the north in the tropical Andes that show progressively drier conditions during this time period, indicating a more northerly position of the ITCZ. The transition period between the MCA and the LIA shows a slight tendency toward increased delta O-18 values, indicating weakened convective activity. Our results also reveal a non-stationary anti-phased behavior between the delta O-18 reconstructions from Bolivia and northeastern Brazil that confirms a continental-scale east-west teleconnection across South America during the LIA.

J	Hanrahan, G; Gibani, S; Miller, K				Hanrahan, Grady; Gibani, Siraj; Miller, Kent			Multivariate chemometrical classification and assessment of Lake Tuendae: A Mojave desert aquatic environment housing the endangered Mojave Tui Chub	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Lake Tuendae is a shallow, alkaline, artificially constructed Mojave Desert aquatic environment housing the endangered Mojave Tui Chub (Gila bicolar mohavensis). Detailed physiological response studies have been reported on the Mojave Tui Chub but few on the physico-chemical state of Lake Tuendae, one of four key Mojave Desert habitats for this species. Two sampling campaigns (spring 2004 and 2005) were conducted with correlation analysis, cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) of physico-chemical water column and surface sediment quality parameters performed. CA proved useful in displaying parameter similarity for initial interpretation. PCA proved to be a more reliable display model and permitted the reduction of 14 parameters for the water column to four principal components accounting for 71% of the total variability. For surface sediments, four principal components accounted for 81% of the total variability. This work highlights the successful use of chemometric multivariate techniques in helping elucidate the physicochemical make-up of shallow desert aquatic environments, and instructive for investigators assessing the health of aquatic species in such habitats.

However, the large sizes and complexity of most radiations such as those of the cichlids in the African Great Lakes make it impossible to infer the exact evolutionary history of any population divergence event. The genus Alcolapia, a small cichlid lineage endemic to Lakes Magadi and Natron in East Africa, exhibits phenotypes similar to some of those found in cichlids of the radiations of the African Great Lakes. The simplicity within Alcolapia makes it an excellent model system to investigate ecological diversification and speciation. We used an integrated approach including population genomics based on RAD-seq data, geometric morphometrics and stable isotope analyses to investigate the eco-morphological diversification of tilapia in Lake Magadi and its satellite lake Little Magadi. Additionally, we reconstructed the demographic history of the species using coalescent simulations based on the joint site frequency spectrum. The population in Little Magadi has a characteristically upturned mouthpossibly an adaptation to feeding on prey from the water surface. Eco-morphological differences between populations within Lake Magadi are more subtle, but are consistent with known ecological differences between its lagoons such as high concentrations of nitrogen attributable to extensive guano deposits in Rest of Magadi relative to Fish Springs Lagoon. All populations diverged simultaneously only about 1100 generations ago. Differences in levels of gene flow between populations and the effective population sizes have likely resulted in the inferred heterogeneous patterns of genome-wide differentiation.

J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			The Drying Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada: Review and Synthesis of Cryo-Hydrologic Controls and Projections to Future Climatic Conditions	SUSTAINABILITY												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta, Canada is one of the world's largest inland freshwater deltas, home to large populations of waterfowl, muskrat, beaver, and free-ranging wood bison. The delta region has been designated a Ramsar wetland of international importance and is largely located within the Wood Buffalo National Park, itself being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Indigenous residents have depended on the delta for centuries to sustain their culture and lifeways. In the past five decades, the PAD has experienced prolonged dry periods in-between rare floods, accompanied by reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life. Recharge of the higher-elevation, or "perched", basins depends on overland flooding generated by major spring ice jams that occasionally form in the lower reaches of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers and in their various distributaries. Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and Historical Records for the unregulated Athabasca River are relatively scarce, but conclusively demonstrate the role of ice jams in replenishing perched basins of the Athabasca sector of the PAD. Similar information, coupled with extensive hydrometric and observational data for the regulated Peace River have enabled elucidation of the physical mechanisms that lead to ice-jam flooding of the Peace sector and assessment of regulation impacts on flood frequency. Such understanding can inform design of remedial strategies to moderate or arrest the drying trend of the delta. Climate-related projections to future scenarios suggest reduced frequency of ice-jam floods, albeit with uncertainty.

Therefore, several research groups measured the radiocesium in the sediments in lakes and rivers, as well as soils around rivers, lakes and mountains. In this study, we investigated not only the concentration of radiocesium contained in wasted-sludge samples from a water purification plant, but also the leachate behaviors from the sludge to water. As results, the concentrations of radiocesium in wasted-sludge samples collected from a water purification plant at Kiryu Bureau of Waterworks on 2013 were obviously lower than that on 2011. Additionally, the degrees of radiocesium concentrations were related to those of turbidities in raw water of the water supply. Through leachate tests of radiocesium using aqueous solutions adjusted from pH 2 to pH 10, the risk leaching from wasted-sludge to water was considered to be low without any regard to the pH values of the solutions. Furthermore, the chemical forms of radiocesium in the sludge by a sequential extraction method were expected to mainly exist as residue and oxide fauns, which are classified as fractions hardly eluted in nature.

The East Kirkton Lagerstatte: a window onto early Carboniferous land ecosystems	TERRESTRIAL CONSERVATION LAGERSTATTEN: WINDOWS INTO THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE ON LAND												The late Visean (early Brigantian) locality of East Kirkton near Bathgate in Scotland is noted for its wealth of fossils, where the unusual environment of the East Kirkton Limestone facilitated unusual preservation of animals and plants. These include the earliest known terrestrial fauna, comprising six new genera and seven new tetrapods species: Balanerpeton, Eldeceeon, Eucritta, Kirktonecta, Silvanerpeton, Westlothiana, and Ophiderpeton kirktonense. Among them are stem members of the crown groups of tetrapods; amphibians and amniotes. Actinopterygians, and a few acanthodians and chondrichthyans are restricted to the topmost horizons of the sequence. Seven groups of invertebrates are represented, including a new species of a terrestrial scorpion Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis, the second oldest known opilionid Brigantobunum, eurypterids, and myriapods. A rich flora was present among which was a new genus Stanwoodia, named for the discoverer of the quarry. Set in a landscape of nearby volcanic activity, the environment represents a shallow lake into which warm or occasionally hot springs fed, but which was usually too mineral-rich to support an aquatic fauna. Volcaniclastic sediments such as tuffs preserve some of the fossils as individual bones, whereas other strata consist of black organic-rich mudstones, which preserve small but almost complete articulated tetrapods. Among the varied and complex lithologies are laminites that are often deformed and folded, and botryoidal or stromatolitic limestones that suggest bacterial or algal growths.																					978-1-78046-014-7				2017							39	64																WOS:000428548300003
J	Fletcher, WJ; Debret, M; Goñi, MFS				Fletcher, William J.; Debret, Maxime; Goni, Maria Fernanda Sanchez			Mid-Holocene emergence of a low-frequency millennial oscillation in western Mediterranean climate: Implications for past dynamics of the North Atlantic atmospheric westerlies	HOLOCENE												The nature and tempo of Holocene climate variability is examined in the record of forest vegetation from western Mediterranean marine core MD95-2043. Episodes of forest decline occurred at 10.1, 9.2, 8.3, 7.4, 5.4-4.5 and 3.7-2.9 cal. ka BP, and between 1.9 cal. ka BP and the top of the record (1.3 cal. ka BP). Wavelet analysis confirms a similar to 900 yr periodicity prior to and during the early Holocene and the dominance of a similar to 1750 yr periodicity after 6 cal. ka BP. The similar to 900 yr periodicity has counterparts in numerous North Atlantic and Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records, and in solar irradiance proxies (Delta C-14 and Be-10), and may relate to a Sun-climate connection during the early Holocene. Comparisons between the MD95-2043 forest record and strategically located records from Morocco, Iceland, Norway and Israel suggest that the similar to 1750 yr mid- to late-Holocene oscillation reflects shifts between a prevailing strong and weak state of the zonal flow, with impacts similar to the positive and negative modes of the present-day North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The mid-to late-Holocene millennial oscillation in zonal flow appears closely coupled to North Atlantic surface ocean circulation dynamics, and may have been driven by an internal oscillation in deep-water convection strength. The findings suggest that the mid-Holocene transition in western Mediterranean climate was accompanied by a shift in the fundamental tempo of millennial-scale variability, reflecting contrasting sensitivity of the North Atlantic climate system to different forcing factors (solar versus oceanic) under deglacial and fully interglacial conditions.					; Debret, Maxime/L-4236-2017; Sanchez Goñi, Maria Fernanda/R-3699-2019	Sanchez Goni, Maria Fernanda/0000-0001-8238-7488; Debret, Maxime/0000-0002-8852-0152; Fletcher, William/0000-0001-8918-0690; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2013	23	2					153	166		10.1177/0959683612460783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683612460783													WOS:000313980100001

EXPOSURE OF ALASKA BROWN BEARS (URSUS ARCTOS) TO BACTERIAL, VIRAL, AND PARASITIC AGENTS VARIES SPATIOTEMPORALLY AND MAY BE INFLUENCED BY AGE	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												We collected blood and serum from 155 brown bears (Ursus arctos) inhabiting five locations in Alaska, US during 2013-16 and tested samples for evidence of prior exposure to a suite of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents. Antibody seroprevalence among Alaska brown bears was estimated to be 15% for Brucella spp., 10% for Francisella tularensis, 7% for Leptospira spp., 18% for canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), 5% for canine distemper virus (CDV), 5% for canine parvovirus, 5% for influenza A virus (IAV), and 44% for Toxoplasma gondii. No samples were seropositive for antibodies to Trichinella spp. Point estimates of prior exposure to pathogens among brown bears at previously unsampled locations generally fell within the range of estimates for previously or contemporaneously sampled bears in Alaska. Statistical support was found for variation in antibody seroprevalence among bears by location or age cohort for CAV-1, CDV, IAV, and T. gondii. There was limited concordance in comparisons between our results and previous serosurveys regarding spatial and age-related trends in antibody seroprevalence among Alaska brown bears suggestive of temporal variation. However, we found evidence that the seroprevalence of CAV-1 antibodies is consistently high in bears inhabiting southwest Alaska and the cumulative probability of exposure may increase with age. We found evidence for seroconversion or seroreversion to six different infectious agents in one or more bears. Results of this study increase our collective understanding of disease risk to both Alaska brown bear populations and humans that utilize this resource.					; Cleveland, Chris/HOH-0036-2023	Yabsley, Michael/0000-0003-2452-5015; Crupi, Anthony/0000-0003-2788-6238; ihsan, inas/0009-0008-6832-5123; joly, kyle/0000-0001-8420-7452; Cleveland, Christopher/0000-0002-5437-4011; Gustine, Dave/0000-0003-1087-1937													0090-3558	1943-3700				JUL	2019	55	3					576	588		10.7589/2018-07-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2018-07-173								30557123					WOS:000474612100005

The shoreline record broadly matches other regional climate records, with lake level closely following Northern Hemisphere summer insolation overprinted by sub-millennial lake-level oscillations. A model coupling modem land runoff and lake surface heat closely reproduces estimated modem precipitation of approximate to 240 mm/yr. We estimate that the Baqan Tso basin required approximate to 380 mm/yr precipitation to sustain the maximum early Holocene lake area, a 55% increase over modem. Precipitation increases, not glacial meltwater, drove lake-level changes, as Baqan Tso basin was not glaciated during the Holocene. Our estimate assumes early Holocene insolation (approximate to 1.3% overall increase), and mean annual increases of 2 degrees C in temperature, and 37% in relative humidity. We additionally developed a Holocene precipitation history for Baqan Tso using dated paleolake areas. Using the modern and early Holocene model results as end-members, we estimate precipitation in the western Tibetan Plateau which was 300-380 mm/yr between 5.0 and 11.5 ka, with error of +/- 29-57 mm/yr (+/- 12-15%).

J	Molloy, C; Shane, P; Augustinus, P				Molloy, Catherine; Shane, Phil; Augustinus, Paul			Eruption recurrence rates in a basaltic volcanic field based on tephra layers in maar sediments: Implications for hazards in the Auckland volcanic field	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Long-term eruption recurrence rates in monogenetic basaltic volcanic fields are difficult to assess because of low eruption frequencies, but they are important because of the spread of human infrastructure into such fields. Auckland City, New Zealand, is built on the Auckland volcanic field, a young (<250 ka) basaltic volcanic field. In the absence of abundant material for radiocarbon and isotopic dating, an eruptive chronology based on basalt tephra layers deposited in maar lakes was developed. Interbedded, well-dated tephra layers from silicic volcanoes some 220-270 km to the south were used as age constraints. The basalt tephra layers reveal a pattern of activity not evident from the temporal-spatial distribution of volcanic landforms. Twenty-four basalt tephra layers over the last 80 k.y. represent an average frequency of one per 3.5 k.y. Recurrence times vary from <0.5 k.y. to 20 k.y. and show no temporal trend. The tephra record shows a major "flare-up" in explosive activity at 32 +/- 2 ka during heightened activity at 34-24 ka. This was related to a period of simultaneous eruptions from several volcanoes across the field revealed by paleomagnetic and isotopic ages. In contrast, the field has been relatively quiet during the last 20 k.y., punctuated by the construction of a shield volcano at 0.7 ka. Thus, the surface manifestation of magmatism varies greatly with time, complicating long-term volcanic hazard forecasting. Despite the high risk from future basalt activity because of proximity, ash fall from distant andesite volcanoes is the most frequently occurring volcanic hazard in Auckland City.

About 300 sites were sampled once each during two summers for macrobenthos, as well as for sediment textural characters. Mayflies from the survey were either Ephemera (probably E. simulans) or Hexagenia (at least partly H. limbata), and occurred primarily at depths less than 20 but up to 66 m. Both taxa were restricted to sand, silty or sandy silt bottoms, and occurred more frequently in the Lake Michigan and southern Lake Huron parts of the study area than in the northern Lake Huron part of the Straits. Limited data on body length frequencies indicate a life cycle longer than 2 years for at least part of the Hexagenia population. Areas of low densities were related to lower temperatures and indicators of low pelagic primary production. Absence of ephemerids from several subsequent surveys of parts of the study area raises the possibility that mayflies have disappeared from the Straits since 1956.																			0380-1330						1988	14	2					171	177		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71546-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71546-4													WOS:A1988N631100007

Canada occupies a unique geographic position on the globe: almost half of the planet's northern cryosphere falls within Canada's territorial boundaries. Under the current conditions of rapid climate change over northern high latitudes, Canada has an obligation to measure, model, and understand the complex relationships between the cryosphere and the Earth's climate system in order to provide accurate and timely information on cryospheric variability and change to the public and decision makers. Access to timely, comprehensive, and quality cryospheric data is an obstacle to improved knowledge and understanding of the cryosphere in Canada. Important data sets reside in various government or university labs, where they remain largely unknown or where access restrictions prevent effective use. The Canadian Cryospheric Information Network (CCIN) was designed to address this problem by improving the availability and access to cryospheric data sets. In this paper we describe the functionality of the CON and its benefits for both the Canadian cryospheric research community and the public at large.																					0-7803-7536-X				2002							214	216																WOS:000179116800070

Observations were made on adult midge swarms in the area surrounding the lakes. Chlorpyrifos, temephos, fenthion, malathion and Bactimos (Bacillus thuringiensis serotype H-14) were evaluated in the laboratory against field-collected larvae. Only Chironomus salinarius was recovered from the lakes with densities ranging from 178-25,775 and 89-33,330/m2 in East Lake and West Lake, respectively. Larval populations within 1 km of shore along the city were significantly higher than in the remaining area of each lake. Swarms of adult C. salinarius were the densest at night around fluorescent and incandescent white lights as compared to those lights of blue, green and red colors. Larvae of C. salinarius were most susceptible to chlorpyrifos (LC90 = 0.0032 ppm) and least to fenthion (LC90 = 0.091 ppm). Bactimos was relatively ineffective (LC90 = 5.07 ppm). Treatment of a partial area of each lake (within 1 km of Orbetello) with chlorpyrifos or temephos will probably produce a significant reduction of midge larvae.

Small Reservoirs as a Beneficial Management Practice for Nitrogen Removal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												There are few beneficial management practices (BMPs) with demonstrated efficacy in snowmelt-dominated regions. Small reservoirs are a BMP that can help mitigate flooding and reduce sediment transport, while reducing export of dissolved nutrients. To understand controls on nitrate removal and assess how this ecosystem service can be optimized, denitrification activity was measured in reservoirs and stream pools of the Tobacco Creek Model Watershed (Manitoba, Canada) via the chloramphenicol-amended acetylene block technique. Denitrification activity was positively correlated with nitrate and sediment organic carbon (SOC), and negatively correlated with sediment particle size and pH. Reservoirs exhibited higher denitrification activity than stream pools and were associated with higher levels of SOC, higher nitrate in early summer, and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Nitrate was added to a set of samples to test for nitrate saturation, an indicator of poor ecological status, where nitrate concentrations exceed the denitrification capacity of microbes. Forty-nine percent of measurements demonstrated nitrate saturation, indicative of the need for additional remediation activity. Findings from this research suggest this BMP has higher capacity for nitrogen removal than stream pools because of higher denitrification rates and a higher apparent threshold for nitrate saturation, coupled with increased residence times. Results also inform the construction of additional reservoirs, which have been identified as a priority BMP in this region. Siting reservoirs in areas where conditions contribute to buildup of fine sediments and planting riparian vegetation to foster high organic C availability may help optimize denitrification, although tradeoffs in terms of other ecosystem services must be considered.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					96	104		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0252	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2016.07.0252								28177420					WOS:000392271400012

We subjected 141 consecutive adult patients and nine children to antegrade/retrograde cardioplegia using rapid transatrial insertion of the Retroplegia cannula (Research Medical, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah). Single venous cannulation was used in 116 patients having coronary artery bypass grafting or aortic valve replacement, or both. Initial antegrade blood cardioplegia caused immediate arrest (< 1 minute) and the cardioplegic dose was divided equally between antegrade and retrograde delivery. Included are 95 patients having isolated bypass grafting (34 with extending infarction, cardiogenic shock, or ejection fraction < 20%); 19 having coronary reoperations, 42 with aortic or mitral valve procedures, or both; and nine children having repair of congenital defects (e.g., repair of ventricular septal defect, Rastelli operation, Konno operation). Septal temperature in patients with occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery fell to 11.5.degree. .+-. 0.5.degree.C after retrograde cardioplegia versus only 16.degree. .+-. 3.degree.C after antegrade cardioplegia (p < 0.05). The overall hospital mortality rate was 2% and no complications followed transatrial retrograde cannulation of the coronary sinus.																			0022-5223	1097-685X				JUL	1990	100	1					56	64											2366565					WOS:A1990DN23500008

Use of bottom outlets resulted in weaker thermal stratification, a less pronounced oxygen deficit in the hypolimnion. and significantly lower P retention (17%) in comparison with surface discharge (42%). Factors apparently contributing to lower retention of P during the use of bottom outlets were: (i) faster flushing of the hypolimnion which intensified longitudinal transport of particles, (ii) more intense P release from sediments due to a lower concentration of nitrate in the water column and to more frequent contact of sediments in the shallows with water of pH > 9, During both periods, phytoplankton production was limited only by light, not by nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was comparable in both Years despite some differences in vertical distribution.

J	Penn, MR; Auer, MT				Penn, MR; Auer, MT			Seasonal variability in phosphorus speciation and deposition in a calcareous, eutrophic lake	MARINE GEOLOGY					1994 Ocean Science Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union	FEB 21-22, 1994	SAN DIEGO, CA	Amer Geophys Union				Settling particulate matter was collected in sediment traps from the major depositional basin of Onondaga Lake, a calcareous, eutrophic lake in Syracuse, New York, U.S.A. Sediment traps were deployed at three depths from July to November and for a brief period under ice cover in February to investigate both vertical and seasonal variations in sedimentation. A sequential chemical extraction (fractionation) method was applied to the collected material to quantify the following phosphorus (P) fractions, or forms: loosely bound-P (sorbed-P, CaCO3 associated-P, and Fe and Al bound-P), extractable biogenic-P (easily degradable organic-P and biogenic inorganic polyphosphates), calcium mineral-P (e.g., apatite), and refractory organic-P. Extractable biogenic-P and refractory organic-P were strongly correlated, suggesting a common, autochthonous origin in plankton. Calcium mineral-P appears to be of terrigenous origin. A dramatic increase in the loosely bound-P content of the particulate matter was observed during fall turnover when dissolved Fe2+, which had accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnion, mixed with the surface waters and oxidized with attendant adsorption of P. We estimate that the labile-, or exchangeable-P (i.e. loosely bound- and extractable biogenic-P forms) content of the settling particulates constitutes similar to 50% of the total P influx to the sediments over the period of study. The labile-P flux over the July-November study period was 11 mg P m(-2) day(-1) and the labile-P flux estimated from sediment traps deployed under ice cover was 6 mg P m(-2) day(-1). From these values the annual average labile-P flux to the sediments was estimated to be 9 mg P m(-2) day(-1), only slightly less than the estimated annual average sediment P release rate of 10 mg P m(-2) day(-1). This indicates that the sediments are approximately at steady state with respect to current external P loadings to the lake.

Dynamics of the Askja caldera July 2014 landslide, Iceland, from seismic signal analysis: precursor, motion and aftermath	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												Landslide hazard motivates the need for a deeper understanding of the events that occur before, during, and after catastrophic slope failures. Due to the destructive nature of such events, in situ observation is often difficult or impossible. Here, we use data from a network of 58 seismic stations to characterise a large landslide at the Askja caldera, Iceland, on 21 July 2014. High data quality and extensive network coverage allow us to analyse both long- and short-period signals associated with the landslide, and thereby obtain information about its triggering, initiation, timing, and propagation. At long periods, a landslide force history inversion shows that the Askja landslide was a single, large event starting at the SE corner of the caldera lake at 23:24:05 UTC and propagating to the NW in the following 2 min The bulk sliding mass was 7-16 x 10(10) kg, equivalent to a collapsed volume of 35-80 x 10(6) m(3). The sliding mass was displaced downslope by 1260 +/- 250 m. At short periods, a seismic tremor was observed for 30 min before the landslide. The tremor is approximately harmonic with a fundamental frequency of 2.3 Hz and shows time-dependent changes of its frequency content. We attribute the seismic tremor to stick-slip motion along the landslide failure plane. Accelerating motion leading up to the catastrophic slope failure culminated in an aseismic quiescent period for 2 min before the landslide. We propose that precursory seismic signals may be useful in landslide early-warning systems. The 8 h after the main landslide failure are characterised by smaller slope failures originating from the destabilised caldera wall decaying in frequency and magnitude. We introduce the term "afterslides" for this subsequent, declining slope activity after a large landslide.

Although their monitoring is crucial in times of increased pressure on water resources by both climate change and human interventions, publically available datasets of lake and reservoir levels and volumes are scarce. Within this study, a time series of variation in lake and reservoir volume between 1984 and 2015 were analysed for 137 lakes over all continents by combining the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and the satellite altimetry database DAHITI. The GSW dataset is a highly accurate surface water dataset at 30 m resolution compromising the whole L1T Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archive, which allowed for detailed lake area calculations globally over a very long time period using Google Earth Engine. Therefore, the estimates in water volume fluctuations using the GSW dataset are expected to improve compared to current techniques as they are not constrained by complex and computationally intensive classification procedures. Lake areas and water levels were combined in a regression to derive the hypsometry relationship (dh/dA) for all lakes. Nearly all lakes showed a linear regression, and 42% of the lakes showed a strong linear relationship with a R-2>0.8, an average R-2 of 0.91 and a standard deviation of 0.05. For these lakes and for lakes with a nearly constant lake area (coefficient of variation <0.008), volume variations were calculated. Lakes with a poor linear relationship were not considered. Reasons for low R-2 values were found to be (1) a nearly constant lake area, (2) winter ice coverage and (3) a predominant lack of data within the GSW dataset for those lakes. Lake volume estimates were validated for 18 lakes in the US, Spain, Australia and Africa using in situ volume time series, and gave an excellent Pearson correlation coefficient of on average 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.041, and a normalized RMSE of 7.42%. These results show a high potential for measuring lake volume dynamics using a pre-classified GSW dataset, which easily allows the method to be scaled up to an extensive global volumetric dataset. This dataset will not only provide a historical lake and reservoir volume variation record, but will also help to improve our understanding of the behaviour of lakes and reservoirs and their representation in (large-scale) hydrological models.					; Gelati, Emiliano/E-5022-2018; Schwatke, Christian/O-3652-2019; Schwatke, Christian/F-8126-2013	Busker, Tim/0000-0001-7860-9762; Gelati, Emiliano/0000-0002-8972-8561; Schwatke, Christian/0000-0002-4741-3449													1027-5606	1607-7938				FEB 6	2019	23	2					669	690		10.5194/hess-23-669-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-669-2019													WOS:000457842300002

The elevations of terraces and past lake level were measured with a differential global positioning system. A chronology is developed using U-234/Th-230 dating of travertines, Ar-39/Ar-40 dating of pyroclastites and C-14 dating of organic matter. Facies and stratigraphic correlations identify four transgressions (C1', C1 '', C2' and C2 ''), each followed by a regression which ended with low lake levels that caused river incision and terrace formation. Evidence of the oldest transgression (C1') is found in the uppermost reaches of valleys up to 1755 m, an altitude higher than the present lake threshold (1736 m). This C1' transgression may be related to pyroclastic flows which dammed an outlet located in the western part of the lake basin and which is dated to before 105 ka. After 100 ka, a second transgression (C1 '') reached 1730/1735 m, possibly related to a younger ignimbrite flow, in association with high water inflow (warm and/or wetter conditions). The two younger transgressions reached 1700-1705 m. The first one (C2') is dated to 26-24.5 cal. ka BP and the second one (C2 '') to 21-20 cal. ka BP. Available data suggest that the long-term lake-level changes responded mainly to climate oscillations. Additional events such as river captures caused by volcanic falls filling valleys, tectonism, erosion and karstic diversion may have impacted these long-term lake-level changes.

This split window algorithm is based on the thermal radiation data which is observed by NOAA-AVHRR. This paper retrieved land surface temperature and analysis the spatial characteristics of Beijing urban heat island as well as its influencing factors. The result indicates that analysis on urban heat island effect based on split window algorithm of Beijing is available.

A collection of 32 strains was isolated from the highest positive dilutions of most-probable-number series, and their partial 16S rRNA gene sequences and genomic fingerprints based on ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus)-PCR were analyzed. The strains fell into eight distinct phylogenetic lineages, and the majority (70%) showed a close affiliation to the genus Desulfovibrio. Most of the remaining strains (22%) were related to the gram-positive Sporomusa and Desulfotomaculum groups. A high redundancy of 16S rRNA gene sequences was found within several of the phylogenetic lineages. This low phylogenetic diversity was most pronounced for the subset of strains isolated from oxic sediment layers. ERIC-PCR revealed that most of the strains with identical 16S rRNA gene sequences were genetically different. Since strains with identical 16S rRNA gene sequences but different genomic fingerprints also differed considerably with respect to their physiological capabilities, the high diversity detected in the present work is very likely of ecological relevance. Our results indicate that a high diversity of sulfate-reducing bacterial strains can be recovered from the natural environment using the established cultivation media.					; Sass, Henrik/B-8817-2009	Sass, Henrik/0000-0001-8740-4224; Overmann, Jorg/0000-0003-3909-7201													0302-8933					OCT	1998	170	4					243	251		10.1007/s002030050639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002030050639								9732438					WOS:000076123800005

A core, 15 m long, was recovered from the floodplains associated with a typical backwater body (lake) in the southwestern coast of India. The granulometric analysis proved dominance of sand and silt fractions and extremely high energy conditions over the entire core. The TOC/TN ratio indicated a domination of the C4 -type over the C3 -type plants in the lower half of the core, suggesting a warm climate. The C3 -type plants prevail in the upper part of the core, thus reflecting cool and wet environments. Extremely low values of TOC/TN ratio (0.33% to 10%) of the core indicate short periods of very high rainfall events and the rapid influx of nutrients to the basin and the eutrophication of the basin. The presence of slightly brackish, brackish/marine and marine benthic foraminifers at 12.5-9 m depth indicates episodes of transgression and regression. The derived AMS radiocarbon dates suggest the Marine Isotope Stage 3 for the lower part of the core.

Identification of a robust Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1917) population in Goulais Bay, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					7th International Symposium on Sturgeons - Sturgeons, Science and Society at the Cross-Roads - Meeting the Challenges of the 21st Century	JUL 21-25, 2013	Nanaimo, CANADA	Vancouver Isl Univ, WSCS				Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1917) in Lake Superior are greatly depressed from their historic abundance, and few populations meet the rehabilitation goals identified by management agencies. A netting program targeting juvenile Lake Sturgeon (ages 3-15) was implemented from 2010 to 2012 in Goulais Bay, a shallow, productive bay in the south-eastern part of the lake, to determine abundance, distribution, population characteristics (size structure, condition, age structure, mortality and growth), and recruitment patterns. Five-hundred and thirty-one individuals were captured over the 3-year study, resulting in a mark-recapture estimate of 4977 (95% CIs 3295-7517) juveniles. Catch rates in this study were higher than in any other location in Lake Superior, with sturgeon being broadly distributed around the bay. Estimated annual survival rate ranged from 0.691 to 0.858, depending on the method used. The majority of fish captured were between 620 and 800mm in total length and were between 4 and 10years of age (range 1-29years). Recruiting year-classes were apparent every year, with no apparent effects due to lampricide treatments (a suspected threat to age-0 Lake Sturgeon) in the Goulais River. Year-class strength was positively related to spring water levels. It is possible that this robust Goulais Bay population could help re-populate the south-eastern part of Lake Superior, which contains a number of large, productive embayment areas that formerly supported large Lake Sturgeon populations.					; Pratt, Thomas/LTC-9063-2024	Pratt, Thomas/0009-0003-3648-2144; 													0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2014	30	6			SI		1328	1334		10.1111/jai.12566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12566													WOS:000345588500033

They can be either perennial or temporary as well as of natural or anthropogenic origin. Despite their small size and isolated nature, they are often considered as reservoirs of biodiversity for neighboring ecosystems, and could in fact be considered as special ecotones that house numerous semi-aquatic species. Although relatively poorly researched, ponds have been shown to contribute to regional biodiversity as much as rivers or lakes. The great local diversity of these petite ecosystems was once again proven in a small perennial pond (approximately 25 meters long and 10 meters wide) in the Dinaric Western Balkan ecoregion, where four water mite species were recorded, three of which are new findings for the water mite fauna of Croatia. Habitat conditions, i.e. macrophyte coverage and environmental water properties of the pond, proved to be suitable for typical pond species such as Piona laminata but also seemed to reflect conditions similar to helocrenes as species usually associated with these spring habitats were also found: Hydryphantes armentarius and Tartarothyas romanica.																				2251-8169				JAN 15	2021	10	1					1	7		10.22073/pja.v10i1.62352	http://dx.doi.org/10.22073/pja.v10i1.62352													WOS:000607745600001
J	Hart, JL; Shankman, D				Hart, JL; Shankman, D			Disjunct eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) stands at its southern range boundary	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) occurs throughout much of the Appalachian Mountains, extending from southern Quebec and Ontario southward to Georgia and along the Appalachian Plateau to Alabama. Eastern hemlock is one of the most dominant trees in Appalachian forests. Near its southern boundary in central Alabama, eastern hemlock occurs in small, isolated populations restricted to cool, moist slopes with north to east aspects and low and middle slope positions. Ten stands of eastern hemlock, believed to be the southernmost populations, were studied in order to determine reproductive viability and habitat characteristics. In each of the stands, eastern hemlock dominates the canopy and is present in a wide range of size and age classes. Eastern hemlock is most abundant in seedling size classes and the number of individuals generally decreases with increasing size. Population size, age, and vertical structure indicate that eastern hemlock stands at the species' southernmost boundary contain viable populations that are regenerating, even if highly localized. During the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, eastern hemlock likely had a broader distribution in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The remnants of this larger distribution are now restricted to steep slopes where a combination of sandstone outcrops, seepage, and springs maintain adequate microclimatic conditions needed for regeneration of the species.

This region of East Africa is under the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone seasonal migration. Thus it has been designated as a potential core site by the ERICA Project ('Environmental Research for Intertropical Climate in Africa'). The four lakes have been subjected to strong changes in water level and water salinity at least during the Late Pleistocene. The purpose of this study is to produce a model of basin formation and sediment accumulation for this system of lakes, in order to separate the effects of climatic change from environmental variations induced by local or regional factors such as volcano-tectonic forcings. In addition to an exhaustive synthesis of available data, various investigations have been used to develop this model: 3D remote sensing, high-resolution seismics, coring, and structural, sedimentological, and hydrological field studies. New AMS radiocarbon dating helped to refine the pre-existing stratigraphic framework for this region, and basin age estimations were calculated using mean sediment accumulation rates. The history of the Ziway-Shala lake basin system has been reconstructed from the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene period (10(6) yr), mainly characterized by catastrophic explosive volcanic eruptions. The early-middle Pleistocene-Late Pleistocene period (10(4)-10(6) yr) was marked by a regional volcano-tectonic paroxysm, resulting in major changes in the morphology of the area, with the formation of the Abijata, Ziway and Shala lake basins. From similar to 0.20 Ma, the Ziway-Shala basin history is marked by the eastward migration of volcano-tectonic activity, resulting in the development of the youngest basin of the Ziway-Shala system, the Langano Basin. The joint history of sedimentation in the Ziway, Langano, Abijata, and Shala lake basins started during the early-late Pleistocene period (10(1)-10(4) yr) and is characterized from this period up to the present-day by a series of climatically controlled rises and falls of lake level.

Previous work by Kitagawa and van der Plicht (1998a,b, 2000) provided such a data set; however, problems with the varve-based age scale of their SG93 sediment core precluded the use of this data set for C-14 calibration purposes. Lake Suigetsu was re-cored in summer 2006, with the retrieval of overlapping sediment cores from 4 parallel boreholes enabling complete recovery of the sediment profile for the present "Suigetsu Varves 2006" project (Nakagawa et al. 2012). Over 550 C-14 determinations have been obtained from terrestrial plant macrofossils picked from the latter SG06 composite sediment core, which, coupled with the core's independent varve chronology, provides the only non-reservoir-corrected C-14 calibration data set across the C-14 dating range. Here, physical matching of archive U-channel sediment from SG93 to the continuous SG06 sediment profile is presented. We show the excellent agreement between the respective projects' C-14 data sets, allowing the integration of 243 C-14 determinations from the original SG93 project into a composite Lake Suigetsu C-14 calibration data set comprising 808 individual C-14 determinations, spanning the last 52,800 cal yr.					; Ramsey, Christopher/A-3277-2012; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020; Yokoyama, Yusuke/N-9623-2013; Bronk Ramsey, Christopher/A-3277-2012; Brock, Fiona/I-4970-2016; van der Plicht, Johannes/B-9994-2013; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/AAB-1500-2021	Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Brock, Fiona/0000-0003-0728-6091; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Tyler, Jonathan/0000-0001-8046-0215; Marshall, Dr Michael/0000-0001-8279-7532; Bronk Ramsey, Christopher/0000-0002-8641-9309; /0000-0002-7219-5009; Staff, Richard/0000-0002-8634-014X; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/0000-0002-1596-7543; Nakagawa, Takeshi/0000-0003-0831-6803													0033-8222	1945-5755					2013	55	4			SI		2049	2058		10.2458/azu_js_rc.v55i2.16339	http://dx.doi.org/10.2458/azu_js_rc.v55i2.16339													WOS:000326817600012
J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, Kenneth H.			Phosphorus and chlorophyll in the Bay of Quinte: A time-series/intervention analysis of 1972-2008 data	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Three independent methods of time-series analysis were applied to a 37-year record of total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a data collected at four sampling stations representing the upper, middle and lower sections of the Bay of Quinte, NE Lake Ontario, Canada. The three methods were used to build consensus around the significance of the apparent declines in total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations following two interventions: (1) point-source phosphorus loading reductions of about 50% to the upper bay in the winter of 19771978 and (2) the establishment of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the early to mid-1990's. The methods were applied to May to October monthly means and included: (1) nonparametric tests that accounted for persistence and seasonality and determined the statistical significance of step-trends, (2) ARIMA-Intervention modelling that produced forecasts into post-intervention time periods that were compared statistically to measured data and (3) regime shift detection for identifying the significance of persistent steps after removal of the seasonal components of the data series (modelled as periodic functions). Strong gradients in total phosphorus (TP) and Chl-a concentrations between the upper and lower Bay of Quinte still existed three decades after reductions in point-source loadings of TP to the upper bay, where, during 20002008, May-October average TP was 3.8 times higher and Chl-a, 2.9 times higher than in the lower bay. The Remedial Action Plan May-October TP objective of 0.030 mg l-1 for the upper Bay of Quinte was not achieved consistently in recent years. Concurrence among the data analysis methods suggests that the relative decreases in the upper bay TP (31%) and Chl-a (37%) after phosphorus loading reductions were greater than in the lower bay (0% and 10%, respectively). The relative decreases in the upper bay TP (0%) and Chl-a (29%) associated with Dreissena establishment were less than those measured in the lower bay (20% and 50%, respectively).																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2012	15	4					421	429		10.1080/14634988.2012.727720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2012.727720													WOS:000312188000006

The history of Plecoptera research in the Czech Republic is briefly summarized. Altogether 95 species are recorded from the Czech Republic (85 species from Bohemia, 81 species from Moravia). In comparison with the previous checklist of Plecoptera, 13 species were added, 8 previously mentioned species were not confirmed, and some misidentifications are discussed. The distribution of species in eight districts based on main river basins, and species frequencies of occurrence and ranges of altitude and stream order of their localities are presented. Evaluation of data on species distribution from the past century enabled re-evaluation of threatened species. The new red list includes 5 regionally extinct, 6 critically endangered, 3 endangered, 10 vulnerable and 12 near threatened species. A special attention is paid to 8 species described from the present territory of the Czech Republic. Their type material, type localities and nomenclature are given and discussed. Nemoura monticola Rauser, 1965, syn. nov., is placed as a junior synonym of Nemoura fusca Kis, 1963.

J	Wen, ZR; Xie, P; Xu, J				Wen, Zhourui; Xie, Ping; Xu, Jun			Contributions of Pelagic and Benthic Dietary Sources to Freshwater Mussels: Evidence from Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												In Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu, tissue of five mussel species showed delta C-13 values similar to or slightly below that of pelagic suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM). This indicated that mussels in this area either fed non-selectively and so reflected available carbon in the pelagic habitat or selected for phytoplankton. The situation was the same for Anodonta woodiana woodiana and Cristaria plicata in Meiliang Bay; however, for the remaining three species, Hyriopsis cumingii, Arconaia lanceolata, and Lamprotula rochechouarti, tissue had intermediate delta C-13 values, falling between those for pelagic SPOM and benthic sediment organic matter (SOM), suggesting a possible preferential selection of phytoplankton from the pelagic SPOM but more likely reflecting local differences in pelagic SPOM and benthic SOM composition and available organic carbon sources. The mixing model showed that pelagic SPOM accounted for over 98% of carbon incorporated by all mussels in Gonghu Bay and two mussels in Meiliang Bay, suggesting the dietary importance of pelagic food sources for mussels. Less than 50% of the assimilation in H. cumingii, A. lanceolata, and L. rochechouarti came from the pelagic carbon sources in Meiliang Bay, which suggested that these species consumed a mix of benthic and pelagic derived carbon sources.

The last decades have seen its rapid geographical spread beyond the species' natural range, particularly in anthropogenically modified water bodies across Asia, America, and Europe where it is now very common. In this paper, we also confirm the presence of S. woodiana in Africa (Algeria) by establishing the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and Ramsar site Oubeira Lake as a new locality for its occurrence. In all likelihood, S. woodiana was accidentally introduced in the 1980s with Asian fish species imported from Hungary for stocking purposes. The present survey was conducted in the summer of 2020, and here we present the first data on several biological aspects of 141 S. woodiana specimens collected in the lake fringe area. The age structure varied from two to over height years old; medium- and large-sized individuals with shell lengths ranging from 102.23 to 183.55 cm accounted for 96% of sampled mussels. A study of the conchological features revealed that bivalves adopt the species' typical morphological trends. Overall, our findings showed that S. woodiana succeeded in establishing a viable population in Oubeira Lake, which allows for the assumption that additional records can be predicted at a regional scale in locations related to the lake water system in Algeria and Tunisia.					; faiza, alliouche/W-3782-2019; ladjama, imene/KBQ-2762-2024; Telailia, Salah/KBQ-6387-2024	Boutabia, Lamia/0000-0002-7757-8228; ladjama, imene/0000-0002-8636-810X; TELAILIA, Salah ( Saleh) (S.)/0000-0002-4653-3764													1300-0179	1303-6114					2023	47	2					94	102		10.55730/1300-0179.3119	http://dx.doi.org/10.55730/1300-0179.3119													WOS:001097380100004

(Ilja); Seibert, Jan			Effect of Observation Errors on the Timing of the Most Informative Isotope Samples for Event-Based Model Calibration	HYDROLOGY												Many studies have shown that isotope data are valuable for hydrological model calibration. Recent developments have made isotope analyses more accessible but event sampling still involves significant time and financial costs. Therefore, it is worth to study how many isotope samples are needed for hydrological model calibration and what the most informative sampling times are. In this study, we used synthetic data to investigate how systematic errors in the precipitation, streamflow and the isotopic composition of precipitation affect the information content of stream isotope samples for model calibration. The results show that model performance improves significantly when two or three isotope samples are used for calibration and that the most informative samples are taken on the falling limb. However, when there are errors in the rainfall isotopic composition, rising limb samples are more informative. Data errors caused the most informative samples to be more clustered and to occur earlier in the event compared to error free data. These results provide guidance on when to sample events for model calibration and thus help to reduce the cost and effort in obtaining useful data for model calibration.

Our study used an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach, blending avian and plant ecology, ecohydraulic, statistical ecology and modelling to evaluate potential impacts of water level fluctuations on indicator species representative of the wetland breeding bird assemblages in the entire LOSL freshwater system. Multi-year (2000-2003) bird surveys captured bird distribution and density in wetland habitats under varying degrees of water inandation, depth and fluctuation. Analyses revealed strong associations between estimated breeding pair densities and plant communities, water depth, and degree of water level fluctuation during the breeding season for a suite of wetland bird species using marsh, wet meadow, shrub swamp and treed swamp habitats. These quantitative associations were used to develop wetland bird performance indicators for use in a LOSL water regulation review study. Several bird species also nest at or near the water surface and are thus vulnerable to nest flooding or stranding. Changes to the seasonal hydrology of Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River that result in an increased frequency or magnitude of these nest failure events may have a significant impact on regional population sustainability. Long term nest record databases were analyzed to create nesting flooding and stranding probability equations based on water level increases and decreases during the breeding season. These species-specific nesting relationships were incorporated into a reproduction index. Many breeding bird species were strongly associated with specific wetland plant communities. Predicted habitat suitability, as measured by estimated breeding pair density, can also change significantly within a specific wetland plant community based solely on changes in water depth during the breeding season. Three indicator species, Black Tern, Least Bittern and Virginia Rail were selected as key environmental performance indicators for alternate regulation plan comparisons. Water regulation criteria should be such that the long term diversity and abundance of wetland plant communities and frequency of spring flooding in marsh habitats during breeding are not reduced. Magnitude and frequency of water level change during the nesting season (May-July) can also adversely impact reproductive success of many wetland bird species. As such, regulation criteria that increase the seasonal magnitude and frequency of water level change may be detrimental to the long term viability of certain regional breeding bird populations.

J	FAHNENSTIEL, GL; SCAVIA, D				FAHNENSTIEL, GL; SCAVIA, D			DYNAMICS OF LAKE-MICHIGAN PHYTOPLANKTON - THE DEEP CHLOROPHYLL LAYER	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The dynamics of the Lake Michigan deep chlorophyll layer (DCL) were studied from the period of late spring isothermal mixing (May) through mid-stratification (July-August) in 1982-1984. After the onset of thermal stratification, the DCL developed in the 15-30 m region and deepened to 25-50 m in July and 40-70 m in August. Chlorophyll and phytoplankton carbon concentrations in the DCL averaged, respectively, 1.80X and 1.34X epilimnetic concentrations during early stratification (June). Those factors increased to 5.70X and 2.60X during mid-stratification. Although phytoplankton carbon concentrations within the DCL changed on average only 31% from May through July-August, phytoplankton species composition exhibited pronounced shifts. Measured phytoplankton growth, sedimentation, and zooplankton grazing rates suggest DCL formation was attributable to in situ growth and to a lesser extent to sedimentation and shade adaptation. By July, sedimentation resulted in a net loss from the DCL. With the deepening of the DCL during mid-stratification, the importance of in situ growth decreased while the importance shade adaptation increased. In situ growth was only important in the upper part of the DCL. Zooplankton grazing increased during mid-stratification and was at least partially responsible for phytoplankton concentrations decreases in the 20-50 m region.

We studied the decadal-scale response of two UK shallow lakes to fish kills using a palaeolimnological approach. Eutrophic and turbid Barningham Lake experienced two fish kills in the early 1950s and late 1970s with fish recovering after both events, whereas less eutrophic, macrophyte-dominated Wolterton Lake experienced one kill event in the early 1970s from which fish failed to recover. Our palaeo-data show fish-driven trophic cascade effects across all trophic levels (covering benthic and pelagic species) in both lakes regardless of pre-kill macrophyte coverage and trophic status. In turbid Barningham Lake, similar to long-term studies of biomanipulations in other eutrophic lakes, effects at the macrophyte level are shown to be temporary after the first kill (c. 20 years) and non-existent after the second kill. In plant-dominated Wolterton Lake, permanent fish disappearance failed to halt a long-term pattern of macrophyte community change (for example, loss of charophytes and over-wintering macrophyte species) symptomatic of eutrophication. Important implications for theory and restoration ecology arise from our study. Firstly, our data support ideas of slow eutrophication-driven change in shallow lakes where perturbations are not necessary prerequisites for macrophyte loss. Secondly, the study emphasises a key need for lake managers to reduce external nutrient loading if sustainable and long-term lake restoration is to be achieved. Our research highlights the enormous potential of multi-indicator palaeolimnology and alludes to an important need to consider potential fish kill signatures when interpreting results.

Plant macrofossil and pollen analyses of a series of sections and cores from Vesturardalur on Trollaskagi show that Betula pubescens grew up to an altitude between 450 and 500 m a.s.l. during optimum conditions in the Holocene. The birch pollen and macrofossil record of core Vesturardalur 2 at ca. 450 m a.s.l., which covers the time from ca. 9200 BP to present, thus represents the first continuous high-resolution reconstruction of the variations of Betula pubescens at the ecological upper limit of tree or shrub birch in northern Iceland. Between ca. 6700 and ca. 6000 BP, a distinct maximum in the influx of Betula pubescens pollen at this site indicates a high position of the shrub line. This can be distinguished from a low influx of tree or shrub birch pollen from ca. 6000 to ca. 5600 BP, and a very pronounced minimum of Betula pubescens in the pollen record around ca. 3300 BP. The inferred depressions of the shrub line can be correlated with evidence for glacier advances and increased slope activity in northern Iceland.

Geochemistry of Zr, Hf, and REE in a wide spectrum of Eh and water composition: The case of Dead Sea Fault system (Israel)	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Along the Jordan Valley-Dead Sea Fault area several natural waters in springs, wells, and catchments occur. The chemical-physical characters of the studied waters allowed for the first time the investigation of the Zr and Hf geochemical behavior, apart from REE, extended to a wide range of Eh, temperature, salinity, and pH conditions. The results of this study indicate that the dissolved Zr and Hf distribution in natural waters is strongly influenced by redox conditions since these in turn drive the deposition of Fe-oxyhydroxides or pyrite. In oxidizing waters saturated or oversaturated in Fe-oxyhydroxides (Group 1), superchondritic Zr/Hf values are measured. On the contrary, in waters where Eh < 0 values occur (Group 2), chondritic Zr/Hf values are found. Superchondritic Zr/Hf values are produced by the preferential Hf scavenging onto Fe-oxyhydroxides that is inhibited under reducing conditions consistent with the water oversaturation relative to pyrite. Redox conditions also influence the amplitude of Ce and Eu anomalies. Oxidized Group-1 waters show negative Ce anomalies related to the oxidative Ce scavenging as CeO2 onto Fe-oxyhydroxide. Reduced Group-2 waters show positive Eu anomaly values consistent with the larger Eu2+ concentration relative to Eu3+ in these waters suggested by model calculations. The higher stability of Eu2+ with respect to its trivalent neighbors along the REE series can explain the above mentioned positive Eu anomaly values. The middle-REE enrichment observed in shale-normalized REE patterns of studied waters can be ascribed to carbonate and/or gypsum dissolution.					; Inguaggiato, Claudio/IAP-1435-2023; D'Alessandro, Walter/GQB-3978-2022; Censi, Paolo/J-2666-2013	Brusca, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6570-9673; D'Alessandro, Walter/0000-0003-1724-0388; Raso, Maria/0009-0009-9993-0075; Censi, Paolo/0000-0002-9583-7692; INGUAGGIATO, Claudio/0000-0003-1332-3602													1525-2027					MAR	2017	18	3					844	857		10.1002/2016GC006704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GC006704													WOS:000399677600002

Heath; Masson, Greg			Restoration of Lake Apopka's North Shore Marsh: High Hopes, Tough Times, and Persistent Progress	WILDLIFE ECOTOXICOLOGY: FORENSIC APPROACHES	Emerging Topics in Ecotoxicology											The story of Lake Apopka is a familiar one to many Floridians and has gained international notoriety. The 12,500-ha lake was once a world-class bass fishery. Then, a century-long decline occurred, traced to the loss of over 8,000 ha of wetlands to farming operations, agricultural discharges laden with phosphorus to the lake, treated wastewater discharges, and input from citrus processing plants. The state of Florida and the Federal Government purchased the property with the goal of restoring the aquatic habitat. Shortly after flooding in the winter of 1998-1999, a bird mortality event occurred, resulting in the deaths of 676 birds, primarily American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), and also including 43 endangered wood storks (Mycteria americana), 58 great blue herons (Ardea herodias), and 34 great egrets (Casmerodius albus). The deaths of the birds, attributed to pesticide toxicosis, resulted in years of research and remediation to ensure the future safety of wildlife on the property. Presently, about 3,000 ha of wetlands have been rehydrated since resuming restoration activities, with no adverse effects to wildlife. The following chapter presents the history of Lake Apopka, the efforts to restore it, and what we have learned along the way.																			1868-1344		978-0-387-89431-7				2011	3						189	211		10.1007/978-0-387-89432-4_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-89432-4_6	10.1007/978-0-387-89432-4												WOS:000300582100007

The sites, Jokela and Koria, are located 5-10 km south of the 1(st) Salpausselka end moraine. Six sedimentary units were identified and interpreted: (1) Baltic Ice Lake (BIL) varved sediments - interbedded, laminated clay and silt with load structures and sand layers in places; (2) homogenous, partly deformed clay; (3) BIL varved sediments, deposited in slightly shallower water - interbedded, laminated clay and silt; (4) BIL drainage from Billingen and the 25-m base-level fall 11 600-11 700 BP - homogenous clay with sand pods and discontinuous sand layers; (5) freshwater varves - clay and silt couplets with lenticular and flaser bedding and load structures and (6) brackish water varves - thick clay and thin silt couplets. These units can be associated with previously described units of the Finnish clay-varve chronology. The results confirm the importance of the drainage unit as a basin-wide key horizon and illustrate the differences in sedimentation in different parts of the Baltic Sea basin. This is evidenced by the diachronous nature of the incursion of brackish water and associated facies change in sediments.

In this region, thaw slumps include a near-vertical headwall, a floor of low gradient (2-10 degrees) and a steeply sloping evacuation channel (15-25 degrees) that connects the floor of the thaw slumps to Willow River located 60-150 m below. All thaw slumps on the Aklavik Plateau are located within the glacial limit of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the majority developed on the western side of the valley on gently sloping terrain. Aerial photographic analysis showed an increase in thaw slump initiation from 0.35 new thaw slump yr(-1) over the 1954-71 period to 0.68 new thaw slump yr(-1) over the 1985-2004 period. This increase follows the pattern of the 10-year running mean summer air temperature record over the 1950-2004 period. However, the total number of active mature thaw slumps oil the Aklavik Plateau decreased from a maximum of 46 in 1950 to a minimum of 24 observed in 2004, which follows, to a certain extent, the 10-year running average of rainfall. Both these trends may relate to the influence of climate oil the erosional processes that are thought to initiate thaw slumps and keep them active in regions of highlands.

As the geological and tectonic setting of this region is incompletely known, especially the part lying in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we compiled homogeneous cross-border tectonic and neotectonic maps. The seismic risk assessment is based on a new earthquake catalogue based on the ISC reviewed earthquake catalogue and supplemented by other local catalogues and new macroseismic epicenter data spanning 126 years, with 1068 events. The magnitudes have been homogenized to Mw and aftershocks removed. The final catalogue used for the seismic hazard assessment spans 60 years, from 1955 to 2015, with 359 events and a magnitude of completeness of 4.4. The seismotectonic zonation into 7 seismic source areas was done on the basis of the regional geological structure, neotectonic fault systems, basin architecture and distribution of thermal springs and earthquake epicenters. The Gutenberg-Richter seismic hazard parameters were determined by the least square linear fit and the maximum likelihood method. Seismic hazard maps have been computed using existing attenuation laws with the Crisis 2012 software. We obtained higher PGA values (475 years return period) for the Kivu rift region than the previous estimates. They also vary laterally in function of the tectonic setting, with the lowest value in the volcanically active Virunga - Rutshuru zone, highest in the currently non volcanic parts of Lake Kivu, Rusizi valley and North Tanganyika rift zone, and intermediate in the regions flanking the axial rift zone.

Here we demonstrate the importance of integrating records from locations close to the volcano with those in distal regions to generate more comprehensive event stratigraphies. The annually laminated (varved) and intensely radiocarbon dated lacustrine sediments of Lake Suigetsu (SG06 core), Japan are used to place chronological constraints on the tempo of volcanism at two stratovolcanoes located favourably upwind of the lake along the South-West Japan Arc, Sambe and Daisen. Major and trace element glass compositions are used to assign visible ash (tephra) layers preserved in the SG06 sediment core to past explosive eruptions from these volcanoes. Integrating these stratigraphies confirm that the 150 ka long lake sequence records nine visible ash layers from Daisen and five from Sambe. The SG06 record captures two periods of closely spaced eruptions at Daisen volcano. The first period begins at similar to 61.1 ka with three explosive eruptions over similar to 10 ka, with two events separated by as little as 1.5 ka. One layer (SG06-4281), dated at 59.6 +/- 5.5 ka (95.4% probability), relates to the large magnitude, and widely dispersed Daisen Kurayoshi Pumice (DKP) eruption. The other period of frequent activity began at 29,837 +/- 96 IntCal13 yrs. BP (95.4% probability) with five widely dispersed ash fall events associated with explosive eruptions separated by approximately 6, 936, 5 and 438 years. The integrated proximal-distal event stratigraphy and the high-precision SG06 chronology provide unique insights into the timing and frequency of past explosive volcanism from Daisen and Sambe, which has implications for the prediction of future eruption scenarios.

Syndonia			Effects of arctic shrub expansion on biophysical vs. biogeochemical drivers of litter decomposition	ECOLOGY												Climate warming in arctic tundra may shift dominant vegetation from graminoids to deciduous shrubs, whose functional traits could, in turn, alter biotic and abiotic controls over biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). We investigated whether shrub-induced changes in microclimate have stronger effects on litter decomposition and nutrient release than changes in litter quality and quantity. In arctic tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA, we incubated a common substrate in a snow-addition experiment to test whether snow accumulation around arctic deciduous shrubs altered the environment enough to increase litter decomposition rates. We compared the influence of litter quality on the rate of litter and N loss by decomposing litter from four different plant functional types in a common site. We used aboveground net primary production values and estimated decay constant (k) values from our decomposition experiments to calculate community-weighted mass loss for each site. Snow addition had no effect on decomposition of the common substrate, and the site with the highest abundance of shrubs had the lowest decomposition rates. Species varied in their decomposition rates, with species from the same functional type not always following similar patterns. Community-weighted mass loss was 1.5 times greater in the high shrub site, and only slightly decreased when adjusted for soil environment, suggesting that litter quality and quantity are the primary drivers of community decomposition. Our findings suggest that on a short time scale, the changes in soil environment associated with snow trapping by shrubs are unlikely to influence litter nutrient turnover enough to drive positive snow-shrub feedbacks. The mechanisms driving shrub expansion are more likely to do with shrub-litter feedbacks, where the higher growth rates and N uptake by shrubs allows them to produce more leaves, resulting in a larger litter N pool and faster internal cycling of nutrients.

J	Yang, ZQ; Hu, LT; Sun, KN				Yang, Zhengqiu; Hu, Litang; Sun, Kangning			The potential impacts of a water transfer project on the groundwater system in the Sugan Lake Basin of China	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The ungauged Sugan Lake Basin represents a candidate area for development of a water transfer scheme to satisfy the water requirement of Dunhuang city in northwestern China. In this work, multisource data, including river runoff, groundwater levels and remote-sensing data, and field investigation records, were collected and analyzed. A three-dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using FEFLOW software to predict the potential influence of the transfer project on the groundwater system. Results show that infiltration from the Great Harten River is the main driving factor of groundwater-level fluctuation and groundwater recharge. Scenario analysis under four water transfer conditions found that the drawdown of groundwater gradually decreases from east to west. If the water transfer scale reaches 1.2 x 10(8) m(3)/a, after 100 years, the maximum drawdown of groundwater is noted at 68.02 m, and the flow rate of the Middle Spring reduces by 25.7%. In the western wetland, the area over which the groundwater level is lowered by more than 4 m is 10.21 km(2), and natural succession may occur or vegetation cover may decline. The results of this study will aid in water resource planning based on a rational amount of water transfer, and provide further protection of the wetland ecology.

From 1991 to 1996 feather (n = 455) and blood (n = 381) samples from adult loons were collected between June and September in five regions of North America: Alaska, northwestern United States, Upper Great Lakes, New England, and the Canadian Maritimes. Concentrations of Hg in adults ranged from 2.8 to 36.7 mu g/g (fresh weight) in feathers and from 0.12 to 7.80 mu g/g (wet weight) in whole blood. Blood Kg concentrations in 3 to 6-week-old juveniles ranged from 0.03 to 0.78 mu g/g (wet weight) (n = 183). To better interpret exposure data, relationships between blood and feather Hg concentrations were examined among age and sex classes. Blood and feather Hg concentrations from the same individuals were significantly correlated and varied geographically (r(2) ranged from 0.03 to 0.48). Blood and feather Hg correlated strongest in areas with the highest blood Kg levels, indicating a possible carryover of breeding season Hg that is depurated during winter remigial molt. Mean blood and feather Hg concentrations in males were significantly higher than concentrations in females for each region. The mean blood Hg concentration in adults was 10 times higher than that in juveniles, and feather Hg concentrations significantly increased over 1 to 4-year periods in recaptured individuals. Geographic stratification indicates a significant increasing regional trend in adult and juvenile blood Hg concentrations from west to east. This gradient resembles U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-modeled predictions of total anthropogenic Hg deposition across the United States. This gradient is dearest across regions. Within-region blood Hg concentrations in adults and juveniles across nine sites of one region, the Upper Great Lakes, were less influenced by variations in geographic Hg deposition than by hydrology and lake chemistry. Loons breeding on low-pH lakes in the Upper Great Lakes and in all lake types of northeastern North America are most at risk from Hg.

J	McInerny, MC; Cross, TK				McInerny, MC; Cross, TK			Effects of lake productivity, climate warming, and intraspecific density on growth and growth patterns of black crappie in southern Minnesota lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Growth and growth patterns of black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus) from a diverse set of 42 lakes in the southern half of Minnesota, and effects of lake productivity, climate warming, and intraspecific density on growth were determined First-year growth increments decreased with increasing mean depth and increased with increasing chlorophyll-a concentration until concentrations reached around 100 mu g/L. At concentrations above 100 mu g/L, first-year growth decreased with increasing chlorophyll-il concentration. The number of years needed to grow to 200 mm (QAGE) was lower in lakes with low (< 3.8 per lift) catch per lift (CPUE) of black crappie in gill nets set in summer. Second- and third-year growth increments explained 71% of the variation in QAGE among lakes, but first-year growth did not explain any additional variation. Black crappie with sigmoidal growth patterns (second- or third-year increments greater than or equal to first-year increments) reached 200 mm significantly faster than black crappie with nonsigmoidal growth (first-year growth increments were longest). Black crappie exhibited sigmoidal growth in lakes with low gill net CPUE of black crappie, and nonsigmoidal growth occurred in lakes with high gill net CPUE. Growth and growth patterns were unrelated to climate warming.																			0270-5060					JUN	1999	14	2					255	264		10.1080/02705060.1999.9663677	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1999.9663677													WOS:000080560700013

Water Balance for a Tropical Lake in the Volcanic Highlands: Lake Tana, Ethiopia	WATER												Lakes hold most of the freshwater resources in the world. Safeguarding these in a changing environment is a major challenge. The 3000 km(2) Lake Tana in the headwaters of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia is one of these lakes. It is situated in a zone destined for rapid development including hydropower and irrigation. Future lake management requires detailed knowledge of the water balance of Lake Tana. Since previous water balances varied greatly this paper takes a fresh look by calculating the inflow and losses of the lake. To improve the accuracy of the amount of precipitation falling on the lake, two new rainfall stations were installed in 2013. The Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation Version two (CHIRPS-v2) dataset was used to extend the data. After reviewing all the previous studies and together with our measurements, it was found that the period of 1990-1995 likely had the most accurate gauged discharge data. During some months in this period, the lake water balance was negative. Since the river inflow to the lake cannot be negative, water was either lost from the lake via the subsurface through faults, or the outflow measurements were systematically underestimated. Based on the evaporation rate of 1650 mm, we found that unaccounted loss was 0.6 km(3) a(-1), equivalent to 20 cm of water over the lake area each year. This implies the need for reliable rainfall data and improved river discharge measurements over a greater portion of the basin both entering and exiting the lake. Also, integrated hydrological and geologic investigations are needed for a better understanding of the unaccounted water losses and quantifying the amount of subsurface flow leaving the lake.					; Atanaw, Fasikaw/AGL-4262-2022; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020; Worqlul, Abeyou/I-1788-2019	Zimale, Fasikaw/0000-0001-9778-2712; wale worqlul, abeyou/0000-0002-7990-8446; Tilahun, Seifu/0000-0002-5219-4527; steenhuis, tammo/0000-0003-0508-9350														2073-4441				OCT	2020	12	10							2737	10.3390/w12102737	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102737													WOS:000585317500001
J	Changnon, D; Bigley, R				Changnon, D; Bigley, R			Fluctuations in US freezing rain days	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Freezing rain occurrences during a 50-year period, 1949/1950-1998/1999, derived from carefully examined records of 161 first-order stations distributed across the United States, were assessed for temporal fluctuations and trends. Classification of station fluctuations based on five 10-year periods revealed five unique distribution types in areas east of the Rockies. One of these five distributions, for stations located in the western Great Plains, experienced its greatest 10-year value at the end of the 50-year period. The other four regional distributions experienced their highest 10-year value in either of the first two 10-year periods. Nationally, the 10-year period when the greatest number of stations experienced their maximum value was 1949/1950-1958/1959, while the period when the greatest number of stations experienced their minimum value fell near the end of the 50-year record (1979/1980-1988/1989). The 50-year linear trends defined one region, the western Great Plains, with increasing values, while three areas of decreasing trend were identified; the Great Lakes, the eastern Ohio River valley, and southern New England. These analyses also indicate the need to examine and consider such time-space changes in the frequency of climate variables at various spatial scales when assessing weather risks and developing climate change scenarios.																			0165-0009					APR	2005	69	2-3					229	244		10.1007/s10584-005-3585-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-005-3585-8													WOS:000228882000003
J	Vergniolle, S; Métrich, N				Vergniolle, S.; Metrich, N.			An interpretative view of open-vent volcanoes	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Open-vent volcanoes are special systems where the dynamics of sustained magmatic processes can be thoroughly investigated and where new monitoring tools can be tested and applied. However, various aspects remain puzzling at open-vent volcanoes for which forecasting their behaviour can be an important challenge. Recent papers highlight the very rapid improvements in spaceborne instruments, data acquisition techniques, data treatment and modelling over the last decade and illustrate the fundamental contribution of long time-series data, either discontinuous or continuous, and the development of multiparameter studies. Here we provide an interpretative overview of the main characteristics of open-vent volcanoes on the basis of selected examples chosen to be representative of the diversity of their magma composition, their eruptive activity and their geodynamic context. We choose typical open-vent volcanoes (Stromboli, Yasur and Erebus), some of them hosting a lava lake (Erta 'Ale, Nyiragongo, Villarrica, Ambrym and Masaya), to those with vigourous activity, which are associated to a long-lasting eruption (Arenal, Fuego, Popocatepetl, Santiaguito). We briefly review their surface activity and report the values of SO2 flux and the derived magma supply rate with emphasis on the key results found on their behaviour. We show the key role of the magma viscosity and its implication on the degassing. We present the current models used to explain how an open-vent volcano could be maintained, such as by the simultaneous rise and fall of a degassing and degassed magma (bi-directional flow models) and the few thermal models at lava lakes and in the conduit. Finally, we discuss the sulphur evolution for three nearby volcanoes at the triple junction in Central America (Pacaya, Fuego, Santiaguito).

Smectite, kaolinite, halloysite-7 angstrom and opal-A occur in assemblages with alunite. Smectite represents a mechanical mixture between two (propylitic and acid-sulfate) alteration types. High amounts of high-field strength elements (HFSE) and rare earth elements (REE) were measured in acid-sulfate rocks. The Nb vs. Ta and Zr vs. Hf show a positive trend and a widely scattered relationships, suggesting a large fractionation during acid-sulfate alteration. Higher n-ary sumation REE amounts (up to 934.5 ppm) were found in clay-sulfate assemblages and lower n-ary sumation REE amounts in sinter (opal-A +/- sulfate, 169.05 ppm) than to fresh rocks (up to 751.2 ppm). The acid-sulfate rocks reveal a distinctive gull-wing chondrite-normalized pattern with a negative Eu anomaly and light- and heavy-REE "wings" similar to the gull-wing pattern of fresh rocks. The Eu/Eu* shows a large fractionation of acid sulfate rocks from 0.16 to 0.78 with respect to fresh trachyte products (0.10 to 0.38). Variation of (La/Sm)(N) and (La/Yb)(N) ratio show a large fractionation of light-REE and heavy-REE. The Y vs. Dy and Y vs. Ho show a very good positive correlation coefficient and a large Y fractionation in acid-sulfate rocks with respect to fresh rocks.

The temperature of most lakes in the dry climate zone and in the equatorial climatic zone varied from 17 to 31 degrees C and from 23 to 27 degrees C, respectively. LSWTs in the warm temperate and cold climatic zones were in the range of 20 to 27 degrees C and -0.6 and 17 degrees C, respectively. The average day time LSWT in the polar climate zone was -0.71 degrees C in the summer. Lakes in high latitude and in the Tibetan Plateau displayed low LSWT, ranging from -11 to 26 degrees C during the night time. Large spatial variations of diurnal temperature difference (DTD) were observed in lakes across Eurasia. However, variations in DTDs were small in lakes located in high latitude and in tropical rainforest regions. The shallow lakes showed a rapid response of LSWT to solar and atmospheric forcing, while in the large and deep lakes, that response was sluggish. Results of this study demonstrated the applicability of remote sensing and MODIS LST products to capture the spatial-temporal variability of LSWT across continental scales, in particular for the vast wilderness areas and protected environment in high latitude regions of the world. The approach can be used in future studies examining processes and factors controlling large scale variability of LSWT.

Here, we present the preliminary results focusing on the bathymetric survey and water quality measurements. The isobathic map shows that Nam Co is a high-altitude, deep lake where a flat and large basin lies in the central part with a water depth of more than 90 m. Water depth data from the northwestern bank areas of Nam Co provide unquestionable evidence of rising water levels in the last 3 decades because of the formation of two small islands that were still peninsulas in the 1970s. Water quality measurements taken at 19 stations during three summer field campaigns (2006, 2007 and 2008) covering almost all of the lake areas showed that the temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and electric conductivity of surface water are on average 11.43A degrees C, 9.21, 8.90 mg l(-1) and 1,851 mu S cm(-1), respectively. The surface water shows no obvious spatial variability among all the stations. Vertical fluctuations of profiles, however, display some differences in thermocline and related parameters, such as pH and dissolved oxygen. According to the vertical variations of water quality parameters, the water column in relatively deep lake areas of Nam Co could be divided into three layers with distinctly various features: the epilimnion is from the surface to about 18-20 m depth in which the parameters are homogeneous with higher temperature and abundant sunlight; the metalimnion ranged from 20-60 m where a thermocline develops; the deepest layer forms a cold and dark hypolimnion.					; Daut, Gerhard/AAO-1514-2021; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Daut, Gerhard/0000-0001-7414-1103; 													1439-8621					AUG	2009	10	2					149	158		10.1007/s10201-009-0266-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0266-8													WOS:000268017800009
J	Radin-Sabados, M				Radin-Sabados, Mirna			Representing quarantine on film: fearing the monster inside	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGLISH STUDIES												Fictional representations of contagion, that is epidemic or pandemic in film, mainly fall within the genres of fantasy, horror, or science fiction, while their narratives focus on fear and panic, on disturbance of the social equilibrium. Approaching the film interpretations of the subject from the perspective of biopolitics as it is understood by Giorgio Agamben, this paper explores how media products of the postmodern era, created several decades apart and originating from different productions and geopolitical circumstances, interpret the idea of isolation in quarantine as a means of questioning the nature of humanity. Variola Vera, a Yugoslav film from the 80s, produced in Eastern Europe at the peak of postmodernism is juxtaposed against the most recent To the Lake, a TV show produced in Russia and distributed on Netflix. As fictional representations of epidemics, they demonstrate a clear and consistent pattern in the portrayal of disease and quarantine, deploying tropes of the outbreak narrative in constructing the texts and relating it to the postmodern horror film. Before all, theyask the question "If one is not a human being, what is one? " when the social management of contagion is conceived spatially: as quarantine, as isolation.

Entrainment of fish eggs and larvae at an operating nuclear generating station using improved methodology. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Entrainment data collected from 7 December 2015 to 22 November 2016 at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station (DNGS) using automated sampling methodology are discussed in this article, including numbers of fish eggs and larvae entrained. We used a more robust sampling design than previously used in 2004 and 2006, which involved more frequent sampling over a longer, 12 month period. The design allowed collection of daily samples with a longer sampling duration and higher total sample volumes that reduced variability compared to previous studies with less robust sampling throughout a day. Our study resulted in the capture of deepwater sculpin and burbot that were not observed in previous entrainment studies. The maximum entrainment density for eggs was about 17 times higher than that for larvae. The entrainment of fish eggs was highest in the summer months (June and July) and did not vary diurnally. The highest entrainment rates for larvae occurred during the months of August and September, with higher densities entrained at night. We recommend the use of both increased sampling frequency and sampling volumes to characterize fish entrainment for water users in the Great Lakes watershed.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAY 25	2021	37	2					186	198		10.1080/10402381.2020.1843207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2020.1843207		DEC 2020											WOS:000599352100001

Here, we focus on the evolution of a stream-dominated fan in a tectonic depression of the Xining basin of China, laid down under a semi-arid climate in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP). The fan succession is composed of three facies associations, from bottom to top: (1) matrix to clast-supported, poorly sorted, planar cross-stratified to crudely stratified sheets of coarse-grained sediments; (2) horizontal laminated sand, laminated layers of reddish fine silt and yellow coarse silt with stacked mounds of sand; and (3) clay-rich deposits with incipient paleosols. The succession shows rapid sediment aggradation from high-energy to low-energy alluvial fans and finally to a floodplain. The dating results using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) method show that a gravelly, high-energy fan was deposited during MIS 6, after which a low-energy fan, mainly composed of sand and silt, was deposited and finally covered by flood loam during the MIS 6-5 transition and the warmer last interglacial. Stacked sand mounds are interpreted from their sediment structure and grain-size distribution as shrub-coppice dunes in low-energy fan deposits. They may be considered as a response to the interaction of alluvial and aeolian processes in a semi-arid environment.					wang, xianyan/ABO-8369-2022; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019; Lu, Huayu/NKQ-1462-2025	wang, xianyan/0000-0002-8281-5734; Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319													2571-550X					SEP	2018	1	2							16	10.3390/quat1020016	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat1020016													WOS:000481453200009

Rotational rock slides, rock fall and a rock avalanche affecting the coastal cliff are shallow surface expressions covering a larger rock mass instability that is bordered to the west by the Balliolbreen Fault. This structural feature is part of the Billefjorden Fault Zone and accommodated multi-phase deformation since Devonian time. Based on a comprehensive morpho-structural analysis, the mapped surface features and rock slope failures are explained by a compound rock slide model that reveals a litho-structural control on the type and mechanism of slope instability. The Balliolbreen Fault serves as an inherited zone of weakness that is reactivated as the rear rupture surface of the rock slide. In addition, favourably oriented bedding planes and pre-existing fault zones serve as prime conditioning factors for the compound rock slide. A postglacial age of at least 6 ka is derived from C-14 dated sediments of Garmaksla Lake, a perennial sag pond along the main scarp. Although the current state of activity of the compound rock slide is unclear, an increase of shallow slope instabilities is expected owing to climate warming.					; Torizin, Jewgenij/MXM-3625-2025	Kuhn, Dirk/0000-0003-1003-3722; 													1470-9236	2041-4803				MAY 8	2023	56	2							qjegh2022-069	10.1144/qjegh2022-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/qjegh2022-069		NOV 2022											WOS:000880155600001
J	Pfefferkorn, HW; Wang, J				Pfefferkorn, Hermann W.; Wang, Jun			Early permian coal-forming floras preserved as compressions from the Wuda District (Inner Mongolia, China)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Four different compression/impression floras are preserved in only 4.32 m to of the geologic section in the Early Permian Shanxi Formation of the Wuda District of Inner Mongolia, northwestern China. These floras represent four different plant communities and landscapes that followed each other in time. The oldest flora was rooted in sandy clay and initiated peat accumulation that lead to the formation of the lower coal seam. This seam is 230-cm thick and overlain by a 66-cm thick volcanic tuff that preserves a second different flora that grew on the peat at the time of the ash-fall. Standing stems and large plant parts are present. The upper part of the tuff is rooted by a single species of lycopsid (the third flora) again initiating peat accumulation. On top of this second seam of 120 cm thickness rests a roof-shale, deposited as mud in a shallow lake, the formation of which was responsible for the cessation of peat deposition. This fourth flora represents the plants growing around the lake on elastic substrate. Four different environments followed each other in this locality over a geologically short time span and each time conditions prevailed to preserve plant macrofossils. Three of these floras represent peat-forming plant communities of essentially the same time interval. This demonstrates the great variability of vegetation and landscapes in the tropical Cathaysian realm of the Late Paleozoic. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Energetic Carrying Capacity of Submersed Aquatic Vegetation in Semi-Permanent Wetlands Important to Waterfowl in the Upper Midwest	WETLANDS												Intensification of land use practices and climate change have resulted in extensive wetland loss and declines of native submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) species across North America. Limited by a lack of biomass and energy estimates for wetlands containing SAV, conservation planners currently are unable to accurately account for its energetic contribution in bioenergetics models for waterfowl and other waterbirds. Therefore, we estimated energetic carrying capacity of 21 semi-permanent wetlands containing SAV and identified as important stopover locations for migrating waterfowl and other waterbirds in the Midwest, USA during 2015-2017. Energy density of SAV ((x) over bar = 813 +/- 257 EUD/ha) was generally less than managed emergent wetlands, varied by National Wetland Inventory class, and had large annual (98-4873 Delta EUD/ha) and spatial variation (8-7971 EUD/ha). We developed a visual rapid assessment index (R-m(2) = 0.43) that may be useful to wetland managers or researchers to quickly index energy density from SAV in semi-permanent wetlands. Energetic carrying capacity of wetlands containing SAV will allow conservation planners to more precisely estimate energy supply on the landscape for waterfowl and evaluate trade-offs among alternative management strategies. Our results demonstrate negative effects of hydrologic connectivity on SAV communities in highly modified landscapes.

J	Blank, RR; Young, JA; Allen, FL				Blank, RR; Young, JA; Allen, FL			Aeolian dust in a saline playa environment, Nevada, USA	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Saline playas in north-western Nevada, U.S.A., remnants of pluvial periods of the Pleistocene, represent a tremendous source of unconsolidated sediments available for aeolian transport. This study investigated the transport of aqueous-soluble solutes in dust from July 1994 through June 1996 along a transect from a barren salt-encrusted playa surface (elevation = 1224 m), to a former pluvial lake beach (elevation = 1228 m), to a dune-mantled upland (elevation = 1248 m). The content of aqueous-soluble solutes in aeolian dust showed a significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) interaction with dust trap location (playa, beach, dune) and time of collection. Dust collectors on the playa surface generally contained significantly more aqueous-soluble solutes and had greater total flux of solutes than either the beach or the dune locations. The solute content of aeolian dust was usually higher, in some cases several orders of magnitude, than chat in the surface 5 cm of soil. Recent changes in playa hydrology may explain this result. Pulses of nitrate-rich dust, synchronous with spring emergence, and other nutrient additions via aeolian dust may have stimulated invasion of dune-mantled uplands by the weed Salsola paulsenii (barb-wire Russian thistle).

J	Yansa, CH				Yansa, CH			The timing and nature of Late Quaternary vegetation changes in the northern Great Plains, USA and Canada: a re-assessment of the spruce phase	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper revises the chronology for the northward migration of Picea glauca (white spruce) across the northern Great Plains, following the recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and reinterprets the species composition and Structure of the late-glacial vegetation on the basis of pollen and plant-macrofossil analysis. The timing of spruce migration is based on 26 C-14 ages obtained from Picea macrofossils. The date for the appearance of white spruce in southern South Dakota, USA, remains unchanged, 12,600 C-14 yr BP (ca 15,000 cal yr BP), but its arrival in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, by 10,300 14C yr BP (ca 12, 100 cal yr BP) is about 1500 years later than previously estimated based on an organic sediment date. Picea glauca thus migrated northwards at an average rate of 0.38 km/C-14 year (0.30 km/calendar year), significantly slower than the previously published rate of 2 km/C-14 year. White Spruce trees probably inhabited lake shorelines, whereas prairie, parkland, and boreal plants occupied both lowlands and uplands, forming an open white spruce parkland. This interpretation differs from a previous reconstruction of a boreal-type spruce forest and thus offers another paleoclimatic interpretation. Precipitation was probably low and Summer temperatures relatively mild, averaging about 19 degrees C. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	FIELD, MH; HUNTLEY, B; MULLER, H				FIELD, MH; HUNTLEY, B; MULLER, H			EEMIAN CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS OBSERVED IN A EUROPEAN POLLEN RECORD	NATURE												RECENT ice-core data from Greenland(1,2) suggest that the climate during the last interglacial period (the Eemian) was more unstable than that of the Holocene (about 10,000 years ago to the present), being characterized in particular by a series of cold episodes each lasting about 70 to 750 years. Subsequent analysis of a second Greenland ice core(3,4), however, failed to corroborate the details of these Eemian climate fluctuations, a result that may be attributable to the effects of ice flow(4). To resolve this discrepancy, it is imperative to seek alternative sources of information about the Eemian climate. Here we present climate reconstructions from pollen data from the annually laminated Eemian lake-sediment record at Bispingen(5) and from the Eemian and Holocene peat records at La Grande Pile(6). The former record indicates that an initially warm period of 2,900 yr was followed by cooling and a series oi colder episodes, one of which had winter temperatures comparable to those at the end of the preceding cold stage. The latter records show greater climate instability during the Eemian than the Holocene. These results are in broad agreement with those from the GRIP ice core, but contrast both with the GISP2 core(3,4) and with recent high-resolution marine records from the North Atlantic(7,8).																			0028-0836					OCT 27	1994	371	6500					779	783		10.1038/371779a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/371779a0													WOS:A1994PP01800053

The difficulties in interpreting proxy records for the middle, transitional stage of the Holocene aridification sequence, falling between the early wet stage and the late arid stage, have been created by the conjoint influence of two kinds of impact - climatic and anthropogenic. An unhelpful influence in this debate stems from Willis and Bennett's (1994) hypothesis of minimal human impact on the pre-Bronze Age landscapes of South East Europe. In this paper, two questions are posed: (1) what were the effects of the claimed global changes in Holocene climate at the regional and local scale in the ABC zones?; and (2) can we recognise human impact in these proxy records prior to the Bronze Age of our study regions? Following a discussion of general long-term climatic trends and RCCs (episodes of rapid climatic change), I base a discussion of the so-called 8200BP 'event' and pre-Bronze Age human impacts on a suite of 24 well-dated proxy records - mostly pollen sequences. The principal findings are that there is little evidence for impact from the 8200BP 'event' in these records, while there is substantial evidence for pre-Bronze Age human impacts on the landscapes of the Aegean, Balkan and Carpathian regions.

The catchment area, which contains over 50% wetlands, is located in a temperate region with no obvious point sources of mercury. Surface waters in the region had concentrations of total Hg ranging from 1.2 to 14.4 ng L-1 and MeHg from <0.04 to 1.4 ng L-1. MeHg concentrations were seasonally dependent, with the highest concentrations occurring in summer. Sediments/soils in the catchment had concentrations of total Hg ranging from 4.0 to 194 ng g(-1) and MeHg from <0.02 to 20.1 ng g(-1). The low concentrations of total Hg confirmed that this region is pristine as regards to mercury and has no geological enrichment of total Hg. The highest total Hg and MeHg concentrations in both sediment/soils and waters were found in bogs whereas the lowest concentrations typically occurred on the wetland plains. MeHg concentrations in bog and swamp sediments were correlated with the organic matter content (r = 0.942, P < 0.001). Acid volatile sulfide (AVS) measurements indicate that in most sediments AVS was greater than total Hg. Given the high reactivity of inorganic mercury and sulfide, this suggests that most of the particulate mercury in sediments is present as mercuric sulfide. The yield of MeHg from the catchment was estimated to be 3.2 mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and is higher than published rates measured in non-contaminated temperate catchments in the northern hemisphere. The higher yield was attributed to the generally warmer climatic conditions that favour net methylation and the relatively high rainfall (2-3 m yr(-1)) of the region, which supplies reactive inorganic mercury to the active zones of mercury methylation and also flushes MeHg from the catchment.

J	Wang, YL; Hua, ZL; Wang, L				Wang, Yulin; Hua, Zulin; Wang, Liang			Parameter Estimation of Water Quality Models Using an Improved Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization	WATER												Water quality models are of great importance for developing policies to control water pollution, with the model parameters playing a decisive role in the simulation results. It is necessary to introduce estimation through multi-objective parameters, which is often affected by noise in the data, into water quality models. This paper presents a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is based on the Mahalanobis distance operation, mechanism of cardinality preference and advection-diffusion operator. The Mahalanobis distance operation can effectively reduce the influence of noise in the data on model calibration. The mechanism of cardinality preference and the use of the advection-diffusion operator can prevent non-dominated solutions from falling into the local optimum. Four cases were used to test the proposed approach. The first two cases with true Pareto fronts show that this approach can accurately estimate the true Pareto front with a good distribution, even in the presence of noise. Furthermore, the application of the approach was tested by the O'Connor model and Crops of Engineers Integrated Compartment Water Quality Model. We show that our approach can produce satisfactory results for the multi-objective calibration of complex water quality models. In general, the proposed approach can provide accurate and efficient parameter estimation in water quality models.

Regrettably, numerous sections of the Yamuna River are heavily polluted, including many metropolitan areas like Prayagraj, Agra, Delhi etc. Water pollution with lead is a long-term problem. Rural and urban expansion, as well as rapid industrial development, are key sources of lead poisoning in lakes, rivers, groundwater, and other water sources as a result of increased population growth. Water samples were taken from each of the five sampling locations. Samples were taken throughout the course of a whole 2019 year, from January to December, with a 20-25-day break between them, with climate variation as a primary factor. Water sample were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) were used to quantify the content of lead (Pb) in water from the Yamuna in Delhi. When results were compared to the WHO permissible limits of Lead (Pb) and Nickel (Ni) in water, they were found to be greater. It can be observed that the concentration increases as the temperature rises and the humidity falls. Lead and nickel are both very poisonous in nature, and human and animal exposure to these heavy metals through water can cause chronic intoxication, which can be fatal.

When the winds were predominantly blowing from the west or south-west, epilimnetic waters were transported to the offshore bringing in hypolimnetic waters with low temperature (8-10 degrees C), dissolved oxygen (DO: 06 mg L-1) and pH (6-7) to the nearshore zones. During these events, vertical diffusivity coefficients decreased from 10(-2) m(2) s(-1) to values as low as similar to 10(-7) m(2) s(-1). In late summer, the coastal upwelling events in the nearshore waters lower the near bottom DO to hypoxic levels (DO < 2 mg L-1). Lakewide observations of DO and pH show that they are positively and linearly correlated while in the nearshore DO and pH experience spatial and temporal variability where upwelling events were developed, which were further assessed using a three-dimensional model. The model accuracy to reproduce offshore hypoxia was first assessed on a lake-wide basis using a coarse resolution model for a five-year period (2008-2012) and in nearshore waters using a higher resolution model for 2013. We use the model results to delineate the near bottom areas experiencing hypoxia at time scales longer than 48 h. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Zhang, YL; van Dijk, MA; Liu, ML; Zhu, GW; Qin, BQ				Zhang, Yunlin; van Dijk, Mark A.; Liu, Mingliang; Zhu, Guangwei; Qin, Boqiang			The contribution of phytoplankton degradation to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in eutrophic shallow lakes: Field and experimental evidence	WATER RESEARCH												Eight field campaigns in the eutrophic, shallow, Lake Taihu in the summers from 2005 to 2007, and a phytoplankton degradation experiment of 33 days, were carried out to determine the contribution of phytoplankton degradation to CDOM. Significant and positive correlations were found between the CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm [a(CDOM)(355)], normalized fluorescence emission (QSU) at 450 nm from excitation at 355 nm [F-n(355)], and the chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration for all eight field campaigns, which indicates that the decomposition and degradation of phytoplankton is an important source of CDOM. In the degradation experiment, the CDOM absorption coefficient increased as phytoplankton broke down during the first 12 days, showing the production of CDOM from phytoplankton. After 12 days, a(CDOM)(355) had increased from the initial value 0.41 +/- 0.03 m(-1) to 1.37 +/- 0.03 m(-1) (a 234% increase), and the Chla concentration decreased from the initial value of 349.1 +/- 11.2 mu g/L to 30.4 +/- 13.2 mu g/L (a 91.3% decrease). The mean daily production rate of CDOM from phytoplankton was 0.08 m(-1) for a(CDOM) (355). Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used to assess CDOM composition from EEM spectra, and four components were identified: a terrestrial-like humic component, two marine-like humic components, and a protein-like component. The rapid increase in marine-like humic fluorophores (C3 and C4) during the degradation experiment suggests that in situ production of CDOM plays an important role in the dynamics of CDOM. The field campaigns and experimental data in the present study show that phytoplankton can be one of the important CDOM producers in eutrophic shallow lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamics of the December 2020 Ash-Poor Plume Formed by Lava-Water Interaction at the Summit of Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												On 20 December 2020, after more than 2 years of quiescence at Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, renewed volcanic activity in the summit crater caused boiling of the water lake over a period of & SIM;90 min. The resulting water-rich, electrified plume rose to 11-13 km above sea level, which is among the highest plumes on record for Kilauea. Although conventional models would infer a high mass flux from explosive magma-water interaction, the plume was not associated with an infrasound signal indicative of "explosive " activity, nor did it produce a measurable ash-fall deposit. We use multisensor data to characterize lava-water interaction and plume generation during this opening phase of the 2020-21 eruption. Satellite, weather radar, and eyewitness observations revealed that the plume was rich in water vapor and hydrometeors but transported less ash than expected from its maximum height. Volcanic lightning flashes detected by ground-based cameras were confined to freezing altitudes of the upper cloud, suggesting that the ice formation drove the electrification of this plume. The low acoustic energy from lava-water interaction points to a weakly explosive style of hydrovolcanism. Heat transfer calculations show that the lava to water heat flux was sufficient to boil the lake within 90 min. Limited mixing of lava and water inhibited major steam explosions and fine fragmentation. Results from one-dimensional plume modeling suggest that the models may underpredict plume height due to overestimation of crosswind air-entrainment. Our findings shed light on an unusual style of volcanism in which weakly explosive lava-water interaction generated an outsized plume.					; Dufek, Josef/E-2190-2013	Van Eaton, Alexa/0000-0001-6646-4594; Parcheta, Carolyn/0000-0001-6556-4630; Smith, Adam/0000-0002-5250-0045; Solovitz, Stephen/0000-0001-7019-2958; Cahalan, Ryan/0000-0002-3322-0654; 														1525-2027				MAR	2023	24	3							e2022GC010718	10.1029/2022GC010718	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GC010718													WOS:000952443700001
J	Remington, S; Krusche, A; Richey, J				Remington, Sonya; Krusche, Alex; Richey, Jeff			Effects of DOM photochemistry on bacterial metabolism and CO2 evasion during falling water in a humic and a whitewater river in the Brazilian Amazon	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In the Amazon river system, the source of the large quantity of CO2 evading from river surfaces remains unidentified. Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) is a promising candidate. Few studies in the Amazon river system, and river systems in general, have attempted to quantify the contribution of these specific photoproducts to CO2 evasion. We conducted photochemical degradation and C-14 addition experiments to measure the rate of production and the impact on bacterial metabolism, respectively, in the black water Rio Negro and in the white water Rio Solimes during low water. We found statistically significant production of both photoproducts in the Rio Negro and none in Rio Solimes. We also found that two photochemically produced LMWOAs-acetic and formic acid-may play a significant role in bacterial metabolism in both rivers. Based on our experimental results, we estimate that photochemically produced CO2, acetic acid and formic acid alone contribute to only 0.5% of the CO2 evading from the Rio Negro. Due to our experimental set-up, analytical methods and time of sampling, we caution that our estimate is very conservative. More extensive research is needed before drawing conclusions on the contribution of photochemistry to CO2 evasion from river surfaces of the Amazon basin.

J	Herold, M; Lohmann, G				Herold, Marcus; Lohmann, Gerrit			Eemian tropical and subtropical African moisture transport: an isotope modelling study	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												During the last interglacial insolation maximum (Eemian, MIS 5e) the tropical and subtropical African hydrological cycle was enhanced during boreal summer months. The climate anomalies are examined with a General Circulation Model (ECHAM4) that is equipped with a module for the direct simulation of O-18 and deuterium ((H2O)-O-18 and HDO, respectively) in all components of the hydrological cycle. A mechanism is proposed to explain the physical processes that lead to the modelled anomalies. Differential surface heating due to anomalies in orbital insolation forcing induce a zonal flow which results in enhanced moisture advection and precipitation. Increased cloud cover reduces incoming short wave radiation and induces a cooling between 10 degrees N and 20 degrees N. The isotopic composition of rainfall at these latitudes is therefore significantly altered. Increased amount of precipitation and stronger advection of moisture from the Atlantic result in isotopically more depleted rainfall in the Eemian East African subtropics compared to pre-industrial climate. The East-West gradient of the isotopic rainfall composition reverses in the Eemian simulation towards depleted values in the east, compared to more depleted western African rainfall in the pre-industrial simulation. The modelled re-distribution of delta O-18 and delta D is the result of a change in the forcing of the zonal flow anomaly. We conclude that the orbitally induced forcing for African monsoon maxima extends further eastward over the continent and leaves a distinct isotopic signal that can be tested against proxy archives, such as lake sediment cores from the Ethiopian region.

Little is known about the spatial and seasonal occurrence of cyanotoxins in Lake Ontario and other lakes and ponds within its watershed. Within the embayments, ponds, rivers, creeks, shoreside, and nearshore and offshore sites of Lake Ontario, microcystin-LR concentrations were low in May, increased through the summer, and reached a peak in September before decreasing in October. Considerable variability in microcystin-LR concentrations existed between and within habitat types within the Lake Ontario ecosystem. In general, the average microcystin-LIR concentration was two orders of magnitude lower in embayment (mean=0.084 mu g/L), river (mean=0.020 mu g/L, and shoreside (mean 0.052 mu g/L) sites compared to upland lakes and ponds (mean = 1.136 mu g/L). Concentrations in the nearshore sites (30-m depth) and offshore sites ( 100-m depth) were another order of magnitude lower (mean=0.006 mu g/L) than in the creek/river, bay/pond, and shoreside habitats. Only 0.3% (2 of 581) of the samples taken in Lake Ontario coastal Waters exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) Drinking Water Guideline of 1 mu g microcystin/L for humans. In contrast, 20.4% (20 of 98) of the samples taken at upland lakes and ponds within the watershed of Lake Ontario exceeded WHO Guidelines. No significant relationship between nitrate and microcystin-LR concentrations was observed in Lake Ontario even though a significant positive relationship existed between phosphorus and phycocyanin and microsystin-LR concentrations. At all upland lake site (Conesus Lake) in the Ontario watershed, the development of a littoral Microcystis Population was not observed despite high nutrient loading (P and N) into the nearshore zone, well-developed nearshore populations of filamentous Spirogyra and Zygnema, the occurrence of Dreissena spp., and the known Occurrence of Microcystis and microcystin production in the pelagic waters of Conesus Lake.

Modelling the impacts of water level fluctuations and predation by cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) on the population dynamics of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) in Haweswater, UK	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2005	Advances in Limnology				9th International Symposium on Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	JUL 21-AUG 27, 2005	Olsztyn, POLAND					A population model incorporating egg mortality induced by falls in water levels has successfully simulated the general pattern in abundance, inferred from entrapment records between 1973 and 2003, of the whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) population of Haweswater, U.K. However, during the 1990s when the water level regime became more benign, the model predicted a slight upward trend in whitefish abundance but that revealed by entrapment records and hydroacoustic surveys was downwards. During the same period, a breeding colony of cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo L.) became established at the lake. Data derived from extensive field observations of feeding cormorants in 1997 were used to quantify this new source of whitefish mortality and incorporate it into the population model as a function of cormorant breeding colony size. With this refinement, the population model captured the observed whitefish decline of the 1990s and predicted that without management this source of mortality will drive the whitefish population to extinction in the near future. The model also predicted that with post-1997 frequencies of water level impacts of 0% or 30%, the whitefish population will persist only if cormorant impacts are reduced to no more than 40% or 20%, respectively, of that of 1997.

The study was undertaken in a 2-week period in late summer in NE Poland in a single year, thereby, eliminating seasonal and between-year variation in parasite burdens. A total of 139 Clethrionomys glareolus (bank vole) were sampled from 3 forest sites of similar habitat quality. Total species richness was 11 (6 nematodes and 5 cestodes) with 85.6% of the voles carrying at least I species and an overall mean species richness of 1.4. At the component community level, the fewest species of helminths were recorded from site 2 (n = 6, compared with 9 at each of the other sites), but site 3 had the lowest Berger-Parker Dominance Index and the highest Simpson's Index of Diversity. At the infracommunity level, site 3 had the highest mean no. of helminth species/vole, the highest mean Brillouin's Index of Diversity but the lowest mean no. of helminths/vole. Voles from sites 1 and 3 differed in the nematodes that were most common (site 1, Heligmosomum mixtum - 95% ; ite 3, Heligmosomoides glareoli - 79.3 %). At site 2 no species exceeded 50% but prevalence of Syphacia petrusewiezi was higher than at the other sites. The prevalence of cestodes was too low to test reliably (12.9 %), but the highest prevalence of adult cestodes was recorded at site 1 (22.5%, compared with 4.9 and 1.7%, for sites 2 and 3 respectively). Host sex did not influence infection, but mean species richness increased with age. The different sites were responsible for most of the variation in our data, and the intrinsic factors (sex and age) were less important in shaping the component community structure of helminths, We conclude that even locations in relative close proximity to one another (13-25 km), selected on the basis of similar habitat quality, have rodent populations that differ in their helminth parasite communities, although for reasons other than the factors quantified in the present studs,.					; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Bray, Daniel/H-4890-2012	Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Bray, Daniel/0000-0001-9914-2356; 													0031-1820	1469-8161				OCT	2001	123		4				401	414		10.1017/S0031182001008605	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182001008605								11676372					WOS:000171637400009

High concentrations of chlorophyll c and fucoxanthin were present at all locations, indicating significant diatom densities. chlorophyll b was detected at all sites. At one station the other green algal pigments were also present; here green algae contributed more to chlorophyll a concentrations than diatoms, as estimated by using pigment ratios and microscopic observations. At another location chlorophyll b was associated with a high concentration of diadinoxanthin, indicating an abundance of euglenoids. This indicates that chemotaxonomy can be powerful tool in microphytobenthos studies since enumeration of living cells are difficult as many algae are attached to sediment particles (epipsammic algae). Ways of diagenesis, carotenoid degradation and the role of grazing are briefly mentioned. Phaeophorbide a-like pigments were the most significant chlorophyll a degradation products, with concentrations up to 110-mu-g.g-1 dry weight sediment, i.e. 10 times the chlorophyll a concentration. Some taxonomic estimations, based on pigments ratios, and their limits, are discussed.

P. adspersus is a more halotolerant species than previously thought and can survive and breed up to a salinity of 55 g/L and probably higher. A significant positive correlation was found between the number and biomass of the prawns and the seagrass Ruppia shoot density. The spring temperature increase from 5.5 to 24 degrees C was accompanied by a significant increase in the prawn number (p = 0.001). In the males and females, the spatial heterogeneity of the distribution of prawns significantly (p = 0.005) negatively correlated with the abundance of prawns. In the period from 2018 to 2021, the area of Ruppia cover and the prawn abundance in the lake decreased, and a significant correlation was found between those changes. High salinity, judging by our data, can reduce the production potential of the species, but the absence of predators in Lake Moynaki allowed the prawns to reach a higher abundance than was observed in other habitats. P. adspersus can be successfully cultivated in hypersaline waters with a salinity up to 55 g/L as a perspective object for Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture. The development of aquaculture in hypersaline waters may help to save freshwater resources, and the development of aquaculture in brines formed during the desalination of seawater will make it more economically viable to obtain freshwater from seawater.

J	Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE				Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE			Polychlorinated biphenyls in Chicago precipitation: Enhanced wet deposition to near-shore Lake Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To determine if elevated levels of atmospheric contaminants in urban areas enhance atmospheric deposition to adjacent surface waters, precipitation was sampled at three stations along a transect from Chicago, IL, across southern Lake Michigan. Rainwater was collected during several storms in July 1994 and January 1995 in southern Chicago aboard the R/V Lake Guardian positioned 15 km east of downtown Chicago and at a rural site along the southeastern shore of the lake as part of the study Atmospheric Exchange Over Cakes and Oceans (AEOLOS). Total PCB concentrations in Chicago precipitation ranged from 4.1 ng/L (January 19, 1995) to 189 ng/L (July 21, 1994) and were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the measured regional background concentrations. Concentrations of PCBs in urban precipitation were dominated by particle-bound congeners, implying PCB enrichment in rainwater due to efficient scavenging of highly contaminated particulate matter from the urban atmosphere. PCB levels in precipitation falling over southern Lake Michigan were from two to as much as 400 times greater than the measured regional background concentration, indicating that the ''urban plume'' of Chicago increases atmospheric deposition of contaminants to Lake Michigan over spatial scales of tens of kilometers. Enriched urban precipitation extending out over Lake Michigan provides 50-400% greater PCB wet deposition loadings than background precipitation.

The NRC terminates in the Qaidam Basin and feeds tail salt lakes. The river-groundwater system (freshwater) and the terminal salt lakes display high concentrations of B and Li, ranking the Qaidam Basin as a world-class mineral system. However, the source, pathway, and enrichment mechanism of these elements remain unclear. In this study, the B and Li isotopes from rivers and groundwater from mountain to basin were used to trace their origin and evolution processes. B and Li are found in high concentrations even in river and groundwater with low total dissolved solids (TDS), with average concentrations tens to hundreds times higher than those of natural freshwater systems. The observed B and Li isotopic footprints are significantly depleted in heavy isotopes in the NRC if compared to other geological systems dominated by natural weathering processes. Following the confluence of one of the main tributaries of the Hongshui River (HSR) sourced from the EKM, the B and Li concentrations increase sharply, while the delta 11B and delta 7Li values gradually decrease. This study indicates that the mechanism accounting for the B and Li endowment of the river-groundwater-salt lake system is mainly related to the Li-B fertility of the sources (deep fluids and country rocks), favorable tectonic conduits for water circulation, and high evaporation rates. Specifically, the deep fluids upwelling is responsible for the sourcing of B and Li. These fluids are then discharged to the river and groundwater through geothermal springs developing along deep faults or within volcanic craters. In this frame, the river and groundwaters act as carriers, and input B and Li into the lake basin. Ultimately, B and Li undergo an evaporation-mediated fractionation ending with the formation of brines and eventually accounting for the formation of the world-class Li-B salt lake deposits.

H.; Ndzangou, Sabary Omer; Richer-Lafleche, Marc			Compositional vegetation changes and increased red spruce abundance during the Little Ice Age in a sugar maple forest of north-eastern North America	PLANT ECOLOGY												In north-eastern North America, the recent red spruce decline has been linked to atmospheric pollution, notably acid rain, although climate was also advocated as a potential factor. A high resolution lake sediment pollen stratigraphy was obtained to elucidate long-term trends in tree-species abundance in a sugar maple-yellow birch forest. The reconstructed history (similar to 250-1996 A.D.) showed a steady increase of red spruce after 1300 A.D., with a peak between 1600 and 1900 A.D. followed by a strong decline in the last century, while sugar maple and yellow birch experienced an opposite trend. Red spruce abundance reached its apogee during the cool Little Ice Age (LIA) and decreased abruptly when annual temperature in the region increased by 2 A degrees C in the last 125 years. American Beech was much more abundant in the forest before the LIA, typifying a sugar maple-American beech forest as the dominant forest type during the Late Holocene. Our results suggest that climate warming has played an important role in the current red spruce decline, the latter having been initiated well before acidic depositions reached deleterious potential effects on red spruce.

Biology, Status, and Management of the Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri were historically distributed in the Yellowstone River drainage (Montana and Wyoming) and the Snake River drainage (Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and probably Washington). Individual populations evolved distinct life history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities have resulted in a substantial decline (42% of the historical range is currently occupied; 28% is occupied by core [genetically unaltered] populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2) habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3) climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire, winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic) and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1) preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated populations may be greater in the short term, current management is focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats; however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events.					; Gresswell, Robert/ABH-8944-2020	Gresswell, Robert/0000-0003-0063-855X; 													0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	5					782	812		10.1080/02755947.2011.608980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.608980													WOS:000296983500002

The measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios vary between 0.71256 and 0.71567 compared to 0.7092 in average seawater and c.0.7098 in rainwater. The highest value was measured in a sample of suspended sediment particles from the glacial lake located below Erdalsbreen, and the lowest value was measured in suspended sediment particles in the river draining Vetledalsbreen. An intermediate value was measured in the sandur area below the confluence of Stordalselva and Vetledalselva. The measured difference in 87Sr/86Sr ratio between the uppermost and lowermost locations of the investigated part of the drainage basin was 1.75 x 10-3. This is significant and sufficient for application in future estimates of weathering rates. The age of water in the glacial lake at the outlet of Erdalsbreen was determined as being in the range 1110 +/- 30 to 1430 +/- 45 y BP.					; Beylich, Achim A./JUV-1673-2023	Beylich, Achim A./0000-0003-3382-5394; 													0029-1951	1502-5292					2009	63	2					132	134	PII 912440128	10.1080/00291950902907819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00291950902907819													WOS:000267098100006

Overview of the Diversity of Extremely Saline Soils from a Semi-Arid Region Using 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing: A Case Study of the Sebkhas in Algerian High Plateaus	MICROBIOLOGY												Sebkha is an Arabic word referring to a closed ground depression temporarily occupied by a salt lake. Very few studies on the composition of the microbial communities from these ecosystems in the Algerian High Plateaus have been carried out. To fill this gap, four sebkhas in the eastern High Plateaus of two different Algerian provinces were sampled, in the winter 2020. We employed the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to understand the distribution and diversity of prokaryotic communities in these hypersaline soils. Our results indicate that the overall archaeal community in the hypersaline soils was dominated by members of the class Halobacteria followed by members of the yet uncultured phyla Hadarchaeota and Nanohaloarchaeota. Among the bacterial classes, Alphaproteobacteria was by far the most frequently recovered from all samples, whereas the Cyanobacteria phylum dominated in one of the sebkhas. It was evident from data that Halorubrum and Halapricum were the most abundant archaeal genera, whilst Rhodovibrio and Limimonas predominated among Bacteria, and these were present in all samples. Remarkably, the most abundant archaeal OTUs belonged to the families Haloarculaceae (16.6%) and Halobacteriaceae (16.3%).

Based on morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics the isolate was determined to belong to the genus Streptomyces. The phylogenetic tree based on its nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1428 nt) with representative strains showed that the strain consistently falls into a distinct phyletic line together with Streptomyces glaucosporus DSM 41689(T) (98.22% similarity) and a subclade consisting of Streptomyces atacamensis DSM 42065(T) (98.40 %), Streptomyces radiopugnans R97 DSM 41901(T) (98.27%), Streptomyces fenghuangensis GIMN4.003(T) (98.33%), Streptomyces nanhaiensis DSM 41926(T) (98.13%), Streptomyces megasporus NBRC 14749(T) (97.37%) and Streptomyces macrosporus NBRC 14748(T) (98.22%). However, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain RC 1831(T) and phylogenetically related strains. Streptomyces atacamensis DSM 42065(T) (28.75 +/- 3.25 %) and Streptomyces glaucosporus DSM 41689(T) (15 +/- 2.40%) were significantly lower than the 70% threshold value for delineation of genomic species. Furthermore, the isolate could be distinguished phenotypically on the basis of physiological, morphological and biochemical differences from its closest phylogenetic neighbours and other related reference strains. Strain RC 18311 is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces barkulensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is RC 1831(T) (=JCM 18754(T)=DSM 42082(T)).

J	Heggen, MP; Birks, HH; Anderson, NJ				Heggen, Marianne Presthus; Birks, Hilary H.; Anderson, N. John			Long-term ecosystem dynamics of a small lake and its catchment in west Greenland	HOLOCENE												We investigated the interplay between climate and the Holocene ecological development of a small low-Arctic lake and its catchment. The remains of terrestrial and aquatic oribatid mites, plant macrofossils, and other invertebrates in a sediment core from Lake SS16 in west Greenland revealed its palaeoecological history over the last 6950 years. Betula nana immigrated into Dryas fell-field and open grassland around 6600 cal.yr BP and then expanded to dominate dwarf-shrub heath that clothed the catchment for 4800 years. Like other lakes in Greenland, the mesotrophic SS16 became progressively oligotrophic as a consequence of nutrient depletion and reduced runoff from the maturing catchment vegetation. Abrupt declines of Lepidurus arcticus and Daphnia probably reflect the immigration of fish around 6300 cal. yr BP. After c. 2000 cal. yr BP, catchment heathland declined with Neoglacial cooling and reduced precipitation and was replaced by open Dryas grassland vegetation and bare soil. Lake productivity also decreased. The major early-Holocene catchment changes pre-date the aquatic changes, revealing decoupling of ecological responses to climate. In the late Holocene, however, climate change was the predominant driver in both lake and catchment. This multiproxy study shows the valuable contribution made by oribatid mites in the reconstruction of direct processes (e. g. precipitation: evaporation ratio), indirect processes (e. g. nutrient sequestration by maturing tundra vegetation, immigration of taxa), and internal feedbacks (e. g. trophic interactions) that controlled ecosystem development in the past.

Population Structure and Diet of Burbot (Lota lota) in Small Streams Near the Southern Extent of the Species' Range	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We studied the population structure and diet of burbot (Lota Iota) listed as state-endangered and inhabiting small streams near the southern extent of the species' North American range. The size structure was truncated, with a mean total length of 191 mm and range of 84-356 mm. A subsample of individuals (n=32) were euthanized, and age estimates from otoliths revealed surprisingly short lifespans (maximum age of five years). An age-length key was then used to assign ages proportionately to the larger sample, and 80% were estimated to have been age 2 and age 3. Burbot stomach contents were removed with gastric lavage from 120 individuals during summer sampling that occurred at four-hour intervals for 24 h. Burbot specialized on Ephemeroptera, and consumed a variety of other invertebrate prey; surprisingly, fish were only found in three individuals. While similar to other reports of burbot in small streams, (e.g. small body sizes, earlier maturation, short-lifespan, invertebrate-centered diet) the population demographics were considerably different from 'typical' burbot populations occurring in lakes, large rivers, and reservoirs.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2010	25	1					49	58		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664356													WOS:000275293500006
J	SEIP, KL				SEIP, KL			THE ECOSYSTEM OF A MESOTROPHIC LAKE .2. INTERACTIONS AMONG NUTRIENT LOAD, RIVER FLOW, AND EPILIMNION DEPTH	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The management variables which primarily affect phytoplankton biomass (as chl-a) in Lake Mjosa, Norway, are total phosphorus loading (TP) and the timing and volume of water through flow (by active storage reservoirs). The response of the lake to changes in these factors is studied using a simulation model of the lake ecosystem. Chl-a responses from both observed data and the simulated results are extracted by multiple regression. Results show that decreasing TP load decreases chl-a, but less at low TP levels (< 10 mg TP . m-3). There is also a certain time period for peak river flow which gives the least yield of chl-a per unit TP. This time period occurs in early summer (i.e., around June 10) if the total phosphorus load is low, and later if the load is high. Both observations and simulation results show that a high water flow increases chl-a at low epilimnion depths (< 15 m), but that the same high water flow decreases chl-a when epilimnion is deep.																			1015-1621						1991	53	2-3					263	272		10.1007/BF00877062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877062													WOS:A1991FZ65600006
J	RAGOTZKIE, RA; LIKENS, GE				RAGOTZKIE, RA; LIKENS, GE			THE HEAT BALANCE OF 2 ANTARCTIC LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The thermal structures of Lakes Vanda and Bonney in Victoria Land, Antarctica, are examined and the heat balance of Lake Vanda evaluated. Both lakes are permanently ice-covered and have high salt concentrations that increase with depth. The deep water of Lake Vanda is very warm (25C), while that of Lake Bonney is cold (-2.8C). Lake Vanda gains heat from solar radiation and by conduction from the bottom. All the heat gained is accounted for by melting of the under-surface of the ice and evaporation from the upper surface. Changes in sensible heat storage in the water in both lakes are extremely small. Lake Vanda has four layers of constant density water that are maintained by convective circulation driven by heating from below. The existence of a strong circulation in the thickest of these layers is demonstrated by a radioactive tracer experiment that revealed a horizontal current of 1 cm/sec at 20 m and some vertical mixing. No evidence of convective activity was found in Lake Bonney. Hypotheses put forth by other workers to explain the warm water of Lake Vanda by solar heating alone and by subsurface advection from thermal springs are considered and rejected.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1964	9	3					412	425		10.4319/lo.1964.9.3.0412	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1964.9.3.0412													WOS:A1964WU66000015

At mid-point, the depth of the lake was measured 46.54 in and the Secchi visibility was 2.37 m. Water temperature from 1-10 in depth gradient showed slight stratification in the lake which varied from 27.0 -22.4 degrees C at 1.00 pm. pH at the different depths ranged from 7.8 -9.1, conductivity from 75 -80 mu S/cm and TDS from 39 - 42 mg/l. Alkalinity ranged from 0.8 - 1.24 meq/l and DO from 0.61 - 11.39 mg/l. A total of 40 species of phytoplank-ton were recorded from the lake of which 21 belonged to Chlorophyceae followed by Cynaophyceae (5), Bacillariophyceae (4), Cryptophyceae (4), Euglenophyceae (3), Dinophyceae (2) and Chrysophyceae (I). Bloom by Synnechocystis salina Wisl was observed at 10 in depth. Water temperature correlated negatively and significantly with depth. Phytoplankton biomass as chl a correlated positively with phytoplankton density and water depth. The former variable showed negative correlation with and water temperature.

Quantitative high-resolution, regionally-synthesized palaeoclimatic reconstructions as well as simulations, and numerical analyses of their relationships with various fine-scale, numerical agro-ecological, social-economic, and geo-political historical records during the period of China's history, are presented here for NC. We utilize pollen data together with climate modeling to reconstruct and simulate decadal- to centennial-scale variations in precipitation or temperature for NC during the last 2200 years (-200-2000 AD). We find an overall cyclic-pattern (wet/warm or dry/cold) in the precipitation and temperature anomalies on centennial- to millennial-scale that can be likely considered as a representative for the entire NC by comparison with other related climatic records. We suggest that solar activity may play a key role in driving the climatic fluctuations in NC during the last 22 centuries, with its quasi similar to 100, 50, 23, or 22-year periodicity clearly identified in our climatic reconstructions. We employ variation partitioning and redundancy analysis to quantify the independent effects of climatic factors on accounting for the total variation of 17 fine-grained numerical Chinese historical records. We quantitatively illustrate that precipitation (67.4%) may have been more important than temperature (32.5%) in causing the overall agro-ecological and macro-geopolitical shifts in imperial China with NC as the central ruling region and an agricultural heartland over the last 2200 years.

Three Phages from a Boreal Lake during Ice Cover Infecting Xylophilus, Caulobacter, and Polaromonas Species	VIRUSES-BASEL												Although the important role of microbes in freshwater is well understood, studies on phage-host systems in such environments during ice cover are completely lacking. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of three new bacteriophages infecting Xylophilus sp., Caudobacter sp., and Polaromonas sp. from freshwater samples taken under the ice cover of Lake Konnevesi, Finland. Lumi, Kuura, and Tiera bacteriophages have tailed icosahedral virions and double-stranded DNA. Lumi is a siphophage with a genome of 80,496 bp, and Kuura and Tiera are podophages, and their genomes are 43,205 and 45,327 bp in length, resembling viruses in the class Caudoviricetes. Their host ranges were very limited among the winter-isolated bacterial strains from Konnevesi, each infecting only their own hosts. They can infect efficiently at 4 degrees C, showing that they are adapted to living in lake water under ice cover. Analysis of the viral genome sequences showed that a significant number of the gene products of each virus are unique, indicating that there is unexplored viral diversity in freshwaters. To our knowledge, Lumi and Tiera are the first phages isolated on the Xylophilus sp. and Polaromonas sp. strains, allowing their exploitation in further studies of freshwater bacterial-phage interactions.

In this study, we dated paleoshoreline sediments around the lake using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and radiocarbon dating, then explored the forces that drove Holocene lake level variations. We found that: (1) OSL/ IRSL ages are consistent with geomorphic sequences and some extant cosmogenic and U/Th shoreline ages. However, inorganic evaporite crust 14 C ages are much older than corresponding OSL/IRSL ages due to varying lake reservoir effects and should be used with caution; (2) The highest lake levels of Longmu Co (similar to 160-145 m above present) lasted from similar to 12.8 to similar to 11.3 ka. Two periods of abrupt lake level declines occurred at similar to 11.3 and similar to 7.4 ka (lake level dropped similar to 44 and similar to 45 m, respectively), with a gradual regression of similar to 18 m between these two intervals. The lake expanded moderately from similar to 7 to 5.5 ka, then declined once more after similar to 5.5 ka, with this regression accelerating during the last similar to 1.5 ka; (3) The deglacial lake level transgression was likely due to glacier melt waters. The Indian Summer Monsoon reached the Longmu Co watershed and brought precipitation during the early Holocene. Middle to late Holocene lake regression was caused by the retreat of the monsoon and consequent environmental deterioration.

Very low levels of chlorophyll a ranging between mean values of 0.29 and 1.8-mu-m l-1 were recorded. The phytoplankton was largely made up of coloured flagellates, including single species of Chlamydomonas, Ochromonas and Peridinium, which occurred in low concentrations (23.8 x 10(2)-47.3 x 10(2) l-1). Heterotrophic colourless flagellates, including Paraphysomonas vestita, were also relatively sparse (2.1 x 10(2)-21.3 x 10(2) l-1). Ciliated protozoans were particularly poorly represented. Only three species occurred reaching densities of approximately 100 l-1, and among them the mixotrophic species Strombidium viride was the most common. A single species of heliozoan Actinosphaerium and relatively large numbers of naked amoebae were the sarcodine representatives. The protistan community and the bacteria were concentrated into microbial consortia associated with flocs of particulate organic matter probably derived from the benthic algal mat. Of the two microcrustacean zooplankters recorded from the lake only Daphniopsis studeri was found breeding in the plankton in very low numbers. The behavioural and physiological adaptations of the organisms inhabiting this extremely oligotrophic environment are discussed.																			0142-7873					NOV	1991	13	6					1137	1149		10.1093/plankt/13.6.1137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.6.1137													WOS:A1991GM24500001
J	Wu, Q; Xia, XH; Li, XH; Mou, XL				Wu, Qiong; Xia, Xinghui; Li, Xiaohan; Mou, Xinli			Impacts of meteorological variations on urban lake water quality: a sensitivity analysis for 12 urban lakes with different trophic states	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Response of 12 urban lakes with different trophic states in Beijing to variations of meteorological factors was studied in this research. Monthly water quality parameters, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen, and water temperature, were analyzed from 2009 to 2011. Results indicated that TN in the urban lakes did not exhibit significant response to meteorological variations owing to relatively lower TN concentration in the urban soil. For the highly eutrophic lakes, TP, chlorophyll a, COD, and BOD were positively correlated with precipitation, and negatively correlated with wind speed (p < 0.05). Chlorophyll a showed significant positive correlation with TP and temperature. Moreover, the abrupt increase of TP occurred in spring, which was associated with higher temperature induced internal phosphorus loading. On average, temperature/precipitation and wind speed/sunshine duration contributed to 10.7-43.8 and 8.3-19.2 % of the variations in water quality. In contrast, lakes with mesotrophication/light eutrophication did not show significant sensitivity to meteorological variations owing to their better buffer capacity and regulation effect of algae growth. Beijing is undergoing increased temperature and heavy rainfall frequency as well as decreased wind speed during the past five decades; the above results infer that water quality of most urban lakes of Beijing is becoming worse under this climate change trend. This study suggested that urban lakes with different trophic states will respond differently to global climate change, and highly eutrophic lakes might face big challenges of water quality deterioration and algae bloom.					xia, xinghui/A-9116-2008	Xia, Xinghui/0000-0002-8663-6346													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2014	76	3					339	351		10.1007/s00027-014-0339-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-014-0339-6													WOS:000337789600003

Response of δD values of sedimentary n-alkanes to variations in source water isotope signals and climate proxies at lake Nam Co, Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					24th Himalaya-Karakorum-Tibet Workshop	AUG 11-14, 2009	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China				Compound-specific delta D values of sedimentary n-alkanes from Nam Co were compared with oxygen isotope values from three different ice cores of the Tibetan Plateau and other climate proxies including temperature and solar radiation. This enabled estimation of the importance of source water and of environmental factors at the ecosystem scale on variations of the isotopic composition of sedimentary n-alkanes. The ice core records from Dasuopu, Puruogangri and Rongbuk glacier of the past 1000 years recording the source water isotopes show a continuous deuterium enrichment indicating a warming trend or decreased precipitation. Sedimentary n-alkane delta D values also represent the same general tendency to enrichment in heavier isotopes. However, the correlation to the delta O-18 values derived from the ice record is very weak. The delta D values of n-alkanes agree with known climatic events such as the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period showing depleted and enriched delta D values, respectively. The delta D values of the n-alkanes were best related to environmental drivers including temperature and solar radiation. The results suggest that delta D values of sedimentary n-alkanes mainly record evapotranspiration and relative humidity that strongly influence delta D values at the plant level, while variability of the source signal is less important.

Quantifying Karenia brevis bloom severity and respiratory irritation impact along the shoreline of Southwest Florida	PLOS ONE												Nearly all annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (K. brevis) pose a serious threat to coastal Southwest Florida. These blooms discolor water, kill fish and marine mammals, contaminate shellfish, cause mild to severe respiratory irritation, and discourage tourism and recreational activities, leading to significant health and economic impacts in affected communities. Despite these issues, we still lack standard measures suitable for assessing bloom severity or for evaluating the efficacy of modeling efforts simulating bloom initiation and intensity. In this study, historical cell count observations along the southwest Florida shoreline from 1953 to 2019 were used to develop monthly and annual bloom severity indices (BSI). Similarly, respiratory irritation observations routinely reported in Sarasota and Manatee Counties from 2006 to 2019 were used to construct a respiratory irritation index (RI). Both BSI and RI consider spatial extent and temporal evolution of the bloom, and can be updated routinely and used as objective criteria to aid future socioeconomic and scientific studies of K. brevis. These indices can also be used to help managers and decision makers both evaluate the risks along the coast during events and design systems to better respond to and mitigate bloom impacts. Before 1995, sampling was done largely in response to reports of discolored water, fish kills, or respiratory irritation. During this time-frame, lack of sampling during the fall, when blooms typically occur, generally coincided with periods of more frequent-than-usual offshore winds. Consequently, some blooms may have been undetected or under-sampled. As a result, the BSIs before 1995 were likely underestimated and cannot be viewed as accurately as those after 1995. Anomalies in the frequency of onshore wind can also largely account for the discrepancies between BSI and RI during the period from 2006 to 2019. These findings highlighted the importance of onshore wind anomalies when predicting respiratory irritation impacts along beaches.

High chlorophyll a concentration in a low nutrient context: discussions in a subtropical lake dominated by Cyanobacteria	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Temporal variability in some water quality parameters can play an important role in determining the presence and abundance of primary producers, and consequently in the trophic state and other characteristics and uses of lake ecosystems. In this sense, the present study aimed at understanding temporal dynamics of some trophic relevant water quality parameters in different time scales and their correlation and influence in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in a shallow subtropical coastal lake. Peri Lake is located in Florianopolis island in Southern Brazil and samples were taken monthly between March 2007 and February 2013. The lake showed low dissolved nutrients concentration, especially phosphorus (P) (median dissolved P: 2.0 mu g L-1) and high chlorophyll a (median: 20.8 mu g L-1) concentration. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration varied broadly, with a median of 672.8 mu g L-1, and total P (TP) concentration was low (median: 13.5 mu g L-1). A seasonal pattern of variation concerning dissolved and total P and chlorophyll a concentration was observed, associated mainly with temperature and wind speeds, but no clear pattern was observed for nitrogen (N) fractions. Significant differences were observed in different years for some parameters, with higher chlorophyll a and lower N concentration in the last three years sampled. The lake was considered potentially P limited during the majority of the study period and a positive correlation was found between chlorophyll a and total and dissolved P concentration. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) was apparently controlled by water temperature and P availability (TN:TP ratio and dissolved P). Water transparency (as Secchi depth) was strongly and negatively influenced by chlorophyll a concentration. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii abilities to compete for P and light seem to be important factors determining its success and dominance in this low P coastal ecosystem. The fluctuating P supply, probably associated to sediment resuspension by wind in this shallow waterbody, is an advantageous factor for cyanobacteria and has an important role in chlorophyll a dynamics. Thus, high chlorophyll a concentration in this subtropical lake seems to be related to the P-limited condition, shallowness and low water column transparency, which are probably favouring the dominance of C. raciborskii, especially in higher summer temperatures, and leading to high chlorophyll a concentration even in a low dissolved nutrient environment.

Both projects are located in the Lake Tahoe area, Nevada, United States. Testing results indicated that the mechanical properties were significantly higher in SR28 cored samples than the ones in SR431. It was found that the SR28 pieces have fewer air voids, while the SR431 samples have higher water absorption and hydraulic conductivity, and the SR28 samples show fare better performance against repeated freezing and thawing cycles than the SR431 ones. scanning electron microscope pictures of crack surfaces in cores taken from SR28 indicate that the cement binder phase has been largely retained. However, in the coring sample of SR431, needle-shaped residues can be seen within the cement binder phase and an abundance of precipitated micro-sized crystalized particles can be observed. On a micrometer scale, the mu CT examination reveals that the porosity of SR28 samples is significantly less than that of SR431. The analyzing results give a clue to demonstrate the durability of pervious concrete pavement can be attributed to the construction quality control, maintenance activity, or the weather and locations of the field sites.

J	Ding, FL; Mao, ZY				Ding, Falong; Mao, Zeyu			Observation and Analysis of Water Temperature in Ice-Covered Shallow Lake: Case Study in Qinghuahu Lake	WATER												Water temperature serves as a key environmental factor of lakes and the most basic parameter for analyzing the thermal conditions of a water body. Based on the observation and analysis of the water temperature of Qinghuahu Lake in the Heilongjiang Province of China, this paper analyzed the variation trend of the heat flux, effective thermal diffusivity of the icebound water, and revealed the temporal and spatial variation law of the water temperature and the transfer law beneath the ice on a shallow lake in a cold region. The results suggested a noticeable difference existing in the distribution of water temperature beneath the ice during different periods of ice coverage. During the third period, the water temperature vertically comprised three discrete layers, each of which remained unchanged in thickness despite the alternation of day and night. Sediment-water heat flux and water-ice heat flux both remained positive values throughout the freezing duration, averaging about 3.8-4.1 W/m(2) and 9.8-10.3 W/m(2), respectively. The calculated thermal diffusivity in late winter was larger than molecular, and the time-averaged values increased first and then decreased with water depth, reaching a maximum at a relative depth of 0.5. This research is expected to provide a reference for studies on the water environment of icebound shallow lakes or ponds in cold regions.						, Falong/0000-0001-5399-7666														2073-4441				NOV	2021	13	21							3139	10.3390/w13213139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13213139													WOS:000718991600001

Forty-seven Year Changes in Vegetation at the Apostle Islands: Effects of Deer on the Forest Understory	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) have been labeled a keystone herbivore in forests of the midwestern United States, particularly as deer have increased over the past century due to forest fragmentation, reduction of natural predators, reduced hunting, and mild winters. Deer browsing in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore has had a pronounced effect on formerly large continuous patches of reproductive Canada yew (Taxus canadensis Marshall). In order to compare understory plant communities in 2005 to those at sites sampled in 1958, we resurveyed 32 forest sites on islands that remained free of deer throughout this period, on islands that retained deer, and on islands that gained or lost deer. Multivariate analyses reveal that deer have strong effects on the type of change in the forest understory. Plant communities on sites with long-term deer pressure are becoming increasingly different from those on sites that have never had deer. Four new understory species were detected at these sites, two other species increased by more than 20%, while eight decreased by more than 20%. While grasses and sedges were favored on sites that maintained or gained deer, perennial forbs declined conspicuously on these sites. The recovery of understories on islands where deer were removed suggests that such actions can effectively restore suitable habitat conditions for certain species sensitive to deer herbivory.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2009	29	2					167	176		10.3375/043.029.0209	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.029.0209													WOS:000265563000009

Basal-ice features comprise (1) ice facies and facies groupings similar to those from the basal ice layers of contemporary glaciers and ice sheets in Alaska, Greenland and Iceland; (2) ice crystal fabrics similar to those from basal ice in Antarctica and ice-cored moraines on Axel Heiberg Island, Canada; and (3) a thaw or erosional unconformity along the top of the MI-IS, buried by glacigenic or aeolian sediments. Intrasedimental ice consists of pore ice and segregated ice formed within Pleistocene sands deposited before glacial overriding. The co-existence of basal and intrasedimental ice within the MI-IS records their occurrence within the basal ice layer of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Stagnation of the ice sheet and melt-out of till from the ice surface allowed burial and preservation of the basal ice layer on a regional scale. The widespread occurrence of supraglacial melt-out till with clast fabrics similar to those in the underlying ice suggests that such till can be well preserved during partial thaw of a continental ice sheet in lowlands underlain by continuous permafrost.

However, traditional insitu investigations often fall short of capturing the spatial-temporal variations of phytoplankton community structure and biomass on large scales. This study introduces a novel approach that harnesses the power of machine learning models coupled with Sentinel-2 satellite data to predict phytoplankton shifting and chlorophyll-a (Chla) in three large shallow lakes in central China from 2016 to 2021. We employed an array of machine learning algorithms, including the extreme gradient boosting method (XGBoost), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) to retrieve Chla and phytoplankton groups clustered by hierarchical cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index (HCA). The influences of environmental factors, including meteorology and nutrients, on phytoplankton dynamics were then explored. Our results identified four distinct phytoplankton groups, each exhibiting unique structural characteristics according to the HCA. The RF and XGBoost, utilizing top-of-atmosphere reflectance, provided the most accurate estimations of phytoplankton shifting and Chla, respectively. The red edge-red ratio emerged as a key variable in both models, underlining the significance of red edge bands in phytoplankton monitoring. We mapped spatialtemporal patterns of phytoplankton group occurrence and average Chla concentration across the three lakes. Our findings indicated that eutrophication extended periods of cyanobacteria domination and algal blooms, particularly in bays and nearshore areas. Redundancy analysis and classification and regression tree model highlighted temperature as a significant driver of phytoplankton shifting, while nutrient levels exhibited stronger influences on Chla. Our study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning models with Sentinel-2 data to enhance the monitoring and prediction of phytoplankton dynamics in shallow lakes. This approach offers valuable insights for the early detection of algal blooms and informed management strategies, contributing to the preservation and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems.

Latitudinal gradient in the ovary weight of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus in Lake Biwa, Japan	ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The local difference in the ovary weight of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus was investigated in Lake Biwa, Japan. Fish samples were collected from four sites in May 2010 before the onset of spawning. Analytical results indicated that the ovary weights decreased significantly with latitude. The ratios of ovary weight to the body weight of fish collected at the lowest-latitude site frequently exceeded 10%, whereas those at the highest-latitude site were always below 5.79%. A latitudinal decrease in the ovary weight was obviously responsible for the higher body weights of fish in the south basin of the lake than those in the north basin, since the ovary-removed body weights of fish tended to increase with latitude. As the water temperature of Lake Biwa normally starts to increase in spring from lower latitudes, the latitudinal gradient in the ovary weight of bluegill appeared to be owing to the difference in the local temperature. Results of this study suggest that bluegill can adjust their reproductive activity by sensitively responding to the local temperature condition. This attribute can be regarded as one of the strategies of the bluegill to optimise the adaptive success to various environments, probably contributing to the rapid expansion of the fish after introduction to the lake.

Tempestite frequency curves: a key to Late Ordovician and Early Silurian subsidence, sea-level change, and orbital forcing in the Anticosti foreland basin, Quebec, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Following partial closure of the northern Iapetus Ocean along the Newfoundland segment of the St. Lawrence Promontory, subsidence along the Anticosti Platform was influenced by residual thermal subsidence, renewed tectonic loading by thrust sheets to the south, and sediment loading. Basement subsidence, calculated by removing the effects of sediment loading, was between 2 and 5 cm/ka in the Caradocian, increasing to 8.6 cm/ka in the Pusgillian and Cautleyan, and reaching a maximum of 17.7 cm/ka in the Rawtheyan, during deposition of the Princeton Lake and Vaureal Formations. A marked decline in subsidence, beginning in the Hirnantian and continuing into the Early Silurian, may reflect decoupling of thrust loads to the south, although a further stage of thrust loading may have occurred in the Aeronian during deposition of the lower part of the Jupiter Formation. Storm frequency curves, produced using tempestite abundance, thickness, and grain size through more than a kilometre of carbonate strata on Anticosti Island, allow recognition of long period, 3rd-order trends. These are in part similar to local sea-level trends deduced from direct interpretation of sedimentary structures, but depart significantly from paleontological-based sea-level curves. Shorter period 4th-order cycles appear to be related to orbital eccentricity with periods of 100 and 400 ka. These may reflect periods with falling sea levels, increasing storm activity, or enhanced sediment flux to the middle and outer shelf.

One set of experimental populations (P1 and P2) contained as broodstock equal numbers of adult NLMB and FLMB, whereas the other set (H1 and H2) initially contained equal numbers of adults of both reciprocal F1 hybrids and both pure subspecies. Each year-class produced experimentally were sampled and individuals analyzed genetically to determine their percentage. Initially, much of the YOY production in P1 and P2 was composed of small FI MB that did not survive winter well; once naturally produced F1 hybrids entered the breeding pool, most offspring were F(x) hybrids, and the population became heavily introgressed. In H1 and H2 introgression began with the production of the first year-class. Within each year-class NLMB produced in all ponds were significantly larger than all other genotypes, but it appears likely that after only a few generations, production of pure NLMB ceases, all individuals being F(x) hybrids. Results illustrate the potential negative impacts of introducing FLMB or hybrids between it and NLMB into waters within or contiguous to the native range of the northern subspecies.																			0706-652X						1991	48			1			58	65		10.1139/f91-304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-304													WOS:A1991HB54300007

Since this region has been heavily polluted by acid mine drainage from opencast lignite mines, time- and cost-efficient investigation methods are required to obtain comprehensive information on aquifers. In summer 2021, BGR carried out a helicopter-borne electromagnetic (HEM) survey with its helicopter and a RESOLVE system covering an area of about 250 km2. While current surface water levels are derived from in-flight altitude measurements, the spatial resistivity distribution shows indications for the water table in the entire survey area. Apparent resistivities agree very well with water resistivities measured in larger lakes, where the distance to the lakeshores outreaches the system's footprint. While groundwater sampling requires observation wells, we use HEM results to close the gaps between the sparsely distributed wells. The analysis of groundwater samples shows that groundwater EC correlates with dissolved iron (Fe2+) and sulfate (SO42-) content. HEM resistivities help to approximate groundwater EC, and further Fe2+ and SO42- contents at the observation wells, and to estimate these within the mining area where oxidative pyrite weathering processes dominate other contamination processes.																				2073-4441				MAR 28	2025	17	7							1000	10.3390/w17071000	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17071000													WOS:001463572000001

To address these issues, we introduce a framework combining machine learning, numerical modeling, and remote sensing imagery to predict coastal water turbidity, a key water quality proxy. This approach was tested in the Great Lakes region, specifically Cleveland Harbor, Lake Erie. We trained models using observed and synthetic data from 3D numerical models and tested them against in situ and remote sensing data from PlanetLabs' Dove satellites. High-resolution (HR) data improved prediction accuracy, with RMSE values of 0.154 and 0.146 log10(FNU) and R2 values of 0.92 and 0.93 for validation and test datasets, respectively. Our study highlights the importance of unified turbidity measures for data comparability. The machine learning model demonstrated skill in predicting turbidity through transfer learning, indicating applicability in diverse, data-scarce regions. This approach can enhance decision support systems for coastal environments by providing accurate, timely predictions of water quality variables. Our methodology offers robust strategies for turbidity and water quality monitoring and holds significant potential for improving input data quality for numerical models and developing predictive models from remote sensing data.

To determine the utility of analyzing these samples and for cases in which DNA was recovered from submerged bulletproof vest parts, we evaluated the time necessary to degrade the blood and, subsequently, DNA on bulletproof vests. In a second experiment, also based on cases, blood was diluted in water from a kitchen sink pipe and incubated at room temperature for different times. Subsequently, DNA quality was assessed. In a parallel experiment, hair roots were incubated in spring water for different time periods. This study demonstrates that after one week of immersion of the bulletproof vest parts in a canal only one sample from more than 100 samples gave a partial genetic profile. No genetic profile were obtained for the 99 other samples. After one month immersion and despite the finding that blood remained detectable on bulletproof vest parts, no genetic profile was obtained for all samples using the classical STR approach. For longer immersion times, no genetic profiles were obtained. In sink pipe water, an incubation time of 72 h (h) was necessary before significant blood degradation occurred. Nevertheless, high inter-sample variability was observed. This high variability may be explained by the variability of water composition coming from nine different sink pipes.

Before c. 14.5 ka cal BP, warming and relatively moist conditions free from fire, facilitated the expansion of high Andean Polylepis woodland. Fire onset at c. 14.5.ka cal BP, quickly transformed the local vegetation and the woodlands became restricted to areas protected from fire. A major increase in burning, c. 10.1-6.4 ka cal BP removed Polylepis woodland locally and this coincided with a region-wide Holocene dry event (HOE) which caused falling lake levels and allowed fire intensification. A decline in burning at c. 6.4 ka cal BP and an increase in marsh-woodland (Alnus) marked the termination of the HDE and a return to wetter conditions. As well as recording the environmental history of local vegetation dynamics, long-distance pollen transport provides evidence of changes in the Yungas montane forests, highlighting their sensitivity to climate and burning regimes. Simultaneous adjustments in both Andean and Yungas montane taxa suggest that vegetation dynamics in the two environments are linked to a common climatic driver. There is no evidence to indicate that human activity had any impact on the local landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we find that tholeiitic rocks in the Kilauea Iki (KI) lava lake, Hawai'i, show progressively lighter Ni isotopic compositions with increasing magmatic differentiation, whereas calc-alkaline rocks from the thick Kamchatka arc (30-45 km), located at the convergent boundary of the Eurasian and Pacific plates show increasing Ni isotope values as MgO and Ni decrease. Forty-three global intermediate-felsic continental igneous rocks analyzed in this study display large Ni isotopic variations, with the Eoarchean samples having light Ni isotopic compositions that fall in the trend defined by the KI lavas, and the post-Eoarchean samples showing systematically heavier Ni isotopic compositions overlapping those of Kamchatka arc rocks. The isotopic dichotomy results from the crystallization of isotopically heavy magnetite during low-pressure differentiation of KI lavas, whereas the participation of sulfide separation that removes isotopically light Ni during high-pressure differentiation of magmas traversing thick continental crust. Combined with Rhyolite-MELTS and sulfur concentration at sulfide saturation simulations, we demonstrate that the Ni isotope fractionation during magmatic differentiation is mainly controlled by the tempo of magnetite crystallization and sulfide formation, which is a function of pressure, oxygen fugacity, and water activity. High-pressure calc-alkaline differentiation usually suppresses magnetite crystallization while stabilizing sulfide, leading to heavy Ni isotopic compositions for the evolved magmas, significantly deviating from the low-pressure fractionation trend seen in the KI lavas. Ni isotopes can be used in the future as a tracer of magmatic differentiation and processes of continent formation and differentiation.

A total of 73 different bird species were detected, from 34 families in 18 orders, of which c. 30% were waterbirds. Fifty species potentially breed at the IBA, whilst 23 occur only in winter or during migration. One - the European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur - is of global conservation concern, classed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red List of threatened species, and 14 are threatened at the national level. The results suggest that these natural lakes are of great importance for birds. Although the Adiyaman-Golbasi Lakes IBA was declared a Nature Park in 2008, illegal hunting, harvesting and reed burning are still major problems in the area. An innovative management approach is required to the protect the habitat, water quality, avian diversity and water flow dynamics in the catchment, in order to protect these natural wetlands and ensure that human activity does not impinge on the integrity of the site.

A review of genetic evaluation tools for conservation and management of North American sturgeons: roles, benefits, and limitations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd Annual Conference on Sturgeons of the North American Chapter of the World-Sturgeon-Conservation-Society	AUG 31-SEP 02, 2010	World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC), Bozeman, MT		World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC)			This paper summarizes one component of a sturgeon conservation genetics workshop held in conjunction with the Third Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the World Sturgeon Conservation Society from 31 August through 3 September, 2010, at Chico Springs, Montana, USA. The purpose of this portion of the workshop was to foster interdisciplinary communication, help characterize sturgeon conservation and management issues and challenges, and provide the context and rationale for selecting and employing appropriate genetic investigations for sturgeon programs. Specifically, this paper: (i) provides some guiding principles for sturgeon managers and conservationists considering genetic investigations; (ii) provides a general overview of relevant analytical genetic metrics and techniques, including complications from polyploidy; and (iii) provides several examples of sturgeon conservation and management programs currently using genetic analyses for various purposes. Numerous analytical techniques are currently available to address a range of individual and population genetic issues, including population structure and status, origins and relatedness of individual fish and populations, family identity and contribution to year class, species identity and hybridization, forensic cases, and the design and evaluation of conservation and management actions. Rather than focusing on mechanistic or quantitative aspects of available genetic analyses, this paper provides a general context, overview, and several empirical examples to guide the selection of genetic analyses for sturgeon programs. We also provide information from published studies involving procedural and quantitative aspects of sturgeon genetic analyses for further reference.

We evaluate the effect of increasing temperature (climate warming) on Al concentrations in four strongly acidified lakes in the Bohemian Forest, Southwestern Czech Republic, over a 17-yr period (1984-2001). Pronounced decreases in atmospheric S and N deposition resulted mainly in a sharp monotonic decrease in lake water concentration of total Al (-0.49 to -1.38 mumol L-1 yr(-1)). Residuals from the linear relationship between total Al concentrations and the sum of strong acid anions were inversely correlated with air temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation index. An increase in the average annual air temperature of +1.27 +/- 0.49degreesC between 1984 and 2001 was correlated with decreases in toxic Al3+ and explained, on average, 13% of the total Al decrease in three lakes and 11% of the Al3+ decrease in Cerne Lake. The inverse relationship between Al solubility and temperature caused lower Al mobilization in soil horizons and/or enhanced precipitation of Al in the lakes at higher temperature but otherwise similar conditions. As a consequence, the recent period of warmer years and mild winters significantly contributed to the trend of decreasing Al in lakes recovering from acidification.

Chinook salmon were larger than coho salmon and contained higher concentrations of the 78 PCB congeners we detected. There were no differences between male and female chinook or coho salmon in size or their PCB concentrations. Among individual fish, we found little evidence for a relationship between congener concentrations and percent lipid; however, congener concentrations did show a generally positive relationship with salmon size. Fish and macroinvertebrate congener concentrations are clearly related, and PCB congeners biomagnify similar to 20-30-fold as they flow from macroinvertebtates, two trophic levels below salmon, to the salmon. Slopes of regressions of salmonid congener concentrations on macroinvertebrate congener concentrations within homologs indicated that the degree of biomagnification generally increased with the degree of congener chlorination, although this pattern was much stronger for Mysis than for Diporeia. Log K-ow and categorical variables for coplanar and "toxic" PCBs were not significant additional model terms, indicating that bioaccumulation of PCB congeners was not statistically related to these physicochemical attributes of the PCBs. The distribution of homologue PCBs shifts from a distinct predominance of hexachlorobiphenyls in macroinvertebrates to pentachlorobiphenyls and hexachlorobiphenyls in the salmon.					; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; 													0013-936X					MAR 1	2001	35	5					856	862		10.1021/es001558+	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es001558+								11351527					WOS:000167296400028

The precise age of the impact that generated the craters is still disputed. We investigated the basal sediment section from the main crater lake, Kaali jarv, consisting of crushed and in-washed dolomite diamiction. AMS dating of terrestrial macrofossils from these sediment layers places the age of the impact at 1690-1510 B.C. The age is about 1000 years older than revealed from the impact marker-horizon in a contemporaneous peat sequence 6 km northwest of the Kaali crater. The pollen, diatom and chemical data suggest the instant formation of a shallow hard-water lake environment in the main crater depression after the impact, and a rapid post-impact sedimentation of crushed dolomite dust. Archaeological evidence on the crater slopes points to human activity around 700-200 B.C., indicating that the crater ring wall was inhabited by Bronze Age people soon after the impact event, and the structure of the main crater is mimicked in nearby archaeological sites.

Although satellite data have been adopted to observe surface POC content, the previous remote sensing results cannot indicate water column-integrated POC storage in shallow eutrophic lakes with vertically nonuniform POC profiles. Based on 272 in-situ POC profiles collected from 19 shallow eutrophic lakes in China's Yangtze-Huai Plain (YHP), this study developed a novel process-oriented method to derive water column-integrated POC storage from OLCI/Sentinel-3A satellite data. The method included three critical steps: remotely estimating surface POC contents, identifying POC profile types (uniform, exponential decay, or power decay) through a binary decision tree, and parameterizing POC profiles using surface POC concentrations. The developed algorithms showed a bias of -25.79% for in-situ match-ups from 15 lakes (N = 88). The POC in the eutrophic lakes was mainly produced by phytoplankton (R2 = 0.87). As a result, the surface POC content pre-sented a unimodal peak in summer. However, in addition to air temperature regulations (0.52 - 68.53%), the water level also showed apparent effects on increasing POC storage, with relative contributions of 29.29 - 95.51% for the six largest lakes. Therefore, multisource satellite data are needed to derive POC storage in global eutrophic lakes remotely. This study is the first attempt to three-dimensionally observe lake POC contents from space and is important for understanding the carbon cycle in shallow eutrophic lakes.

Statistical techniques like analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster analysis, and regression analysis applied to datasets revealed spatiotemporal variations. ANOVA and Tukey's box plot was applied and resulting F values showed the significance of observed variation of each parameter at 5% level of significance in which some parameters do not change significantly. The higher positive and negative relationship among various analyzed water quality parameters were described by general linear regression model (P < 0.0001). The study of physicochemical parameters signify that the quality of its water substantially declines while moving downstream. The water quality sites were classified into significant clusters (clusters I and II) by cluster analysis. Cluster I (sites I and II) is illustrated by similar and better water quality whereas cluster II (sites II, IV, and V) is considered to be of moderately reduced water quality, thereby reflecting the different physicochemical characteristics and quality class. The results from water quality index (WQI) validate that water of the Dagwan stream falls within the excellent to very good category of water quality class. While comparing the results with WHO standards, the water quality was in permissible limits. The escalating level of pollution from upstream to downstream sites indicated slight anthropogenic stress in the downstream areas of the Dagwan stream.

(swamp paperbark) and their implications for the rehabilitation of coastal wetlands	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Swamp paperbark, Melaleuca ericifolia Sm., is a small, clonal tree that occupies fresh- and brackish- water wetlands across south-eastern Australia. Seeds collected from Dowd Morass, a secondary-salinised Ramsar-listed wetland of the Gippsland Lakes region in eastern Victoria, showed very low viability (< 6%), with less than 50% of the seeds germinating even under ideal laboratory conditions. Greatest germination occurred with surface-sown seeds, germinated in darkness at a mean temperature of 20 degrees C and salinity < 2gL(-1). At 20 degrees C, maximum germination occurred at a salinity of 1gL(-1); germination fell rapidly at a near constant rate with increasing salinity. Lower temperatures, while moderating the inhibitory effects of salinity, markedly reduced germination; higher temperatures increased the inhibitory effects of salinity and light and reduced overall germination rates. Seeds subjected to brief inundation with saline water germinated rapidly if flushed by, and subsequently grown under, freshwater conditions. Specific timing of management interventions, particularly manipulations of water regime to control salinity regimes, are required if germination of M. ericifolia on the landscape scale is to be successful. Even so, the low overall viability of the seeds would present difficulties to large-scale, seed-based rehabilitation efforts.

Teeth were sectioned to allow identification of lead exposure in utero and in early childhood. Blood lead levels in the children ranged from 10 to 42 mug/dL and remained elevated for a number of years. For most children, only a small contribution to tooth lead can be attributed to gasoline and paint sources. In one child with a blood lead concentration of 19.7 mug/dL, paint could account for about 45% of lead in her blood. Comparison of isotopic ratios of tooth lead levels with those from vacuum cleaner dust, dust-fall accumulation, surface wipes, ceiling (attic) dust, and an estimation of the smelter emissions indicates that from approximately 55 to 100% of lead could be derived from the smelter. For a blood sample from another child, > 90% of lead could be derived from the smelter. We found varying amounts of in utero-derived lead in the teeth. Despite the contaminated environment and high blood lead concentrations in the children, the levels of lead in the teeth are surprisingly low compared with those measured in children from other lead mining and smelting communities.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				JAN	2004	112	1					52	60		10.1289/ehp.6465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.6465								14698931					WOS:000187914500040

THE APPLICATION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE BALKHASH LAKE (KAZAKHSTAN)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Balkhash Lake is a unique natural water body with a gradient of the total content of dissolved salts along its longitudinal axis and the increased level of toxic pollutions. To assess the spatial distribution of environmental factors along the Balkhash Lake surface, methods of bioindication and statistical mapping were used. An assessment of the overall level of toxic pollution was carried out using the Water Ecosystem State Index (WEST). Phytoplankton has been used to assess the ecological state of the Balkhash Lake in the summer of 2004. A total of 92 species were found in the algal communities, with prevalence of Chlorophyta in the western, fresher water part, and Bacillariophyta in the eastern, brackish part. Mapping showed a positive relationship between the species richness in algal Divisions and macrophytes. Changes in the proportion of indicator species within the composition of phytoplankton reflected the spatial gradient of depth, TDS, pH-values, organic pollution. According to bioindication data, the waters of the Balkhash Lake are moderately polluted, water quality class III. The WESI index calculation revealed the effect of the total toxic pollution on the phytoplankton of the Western Balkhash The spatial distribution of the WESI index showed that in the zone the influence of river flow has stimulating effect of biogenic elements on phytoplankton but was partially leveled by the increased level of toxic pollution.					; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019; Krupa, Elena/I-7537-2019	Krupa, Elena/0000-0001-9401-0258; Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2018	16	3					2089	2111		10.15666/aeer/1603_20892111	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1603_20892111													WOS:000435780500001

Three laminated lithofacies (LF) have been differentiated in the Early Permian Fengcheng Formation, NW Junggar Basin: an alginite-poor, dolomite-lean, and argillaceous-rich lithofacies deposited during high lake level stages (LF-A), an alginite-moderate, dolomite moderate, and evaporite-present lithofacies deposited during low lake level stages (LF-B), and an alginite-dense, dolomite-rich and reedmergnerite (NaBSi3O8)-rich lithofacies deposited during periods of intense hydrothermal input (LF-C). Depositional environments influenced subsequent diagenetic pathways of the three laminated lithofacies. In the shallow-water LF-B sediments, extensive evaporite crystallization, dissolution and subsequent calcification or dolomitization occurred during eodiagenesis. The deep-water LF-A sediments underwent slight eodiagenetic modifications, but developed abundant calcite-filling sub-horizontal fractures during moderate inversion and uplift in mesodiagenetic regime. With increasing depth of burial, the previous vugs-filling calcite and dolomite were preserved well or only slightly replaced by reedmergnerite in the LF-A and LF-B sediments, but intensely replaced by reedmergnerite in the LF-C sediments during mesodiagenesis. The reedmergnerite enrichment processes in the LF-C sediments were closely related to organic matter production and thermal evolution. Algae blooms induced by spring input functioned as an important media in sinking hydrothermal boron from the not very concentrated waters. Later degradation and thermal evolution of alginite released boron and organic acids into interstitial waters, which caused carbonate dissolution and promoted reedmergnerite formation. The formation of reedmergnerite during mesodiagenesis restrained silicification process of carbonate minerals in ancient volcanic-related alkaline lake deposits.y																			0264-8172	1873-4073				JAN	2021	123								104780	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104780													WOS:000598618600001

Lake Macrophyte Nutrient Index of standing waters in Serbia (LIMNIS)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The aim of this study was to derive a Macrophyte Nutrient Index for standing waters in Serbia, based on the LEAFPACS method and to correlate it against existing Lake Typology. A single data matrix of 46 species and 1463 sample quadrats was compiled from two datasets: a revised phytocenological database given according to Braun-Blanquet Cover Abundance Scale and a database of sample quadrats collected during the summer months of 2009, 2010 and 2011 at 31 lakes in Serbia. The nutrient indices (MSI) for 46 lake hydrophytes were calculated using the Reprediction Algorithm on N-Ellenberg's values. A Macrophyte Nutrient Index (LIMNIS) was calculated as the weighted average of MSI values for Serbian lakes. Correlation between rescaled MSI and original N-values was strong (0.82), and the same applies to the root-mean-square error value (0.75). Moderate LIMNIS values were derived for meso-oligotrophic lakes, as well as for eutrophic swamps and fens of the Danube floodplain. In the same manner, lakes classified as eutrophic showed the relatively higher LIMNIS values, and those recognised as potential conservation resources were characterised by moderate or low LIMNIS scores. Median LIMNIS values of six Lake Groups differed by less than one unit, which confirmed the similarity of the previously given Lake Types. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we show that the central Cascade arc, USA, exhibits systematic spatial covariation of topography and hydrology that are linked to aging volcanic bedrock, suggesting systematic controls on landscape evolution. At the Cascade crest, a locus of Quaternary volcanism, water circulates deeply through the upper similar to 1 km of crust but transitions to shallow and dominantly horizontal flow as rocks age away from the arc front. We argue that this spatial pattern reflects a temporal state shift in the deep Critical Zone. Chemical weathering at depth, surface particulate deposition, and tectonic forcing drive landscapes away from an initial state with minimal topographic dissection, large vertical hydraulic conductivity, abundant lakes, and muted hydrographs toward a state of deep fluvial dissection, small vertical hydraulic conductivity, few lakes, and flashy hydrographs. This state shift has major implications for regional water resources. Drill hole temperature profiles imply at least 81 km(3) of active groundwater currently stored at the Cascade Range crest, with discharge variability a strong function of bedrock age. Deeply circulating groundwater also impacts volcanism, and Holocene High Cascades eruptions reflect explosive magma-water interactions that increase regional volcanic hazard potential. We propose that a Critical Zone state shift drives volcanic landscape evolution in wet climates and represents a framework for understanding interconnected solid earth dynamics and climate in these terrains.					; Finn, Carol/HKN-9277-2023	Karlstrom, Leif/0000-0002-2197-2349; Fasth, Becky/0000-0001-5006-6727; Klema, Nathaniel/0000-0003-2295-0309; Cashman, Katharine/0000-0001-9312-8377; Grant, Gordon/0000-0002-3012-5192													0027-8424	1091-6490				JAN 13	2025	122	3							e2415155122	10.1073/pnas.2415155122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415155122								39805016					WOS:001417150500003

We present an easy to use set-up for filming algal cells using Apocalathium aciculiferum and Borghiella dodgei as case studies; both dinoflagellates are model organisms of psychrophilic dinoflagellates. We filmed at low temperature (4.5 degrees C) using a digital camera directly connected to a microscope and used open-source software to track their movement. We encountered several technical issues that were solved by using specific software settings (scaling, grey scale of images, restrictive particle recognition), and thus we obtained unbiased speed estimates. Borghiella dodgei showed a faster (minimum = 80, maximum = 255, median = 141 mu m s(-1)) swimming speed than A. aciculiferum (minimum = 29, maximum = 134, median = 85 mu m s(-1)). We linked differences in swimming speed to the dinoflagellates' environmental niche, and suggested that B. dodgei is more adapted to turbulent spring conditions than A. aciculiferum, occurring under ice. The use of a generic digital camera and open-source software makes filming and tracking of plankton movement very affordable. We provided code and detailed instructions to disseminate this type of movement analysis of plankton.

The lake was being artificially mixed at the time by supplying compressed air to the bottom waters and the limnological events contributing to the development of the Ceratium population, and its collapse appear to be closely related to the artificial destratification process. Artificial destratification during 1976 precluded the development of blue-green algae. The process also led to an increase in the density of herbivorous zooplankters which controlled the development of smaller planktonic algae. Ceratium fluorished in Heart Lake because there was little competition for nutrients from other algae and because Ceratium cells are too large to be grazed by the zooplankton. The maximum size of the Ceratium population (53 mm3 l-1) is apparently the highest reported biomass, and its collapse may have been related to a depletion of inorganic N. There is apparently no previously published record of a Ceratium-induced fish-kill in a freshwater lake.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	6					553	561		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01231.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01231.x													WOS:A1980KT41800009
J	Maldonado, A; Villagrán, C				Maldonado, Antonio; Villagran, Carolina			Climate variability over the last 9900 cal yr BP from a swamp forest pollen record along the semiarid coast of Chile	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												We present a fossil pollen analysis from a swamp forest in the semiarid coast of Chile (32 degrees 05'S; 71 degrees 30'W), at the northern influence zone of southern westerly wind belt. A similar to 10,000 cal yr BP (calendar years before 1950) palynological sequence indicates a humid phase characterized by dense swamp forest taxa dated between similar to 9900 and 8700 cal yr BP. The presence of pollen-starved sediments with only scant evidence for semiarid vegetation indicates that extreme aridity ensued until similar to 5700 cal yr BP. The swamp forest recovered slowly afterwards, helped by a significant increase in moisture at similar to 4200 cal yr BP. A new swamp forest contraction suggests that another slightly less intense drought occurred between similar to 3000 and 2200 cal yr BP. The swamp forest expansion begins again at similar to 2200 cal yr BP, punctuated by a highly variable climate. Comparisons between the record presented here with other records across the region imply major variations in the extent of the southern westerlies during the Holocene. This variability could have been caused either by latitudinal displacements from the present mean position of southern westerlies wind belt or by changes in the intensity of the South Pacific Subtropical Anticyclone, both of which affect winter precipitation in the region.

J	Mackay, JR				Mackay, JR			A full-scale field experiment (1978-1995) on the growth of permafrost by means of lake drainage, western Arctic coast: A discussion of the method and some results	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												On 13 August 1978, a lake on the western Arctic coast was artificially drained, in a multidisciplinary experiment on the growth of permafrost on the unfrozen bottom of the drained lake. A bowl-shaped talik (unfrozen basin) with a maximum depth of about 32 m underlay the lake bottom prior to drainage. In the first winter after drainage, downward freezing started on the exposed lake bottom and upward freezing from permafrost beneath the talik. After drainage, the soft lake-bottom sediments hardened from water loss and freeze-thaw consolidation. Gradual thinning of the active layer at many sites was accompanied by ground uplift and the growth of aggradational ice. Downward and upward freezing has resulted in solute rejection, freezing-point depressions, pore-water expulsion from the freezing of the saturated lake-bottom sands, and convective heat transfer from groundwater flow in an open hydrologic system. The increasingly saline intrapermafrost groundwater, flowing at an increasingly negative temperature because of a freezing-point depression, has accelerated the rate of permafrost growth in the interpermafrost zone in the direction of flow. The experiment has demonstrated that the growth of permafrost at the drained lake site, and at other sites with groundwater flow, requires a three-dimensional conductive-convective heat transfer approach.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1997	34	1					17	33		10.1139/e17-002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e17-002													WOS:A1997XF19200002

We wished to determine if phytoplankton and bacteria differed in their elemental characteristics and to evaluate whether the functional role of bacteria in nutrient cycling (i.e., as sink or source) depended on bacterial elemental characteristics. Bacterial contributions to total suspended particulate material and to fluxes of nutrients in the dark were substantial and varied for different elements. This indicated that some techniques for assaying phytoplankton physiological condition are compromised by bacterial contributions. C/N ratios were generally less variable than C/P and N/P ratios. Both elemental ratios and biomass-normalized N and P flux indicated that phytoplankton growth in each lake was predominantly P-limited, although in L227 these data reflect the dominance of N-fixing cyanobacteria, and N was likely limiting early in the sampling season. In L227, phytoplankton N/P ratio and biomass-normalized N flux were negatively correlated, indicating that flux data were likely a reasonable measure of the N status of the phytoplankton. However, for L227 phytoplankton, P-flux per unit biomass was a hyperbolic function of N/P, suggesting that the dominant L227 cyanobacteria have a limited uptake and storage capacity and that P-flux per unit biomass may not be a good gauge of the P-limitation status of phytoplankton in this situation. Examination of N-flux data in the bacterial size fraction relative to the N/P ratio of the bacteria revealed a threshold N/P ratio (similar to 22.1 N/P, by atoms), below which, bacteria took up and sequestered added N, and above which, N was released. Thus, the functional role of bacteria in N cycling in these ecosystems depended on their N/P stoichiometry.					; Elser, James/A-7082-2008	Sterner, Robert/0000-0003-2292-6122; Elser, James/0000-0002-1460-2155													0095-3628					MAR-APR	1995	29	2					145	162		10.1007/BF00167161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00167161								24186720					WOS:A1995QH64200003

Eighteen restriction endonucleases were employed to analyze 126 brood stock fish. Two of these enzymes (Hind III and Bam HI) were used to examine the fish from the natural populations (Hare Island (Lake Superior) and North Knife Lake (Manitoba)) and the remaining brood stock samples from the Manitou (12 fish) and Seneca (13 fish) strains. The mitochondrial genome of the lake trout was 16800 .+-. 200 pairs in length. A single heteroplasmic individual was discovered in the Manitou strain. It contained two genomes, the less frequent of which was 20 base pairs shorter than the other. The 18 restriction enzymes resolved 13 mitochondrial clones which fell into three major groups. These clonal groups, which can be identified by their Bam HI restriction phenotypes, have a specific distribution: a western Great Lakes group, a central Great Lakes group, and an eastern Great Lakes group. Seven mitochondrial clones were unique to a particular stock. In addition there were dramatic shifts in the relative proportions of the six remaining mitochondrial clones among the brood stocks. These results indicate that mitochondrial DNA markers have great potential for the identifications and management of lake trout strains.

A field test on the effectiveness of milfoil weevil for controlling Eurasian watermilfoil in Wisconsin lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We tested the effectiveness of milfoil weevils (Euhrychiopsis lecontei) for reducing biomass of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum, EWM) under natural lake conditions in a 3-year field experiment. In each of four lakes, we randomly chose two EWM beds for stocking and two beds as controls. A total of ca. 40,000 weevils were added to the eight stocked beds. During June and August 2013-2015, we measured plant diversity, biomass of EWM and native plants, and weevil abundance in the 16 study beds. Background weevil densities varied widely among beds and were often greater than the densities stocked. Weevil stocking had no significant effect on EWM or native plant biomass. Nevertheless, weevil damage to EWM was common and its extent appeared strongly related to observed densities of the weevil. ANCOVA results indicated that weevil density was a significant predictor of EWM biomass in both June and August, but not on growth during summer. Overall, our study found that weevil density is an important factor for predicting EWM biomass, while weevil density is likely affected by a large number of environmental factors. This work highlights the importance of carefully considering lake conditions that may influence the efficacy of stocking for biological control.

The representative species was M. aeruginosa (Kutz.) Kutz., constituting 57%-86% of the Microcystis population throughout the study period, and the remainder were M. viridis (A. Braun) Lemmerm. and M. wesenbergii (Komarek) Komarek. The FDC of M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii increased in the daytime and fell in the nighttime in July and August, but this regular variation was not observed in September or October. The in situ specific growth rates of Microcystis species were estimated based on the assumption that the specific growth rate can be given as an absolute value of the derivative of FDC with respect to time. The calculated values were similar among species-0.15-0.38 . d(-1) for M. aeruginosa, 0.14-0.63 . d(-1) for M. viridis, and 0.18-0.61 . d(-1) for M. wesenbergii. The specific growth rates in July and August slightly exceeded those in September and October. The analysis of the in situ specific growth rate of Microcystis indicated that recruitment of the benthic population or morphological change, rather than massive growth, was at least partly responsible for the dominance of M. aeruginosa in the study pond.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				OCT	2009	45	5					1003	1009		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2009.00723.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2009.00723.x								27032344					WOS:000270901800002

However, most previous studies merely detected algal blooms according to the characteristics of the water body at the time of algal bloom occurrence, overlooking the influence of environmental factors on algae proliferation. This study proposes a novel algal bloom risk assessment framework that integrates explainable machine learning with multivariate environmental analysis. Specifically, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) effect values were used to separately explore the relationship between chlorophyll a (Chla) and six factors, namely the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), TN: TP ratio (RNP), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and precipitation, across riverine and lacustrine ecosystems. Results identified TP and temperature as dominant regulators, accounting for the first two in lakes and the second and third positions in rivers. The thermal effect varies between different ecosystems: Chla decreases after reaching a peak in lakes, while Chla increases linearly with temperature in rivers. In addition, DO played an important role in rivers. The Chla concentration was estimated using Random Forest and thresholds for bloom identification were adjusted (25 mu g/ L for lakes and 40 mu g/L for rivers), reflecting hydrodynamic and optical disparities. The risk framework was applied to the Qiantang River Basin (2020-2022), and results showed low annual risk (mean Algal Bloom Risk Index <0.5) but identified spring susceptibility related to nutrient resuspension and thermal stratification. By quantifying the impact of environmental factors on algal blooms, this study improves algal bloom risk assessment in rivers and lakes, which advances proactive bloom management in mixed river-lake basins under intensifying anthropogenic and climatic pressures.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				JUL	2025	87								103098	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103098		MAR 2025											WOS:001444287500001

The data were used to identify and calibrate a statistical regression model aimed at predicting when the bacterial concentration of the beach water was above or below the level considered safe for full body contact. A wide range of hydrological, meteorological, and water quality variables were evaluated as possible predictive variables. These included wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation ( insolation), various time frames of rainfall, air temperature, lake stage and wave height, and water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. The best-fit model combined real-time measurements of wind direction and speed ( onshore component of resultant wind vector), rainfall, insolation, lake stage, water temperature and turbidity to predict the geometric mean E. coli concentration in the swimming zone of the beach. The model, which contained both additive and multiplicative (interaction) terms, accounted for 71% of the observed variability in the log E. coli concentrations. A comparison between model predictions of when the beach should be closed and when the actual bacterial concentrations were above or below the 235 cfu 100 ml(-1) threshold value, indicated that the model accurately predicted openings versus closures 88% of the time.																			0167-6369					NOV	2004	98	1-3					175	190		10.1023/B:EMAS.0000038185.79137.b9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EMAS.0000038185.79137.b9								15473535					WOS:000223361000010

Analysis of free and metabolized microcystins in samples following a bird mortality event	HARMFUL ALGAE												In the summer of 2012, over 750 dead and dying birds were observed at the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Maryland, USA (Chesapeake Bay). Clinical signs suggested avian botulism, but an ongoing dense Microcystis bloom was present in an impoundment on the island. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of a water sample indicated 6000 ng mL(-1) of microcystins (MCs). LC-UV/MS analysis confirmed the presence of MC-LR and a high concentration of an unknown MC congener (m/z 1037.5). The unknown MC was purified and confirmed to be [D-Leu(1)]MC-LR using NMR spectroscopy, LC-HRMS and LC-MS2, which slowly converted to [D-Leu(1),G1u(OMe)(6)]MC-LR during storage in MeOH. Lyophilized algal material from the bloom was further characterized using LC-HRMS and LC-MS2 in combination with chemical derivatizations, and an additional 24 variants were detected, including MCs conjugated to Cys, GSH and gamma-GluCys and their corresponding sulfoxides. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) livers were tested to confirm MC exposure. Two broad-specificity MC ELISAs and LC-MS2 were used to measure free MCs, while 'total' MCs were estimated by both MMPB (3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid) and thiol de-conjugation techniques. Free microcystins in the livers (63-112 ng g(-1)) accounted for 33-41% of total microcystins detected by de-conjugation and MMPB techniques. Free [D-Leu(1)]MC-LR was quantitated in tissues at 25-67 ng g(-1) (LC-MS2). The levels of microcystin varied based on analytical method used, highlighting the need to develop a comprehensive analysis strategy to elucidate the etiology of bird mortality events when microcystin-producing HABs are present.

Tracking hydrological responses of a thermokarst lake in the Old Crow Flats (Yukon Territory, Canada) to recent climate variability using aerial photographs and paleolimnological methods	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Recent studies using remote sensing analysis of lake-rich thermokarst landscapes have documented evidence of declining lake surface area in response to recent warming. However, images alone cannot identify whether these declines are due to increasing frequency of lake drainage events associated with accelerated thermokarst activity or to increasing evaporation in response to longer ice-free season duration. Here, we explore the potential of combining aerial photograph time series with paleolimnological analyses to track changes in hydrological conditions of a thermokarst lake in the Old Crow Flats (OCF), Canada, and to identify their causes. Images show that the water level in lake OCF 48 declined markedly sometime between 1972 and 2001. In a sediment core from OCF 48, complacent stratigraphic profiles of several physical, geochemical, and biological parameters from similar to 18741967 indicate hydro-limnological conditions were relatively stable. From similar to 19671989, declines in organic matter content, organic carbon isotope values, and pigment concentrations are interpreted to reflect an increase in supply of minerogenic sediment, and subsequent decline in aquatic productivity, caused by increased thermo-erosion of shoreline soils. Lake expansion was likely caused by increased summer rainfall, as recorded by increased cellulose-inferred lake-water oxygen isotope compositions. Stratigraphic trends defining the lake expansion phase terminated at similar to 1989, which likely marks the year when the lake drained. Above-average precipitation during the previous year probably raised the lake level and promoted further thermo-erosion of the shoreline soils that caused the lake to drain. These are meteorological conditions that have led to other recent lake-drainage events in the OCF. Thus, the decline in lake level, evident in the aerial photograph from 2001, is unlikely to have been caused by evaporation, but rather is a remnant of a drainage event that took place more than a decade earlier. After drainage, the lake began to refill, and most paleolimnological parameters approach levels that are similar to those during the stable phase. These findings indicate that combined use of aerial images and paleolimnological methods offers much promise for identifying the hydrological consequences of recent climatic variations on thermokarst lakes.

The approach consists of four procedures: (1) identifying the target annual inflow (pear) of endorheic lake; (2) calculating available consumable water (ACW) in the upstream based on Q(tar): (3) setting ET deduction goals using water consumption balance approach; (4) estimating crop area to be deducted. This approach is implemented at Ebinur Lake of China under two restoration scenarios (lake area restored to 522 km(2) and 800 km(2)). The results indicate that to restore the Ebinur Lake to 522 km(2), the annual inflow should be increased to 602.6 x 10(6) m(3), and human water consumption should be reduced by 320.3 x 10(6) m(3). If the restoration goal of Ebinur Lake is set to 800 km(2), an annual inflow of 876.6 x 10(6) m(3) is required, and the human water consumption should be reduced by 594.2 x 10(6) m(3). The over-expansion of cropland and artificial forest is found to be the main reasons for the shrinkage of Ebinur Lake. Finally, the feasible solutions for ecosystem restoration of Lake Ebinur are provided for both scenarios. The methodology adopted in this research can be applied to the restoration of other inland lakes in arid regions. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhou, J; Qin, BQ; Han, XX				Zhou, Jian; Qin, Boqiang; Han, Xiaoxia			Effects of the magnitude and persistence of turbulence on phytoplankton in Lake Taihu during a summer cyanobacterial bloom	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Turbulence, a ubiquitous feature of geophysical fluids and highly variable both in space and time, is a major driver of change in both physicochemical characteristics and phytoplankton communities of the water column. The effects, however, of the magnitude and persistence of turbulence on phytoplankton community structure and dynamics of harmful algal blooms are still poorly understood in lakes. To explore the importance of the kinetic energy and duration of turbulence in phytoplankton, a 15-day mesocosm experiment was carried out and tested under four turbulence regimes namely calm water (control), low (energy dissipation rate, E > = 1.12 x 10(-6)), medium (E > = 2.95 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-3)) and high (E > = 1.48 x 10(-4) m(2) s(-3)) turbulence, which are comparable to the natural hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Taihu. Results showed that turbulences promoted the growth of phytoplankton and shifted the phytoplankton community structure from being cyanobacteria-dominated (Microcystis spp.) to diatom-dominated (Fragilaria spp.) community after a lag phase of 8-11 days. However, before the 6th day, the biomass of Microcystis spp. was dramatically promoted under turbulent conditions. These findings suggest that the dominance of diatom may be independent within a certain range of turbulent kinetic energy under constant turbulence conditions. This study suggests that short-term (< 6 days) turbulence, regardless of its kinetic energy, is beneficial for the cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) in eutrophic lakes.

General features of Mirogrex scales are described. There was a regular appearance of annuli, and the relative position of respective annuli was consistent among scales. The number of annuli were observed to increase systematically as growth proceeded. Modes of small fish in the length-frequency distribution of catch coincided with the modal lengths of corresponding age-groups based on scale readings. Annulus formation occurred in late March or during the month of April, when water temperatures increased after the winter minimum. Lengths at the time of annulus formation, calculated from scale measurements, agreed well with corresponding empirical lengths of younger age-groups whose ages had been determined by scale reading. Annuli found on scales of Mirogrex were shown to be valid year marks for estimating the age and growth of this species in Lake Kinneret. Mirogrex aged 1-4 years at the time of annulus formation ranged in size from 95-176mm. Their greatest gain in weight occurred between ages two and three.																			0005-4577					DEC	1986	38	4					108	125																WOS:A1986G021600002

Middle-late Quaternary palaeoclimate variability from lake and wetland deposits in the Nefud Desert, Northern Arabia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Records of former lake and wetland development in present day arid/hyper-arid environments provide an important source of information for palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental studies. In Arabia, such records are typically confined to eccentricity-modulated insolation maxima, and are often spatially and temporally discontinuous. Here we present records from a single locality in Northern Arabia of wetter interludes during both global interglacial and glacial conditions, providing a unique opportunity to examine the nature of these events in a common setting. At Jubbah, in the southern Nefud Desert, lake and wetland deposits reveal the repeated formation of a water body within a large endorheic basin over the past ca. 360 kyr. Lake/wetland formation occurred during MIS 11/9, 7, 5, 3 and the early Holocene, assisted by local topographic controls, and spring recharge. Palaeoenvironmental and palaeoecological data reveal the existence of a large still water body formed during either MIS 11 or 9 (ca. 363 ka), and basin wide alluviation followed by lake formation during MIS 7 (ca. 212 ka). During MIS 5e (ca. 130 ka) a large freshwater lake occupied the basin, while during MIS 5a (ca. 80 ka) the basin contained a shallow wetland and freshwater lake complex. Lake/wetland formation also occurred during early MIS 3 (ca. 60 ka), at the Terminal Pleistocene-Holocene transition (ca. 12.5 ka), and the early-middle Holocene (ca. 9-6.5 ka). Phases of lake and wetland development coincided with human occupation of the basin during the Middle Palaeolithic, Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic periods, highlighting the significance of the region for early demographic change.

The influence of rainfall events on the toxicity of urban wastewaters to freshwater mussels Elliptio complanata	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												The cumulative impacts of rainfall frequency and intensity towards the ecotoxicity of urban pollution is gaining more and more attention in these times of climate change. The purpose of this study was to examine the ecotoxicological impacts of combined sewers overflows and municipal effluent discharge sites during 3 periods (years) of varying intensity precipitations to freshwater mussels Elliptio complanata. Mussels were placed in benthic cages for 3 months during the summer at 2 overflow discharge and 8 km downstream sites including an upstream site for three consecutive years with low (164 mm), medium (182 mm) and high (248 mm) amounts of rain. The results revealed that the effects were mainly influenced by suspended matter loadings and to the dissolved components to a lesser extent. Impacts at the downstream and overflow sites were noticeable at the reproduction (vitellogenin), genotoxicity, neurotoxicity (dopamine and serotonin changes) levels in addition to xenobiotic biotransformation revealed by glutathione S-transferase activity and metallothioneins for organic and heavy metals respectively. The site downstream the effluent produced most of the effects compared to the overflow sites in the Saint-Lawrence River. However, the impacts of combined sewers overflows could become problematic in low dilution systems such as small river and lakes.

Organic substrates are therefore frequently added to mine lake sediments to stimulate sulfate reduction. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was added to sediment collected from three mine lakes, one (in Germany) with typically high concentrations of Fe and SO4 and another two (in Australia) with unusually low concentrations of Fe and SO4. After the DOC additions caused the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the overlying waters to fall below 50 mu mol L-1, the sediment porewater at all sites progressed through the expected anaerobic respiration sequence. The paucity of Fe and SO4 in the Australian lakes did not appear to constrain microbial iron and sulfate reduction. Indeed, the low Fe concentrations appeared to promote microbial sulfate reduction in the Australian sites. In the German site, there was little evidence of sulfide production in the porewater and no changes in porewater pH profiles. In contrast, the sediment porewater from the two Australian sites exhibited sulfide production and increased porewater pH. Bioremediation of acidic lakes must consider the need to treat iron-rich water before attempting pH amelioration.					; Koschorreck, Matthias/E-1251-2015; Oldham, Carolyn/F-8458-2013	Oldham, Carolyn/0000-0003-2968-6889; Koschorreck, Matthias/0000-0002-4393-3500; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2009	60	7			SI		660	668		10.1071/MF08080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF08080													WOS:000268372100007

Two quantitatively distinctive topset-to-forest rollover trajectories and clinothem-stacking patterns were recognized in the Oligocene Qikou Sag of the Bohai Bay Basin and are quantified in terms of trajectory angles (T-se), topset thickness (T-t), forest thickness (T-f), bottomset thickness (T-b), and clinothem-set relief (R-c). Rising topset-to-forest trajectories have positive T-se of 0.15 degrees-0.51 degrees (averaging 0.35 degrees). Ranges in T-t, T-f, T-b, and R-c of their associated progradational and aggradational clinothem sets are, respectively, 32.4-58.7 m (averaging 42.7 m), 76.9-176.2 m (averaging 148.3 m), 0 m, and 167.8-320.8 m (averaging 272.9 m). Falling topset-to-forest rollover trajectories, in contrast, have negative T-se of - 0.12 degrees to - 0.02 degrees (averaging - 0.06 degrees). Ranges in T-t, T-f, T-b, and R-c of their associated progradational and downstepping clinothem sets are, respectively, 0 m, 266.0-395.7 m (averaging 333.4 m), 441.1-542.5 m (averaging 464.1), and 874.9-922.6 m (averaging 892.5 m). These two topset-to-forest rollover trajectories and clinothem-stacking patterns are closely linked to two distinctive patterns of sediment- and sand-volume partitioning into deep-lake areas, which are quantified in terms of T-t, T-b, and differential sediment aggradation of topset segments and forest-to-bottomset compartments (A(s)/A(d)). Rising topset-to-forest rollover trajectories and associated progradational and aggradational clinothem sets are characterized by aggradational topsets (reported as T-t of 32.4-58.7 m), a lack of time-equivalent bottomsets, and A(s)/A(d) of 0.22-0.87 (averaging 0.33), and are fronted by mud-dominated depositional deposits, with sporadic occurrence of thinner and regionally localized forest sands. They are, therefore, inefficient at delivering terrestrial sediments or sands into deep-lake settings. Falling topset-to-forest rollover trajectories and associated progradational and downstepping clinothem sets, in contrast, are characterized by toplap, erosional terminations but aggradational bottomsets (reported as T-b of 266.0-473.4 m), and A(s)/A(d) of 0, and are fronted by sand-rich depositional deposits, with widespread occurrence of thicker and regionally extensive time-equivalent deep-lake bottomset sands. They are, thus, efficient at delivering terrestrial sediments or sands into deep-lake settings. Topset-to-forest rollover trajectories and associated clinothem-stacking patterns are thus reliable predictors of sediment- and sand-volume partitioning into deep-lake areas, assisting greatly in developing a more dynamic stratigraphy.

Modeling stream-bank erosion in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Deforestation, followed by soil erosion and subsequent deposition of alluvium in valleys, played a critical role in the formation of historical terraces in much of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains. Such terraces add a significant amount of sediment to the tributaries of the region as streams laterally erode the terrace banks. This study examined the contribution of total sediment yield derived solely from eroded stream banks in small watersheds (<20km(2)), using floodplain widths as proxies for long-term lateral erosion rates. The raw data were derived from watersheds with different land covers (Coweeta Creek and Skeenah Creek watersheds in the Upper Little Tennessee River basin). Bank-derived sediment yield estimates were modeled in a Geographic Information System, using linear regression to relate floodplain widths and erodible terrace bank heights. We found total stream length to be a good predictor of both lateral erosion rates and erodible bank heights. Land cover, basin/network morphometrics, and reach-scale stream conditions were not good predictors. Modeled lateral migration and sediment yield results compare favorably to empirical measurements from five independent watersheds in the region. Modeled estimates fall within +/- 50% or better of the observed values, at 16.33 to 25.02 t km(-2) yr(-1).																			0272-3646	1930-0557				OCT 1	2013	34	4-5			SI		354	372		10.1080/02723646.2013.846745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2013.846745													WOS:000326363700007

These phytoplankton populations occur in the metalimnia of lakes where light levels are moderate to low, and where nutrient levels and zooplankton grazing pressure are different than in the epilimnion. To test the importance of nutrients and grazing pressure for algal growth in different lake strata, microcosm experiments and monitoring were conducted in two oligotrophic lakes in the Rocky Mountains of North America that contain DCL. In situ microcosm experiments with natural phytoplankton communities from three depth strata were conducted with macronutrient additions and with and without the natural zooplankton grazing communities. Alkaline phosphatase assays and the in situ microcosm experiments indicated less nutrient limitation in the metalimnia than in the epilimnia of both lakes. Zooplankton grazing in the experiments decreased algal population growth rates by as much as 6% day(-1), with impacts shifting to progressively deeper strata over the summer. Zooplankton grazing losses, however, were partially offset by nutrient recycling that increased algal growth rates. Depth-differential nutrient deficiency and zooplankton grazing and recycling interacted to maintain the DCL in these lakes.

PAM application in coastal cities like Chicago is of interest; however severe winters compromise the durability of PAMs given their susceptibility to freeze-thaw. This work aimed to evaluate the to-date experience with PAMs in Chicago, exploring benefits and limitations to be considered for future projects in the Southern Lake Michigan region. Full-depth PAM cores were obtained from seven sections, constructed in different years. Tests were conducted to assess the evolution of surface texture, internal structure, and multi-scale material properties. Regarding surface texture, consistent change over time was observed, such as loss of the "channel" structure, and increase in mean profile parameters because of raveling. Also, binder content varies with time within different layer depths. An aging gradient in terms of stiffness from top to bottom within the layer does not necessarily occur. However, binder ductility shows drastic and consistent reduction throughout the layer as aging increases. Analysis of internal structure using a CT scan revealed that there is also a lack of homogeneity in the air void and particle size distributions. Finally, this study suggests that full-depth PAM viscoelastic behavior is sensitive to saturation level, and this is a relevant subject to be considered, since partial saturation may be a condition often observed in the field.

Specific conductance @ 25.degree. C can be used in the mixing model because it varies from 95 .mu.S .cntdot. cm-1 in Lake Super waters to 267 .mu.S .cntdot. cm-1 in Lake Michigan waters. Results shows that silica concentrations in the outflow of Lake Michigan in 1954 were comparable to the Lake Superior concentrations (ca. 2.0 mg .cntdot. L-1) but were reduced to < 0.4 mg .cntdot. L-1 in summer cruises beginning in 1968. These results provide strong evidence that silica concentrations in the outflowing waters of Lake Michigan decreased at least 2.0 mg .cntdot. L-1 from 195 to 1971. Confidence can be given to this postulated decrease in concentration because the accuracy of data used in these analyses was verified by comparisons with the relatively invariate silica concentration in Lake Superior.																			0380-1330						1985	11	4					492	500		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71792-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71792-3													WOS:A1985AXC3300007

The time-scale has been constructed from conventional and accelerator radiocarbon ages back to approximately 45 Ka BP and beyond this by comprehensive pollen studies which identify forest and steppe cycles that have been related to marine oxygen isotopic stages 4 and 5. Spectral analyses of the intensity and directional records using both Fourier and maximum entropy methods reveal strong low-frequency components which fall in the range of the Milankovitch obliquity and precession periodicities (40-20 Ka). It is concluded that although part of this signal may have fed indirectly into the natural remanence via the influence of climatic change on sediment facies, part has been impressed directly by perturbation of the geomagnetic dynamo process at the core-boundary by variations in the Earth's obliquity and precession. These long periods envelop a well-defined pattern, registered also by the independent 'Mackereth' core stack back to 50 Ka BP, of irregular secular oscillations of the geodynamo with periods of a few thousands of years.

J	Hong, JL; Liu, YM				Hong Jieli; Liu Yimin			Contrasts of atmospheric circulation and associated tropical convection between Huaihe River valley and Yangtze River valley mei-yu flooding	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The significant differences of atmospheric circulation between flooding in the Huaihe and Yangtze River valleys during early mei-yu (i.e., the East Asian rainy season in June) and the related tropical convection were investigated. During the both flooding cases, although the geopotential height anomalies always exhibit equivalent barotropic structures in middle to high latitudes at middle and upper troposphere, the phase of the Rossby wave train is different over Eurasian continent. During flooding in the Huaihe River valley, only one single blocking anticyclone is located over Baikal Lake. In contrast, during flooding in the Yangtze River valley, there are two blocking anticyclones. One is over the Ural Mountains and the other is over Northeast Asia. In the lower troposphere a positive geopotential height anomaly is located at the western ridge of subtropical anticyclone over Western Pacific (SAWP) in both flooding cases, but the location of the height anomaly is much farther north and west during the Huaihe River mei-yu flooding. Furthermore, abnormal rainfall in the Huaihe River valley and the regions north of it in China is closely linked with the latent heating anomaly over the Arabian Sea and Indian peninsula. However, the rainfall in the Yangtze River valley and the regions to its south in China is strongly related to the convection over the western tropical Pacific. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the enhanced latent heating over the Arabian Sea and Indian peninsula causes water vapor convergence in the region south of Tibetan Plateau and in the Huaihe River valley extending to Japan Sea with enhanced precipitation; and vapor divergence over the Yangtze River valley and the regions to its south with deficient precipitation. While the weakened convection in the tropical West Pacific results in moisture converging over the Yangtze River and the region to its south, along with abundant rainfall.

Growth patterns of Mytilopsis leucophaeata, an invasive biofouling bivalve in Europe	BIOFOULING												For the first time, growth of Mytilopsis leucophaeata, an important European fouling species, was investigated. By means of growth cages, individual shell growth of three cohorts, with, respectively, initial shell lengths of <= 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm, was monitored in the harbour of Antwerp, Belgium, during 2003-2004. M. leucophaeata followed an oscillatory growth pattern with a single summer growing period per year (May to August). Growth decreased during wintertime, but never ceased completely. M. leucophaeata has an average growth rate of < 3-6 mm year(-1). Temperature was found to be the main environmental factor affecting growth. The von Bertalanffy growth function was used to model growth of individuals <= 5 mm, resulting in L-infinity = 16.7 mm and K = 0.56. Based on a combination of growth of all three cohorts, the hypothetical growth of an average individual mussel could be modelled over a 5- year period, resulting in a maximum length 419 mm with a growth rate of 0.41.

J	EILER, JH; NELSON, BD; BRADSHAW, RF				EILER, JH; NELSON, BD; BRADSHAW, RF			RIVERINE SPAWNING BY SOCKEYE-SALMON IN THE TAKU RIVER, ALASKA AND BRITISH-COLUMBIA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Radio telemetry was used to determine the distribution of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka returning to spawn in the glacial Taku River in 1984 and 1986, and to locate and characterize spawning areas used by this species. During the study, 253 sockeye salmon were tracked as they moved upriver; 204 of these were followed to spawning areas. Only 37% of the 204 fish traveled to areas associated with lakes, the remaining 63% returned to ''riverine'' areas-river areas without lakes (42% to the Taku River main stem, 17% to the Nakina River, and 4% to other rivers). Sockeye salmon spawning in riverine areas used a variety of habitat types, including main-river channels, side channels, tributary streams, and upland sloughs. Most (55%) of the radio-tagged fish that returned to the Taku River main stem were tracked to side-channel spawning areas. Half of the 471 adult sockeye salmon sampled in main-stem spawning areas had migrated to sea as juveniles before their first winter. This study showed that many sockeye salmon returning to the Taku River do not depend on lakes, and that riverine sockeye salmon make up a major portion of the run in some river systems.																			0002-8487					NOV	1992	121	6					701	708		10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0701:RSBSSI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0701:RSBSSI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992KR62200001

This study presents the results of a preliminary microclimate field survey in two Avondale, Arizona, neighborhoods developed with artificial wastewater-treatment wetlands and one adjacent desert neighborhood. The preliminary field study reported here measured morning, near-noon, and afternoon air temperatures and, together with other observed variables, calculated mean radiant temperatures (critical to human comfort) at 28 locations across three neighborhoods on a sample day in September of 2018. The aim was to determine cooling effects of blue/green environments and identify benefits for residents. Overall results for September indicate 1-3 degrees C cooling, which is understandable for this time of year at summer's end. Mean radiant temperature results are substantially different at lake sites versus dry neighborhood sites (by some 5-20 degrees C), likely due to the presence of fewer lateral radiant fluxes and cooler exposures at lake sites compared with dry neighborhoods. Cooling benefits likely provide year-round outdoor comfort compared to desert-landscaped communities. The authors reinforce the conclusion that recycled water and treatment systems can reduce local heat island conditions and aid in combating extreme heat in the desert southwest. This study also shows that constructed wastewater-treatment wetlands in desert cities support sustainable residential developments.																				2071-1050				JUL	2024	16	13							5456	10.3390/su16135456	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16135456													WOS:001267999900001
J	Chen, YJ; Parmenter, S; May, B				Chen, Yongjiu; Parmenter, Steve; May, Bernie			Genetic characterization and management of the endangered Mohave tui chub	CONSERVATION GENETICS												The Mohave tui chub (Siphateles bicolor mohavensis) is the only fish native to the Mojave River, California. The fish were displaced by introduced arroyo chubs (Gila orcutti) throughout most of their range, starting in the 1930s. Two potentially relictual populations and two transplanted populations were genetically characterized using 12 microsatellite DNA loci, along with contemporary cyprinid populations in the Mojave River. We found only un-hybridized Mohave tui chubs in the refuge populations, and only un-hybridized arroyo chubs in the Mojave River. The two largest Mohave tui chub populations (Lake Tuendae and China Lake) exhibit similar, comparatively high genetic variation. Another large population (Camp Cady) with low genetic diversity shows the effect of a bottleneck of ten individuals during the historic founding event. The fourth population (MC Spring) has the fewest alleles, lowest heterozygosity, and is the most divergent, suggesting that genetic drift from a persistently low effective population size has reduced genetic diversity since its apparent isolation in 1934. We recommend instituting artificial gene flow to rebuild genetic variation in Camp Cady from both Lake Tuendae and China Lake, and the establishment of new populations with founders from both Lake Tuendae and China Lake. Additionally, we comment on the infeasibility of restoring populations of Mohave tui chub in their historic habitats.																			1566-0621	1572-9737				FEB	2013	14	1					11	20		10.1007/s10592-012-0410-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0410-6													WOS:000314065200002
J	Gerald, RS; David, RM; Peterson, NP; Crowley, B				Smith, Gerald R.; Montgomery, David R.; Peterson, N. Phil; Crowley, Bruce			Spawning sockeye salmon fossils in pleistocene lake beds of Skokomish valley, Washington	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												An assemblage of fossil sockeye salmon was discovered in Pleistocene take sediments along the South Fork Skokomish River, Olympic Peninsula, Washington. The fossils were abundant near the head of a former glacial lake at 115 in elevation. Large adult salmon are concentrated in a sequence of death assemblages that include individuals with enlarged breeding teeth and worn caudal fins indicating migration, nest digging, and spawning prior to death. The specimens were 4 yr old and 45-70 cm in total length, similar in size to modern sockeye salmon, not landlocked kokanee. The fossils possess most of the characteristics of sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, but with several minor traits suggestive of pink salmon, O. gorbuscha. This suggests the degree of divergence of these species at about I million yr ago, when geological evidence indicates the salmon were deposited at the head of a proglacial lake impounded by the Salmon Springs advance of the Puget lobe ice sheet. Surficial geology and topography record a complicated history of glacial damming and river diversion that implies incision of the modem gorge of the South Fork Skokomish River after deposition of the fossil-bearing sediments.

Effects of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on phytoplankton community structure under eutrophic conditions	AQUATIC INVASIONS												We conducted two mesocosm experiments to determine how invasive zebra mussels affected phytoplankton community and size structure in the summers of 2014 and 2017. Water containing natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities was collected from the eutrophic Lake Mikolajskie (Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland) and used to start each experiment. We analyzed how the introduction of zebra mussels impacted chlorophyll and the biomass of individual algae taxa, with particular interest on cyanobacteria. The starting phytoplankton communities differed in the two study years, whereby cyanobacteria dominated in 2014 and dinoflagellates and diatoms dominated in 2017. The biomass of crustacean zooplankton (cladocerans and copepods) was not affected by zebra mussels; therefore, we attributed differences in phytoplankton between treatments to the presence of zebra mussels. Zebra mussels had contrasting effects on cyanobacteria in the 2014 and 2017 experiments. In 2014, zebra mussels decreased cyanobacteria, while in 2017 they had a positive effect on cyanobacteria chlorophyll. The contrasting effects of zebra mussels on cyanobacteria could be related to differences in starting nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton communities between the two experiments. Filamentous green macroalgae dominated at the end of the both experiments in the zebra mussel treatments while they were not very abundant in the controls. Therefore, zebra mussels can have indirect negative effects on higher trophic levels even when they decrease cyanobacteria because they shift the autotrophic structure in favor of attached green macroalgae, which are a poor resource for zooplankton.					; Sakharova, Ekaterina/O-9430-2015	Irina, Feniova/0000-0002-8623-3491; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2020	15	3					435	454		10.3391/ai.2020.15.3.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2020.15.3.05													WOS:000601377700005

Study focus: This paper mainly focuses on quantifying changes in water storage of Bosten Lake using multi-mission satellite data. From Landsat images, we firstly extracted the lake area changes between 2003 and 2022 with the help of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI); Secondly, we used ICESat-1, CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2 altimetry data to draw the information of the water surface changes of the lake; Finally, the factors influencing the changes of the water volume of Bosten Lake were analyzed using meteorological and human activity data. New hydrological insights for the region: The findings indicate that the area of Bosten Lake has reduced from 1037.9 km2 to 1015.77 km2, the water level has fallen by 0.58 m, and the volume of water has lost by 1.07 km3 between 2003 and 2022. During this period, the temperature and precipitation changes did not significantly correlate with the lake changes. In fact, lake change has obvious relationship with ecological water transfer and agricultural activities in the area. This paper is meaning in strengthening the understanding of the variation of freshwater lakes in arid areas under the background of global warming and its role in the regional water system. It also correctly assessed the impact of climate change and human activities on lakes as well as provide technical support for the sustainable development of ecological environment.					; Zhang, Fei/AAD-6047-2019; Kumar, Pankaj/B-2854-2016; Liu, Changjiang/GVU-0201-2022; Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017; Tan, Mou/N-4678-2017	Liu, Changjiang/0000-0001-5854-4674; Zhang, Fei/0000-0002-1194-8513; Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336; Kumar, Pankaj/0000-0001-7099-7297; 														2214-5818				OCT	2023	49								101496	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101496		AUG 2023											WOS:001142897400001

It is the most visited tourist destination in Lombok that visited by domestic and international tourists. Despite its beauty, the Mount Rinjani region is in a natural hazard area both hydrometeorological and geological disasters, so that it becomes a disaster-prone area. Considering the vital role of tourism actors in the continuity of safe tourism activities, the research about awareness of disaster-prone area is needed. The awareness is formed through perception, alertness attitudes, and preparedness behavior. This research aims to identify perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of tourism actors towards hazards and disasters. The method that we used in this research is an interview, field observation, and literature study. Perceptions of tourism actors towards hazards are generally classified in the moderate category, while perceptions of disasters are generally classified as good. The attitude of tourism actors towards hazards is generally classified in the moderate category, while the attitude towards disasters is classified in good categories for agencies and moderate for tourism actors. The behavior of tourism actors towards hazards is generally classified in the moderate category, and behavior towards disasters also is generally classified in the moderate category.

Azores volcanic lakes: factors affecting water quality	WATER QUALITY: CURRENT TRENDS AND EXPECTED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS	IAHS Publication				25th General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics	JUN 28-JUL 07, 2011	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Int Commiss Water Resources Systems, Int Commiss Surface Water, Int Commiss Water Qual, Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, UNESCO-IHP				Azorean lakes represent strategic sources of freshwater and some supply water for human consumption. Several samples were collected from 13 volcanic lakes on four different islands. The lakes are cold, pH values ranged between 4.2 and 9.9 and demonstrated low levels of mineralization, except for Furnas do Enxofre, due to the input of volcanic gases that are responsible for the highest CO(2) and acidification of the lake. The lake waters were generally fresh and of Na-Cl and Na-HCO(3) types. The highest decline in lake water quality is related to anthropogenic pressure. Although the sao Miguel lakes demonstrate a volcanic signature, the effect of the volcano is not a significant contributor to water quality decline, except in the case of Furnas, for which ion charge increased due to the thermal water input and volatile degasification. However, for Furna do Enxofre, the lake is highly contaminated by volcanic fluids. Global warming will destroy the normal balance of water supply. During winter, the greater frequency of precipitation events will increase the input of fertilizers and sediments, causing an increase in water quality degradation. Temperature increases are expected to combine with water shortages due to increased evaporation to decrease lake water volume. Eutrophication is expected to worsen. Consequently, it is hypothesized that climate change will generally lead to an increased water quality degradation of these strategic water reservoirs.

Diet, trophic position of upper St. Lawrence River round goby giants reveals greater dependence on dreissenids with increasing body size	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) from the upper St. Lawrence River (USLR) have an abundance of some of the largest individuals recorded from the Great Lakes (>230-mm total-length). We found a distinct separation in diet and isotopic signatures (815N and 813C) between round goby classified as small (<130-mm; n = 63) and large (>130-mm total-length; n = 75) from USLR coastal bays. At small sizes, round gobies had variable diets indicative of generalist and opportunistic feeding on native and nonindigenous benthic prey. Between 100 and 130-mm total-length, signatures of assimilated carbon (813C) indicated a directed shift towards a dreissenid-centric diet and once larger than 130-mm totallength, round gobies appeared to feed proportionally more on dreissenid mussels. We also found that large round gobies fed proportionally more on Hydrobiidae than small round gobies. A weak negative relationship between 815N (indicative of trophic position) and round gobies total length resulted where smaller round gobies had slightly higher 815N values than larger conspecifics. Round gobies larger than 180-mm total-length were common in nearshore habitats (<2-m) during the spring, and dreissenid mussels and Hydrobiidae were the most frequently encountered prey. Our results demonstrate elevated reliance on dreissenids as round goby increased body size, but the diversity of prey suggest more complex trophodynamic pathways associated with coastal bay habitats.

Geoffrey			Wind-driven nearshore sediment resuspension in a deep lake during winter	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Ongoing public concern over declining water quality at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada (USA) led to an investigation of wind-driven nearshore sediment resuspension that combined field measurements and modeling. Field data included: wind speed and direction, vertical profiles of water temperature and currents, nearbed velocity, lakebed sediment characteristics, and suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution. Bottom shear stress was computed from ADV-measured nearbed velocity data, adapting a turbulent kinetic energy method to lakes, and partitioned according to its contributions attributed to wind-waves, mean currents, and random motions. When the total shear stress exceeded the critical shear stress, the contribution to overall shear stress was about 80% from wind-waves and 10% each from mean currents and random motions. Therefore, wind-waves were the dominant mechanism resulting in sediment resuspension as corroborated by simultaneous increases in shear stress and total measured sediment concentration. The wind-wave model STWAVE was successfully modified to simulate wind-wave-induced sediment resuspension for viscous-dominated flow typical in lakes. Previous lake applications of STWAVE have been limited to special instances of fully turbulent flow. To address the validity of expressions for sediment resuspension in lakes, sediment entrainment rates were found to be well represented by a modified 1991 Garcia and Parker formula. Last, in situ measurements of suspended sediment concentration and particle size distribution revealed that the predominance of fine particles (by particle count) that most negatively impact clarity was unchanged by wind-related sediment resuspension. Therefore, we cannot assume that wind-driven sediment resuspension contributes to Lake Tahoe's declining nearshore clarity.

A wide range of methods has been used by European member states to set river nutrient thresholds in the past, and these vary greatly among countries, even for similar river types. In some countries, thresholds have been set using expert judgement or the statistical distribution of nutrient concentrations. Application of such thresholds creates problems for planning strategies to achieve good ecological status and for managing transboundary river basins. An alternative approach is to examine the statistical relationship between nutrient concentration and one, or more, biological variables. Such relationships can then be used to inform decisions by water managers. We use such 'ecology-based' approaches (univariate regression and mismatch analyses) to derive nutrient thresholds for several river types in Central Europe. Our analysis focused on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total nitrogen (TN), two variables which were responsible for significant variation (40-55%) in river benthic floras. In this study, for the first time, river nutrient thresholds are estimated using both macrophytes and phytobenthos (EQRs) separately and in combination, calculated as the minimum and the average of the EQRs of the two subelements. The resulting thresholds supporting good ecological status range from 21 to 42 mu g/L SRP and 0.9-3.5 mg/L TN for the low alkalinity lowland river type, and 32-90 mu g/L SRP and 1.0-2.5 mg/L TN for the low alkalinity mid-altitude river type. These targets are compared to the values set by member states. We demonstrate that some national nutrient thresholds fall within the range of predicted values if uncertainty is taken into consideration; however, several threshold values considerably exceed this range. Adopting ecology-based nutrient targets should improve sustainable river management where nutrients are the major pressure preventing the achievement of good ecological status.					; Varbiro, Gabor/AAH-5587-2021; Varbiro, Gabor/G-9416-2011; Birk, Sebastian/B-3125-2013	Birk, Sebastian/0000-0002-2597-8692; Varbiro, Gabor/0000-0001-5907-3472; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2021	121								107017	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107017													WOS:000604882200012

By repeated sampling and analysis of dispersion patterns of six frequently occurring parasites no consistent evidence was found for mortality induced by a single parasite species. Linear log-variance to log-mean abundance ratios with slopes of c. 2 indicated negative binomial distributions for five of the six parasites. The numbers of these six parasites were combined as multiples Of S.D. of each parasite species over all samples to form an 'individual parasitation index' (I-PI), which showed that only in one locality a slight decrease in parasite burden occurred between September and April. In two of the lake populations, however, there was a distinct decline in the degree of dispersion in spring samples. This indicates that a combination of different species might cause parasite-induced host mortality, undetectable by patterns obtained from single species. There were differences in parasite diversity and intensity of infection among river compared to lake populations suggesting a role for parasites as selective agents in the ecological divergence of three-spined sticklebacks.

In order to establish a glacial chronology, we applied surface exposure dating, using in-situ produced cosmogenic Be-10, for 11 boulders from moraines in the Encierro Valley (29'S), northern Chile. We discuss sample-specific effects (topographic shielding, sample geometry rock surface erosion, inheritance and post-depositional geomorphological instability) and systematic uncertainties (production rate of Be-10, latitude and altitude scaling). Minor glacial advances probably occurred around 11.6 +/- 1.2 ka BP, whereas major advances are recorded at 14.0 +/- 1.4 ka BP and eventually at 24.1 +/- 2.4 ka BP. This may indicate synchrony of some Late Pleistocene glacial advances south and north of the so-called Arid Diagonal (similar to 25 degrees S). Increased precipitation plays a dominant role for the observed Late Pleistocene glacial advances. In the absence of further glacial chronologies south and north of the research area, it remains difficult to disentangle the influence of the complex and in space and time variable westerlies and the tropical summer precipitation regime.

Hence, lake-level variability is both a product of and a record of synoptic-scale climate variability. Here, a daily synoptic classification for 1956-1999 is used to evaluate historical Lake Michigan-Huron water levels in the context of changes in the frequency and intensity of synoptic-scale phenomena. The results demonstrate that both within-type evolution and shifts in the relative frequency of synoptic types contributed to precipitation and evaporation anomalies through the historical period with the former reflecting the importance of the Great Lakes in determining the regional climate. Shifts in the frequency and intensity of synoptic winter types are also demonstrated to be contributing anomalous precipitation and evaporation coincident with phases of lake level associated with the 30-year quasi-periodicity.

Water and surface sediments from several points of the Lake were collected during summer. Microbial analysis was performed for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus (ENT), Pseudomonas species and heterotrophic plate counts. PCR amplification was performed for the confirmation of E. coli, ENT, Pseudomonas spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from samples. The results reveal low concentration of bacteria in water column of the lake, the bacterial quantification results observed in this study for the water column were below the recommended limits, according to WHO and the European Directive 2006/7/CE, for bathing water. However, high concentration of bacteria was observed in the sediment samples; the values of 2.65 Au 10(3), 6.35 Au 10(3), 3.27 Au 10(3) and 3.60 Au 10(8) CFU g(-1) of dry sediment for E. coli, ENT, Pseudomonas spp. and heterotrophic plate counts, respectively. The results of this study indicate that sediments of the Lake Ma Vall,e can constitute a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms which can persist in the lake. Possible resuspension of faecal indicator bacteria and pathogens would affect water quality and may increase health risks to the population during recreational activities. Our results indicate that the microbial sediment analysis provides complementary and important information for assessing sanitary quality of surface water under tropical conditions.

Monitoring these occurrences is essential for water resource managers worldwide. Satellite remote sensing techniques can detect and quantify blooms in large inland and estuarine water bodies but monitoring blooms in small water bodies (< 10 km(2)), including narrow river/canal systems, remains challenging. This is due to the coarse spatial resolution (>300 m) or low re-visit frequency (>10 days) of most operational satellite sensors. The ephemeral nature of cyanobacterial blooms and their tendency to form dense surface mats (or "scums") that aggregate nearshore further highlight the need for sensors with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, a deep learning model based on convolutional neural network U-net was developed to detect cyanobacterial blooms (i.e., scums) in the highly modified and managed Caloosahatchee River (i.e., C-43 canal) and Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) (Florida, USA) using Dove imagery (3-m resolution) obtained near-daily from the PlanetScope satellite constellation. The approach consisted of three steps: 1) training and validating the U-net model with "ground truth" images; 2) classifying bloom pixels; and 3) quantifying bloom area using linear unmixing. Validation results indicate an overall F1 score of 89.6% when assessing bloom area. Application of the model revealed the westward expansion of a cyanobacteria bloom from C-43 to CRE in summer 2018, indicating the physical transport of the bloom originating upstream in Lake Okeechobee to the estuary. This approach was tested on other inland water bodies, indicating potential for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms on a global scale.					hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012; Xie, Yuyuan/CAI-2341-2022	Armstrong, Cassondra/0000-0001-6519-7164; Cannizzaro, Jennifer/0000-0002-9536-6333; Qi, Lin/0000-0003-3433-3252; 													0196-2892	1558-0644					2024	62								4202513	10.1109/TGRS.2024.3354211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2024.3354211													WOS:001164472500019

Chironomid δ18O as a proxy for past lake water δ18O: a Lateglacial record from Rotsee (Switzerland)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We explored whether the stable oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of fossil chironomid remains can be used to reconstruct past variations in lake water delta O-18 from Lateglacial and early Holocene sediments from Rotsee (Switzerland). A sediment core from the former littoral zone of the lake was examined since it contained both high concentrations of chironomid remains and abundant authigenic carbonates and therefore allowed a direct comparison of chironomid delta O-18 with values measured on bulk carbonates. Since carbonate particles adhering to chironomid remains potentially affect O-18 measurements we tested two methods to chemically remove residual carbonates. Trials with isotopically heavy and light acid solutions indicated that treatment with hydrochloric acid promoted oxygen exchange between chironomid remains and the water used during pretreatment. In contrast, a buffered 2 M ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution did not seem to affect chironomid delta O-18 to a significant extent. Fossil chironomid delta O-18 was analyzed for the Rotsee record both using standard palaeoecological methods and after pretreatment with NH4Cl. Samples prepared using standard techniques showed a poor correlation with delta O-18 of bulk carbonate (r(2) = 0.14) suggesting that carbonate contamination of the chironomid samples obscured the chironomid delta O-18 signature. Samples pretreated with NH4Cl correlated well with bulk carbonate delta O-18 (r(2) = 0.67) and successfully tracked the well-known Lateglacial changes in delta O-18. Chironomid delta O-18 indicated depleted lake water delta O-18 during the Oldest Dryas period, the Aegelsee and Gerzensee Oscillations, and the Younger Dryas, whereas enriched delta O-18 values were associated with sediments deposited during the Lateglacial interstadial and the early Holocene. Differences in the amplitude of variations in bulk carbonate and chironomid delta O-18 are attributed to differential temperature effects on oxygen isotope fractionation during the formation of carbonates and chironomid head capsules or seasonal changes of lake water delta O-18, potentially affecting delta O-18 of these two substances to a different extent. Our results indicate that chironomid delta O-18 can successfully reconstruct centennial to millennial-scale changes in lake water delta O-18 and that the method can be applied to carbonate-rich records provided that care is taken to eliminate carbonate contamination from the samples.

S	Green, J		Dumont, HJ		Green, Jim			The Kyoga Catchment	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											Lake Kyoga is a complex, shallow lake, which breaks into satellite lakes in the east. The eastern end receives inflows from Mount Elgon and the northern province of Karamoja. The main inflow to the western part of the lake comes from Lake Victoria. The outflow falls over 400 m before joining the outflow from Lake Albert. The vegetation is complex, with a fringe of papyrus, which also occurs as floating islands, and extensive areas of water lilies (Nymphaea). Since 1988 The Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia) has invaded the lake and influenced the distribution of some of the submerged plants. The water chemistry and phytoplankton vary along a gradient from east to west, with high conductivity and domination by Cyanobacteria in the east, and lower conductivity and domination by Melosira in the west. The zooplankton is dominated by cyclopoid copepods, although two species of diaptomids are also present. Cladocera occur in much smaller numbers, with Moina micrura the most frequent. Snail hosts of Schistosoma are present in the lake, and transmit disease to man and cattle. The precise number of fish species in Lake Kyoga is not known, but some of the satellite lakes have at least 60 species of haplochromines, as well as members of other families. The satellites are important because some have not yet been invaded by the Nile Perch, so that they can serve as conservation areas for endemic species.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						205	214				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800011

In contrast, emerged land was likely a more challenging environment during the Archaean, and only sparse evidence of life in non-marine environments has so far been identified. Here we document the abundance of isotopically light carbon (with delta C-13 values from -46.6 to -31.3 parts per thousand), diagnostic of a biogeochemical methane cycle or acetogenesis, in shale and sandstone deposited in similar to 3 billion-years-old acidic volcanic lakes on the Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. A distinctive Al-rich mineral assemblage with abundant pyrophyllite in lacustrine sedimentary rocks bears similarity to modern volcanic rocks affected by circulation of hot acidic fluids. This is compounded with an enrichment of Ni, Mo, W, As and Cu in whole-rockanalyses of sedimentary rocks, which is also observed in geothermal areas of modern volcanic environments. Analysis of early diagenetic pyrite in these sedimentary rocks indicates high nutrient level in the lake, which might reflect hydrothermal input with leaching of volcanic material. Despite the restricted and ephemeral nature of volcanic lakes, a highly productive and complex ecosystem established itself in this environment. Volcanic lakes during the Mesoarchaean thus served as an ecological niche for the development and diversification of microbial life on emerged continental landmasses. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Here we compare an 80-year-long annually resolved oxygen isotope record from Nar Golu, Turkey, a varved lake sequence, with instrumental records of temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity and calculated values of evaporation, all of which are known to be possible controls on lake oxygen isotope systems. Significant relationships are found between the isotope record and summer temperatures and evaporation suggesting these are dominant controls on the isotope hydrology of this non-outlet lake. Modelling the stable isotope hydrology of the lake system allows these relationships to be tested independently. We show that the isotope record follows the same trends in the temperature and evaporation records but that, even when combined, these two climatic factors cannot fully explain the magnitude of change observed in the isotope record. The models show the lake system is much less sensitive to changes in evaporation and temperature than the climate calibration suggests. Additional factors, including changes in the amount of precipitation, are required to amplify the isotope change. It is concluded that proxy-climate calibrations may incorrectly estimate the amplitude of past changes in individual climate parameters, unless validated independently.					; Türkeş, Murat/JUF-2348-2023; Jones, Matthew/JXM-5303-2024	Jones, Matthew/0000-0001-8116-5568; Moyeed, Rana/0000-0003-3705-8911; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2005	34	3					391	411		10.1007/s10933-005-6743-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-6743-0													WOS:000231064100008
J	Subrahmanya, KR				Subrahmanya, KR			Active intraplate deformation in south India	TECTONOPHYSICS												Two characteristics of the Indian plate are the intraplate deformation of the oceanic crust to the south of Bay of Bengal and the ongoing uplift of the continental crust in the southern Indian peninsula. An irregular line connecting Mulki on the West Coast and Pulicat Lake on the East Coast (close to 13 degrees N) constitutes a major drainage divide. Several large rivers of south India diverge from this line. This nearly east-west-trending ridge is characterised by gravity high, relatively thinner crust and microseismicity. The shoreline at either ends is convex towards sea. The coastal region particularly in the west is highly dissected. The coastal zone consists of series of beach ridges and swales indicating uplift of land. A close scrutiny of the river channels indicates that the rivers south of the major water divide have successively shifted southward leaving behind paleochannels on the Quaternary terrain. There is similar migration of streams to the north shifting northward. Even in areas where the gradient is low, the rivers have elevated terraces, resulting from valley deepening. The tide gauge records for Mangalore and Madras show a relative fall in sea-level. Occurrence of a dead oyster colony above the intertidal zone substantiates the tide gauge data. These observations indicate that the continental crust close to Mulki-Pulicat Lake axis is undergoing compression and uplift, related to the north-south oriented regional stress field.						, K R Subrahmanya/0000-0003-4321-2751													0040-1951					SEP 30	1996	262	1-4					231	241		10.1016/0040-1951(96)00005-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0040-1951(96)00005-4													WOS:A1996VR77900014

Water samples were collected from the deepest portion of each lake and analyzed for ions and other water chemistry parameters. Benthic invertebrates were collected front the littoral zone using both a sweep net and Hess sampler. Physical and geographical measurements were derived from maps. Relationships among benthic invertebrate assemblages and environmental variables were examined using canonical correspondence analysis, and the importance of sampling methodology and taxonomic resolution on these relationships was evaluated. Choice of sampling methodology strongly influenced the outcome of statistical analyses, whereas taxonomic resolution did not. Presence/absence of benthic invertebrate taxa among the study lakes was best explained by elevation and presence of fish. Relative abundance and density of benthic invertebrate taxa were more strongly influenced by sampling date and water chemistry. Nitrate (NO3-) concentration, potentially on the rise due to regional nitrogen deposition, was unrelated to benthic invertebrate distribution regardless of sampling method or taxonomic resolution.

J	Gophen, M				Gophen, Moshe			Effects of Climate Conditions on TP Outsourcing in Lake Kinneret (Israel)	CLIMATE												Since the mid-1980s, significant changes in climate conditions have occurred, and trends of dryness in the Kinneret drainage basin have been documented, including a temperature increase and precipitation decline. The precipitation decline, and consequently the reduction in river discharge, resulted in a decrease in TP (total phosphorus) flux into Lake Kinneret. After the drainage of the Hula natural wetlands and old Lake Hula during the 1950s, the ecological characteristics of the Hula Valley were modified. Nutrient fluxes downstream into Lake Kinneret were therefore predicted. The impacts of climate conditions (precipitation and discharge) on TP (total phosphorus) outsourcing through erosive action are significant: higher and lower discharge enhances and reduces TP load, respectively. The total TP flushing range from the Hula Valley peat soil through the subterranean medium and where TP is directed are not precisely known but are probably outside Lake Kinneret. Most runoff water and mediated TP originates from bedrock through erosive action. Long-term records of TP concentrations in headwaters and potential resources in the Hula Valley confirmed the significant influence of climate conditions on the outsourcing of TP capacity. The impacts of agricultural development, external fertilizer loads and migratory cranes in the winter are probably insignificant.

Boomerang ecosystem fluxes: organic carbon inputs from land to lakes are returned to terrestrial food webs via aquatic insects	OIKOS												Many ecosystems are linked to their adjacent ecosystems by movements of organisms. For instance, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are linked via emerging aquatic insects that serve as prey for terrestrial consumers. However, the role of these organisms in returning recycled carbon to the ecosystem from which it originated is not well known. This is due to the fact that values of carbon isotope signatures from terrestrial leaves and aquatic resources are usually similar and hence results of isotope mixing models need to be considered with caution. We overcame this problem by adding isotopically distinct terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) as a tracer to the experimental sides of two lakes that were divided in two equal halves with plastic curtains. We focused on aquatic insect larvae (Chironomidae) that fed on maize Zea mays leaves experimentally added to the lakes, and subsequently became prey for terrestrial predators (spiders) after emergence. The carbon isotope values of Chironomidae and spiders were significantly elevated in the lake treatment sides as compared to reference sides, whereas the values of all autochthonous resources were not affected by maize additions. Estimates from stable isotope mixing models indicated a low but demonstrable contribution of maize leaves to the diet of Chironomidae. Overlap between the isotope values of alder leaves, the major natural tPOC source, and autochthonous resources prevented a reliable quantification of allochthony of Chironomidae. However, we qualitatively demonstrated the flow of terrestrial particulate organic carbon to lakes, as leaf fall, and back to terrestrial surroundings via emerging insects. This boomerang' carbon flux between land and lakes blurs the distinction between autochthonous and allochthonous carbon sources.

To better understand the evolution of glaciers and the impact of this on proglacial lakes, seven glaciers corresponding to continenntal, subcontinental, and marine climate types that are influenced by westerlies and the Indian summer monsoon were selected for study. The evolution of the edges of these glaciers and their associated proglacial lakes were identified based on the visual interpretation of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. A dataset covering the period 1976-2020 that included the glacier and proglacial lake edge vectors was then created. The relative errors in the areas of the individual glaciers were less than 3%, and for the proglacial lakes these errors were in the range 0%-7%. The dataset was used to effectively compare the changes in glaciers and proglacial lakes that have occurred over the past four decades. The most striking changes that were found were the retreat of glaciers and the formation of small proglacial lakes. This dataset could also be used as a proxy to support research on changes in mountain glaciers, particularly their response to climate change and water resources.

J	Fuller, JA				Fuller, JA			Bank recession and lakebed downcutting; Response to changing water levels at Maumee Bay State Park, Ohio	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The shore and nearshore area of Maumee Bay, at the western end of Lake Erie, was studied from 1981 to 1990 and this report documents the impact of water levels on bank recession and lakebed downcutting. The shore of Maumee Bay is composed of a low bank of sand-poor glacial lacustrine silt and clay. Three regimes of lake level occurred during this 9-year study. Each regime produced a different character and rate of erosion. During stable lake levels, erosion occurred as bank recession and as nearshore lakebed downcutting. During rising/high lake levels, bank recession continued, but lakebed downcutting slowed except at the new transgressed shoreline. During falling water levels, bank recession all but ceased, the former shoreline became emergent and lakebed downcutting resumed. Over the 9 years of this study, total bank recession averaged about 20 m and nearshore lakebed downcutting averaged about 50 cm. At lower lake levels the visual (from land) erosion ceased and lakebed downcutting became dominant, which continued to deepen the nearshore. Therefore, when higher lake levels return, waves in the deeper water will have an even greater impact on bank recession rates.																			0380-1330						2002	28	3					352	361		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70590-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70590-X													WOS:000178250700005

The concentrations of these heavy metals and their seasonal variations were discussed by correlating with the lake's water temperature, pH, and rainfall. The results showed that the weekly Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, and Cd concentrations ranged from 0.31 to 1.10 mu g/L, 0.10 to 2.03 mu g/L, 0.01 to 0.50 mu g/L, 0.39 to 2.71 mu g/L, and 0.00 to 0.86 mu g/L, respectively. The mean annual metal concentrations of lake water were in decreasing order of Cr > Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd and within the permissible levels of national water quality guidelines. There was no significant seasonal variation in the heavy metal concentration between the wet and dry seasons. However, except for Cr, the other metals' mean concentrations were slightly higher in the wet season than the dry season, likely due to rainfall-related inputs. Based on correlation analysis, water temperature and pH may have influenced the concentrations of Zn and Cu, respectively, while the concentration of both metals was not affected by rainfall and showed high fluctuations throughout the sampling period, suggesting airborne related dust source inputs. Conversely, Pb concentration was influenced mainly by rainfall and temperature and is likely rain-related source inputs. Meanwhile, the negative correlation between the Cr concentration and pH value of lake water suggests that Cr is mainly derived from sediments. In contrast, the Cd concentration is not related to these factors as its content is generally a reflection of background value. Finally, the characteristics of these five heavy metals in this closed hydrological system of the Huguang Maar Lake suggest that atmospheric deposition and weathering-related inputs are important in evaluating heavy metal concentration levels in a close lake system for sustainable protection of its ecosystem.

Therefore, the search for life on these icy worlds is anchored on the study of terrestrial extreme environments (termed "analogue sites"), which harbor microorganisms at the frontiers of polyextremophily. These so-called extremophiles have been found in areas previously considered sterile: hot springs, hydrothermal vents, acidic or alkaline lakes, hypersaline environments, deep sea sediments, glaciers, and arid areas, amongst others. Such model systems and communities in extreme terrestrial environments may provide important information relevant to the astrobiology of icy bodies, including the composition of potential biological communities and the identification of biosignatures that they may produce. Extremophiles can use either sunlight (phototrophs) or chemical energy (chemotrophs) as energy sources, and different chemical compounds as electron donors or acceptors. Aerobic microorganisms use oxygen (O-2) as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas anaerobic microorganisms may use nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO4(2)(-)), carbon dioxide (CO2), Fe(III), or other organic or inorganic molecules during respiration. The phylogenetic diversity of extremophiles is very high, leading to their broad dispersal across the phylogenetic tree of life together with a wide variety in metabolic diversity. Some metabolisms are specific to archaea, for example, methanogenesis, an anaerobic respiration during which methane (CH4) is produced. Also sulfur-reduction performed by some bacteria and archaea is considered as a primitive metabolism which is restricted to anoxic sulfur-rich habitats in nature. Methanogenesis and sulfur reduction are of specific interest for icy moon research as it might be one of the few known terrestrial metabolisms possible on these celestial bodies. Therefore, the adaptation of these intriguing microorganisms to extreme conditions will be highlighted within this review.					; Antunes, André/A-8711-2012; Rittmann, Simon/D-6205-2013; Rittmann, Simon K.-M.

J	SARNELLE, O				SARNELLE, O			FIELD ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF PHYTOPLANKTONIC FOOD AVAILABLE TO DAPHNIA AND BOSMINA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												There is conflicting evidence regarding the food value of many types of phytoplankton available to cladoceran grazers. Measurement of feeding or assimilation can give a misleading impression of a grazer''s ability to grow and reproduce on a particular food. To assess the food quality of phytoplankton in a pair of meso-eutrophic lakes, a cladoceran fecundity index (SBS) was generated from brood size-carapace length data for three species, and was correlated with phytoplankton abundance in size classes and food-quality categories based on taxonomy and digestibility. Phytoplankton size had a decisive influence on SBS for Bosmina longirostris, but not for Daphnia catawba or Daphnia parvula, reflecting Bosmina''s smaller food size range. Correlations of SBS with phytoplankton in five categories indicated that naked flagellates (excluding Cryptophyceae), diatoms and digestible green algae wer probably high in food value to these grazers, while cryptomonads and resistant green algae probably were not. Mid-summer crashes in cladoceran fecundity were associated with qualitative shifts in the phytoplankton communities toward dominance by Cryptomonas or Crucigenia. Daphnia catawba was apparently able to utilize large colonial algae that its competitor, B. longirostris, could not.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 15	1986	131	1					47	56		10.1007/BF00008323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008323													WOS:A1986AYR3500005

Consequences of introducing the invasive amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus into large shallow Lake Peipsi: present distribution and possible effects on fish food	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					International Conference and Workshop on Managing Alien Species for Sustainable Development of Aquaculture and Fisheries	NOV 05-07, 2008	Univ Florence, Florence, ITALY		Univ Florence			The objective of the study was to assess the effect of the Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus, a successful invader into Europe, as a fish food source in Lake Peipsi to where it was introduced in the 1970s. In 2002-2006, the littoral macrozoobenthos was studied along 17 transects (0.1-4 m depth, 384 quantitative samples) to determine the recent distribution of G. fasciatus and its share in the benthic community. Earlier records on the littoral macrozoobenthos from the years 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000 were also used for comparison. Our results indicate that the invasive G. fasciatus is the dominant species (about 43% of total macrozoobenthos abundance) in the littoral zone of Lake Peipsi, while the native gammarids Gammarus lacustris and Pallasea quadrispinosa appear to be extinct and oligochaetes seem to have declined. G. fasciatus preferred hard substrates and it was mainly distributed close to water shallow beach areas (water depth < 0.2 m), where its abundance reached locally up to 29 000 ind. m(-2) (97% of total macrozoobenthos abundance). This distribution pattern of the invader in summer makes it mostly inaccessible for adult fish and increases its survival rate. Being highly mobile, G. fasciatus is not sensitive to water level fluctuations in shallow lakes. These behavioural characteristic increase its population success.

Comparing population-level patterns across systems revealed that the density of largemouth bass adults (above some minimum threshold) has little impact on recruitment strength. Whereas populations dominated by large adults may result in early hatched, rapidly growing, and ultimately more successful offspring in natural lakes, this phenomenon is not apparent in reservoirs. At-the community level, prey assemblage character affects largemouth bass recruitment. In systems dominated by sunfish, a primary prey and a protracted spawner, growth of age-0 largemouth bass is largely regulated by the availability of late-hatched offspring. In systems dominated by gizzard shad, growth of age-0 largemouth bass is regulated by complex ecosystem-level interactions that vary along environmental gradients. Total phosphorus affects success of age-0 gizzard shad, thereby mediating its role as competitor or prey. Spring temperatures and water-level fluctuations further complicate these biotic interactions among age-0 fishes. Quantifying how early food-web interactions are driven by local responses to large-scale, watershed-level processes (which influence nutrients, water levels, etc.) will provide mechanistic insight into the recruitment dynamics of largemouth bass.

Abundances of microbial plankton were determined which allowed a delineation of the pelagic food web structure. We also report the nutrient status of these lakes. We demonstrate the occurrence of a trophic gradient that extended from upland lakes (oligotrophic) to the coastal ones (eutrophic). The study shows that a lake's morphology regulates the relative importance of the pelagic and benthic habitats, whereas nutrient loads mainly determine its trophic status. Yet, some of the variability observed could be also a legacy of the landscape. Photosynthetic pigments analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography of the lake waters revealed a major occurrence of chlorophytes, chrysophytes and diatoms. The chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes in the central plateau were consistently lower (<2.5mg l(-1)) than coastal sites, which were one order of magnitude higher. Numbers of both bacterioplankton and autotrophic picoplankton also increased from inland to coastal sites. However, the relative role of autotrophic picoplankton in the total phytoplankton assemblage decreased with the increase in nutrients loads. Our results show that the trophic status clearly plays a significant role in structuring the pelagic communities of these lakes despite climatic constraints.					; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013; Rochera, Carlos/M-2932-2014; Mozo, Antonio/AAE-3707-2020; Rico, Eugenio/L-2429-2013	Picazo Mozo, Antonio/0000-0002-7572-9686; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993; Rochera, Carlos/0000-0002-8294-4755; Toro Velasco, Manuel/0000-0002-4860-7229; Rico, Eugenio/0000-0001-6978-645X													0954-1020	1365-2079				APR	2013	25	2			SI		277	287		10.1017/S0954102012000971	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102012000971													WOS:000316479700015

If the summertime water level is raised, intensive erosion processes. begin, causing a sudden decline in shore vegetation. The need for shore protection is obvious in areas of high recreational value. At lake Ontojarvi, planting experiments with littoral helophytes and bushes were carried out during the years 1990-92. All the experiments were carried out in the eroded sandy areas, which were partly protected by mechanical barriers. Several plant species were planted on the shore which had been treated with different peat mixtures, etc. The frequencies of the different species were followed monthly. After the first summer, the average survival rates were about 45 % due to the drying of seedlings. A rapid decrease in the survival rates took place during the high water level period in 1991 at which point only 20% of the planted individuals were alive. The best results were obtained for the helophyte Carer rostrata Stokes, of which 30% had survived erosion. Tall willows (Salix phylicifolia L.) were also erosion-resistant with a survival rate of 80%.

The catalytic effect of bound extracellular polymeric substances excreted by anaerobic microorganisms on Ca-Mg carbonate precipitation: Implications for the "dolomite problem"	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST												Because of its rare occurrence in modern sediments, as well as the difficulty in synthesizing it under low-temperature conditions in the laboratory, the origin of sedimentary dolomite has remained a long-standing enigma, often referred to as the "dolomite problem." Recently, anaerobic microorganisms, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens, have been recognized for mediating dolomite precipitation. However, the exact role of microorganisms in dolomite crystallization is still under debate and the possible involvement of anaerobic fermenting bacteria has not been studied. In this study, we characterized the effect of purified non-metabolizing biomass and bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of a natural consortium of anaerobic microorganisms dominated by fermenting bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria on Ca-Mg carbonate precipitation. This natural consortium was enriched from sediments of Deep Springs Lake, California, where dolomite is still precipitating. Our data show that disordered dolomite, a precursor of some sedimentary stoichiometric ordered dolomite, can be precipitated in calcite-seeded Ca-Mg carbonate solutions containing purified non-metabolizing consortium biomass. Bound EPS extracted from the consortium culture were shown to be the active component that triggered the crystallization of disordered dolomite. Further experiments show that purified non-metabolizing biomass from pure cultures of both anaerobic fermenting and sulfate-reducing bacteria closely related to those organisms present in the consortium could also catalyze the precipitation of disordered dolomite. This study contributes to the understanding of the "dolomite problem" by revealing (1) the catalytic effect of bound EPS on Ca-Mg carbonate crystallization and (2) the possible involvement of anaerobic fermenting bacteria in sedimentary dolomite formation, which has not been reported previously.

This study sought to understand the sources of E. coli in Dunes Creek's central branch. A systematic survey of random and fixed sampling points of water and sediment was conducted over 3 years. E. coli concentrations in Dunes Creek and beach water were significantly correlated. Weekly monitoring at 14 stations during 1999 and 2000 indicated chronic loading of E. coli throughout the stream. Significant correlations between E. coli numbers in stream water and stream sediment, submerged sediment and margin, and margin and 1 m from shore were found. Median E. coli counts were highest in stream sediments, followed by bank sediments, sediments along spring margins, stream water, and isolated pools; in forest soils, E. coli counts were more variable and relatively lower. Sediment moisture was significantly correlated with E. coli counts. Direct fecal input inadequately explains the widespread and consistent occurrence of E. coli in the Dunes Creek watershed; long-term survival or multiplication or both seem likely. The authors conclude that (i) E. coli is ubiquitous and persistent throughout the Dunes Creek basin, (ii) E. coli occurrence and distribution in riparian sediments help account for the continuous loading of the bacteria in Dunes Creek, and (iii) ditching of the stream, increased drainage, and subsequent loss of wetlands may account for the chronically high E. coli levels observed.

However, the complex hydrogeological attributes of these systems, linked to extremely fast aquifer recharge processes and flow through well-connected conduit networks, often present difficulty in predicting how they will respond to changing climatological conditions. This study investigates the predicted impacts of climate change on a lowland karst catchment by using a semi-distributed pipe network model of the karst aquifer populated with output from the high spatial resolution (4 km) Consortium for Small-scale Modelling Climate Lokalmodell (COSMO-CLM) regional climate model simulations for Ireland. An ensemble of projections for the future Irish climate were generated by downscaling from five different global climate models (GCMs), each based on four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) to account for the uncertainty in the estimation of future global emissions of greenhouse gases. The onedimensional hydraulic/hydrologic karst model incorporates urban drainage software to simulate open channel and pressurised flow within the conduits, with flooding on the land surface represented by storage nodes with the same stage volume properties of the physical turlough basins. The lowland karst limestone catchment is located on the west coast of Ireland and is characterised by a well-developed conduit-dominated karst aquifer which discharges to the sea via intertidal and submarine springs. Annual above ground flooding associated with this complex karst system has led to the development of unique wetland ecosystems in the form of ephemeral lakes known as turloughs; however, extreme flooding of these features causes widespread damage and disruption in the catchment. This analysis has shown that mean, 95th and 99th percentile flood levels are expected to increase by significant proportions for all future emission scenarios. The frequency of events currently considered to be extreme is predicted to increase, indicating that more significant groundwater flooding events seem likely to become far more common. The depth and duration of flooding is of extreme importance, both from an ecological perspective in terms of wetland species distribution and for extreme flooding in terms of the disruption to homes, transport links and agricultural land inundated by flood waters. The seasonality of annual flooding is also predicted to shift later in the flooding season, which could have consequences in terms of ecology and land use in the catchment. The investigation of increasing mean sea levels, however, showed that anticipated rises would have very little impact on groundwater flooding due to the marginal impact on ebb tide outflow volumes. Overall, this study highlights the relative vulnerability of lowland karst systems to future changing climate conditions, mainly due to the extremely fast recharge which can occur in such systems. The study presents a novel and highly effective methodology for studying the impact of climate change in lowland karst systems by coupling karst hydrogeological models with the output from high-resolution climate simulations.

Eight stages in lagoon development mainly controlled by sea level fluctuations were inferred. Lagoon salinity was highest during the maximum of the Holocene transgression. The lagoon developed into a brackish lake at similar to 5090 cal yr BP and became completely fresh at similar to 4090 cal yr BP. The sedimentation rate decreased around 3510 cal yr BP, which coincided with a weakening of the summer monsoon. A swamp formed during the last 700 years. The data suggest that natural factors were the main controls on the observed changes in the landscape. Pollen analysis indicates periods of increased proportions of thermophilic species in the broadleaf forests. Pollen data indicate appearance of Korean pine and fir, role oak and birches, and changes of the plant community on the coast. First notable human impact on the vegetation coincided with the Neolithic colonization of the coastal area. Evidence of fires between similar to 5500 and 4920 cal yr BP was possibly associated with human activities. Human impact on the vegetation increased markedly in the late 19th century.					; Ganzei, Kirill/P-3262-2016; Razjigaeva, Nadezhda/K-2951-2018	Grebennikova, Tat'ana/0000-0002-5805-391X; Razzigaeva, Nadezda/0000-0001-7936-1797; 													1367-9120	1878-5786				AUG 1	2020	197								104386	10.1016/j.jseaes.2020.104386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2020.104386													WOS:000538826300004

Persistence of Avian Influenza Viruses in Lake Sediment, Duck Feces, and Duck Meat	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The persistence of 3 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) (H4N6, H5N1, and H6N8) and one human influenza virus (H1N1) as well as Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and enteric cytopathogenic bovine orphan (ECBO) virus was investigated in lake sediment, duck feces, and duck meat at 30, 20, 10, and 0 degrees C using a germ carrier technique. Virus-loaded germ carriers were incubated in each substrate, and residual infectivity of the eluted virus was quantified on cell culture after regular intervals for a maximum of 24 weeks. Data were analyzed by a linear regression model to calculate T-90 values (time required for 90% loss of virus infectivity) and estimated persistence of the viruses. In general, the persistence of all of the viruses was highest in lake sediment, followed by feces, and was the lowest in duck meat at all temperatures. For the avian influenza virus subtypes, T-90 values in sediment ranged from 5 to 11, 13 to 18, 43 to 54, and 66 to 394 days at 30, 20, 10, and 0 degrees C, respectively, which were 2 to 5 times higher than the T-90 values of the viruses in the feces and meat. Although the individual viruses vary in tenacity, the survival time of influenza viruses was shorter than that of NDV and ECBO virus in all substrates. The results of this study suggest that lake sediment may act as a long-term source of influenza viruses in the aquatic habitat, while the viruses may remain infectious for extended periods of time in duck feces and meat at low temperatures, allowing persistence of the viruses in the environment over winter.

Both land and water forms of Lobelia have short stiff leaves which lack stomata and are covered by a thick cuticle providing high resistance to gas exchange and water loss. Incessant large air lacunae run between leaf and root.tips. With the leaves exposed to atmospheric air, both life forms absorb virtually all CO2 by the roots from the CO2-rich sediments (ca 30 times air level) and release a substantial proportion of the O2 produced during photosynthesis. The thick cuticle and lack of stomata maintain high CO2 concentrations (ca 23 times air level) for photosynthesis within the leaf lacunae. Release of O2 via the roots and low O2 consumption rates in the sandy sediments result in the presence of dissolved O2 in the pore water and higher daytime concentrations than during night. Root oxygenation may assist in the acquisition of limiting nutrient resources in the infertile habitat. We propose that the special morphology and the predominant root exchange of CO2 and O2 evolved on land before Lobelia dortmanna became submerged.

The general aim is to reconcile two apparently contradictory concepts-(1) conservation and protection and (2) creative intervention-in order to: (i) restore the site''s urban character; (ii) preserve and strengthen the natural, historical and cultural memory of the area (it was once a lively and much-used area of natural springs and shallow lakes); (iii) make the site available to the townspeople and bring it back to life in a contemporary way; (iv) make the most of its protential as a site for the city''s future social and cultural activities. The approach in question is an application of a "socio-ecological and perceptual" landscape analysis, intended to "read" the identity and the specific character, the "spirit" of the place, projecting an image onto it, in order to create a new situation out of an interactive and continuous process.																			0169-2046	1872-6062				APR	1990	19	1					69	97		10.1016/0169-2046(90)90036-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-2046(90)90036-2													WOS:A1990DB08500005

Spatial and Seasonal Variations in Dissolved Methane Across a Large Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes process large volumes of organic carbon (OC), are important sources of methane (CH4), and contribute to climatic warming. However, there is a lack of data from large lakes >500 km(2), which creates uncertainty in global budgets. In this data article, we present dissolved CH4, OC bioreactivity measurements, water chemistry, and algal biovolumes at 11 stations across Lake Malaren, the third largest (1,074 km(2)) Swedish lake. Total phosphorus concentrations show that during the study period the lake was classed as mesotrophic/eutrophic. Overall mean CH4 concentration from all stations, sampled five times to cover seasonal variation, was 2.51 mu g l(-1) (0.98-5.39 mu g l(-1)). There was no significant seasonal variation although ranges were greatest during summer. Concentrations of CH4 were greatest in shallow waters close to anthropogenic nutrient sources, whilst deeper, central basins had lower concentrations. Methane correlated positively with measures of lake productivity (chlorophyll a, total phosphorus), and negatively to water depth and oxygen concentration, with oxygen emerging as the sole significant driver in a linear mixed effects model. We collated data from other lakes >500 km(2) (n = 21) and found a significant negative relationship between surface area and average CH4 concentration. Large lakes remain an understudied contributor to the global CH4 cycle and future research efforts should aim to quantify the spatial and temporal variation in their diffusive and ebullitive emissions, and associated drivers. Plain Language Summary Lakes contribute to climatic warming, because they emit large amounts of the powerful greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere. This occurs because lake bottom sediments and lake waters are home to microbes that produce methane, which then travels diffusively in a dissolved form, or as bubbles, through the lake water and into the air. There is large uncertainty about how much methane is released by lakes on a global scale, and more measurements are required to reduce this uncertainty, particularly from very large lakes. In our study, we measured dissolved methane from 11 sampling locations across a very large Swedish lake, and repeated this five times over a year. Levels of methane within the lake were generally low, but they varied over space and time. Higher methane levels occurred in shallower waters near large towns and cities, and were associated with greater concentrations of nutrients such as phosphorus, which act as food for the methane-producing microbes.

Due to the lake of genomic information, molecular mechanisms triggering endodormancy release in flower buds have remained unclear. Hence, we used Illumina RNA-Seq technology to carry out de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression profiling of flower buds. Approximately 47 million clean reads were assembled into 50,604 sequences with an average length of 837 bp. A total of 37,650 unigene sequences were successfully annotated. 128 pathways were annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and metabolic, biosynthesis of second metabolite and plant hormone signal transduction accounted for higher percentage in flower bud. In critical period of endodormancy release, 1644, significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from expression profile. DEGs related to oxidoreductase activity were especially abundant in Gene Ontology (GO) molecular function category. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were involved in various metabolic processes, including phytohormone metabolism. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that levels of DEGs for abscisic acid and gibberellin biosynthesis decreased while the abundance of DEGs encoding their degradation enzymes increased and GID1 was down-regulated. Concomitant with endodormancy release, MADS-box transcription factors including P. pseudocerasus dormancy-associated MADS-box (PpcDAM), Agamous-like2, and APETALA3-like genes, shown remarkably epigenetic roles. The newly generated transcriptome and gene expression profiling data provide valuable genetic information for revealing transcriptomic variation during bud dormancy in Chinese cherry. The uncovered data should be useful for future studies of bud dormancy in Prunus fruit trees lacking genomic information. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Males were exclusively feeding on algae and mosses, while females also included grasses and forbs in their diet. The % of feeding specimens was 12.8%. A clear correlation between temperature and feeding was found. On a cool day only 1% of the specimens were feeding, while on the warmest day it were 24.7%. The same correlation was found for foraging, but not for any other behaviour. Feeding occurred more often during sunny conditions at locations with high insolation and temperature. Tetrix subulata sat more often on open soil and grass litter than it was present in the habitat, but less common on grasses and forbs. The feeding locations differed significantly from the locations of non-feeding specimens. Feeding took place on open soil, mosses and leaf litter. In conclusion it can be said that damp, open patches, exposed to sun are important structural features (probably key factors) of the habitat of Tetrix subulata. This stresses the need of disturbances in wet meadows and flat, open shores at lakes, rivers, ditches and streams.

According to the Piper diagram, Ca 2 + -Mg 2 + -HCO 3 - hydrochemical facies is dominant due to calcium carbonate dissolution in the geological formations of the study area. The wetland water had a natural to slightly alkaline pH. Although TDS and EC of the water samples fall under freshwater category, their values were higher downstream of the wetland as a result of stagnant water, low water depth, more evaporation, and impact of agricultural runoff. Based on the water quality index (WQI), all water samples were 'suitable' for irrigation purposes, while 50% of the samples were 'unsuitable' for drinking. Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI), and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) also indicated suitability of the wetland water for irrigation. According to the Wilcox diagram, salinity is higher downstream of the wetland due to introduction of agricultural runoff. It can be concluded that the wetland water could be used for irrigational purposes, but regular monitoring is recommended to promote sustainable use of natural resources and conserve the vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.

Egg attachment was reduced by 73% on spawning substrata with a natural periphytic biofilm, compared to clean substrata. Overall, this initial difference in egg numbers persisted until hatching. The difference in egg numbers was even increased in the wave treatment, while it was reduced in the no-wave control treatment. Exposure to a low-intensity wave regime affected egg development between the two biofilm treatments differently. Waves enhanced egg survival on substrata without a biofilm but reduced the survival of eggs on substrata with biofilm coverage. In the treatment combining biofilm-covered substrata and waves, no attached eggs survived until hatching. In all treatments, more than 75% of the eggs became detached from the spawning substrata during the egg incubation period, and < 1% of these detached eggs survived within the substratum interstices. Hence, detached eggs contributed little to the reproductive success we observed. The implications of these results on the spawning success of fish species that use freshly inundated spawning substrata in shallow waters are discussed.

The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 resulted in massive socio-economic and institutional transformations that triggered changes in the LU/LC. The paper analyses the processes of land use/cover change in the shore zone of 145 lakes of the Olsztyn Lakeland in north-eastern Poland based on GIS data sets over a period of 30 years. This is a new approach aimed at analysing qualitative, quantitative and spatial changes in the shore zone of lakes related to socio-economic transformation in Poland. A very large decrease in agricultural land area was noted, which is currently an economically marginal class of land use in the shore zone of lakes. The decrease in the agricultural land area was related to a significant increase in the residential construction development and the process of afforestation. While the conversion of agricultural land was a positive phenomenon from the environmental point of view, the main threat to the shore zone of lakes was the expansion of settlement. Our results also showed a negative correlation between the surface of urban areas and the surface occupied by tourist accommodation facilities. This fact indicates a cross functional conflict between the settlement and tourism functions of the area in the lake shore zone. The results also indicate that the changes in the tourist accommodation base were mainly of a qualitative and spatial nature. This is probably due to a change in tourist preferences in terms of accommodation standards.					; Jankun, Malgorzata/D-1625-2012	Jankun-Woznicka, Malgorzata/0000-0001-6785-3591; Furgala-Selezniow, Grazyna/0000-0003-0324-1726; 													0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2020	90								104350	10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104350													WOS:000503093800048
J	Welch, SJ; Jones, SS; Allen, T				Welch, Shari J.; Jones, Spencer S.; Allen, Todd			Mapping the 24-Hour Emergency Department Cycle to Improve Patient Flow	JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY												Background: Intermountain Healthcare (Salt Lake City), in conjunction with emergency department (ED) staff at LDS Hospital, designed an integrated patient tracking system (PTS) and a specialized data repository (ED Data Mart) that was part of an overall enterprisewide data warehouse. After two years of internal beta testing the PTS and its associated data captures, an analysis of various ED operations by time of day was undertaken. Methods: Real-time data, concurrent with individual ED patient encounters from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005 were included in a retrospective analysis. Results: A number of patterns were revealed that provide a starting point for understanding ED processes and flow. In particular, ED census, acuity, operations, and throughput vary with the time of day. For example, patients seen during low-census times, in the middle of the night, appear to have a higher acuity. Radiology and laboratory utilization were highly correlated with ED arrivals, and the higher the acuity, the greater the utilization. Discussion: Although it is unclear whether or not these patterns will be applicable to other hospitals in and out of the cohort of tertiary care hospitals, ED cycle data can help all facilities anticipate the resources needed and the services required for efficient patient flow. For example, the fact that scheduling of most service departments falls off after 5: 00 P. M., just when the ED is most in need of those services, illustrates a fundamental mismatch between service capacity and demand.

J	BLACKETT, RF				BLACKETT, RF			DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF AN ALASKA STEEPPASS FISHWAY FOR SOCKEYE-SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A major introduced run of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) at Frazer Lake, Kodiak Island, Alaska, is perpetuated by an Alaska steeppass fishway at a 10-m-high falls on the outlet river. Experimental modifications of the fishway, which was inadequate by 1970 as the salmon run increased, improved salmon entry and passage. Sockeye passage over 4 yr was nearly equivalent in a steeppass of 60 m continuous length (22% slope) and an adjoining steeppass with three resting pools, but significant year-to-year differences in passage occurred between steeppasses. Resting tanks were beneficial for holding slower or descending salmon without blocking passage of other salmon. An average entry of 142 sockeye in 15 min was achieved by guiding all salmon along a weir to an entrance tank with a vertical slot orifice. Chutes installed in the entry end of the steeppasses created a high-velocity stream for attraction and decreased salmon dropout from the entrance tank. Salmon passage in the original steeppasses with three pools was greater than in new (1979) steeppasses with a single resting pool. In 1985, sockeye passage of 2925/h and 46 806/d exceeded fishway capacity requirements.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1987	44	1					66	76		10.1139/f87-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-008													WOS:A1987G059200007

The coolest of the lakes remains Lake Slesinskie, while the warmest is Lake Lichenskie. Both of the lakes are eutrophic, and their ecological potential is decidedly below good. Low water retention in the lakes facilitates the increase of easily absorbed organic matter flowing in from the catchment area, and the higher temperatures of the waters intensify processes of their decomposition. Summer phytoplankton blooms are noted in both lakes; they are more intense in Lake Lichenskie. A significant increase in primary production, higher cyanobacteria biomass, and the limited development of large cladocerans and copepods and the domination of small rotifers are confirmed in this lake. The lake system is inhabited by approximately 100 alien species. These frequently include invasive plant and animal species such as Vallisneria spiralis, Dreissena polymorpha, Sinanodonta woodiana, and Pseudorasbora parva, which contribute to the structure and functioning of the lakes. The best water quality is in the post-mining water basin, which was created in 2010 by inundating it with Early Cretaceous and Tertiary waters, the physicochemical and biological aspect of which indicate good or maximum ecological potential.					; Kapusta, Andrzej/GVS-3584-2022; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Bogacka-Kapusta, Elzbieta/0000-0002-6146-5229; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Kapusta, Andrzej/0000-0001-8979-5468; Babko, Roman/0000-0002-3292-5580													1433-6863		978-3-030-12123-5; 978-3-030-12122-8				2020	86						321	349		10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5_16	10.1007/978-3-030-12123-5												WOS:000487329500018
J	Sánchez-Hernández, J; Amundsen, PA				Sanchez-Hernandez, Javier; Amundsen, Per-Arne			Trophic ecology of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in subarctic lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												In subarctic lake systems, fish species like brown trout are often important predators, and their niche performance is a key characteristic for understanding trophic interactions and food web functioning at upper trophic levels. Here, we studied summer habitat use and stomach contents of brown trout under both allopatric and sympatric conditions in six subarctic lakes to reveal its trophic role, and population- and individual-level niche plasticity. In allopatry, brown trout mainly used the littoral habitat, but also less commonly used the pelagic zone. In sympatry with stickleback, there was always a considerable habitat overlap between the two species. In contrast, sympatric populations of brown trout and Arctic charr generally revealed a distinct habitat segregation. In the sympatric systems, in general, there was a distinct resource partitioning between the trout and charr, whereas the observed diet overlap between trout and stickleback was much larger. Trout modified their individual dietary specialisation between the littoral and pelagic zone, always being lower in the pelagic. Piscivorous behaviour of trout was only found in sympatric systems, possibly contributing to a competitive advantage of trout over charr and stickleback. Hence, the trophic level of trout was strongly related to the fish community composition, with a higher trophic level in sympatric systems where piscivorous behaviour was frequent. These changes in the trophic level of trout linked with the observed food resource partitioning might be an important mechanism in the ecosystem functioning of subarctic lakes to allow coexistence among sympatric-living fish species.

Solutes carried by springs and rivers into the salars originate mostly from the alteration of the volcanic rocks and the re-solution of ancient buried evaporites. Both weathering and hydrothermal alteration lead to Na-HCO3 inflow waters of similar composition. High contents of lithium and boron are not specifically related to hydrothermal activity. Evaporite leaching leads to Na-Cl inflow waters of higher salinity. Atmospheric precipitation contributes only a small amount of Ca and SO4, and very little Na or Cl. The calculated evaporative evolution of the inflow waters shows that about half of them should become highly alkaline brines and the other half should end as near-neutral brines. However, alkaline soda lakes are rare in this region. Most lake brines are of the Na-Cl and Na-Cl-(SO4) types. To understand this anomaly one characteristic sequence of evaporating waters was studied in detail. Precipitation of calcite and Mg-smectites accounts only partially for the reduction of alkalinity. A further loss of alkalinity is probably related to the oxidation of wind-blown native sulfur in peripheral ponds. Wind-blown sulfur is also deposited around the lakes, on the drainage basins. In the rainy season, ephemeral streams carry along sulfur particles in permanent pools of the preconcentration areas. A hydrologic control of brine chemistry is suspected. Inflow waters, that should become alkaline, appear to evolve to neutral brines if they remain in contact with atmospheric dust and peripheral colluvium for a long time. On the contrary, inflow waters to soda lakes are generally close to the shore and have only minimal contact with atmospheric dust and peripheral sediments. Presently, all lakes are at relatively low levels, and inflow waters often drain an important area of the drainage basin before reaching the topographic low. In the past, lakes were at higher levels and less interaction occurred between inflow waters, atmospheric dust, and peripheral sediments. As a result, the chemistry of some lakes may have changed during the Quaternary.																			0016-7037	1872-9533				MAR	1991	55	3					687	705		10.1016/0016-7037(91)90334-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(91)90334-2													WOS:A1991FD75200005

Response in Growth, Scute Development, and Whole-Body Ion Composition of Acipenser fulvescens Reared in Water of Differing Chemistries	ANIMALS												In fishes, environmental ion availability can have substantial effects on growth and development. This study examined the development of Lake Sturgeon in response to the varying environmental ion availability that they experience as part of a conservation stocking program. We reared sturgeon in natural water from the Coosa River, which had higher concentrations of Mg2+, Na+, and Zn2+ than standard hatchery conditions, while [Ca2+] at the Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery was 2x higher than in the Coosa River. Eggs were hatched in each water type and the larvae were sampled at time points before and after yolk absorption during the first 8 weeks of development. Total length and weight in WSNFH larvae were significantly higher than larvae in Coosa River water starting at 8 dph, indicating that growth was dependent on the different environmental ion levels. Concentrations of the ions of interest were also determined for whole-body acid digests of the exposed Lake Sturgeon. We found that Lake Sturgeon reared in Coosa River water had significantly higher magnesium and zinc than Lake Sturgeon reared in WSNFH water (p < 0.05), while calcium was significantly higher in WSNFH than Coosa River water. This difference shows that different environmental ion concentrations also impact the overall development of larval Lake Sturgeon.					; Genz, Janet/AFN-3862-2022	Genz, Janet/0000-0001-5987-7972; 													2076-2615					MAY	2021	11	5							1419	10.3390/ani11051419	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11051419								34063440					WOS:000653345900001
J	Neale, PJ				Neale, PJ			Modeling the effects of ultraviolet radiation on estuarine phytoplankton production: impact of variations in exposure and sensitivity to inhibition	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY					Meeting on Stratospheric Processes and Their Role in Climate (SPARC)	NOV 09-11, 2000	MAR DEL PLATA, ARGENTINA					Spectral ultraviolet (UV) irradiance, water column attenuation and biological weighting functions for inhibition of phytoplankton photosynthesis have been measured for the Rhode River, a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. Together, these measurements can be used to estimate UV effects on water column production, but each factor shows a significant range of variability even just considering summer time conditions. A sensitivity analysis of UV inhibition is described which assesses the effect of this variation for different combinations of 28 irradiance spectra, 8 biological weighting functions (BWFs) and 16 water column irradiance profiles. Over all combinations, production averaged about 84% relative to potential production in the absence of UV effects. For a few combinations, relative production was as low as 67%, or as high as 97%, but for most combinations the range was 75-95%. Variations in the sensitivity of the phytoplankton assemblage, i.e. the BWF, and optical properties, represented by a transparency ratio of biologically effective UV to photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), had large effects on water column production. A simple relationship for UV inhibition of water column production is developed based on inhibition at the surface and the ratio of UV and PAR transparency. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BY.

J	Arjakas, K				Arjakas, Kullo			My Time as a Prisoner of War in Siberia and How I Made it to Freedom from There. Preface by Kullo Arjakas	TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI												On the night before 15 August 1943, Private Vaino Kaldma from Southern Estonia, who served in the Narva Estonian SS Volunteer Armoured Grenadier Battalion, was taken prisoner in Ukraine by Red Army soldiers. He claimed to be a Baltic German who had left Estonia in 1939. Kaldma reckoned that as an Estonian prisoner, the Soviet authorities would consider him a traitor of the homeland, while as a Baltic German he would be considered a soldier who had been mobilised according to ordinary procedures. In the Soviet justice system, prisoners of war were divided into two categories, 'foreign prisoners of war' and 'domestic prisoners of war, in other words the special contingent'. Prisoners were ordinarily taken to distribution camps, where Soviet citizens were sent to special camps. There the thorough investigation of 'betrayal of the homeland' began. The special camps were under the jurisdiction of the USSR NKVD Department of Special Camps. Other prisoners were sent to prisoner of war camps, where prisoners ended up in camps that were under the jurisdiction of the NKVD Department of Prisoners of War. Vaino Kaldma succeeded in concealing his ethnic origin and the trajectory of his military career. He was in Soviet prison camps for over two years, from where he was released in the autumn of 1945. Kaldma made it to Germany, headed onward to Belgium in 1947, and went from there to Canada. He wrote his memoirs at the end of 1946 and the start of 1947 at the DP (displaced persons) camp in Kassel-Oberzwehren, Germany. The manuscript of his memoirs is located at the Lakewood Archive in the United States of America.																			1406-4030						2022		1					94	+																WOS:000971555100007

Building partnerships to address conservation and management of western Michigan's natural resources	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Western Michigan's inventory of natural resources includes Great Lakes sand dunes; grasslands; forests; wetlands; lakes, rivers, and streams; shorelines and riparian habitats; and unique farmland. All of these environmental assets are under continuous threat of fragmentation and development, and numerous efforts have been undertaken to protect them. Many of these local and regional efforts include some level of stakeholder involvement. Collaboration between scientists and local decision makers to address complex environmental-policy problems is not new, and emphasis on stakeholder communication and participation in watershed management and policy development has been increasing. We examined the differences in tackling natural resource management issues through community and academic partnerships at the local and regional levels from the views of 3 researcher participants in 2 case studies. We used the engagement framework outlined in van Kerkhoff and Lebel (2006) as context for a discussion of 2 case studies. The 1st involved a hybrid integration funders and participation facilitators approach to stormwater management in the Spring Lake Watershed. The 2nd involved a translation specialists approach to valuing ecosystem services in a 7-county region that incorporated a negotiation lobby groups component in a parcel-level demonstration. These case studies highlight the challenges associated with each of these approaches and describe the partnerships that resulted from these efforts.

Physical, biogeochemical, and meteorological factors responsible for interannual changes in cyanobacterial community composition and biovolume over two decades in a eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study used a 20-year dataset (1995-2014) to identify factors affecting cyanobacterial community composition (CCC) and abundance in a eutrophic lake. We hypothesized that differences in thermal structure, nutrients, and meteorology drive interannual variability in CCC and abundance. Cluster analysis differentiated dominant cyanobacteria into rare, low abundance, or sporadically occurring taxa. The bloom-forming genera were Microcystis and Aphanizomenon, accounting for similar to 70% of total cyanobacterial biovolume (BV) on average, whereas unusually high abundance of Planktothrix, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria were clear outliers in three of the years. Variability in CCC was significantly correlated (P<0.05, R>0.3) with ice duration, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and spring nitrite+nitrate (NO2+3); ice duration and TKN were associated with the occurrence of primarily non-bloom-forming genera. Pairwise correlations tested linear, exponential, and polynomial correlates of absolute and relative total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, or Aphanizomenon BV. TKN, total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), TN:TP ratio, Schmidt stability, and rainfall correlated with total Cyanophyta, Microcystis, and Aphanizomenon BV, whereas ice cover, NO2+3, and TKN correlated with relative Microcystis and Aphanizomenon BV. Despite increasing TN:TP ratio over two decades, cyanobacterial abundance had not changed significantly. These data suggest differing responses of cyanobacterial genera to important environmental factors over two decades.

Survival of cabomba (Cabomba caroliniana) during lake drawdown within mounds of stranded vegetation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Control of submerged aquatic vegetation during drawdown is known to be hindered by mounds of stranded vegetation that protect underlying stems from desiccation. This study investigated the viability of stranded cabomba (Cabomba caroliniana) during a winter drawdown of Lake Benalla, Victoria, Australia. The viability of stems and crowns, determined by their ability to generate new shoots, was related to substrate exposure status, location in lake, mound height, and soil moisture, at 34 and 69days after exposure (DAE). Stem viability at 34 and 69 DAE was most closely associated with exposure status, where approximate to 20% of stems under mounds on relatively dry substrate were viable, compared to approximate to 95% of stems under mounds on saturated substrate, and 92% of unexposed stems. Stem viability was similar when collected 34 and 69 DAE and was similar under naturally occurring mounds of differing thickness. In contrast, viability of exposed crowns was usually 40% or less, compared to 72% for unexposed crowns, and their viability was not influenced by substrate moisture. Instead, their viability was influenced by location in the lake and was proportional to mound thickness. Like stems, viability of crowns did not decrease over the duration of the drawdown. We concluded that for drawdown to be effective in minimizing viable stems, the substrate below them needs to dry out. Even then, viable crowns may be a source of recolonization.					; butler, kym/D-5507-2014	Dugdale, Tony/0000-0001-9788-3185; butler, kym/0000-0002-1958-3942													1040-2381					MAR 1	2013	29	1					61	67		10.1080/10402381.2013.775198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2013.775198													WOS:000316910100006

Meteorological drivers of interannual variation in transparency of mountain lakes	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												In mountain lakes, water transparency is regulated primarily by materials loaded from the surrounding catchment. Consequently, transparency within a lake can vary over time due to meteorological conditions that affect hydrologic inputs. Furthermore, lake responses to these inputs may depend on catchment characteristics. We examined the relationships between meteorological conditions and interannual variation in transparency over thirteen years in a set of four lakes in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. We measured mid-summer transparency as the attenuation coefficient of 320 nm and collected meteorological data daily with an automatic weather station located near the study lakes. Despite their close proximity, lakes varied in the strength of associations between transparency and cumulative precipitation across a range of durations. Specifically, transparency in non-glacially fed Lake Hungabee was most strongly correlated with cumulative precipitation in the fifteen days preceding sampling, whereas glacially fed Lakes Opabin and Oesa were most strongly affected by longer periods of cumulative precipitation. Consequently, there was relatively little temporal synchrony in interannual transparency variation among lakes. Our results suggest that both the timing and amount of precipitation as well local hydrology must be considered when predicting effects of climate change on mountain lake ecosystems even within a single region.					; Hayashi, Masaki/E-2600-2012	, Janet/0000-0002-6779-2407; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 1	2020	52	1					424	434		10.1080/15230430.2020.1800972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2020.1800972													WOS:000563206300001

Despite the potential of Ra isotopes and Rn-222 as tracers of groundwater discharge, the use of these radionuclides to quantify the groundwater inflow in coastal wetlands has been only scarcely addressed in the literature. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the use of Rn-222 and Ra isotopes to estimate the contribution of distinct groundwater sources into a Mediterranean coastal wetland (the Peniscola marsh, Castello, Spain). The Peniscola marsh is a small shallow wetland nourished by groundwater coming from four different flowpaths: (i) a deep flow from the regional carbonate aquifer of El Maestrat, (ii) a shallow flow and (iii) an intermediate flow, both from the Irta Range and the detritic Vinaros-Peniscola aquifer, and (iv) seawater intrusion. Data on Ra-226, Rn-222 and salinity obtained in summer 2007 revealed that the deep groundwater contribution was 15% of the total water inflow, whereas the shallow and intermediate flow paths represented 32% and 48%, respectively. Seawater accounted only for the remaining 5% inputs to the wetland. Ra isotopes also allowed estimating the marsh water age in 1.2 days. Both the groundwater contributions derived from Rn-222 measurements and the Ra-derived marsh water age agreed well with the direct measurements obtained using propeller flow meters, evidencing the effectiveness of the used methods. An interannual comparison between the estimated groundwater inflow and the precipitation revealed that shallow groundwater flows respond to local precipitation, whereas the deep groundwater flow from the carbonate aquifer is dominated by a constant baseflow.

J	Dalzell, BJ; Mulla, DJ				Dalzell, B. J.; Mulla, D. J.			Perennial vegetation impacts on stream discharge and channel sources of sediment in the Minnesota River Basin	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												While sediment loads in streams draining agricultural landscapes have traditionally been attributed to field sources via overland flow and surface erosion, recent research has identified important nonfield sources of sediment in the Minnesota River Basin. We evaluate the impacts of altered vegetation on water budget and sediment loading in Seven Mile Creek, an agricultural watershed with important nonfield sources of sediment. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and monitoring data for different locations, we developed an approach to account for different sediment sources and show that nonfield sediment export is strongly affected by changes in stream discharge, which is affected by vegetation impacts on water yield. This is important because many watershed-scale models are calibrated to sediment loads at the watershed outlet based on the assumption that all sediment is derived from field sources. This can lead to overestimation of erosion from field sources and unrealistic expectations for watershed-scale reductions based on some conservation practices. In Seven Mile Creek watershed under current conditions, approximately 76% of the sediment delivered to the watershed outlet originates from nonfield sources (streambanks and ravines). Relative to the current landscape, increases in perennial grasses or switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cause decreases in water yield owing to differences in evapotranspiration (especially in the spring). As streamflow decreases, sediment export is disproportionately reduced from nonfield sources. These results demonstrating an interaction between evapotranspiration and streambank/ravine erosion are important for showing that nonfield sources of sediment can be important in some watersheds, and that realistic approaches for improving water quality may need to include strategies for managing water quantity.

However, the responses of LSWTs to climate warming in various climatic regions remain unclear due to the limited lake observations. Satellite-observed LSWT data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset were extended using the air2water model. This research aimed to investigate summer LSWT trends across various climatic zones in China, shedding light on the complex interplay between surface air temperatures and LSWT from 1950 to 2020. The results demonstrate robust model performance, with high Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients, affirming its capability to simulate LSWT variability. Regional disparities in LSWT patterns are identified, revealing notable warming trends in dryland lakes, particularly in central Inner Mongolia. Notably, the study unveils a substantial increase in the intensity and duration of lake heatwaves, especially in semi-arid regions. Dryland lake heatwaves emerge as dominant contributors to intensified LSWT warming, showcasing stronger and longer-lasting events than humid regions. The research highlights a positive feedback loop between lake warming and heatwaves, further amplifying dryland LSWT warming. These findings underscore the vulnerability of dryland lakes to climate change and signal the potential ramifications of increased greenhouse gas concentrations.					ji, fei/IUM-5818-2023; He, Yongli/G-4498-2018; Hu, Shujuan/AAX-9381-2020; Wu, Yuchen/GWU-7608-2022	He, Yongli/0000-0002-0183-378X; Hu, Shujuan/0000-0003-1756-434X; 														2072-4292				FEB	2024	16	3							588	10.3390/rs16030588	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16030588													WOS:001159038800001

We therefore decided to analyze the effects of disturbance on carabid communities in a wetland remnant (Lake Chiusi, central Italy). Results highlighted the presence of a disturbance gradient affecting the species richness and trait-displacement of carabid communities. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps from March to October 2008 at nine randomly selected sample stations; a set of landscape attributes were also collected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to link the distribution of carabid life-history traits and species richness with the most informative combination of landscape attributes. The first PCA axis (PC1) showed significant correlation with "distance to the lake shoreline" and "perimeter-area ratio", highlighting the presence of a disturbance-axis. The second and third axes accounted only for a trivial portion of the total variance. GLMMs revealed a progressive decrease in the number of hygrophilous species from the core of the wetland to its outer areas. Similar trends were observed for species richness and for predator species with good dispersal ability and larval period in summer. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account community-wide functional implications in landscape ecology studies.

The Neretva delta is divided with slopes of Biokovo (Rilici) and Gabelska greda on two different units: the Upper-Neretva delta or Svitaysko blato and lake Deransko (Hutovo blato) within borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Lower-Neretva delta within borders of Croatia, which is the subject of this work. Lower-Neretva delta can be divided according to a Conditional-Homogenous regionalization and criterium of natural elements into six micro-units: Vidovsko blato, Vrbovci - Kosevo, Kuti, Luke, Rogotin - Usce and Opuzen - Usce. According to criterium of socio-cultural and un-migrated areas it can be divided into four micro-units: Karst - limestone frame (mountain area), bordering area (contact between karst and swamp), alluvial plane (flow of the Neretva and the Mala Neretva) and seafront. According to nodal-functional regionalization and central settlements it can be divided into three units: the area of Metkovic, Opuzen and Ploce.																			0469-6255	1848-6320				JUN	2011	58	1-2					39	46																WOS:000450829700005

The mining areas included seven selected locations in the vicinity of active and abandoned iron ore-mining sites in Pahang, Malaysia. Heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Co, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Cd and metalloid As were present in the mining soils of the studied area, while Cu was found exceeding the soil guideline value at all sampling locations. However, the assessment of the potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated low ecological risk (RI between 44 and 128) with respect to Cd, Pb, Cu, As, Zn, Co, and Ni in the surface soils. Contributions of potential ecological risk by metal elements to the total potential ecological RI were evident for Cd, As, Pb, and Cu. Contribution of Cu appears to be consistently greater in the abandoned mining area compared to active iron ore-mining site. For non-carcinogenic risk, no significant potential health risk was found to both children and adults as the hazard indices (HIs) were all below than 1. The lifetime cancer risk (LCR) indicated that As has greater potential carcinogenic risk compared to other metals that may induce carcinogenic effects such as Pb, Cr, and Cd, while the LCR of As for children fell within tolerable range for regulatory purposes. Irrespective of carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic risk, greater potential health risk was found among children (by an order of magnitude higher for most metals) compared to adults. The hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk indicated that the pathways for the risk to occur were found to be in the order of ingestion > dermal > inhalation. Overall, findings showed that some metals and metalloid were still present at comparable concentrations even long after cessation of the iron ore-mining activities.

J	Finlayson, CM				Finlayson, CM			Plant ecology of Australia's tropical floodplain wetlands: A review	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Aims Despite the biodiversity values of the freshwater floodplains of northern Australia being widely recognized, there has not been a concomitant investment in developing the extent of knowledge of the basic functions and ecological processes that underpin the ecological character of these habitats. This review addresses the extent of our knowledge on the plant ecology of these wetlands and covers: the relationships between the climate and the hydrological regime on the floodplain; the vegetation patterns, succession and adaptation; and primary production. Scope Information is available on the seasonal, but less regularly on the inter-annual, dynamics of the macrophytic vegetation and its evident inter-relationship with the extent, depth and duration of inundation by seasonal flooding. The available scientifically collected information on plant distribution and relationship with the water regime could be complemented by more attention to traditional knowledge. The productivity of the vegetation is high-the dominant wetland grass species have an annual dry weight production of 0.5-2.1 kg m(-2) and the surrounding riparian (Melaleuca) trees contribute litterfall of 0.7-1.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) year(-1), similar to 70 % due to leaf-fall. The availability of dissolved oxygen in the water is known to vary diurnally and seasonally, at least in some habitats. The importance of seasonal differences in the availability of dissolved oxygen for the growth of micro- and macrophytic vegetation has not been investigated. The seasonal distribution and growth of plant species on a few floodplains have been investigated, and maps at scales of 1 : 10 000 to 1 : 100 000 are available for these. However, only on a few occasions have longer term analyses been conducted and long-term changes in the vegetation measured and assessed. Species lists and categorization of growth strategies and forms are available and provide a basis for further ecological investigation. Conclusions Despite the large investment in managing the many pressures that have degraded the ecological character of these highly valued wetlands, the fundamental ecological processes that underpin the biodiversity values have not received the same level of attention. Further information on plant growth and the environmental factors that drive seasonal and annual changes in vegetation distribution and productivity is required to assist managers in attending to changes due to increasing invasive species and changes in fire regimes.

Data were obtained to show an increase in the potential evaporation in all analyzed drainage basins by values from 0.39 to 0.62% per year since 1976 to 2020. A moderate or statistically insignificant decrease is typical of precipitation (0.25 to 0.59% per year) and water discharges, mostly due to a decrease in the summer runoff at a rate of 5.6%/10 years. The possible role of changes in vegetation cover in these processes was studied by evaluating NDVI parameter in 2019 compared with 2002 by data of space surveys MOD13A3 and MYD13A3 with MODIS spectroradiometer of Terra and Aqua satellites. A conclusion was made about the key role of precipitation in the decrease in the maximal runoff in Lake Baikal basin.

Over the past 20 years, the region has experienced extensive and rapid land cover changes that may have exceeded the adaptability of geese, and have led to suitable goose habitat area loss, thereby, reducing the stability of the geese population. In order to identify the suitable goose habitat areas in this region, based on ensemble modeling and satellite tracking data, in this study, we simulated the spatial distribution changes in the suitable goose habitat areas over the past 20 years. The results showed that the suitable goose habitat areas had suffered varying degrees of loss, among which, the lesser white-fronted goose had the greatest suitable goose habitat area loss of over 50%. Moreover, we found that wetlands, lakes, and floodplains were the key components of suitable goose habitat areas, and the categories (land use) showed significant differences in different periods (p < 0.01). This may be one of the main reasons for the decrease in suitable goose habitat areas. The results of this study provide an important reference for the adaptive management and protection of geese in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.					; ZENG, Qing/V-9563-2019; wu, entao/GRJ-7455-2022; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021	Jia, Yifei/0000-0002-9056-9924; Wu, Entao/0000-0003-1275-8022; 														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1883	10.3390/rs14081883	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081883													WOS:000787398200001

Microbes have been found to survive at even lower temperatures, and with a few exceptions, antifreeze proteins are missing. We show that lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a biopolymer in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, can be added to B. subtilis cultures and increase freeze tolerance. At 1 % w/v, LTA enables a 50 % survival rate, similar to the results obtained with 1 % w/v glycerol as measured with the resazurin cell viability assay. In the absence of added LTA or glycerol, a very small number of B. subtilis cells survive freezing. This suggests that an innate freeze tolerance mechanism exists. While cryoprotection can be provided by extracellular polymeric substances, our data demonstrate a role for LTA in cryoprotection. Currently, the exact mode of action for LTA cryoprotection is unknown. With a molecular weight of 3-5 kDa, it is unlikely to enter the cell cytoplasm. However, low temperature microscopy data show small ice crystals aligned along channels of liquid water. Our observations suggest that teichoic acids could protect liquid water within biofilms and planktonic bacteria, augmenting the role of brine while also raising the possibility for survival without brine present.																			1431-0651	1433-4909				MAR	2015	19	2					297	305		10.1007/s00792-014-0714-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-014-0714-1								25477208					WOS:000350306200007

Range expansion and prey use of American mink in Argentinean Patagonia: dilemmas for conservation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Following the establishment of American mink farms outside North America, the species has successfully invaded Europe and South America, and in some places, their presence demonstrably threatens native biodiversity. We surveyed for mink signs along the Andean Patagonian forest in Argentina from 38A degrees 52' S to 54A degrees 52' S, revealing that their range has now expanded to span 800 km of contiguous occupation on the continent including several types of wetlands and has also colonised Tierra del Fuego Island. Rate of expansion was estimated using two methodologies and varied between 5.53 and 9.00 km/year (linear method, large-scale spread) and 4.86 km/year (within a more restricted area, grid method). Diet throughout the region fitted the generalist pattern described for mink elsewhere. Native small mammals were the most frequently consumed category. Crustaceans (patchily distributed in the region) occurred in the diet in proportion to their availability (r (s)=0.961, p < 0.001), but that of waterfowl did not (r (s)=0.178, p=0.713). Diet was evaluated at one lake throughout a year, revealing that consumption of crustaceans fell in the cold months when bird abundance increased. Based on published work on the impact of American mink as an introduced species in Patagonia and elsewhere, together with our own survey, we discuss the implications of this invasion for biodiversity conservation in Argentinean Patagonia and the associated dilemmas for management policy.																			1612-4642	1439-0574				APR	2011	57	2					283	294		10.1007/s10344-010-0425-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0425-6													WOS:000288553600011

This pollution can occur by either naturally, such as algal blooms, or man-made when toxic substances are released into water bodies like lakes, rivers, springs, and oceans. To address this issue and monitor surface-level water pollution in local water bodies, an informative real-time vision-based surveillance system has been developed in conjunction with large language models (LLMs). This system has an integrated camera connected to a Raspberry Pi for processing input frames and is further linked to LLMs for generating contextual information regarding the type, causes, and impact of pollutants on both human health and the environment. This multi-model setup enables local authorities to monitor water pollution and take necessary steps to mitigate it. To train the vision model, seven major types of pollutants found in water bodies like algal bloom, synthetic foams, dead fishes, oil spills, wooden logs, industrial waste run-offs, and trashes were used for achieving accurate detection. ChatGPT API has been integrated with the model to generate contextual information about pollution detected. Thus, the multi-model system can conduct surveillance over water bodies and autonomously alert local authorities to take immediate action, eliminating the need for human intervention.Practitioner Points Combines cameras and LLMs with Raspberry Pi for processing and generating pollutant information. Uses YOLOv5 to detect algal blooms, synthetic foams, dead fish, oil spills, and industrial waste. Supports various modules and environments, including drones and mobile apps for broad monitoring.

An increase in the frequency of storm-induced short-term N pulses and increased water temperatures are both likely outcomes of climate change, potentially affecting the N processing in lakes. An experiment with a (KNO3-)-N-15 pulse addition (increase in NO3- concentration from c.0.1 to 2mg/L) was carried out in 12 mesocosms with relatively low (applies to Danish lakes) total N (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (c.0.3mgNL(-1) and 0.04mgPL(-1)) to assess the effects of an N pulse on N processing and storage in shallow lake ecosystems. The mesocosms have a hydraulic retention time of approximately two and a half months, and at the time of the experiment, they had been adapted to contrasting temperatures for a period of 10years: ambient, T3 (heating according to the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change 2007 A2 scenario, +3.7-4.5 degrees C, depending on season) and T5 (heating with A2+50%, +4.9-6.6 degrees C). Macrophytes and filamentous algae retained up to 40% and 30% of the added N-15, respectively, reflecting their high biomass in the mesocosms. Macrophytes and filamentous algae constituted between 70% and 80% of the biomass of all primary producers during the experiment in the T3 and ambient treatments and between 20% and 40% in T5. By comparison, less than 1% of the added N-15 diffused to the sediment and less than 5% was lost to the atmosphere as N-2 gas. Snails represented the long-term storage of N-15, retaining up to 6% of the tracer and with detectable enrichment 100days after tracer addition. We found no significant differences among the temperature treatments in the N-15 turnover after pulse dosing. However, a larger percentage of N-15 was stored in macrophytes in the ambient and T3 mesocosms, reflecting higher biomasses than in T5 where filamentous algae were more abundant. Macrophytes and filamentous algae rather than temperature were therefore key controllers of N processing during the summer N pulse in these shallow, relatively low TP lakes.

J	Zhong, AW; Cao, T; Ni, LY; Xie, P				Zhong, Aiwen; Cao, Te; Ni, Leyi; Xie, Ping			Growth and membrane permeability of two submersed macrophytes in response to ammonium enrichment	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Increased ammonium (NH4+) concentrations are reported to be an important cause of decline in submersed macrophytes in eutrophic lakes. In this study, a subacute experiment was conducted to examine the effects of various NH4+ concentrations on growth and membrane permeability of 2 submersed macrophytes, Myriophyllum spicatum and Ceratophyllum demersum. Apical shoots of the plants were incubated in modified Hoagland solution with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 mg l(-1) NH4+-N for 4 d. The plants were then collected for examination of cell membrane permeability and the solutions were used to determine the concentrations of NH4+, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+). The results indicate that high NH4+ concentrations had significant adverse effects (e.g. reduced growth and leaf chlorosis) on the macrophytes and increased membrane permeability, leading to net leakage of NH4+ and the cations. Compared to M. spicatum, C. demersum had higher membrane permeability, which might enhance NH4+ transportation across the membrane and thus increase its tolerance to NH4+ stress. Significant increases in the membrane permeability of M. spicatum and C. demersum were observed in the treatments with external NH4+-N concentrations of >= 2 mg l(-1), which fall within the range of NH4+ concentrations in many eutrophic lakes.

The known geographic range includes the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and recently it has invaded the Great Lakes region of North America. The goal of this work was to characterize genetic diversity of Great Lakes VHSV isolates at the early stage of this viral emergence by comparing a partial glycoprotein (G) gene sequence (669 nt) of 108 isolates collected from 2003 to 2009 from 31 species and at 37 sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all isolates fell into sub-lineage IVb within the major VHSV genetic group IV. Among these 108 isolates, genetic diversity was low, with a maximum of 1.05% within the 669 nt region. There were 11 unique sequences, designated vcG001 to vcG011. Two dominant sequence types, vcG001 and vcG002, accounted for 90% (97 of 108) of the isolates. The vcG001 isolates were most widespread. We saw no apparent association of sequence type with host or year of isolation, but we did note a spatial pattern, in which vcG002 isolates were more prevalent in the easternmost sub-regions, including inland New York state and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Different sequence types were found among isolates from single disease outbreaks, and mixtures of types were evident within 2 isolates from individual fish. Overall, the genetic diversity of VHSV in the Great Lakes region was found to be extremely low, consistent with an introduction of a new virus into a geographic region with previously naive host populations.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022														0177-5103	1616-1580				AUG 29	2011	96	1					29	43		10.3354/dao02362	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao02362								21991663					WOS:000294435100004
J	Mai, DH				Mai, Dieter Hans			Carpological investigation of interglacial sediments from Neumark-Nord (Geiseltal)	PALAEONTOGRAPHICA ABTEILUNG B-PALAOPHYTOLOGIE												The interglacial of Neumark-Nord near Merseburg, in the Geisel valley, basin NN1, contains one of the richest and most remarkable fruit and seed floras of the middle Pleistocene with more than 190 species. Today the locality is surrounded by the Middle German and region and shows therefore some special botanical features. The fossil plants derived from washing hands of detritus ashore of an interglacial lake with periodically changing water level. A high interglacial sequence with a clear changing of the forest Succession is discernible in some profiles over the Saalian-1 till, palynologically investigated by M. SEIFERT and T LITT. The first stage of the warming phase in the development of the forest vegetation is the thermophilous oak-steppe forest with Quercus pubescens and Acer tataricum. It follows the Carpinus forest. No other interglacial is more remarkably influenced by the Middle German and region. The most important sociological key species is Acer tataricum, which nowadays is distributed in the eastern submeridional Europe (Pontian floristic region), grown here in the open forests of the Aceri tatarico-Quercetum pubescentis. The species indicates a subcontinental to submediterranean climate with warm summers. The northern borderline of the species distribution area coincides with the 18.5 to 19 degrees C-isotherme of the summer (July). Many species are submediterranean or subcontinental, Southeastern European-western Asian steppe-plants: Allium flavum, Carthamus lanatus, Chenopodium glaucum, corispermum orientale, Lavandula angustifolia, Filipendula vulgaris, Linum cf. austriacum, Linum flavum, Medicago minima, Onobrychis cf. arenaria, Onopordon acanthium, Polycnemum arvense, Portulaca oleracea, Seseli hippomarathrum, Thymelaea passerina, Verbena officinalis, Viola cf. alba, Viola rupestris. Contemporaneously, there is the proof of many halophytes, headed by the very frequent Ruppia maritima, always associated by Potamogeton pectinatus and Zannichellia palustris, which clearly indicate an open inland salt flat. The species of brackish water reeds and salt meadows followed with Bolboschoenus maritimus, Carex secalina, Ranunculus ardous, Rumex maritimus, Schoenoplectus melanospermus, and Triglochin maritimum. In the ecosystem of Neumark-Nord the interactions of flora and fauna are verifiable by the nitrophytic, ruderal herbaceous perennial associations (Prae-Onopordetalia acanthii), the semi-dry lawns and the nitrophilous shoreline herbaceous perennial associations. It was possibly initially restricted to the layers of animals or the muddy pools of games. The "Brasenia-complex" of the water-and swamp plants is a good thermophilic indicator, the association of Cypero fusci-Limoselletum aquaticae is a remarkable indicator of periodical dryness of the lake or the lakeshore. The interglacial taphocoenosis of Neumark-Nord is so unique in Central Europe that even no comparisons are possible with well known and dated interglacials of the region between Saale and Elbe. Around the Middle German arid area in the tendency of subcontinentality only the Grabschutz interglacial near Delitzsch/Saxony with a flora of steppe and many halophytes at the climatic optimum is similar. But this interglacial is controversial in the geological classification.																			0375-0299					MAR	2010	282	4-6					99	187		10.1127/palb/282/2010/99	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/palb/282/2010/99													WOS:000275916000001

Is Culex modestus (Diptera: Culicidae), Vector of West Nile Virus, Spreading in the Dombes Area, France?	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												As a main vector of West Nile (WN) virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in Europe, Culex modestus Ficalbi (Diptera: Culicidae) is commonly found in delta regions, lakes, and ponds. The Dombes area is located along one of the main corridors of bird migrations in France and lies 300 kin north of the Camargue region,a frequent focus of WN Virus Circulation. It is an important breeding, wintering, and stopover site for many bird species that are putative carriers of viruses of different kinds. It is also a continental wetland with approximate to 1,200 fish farming ponds, scattered over the area, that provide Suitable breeding sites for Cx. modestus. This article reports in entomological Study based oil larval Surveys conducted in ponds in 2007 to assess the prevalence and abundance of Cx. modestus in the Dombes. Using the larval survey as an ecological screening test, we investigated the proportion of ponds found positive for Cx. modestus, and the relative abundance of thus species was estimated in larval samples. We found that its pond distribution was more extensive in the 2007 survey than in that conducted in the 1970s. Survey methods and meteorological and anthropological factors that could account for the differences or variations between the findings of the two investigations are discussed.

J	Mönkkönen, M; Helle, P; Niemi, GJ; Montgomery, K				Mönkkönen, M; Helle, P; Niemi, GJ; Montgomery, K			Heterospecific attraction affects community structure and migrant abundances in northern breeding bird communities	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We experimentally tested the heterospecific attraction hypothesis by manipulating densities of resident birds (black-capped chickadee, Parus atricapillus, red-breasted nuthatch, Sitta canadensis, and white-breasted nuthatch, S. carolinensis) on 7 lake islands in northern Minnesota, U.S.A. Resident numbers were increased by winter feeding and decreased by removals using mist nets. The heterospecific attraction hypothesis states that migrants use residents as a cue to identify the best sites for breeding in a heterogeneous landscape because residents have already selected higher quality sites. The hypothesis predicts that there will be a higher overall density of migrants associated with increased resident density. Results showed that there was a consistent change in migrant bird community structure (i.e., in the relative abundance of species) in response to manipulation. This change resulted mainly from an increased density of arboreal insectivores, i.e., species that belong to the same foraging guild as residents, suggesting that food is an important factor contributing to heterospecific attraction. The red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus, and black-and-white warbler, Mniotilta varia, showed the strongest positive response. No migrant species responded negatively to augmented resident density, suggesting that interspecific competition may be less important in structuring breeding bird communities in northern forests. Our results support the view that positive interactions should be considered when studying community structure.					; Mönkkönen, Mikko/A-2821-2011	Monkkonen, Mikko/0000-0001-8897-3314; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				DEC	1997	75	12					2077	2083		10.1139/z97-842	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z97-842													WOS:000071903500017

The Influence of Tree Infilling on Energy Partitioning, Vegetation Water Use, and Soil Water State in Sparse Conifer Stands of the Taiga Shield Ecoregion	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Climate warming and permafrost thaw induced land cover change are well documented in much of the circumpolar north. The extensive exposure of Precambrian continental crust in Canada's Taiga Shield ecoregion could mean impacts of land cover change documented in other regions without this feature are not transferable. This study examined energy partitioning with eddy covariance measurements, vegetation water use with stable isotopes and soil water state with time domain reflectometry sensors in conifer stands in the Taiga Shield ecoregion. The goal was to determine how changes in forest density with climate warming could influence water budget response and soil water state. Paired measurements of sensible and latent heat imply evaporative processes in denser canopies are controlled more by radiative than the aerodynamic factors predominant in sparser canopies. As denser canopies become more prevalent on the landscape, this switch in relative importance of evapotranspirative processes will lead to a reduction in inter-annual variability of evapotranspiration. The dominant tree species (black spruce, tamarack and jack pine) were all quick to draw water from shallow soils after spring thaw and rainfall. Stand structural changes resulted in older, more evaporatively enriched water prevalent in soils below dense canopies. While there is evidence for forest infilling, widespread lakes and exposed bedrock restricts extensive expansion of forested land covers. The insufficient difference between sparse and dense canopy evapotranspiration suggest a fundamental change in how water cycles in Taiga Shield catchments is unlikely, which is notably different than previously investigated landscapes in Alaska and the Canadian Taiga Plains. Evapotranspiration becomes less sensitive to precipitation variability as canopy density increases in Taiga Shield forests Taiga vegetation tends to draw younger less evaporatively enriched soil water, and denser forests tend to have older more evaporatively enriched water in soils by the end of the growing season Increased forest cover is not expected to change catchment water cycles because open water and exposed bedrock restrict tree expansion					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009	Baltzer, Jennifer/0000-0001-7476-5928; Nicholls, Erin/0000-0002-8102-7285; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; Perron, Nia/0000-0002-0687-3262													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2024	60	8							e2024WR037454	10.1029/2024WR037454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037454													WOS:001296567000001

The specific respiration rate of 13 chironomid taxa and Chaoborus were measured to test the hypothesis of the relation between a species' ability to regulate their oxygen uptake and their distributional patterns among nine study lakes in British Columbia, Canada. 2. Respiration patterns of individual taxa were modelled using piecewise linear regression with break point and simple hyperbolic functions. Three types of respiration curves were identified: (i) classical oxy-conformers (e.g. littoral Cricotopus) which cannot sustain a sufficient oxygen uptake with decreasing oxygen availability; (ii) oxy-regulators (e.g. profundal Chironomus) which can regulate and maintain a constant respiration until a certain critical point and (iii) oxy-stressors (Micropsectra) which increase their respiration rate with decreasing oxygen availability until a critical point. 3. Respiration was measured at two different temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C), and over the range of oxygen saturation conditions studied here (0-90%) mean Q(10) values varied from 1.3 to 2.5. 4. The results show that different chironomid taxa have varying sensitivity to low oxygen concentrations and different respiratory responses to increased temperature. The critical point increased to higher oxygen saturation for six taxa, decreased for one taxon and was unchanged for two taxa. 5. The results illustrate one of the possible biological mechanisms behind the use of chironomids as temperature and climate indicators in palaeoecological studies by exploring the link between temperature and respiration physiology.

J	Wine, ML				Wine, Michael L.			Under non-stationarity securitization contributes to uncertainty and Tragedy of the Commons	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Uncertainty is a defining characteristic of hydrologic investigations, with increasing recognition of parameter, structural, measurement, and prediction uncertainty. Here we suggest that an additional form of uncertainty-(geo)political uncertainty-is locally important, but commonly neglected. We define geopolitical uncertainty in hydrology as indefiniteness of water balance processes, the relative magnitude of hydrologic fluxes, or causality as a consequence of complex international relations amongst riparians of a transboundary basin forced by internal economic, political, and nationalistic drivers (as well as interactions amongst these drivers) under a regime of non-stationary climate. We suggest that such (geo)political uncertainty has developed in the Jordan River basin as a consequence of intentionally ambiguous language in the Israel Jordan Peace Treaty, outstanding discussions regarding water allocations to the Palestinian Authority, and lobbying by the powerful agricultural sector. In the presence of economic motives requiring consumption of water these drivers promote securitization manifested as secrecy regarding water management and consumption by the upstream riparian, which given non-stationary climate opens a void of (geo)political uncertainty in which the relative importance of climate variability and change becomes indeterminate relative to changing water consumption, thereby perhaps allowing the upstream riparian to increase water consumption. The consequence of this (geo) political uncertainty for hydrologic studies is large water balance uncertainty, inability to reproduce water consumption studies due to data secrecy, and disagreement regarding the relative importance of pertinent drivers (i.e., climate versus consumption). Greater acknowledgement and awareness of (geo)political uncertainty's impacts on hydrologic studies is needed, as are concerted efforts to reduce this uncertainty for the benefit of transparent water dialogue among riparians and knowledge-based management of common-pool resources.

In this study, the depositional record of Froude near-critical and supercritical flows in glacigenic settings is reviewed, and similarities and differences between different depositional environments are discussed. Upper-flow-regime bedforms may occur in subglacial, subaerial and subaqueous environments, recording deposition by free-surface flows and submerged density flows. Although individual bedform types are generally not indicative of any specific depositional environment, some observed trends are similar to those documented in non-glacigenic settings. Important parameters for bedform evolution that differ between depositional environments include flow confinement, bed slope, aggradation rate and grain size. Cyclic-step deposits are more common in confined settings, like channels or incised valleys, or steep slopes of coarse-grained deltas. Antidune deposits prevail in unconfined settings and on more gentle slopes, like glacifluvial fans, sand-rich delta slopes or subaqueous (ice-contact) fans. At low aggradation rates, only the basal portions of bedforms are preserved, such as scour fills related to the hydraulic-jump zone of cyclic steps or antidune-wave breaking, which are common in glacifluvial systems and during glacial lake-outburst floods and (related) lake-level falls. Higher aggradation rates result in increased preservation potential, possibly leading to the preservation of complete bedforms. Such conditions are met in sediment-laden jokulhlaups and subaqueous proglacial environments characterized by expanding density flows. Coarser-grained sediment leads to steeper bedform profiles and highly scoured facies architectures, while finer-grained deposits display less steep bedform architectures. Such differences are in part related to stronger flows, faster settling of coarse clasts, and more rapid breaking of antidune waves or hydraulic-jump formation over hydraulically rough beds.

Spawning success and early life history of longnose suckers in Great Lakes tributaries	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Fish eggs and larvae are often subject to very high mortality, and variation in early life survival can be important for population dynamics. Although longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) are widespread in northern North America, little is known about their early life history. We examined fecundity and early larval survivorship during sucker spawning events in three small Lake Michigan tributaries. Although egg deposition varied 25% among spawning events, estimated larval export to the lake varied over 25,000-fold from around 1000 to 26 million. Based on variation in environmental conditions across years, it appears that spring flow and temperature may be important determinants of egg survival to larval outmigration. Larval age data suggest that most individuals that survived to outmigration hatched during a 2-day period despite adult spawning across at least 10days. Most larvae spent <2weeks in the stream and emigrated around the time of transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding before substantial growth occurred. In two of three cases, larvae drifted exclusively at night; however, high drift rates occurred during both day and night in the case where larvae were very abundant, suggesting density-dependent drift behaviour. Our results indicate that survival in tributary streams from egg deposition to larval export is highly variable in longnose suckers. These large differences in early life survival may translate into variability in recruitment, thereby influencing population structure and dynamics.

J	Che, P; Lan, JH				Che, Ping; Lan, Jianghu			Climate Change along the Silk Road and Its Influence on Scythian Cultural Expansion and Rise of the Mongol Empire	SUSTAINABILITY												Climate change and cultural exchange both influenced cultural development along the continental Silk Road during the late Holocene, but climate change and its influence on nomadic civilizations during that time has yet to be systematically assessed. In this study, we analyzed records of climate change along the Silk Road covering key periods in the late Holocene, based on multiproxies from various archives including lake sediments, shorelines/beach ridges, peatlands, ice cores, tree rings, aeolian sediments, moraines, and historical documents. Combined with archaeological data, we assessed the influence of climate on development and expansion of representative pastoral nomadism. Our results show that the most notable climate changes in Central Asia were characterized by decreasing temperature, expanding glaciers, increasing precipitation, and increasing humidity during transitions from the Sub-Boreal to Sub-Atlantic Period (ca. 9-8th century BC) and from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age (ca. 13-14th century AD). The two periods coincided with Scythian Cultural expansion across the steppe landscape of Central Asia and rise of the Mongol Empire, respectively. These temporal coincidences are interpreted as causally related, where temperature fall and glacial advance may have forced the pastoral nomadism to southward migration. Coeval wetness and southward migration of steppe landscape in Central Asia were beneficial for these cultural expansions, which spanned the Eurasian arid and semi-arid zone westward. Therefore, during the historical period when productivity was underdeveloped, although expansions of pastoral nomadism were closely related to internal social structures, climate change was possibly the most critical controlling factor for sustainability development and collapse.					; Lan, Jianghu/AAJ-2140-2021	Lan, Jianghu/0000-0002-5618-2363; 														2071-1050				MAR	2021	13	5							2530	10.3390/su13052530	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13052530													WOS:000628635200001
J	Gardner, M; Sitar, N				Gardner, Michael; Sitar, Nicholas			Modeling of Dynamic Rock-Fluid Interaction Using Coupled 3-D Discrete Element and Lattice Boltzmann Methods	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING												Scour of rock is a challenging and interesting problem that combines rock mechanics and hydraulics of turbulent flow. On a practical level, rock erosion is a critical issue facing many of the world's dams at which excessive scour of the dam foundation or spillway can compromise the stability of the dam resulting in significant remediation costs, if not direct personal property damage or even loss of life. This interaction between the blocky rock mass and water is analyzed by directly modeling the solid and fluid phases-the individual polyhedral blocks are modeled using the discrete element method (DEM) while water is modeled using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM mesh is entirely independent of the DEM discretization, making it possible to refine the LBM mesh such that transient and varied fluid pressures acting on the rock surfaces are directly modeled. This provides the capability to investigate the effect of water pressure inside the fractured rock mass, along potential sliding planes, and can be extended to rock falls and slides into standing bodies of water such as lakes and reservoirs. Results show that the coupled DEM-LBM implementation is able to accurately capture the interaction between polyhedral rock blocks and fluid by analytically solving for the solid volume fraction in the coupling computations using convex optimization and simplex integration; however, further performance improvements are necessary to simulate realistic, field-scale problems. Particularly, adaptive mesh refinement and multigrid methods implemented in a parallel computing environment will be essential for capturing the highly computationally intensive and multiscale nature of rock-fluid interaction.

Although Hg in most freshwater fish from northern Canada was not sufficiently elevated to be of concern, a few lakes in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut contained fish of certain species (e.g. northern pike, Arctic char) whose muscle Hg concentrations exceeded an estimated threshold range (0.5-1.0 mu g g(-1) wet weight) within which adverse biological effects begin to occur. Marine fish species generally had substantially lower Hg concentrations than freshwater fish; but the Greenland shark, a long-lived predatory species, had mean muscle Hg concentrations exceeding the threshold range for possible effects on health or reproduction. An examination of recent egg Hg concentrations for marine birds from the Canadian Arctic indicated that mean Hg concentration in ivory gulls from Seymour Island fell within the threshold range associated with adverse effects on reproduction in birds. Mercury concentrations in brain tissue of beluga whales and polar bears were generally lower than levels associated with neurotoxicity in mammals, but were sometimes high enough to cause subtle neurochemical changes that can precede overt neurotoxicity. Harbour seals from western Hudson Bay had elevated mean liver Hg concentrations along with comparatively high muscle Hg concentrations indicating potential health effects from methylmercury (MeHg) exposure on this subpopulation. Because current information is generally insufficient to determine with confidence whether Hg exposure is impacting the health of specific fish or wildlife populations in the Canadian Arctic, biological effects studies should comprise a major focus of future Hg research in the Canadian Arctic. Additionally, studies on cellular interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) are required to better account for potential protective effects of Se on Hg toxicity, especially in large predatory Arctic fish, birds, and mammals.

J	Peng, XJ; Min, MZ; Qiao, HM; Wang, JP; Fayek, M				Peng, Xinjian; Min, Maozhong; Qiao, Haiming; Wang, Jinping; Fayek, Mostafa			Uranium-Series Disequilibria in the Groundwater of the Shihongtan Sandstone-Hosted Uranium Deposit, NW China	MINERALS												Uranium (U) concentration and the activities of U-238, U-234, and Th-230 were determined for groundwaters, spring waters, and lake water collected from the Shihongtan sandstone-hosted U ore district and in the surrounding area, NW China. The results show that the groundwaters from the oxidizing aquifer with high dissolved oxygen concentration (O-2) and oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) are enriched in U. The high U concentration of groundwaters may be due to the interaction between these oxidizing groundwaters and U ore bodies, which would result in U that is not in secular equilibrium. Uranium is re-precipitated as uraninite on weathered surfaces and organic material, forming localized ore bodies in the sandstone-hosted aquifer. The U-234/U-238, Th-230/U-234, and Th-230/U-238 activity ratios (ARs) for most water samples show obvious deviations from secular equilibrium (0.27-2.86), indicating the presence of water-rock/ore interactions during the last 1.7 Ma and probably longer. The U-234/U-238 AR generally increases with decreasing Uconcentrations in the groundwaters, suggesting that mixing of two water sources may occur in the aquifer. This is consistent with the fact that most of the U ore bodies in the deposit have a tabular shape originati from mixing between a relatively saline fluid and a more rapidly flowing U-bearing meteoric water.

J	Yang, H; Zheng, FF; Xiao, WJ; Xie, SC				Yang Huan; Zheng FengFeng; Xiao WenJie; Xie ShuCheng			Distinct distribution revealing multiple bacterial sources for 1-O-monoalkyl glycerol ethers in terrestrial and lake environments	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The 1-O-monoalkyl glycerol ethers (MAGEs) were initially viewed as the biomarkers for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediating anaerobic oxidation of methane in the marine environments. However, limited information is known about their distribution in terrestrial and other aquatic settings including soils, fresh water lakes, and cave sediments, which may obscure our understanding of their biological sources. Here we found that MAGEs were ubiquitous but differed obviously in distributional pattern among those environments. The surface soils are dominated generally by iC(15:0)-MAGE, followed by nC(16:0)-MAGE whereas the lake sediments show the opposite, resulting in significantly higher iC(15:0)/nC(16:0) ratios in soils than in lake sediments. The cave deposits are characterized by considerably higher proportions of branched MAGEs than the former two environments. The logarithm of iC(15:0)/aC(15:0) ratio shows a significant negative correlation with soil pH, likely reflecting an adaptation of microbial cell membrane to change in the ambient proton concentration. The MAGE profiles in cultured bacteria cannot fully explain the MAGE distribution in all the samples analyzed. Therefore, MAGEs in soil, lake sediments, and cave deposits likely have additional biological source(s) other than SRB and cultured MAGE-producing bacteria. The difference in MAGE pattern among environments is likely to be attributed to change in microbial communities.					; Zheng, Fengfeng/K-6031-2018; Xie, Shucheng/E-6713-2011; Xiao, Wenjie/AAK-5893-2020; Yang, Huan/AAF-9358-2021	, Shucheng XIE/0000-0002-5763-2928; Xiao, Wenjie/0000-0002-4734-683X; Zheng, Fengfeng/0000-0002-8507-162X; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				JUN	2015	58	6					1005	1017		10.1007/s11430-014-5016-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-014-5016-z													WOS:000354901900015

Base treatment resulted in a very high immediate dissolution efficiency in both lakes (78-82%), increasing acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) to values of 450-550 .mu.eq.cntdot.L-1. During the fall following manipulation, completely mixed water columns and elevated hydrologic inputs greatly facilitated reacidification, decreasing pH and diluting Ca2+ concentrations. Cranberry Pond effectively reacidified within 7 mo of treatment, while the ANC of Woods Lake decreased to near 0 .mu.eq.cntdot.L-1 15 mo after application. In Cranberry Pond, pH values decreased below 5.5 resulting in transport of elevated concentrations of inorganic Al through the lake. Annual ANC budgets suggest that little CaCO3 penetrated to the sediments, limiting long-term release of ANC from sediment dissolution. Hydrolysis of Al, due to the elevated lake pH, served to consume ANC and there is evidence to indicate limited exchange of water column Ca2+ with sediments shortly after treatment followed by release of this Ca2+ during reacidification. However these processes did not significantly accelerate or attenuate the rate of reacidification. The rate of acidification could largely be explained by the flushing of ANC from the lakes by hydrologic inputs.

BAP was analyzed in a bioassay in which natural P-limited bacterioplankton grew with natural P as the sole P source. In both streams, approximately 90% of the BAP occurred as dissolved species (passing a 0.2-mu m filter), consisting partly of low-molecular-weight forms (passing a filter with nominal cutoff at 1 kDa) and partly of high-molecular-weight forms (passing a 0.2-mu m filter but not a 1-kDa filter). Concentrations of total dissolved BAP varied between 1 mu g L-1 and 14 mu g L-1, with the highest values in the middle of the summer. Compared to the forest stream, BAP concentrations were generally higher in the mire stream, where it occasionally amounted to nearly 50% of total P. Molybdate reactive phosphorus overestimated BAP considerably. Most of the BAP was in forms other than free orthophosphate. Temporal BAP variations showed no relationships with dissolved organic carbon (C) or iron but were positively related to air temperature and negatively related to the absorbance ratio (a254 : a365) of organic compounds in the water, indicating connections between terrestrial export of BAP and temperature-dependent terrestrial C metabolism. Concentrations of BAP can relieve stream bacteria from P limitation, and a significant share of BAP exported to streams can reach and be used in downstream lakes.

By straightening up the, extensive excursion records, 23 geomagnetic excursions were identified in total for the Brunhes. Eighteen out of 23 excursions are considered to be reliably determined and dated. Above all, Mono Lake (32-34 ka), Laschamp (39-41 ka), Blake (115-122 ka) and Iceland Basin (180-190 ka) are well-documented worldwide excursions. Others include Hilina Pali(18-23 ka), Norwegian-Greenland Sea (60-80 ka), Albuquerque (140-160 ka), Jamaica/Pringle Falls (210-220 ka), Fram Strait (255-265 ka), Kolbeinsey Ridge (280-290 ka), Calabrian Ridge 1 (310-320 ka), Agulhas Ridge (330-340 ka), Weinen (400-420 ka), West Eifel (500-510 ka), Calabrian Ridge 2 (535-545 ka), Emperor/Big Lost (550-570 ka), Calabrian Ridge 3 (580-605 ka), and Delta (665-690 ka). Most of these excursions can be correlated with minima in relative paleointensity records of Sint-800 and ODP Site 983, suggesting that excursions occur due to dominance of a non-dipole field at minima of the main dipole field intensity.					; Oda, Hirokuni/L-8005-2018	Oda, Hirokuni/0000-0001-7142-9208; 													0022-135X	1884-0884					2005	114	2			SI		174	193																WOS:000446244000007
J	Rostad, CE				Rostad, CE			Concentration and transport of chlordane and nonachlor associated with suspended sediment in the Mississippi River, May 1988 to June 1990	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Technical chlordane, a formerly widely used organochlorine pesticide, has become widespread in the environment. The distribution of technical chlordane in riverine environments may be due in part to resuspension and aqueous transport of contaminated bed sediment. To test this hypothesis, the Mississippi River was sampled for suspended sediment five times over a two-year period, at up to 17 sites from St. Louis to below New Orleans, including major tributaries. The ratio of chlordane to nonachlor concentrations averaged 3.6 during May-June 1988 for the Mississippi River below its confluence with the Ohio River. During March-April 1989, the ratio was 0.6, suggesting weathered technical chlordane contributions to the suspended sediment. During June 1989, the ratio averaged 1.1, indicating some input of less weathered technical chlordane. During February-March and May-June 1990, the ratios again shifted, from 0.8 to 1.3. This shifting ratio is likely due to resuspension of weathered technical chlordane associated with bed sediment during spring runoff Annual transport by suspended sediment from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to be 110 kg of chlordane and 100 kg of nonachlor.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				NOV	1997	33	4					369	377		10.1007/s002449900266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900266								9419255					WOS:000071159400004

Both approaches can lead to significant uncertainties, as tree-rings may underestimate the amplitude of past temperature variations, and the validity of non-annual records cannot be clearly assessed. In this study, we assembled 45 published Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature proxy records covering the past millennium, each of which satisfied 3 essential criteria: the series must be of annual resolution, span at least a thousand years, and represent an explicit temperature signal. Suitable climate archives included ice cores, varved lake sediments, tree-rings and speleothems. We reconstructed the average annual land temperature series for the NH over the last millennium by applying 3 different reconstruction techniques: (1) principal components (PC) plus second-order autoregressive model (AR2), (2) composite plus scale (CPS) and (3) regularized errors-in-variables approach (EIV). Our reconstruction is in excellent agreement with 6 climate model simulations (including the first 5 models derived from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and an earth system model of intermediate complexity (LOVECLIM), showing similar temperatures at multi-decadal timescales; however, all simulations appear to underestimate the temperature during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). A comparison with other NH reconstructions shows that our results are consistent with earlier studies. These results indicate that well-validated annual proxy series should be used to minimize proxy-based artifacts, and that these proxy series contain sufficient information to reconstruct the low-frequency climate variability over the past millennium.

To strengthen inferences, multiple populations may be examined simultaneously to confirm whether relationships can be generalized across multiple systems; however, this assumes that populations respond similarly to climate drivers, ignoring the potential for ecological complexity. Using data on eight sockeye salmon populations from southwestern Alaska, we constructed a series of models based on ecological hypotheses, relating salmon population productivity to climate factors experienced at different life stages. We modeled populations at a range of organizational scales, from distinct populations, to populations grouped by common nursery lake, to all populations within a watershed, and determined the relative statistical support for climate drivers at each scale. In general, warmer lake and sea surface temperatures in the summer coincided with increased productivity of these populations, but the most sensitive life-stage for climate effects varied among populations, particularly among nursery lakes. The best model when considering all populations together, despite strong statistical support, failed to represent the complexity which became evident when populations were modeled by common nursery lake, or independently. These results emphasize that the most appropriate organizational scale to model salmon stocks will depend on specific management, scientific, or conservation goals.

Spatiotemporal glacier retreat on the Tibetan Plateau since the LGMG to early holocene based on compilation of moraine boulder ages	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding mountains (TPSM) have experienced prominent glacier retreat since the Global Last Glacial Maximum, while the detailed deglaciation process remains unclear. To investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of the glacier retreat history, we compiled 196 moraines dating from 26.5 to 10 ka based on 994 boulder 10Be exposure age from seven regions on the TPSM and calculated the separated component Gaussians of moraine ages. The result shows that synchronous glacier retreat across the entire TPSM began around 22 ka in response to onset of rising local summer insolation. Moraine abandonment centered at five stages, i.e., 22-20, 19-18 ka, 17-16, 14.5-12.9, and 11.6-10 ka. Synchronous retreat occurred at 22-20 ka and 14.5-12.9 ka in all seven regions, while at 19-18 ka, it occurred in all regions except Tianshan. Pamir and NE Tibet showed no retreat at 17-16 ka, likely due to the sustained influence of the Westerlies. The stage at 11.6-10 ka was absent in Central Tibet due to lack of chronology from the perched moraines therein. This work offers new insights into the evolution of the cryosphere and adjustments in atmospheric circulation on the TPSM.

In the first experiment, the zooplanktivorous fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) (primary carnivore), was reduced to 27% of its previous population size (53%) of biomass) by a selective rotenone treatment. In the second experiment, zander (Stizostedion lucioperca) (secondary carnivore), were stocked in the lake resulting in a reduction in the population size of roach to 51% of its previous population size (31% of biomass). In both experiments, seasonal average biomass of Daphnia cucullata) increased in the two years with the lowest roach biomasses. but no shift to larger zooplankton forms took place. In the years with increased Daphnia biomass, phytoplankton biomass and transparency showed an increased seasonal variation (measured as coefficient of variation). In contrast to manipulations in which planktivorous fish were totally removed, no effect on seasonal average phytoplankton biomass was observed. Due to the high reproductive capacity of roach, the system returned to previous conditions within a year or two after the perturbations. Under unperturbed conditions, the lake showed few indications of instability as suggested by the paradox of enrichment hypothesis. This lack of instability can. among other things, be related to high zooplanktivore predation pressure present in highly productive lakes preventing overexploitation of primary producers by grazers. In addition, the omnivorous feeding characteristics of roach (feeding on both zooplankton and algae/detritus) and interactions between the open water and the detritus nutrient pool are likely to increase the stability of the system. The two perturbation experiments plus a previous natural experiment (winter fish kill), which all were pulsed perturbations, provide no evidence for the presence of alternative stable states in highly productive lakes. Possibly, a sustained perturbation over several years may shift highly productive lakes from a dominance of phytoplankton production to a dominance of macrophyte production leading to an alternative state.

The Drangajokull ice cap, northwest Iceland, persisted into the early-mid Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Most glaciers and ice caps in Iceland experienced rapid deglaciation in the early Holocene, reaching a minimum extent during the Holocene Thermal Maximum. Here we present evidence of the Holocene glacial history from lake sediment cores retrieved from seven threshold lakes around the Drangajokull ice cap in the Vestfiroir peninsula, NW Iceland. The sediment cores show on/off signals of glacial meltwater activity, as minerogenic material deposited from glacial meltwater alternates with organic rich material (gyttja) deposited without glacial meltwater. We base the chronology of the sediment cores on C-14 ages and geochemical identification of key tephra layers with known ages. A 25-cm thick layer of the Saksunarvatn tephra in Lake Skorarvatn indicates that the northern part of the ice cap had reached a similar size as today or was smaller already by 10.2 cal kyr BP. However, C-14 ages of lake sediment cores from the highlands southeast of Drangajokull suggest that this part of the ice cap was larger than today until 7.8-7.2 cal kyr BP. Even today, the Drangajokull ice cap has a different behavior than the main ice caps in Iceland, characterized by a very low glaciation limit. Because palaeoclimatic proxies show an early-mid Holocene temperature optimum in this part of Iceland, we suggest that the persistence of Drangajokull into the early Holocene and, possibly, also the entire Holocene was due to high winter precipitation.

J	Stott, N; Miner, J				Stott, Nathan; Miner, Jeffrey			Environmental Cues of Spawning Migration into a Confined Wetland by Northern Pike and Common Carp in Lake Erie: Identifying Fine-Scale Patterns	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Restoration of wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes is designed to improve numerous ecosystem services including nutrient sequestration, support recreational uses, augment waterfowl habitat, and provide spawning and nursery habitat for fish. These projects often use Northern Pike Esox lucius, as a sentinel species for assessing restoration success because of their obligate use of emergent and submergent vegetation by the early life stages. However, invasive species such as Common Carp Cyprinus carpio also utilize these habitats and can have negative effects. Thus, fostering the use of these wetlands by Northern Pike and limiting access by invasive carp is a common restoration management concern. Using a dual frequency sonar system to observe fish migration in a recently connected Lake Erie coastal wetland, we were able to identify fine-scale environmental correlates to immigration by each species during early spring. Both species overwhelmingly migrated during daylight hours and against the flow of water that was generated through seiche-driven water oscillations. However, Northern Pike predominantly immigrated during the initial increase in water temperature immediately after ice-out; Common Carp also began to enter the wetland at low temperatures shortly after ice-out, but immigration exhibited a slow exponentially increasing pattern, such that the primary immigration timing differed by almost 30 d. Thus, we demonstrate common fine-scale spawning migration patterns (i.e., water oscillation effects and time of day) for both species and reinforce the temperature-correlated differences in spawning migration. Using these results could enable managers of connected wetlands to more precisely and dynamically manage habitat accessibility for desired species like Northern Pike while better regulating invasive Common Carp spawning migration and use of these systems.

This study assessed water quality parameters in relation to phycocyanin (PC) as a proxy indicator for harmful algal blooms (HABs). Samples were collected from 23 water sources - lakes, wells, springs and boreholes - in selected villages, for six months. Parameters measured included temperature, pH, redox potential, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, phosphorus, reactive phosphate and total chlorophyll, which were related to (PC) occurrence. The PC concentration detected in Lake Victoria ranged from 5 to 58.4 mu g/l above the WHO alert level and exceeded that in other water sources by almost 30 mu g/l (P < 0.001). Univariate relationship between water quality parameters and PC indicates association with temperature, redox potential, total chlorophyll, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, phosphate and reactive phosphorus (P < 0.001). The multivariate model indicates that redox potential, nitrate nitrogen and phosphorus are significant statistically (P < 0.05). A predictive model indicates that nitrate nitrogen and reactive phosphorus contribute significantly to PC occurrence whereby unit (1 mg/l) increases in these parameters increase PC by 9.55 and 4.38 mu g/l (P < 0.05) respectively. This study demonstrates that water quality parameters can be used to predict increases in PC and hence as a proxy for HABs. It remains important to be able to classify algal blooms, to understand which species are present and their potential cyanotoxin production.

A lake-wide approach for large lake zooplankton monitoring: Results from the 2006-2016 Lake Superior Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative surveys	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Whole-lake surveys of Lake Superior were completed during late summer in 2006, 2011, and 2016 to assess lower food web conditions under the Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative (CSMI). These surveys used a spatially stratified probability approach based on depth to assess food web conditions within different depth zones. We evaluated differences in crustacean zooplankton biomass, rotifer density, and the community structure of both groups in nearshore (<30 m), midshore (30-100 m), and offshore (>100 m) depth zones and investigated changes in these parameters within zones over time. Although nearshore crustacean biomasses and rotifer densities were highly variable, the depth zones differed from each other based on these parameters and should be considered separately. Crustacean biomass, community structure, and vertical position were consistent over time across depth zones. The differences that did occur were within the range of known annual variability. Total rotifer densities were lower in 2016 than in 2006 in all depth zones, but the genera that contributed to the lower values were not the same across zones. Further studies are needed to know whether these differences reflect annual variability or long-term trends. Finally, we show how the depth zones used in this study can facilitate comparisons between monitoring programs. This is important because most zooplankton studies are limited to certain depth zones and changes in zooplankton parameters may not occur uniformly across zones. The high variability in nearshore zooplankton parameters suggests that additional research may be needed to effectively track changes there.

Knowledge of these characteristics is critical for future international studies such as deep ice-core drilling. The assessment shows that: (1) Dome A is characterized by a very low 10 m depth firn temperature, -58.3 degrees C (nearly 3 degrees C lower than at EPICA Dome C and 1 degrees C lower than at Vostok). (2) Automatic weather station (AWS) measurements of snow surface height and reference layers in a snow pit indicate the present-day snow accumulation rate at Dome A is within the range 1-3 cm w.e. a(-1). Densification models suggest a range of 1-2 cm w.e. a(-1). This is lower than at other sites along the ice divide of East Antarctica (IDEA). Annual layers at Dome A are thus potentially thinner than at other sites, so that a longer record is preserved in a given ice thickness. (3) The average wind speed observed at Dome A (<4 m s(-1)) is lower than at other sites along IDEA. Together, these parameters, combined with radio-echo sounding data and information on the subglacial drainage distribution beneath Dome A, suggest Dome A as a candidate site for obtaining the oldest ice core.

The 1996 AD delta collapse and large turbidite in Lake Brienz	MARINE GEOLOGY												In spring 1996 AD, the occurrence of a large mass-transport was detected by a series of events, which happened in Lake Brienz, Switzerland: turbidity increase and oxygen depletion in deep waters, release of an old corpse into surface waters and occurrence of a small tsunami-like wave. This mass-transport generated a large turbidite deposit, which is studied here by combining high-resolution seismic and sedimentary cores. This turbidite deposit correlates to a prominent onlapping unit in the seismic record. Attaining a maximum of 96 cin in thickness, it is longitudinally graded and thins out towards the end of the lake basin. Thickness distribution map shows that the turbidite extends over similar to 8.5 km(2) and has a total volume of 2.72 * 10(6) m(3), which amounts to similar to 8.7 yr of the lake's annual sediment input. It consists of normally graded sand to silt-sized sediment containing clasts of hemipelagic sediments, topped by a thin, white, clay-sized layer. The source area, the exact dating and the possible trigger of this turbidite deposit, as well as its flow mechanism and ecological impact are presented along with environmental data (river inflow, wind and lake-level measurements). The combined results indicate that no particular cause (i.e., earthquake, explosion, flood, wind storm, lake-level change, seiche or sediment dredging) triggered the 1996 AD large turbidite deposit. Instead, it was due to a delta slope failure most likely caused by normal sediment accumulation, (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Tsambagarav, Mongolian Altai)	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												This study investigates the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazards in the Tsambagarav mountain range in Western Mongolia, focusing on the Khukhnuruu Valley and its interconnected proglacial lakes. Over the last 30 years, significant glacier retreats, driven by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, have led to the formation and expansion of several proglacial lakes. Fieldwork combined with satellite data and meteorological analysis was used to assess the dynamics of glacier and lake area changes, with particular focus on the flood events of July 2021. The research reveals a substantial reduction in glacier area, particularly in the Khukhnuruu E complex, where glacier area decreased by 19.3%. The study highlights the influence of increasing temperatures and summer precipitation, which have accelerated ice melt, contributing to the expansion and eventual breaching of lakes. Additionally, lake area changes were influenced by the steepness of the terrain, with steeper slopes exacerbating peak discharge during floods. Of the studied seven lakes (Lake 1 to Lake 7), Lake 1 experienced the most dramatic reduction, with a decrease in area by 73.51% and volume by 84.84%, followed by Lake 7. This study underscores the region's vulnerability to climate-induced hazards and stresses the need for a comprehensive early warning system and disaster preparedness measures to mitigate future risks.					; Demberel, Otgonbayar/MEK-9203-2025; Singh, Atul/AAE-3213-2020; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/Q-6986-2018; Chakraborty, Elora/LKN-4065-2024; DASH, CHINMAY/O-4506-2018; Seong, Yeong Bae/K-2420-2019	Chakraborty, Elora/0000-0002-6342-8763; Demberel, Otgonbayar/0000-0001-9748-3392; Dorjsuren, Batsuren/0000-0002-7864-8291; Gankhuyag, Nemekhbayar/0009-0000-2326-9932; Singh, Atul Kumar/0000-0002-7917-1042; Seong, Yeong Bae/0000-0001-6605-3912													1672-6316	1993-0321				OCT	2024	21	10					3215	3233		10.1007/s11629-024-9054-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-024-9054-5													WOS:001344510200005

However, how climate warming affects litter decomposition is still unclear in lake ecosystems. Here, we tested the effects of constant and variable warming on the bacterial metabolic potential of typically submerged macrophyte (Potamogeton crispus L.) litters during decomposition in 18 mesocosms (2500 L each). The results showed that warming reduced main chemoheterotrophic metabolic potential but promoted methylotrophy metabolism, which means that further warming may alter methane-cycling microbial metabolism. The nitrate reduction function was inhibited under warming treatments, and nitrogen fixation capability significantly increased under variable warming in summer. The changes in dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, conductivity and ammonium nitrogen driven by warming are the main environmental factors affecting the bacteria's metabolic potential. The effects of warming and environmental factors on fermentation, nitrate reduction and ammonification capabilities in stem and leaf litter were different, and the bacterial potential in the stem litter were more strongly responsive to environmental factors. These findings suggest that warming may considerably alter bacterial metabolic potential in macrophyte litter, contributing to long-term positive feedback between the C and N cycle and climate.					; Yan, Yifeng/LSI-7240-2024; Cheng, Haowu/KHV-4555-2024; shi, penglan/HHC-2281-2022	Feng, Mingjun/0000-0001-5050-5005; Cheng, Haowu/0000-0002-5464-3111; Shi, Penglan/0000-0002-5570-2072														2076-2607				JUL	2022	10	7							1327	10.3390/microorganisms10071327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10071327								35889044					WOS:000831492300001

To characterize lake ecological status, epiphytic and epilithic diatom samples were collected from the lakeshore in summer 2005, 2013, and 2017. However, in 2017 no macrophytes were present, such that only epilithic diatom samples could be collected. After laboratory analysis, 52 diatom taxa were identified in July 2005, 67 in June 2013, 111 in August 2013, and 126 in August 2017. The generaDiatoma,Epithemia,Fragilaria,andSurirellawere not recorded in 2017, contrary to previous years. We applied two diatom indices to asses the ecological status of the Great Lake, IPS (Indice de Polluo-sensibilite), and TDIL (Trophic Diatom Index for lakes). The IPS index indicated very good water quality in all years, while the TDIL indicated moderate water quality in 2005 and 2013 and good water quality in 2017. Because more species have indicator values for calculating the IPS than the TDIL (valve number used to calculate the IPS was above 95%, while for TDIL was below 50% of 400 counted valves), the IPS may be a more promising tool for bioindication of lakes in Albania according to the demands of the Water Framework Directive.

In an upland catchment, the major sources of DOC were precipitation, vegetation, and soil organic matter, resulting in a summer (June to October) export of 2.1 g.m(-2). DOC concentrations in peat pore water ranged from 20 to 60 mg.L-1 and were related to hydrologic pathways. DOC export from catchments containing wetlands ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 g.m(-2) and export from the peatland portion of the catchment was estimated to be 28-30 g.m(-2). Flooding to a depth of 1.2 in in the peatland section of one catchment resulted in an increase in pore-water and pond DOC concentrations, attributed to the decomposition of plant tissues and peat. Because only 14% of the catchment was flooded, impoundment did not result in a significant increase in DOC export. Between 85 and 93% of DOC was contained in the acid fractions, with small amounts in the neutral fractions. Flooding increased the proportion of the hydrophilic neutral fraction in peat pore waters for 2 years after flooding.

We present the first temporally continuous and most spatially extensive pollen-based land-cover reconstruction for Europe over the Holocene (last 11 700 cal yr BP). We describe how vegetation cover has been quantified from pollen records at a 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial scale using the "Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites" (REVEALS) model. REVEALS calculates estimates of past regional vegetation cover in proportions or percentages. REVEALS has been applied to 1128 pollen records across Europe and part of the eastern Mediterranean-Black Sea-Caspian corridor (30-75 degrees N, 25 degrees W-50 degrees E) to reconstruct the percentage cover of 31 plant taxa assigned to 12 plant functional types (PFTs) and 3 land-cover types (LCTs). A new synthesis of relative pollen productivities (RPPs) for European plant taxa was performed for this reconstruction. It includes multiple RPP values (>= 2 values) for 39 taxa and single values for 15 taxa (total of 54 taxa). To illustrate this, we present distribution maps for five taxa (Calluna vulgaris, Cerealia type (t)., Picea abies, deciduous Quercus t. and evergreen Quercus t.) and three land-cover types (open land, OL; evergreen trees, ETs; and summer-green trees, STs) for eight selected time windows. The reliability of the REVEALS reconstructions and issues related to the interpretation of the results in terms of landscape openness and human-induced vegetation change are discussed. This is followed by a review of the current use of this reconstruction and its future potential utility and development. REVEALS data quality are primarily determined by pollen count data (pollen count and sample, pollen identification, and chronology) and site type and number (lake or bog, large or small, one site vs. multiple sites) used for REVEALS analysis (for each grid cell). A large number of sites with high-quality pollen count data will produce more reliable land-cover estimates with lower standard errors compared to a low number of sites with lower-quality pollen count data.

Don't count your eggs before they resorb: Early collection of ovarian follicles influences estimates of Lake Trout fecundity in Yellowstone Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveUnderstanding recruitment dynamics is necessary to predict population-level responses to exploitation, management actions, or anthropogenic influences. Fecundity is commonly used as a metric of recruitment dynamics and can guide successful management of fisheries. However, an individual female's fecundity is not constant over time; females resorb ovarian follicles to regulate fecundity as they approach spawning. This suggests that sampling for fecundity too early may produce inaccurate estimates of relative fecundity. In Yellowstone National Park, suppression of invasive Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush reduced the abundance of mature fish by 92% between 2012 and 2022. The continued efficacy of this suppression effort requires accurate assessments of reproductive potential of the population that remains.MethodsWe sought to determine whether the timing of ovarian follicle collection affected estimates of mean relative fecundity. We collected ovarian follicles from female Lake Trout, which are autumn spawners, between mid-August and early October in 2021 and 2022. The number of ovarian follicles per sample was counted to obtain estimates of relative fecundity for each female.ResultWe observed a 13% decline in estimated mean relative fecundity between individuals that were sampled before mid-September and those that were sampled after mid-September.ConclusionOur data support strategic timing of fecundity sampling to best capture the true reproductive capability of a population, which is a key metric used in models that guide adaptive management of fishes. Impact statement Female Lake Trout undergo fecundity reduction through follicular atresia, reducing the number of ovarian follicles that may be spawned, which suggests that fecundity estimates based on fish that are sampled too early in the reproductive cycle will be inaccurate.

Spatial ecology of the white-clawed crayfish in an upland stream and implications for the conservation of this endangered species	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Populations of white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) have undergone substantial declines across Europe. Remaining populations tend to be fragmented and in many catchments they are restricted to upland streams. Information is needed concerning their spatial ecology to assist with conservation and rehabilitation of existing fragmented populations, as well as possible reintroductions. 2. A novel method for the long-term tagging of white-clawed crayfish was used to study the spatial ecology of a white-clawed crayfish population fragment in a small, moderate-gradient upland stream. Internal passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags enabled adult crayfish (carapace length > 27 mm) to be permanently tagged, each with a unique identification code and resulted in a high number of recaptures. Of 501 crayfish tagged 413 were subsequently relocated at least once. 3. Crayfish did not make extensive movements, the median annual distance moved was 84.8 m yr(-1), equivalent to annual net movement of 0.233 m day(-1), substantially less than reported in previous studies. The lower levels of movement may reflect the study encompassing all seasons, including winter, when crayfish are relatively inactive. 4. Significantly more crayfish moved downstream compared with upstream and distances moved downstream were significantly greater than those in an upstream direction. This may be linked to the relatively high gradient of the stream and a reduced passability of the abundant riffles to upstream movements of crayfish. 5. A small weir acted as a barrier within the stream, preventing upstream movements of crayfish. Even small barriers may limit the movements of white-clawed crayfish and have the potential to limit connectivity within populations and prevent expansion or recolonization. 6. The results presented suggest that fragmented populations of white-clawed crayfish in upland streams are unlikely to expand rapidly and reconnect to other population fragments, even where habitat is suitable. In establishing stream populations care should be taken to ensure that even small barriers to movement are removed unless these are intended to exclude non-native biota, especially crayfish.

J	HENDZEL, LL; HEALEY, FP				HENDZEL, LL; HEALEY, FP			EXTRACTION OF ALGAL ATP AND INTERPRETATION OF MEASUREMENTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												ATP samples collected by direct injection were compared with those collected by filtration from exponential and P-limited algal cultures, and from summer populations of several lakes. The direct injection method yielded higher amounts of measurable ATP than did filtration on 2.5 and 4.5 cm diameter membrane filters. ATP lost to the filtrate was negligible. Variation in ATP content with increasing nutrient deficiency was measured in 6 cultures. ATP/C decreased with N deficiency and to a greater degree with P deficiency. Large changes of ATP/C usually occurred with litte change in viability of the cells. Short-term (1 h) nutrient enrichments generally did not change the ATP/C ratio. P deficiency tended to increase the chlorophyll/ATP ratio and N deficiency to decrease it. The short- and long-term effects of alkaline phosphatase on ATP extracts from P-sufficient and P-deficient Scenedesmus quadricauda were negligible. There appeared to be little effect on frozen ATP samples stored up to 60 days. Any short-term effects were similarly negligible, since temperature and the addition of P did not affect the rate of ATP loss. The use of 0.33 mol H3PO4 .cntdot. l-1 as an extractant proved to be completely unreliable.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	11					1601	1608		10.1139/f84-198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-198													WOS:A1984TU43000007

This conflict, considering the income of different sectors and environmental issues, is very crucial, especially in reservoir operation. In this study, a multi-objective optimization algorithm combined with two simulation models (SWAT and WEAP) has been developed to consider the tradeoff between agricultural benefit and environmental water demand through parallel processing. In this model, decision variables are monthly agricultural demands which are considered as inputs into the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. Then, the production of different crops and discharge to the downstream lake are obtained based on the allocated water to each sector using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. After the simulation, the objective functions are calculated based on agricultural income and environmental flow discharged to the downstream lake. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Mahabad reservoir, in Mahabad river basin (located at the south of the Lake Urmia and northwestern of Iran), was studied during a drought period. This reservoir supplies domestic, industry, agriculture water of the Mahabad plain and downstream environmental demand which is discharged to the Lake Urmia. Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) algorithm is used to find the optimal water allocation to different sectors and efficient agricultural irrigation patterns of different crops (winter wheat, alfalfa, apple, and sugar beet). Results showed the optimal operation of the reservoir through irrigation management could improve water stress indicator from 80% in traditional irrigation pattern to 60%, only by 6.5% decrease in agricultural income. Also, the inflow to Urmia Lake was increased from 173 MCM to 354 MCM during the drought period (5 years).

Assessment of branched GDGTs as temperature proxies in sedimentary records from several small lakes in southwestern Greenland	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												This study of five small (<3.0 ha) lakes in southwestern Greenland examines the veracity of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (br GDGTs) as a temperature proxy in lacustrine systems. The proximity (<5 km) of the lakes suggests that their temperature history, and thus their br GDGT records, should be similar. Distributions of br GDGTs in (i) surface sediments from all five lakes, (ii) C-14-dated sediment cores from two lakes (Upper and Lower EVV Lakes) and (iii) soil samples from the area surrounding the lakes were examined. The temporal records of br GDGT-based temperature for the two cores exhibited both similarities and major discrepancies. The differences between the paleotemperature records for the two lakes suggest that br GDGTs are not solely soil-derived, reflecting air temperature, but also indicate an additional br GDGT contribution from another source. Among the broader suite of lake sediments, there was a strong correlation (R-2 0.987) between br GDGT-based surface sediment temperatures and measured summer bottom water temperatures for the four lakes with hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters, including Upper EVV Lake. The correlation suggests production of br GDGTs by anaerobic bacteria within the bottom water and/or sediment-water interface, reflecting environmental temperature for the individual lakes and augmenting the uniform, soil-derived signal. Hence, assessment of br GDGTs in Greenland lake sediments provides evidence for their origin from anaerobic autochthonous bacteria and indicates that interpretation of lacustrine br GDGT-based paleotemperature records requires contextual knowledge of individual lake systems and potential source(s) of sedimentary br GDGTs.

J	Sellergren, M; Li, J; Drakare, S; Thöns, S				Sellergren, Maja; Li, Jing; Drakare, Stina; Thons, Sebastian			Decision Support for Lake Restoration: A Case Study in Swedish Freshwater Bodies	WATER												A considerable number of lakes in Sweden have high phosphorus internal loading from the sediments which cause cyanobacterial blooms every summer. Due to potential risks with such blooms for human health, drinking water supply, and ecosystem services, measures need to be taken to control the phosphorus content. Measures to control the phosphorus input from the surrounding land has been in focus. However, the measures have not been sufficient. This is because phosphorus deposited at the bottom of the lakes for many years are finally starting to leak to the water phase when the decomposition of sediments leads to anoxic conditions. In order to determine effective and efficient lake restoration measures, methods for lake restoration decision support by a multi-criteria analysis and the application of a decision analysis are developed. The multi-criteria analysis includes the determination of costs, longevity, and efficacy of six common lake restoration measures to reduce internal phosphorous loads in two lakes selected as a case study. The results show that aluminum treatment combines a highest efficacy with a high-cost efficiency being thus the optimal identified measure. The method involves adding an aluminum solution to the lakes' sediment, which binds phosphorus, preventing it to be released to the water column. The multi-criteria model is integrated to a decision analytical model. The decision analytical model is used to identify the monetary socio-economic and environmental boundaries for the implementation of the optimal lake restoration measure.					; Drakare, Stina/D-4532-2016; Drakare, Stina/ABF-1259-2020; Li, Jing/AFI-0451-2022	Li, Jing/0000-0001-9632-0452; Drakare, Stina/0000-0002-7389-2105; Thons, Sebastian/0000-0002-7714-3312														2073-4441				FEB	2023	15	4							668	10.3390/w15040668	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15040668													WOS:000942385900001

Rotifer abundance (#/m(3)) for many common taxa such as Polyarthra. Kellicottia, and Keratella declined lakewide in the mid-1990s which coincided with the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) into Lake Champlain. The only rotifer to increase in density following zebra mussel invasion was Conochilus which is a colonial species. Long-term shifts in copepod and cladoceran community composition can be attributed to the arrival of another invasive species in 2004-2005, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Our results support previous findings that alewife predation can impact larger bodied zooplankton within temperate lake systems. Following alewife invasion into Lake Champlain, body length of Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia retrocurva decreased to a size at or below known alewife feeding preferences. In addition, smaller bodied copepods (primarily Diacyclops thomasi) have increased in abundance since alewife invasion while juvenile copepods have declined. Our results suggest that post-alewife zooplankton patterns are most likely due to alewife size-selective feeding strategies. Observed long-term changes in zooplankton community structure have potential implications for the lake's food web dynamics, particularly recent declines in large bodied zooplankton which may release smaller plankton from top-down control.

Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria of the Meromictic Lake Bol'shie Khruslomeny (Oleniy Island, Kandalaksha Gulf, Murmansk Oblast, Russia)	MICROBIOLOGY												The composition and structure of the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial (APB) community in the water column of meromictic Lake Bol'shie Khruslomeny during winter were investigated. The community developed at the depth of 4.25 m, and its activity in the ice-cover period was very low (6.2 mu mol C L-1 day(-1)). The water in the zone of highest development of phototrophic bacteria was of an unusual lemon-yellow color, probably due to the production and accumulation of polysulfides. The near-bottom water was also of lemon-yellow color and was resistant to oxidation by the air oxygen. In the zone of peak APB development the content of BChl d from green-colored green sulfur bacteria was considerably higher than that of BChl e from brown-colored green sulfur bacteria: 77 and 23%, respectively. The cultures of green and purple sulfur bacteria were isolated from lake water, and their physiological and genetic characteristics were determined. Two strains of green sulfur bacteria (brown-colored BrKhr17 and green-colored GrKhr17) contained gas vacuoles in their cells. Phylogenetically they were most closely related to the green-colored strain Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM 265 and were identified as new strains of the species Chlorobium phaeovibrioides.

J	PETRELL, RJ; SMERAGE, GH; BAGNALL, LO				PETRELL, RJ; SMERAGE, GH; BAGNALL, LO			MATHEMATICAL SIMULATION OF A WATER HYACINTH (EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES) TOWING SYSTEM	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE												A mathematical model representing a water hyacinth towing system of moderate size was formulated as a network of mechanical components. The system consisted of a rectangular device enclosing water hyacinth mats of various shapes and sizes and towing them by an applied input velocity. Three physical properties of a mat were found to be significant: viscous drag of plant rhizomes in water, viscous friction of leaves sliding over each other during compaction, and masses of the mat and accelerated water. Mass of the enclosure and a spring in the enclosure for measuring towing force also was incorporated in the model. Descriptions of the components and their interconnections were based on experimental observations and physical and hydromechanical fundamentals. Analyses of model behaviour were performed for towing velocity less than 0.4 m/s, the experimentally observed velocity at the onset of mat instability. Effects of different acceleration patterns, mat physical characteristics, and towing velocity on system behaviour were investigated in physical experiments and simulations with the model. The model and new information upon which it was based permit engineering design of different types of systems for harvesting water hyacinths in sewage treatment, canals, and lakes.																			0001-2351					SEP-OCT	1992	35	5					1691	1698																WOS:A1992KJ55400047

The land cover of Siberia is characterized by uncertainty because it is wide-ranging and comprises various classification types. However, comparisons among land cover products reveal substantial discrepancies and uncertainties. Therefore, a reliable land cover product for Siberia is necessary. In this study, we generated new land cover data for Siberia using random forest (RF) classifiers with global land cover datasets. To assess their accuracy and characteristics, we individually validated global land cover products in Siberia using multi-source sample datasets. We trained the RF classifiers with multiple land cover products to produce a more precise land cover product for Siberia. The validations showed that: (a) the generated new land cover data achieved the highest overall accuracy (85.04%) and kappa coefficient (82.62%); (b) the classifications of mixed forest (user accuracy: 97.85%) and grasses (user accuracy: 94.85%) demonstrated improvements, showing higher performance compared to most other types; and (c) by comparing the distribution of land cover across climate zones, we discovered that temperature is a critical factor throughout Siberia. However, in warm summer climates, precipitation plays a critical role in vegetation distribution. The more accurate and detailed land cover created in this study enhances the reliability of analyses in Siberia and fosters a deeper understanding of the impact of the carbon cycle.					; Zhang, Beichen/HQZ-2414-2023; Ichii, Kazuhito/D-2392-2010; WANG, RUCI/AGR-3428-2022; Hiyama, Tetsuya/M-2723-2014; Sharma, Ram/AAY-5929-2021	Wang, Ruci/0000-0001-7049-7006; Ichii, Kazuhito/0000-0002-8696-8084; 													2197-4284					JAN 6	2025	12	1							3	10.1186/s40645-024-00672-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-024-00672-5													WOS:001390562600002

Millennial-Scale Climate and Human Drivers of Environmental Change and Fire Activity in a Dry, Mixed-Conifer Forest of Northwestern Montana	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE												Warm summer temperatures and longer fire seasons are promoting larger, and in some cases, more fires that are severe in low- and mid-elevation, dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains (NRM). Long-term historical fire conditions and human influence on past fire activity are not well understood for these topographically and biophysically heterogeneous forests. We developed reconstructions of millennial-scale fire activity, vegetation change, and human presence at Black Lake, a small closed-basin lake on the Flathead Indian Reservation in the Mission Valley, Northwestern Montana, United States. Fossil pollen, charcoal, and biomarkers associated with human presence were used to evaluate the interaction between climate variability, fire activity, vegetation change and human activity for the past 7000 years. Comparisons among multiple proxies suggest climate variability acted as the primary control on fire activity and vegetation change from the early Holocene until the late Holocene when records suggest fire activity and climate variability decoupled. Specific biomarkers (5 beta-stanols including coprostanol and epi-coprostanol) associated with human presence indicate humans were present within the Black Lake watershed for thousands of years, although the inferred intensity of human presence is highly variable. A strong relationship between climate variability and fire activity during the early and mid-Holocene weakens during the last few thousand years, suggesting possible increased influence of humans in mediating fire activity in recent millennia, and/or a shift in the interaction between the distribution and abundance of woody fuel and fire severity. Human-set fires during the cooler and wetter late Holocene may have been aimed at maintaining important cultural resources associated with the heterogeneous mosaic of mixed conifer forests within the Black Lake watershed. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction at Black Lake corroborates archeological records that show humans were present within the Black Lake watershed for over 7000 years. Further research is needed to evaluate the evidence for this continuous presence and the possible role that people played in shaping fire regimes and vegetation within low- to mid-elevation mixed-conifer ecosystems of the NRM.					; Argiriadis, Elena/ABD-4415-2020	Argiriadis, Elena/0000-0001-7227-405X; McWethy, David/0000-0003-3879-4865; 														2624-893X				APR 17	2020	3								44	10.3389/ffgc.2020.00044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00044													WOS:000556473500001

It is usually applied to farm fields in the spring before or after the corn crop emerges. A version of the WASP4 mass balance model, LM2-Atrazine, was used to assess the impact of the historical and future usage of this chemical on lake water concentrations. Long-term model forecasts were performed under various sensitivity and potential management scenarios. The model was calibrated to available lake data and results indicate that atrazine, under average conditions, is decaying very slowly in the lake (0.009/year). This kinetic decay translates into a half-life estimate of 77 years. If the average condition scenario were assumed to remain constant into the future and reflective of conditions in January 1, 2005, it is expected that the lake (excluding Green Bay) would eventually reach a volume-weighted average atrazine concentration of approximately 67 ng/L in the year 2157 (current model prediction is 48 ng/L for year 2011). These forecasted lake-wide concentrations are below known water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic ecosystems.

GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Predicted increases in water temperature in response to climate change will have large implications for aquatic ecosystems, such as altering thermal habitat and potential range expansion of fish species. Warmwater fish species, such as smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, may have access to additional favourable thermal habitat under increased surface-water temperatures, thereby shifting the northern limit of the distribution of the species further north in Canada and potentially negatively impacting native fish communities. We assembled a database of summer surface-water temperatures for over 13 000 lakes across Canada. The database consists of lakes with a variety of physical, chemical and biological properties. We used general linear models to develop a nation-wide maximum lake surface-water temperature model. The model was extended to predict surface-water temperatures suitable to smallmouth bass and under climate-change scenarios. Air temperature, latitude, longitude and sampling time were good predictors of present-day maximum surface-water temperature. We predicted lake surface-water temperatures for July 2100 using three climate-change scenarios. Water temperatures were predicted to increase by as much as 18 degrees C by 2100, with the greatest increase in northern Canada. Lakes with maximum surface-water temperatures suitable for smallmouth bass populations were spatially identified. Under several climate-change scenarios, we were able to identify lakes that will contain suitable thermal habitat and, therefore, are vulnerable to invasion by smallmouth bass in 2100. This included lakes in the Arctic that were predicted to have suitable thermal habitat by 2100.

Accordingly, physicochemical parameters from 77 groundwater wells were assessed using multivariate statistics and hydrogeochemical analysis in case of groundwater salinity and quality of Azarshahr plain. Based on the electric conductivity of the water, the results show that almost 41% of the wells are freshwater (< 1000 mu S/cm), 18% slightly saline water (1000-3000 mu S/cm), and 42% moderately saline water (3000-10,000 mu S/cm). Based on Gibbs plot, rock weathering was a dominant process in the plain so that about 80.7% of the samples fall under very hard class. Results from Principle Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis divided the groundwater into four distinct zones: cluster 1 in the western area of the plain is known as recharge zone (Ca-HCO3 water type), cluster 2 northwest of the study area is influenced by saline water up-coning during agriculture pumping (Ca-Cl water type), cluster 3 north of the study area is affected by rock weathering (Ca-HCO3-Cl water type), and finally cluster 4 in the central plain is mostly influenced by wastewater and agricultural fertilizers (Ca-SO4-Cl water type). It was also found that there are high concentrations of TDS, Cl-, and SO42- in the agricultural areas which was also showing an increasing trend within 2010-2014. Finally, it was found that agricultural activity, contamination and salinization from irrigation, use of fertilities, and up-coning salt water during pumping are among the factors in deterioration of groundwater resources in the studied area.

Utah and Salt Lake valleys had high levels of PM10 pollution that violated both the annual and 24-h standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Much lower PM10 levels occurred in the Cache Valley. Utah Valley experienced the intermittent operation of its primary source of PM10 pollution: an integrated steel mill. Bronchitis and asthma admissions for preschool-age children were approximately twice as frequent in Utah Valley when the steel mill was operating versus when it was not. Similar differences were not observed in Salt Lake or Cache valleys. Even though Cache Valley had higher smoking rates and lower temperatures in winter than did Utah Valley, per capita bronchitis and asthma admissions for all ages were approximately twice as high in Utah Valley. During the period when the steel mill was closed, differences in per capita admissions between Utah and Cache valleys narrowed considerably. Regression analysis also demonstrated a statistical association between respiratory hospital admissions and PM10 pollution. The results suggest that PM10 pollution plays a role in the incidence and severity of respiratory disease.

J	Martínez-Almeida, V; Tavera, R				Martínez-Almeida, V; Tavera, R			A hydrobiological study to interpret the presence of desmids in Lake Zirahuen, Mexico	LIMNOLOGICA												Monthly collections of phytoplankton were supported by physical-chemical data and measures of chlorophyll a concentrations in the search for particular environmental factors that could explain the constant presence of desmids in a Mexican tropical lake, a characteristic not common among the phytoplanktic communities of Mexican lakes. Samplings were taken from the water column in the deepest part of the lake (40 m) and intensified in the metalimnetic zone, whose establishment was monitored by observations of temperature and oxygen profiles. The general behavior of Lake Zirahuen was typical of warm monomictic tropical lakes at high elevation: a short mixing phase during the hemispheric winter. The depth of Z(MIX) and Z(eu) revealed a well-illuminated epilimnion, suggesting that phytoplankton communities are not likely to be light-limited. The oligotrophic nature of the lake is indicated by discrete concentrations of inorganic nutrients, P-TOT in the interval of 0.01-0.03 mg 1(-1) and chlorophyll a between 0.23 and 3.98 mu g 1(-1). These characteristics together with a low concentration of calcium, define a lacustrine environment different from other Mexican lakes, and one that could be suitable for desmids communities.

J	Lee, KH; Kam, J				Lee, Kwang-Hun; Kam, Jonghun			Spatiotemporal patterns of water volume and total organic carbon concentration of agricultural reservoirs over South Korea	WATER RESEARCH												Lacking of available water quality data causes the limited understanding of the coupled dynamics of hydrologic and nutrient cycles in lakes and reservoirs and along river streams. This study conducts the rotated Principal Component Analysis (rPCA) of water volume and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration data from similar to 2200 agricultural reservoirs in South Korea to extract the major modes of their spatiotemporal variability. Over 2020-2022, the total TOC load in the reservoirs ranges between 1,165 and 1,492 tons (289 and 360 Mtons of water storage volume; 3.54 and 4.60 mg/L of TOC concentration). The first rPCA mode is assoicated with a decreasing trend of water level (38 % of the explained variance) and increasing trend of TOC concentration (27 %) over the southern Korea region, where the TOC concentration increased during the 2022 drought. The second rPCA mode is associated with interannual variability of water level (25 %) and TOC concentration (18 %) over the central Korea region. This study found a marginal relationship between paddy field area and TOC concentration and their regime shift to high TOC concentration during the 2022 drought, which was a potential cause of the increased TOC concentration in 2022. This study provided observational evidence of interactions between water volume and TOC concentration during a severe drought, suggesting a possible shift of the role of agricultural reservoirs to carbon source.

Impact of bathers on levels of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts in recreational beach waters	WATER RESEARCH												Recreational beach water samples collected on weekends and weekdays during 11 consecutive summer weeks were tested for potentially viable Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and Giardia lamblia cysts using the multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method. The levels of oocysts and cysts on weekends were significantly higher than on the weekdays (P < 0.01). Concentrations of oocysts in weekend samples (n = 27) ranged from 2 to 42 oocysts/L (mean: 13.7 oocysts/L), and cyst concentration ranged from 0 to 33 cysts/L (mean: 9.1 cysts/L). For the samples collected on weekdays (n = 33), the highest oocyst concentration was 7 oocysts/L (mean: 1.5 oocysts/L), and the highest cyst concentration was 4 cysts/L (mean: 0.6 cysts/L). The values of water turbidity were significantly higher on weekends than on weekdays, and were correlated with the number of bathers and concentration of C. parvum oocysts and G. lamblia cysts (P<0.04). The study demonstrated positive relationships between number of bathers and levels of waterborne C. parvum oocysts and G. lamblia cysts in recreational beach water. It is essential to test recreational waters for Cryptosporidium and Giardia when numbers of bathers are greatest, or limit the number of bathers in a recreational beach area. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Qin, F				Qin, Feng			Modern pollen assemblages of the surface lake sediments from the steppe and desert zones of the Tibetan Plateau	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Modern pollen analysis is the basis for revealing the palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate changes from fossil pollen spectra. Many studies pertaining to the modern pollen assemblages on the Tibetan Plateau have been conducted, but little attention has been paid to pollen assemblages of surface lake sediments. In this study, modern pollen assemblages of surface lake sediments from 34 lakes in the steppe and desert zones of the Tibetan Plateau are investigated and results indicate that the two vegetation zones are dominated by non-arboreal pollen taxa and show distinctive characteristics. The pollen assemblages from the desert zone contain substantially high relative abundance of Chenopodiaceae while those from the steppe zone are dominated by Cyperaceae. Pollen ratios show great potential in terms of separating different vegetation zones and to indicate climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau. The Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae ratio and arboreal/non-arboreal pollen ratio could be used as proxies for winter precipitation. Artemisia/Cyperaceae ratio and the sum of relative abundance of xerophilous elements increase with enhanced warming and aridity. When considering the vegetation coverage around the lakes, hierarchical cluster analysis suggests that the studied sites can be divided into four clusters: meadow, steppe, desert-steppe, and desert. The pollen-based vegetation classification models are established using a random forest algorithm. The random forest model can effectively separate the modern pollen assemblages of the steppe zone from those of the desert zone on the Tibetan Plateau. The model for distinguishing the four vegetation clusters shows a weaker but still valid classifying power. It is expected that the random forest model can provide a powerful tool to reconstruct the palaeovegetation succession on the Tibetan Plateau when more pollen data from surface lake sediments are included.

J	Helsel, DR; Gerber, DT; Engel, S				Helsel, DR; Gerber, DT; Engel, S			Comparing spring treatments of 2,4-D with bottom fabrics to control a new infestation of Eurasian watermilfoil	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Control of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) at Beulah Lake, southeastern Wisconsin, was compared using a single treatment of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) in May 1993 at 80% of the maximum rate and polyvinyl-chloride bottom fabrics (0.50 mm thick) applied for 45 days from mid-May through early July 1993. A plastic curtain suspended across the outlet of each treatment cove kept 94 to 98% of the herbicide from drifting into open water. Both control methods eliminated Eurasian watermilfoil from treatment sites within 4 to 6 weeks. The bottom fabrics eliminated all species of rooted, submerged aquatic plants. The 2,4-D treatments initially reduced the mean standing crop of coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.), elodea (Elodea canadensis Michaux), variable-leaf watermilfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum Michaux), and wild celery (Vallisneria americana Michaux) by 14 to 85%. These native plants, however, recovered about 80% to 120% of their standing crops within 10 to 12 weeks after herbicide treatments, while transplants of these species showed poor colonization on sites previously covered with bottom fabrics. Herbicide concentrations in the water column at the treatment sites dropped 37 to 48% within 3 weeks of treatment and 70 to 82% within 6 weeks of treatment.																			0146-6623					JUL	1996	34						68	71																WOS:A1996VL34300007

In this study, a semianalytical algorithm, based on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 678 nm and 748 nm on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images was used to estimate the ratio of chlorophyll a to total suspended solids (Chla/TSS), which characterizes the particulate composition of the Great Lakes. The long-term spatial and temporal characteristics of Chla/TSS in the Great Lakes from 2000 to 2020 were obtained. The results demonstrated that Lake Superior had the highest average Chla/TSS values (5.79 & PLUSMN;0.76 mu g/mg), while Lake Erie had the lowest average Chla/TSS values (2.93 & PLUSMN;0.76 mu g/mg). The Mann -Kendall test showed that the Chla/TSS of the Great Lakes all showed an increasing trend, notably in Lake Michigan, with 88.23% pixels showing significant increasing trend. Climatic and hydrological factors dominated the intra-annual variation of Chla/TSS, with contribution rates ranging from 71.47% to 92.54%. Through the annual Chla/TSS change pattern analysis, it was found that the contribution of wind speed to the annual vari-ation in Chla/TSS was slight. Changes in temperature played a major role in the interannual variability of Chla/ TSS in Lake Superior and Ontario; runoff and settlement were the major contributors in Lake Huron and Michigan, while cropland dominated the Chla/TSS interannual variability in Lake Erie. Furthermore, the significantly low values of Chla/TSS in spring had the potential to predict the occurrence of blooms in western Lake Erie, and the spatial distribution of Chla/TSS could help predict the location of blooms in the next few days.

During Foehn events, tethered balloon soundings and wind profiler measurements were conducted in addition to the rawinsonde network which was built up for the MAP field campaign. The remote sensing instrument renders a surprisingly high number of valid data during south Foehn. Due to the frequent formation of a cold air pool with stable conditions below the Foehn flow with near-neutral static stability, even more sodar data is valid during Foehn periods than during no Foehn periods. A significant reduction of the sodar data quality is only observed during Foehn events with grounding of the Foehn at the sodar site due to high background noise. At higher levels, a Foehn signal can be detected from the sodar wind and turbulence intensitiy information. With Foehn, higher wind speeds and larger turbulence intensities occur than without Foehn. Comparisons to rawinsonde and tethersonde soundings and wind profiler measurements at sites nearby reveal the spatial inhomogeneity of the Foehn flow within this part of the valley as well as instrumental short-comings.

However, few studies have monitored plastic litter on lakebeds which are potentially important environments for determining the fate and transport of plastic litter in freshwater basins. In this study, a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus was used for litter collection at the lakebed along five transects in Lake Tahoe, United States. Litter was brought to the surface and characterized by litter type. Plastic litter was subsampled, and polymer composition was determined using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average plastic litter from the lakebed for the five dive transects was 83 +/- 49 items per kilometer. The top plastic litter categories were other plastic litter (plastic litter that did not fall in another category), followed by food containers, bottles <2 L, plastic bags, and toys. These results are in line with prior studies on submerged litter, and intervention approaches or ongoing education are needed. The six polymers most frequently detected in the subsamples were polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene/expanded polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate/polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyamide. These observations reflect global plastic production and microplastic studies from lake surface water and sediments. We found that some litter subcategories were primarily comprised of a single polymer type, therefore, in studies where the polymer type cannot be measured but litter is categorized, these results could provide an estimate of the total polymer composition for select litter categories.

Of crucial importance has been the estimation of ages for two major pre-Holocene phases of forest expansion recorded in the sequence, with implications for the timing of periods of high effective precipitation in the region. The new UTD ages indicate that the oldest forest phase falls within the Penultimate Interglacial whereas the later phase corresponds with the Last Interglacial. This is older than indicated by previously reported UTD and radiocarbon dates, but confirms a chronology based on direct correlation with the pollen record from marine core E55-6. The new chronology of the Lake Wangoom sequence provides evidence that phases of sustained forest development in southeast Australia relate to interglacial periods. In comparison, interstadial periods appear to be characterised by only minor arboreal development. Marked differences in the pattern of vegetation development evident in each of the interglacials are thought to reflect varying climatic and anthropogenic influences.

J	Meadows, J; Zunde, M				Meadows, John; Zunde, Maris			A lake fortress, a floating chronology, and an atmospheric anomaly: the surprising results of a radiocarbon wiggle-match from Araisi, Latvia	GEOCHRONOMETRIA												An Iron Age timber settlement which, in view of the defensive structures uncovered, is described as a lake fortress, on an island in Lake AEuroraii, north-eastern Latvia, was excavated in 1965-69 and 1975-79 by teams led by JAnis Apals, who distinguished five construction phases. Dendrochronological analysis produced a c. 100-year floating chronology for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) timbers from the earliest phase. A C-14 wiggle-match was undertaken to obtain an absolute date range for the final year of the floating chronology, and thus for the construction of the settlement. Ten blocks of wood from one timber, each comprising 6-11 years and collectively spanning the whole 93-year tree-ring series, were dated by AMS. Using the IntCal13 calibration data, there is a 95% probability that the felling date of this timber falls in the range 775-784 cal AD. It appears, however, that the AD 775 spike in the atmospheric C-14 level occurred within the 6-year span of the last sample. On this basis, we can narrow the date of construction to 776-780 cal AD. This date is significantly earlier than those reported in previous publications.					; Meadows, John/AAU-2326-2020; Zunde, Māris/CAJ-4977-2022	Meadows, John/0000-0002-4346-5591; Zunde, Maris/0000-0001-7068-7627													1897-1695					SEP	2014	41	3					223	233		10.2478/s13386-013-0153-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13386-013-0153-2													WOS:000338330700005
J	Wang, LC				Wang, Liang-Chi			Subtropical montane vegetation dynamics in response to Holocene climate change in central Taiwan	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is a key component of the global monsoon system, with significant impacts on the climate and ecosystems in Taiwan. However, information about its impact on vegetation diversity during the Holocene in Taiwan and high resolution climate records are unclear and absent. The pollen, charcoal and diatom records from Tien pond are used to provide records with a multidecadal resolution of vegetation changes, fire frequency and hydrological conditions, reflecting the pattern of monsoon intensity and its relationship with subtropical forest ecosystems during the last 8,500 years cal bp. Past temperatures inferred from the percentage of upper montane forest (UMF) taxa and PC2 of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated records of the warm Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) during the period 7,000-2,860 cal bp. Past precipitation inferred from diatom concentration and PC1 of PCA showed reduced monsoon precipitation during the thermal maximum. This appears to be the opposite of the pattern in northern China, where the precipitation decreased toward the late Holocene. The positive correlation between the palynological richness index (PRI) and arboreal pollen percentages highlighted the importance of forest canopy cover in driving forest diversity. The high richness in the warm/dry HTM suggests that subtropical montane forests support rich biodiversity and can serve as refugia for taxa during climate fluctuations. These results have implications for conserving and managing subtropical forest ecosystems under future climate change scenarios.

J	Ballantyne, CK				Ballantyne, Colin K.			Loch Lomond Stadial glaciers in the Uig Hills, western Lewis, Scotland	SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Geomorphological mapping of the Uig Hills provides evidence for four locally-nourished valley glaciers with a total area of 11.69 km(2). A Loch Lomond Stadial (-12.9-11.5 ka BP) age for this glacial episode is indicated by the radial configuration of reconstructed glaciers, the landform assemblage and the absence of frost-weathered rock inside its limits. Recessional moraines extend upvalley from former glacier termini, implying that glacier retreat was driven by gradual climatic forcing. The mean equilibrium line altitude ( ELA) of the glaciers is calculated as 212 m, consistent with a northwards ELA decrease along the western seaboard of Great Britain of 68.5 m/ 100 km, equivalent to a latitudinal summer temperature gradient of -0.41 degrees C/100 km. A mean July sea-level temperature of -7.1 degrees C is inferred for the coldest part of the stade. Average accumulation at the ELA is estimated to have been 2585 +/- 200 mm, much of which probably comprised snow blown from adjacent ground.																			1470-2541	1751-665X					2007	122	4					256	273																WOS:000246884200002

We tested the influence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and shallow stratification on phytoplankton and bacterioplankton from the surface and the base of the mixed layer in two boreal lakes in north-western Ontario, Canada. 2. We measured phytoplankton biomass and production, bacterioplankton production and plankton respiration after transplantation under three solar radiation treatments: ambient radiation ( Photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR) + ultraviolet-A (UVA) + ultraviolet-B (UVB)), minus UVB ( PAR + UVA) and PAR only. We repeated this experiment on three occasions in each lake during the summer. 3. Solar stress ( measured as reduced growth and photoinhibition) was generally only found in the 'base phytoplankton' (i.e. originating from the base of the mixed layer). No inhibition of photosynthesis by UVB exposure was found in near-surface phytoplankton. On the other hand, production of near-surface bacterioplankton was reduced following a 4-h UVR exposure but had increased after a 48-h exposure to both UVA and UVB compared with the PAR only treatment. 4. Negative effects of UVR on phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were not ubiquitous. We emphasise the importance of conducting experiments repeatedly, particularly those which test the effects of UVR on different community assemblages from different lakes.

In a study of Genggahai Lake in the Gonghe Basin, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, we used accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS C-14) dating to determine the age of (1) dissolved inorganic carbon in the water (DICLW), (2) macrophyte remains in the uppermost samples of core sediments, (3) living P. pectinatus in the lake, and (4) dissolved inorganic carbon of spring water in the catchment. The results show that the ages of the DICLW (910 C-14 yr BP on average) were much younger than the ages of the groundwater (6330 C-14 yr BP on average), which may result mainly from CO2 exchange between the lake water and the atmosphere. In addition, the C-14 ages of DICLW and macrophyte remains in the uppermost core sediments varied from site to site within the lake, which we ascribe to the different photosynthesis rates of Chara spp. and vascular plants. The higher photosynthesis rate of Chara spp. decreases lake-water pCO(2), which leads to more atmospheric CO2 being absorbed by the lake water, and thereby greatly reducing the age of carbon species in areas dominated by Chara spp. Although Genggahai Lake is well mixed, the differences between the apparent ages of the lake water are significantly modulated by the photosynthesis intensity of submerged plants.

Three clone libraries were constructed from samples collected in the euphotic layers of the lakes during spring 2007. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined data from the three lakes clustered our sequences into thee divisions: Chytridiomycota (50% of total sequences), Ascomycota (40%) and Basidiomycota (10% in Pavin and Aydat only). Several sequences were assigned to a novel Chytridiomycota clade first recovered in Lake Pavin in 2005. Most of the sequences retrieved in the investigated lakes were affiliated with known fungal species, most of which were apparently well adapted to thrive in the pelagic realm. Their main functions (i.e. parasitism and saprophytism), putatively inferred from the closest relatives of the retrieved molecular sequences, were confirmed by microscopic approaches and by enrichment experiments with pollen grains. The occurrence of three fungal forms (zoosporic, yeast and mycelial) was associated with different trophic modes, establishing fungi as strong potential competitors for various niches in pelagic ecosystems, primarily in relation to the processing of particulate organic matter and the production of propagule food sources for grazers. For the first time, this study provides insight into the diversity and the associated functions of all members of the Kingdom Eumycota investigated in the whole plankton fraction of aquatic ecosystems.					; Cauchie, Henry-Michel/K-8123-2014; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Cauchie, Henry-Michel/0000-0003-4780-6100; Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				SEP	2012	14	9			SI		2480	2494		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02771.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02771.x								22568577					WOS:000308300600019

Intra- and inter-field compositional changes of oils from the Misoa B4 reservoir in the Ceuta Southeast Area (Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela)	FUEL												Here we analyzed oil samples from 35 wells in the Ceuta Southeast Area (Lake Maracaibo Basin, northwestern Venezuela) in order to evaluate lateral intra-reservoir continuity in the Misoa B4 unit. Biomarkers, isotopic signature, and also V and Ni were examined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), and inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Multivariate statistical analysis was also applied to obtain useful information from geochemical data. On the basis of the characterization of these samples, we conclude that they all fall into various oil families derived from two pulses of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation from the calcareous La Luna source rock, deposited in an anoxic marine environment under reducing conditions. Thus, these oils are a mixture of an earlier biodegraded, less mature oil charge and a later fresh non-biodegraded oil recharge. In addition, we applied asphaltene pyrolysis to one (LG-62) of the three "anomalous" oils. The LG-62 sample was confirmed as an almost "pure" paleobiodegraded endmember, whereas the VLF-3020 oil was tentatively classified as the unaltered end-member oil-type. Finally, the GC fingerprints and Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopic indices of the oils were used to detect minor variations in composition that are indicative of reservoir compartmentalization.

William			TAXONOMY, PALEOECOLOGY AND BIOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE LATE NEOPROTEROZOIC CHICHKAN MICROBIOTA OF SOUTH KAZAKHSTAN: THE MARINE BIOSPHERE ON THE EVE OF METAZOAN RADIATION	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												Carbonaceous bedded cherts of the late Neoproterozoic (Cryogenian) similar to 800 to 750 Ma old Chichkan Formation of South Kazakhstan contain an abundant, diverse assemblage of exquisitely preserved microorganisms. Like many Proterozoic microbiotas, the Chichkan assemblage is dominated by prokaryotic cyanobacteria, both filamentous (oscillatorialeans and nostocaleans, represented primarily by cellular trichomes and empty sheaths) and coccoidal (chroococcaleans and pleurocapsaleans, including solitary, colonial, and stalk-forming specimens). However, unlike Proterozoic microbiotas reported from peritidal settings, the Chichkan fossils, permineralized in cherts deposited in the open shelf facies of the formation, include diverse microscopic eukaryotes: vase-shaped testate amoebae, spiny (acanthomorphic) phytoplanktonic unicells, large (up to similar to 1 mm diameter.) megasphaeromorphic acritarchs, and sausage-shaped vaucheriacean green alga-like filaments. Given the composition of this biota and the presence in it and similarly aged assemblages of numerous taxa typical of late Neoproterozoic deposits (e.g., Cerebrosphaera, Jacutianema, Melanocyrillium, Stictosphaeridium, Trachyhy-strichosphaera, and Vandalosphaeridium), the Chichkan Lagerstatte appears representative of the Cryogenian biota as now known, thereby documenting the status of the marine biosphere at a time closely preceding the radiation of the Metazoa. As such, we interpret this and other coeval mixed assemblages of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microfossils as representing an evolutionary stage transitional between the predominantly prokaryote-dominated Precambrian and the eukaryote-dominated Phanerozoic biospheres. As reported here, the Chichkan assemblage is composed of 39 taxa (of which two forms are described informally) that are assigned to 23 genera of microscopic prokaryotes and eukaryotes and that include two new species: Polybessurus crassus n. sp. and Vandalosphaeridium koksuicum n. sp.																			0022-3360	1937-2337				MAY	2010	84	3					363	401		10.1666/09-133.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/09-133.1													WOS:000277664500001

Coexisting Forms of Vanadium in Surface Water Objects (Review)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The results of studies of the vanadium content and its coexisting forms in surface water bodies of various regions have been summarized. It has been shown that vanadium concentration in uncontaminated water bodies and rivers does not exceed several g/L, whereas its concentration in water bodies which are subject to anthropogenic influence or located in the regions of volcanic activity reaches tens to hundreds of g/L. The ratio of the suspended and dissolved forms of vanadium has been considered. The dissolved form of vanadium generally predominates in water bodies, whereas its migration as a constituent of suspended substances is characteristic of rivers, especially during the spring period. The studies of dissolved vanadium compounds concerning the ratio of its oxidized and reduced forms as well as complexation with dissolved organic matter have been discussed. It has been shown that V(V) dominates in the form of the H2VO4- anion as the most stable form under oxidative conditions of surface waters. Several studies have noted the predominance of V(IV) in the form of oxocation VO2+, although it is known as unstable in the natural aquatic environment and is rapidly oxidized to V(V). This process is decelerated in the presence of humic substances which exhibit reducing properties. Anionic, cationic and neutral complexes of vanadium with organic ligands are known. Humic substances play a major part in the complexation as established for certain water bodies of Ukraine. The results of studies on the molecular weight distribution of vanadium complex compounds have been also considered.					; Linnik, Rostyslav/F-5593-2017; Linnik, Peter/S-5725-2019	Linnik, Rostyslav/0000-0002-6401-8184; Linnik, Peter/0000-0002-2144-4052; 													1070-3632	1608-3350				DEC	2018	88	13					2997	3007		10.1134/S1070363218130273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1070363218130273													WOS:000462934200027

AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Day and night acoustic surveys were used to compare fish stock estimates at eight European reservoirs and one flooded mining pit. During both photoperiods of summer, higher fish biomass was observed in the uppermost 4 m of the water column by horizontal beaming than in deeper water by vertical beaming. Comparisons of volume backscattering coefficient (S(v)), fish biomass (kg ha(-1)), abundance (ind. ha(-1)) and average fish weight (g) did not show a common pattern among the reservoirs but were found to vary significantly across photoperiods. At most reservoirs, the night surveys had higher estimates than day surveys. However, at several reservoirs the opposite pattern was observed. These patterns could not be explained by the species composition of the fish stocks. Fish size distributions were found to be different between day and night. A higher proportion of 1+ and older fish were found during the night at two of three studied waterbodies. In general, it was not possible to decide whether day or night acoustic surveys gave more reliable fish stock assessments. We advise performing both day and night transects on a given water body before deciding when to conduct the full survey. For a complete fish assessment it is very desirable to combine acoustic mobile surveys with active sampling gear.					; Prchalová, Marie/F-8664-2014; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Frouzova, Jaroslava/F-8518-2014; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014; Riha, Milan/G-1065-2014; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Prchalova, Marie/F-8664-2014; Juza, Tomas/G-3159-2014; Mrkvicka, Tomas/D-7173-2016; Tušer, Michal/F-8548-2014; Matena, Josef/F-8254-2014; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014	Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Tuser, Michal/0000-0003-2881-392X; Riha, Milan/0000-0002-3930-420X; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Prchalova, Marie/0000-0001-5000-2918; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977													0990-7440					JAN-MAR	2009	22	1					69	77		10.1051/alr/2009013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/2009013													WOS:000265079800008

In spite of the extensive research on the group and its ecological and conservational relevance, scarce information is available on Mediterranean environments, especially rivers and small water reservoirs, where charophytes face challenging summer droughts and changes in hydrological regimes, as well as pervasive anthropogenic pressures. This research aimed, through repeated field observations, detailed analyses of population traits, and extensive characterization of the colonized environments, to foster an understanding of the distribution, biodiversity, and ecology of charophytes in an area of exceptional environmental value and that is still uninvestigated in relation to its charophyte flora, the southern Campania region (Italy). Overall, 17 populations were discovered, belonging to 4 taxa of the Chara genus: C. globularis, C. gymnophylla, C. vulgaris, and C. vulgaris var. papillata, reduced to 12 populations and to the first 3 taxa by the end of the study. The species occupied different ecological niches and colonized environments such as rivers and small ponds, with environment-dependent morphotypes. The occurrence of few taxa with a wide distribution, often forming ephemeral populations, suggests ongoing constraints on charophyte biodiversity in the area, favoring opportunistic species that are able to benefit from temporary refugia.

By February, they formed a scattering layer between depths of 12 to 24 m during the day, where they achieved a maximum density of 0.59 fish m(-3). Larger (> 18mm) fish migrated to the littoral zone and densities declined to < 0.01 fish m(-3) by July, when remaining larval fish occupied greater daytime depths. Their vertical distribution during the day appeared to be influenced mainly by light levels and water temperatures. Larvae grew more slowly (0.12 mm d(-1)) than in more productive North Island lakes, and were also present in lower densities for a more restricted period of time. Koaro larvae first appeared in November and December and were found in low numbers (< 0.01 fish m(-3)) in summer at depths of 10 to 26 m. Salmonid production in the limnetic zone is probably limited by the small size and relative scarcity of forage fish present.																			0018-8158					MAR	2000	421						41	46		10.1023/A:1003965116777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003965116777													WOS:000086541800004

A Top-to-Bottom Luminescence-Based Chronology for the Post-LGM Regression of a Great Basin Pluvial Lake	QUATERNARY												We applied luminescence dating to a suite of shorelines constructed by pluvial Lake Clover in northeastern Nevada, USA during the last glacial cycle. At its maximum extent, the lake covered 740 km(2) with a mean depth of 16 m and a water volume of 13 km(3). In the north-central sector of the lake basin, 10 obvious beach ridges extend from the highstand to the lowest shoreline over a horizontal distance of similar to 1.5 km, representing a lake area decrease of 35%. These ridges are primarily composed of sandy gravel and rise similar to 1.0 m above the alluvial fan surface on which they are superposed. Single grain luminescence dating of K-feldspar using the pIRIR SAR (post-infrared infrared single-aliquot regenerative dose) protocol, corroborated by SAR dating of quartz, indicates that the highstand shoreline was constructed ca. 16-17 ka during Heinrich Stadial I (Greenland Stadial 2, GS-2), matching C-14 age control for this shoreline elsewhere in the basin. The lake regressed rapidly during the Bolling/Allerod (GI-1), before the rate of regression slowed during the Younger Dryas interval (GS-1). The lowest shoreline was constructed ca. 10 ka. Persistence of Lake Clover into the early Holocene may reflect enhanced monsoonal precipitation driven by the summer insolation maximum.					; landis, joshua/AHD-7599-2022	landis, joshua/0000-0002-3039-7841; Walcott, Caleb Kazunari/0000-0003-4754-9466													2571-550X					JUN	2020	3	2							11	10.3390/quat3020011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat3020011													WOS:000551267300006

Comprehensive multi-technique approach reveals the high diversity of microcystins in field collections and an associated isolate of Microcystis aeruginosa from a Turkish lake	TOXICON												Microcystins (MCs) are hepatotoxic and potentially carcinogenic cyanotoxins. They exhibit high structural variability, with nearly 250 variants described to date. This variability can result in incomplete detection of MC variants during lake surveys due to the frequent use of targeted analytical methods and a lack of standards available for identification and quantitation. In this study, Lake Uluabat in Turkey was sampled during the summer of 2015. Phylogenetic analysis of the environmental mcyA sequences suggested Microcystis spp. were the major MC contributors. A combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), liquid chromatography with UV detection and mass spectrometry (LC-UV-MS), and a novel liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) method, together with thiol and periodate reactivity, revealed more than 36 MC variants in the lake samples and a strain of M. aeruginosa (AQUAMEB-24) isolated from Lake Uluabat. Only MCs containing arginine at position-4 were detected in the culture, while MC-LA, -LY, -LW and -LF were also detected in the lake samples, suggesting the presence of other MC producers in the lake. The previously unreported MCs MC-(H2)YR (dihydrotyrosine at position-2) (17), [epoxyAdda(5)]MC-LR, [DMAdda(5)]MC-RR (1) and [Mser(7)]MC-RR (8) were detected in the culture and/or field samples. This study is a good example of how commonly used targeted LC-MS methods can underestimate the diversity of MCs in freshwater lakes and cyanobacteria cultures and how untargeted LC-MS methods can be used to comprehensively assess MC diversity present in a new system.					özen, Mihriban/GVS-4138-2022; Balci, Muharrem/V-9411-2017; Demir, Nilsun/H-7762-2012; Beach, Daniel/A-8286-2013; Yilmaz, Mete/AAB-3685-2021; BALCI, Muharrem/V-9411-2017	Yilmaz, Mete/0000-0002-0982-727X; Beach, Daniel/0000-0002-5680-2112; Foss, Amanda/0000-0003-0412-3879; Demir, Nilsun/0000-0002-3895-7655; BALCI, Muharrem/0000-0001-9373-6647; Miles, Christopher Owen/0000-0001-8537-4439													0041-0101	1879-3150				SEP	2019	167						87	100		10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.06.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.06.006								31181296					WOS:000482248000012

The catchment area (60 km2) is composed of leucitic undersaturated volcanic rocks, mainly of the pyroclastic type. The lithostratigraphic sequence can be summarized as consisting of two alternating lithotypes, which allows different palaeoclimatic influences to be drawn: the first consists mainly of tuffaceous silts, generally enriched with organic matter and aceolian quartz, and contains heavy and weathered minerals. It is interpreted as a sediment deposited with a predominantly terrigenous supply by the abundant surface waters flowing into the lake during wet climatic phases. The second lithotype consists of silts with a predominantly carbonate component, rich in mollusc shells but with low contents of organic matter, aeolian quartz, heavy and weathering minerals. It is interpreted as a sediment deposited during relatively dry climatic phases with an abundant calcium bicarbonate supply, which is relatively higher than the terrigenous one. Most of the sequence can be correlated with the palaeoclimatic variations inferred from oxygen isotopic stratigraphy. Dry intervals seem to be related to the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere when the earth is at perihelion.																			0277-3791						1992	11	3					353	362		10.1016/0277-3791(92)90006-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(92)90006-T													WOS:A1992HP40000006
J	HERRMANN, SJ				HERRMANN, SJ			ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURE OF 4 LENTIC COMMUNITIES ON COLORADO (USA) SHORTGRASS PRAIRIE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Four natural lentic habitats on the Central Plains Experimental Range in Colorado were intensively studied physically, chemically and biologically for 2 yr (1968-1970) and intermittently for 5 (1971-1975). Lynn Lake and Lake George were chosen as examples of ephemeral or temporary sites; Cottonwood Pond and Spring Pond were chosen as permanent habitats. Chemically, the waters of each site were analytically separated into dissolved and suspended (sestonic) components. The temporary sites were characterized by their exceptionally high seston loads, the presence of Eubranchiopoda, the prevalence of Ca as the major dissolved cation and the high Fe contents of their sediments. The 2 permanent sites had high total dissolved salt content, rich and varied flora and fauna, Na as the prevalent cation in the dissolved fraction and high Ca contents in the sediments. All 4 sites were seston digesters with large amounts of wind-blown organic material being entrapped, decomposed and mineralized. By comparison with adjacent soils the sediments of all 4 basins were much richer in K, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn. Temporary and permanent sites function as nutrient sinks. Rates of daily and annual phytoplankton primary productivity are reported for the 2 permanent sites.																			0020-9309						1977	62	6					729	764		10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.1977.3510620602													WOS:A1977EK91300002
J	Bourke, P; Magnan, P; Rodriguez, MA				Bourke, P; Magnan, P; Rodriguez, MA			Individual variations in habitat use and morphology in brook charr	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The specific objectives of this study were to determine if there is individual specialization in habitat use by lacustrine brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis and if so, if specialization is related to fish morphology. Localizations of 28 brook charr equipped with thermosensitive radio-transmitters were recorded during three summers (1991, 1992, and 1993) in two lakes of the Mastigouche Reserve (Quebec, Canada). Fifty per cent of the fish were found mainly in the benthic zone (hereafter benthic individuals), 18% in the pelagic zone (pelagic individuals), and 32% travelled regularly between the two zones (generalist individuals). The observed interindividual differences in habitat preference were related to differences in body morphology and coloration: (i) the pectoral fins of benthic and generalist individuals were significantly longer than those of pelagic ones; and (ii) the coloration of the lower flank of benthic and generalist individuals was silver-grey while that of pelagic individuals was red. The results of this study suggest that brook charr inhabiting oligotrophic lakes of the Canadian Shield exhibit trophic polymorphisms, where some individuals are specialists better adapted to feeding in the littoral zone whereas others are specialists better adapted to feeding in the pelagic zone. The potential for reproductive isolation between the two morphs is discussed. (C) 1997 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH												Tipping points of about 16 elements have been identified in Earth system, yet cryospheric tipping point of specific Alpine region has not been studied. Here we analyzed three tipping elements (mountain glacier, snow cover, and permafrost) identified in recent years, evidenced by the facts of frequent occurrence of abrupt massive collapse of glacier mass and the widespread thermakarst of permafrost. Since 2015, strikingly abrupt cryosphere events (ACEs) have been consistently observed over a large range of High Mountain Asia (HMA). Those events were unprecedentedly significant in history, leading to collapses of glaciers following by disconnection of glacier tongue from accumulation basin and recession of thermakarst towards higher elevation. Strong decreasing of snow depth in 2022 was also observed since 2021/2022 winter, coinciding with extreme warming of the year. The widespread high warming rates in the last two decades over HMA might have triggered above ACEs. The dynamic thresholds of ACEs depend largely on high temperature, especially extreme heat wave, for both glaciers and permafrost, closely related to meltwater as a key factor for reaching initial conditions of abrupt changes, suggesting HMA cryosphere is a tipping element under the global warming level of 1.1 degrees C. The ACEs can cause tremendous damage to local ecosystem and socioeconomy, measures to mitigate risks should be taken when the tipping points are reached.

Hasseldala-a key site for Last Termination climate events in northern Europe	BOREAS												The Last Termination (19 000-11 000 a BP) with its rapid and distinct climate shifts provides a perfect laboratory to study the nature and regional impact of climate variability. The sedimentary succession from the ancient lake at Hasseldala Port in southern Sweden with its distinct Lateglacial/early Holocene stratigraphy (> 14.1-9.5 cal. ka BP) is one of the few chronologically well-constrained, multi- proxy sites in Europe that capture a variety of local and regional climatic and environmental signals. Here we present Hasseldala's multi-proxy records (lithology, geochemistry, pollen, diatoms, chironomids, biomarkers, hydrogen isotopes) in a refined age model and place the observed changes in lake status, catchment vegetation, summer temperatures and hydroclimate in a wider regional context. Reconstructed mean July temperatures increased between c. 14.1 and c. 13.1 cal. ka BP and subsequently declined. This latter cooling coincided with drier hydroclimatic conditions that were probably associated with a freshening of the Nordic Seas and started a few hundred years before the onset of Greenland Stadial 1 (c. 12.9 cal. ka BP). Our proxies suggest a further shift towards colder and drier conditions as late as c. 12.7 cal. ka BP, which was followed by the establishment of a stadial climate regime (c. 12.5-11.8 cal. ka BP). The onset of warmer and wetter conditions preceded the Holocene warming over Greenland by c. 200 years. Hasseldala's proxies thus highlight the complexity of environmental and hydrological responses across abrupt climate transitions in northern Europe.

Characterization of bulk and chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the Laurentian Great Lakes during summer 2013	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes contain similar to 21% of the Earth's surface freshwater and are experiencing dramatic decadal-scale changes to their water quality, biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions We report here the first data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM), including UV-visible absorbance and derived optical properties and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), for open-lakesurface waters from each of the Great Lakes. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 86 to 240 mu mol/L and the absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)) varied from 2.67 to 10.47 m(-1) in Great Lakes waters. UV-visible and fluorescence characterization indicated that the DOM in open-lake waters in all the Great Lakes was primarily autochthonous. Both DOC and a(254) increased from Lake Superior to Lakes Erie and Ontario where aromaticity, molecular weight and humification degree of DOM were also higher. These variations are consistent with both the water transport pathway and the trend of increasing human population and relative watershed drainage area along the Great Lakes. Parallel factor analysis on fluorescence-EEM data revealed three terrestrial humic-likeDOM components (C1, C2 and C4) and one protein-likeDOM component (C3). Open Lake Huron had the highest protein-like/humic-like DOM ratio (C3/C1), while sites in Lakes Erie and Ontario had lower C3/C1 ratios, indicating a greater proportional influence of terrestrial DOM. Changes in DOM composition along the water transport pathway in the Great Lakes indicate varying impacts from terrestrial inputs and human activities in the different lake systems.

Rigorous monitoring of the effects of stocking is less common, however, and possible negative impacts of stocking on the target population are rarely considered, even though supportive stocking might exert a series of negative effects. The present study discusses these potential impacts, taking Upper Lake Constance whitefish as an example. In 2003, a proportion of the larvae stocked into the lake were labelled with Alizarin Red S. The contribution made by stocking to virtual cohort size was estimated at 83%. Survival rates from egg or larval stages to adulthood for naturally produced fish and those incubated in hatcheries in 2003 were compared with those estimated from records pertaining to the cohorts of 1925-1939. Survival rates for lake-hatched larvae in 2003 fell between 1 and 10% of historic values. Several factors that may have contributed to this decline are discussed, of which the most potent seems to be the massive stocking of the lake with delayed hatchery larvae. Continued successful stocking will increase the contribution to the population of fish with partial or complete hatchery ancestry, and it may compromise the stock's ability to adapt to a changing environment through natural selection.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						325	336																WOS:000313086600022

The Vico caldera and the lake of the same name form the central nucleus of a Nature Reserve and are an important source of drinkable water for a number of municipalities. The main aim of the study was to improve our knowledge of the hydrogeological setting of the system in order to quantify the groundwater resource and to examine the interaction between the groundwater and Lake Vico in their specific geological framework. The hydrogeological investigations included: i) reconstruction of. local hydrostratigraphy; ii) collection of data from wells and springs; iii) flow measurement of streams; iv) development of some pumping tests; v) analysis of climatic data. The volcanic aquifer consists primarily of Pleistocene pyroclastic deposits (tuffs, ignimbrites, ashes, pumice and scoriae) and various lava flows and domes. Its base and part of its SW and NE boundaries are well defined by low-permeability rocks, including sandy-clayey deposits (Pliocene-Pleistocene) and marly-calcareous flysch (Upper Cretaceous-Oligocene). The remaining boundaries are formed by highly permeable Quaternary alluvial and sandy-conglomeratic deposits. The groundwater flow occurs mainly through the unconfined basal volcanic aquifer and to a lesser extent through various perched aquifers. The basal volcanic aquifer has a centrifugal radial flow network; the roundwater discharges primarily into streams (not less than 1.4 Us) and in part into small springs (less than 0.5 m(3)/S). The volcanic aquifer also feeds the aquifer of the surrounding plain, especially where the Quaternary sandy-conglomeratic deposits flank the volcanic hills (about 2 m3/S). The pumping test data were correlated with the equipotential surface of the unconfined basal aquifer to define diverse transmissivity zones. The resulting wide range of transmissivity values obtained (between 10(-6) and 10(-2) m(2)/S) are in agreement with the heterogeneity of the volcanic products and with the variability of the saturated thickness. An average annual evaluation of groundwater resources points to a volume between 162 and 227 x 10(6) m(3)/year. Taking the area of the volcanic system into account, the mean yield of the aquifer amounts to between 5.7 and 8.0 l/s per km(2), consistent with other Tyrrhenian volcanic areas. The analysis of the historical hydro-meteorological data set indicates that precipitation follows a negative trend i.e. there is a progressive decline of groundwater resources. In this hydrogeological environment, Lake Vico is closely conditioned by the groundwater, being fed by the basal aquifer on its northern side (about 6% of the total inflow) and drained from the other sides (between 26 and 37% of the total outflow). According to the mean water budget of the lake, in addition to the amounts of water taken from the lake, the surface-groundwater exchange has a considerable effect on the reservoir resources. These factors can influence heavily the level of the lake, artificially regulated by a gated outlet which is not always managed according to a rational strategy of conjunctive use of water resources.					; Dragoni, Walter/AAG-2564-2019	Lotti, Francesca/0000-0003-2145-8398; 													0037-8763						2006	125	2					187	202																WOS:000239102600004

The influence of the natural UVR on phytoplankton dynamics was investigated in a small mesohumic lake, Lac Cromwell, in the Laurentian Hills by means of a time-intensive (about 60 days) daily study of the relationship between UVR flux and phytoplankton biomass. Following the onset of lake stratification, at which time the epilimnion became shallower than 2.5 m, the study revealed a strong negative relationship between ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) and algal biomass at the surface (r(2) = 0.61) and at 1 m (r(2) = 0.38). Although this relationship held throughout the stratified period, chlorophyll a concentration declined particularly rapidly (-65%) during a short-lived ozone-thinning period. There was a major shift in the community taxonomic composition during the same period from a typical diatom-chrysophyte spring bloom towards a dinoflagellate-dominated community that was followed by cyanobacteria. Here, we present evidence that the impact of the temporary increase in UVB was intensified by a concurrent lack of mixing, indicating that turbulence and thermal stratification are key components modulating UVB effects in lakes.

Aeration, clay, and cement treatments were compared with control. Representing the lake hypolimnion, microcosms were maintained under dark conditions at 9 +/- 1 degrees C for six months. For the initial six weeks, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in clay, cement and control microcosms was 5-6 mg/L. The DO in the aerated microcosms was 10-11 mg/L. After six weeks, the DO concentration was reduced by nitrogen purging to 0-2 mg/L in all microcosms except the aerated one. All treatment microcosms demonstrated significantly lower water column iron concentrations. The rate and extent of iron release from lake sediments to water was influenced by mechanisms involving oxidation and sorption processes. Of the treatments, aeration and clay appeared to be effective in capturing iron released from sediments. Cement treatment caused high pH (10-11), high ammonia concentration (2.5 mg-N/L), and depressed bacterial density. Although efficient at capturing iron, cement treatment would not constitute a realistic environmental application because of unacceptable pH shifts in the water column.																			1077-1204						1994	29	7					1491	1506		10.1080/10934529409376124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529409376124													WOS:A1994NZ16200017
J	PULLIAM, WM				PULLIAM, WM			CARBON-DIOXIDE AND METHANE EXPORTS FROM A SOUTHEASTERN FLOODPLAIN SWAMP	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Patterns and rates of generation of CO2 and CH4 by aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration are a significant gap in knowledge of floodplain carbon dynamics. Gaseous and hydrologic exports of CO2 and CH4 from the forested floodplain of the Ogeechee River in Georgia, USA, were studied from July 1987 to September 1989. Net emissions to the atmosphere were measured with short(10-20 min) static chamber incubations. CO2 emissions were highly seasonal, with largest rates during summer, and were strongly correlated with soil temperatures. Annual total CO2 emissions were similar in both years of the study, and averaged 919 g/m(2). The contribution of live root respiration to this total was estimated with in situ incubations of attached roots excavated from the soil. Over 55% of the total CO2 flux appeared to arise from live roots rather than mineralization of soil organic matter. Significant atmospheric CH4 fluxes were found only at flooded sites. CH4 emissions were highly variable, with high rates of release of methane carbon (up to 271 mg.m(-2).d(-1)) occurring irregularly during the warmer months. The temperature effect on CH4 emissions appeared to be a step function. No significant CH4 emissions occurred when soil temperatures were below 15 degrees C; during warmer periods emission rates were generally positive, but showed no additional correlation with temperature. This effect is hypothesized to represent an interaction of the rates of oxygen consumption and replenishment in the soil. Spatial variability in CH4 emissions was also large. Over 90% of the total floodplain CH4 emissions came from the 30% of the floodplain that was most frequently inundated. Annual total fluxes of CH4 carbon from low habitats averaged 17 g.m(-2).yr(-1). Methane oxidation rates were estimated in floodplain surface waters by in situ bottle incubations. Roughly half of the CH4 that entered the water column was consumed without reaching the atmosphere.																			0012-9615					FEB	1993	63	1					29	53		10.2307/2937122	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937122													WOS:A1993MN18500002

Contested interpretations of the estuary's limnological history and uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of current basin water usage practice warrant a robust investigation into how the system has evolved. Here we combine lithostratigraphic, geochemical and sedimentological evidence from a transect of sediment cores to reconstruct the sediment infill history of the system. We uncover multiple stages of sediment infill over the history of the system, associated with (1) the low gradient morphology of the estuary and lower river channel, (2) the mid- to late-Holocene sea-level regression and (3) anthropogenic modifications to the fluvio-estuarine system. We show that while estuarine conditions in the system were fully established during the mid-Holocene highstand (~6.4 kyr BP), central basin facies sedimentation was focussed further inland before prograding with the lowering of base level and shifting of tidal influence as sea-level fell. Central basin facies sedimentation within northern Lake Albert occurred from 5.4 to 4.0 cal kyr BP at ~0.25 cm yr(-1). The uppermost accumulation of this unit was eroded by continued reduction in base level until sea-level regression concluded at 3.5 cal kyr BP. Barrage and weir installation (1940 CE) re-initiated and expanded central basin facies sedimentation in the estuary (~0.32 cm yr(-1)). Recently deposited sediments exhibit geochemical markers of increased trophy and more frequent acid sulfate soil acidification, exposing human impacts on the estuary.

J	MARSH, P; HEY, M				MARSH, P; HEY, M			ANALYSIS OF SPRING HIGH WATER EVENTS IN THE MACKENZIE DELTA AND IMPLICATIONS FOR LAKE AND TERRESTRIAL FLOODING	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												This paper utilizes the partial duration series technique to quantify the flooding regime of high-closure lakes, a typical terrestrial portion of the delta plain, and channel levees in the east-central Mackenzie Delta. This analysis demonstrates that the lowest high-closure lakes are flooded annually to depths of up to 4 m, and for durations of up to 30 days. The highest lakes, however, do not flood annually and have much smaller magnitudes and durations. Since the delta plain is at a higher elevation than the lakes, the land is flooded less frequently and for shorter durations. In fact, much of the delta plain near Inuvik does not flood annually, and when it does flood, it is flooded by relatively shallow depths of water and for short duration. Channel levees in the study area vary greatly in elevation, with the lowest levees found on recently developed channels. They are inundated annually for long periods of time, while the highest elevation levees, found on older, established channels, are inundated infrequently and for short periods of time. Future work is required to relate variations in flooding to other factors such as sedimentation rates, nutrient cycling, and vegetation distributions. This would enable better predictions of the effect of environmental change on the Mackenzie Delta ecosystem.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					1994	76	4					221	234		10.2307/521082	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/521082													WOS:A1994QC64900002
J	Gulati, RD; van Donk, E				Gulati, RD; van Donk, E			Lakes in the Netherlands, their origin, eutrophication and restoration: state-of-the-art review	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This article starts with a brief description of the origin and eutrophication of shallow Dutch lakes, followed by a review of the various lake restoration techniques in use and the results obtained. Most freshwater lakes in the Netherlands are very shallow (< 2 m), and owe their origins to large-scale dredging and removal of peat during the early 17th century. They vary in area from a few hectares to a few thousand hectares, and are generally found in the northern and western part of the country. Most of them lie in the catchment areas of the major rivers: the Rhine, the Meuse and the Schelde. Because of their natural and aesthetic value, these lakes fulfil a recreational function. The lakes are important to the hydrology, water balance and agriculture in the surrounding polder country. The external input to the lakes of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and of polluted waters from the rivers and canals have been the major cause of eutrophication, which began during the 1950s. In addition, more recently climate changes, habitat fragmentation and biotic exploitation of many of these waters have probably led to loss of resilience and thus to accelerated eutrophication. Lake eutrophication is manifested essentially in the poor under-water light climate with high turbidity (Secchi-disc, 20-40 cm) caused usually by cyanobacterial blooms (e.g. Oscillatoria sp.), and loss of littoral vegetation. Despite recent perceptible reductions in external P inputs, non-point sources, especially of N from agriculture, still remain high and constitute a major challenge to the lake restorers. Lake recovery is also invariably afflicted by in-lake nutrient sources. These include P loading from the P-rich sediments, mineralization in the water and release by the foraging and metabolic activities of the abundant benthivorous and planktivorous fish, mainly bream (Abramis brama). A variety of restoration techniques have been employed in the Dutch lakes: hydrological management, reduction of P in the external loads, in-lake reduction or immobilisation of P, and complementary ecological management. This last involves biomanipulation, or the top-down control of the food web. Hydrological management has resulted in an improvement in the lake water quality only in a few cases. The failure of lake restoration measures (e. g. in the Loosdrecht lakes, described as a case study) has led water managers to use biomanipulation in other lakes under restoration. Lake biomanipulation principally involves reducing the existing planktivore population, bream in most cases, and introducing piscivores such as northern pike (Esox lucius). Lake Zwemlust is discussed as a case study, with brief mention of some other small lakes which have been biomanipulated. The restoration studies reveal that decrease of P to low levels is no guarantee that cyanobacterial populations will also follow suit. This is because cyanobacteria can withstand great variation in their P content and thus in their C: P ratios. Thus, for a unit weight of P, the Cyanobacteria can yield relatively more biomass and cause greater turbidity than, for example, green algae, which have relatively lower C: P ratios. This is possibly an explanation for the success of these filamentous Cyanobacteria in many Dutch lakes, and the failure of restoration endeavours. In addition, a falling trend in chlorophyll-a content in these shallow lakes does not set off an immediate increase in lake transparency because of resuspension of seston and inorganic suspended matter from the lake bottom by both wind-induced waves and fish foraging activity. The zooplankton-grazing peak in spring, caused usually by large-bodied grazers, Daphnia spp., is invariably the first step in bringing about a clear-water phase. Subsequently, summer light conditions trigger optimal growth conditions for macrophytes, which then maintain the high water clarity by competing successfully with phytoplankton for nutrients, especially N. The 'return' of macrophytes, especially stoneworts(Chara spp.) in some lakes, has contributed to the sustaining of improved light conditions and success of the restoration measures. In addition to competing with phytoplankton for nutrients, the macrophytes exert their positive influence in manifold ways. They act as a major nutrient sink, provide refuges for zooplankton and young pike and reduce wind- and fish-induced bioturbation of sediment. Most restoration accomplishments in recent years have been attributed to the success of aquatic macrovegetation. In general, the achievements of restoration work in the Dutch lakes, especially those using biomanipulation measures, are questionable: there are probably more examples of failures than of successes. The failures are generally linked not only to insufficient or no decrease at all in the autochthonous or in-lake nutrient loadings, but also to rapid increase of the planktivorous fish in the years following their reduction. A 75% reduction in the existing planktivore population has often been used as an arbitrary yardstick for effective reduction, but may not be sufficient. However, fish stock reductions to <50 kg FW ha(-1) and maintenance at that level might have a greater chance of success, though maintaining the existing fish population at preconceived levels is difficult since for reasons not yet fully understood, piscivores, pike in particular, fail to develop sizeable populations. Studies so far have helped us recognise that for sustainability of the positive effects on water quality, 'natural development' should be central to future lake restoration programmes. Future restoration plans typically visualise lakes as integral parts of their landscape, and envisage their 'nature development'. Such thinking aims at reinforcing the lakes' shoreline vegetation to prevent erosion and improve the subtlety of the land-water transition (e.g. Volkerak Zoommeer lake system). Where in-lake P stocks have retarded the pace of lake recovery (e.g. Loosdrecht Lakes), excavation of 20-30 m deep pits in shallower lake areas to allow wind- induced shifting of the nutrient-rich upper sediment layers and burial in the pits in order to hinder P releases from the sediments is now under way. For some lakes the creation of artificial islands to reduce the wind fetch factor and erosion has been planned; in other cases, more natural development of the quasi-aquatic ecosystems by water-level management in order to encourage the shoreline macrovegetation to develop has been planned. Such plans also have the provision of extending the upper and lower limits for permissible annual water-level fluctuations and exploring the effects of transient draw-downs. Ideally, near-natural water levels, unlike the current levels, are under consideration as possibly being the best option, also bearing climate change in mind. However, the consequences of flooding and recessions on the ecosystems and other water uses by man still need to be thoroughly investigated. In short, the experiences acquired from the failures and some successes of the last two decades should pave the way to development of more enduring strategies for sustainable restoration of our lake ecosystems.

Skrjabinoclava aculeata (Creplin, 1825) is regarded as a species inquirenda. S. decorata (Solonitzin, 1928) is regarded as the only other valid species in the genus. S. horrida, mainly a parasite of Scolopacidae and Charadriidae, is sporadic in other birds. It is rarely acquired by gulls on the wintering grounds but apparently not transmitted to gulls on their nesting grounds in Lake Ontario [North America]. S. horrida may not be able to utilize fish paratenic hosts and this could limit its establishment in piscivorous birds.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1983	61	2					339	348		10.1139/z83-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z83-044													WOS:A1983QH20700008
J	Kolzau, S; Dolman, AM; Voss, M; Wiedner, C				Kolzau, Sebastian; Dolman, Andrew M.; Voss, Maren; Wiedner, Claudia			The response of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria to a reduction in nitrogen loading	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Due to their competitive advantage when inorganic nitrogen (N) sources are scarce, it is widely assumed that the abundance and N-2-fixation rate of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (Nostocales) would increase in response to reduced N loading. If realized, this response would render efforts to improve water quality by N reduction ineffective. To assess this, we performed a microcosm experiment using water from an N limited lake, Langer See, in which phosphorus loading was held constant, while a gradient of decreasing N loading was simulated. Nostocales biovolume increased over time in all microcosms, regardless of the N addition rate, so that no difference in Nostocales biovolume developed between high and low N microcosms. In contrast, the biovolumes of other taxa (especially non-fixing cyanobacteria) were lower at low N addition rates. N-2-fixation increased in low N microcosms, compensating for 36% of the difference in N addition by day 6. However, this compensation rate was achieved at Nostocales biovolumes far higher than those typical in the studied lake. At biovolumes typical for summer the compensation rate would only account for 7% of the omitted N. If these results were to hold over longer time scales, in shallow polymictic lakes like Langer See, reduced N loading may lower both in-lake N concentrations and biovolumes of non-fixing phytoplankton without significantly impacting Nostocales biovolume.

The deep enclosures stratified in summer with an epilimnion and photic zone of the same depth as in the shallow, mixed, enclosures. The overall effect of nutrients and fish was the same in both shallow and deep enclosures. Nutrient enrichment caused phytoplankton productivity to increase about 10-fold both in the presence and absence of fish, but the presence of fish alone resulted in a 2-fold increase in total productivity in both nonfertilized and fertilized enclosures. Increases in maximal photosynthetic rates were not necessarily due to increases in algal biomass: chlorophyll-specific productivity increased in the presence of fish, reflecting in part changes in algal community structure. The relative contribution of picoplankton (0.2-2 mu m) decreased in the fertilized enclosures (5%) relative to controls (33%) whereas that of nanoplankton (2-20 mu m) increased with the addition of nutrients or fish, reaching almost 100% in the fertilized enclosures with fish added.

Polar lakes are the downwards integrator of the sediment action in their catchment areas. Bathymetric profiles of some proglacial, land-locked and epi-shelf lakes spread across the Schirmacher Oasis were obtained during the austral winter period of 2008 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to understand their evolution through space and time. Morphometric characteristics of these lakes show different depth ratios and they have different surface areas and volume proportions with depth. This study shows that the largest land-locked lake, L-49, appears to have been formed by the fusion of three sub-basins. Some of the proglacial lakes which are becoming detached from the polar ice sheet, such as lake P-11, are kettle lakes. Water from the polar ice-sheet melt has been accumulating at these lake basins, but no further aggradation processes have affected them. Some of the larger lakes such as lakes L-27, L-49 and P-9 are reworked lakes which evolved during a phase of glacial advancement and were later modified during another advancement phase. The other larger lakes such as lake E-14, E-15 and L-75 are very deep and were produced by the glacial activity associated with some weak structural fabric.																			0305-8719		978-1-78620-322-9				2018	461						77	93		10.1144/SP461.13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP461.13													WOS:000431852000007
J	Rooney, N; Kalff, J				Rooney, N; Kalff, J			Interactions among epilimnetic phosphorus, phytoplankton biomass and bacterioplankton metabolism in lakes of varying submerged macrophyte cover	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effect of submerged macrophytes on interactions among epilimnetic phosphorus, phytoplankton, and heterotrophic bacterioplankton has been acknowledged, but remains poorly understood. Here, we test the hypotheses that the mean summer phytoplankton biomass ( chlorophyll a): phosphorus ratios decrease with increased macrophyte cover in a series of nine lakes. Further, we test that both planktonic respiration and bacterioplankton production increase with respect to phytoplankton biomass along the same gradient of increasing macrophyte cover. Increased macrophyte cover was associated with a lower fraction of particulate phosphorus in epilimnia, with total particulate phosphorus declining from over 80% of total phosphorus in a macrophyte free lake to less than 50% in a macrophyte rich lake. Phytoplankton biomass ( chlorophyll a) too was lower in macrophyte dominated lakes, despite relatively high levels of total dissolved phosphorus. Planktonic respiration and bacterioplankton production were higher in macrophyte rich lakes than would be expected from phytoplankton biomass alone, pointing to a subsidy of bacterioplankton metabolism by macrophyte beds at the whole lake scale. The results suggest that the classical view of pelagic interactions, which proposes phosphorus determines phytoplankton abundance, which in turn determines bacterial abundance through the production of organic carbon, becomes less relevant as macrophyte cover increases.																			0018-8158					JUL	2003	501	1-3					75	81		10.1023/A:1026255302443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026255302443													WOS:000186041800008

We aimed to study the balance between primary and bacterial production in three shallow Andean lakes, in a summer sampling (high irradiance condition). Our hypothesis is that two factors would interact: high light and high DOM, affecting bacteria and algae. We carried out experiments of bacterial production (BP) by measuring [C-14]-l-leucine incorporation and PP by C-14 uptake in two fractions: picophytoplankton and phytoplankton > 2 mu m. Cell abundance, chlorophyll a, nutrients, DOM, light, and temperature were also measured. The contribution of picophytoplankton to total primary production (PP) was, in general, very high exceeding 50%. Picophytoplankton was photosynthetically more efficient than the larger autotrophs in all lakes. We observed a decrease in PP at surface levels due the high solar irradiances, while BP was not affected. Changes in the PP:BP ratios were observed in relation to DOM content and light effect. Our data indicate that the amount of available DOM drives the balance between PP and BP. However, solar radiation should be included as an important factor since PP:BP ratio may decrease because of PP photoinhibition.

Wiggle-matching on charred wood with bark, excavated from a pyroclastic mud-flow deposited by the huge 10th Century eruption of the Baitoushan Volcano, revealed the eruption age as cal A.D. 935 +8/-5 with 95% confidence. This date is consistent with the eruption age of A.D. 912 to A.D. 972 estimated by dendrochronology on two wooden boards that had clear stratigraphical connections to the B-Tm tephra deposit in Japan, an ash fall layer formed by the eruption of the Baitoushan Volcano. The date is also consistent with an A.D. 937-938 date estimated by the analysis of varved sediments from Lake Ogawarako in Aomori prefecture. The other wooden board collected from the Mawaki archaeological site in Ishikawa prefecture was wiggle-matched as 783 +13/-11 cal B.C. with 95% confidence, which is consistent with the dates of 830 cal B.C. to 759 cal B.C. obtained for seven wooden poles from the same wooden structures as the wooden board.

The results confirm the relatively new thought, that chrysophytes are not indicating oligotrophic waters only, but the wider range of oligotrophic to eutrophic water. In this pool ammonia and nitrate appeared to be the most important chemical variables, determinatting the development of chrysophyte species. Total- and ortho-phosphorus were important variables in the second place. From the physical factors, pH-value here had less influence, while conductivity and alkalinity had none at all. However, some species of Mallomonas are able to develop at higher levels of conductivity than usually assumed. In high concentrations, ammonia could be toxic. Confirming the knowledge from literature, temperature variation is an important factor for the quantitative development of species. In particular, high abundancies occur at temperatures below around 12-14 degrees C, which explains the decrease of chrysophytes in summer time. The presence of organic matter complicates the results and must be taken into account in future studies. For biological assessment of water quality, the results underline the necessity of having knowledge of the ecological characteristics of the individual species.																			0107-055X	1756-1051					1995	15	6					665	676		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb02137.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1995.tb02137.x													WOS:A1995UL98300013

A new epitheliotropic herpesvirus named Acipenser herpesvirus 3 (AciHV-3) was detected in hatchery-reared Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens displaying skin lesions in central Canada. The growths were discovered in the fall, reached average prevalence levels of 0.2-40% and eventually regressed. No unusual mortality was observed. The cellular changes within the lesions included epithelial hyperplasia and were reminiscent of other herpesvirus infections. The virus was not evident in lesions examined by electron microscopy. Skin tissue homogenates from symptomatic sturgeon produced atypical cytopathic effects on a primary Lake Sturgeon cell line, and next-generation sequence analysis of the DNA samples revealed the presence of an alloherpesvirus. A new genotyping PCR assay targeting the major capsid protein sequence detected AciHV-3 in symptomatic Lake Sturgeon as well as other apparently healthy sturgeon species. Bayesian inference of phylogeny reconstructed with a concatenation of five alloherpesvirus core proteins revealed a new Alloherpesviridae lineage isomorphic with a new genus. The presence of AciHV-3 homologs in cell lines and sturgeon sequence datasets, low sequence divergence among these homologs and branching patterns within the genotyping phylogeny provide preliminary evidence of an endogenous virus lifestyle established in an ancestral sturgeon.

The overall gross margin and net return for all the farms were Gh ₵130294.02 and Gh ₵127,261.10 per cycle, respectively. The overall assessment of the profitability performance indicators such as the benefit-cost ratio (BCR), the return on investment (ROI), the net present value (NPV), the operating expense ratio (OE), the operating profit margin (OPM), and the gross margin ratio (GMR) were 1.47, 47.49%, Gh ₵407625.47, 0.77%, 32.20%, and 33.00%, respectively. These indicators showed that small-scale cage fish farming in the study area is profitable. The sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that small-scale cage fish production was robustly profitable. In light of this, the study suggests that stakeholders educate small-scale cage aquaculture farmers on the profitability of the business and make a concerted effort to teach and equip farmers with best management practises (BMPs), water quality management, feeds, and feeding management.

Reducing Nitrate Loss in Tile Drainage Water with Cover Crops and Water-Table Management Systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Nitrate lost from agricultural soils is an economic cost to producers, an environmental concern when it enters rivers and lakes, and a health risk when it enters wells and aquifers used for drinking water. Planting a winter wheat cover crop (CC) and/or use of controlled tile drainage-subirrigation (CDS) may reduce losses of nitrate (NO3-) relative to no cover crop (NCC) and/or traditional unrestricted tile drainage (UTD). A 6-yr (1999-2005) corn-soybean study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of CC+CDS, CC+UTD, NCC+CDS, and NCC+UTD treatments for reducing NO3- loss. Flow volume and NO3 concentration in surface runoff and tile drainage were measured continuously, and CC reduced the 5-yr flow-weighted mean (FWM) NO3- concentration in tile drainage water by 21 to 38% and cumulative NO3- loss by 14 to 16% relative to NCC. Controlled tile drainage-subirrigation reduced FWM NO3 concentration by 15 to 33% and cumulative NO3 loss by 38 to 39% relative to UTD. When CC and CDS were combined, 5-yr cumulative FWM NO3- concentrations and loss in tile drainage were decreased by 47% (from 9.45 to 4.99 mg N L-1 and from 102 to 53.6 kg N ha(-1)) relative to NCC+UTD. The reductions in runoff and concomitant increases in tile drainage under CC occurred primarily because of increases in near-surface soil hydraulic conductivity. Cover crops increased corn grain yields by 4 to 7% in 2004 increased 3-yr average soybean yields by 8 to 15%, whereas CDS did not affect corn or soybean yields over the 6 yr. The combined use of a cover crop and water-table management system was highly effective for reducing NO3- loss from cool, humid agricultural soils.

Paleoclimate support for a persistent dry island effect in the Colombian Andes during the last 4700 years	HOLOCENE												We investigated middle- and late-Holocene hydroclimate patterns in the Colombian Andes using indicators of watershed erosion (lithic abundance), precipitation intensity (% silt), lake-level variability (organic carbon and nitrogen, % sand, and diatoms), and fire frequency (fossil charcoal) from a similar to 4700-year-long sediment archive from Laguna de Ubaque, a small sub-alpine lake on the eastern flank of the eastern Colombian Andes. Our results indicate reduced precipitation, low lake levels, and increased fire occurrence at Ubaque between 4700 and 3500 cal. yr BP (hereafter BP). Precipitation and lake levels increased abruptly while fire occurrence decreased between 3500 and 2100 BP, with the exception of a 300-year dry phase between 2800 and 2500 BP. Although wetter than the 4700-3500 BP interval, precipitation decreased, lake levels fell, and fire occurrence increased after 2100 BP, but with high-frequency variability. Comparison of the Ubaque results with other Colombian paleoclimate records (e.g. Lakes Fuquene and La Cocha) supports an antiphase pattern of precipitation between the high/interior Andes and frontal slope sites. This spatial pattern of variability is consistent with modern responses to the changes in terrestrial atmospheric convection associated with the so-called dry island' effect. Further comparison with paleoclimate records from Venezuela suggests that the millennial trend toward increasing frontal slope precipitation is consistent with orbitally induced increases in Andean atmospheric convection. Sub-orbital dry island-like hydroclimate variability suggests that other mechanisms that affect Northern Hemisphere convection may act to enhance or diminish this effect on centennial and shorter timescales.					; Escobar, Jaime/HSE-4459-2023; Gilhooly III, William/LBH-5383-2024; Polissar, Pratigya/L-8131-2013	Polissar, Pratigya/0000-0001-5483-1625; Correa-Metrio, Alex/0000-0002-1278-2746; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2018	28	2					217	228		10.1177/0959683617721324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617721324													WOS:000424957000004

Amino acids (AAs) are an integral part of OM, and studying their patterns will provide new insights into organic matter dynamics in lakes. Four seasonal field campaigns in eutrophic Lake Taihu and a 14-day phytoplankton degradation experiment were carried out to determine the variability and bioavailability of amino acids. The quality and quantity of AAs varied among different seasons and lake types. The concentrations of particulate (PAA) and dissolved (DAA) AA were 14.67 +/- 13.25 mu M (carbon- and nitrogen-normalized PAA yields: PAA-C%, 23.8 +/- 13.5%; PAA-N%, 22.8 +/- 2.1%) and 2.95 +/- 1.05 mu M (carbon- and nitrogen-normalized DAA yields: DAA-C%, 3.7 +/- 1.1%; DAA-N%, 12.6 +/- 11.2%) in Lake Taihu, respectively. PAA and DAA showed high mean values in the algal-dominated northern area in summer. Glutamic acid (Glu), alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp) and glycine (Gly) contributed to nearly 50% of PAA, while Gly, accounting for 17-24%, was the main component of DAA. During a 14-day phytoplankton degradation period, 98% of Chl a, 63% of POC and 92% of PAA were removed in the dark treatment, and a more obvious downward trend was recorded than in the light treatment. Principal component analysis of the indices of PAA indicated that Glu, arginine (Arg) and histidine (His) were dominant on day 0, while Gly and lysine (Lys) were dominant on day 14. There were notable serine + threonine (Ser + Thr [mol%]) and aspartic acid/glycine ratio (Asp/Gly [mol%]) end-member divisions among different organic matter sources. DAA had higher Ser + Thr [mol%] and lower Asp/Gly [mol%] values than PAA. The amino acid degradation index (DI) of PAA and DAA was 0.97 +/- 0.28 and - 1.04 +/- 0.43, respectively. The fresh DAA from the algae degradation incubation also had DI values similar to those of field DAA in the northern algae-dominated lake region. Amino acid parameters (AA-C%, DI values, Ser + Thr [mol%] and Asp/Gly [mol%]) were calculated to indicate the source, freshness and bioavailability of organic matter in eutrophic shallow Lake Taihu.					; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021	Yao, xin/0000-0002-4151-8784; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2023	30	5					12584	12595		10.1007/s11356-022-23014-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23014-8		SEP 2022						36109485					WOS:000854721700001

The physical limnology of a permanently ice-covered and chemically stratified Antarctic lake using high resolution spatial data from an autonomous underwater vehicle	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used an Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctic Explorer to make measurements of conductivity and temperature in Lake Bonney, a chemically stratified, permanently ice-covered Antarctic lake that abuts Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier from the Polar Plateau. The lake is divided into two lobes - East Lobe Bonney (ELB) and West Lobe Bonney (WLB), each with unique temperature and salinity profiles. Most of our data were collected in November 2009 from WLB to examine the influence of the Taylor Glacier on the structure of the water column. Temperatures adjacent to the glacier face between 20 m and 22 m were 3 degrees C colder than in the rest of WLB, due to latent heat transfer associated with melting of the submerged glacier face and inflow of cold brines that originate beneath the glacier. Melting of the glacier face into the salinity gradient below the chemocline generates a series of nearly horizontal intrusions into WLB that were previously documented in profiles measured with 3 cm vertical resolution in 1990-1991. WLB and ELB are connected by a narrow channel through which water can be exchanged over a shallow sill that controls the position of the chemocline in WLB. A complex exchange flow appears to exist through the narrows, driven by horizontal density gradients and melting at the glacier face. Superimposed on the exchange is a net west-to-east flow generated by the higher volume of meltwater inflows to WLB. Both of these processes can be expected to be enhanced in the future as more meltwater is produced.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Obryk, Maciej/0000-0002-8182-8656; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2018	63	3					1234	1252		10.1002/lno.10768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10768													WOS:000432019600014

Understanding the changes in the lake's eutrophic condition over time is essential for its restoration and management under the background of global changes and regional sustainability. In this context, the compositions of carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta 13Corg and delta 15N, respectively), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) were analysed to depict the history of eutrophic state of Chaohu Lake, and its relationship with environmental changes. The result show that before the 1950s, the primary productivity of the lake was low. During the period from the 1950s to the 1970s, primary productivity increased substantially due to eutrophication. From the 1970s to the present, as a result of the construction of the Chaohu Floodgate Station, water replacement in the semi-closed Chaohu Lake gradually slowed and nutrients began to accumulate more rapidly. These conditions led to enhanced lake productivity and rapid eutrophication, mainly caused by intensified human activities and increased exogenous inputs. Our findings suggest that the geochemical records (delta 13Corg, delta 15N, TOC, TN, and C/N ratios) in sediment for Chaohu Lake are capable of recording important shifts in the temporal evolution of lake-water trophic state.

Decadal changes in zooplankton biomass, composition, and body mass in four shallow brackish lakes in Denmark subjected to varying degrees of eutrophication	INLAND WATERS												During the past century, many brackish shallow lakes worldwide have become eutrophic. How the zooplankton have responded to this development is not well elucidated. Here, we analysed the decadal changes (from 1999-2000 to 2017-2018) in zooplankton biomass, body mass, and potential top-down control on phytoplankton during summer in 4 Danish shallow brackish lakes (Lund Fjord, Han Vejle, Selbjerg, and Glombak) subjected to varying degrees of eutrophication. Significant reductions of zooplankton biomass, body mass, the ratio of large-sized cladoceran to total cladoceran biomass, and the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass were observed in low to moderately vegetated lakes (Selbjerg and Glombak). However, in the macrophyte-dominated lake (Han Vejle), zooplankton biomass, body mass, and the contribution of large-sized cladocerans (Daphnia spp.) to total cladoceran biomass increased without a corresponding increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio, which may be attributed to the refuge effect of submerged macrophytes. Using the pooled dataset, multivariate analysis indicated that total phosphorus concentrations and fish abundance were the main drivers of shifts in the zooplankton community and that zooplankton body mass was strongly negatively related to fish abundance. From a lake management perspective, our results suggest that eutrophication, through increased fish predation and reduced submerged vegetation abundance, has major effects on zooplankton communities in temperate coastal brackish shallow lakes, and a reduction in the zooplankton grazing pressure on phytoplankton is predicted if the eutrophication process continues.

J	Christiansen, B; Ljungqvist, FC				Christiansen, B.; Ljungqvist, F. C.			The extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere temperature in the last two millennia: reconstructions of low-frequency variability	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We present two new multi-proxy reconstructions of the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere (30-90A degrees N) mean temperature: a two-millennia long reconstruction reaching back to 1 AD and a 500-yr long reconstruction reaching back to 1500 AD. The reconstructions are based on compilations of 32 and 91 proxies, respectively, of which only little more than half pass a screening procedure and are included in the actual reconstructions. The proxies are of different types and of different resolutions (annual, annual-to-decadal, and decadal) but all have previously been shown to relate to local or regional temperature. We use a reconstruction method, LOCal (LOC), that recently has been shown to confidently reproduce low-frequency variability. Confidence intervals are obtained by an ensemble pseudo-proxy method that both estimates the variance and the bias of the reconstructions. The two-millennia long reconstruction shows a well defined Medieval Warm Period, with a peak warming ca. 950-1050 AD reaching 0.6 A degrees C relative to the reference period 1880-1960 AD. The 500-yr long reconstruction confirms previous results obtained with the LOC method applied to a smaller proxy compilation; in particular it shows the Little Ice Age cumulating in 1580-1720 AD with a temperature minimum of -1.0 A degrees C below the reference period. The reconstructed local temperatures, the magnitude of which are subject to wide confidence intervals, show a rather geographically homogeneous Little Ice Age, while more geographical inhomogeneities are found for the Medieval Warm Period. Reconstructions based on different subsets of proxies show only small differences, suggesting that LOC reconstructs 50-yr smoothed extra-tropical NH mean temperatures well and that low-frequency noise in the proxies is a relatively small problem.

In this study, the changing characteristics of lake ice phenology at Lake Qinghai (LQH) are investigated using retrieved historical datasets during 1979-2016. The results show that the variation of the lake freeze-up date over LQH is characterized by a strong interannual variability. Further analysis has revealed that November sea ice concentration (SIC) variation in the Kara Sea can exert a great impact on the freeze-up date at LQH. During the low sea ice years, the open sea serves as a strong diabatic heating source, largely contributing to the enhanced Arctic Eliassen-Palmer flux, which then results in the deceleration of zonal wind in the middle and high latitudes. In addition to this, accompanied with the decreasing Kara SIC, the enhanced stationary Rossby wave flux propagating along the high-latitude regions may further exert remarkable influences in deepening the East Asian trough, which provides a favorable atmospheric circulation pattern for cold air intrusion from the Arctic and Siberian regions to mainland China. The decreased surface air temperature would thus advance the freezing date over LQH. Furthermore, the close relationship between atmospheric circulation anomalies and Kara SIC variations is validated by a large ensemble of simulations from the Community Earth System Model, and the atmospheric circulation patterns induced by the SIC anomalies are reproduced to some extent. Therefore, the November Kara Sea ice anomaly might be an important predictor for the variation in the freeze-up date at LQH.

A morphometric analysis of the lungs of high-altitude ducks and geese	JOURNAL OF ANATOMY												We examined the morphology of the lungs of five species of high-altitude resident ducks from Lake Titicaca in the Peruvian Andes (yellow-billed pintail [Anas georgica], cinnamon teal [Anas cyanoptera orinomus], puna teal [Anas puna], speckled teal [Anas flavirostris oxyptera], and ruddy duck [Oxyura jamaicensis ferruginea]) and compared them with those of the high-altitude migratory bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and the low-altitude migratory barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). We then determined the relationship between mass-specific lung volume, the volume densities of the component parts of the lung, and previously reported hypoxia-induced increases in pulmonary O(2)extraction. We found that the mass-specific lung volumes and the mass-specific volume of the exchange tissue were larger in the lungs of high-altitude resident birds. The bar-headed goose had a mass-specific lung volume that fell between those of the low-altitude species and the high-altitude residents, but a mass-specific volume of exchange tissue that was not significantly different than that of the high-altitude residents. The data suggest that the mass-specific volume of the lung may increase with evolutionary time spent at altitude. We found an inverse relationship between the percentage increase in pulmonary O(2)extraction and the percentage increase in ventilation across species that was independent of the volume density of the exchange tissue, at least for the resident Andean birds.					; York, Julia/AAJ-9145-2021; Milsom, William/D-2977-2012	McCracken, Kevin/0000-0002-1477-8839; Bakkeren, Ciska/0000-0002-1485-2728; 													0021-8782	1469-7580				JUL	2020	237	1					188	196		10.1111/joa.13180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joa.13180								32173858					WOS:000541895400013

Isolation contacts in these basins, identified from lithological and diatom analysis, were used together with 25 radiocarbon dates, to construct a relative sea-level (RSL) curve for the Holocene. Records of marine water re-influx were found in the sediment sequence from one lake, located at c. 17 m a.s.l. The re-influx of marine water seems to be caused by the mid-Holocene (Tapes) transgression and tsunami event. The RSL curve indicates several phases in the postglacial evolution of the Kola coast. An early phase of rapid sea-level fall of c. 32 m around 11,500 cal yr BP, at a rate of c. 40 mm per year, corresponds to glacio-isostatically induced emergence following deglaciation at the Younger Dryas and beginning of the Holocene. In the time interval between c. 11,000 and 7600 cal yr BP, either a stillstand or a slight rise in relative sea level, cresting at about 21 m a.s.l., is suggested in the Teriberka area. This is followed, after c. 7300 cal yr BP to the present day, by a slow glacioisostatic emergence with an average rate of about 2-3 mm per year.					; Tolstobrov, Dmitry/J-1880-2018; Korsakova, Olga/HKW-0252-2023; Tolstobrova, Alena/J-1909-2018	Tolstobrov, Dmitry/0000-0003-3858-7647; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2023	33	9					1060	1072		10.1177/09596836231176489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836231176489		MAY 2023											WOS:001001217500001

Soil Water Responses to Wood Ash Addition to Acidic Upland Soils: Implications for Combatting Calcium Decline in Lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Calcium (Ca) concentrations in lakes have declined in many regions, and concerns have been expressed that Ca levels are falling below biologically significant thresholds. Wood ash additions to soil are typically used to combat soil acidification, and it is unclear whether wood ash additions to upland soils will lead to higher Ca leaching to surface waters. In this study we applied fly ash or bottom ash at 4 Mg ha(-1) and 8 Mg ha(-1) to upland soils at replicated plots in Haliburton Forest in central Ontario and measured soil water chemistry at 3 depths over 4 years. Increases in soil water Ca concentration following application were quite modest and occurred primarily in the fly ash treatments in the upper depth (0.3 m) during the first 2 years following application. There was no concomitant increase in pH or acid-neutralizing capacity primarily because of the high sulphate leaching associated with the fly ash treatments. Overall, these results show that wood ash addition to soils at moderate doses will have little impact on soil export to lakes.

The results indicated that the shallow lakes LH14, LH04, and Discussion were well mixed. Lakes LH04 and LH14 on Stornes were affected by salinity, likely sea spray. In contrast, the deeper lakes, namely Nella, Cameron and Progress, were primarily driven by temperature and density dynamics. The hydrological characteristics of Cameron and Progress were notably impacted by their proximity to the ice sheet, while Nella was influenced by the presence of a partial lake ice cover. The lake depth, geographical location and presence of ice cover in the catchment significantly influenced temperature and salinity variations within the lakes. Deep lakes may be more sensitive to changes in temperature and density as compared to shallow lakes and could potentially affect other physical lake parameters. This baseline information is a valuable reference for future investigations on these lakes and similar environments.

Climate controlled ostracod preservation in Lake Ohrid (Albania, Macedonia)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Ohrid (Albania, Macedonia) is probably the oldest existing lake in Europe and thus of great interest for palaeo-environmental and genetic studies. Within more than 220 endemic faunal species known to live in the lake, ostracods are outstanding due to the potentially very long fossil record. They can provide geochemical information over a period exceeding the entire Quaternary and direct evidence for radiation. Here we discuss the ostracod record and the calcite concentration along a 10-m-long sediment core taken at 100 m water depth in the south-eastern, Albanian part of Lake Ohrid. Well preserved ostracod valves representing in-situ fauna only occur from 0 cm to 105 cm and from 476 cm to 933 cm core depth, corresponding to the last interglacial and the Holocene, respectively. Those periods are also characterized by high concentrations of endogen calcite. There is no significant difference in the faunal composition of the two periods separated by several tens of thousand years and we found non-calcitic ostracod remains, especially the strongly chitinised mandibles, throughout the glacial period. Therefore, we conclude that ostracods were present in the lake throughout the entire period represented by the sediment core, but with poor or lacking preservation of their calcite valves during the glacial period. Calcite precipitation and ostracod preservation were most likely inhibited by the complete interruption of Calcium supply from karsts springs, which were inactive during the glacial periods due to permafrost in large parts of the calcareous mountains.

The Special Protection Area Durankulak Lake (SPA DL) is a coastal lake in northeast Bulgaria, part of the Natura 2000 network that was declared as important area for wintering, breeding and migratory birds. Despite a number of conservation efforts outlined for the SPAs of Natura 2000 network, the potential threats and influences of haemosporidians and other parasites on occurring birds were not considered. In the present study, we aim to investigate the richness of haemosporidian parasites in birds captured in the protected area and to report the parasite species/DNA lineages that undergo local transmission in the region. We used both microscopic examination and PCR-based methods to diagnose haemosporidian infections in juvenile (captured in the year of hatching) and adult birds. The overall prevalence of haemosporidian parasites was significantly higher in the adult birds compared to juveniles. We identified five out of 21 recorded cytochrome b (cyt b) parasite lineages that are locally transmitted in the SPA DL (one of the genus Haemoproteus Kruse, 1890 and four of genus Plasmodium Marchiafava and Celli, 1885): cyt b lineages hRW2 of Haemoproteus belopolskyi, pSGS1 of Plasmodium relictum, pCOLL1, pYWT4 and pPADOM01 of Plasmodium (Haemamoeba) spp. It is likely that the majority of the parasites with local transmission are widespread host generalists and that host exchange is rather frequent among the birds inhabiting SPA DL.

This study developed a specific Ecosystem Health Index (LP-EHI) for Lake Poyang in China. LP-EHI quantified lake health from the perspectives of physical, chemical, biological integrity and social service. Physical integrity indices included hydrological conditions (water level and runoff), basic morphometric characteristics (lake area and shoreline), and tributary connectivity. Chemical integrity indices used water quality, nutrition, and toxicity to quantify chemical impairment. Biological integrity indicators covered six major components of the aquatic food chain, namely, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, wetland plants, fish, and wintering birds. Social service indices included drinking water, pathogenic potential, flood storage capacity, sand mining, and dish-shaped sub-lake areas under management to measure whether the lake fulfilled the needs of human society. Reference and impaired conditions for each metric were defined by "historical" conditions, "least disturbed" conditions, national standards and expert opinions. The value of LP-EHI ranging from 0 to 1 was divided into five health conditions: excellent (>= 0.8), good (0.6-0.8), fair (0.4-0.6), poor (0.2-0.4) and bad (<0.2). The metrics' reliability was further validated using a box-and-whisker plot test. The developed index (LP-EHI) is so far the most comprehensive index to evaluate ecosystem health for Lake Poyang, and is well reflected in the unique characteristics of Lake Poyang. It can enhance our understanding of lake health conditions and thus guide lake management to achieve better health conditions.					; Gao, Junfeng/JDV-8786-2023; Jiacong, Huang/F-9875-2013; Huang, Qi/IAO-2300-2023; Wang, Shigang/AAF-5686-2020	Huang, Jiacong/0000-0003-4296-5823; Huang, Qi/0000-0003-1073-7471; 														2073-4441				JUL	2018	10	7							943	10.3390/w10070943	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10070943													WOS:000442579700126

Analysis of the TSP, PM10 concentrations and water-soluble ionic species in airborne samples over Sistan, Iran during the summer dusty period	ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH												The present study analyzes the total suspended particulates (TSP) and particulate matter less than 10 mm (PM10) concentrations along with the water-soluble ionic species (WSIS) in airborne dust samples collected in Zabol, located in the Sistan basin of southeast Iran. Rather extreme TSP and PM10 mean concentrations of 1867.0 mu g m(-3) and 433.4 mu g m(-3) are found, while the WSIS contribute only 8.9% and 19.3% to the TSP and PM10 mass, respectively indicating large fraction of water-insoluble crustal elements, carbonaceous aerosols and heavy metals that remained unexplored. Ca2+ is the most abundant ionic species contributing similar to 25-26% to the total WSIS mass, followed by NH4+, K+, and SO42. Important fractions of Cl- and Na+ (7-9% of the total WSIS mass) indicate the presence of saline dust storms over Sistan due to desiccation of the Hamoun lakes and uplift of evaporated minerals by the strong Levar (120-days) wind. High correlations between the WSIS suggest large possibility for formation of NaCl, (NH4)(2)SO4, MgSO4, K2SO4, CaSO4 and NH4NO3. The dusty days (visibility < 2 km) are associated with intense winds (11.7 ms(-1) on average) and large increase (similar to 80-100%) in the concentrations of the crustal elements (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl-) compared to the normal days, while the TSP and PM10 concentrations reach to 4496 mu gm(-3) and 1010.6 mu gm(-3), respectively.

Hydrologic parameters for the model were first estimated in a calibration exercise using a 9-yr historical record (1990-1998) of climatic and hydrologic stresses. The model reproduced observed temporal and spatial trends in surface/ groundwater levels across the watershed. Mid-Holocene aquifer and lake levels were then reconstructed using two paleoclimatic data sets: CCM1 atmospheric general circulation model output and pollen-transfer functions using sediment core data from Williams Lake. Calculated paleo-lake levels based on pollen-derived paleoclimatic reconstructions indicated a 3.5-m drop in simulated lake levels and were in good agreement with the position of mid-Holocene beach sands observed in a Williams Lake sediment core transect. However, calculated paleolake levels based on CCM1 climate forcing produced only a 0.05-m drop in lake levels. We found that decreases in winter precipitation rather than temperature increases had the largest effect on simulated mid-Holocene lake levels. The study illustrates how watershed models can be used to critically evaluate paleoclimatic reconstructions by integrating geologic, climatic, limnologic, and hydrogeologic data sets.

Depositions were sampled monthly across the lake at four depths (0.2 m; 2m; 6m; 30m) during two years (1983-1984). Organic and ash fractions of sediment cores collected along a depth gradient were assessed in the summer of 1984. The result show: The mean amount of organic matter deposition (size > 10 .mu.m) is 1.24 g m-2 d-1 (dry weight) (i.e. 452.6 g m-2 year-1): The metabolism of Large Particulate Organic Matter (L.P.P.M.) occurs primarily in the littoral zones not farther than 30 m offshore and the dispersibility of the L.P.O.M. may be predicted by a negative exponential model; The deposition on the bottom comprised under the perimeter of about 80% of the lake surface, is principally autochthonous (planktonic in origin); The detritus settled out of the water column is not completely processed and about half of the total material enters the slow cycle of the sediment on the deepest zone of the lake.

Concentrations of total algal biomass and of particular algal species were monitored and compared with the pigment contents (chlorophyll a and phycocyanin) and photosynthetic rate of the algal populations. The specific photosynthetic rate (micrograms of C fixed per microgram of chlorophyll a per h) was a good measure of the physiological state of the algae because this quantity increased just before each population increase and decreased before algal densities diminished. Since the quantity of light in the epilimnion which was available for photosynthesis by algal cells decreased in summer when the high algal densities attenuated incoming radiation, the possibility that the organisms would utilize lower light intensities more efficiently by increasing their pigment contents was investigated. Although some evidence of enhanced utilization of low light levels was found in the period from July-Oct., this result was not due to increasing chlorophyll and phycocyanin contents. There was a decrease in the phycocyanin content of the algae during this period, perhaps related to the availability of inorganic N.

Dynamic ice stream retreat in the central sector of the last British-Irish Ice Sheet	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), ice streams of the last British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) controlled ice discharge from various dispersal centres. Deglaciation was characterised by shifts in ice-divide location and changes in internal ice-sheet dynamics, resulting in substantial flow switches and significant ice-stream reconfiguration, and hence modification of their landform signatures. We present new geomorphological mapping and 11 Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide ages from Northern England (Stainmore Gap, Eden Valley and Vale of York), that constrain regional dynamic ice-stream retreat following the LGM. We identify complex decoupling of competing ice lobes, characterised by early retreat of the North Sea Lobe and a minor re-advance of Stainmore ice prior to similar to 20 ka. This was followed by rapid recession of the central Stainmore Gap, which was ice-free by 19.8 0.7 to 18.0 +/- 0.5 ka, contemporaneous with the recession of the Tyne Gap Ice Stream. In the southern Vale of Eden, Crossby Ravensworth Fell became exposed between 19.2 and 20.3 ka. The northwards ice-flow reversal in the Vale of Eden was associated with the development of ice domes across the northern Pennines, Howgill Fells and the Lake District. This shift in dispersal centres and ice divide migration likely triggered the rapid collapse of eastward ice stream corridors. The central sector of the BIIS rapidly collapsed back up into upland dispersal centres between 20 and 17.5 ka. This work highlights the role internal factors, such as topography, in driving ice-divide migration and flow switches during externally and climatically forced ice-sheet thinning.

Quantification of human-associated fecal indicators reveal sewage from urban watersheds as a source of pollution to Lake Michigan	WATER RESEARCH												Sewage contamination of urban waterways from sewer overflows and failing infrastructure is a major environmental and public health concern. Fecal coliforms (FC) are commonly employed as fecal indicator bacteria, but do not distinguish between human and non-human sources of fecal contamination. Human Bacteroides and human Lachnospiraceae, two genetic markers for human-associated indicator bacteria, were used to identify sewage signals in two urban rivers and the estuary that drains to Lake Michigan. Grab samples were collected from the rivers throughout 2012 and 2013 and hourly samples were collected in the estuary across the hydrograph during summer 2013. Human Bacteroides and human Lachnospiraceae were highly correlated with each other in river samples (Pearson's r = 0.86), with average concentrations at most sites elevated during wet weather. These human indicators were found during baseflow, indicating that sewage contamination is chronic in these waterways. FC are used for determining total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) in management plans; however, FC concentrations alone failed to prioritize river reaches with potential health risks. While 84% of samples with >1000 CFU/ 100 ml FC had sewage contamination, 52% of samples with moderate (200-1000 CFU/100 ml) and 46% of samples with low (<200 CFU/100 ml) FC levels also had evidence of human sewage. Load calculations in the in the Milwaukee estuary revealed storm-driven sewage contamination varied greatly among events and was highest during an event with a short duration of intense rain. This work demonstrates urban areas have unrecognized sewage inputs that may not be adequately prioritized for remediation by the TMDL process. Further analysis using these approaches could determine relationships between land use, storm characteristics, and other factors that drive sewage contamination in urban waterways.

Morphological and molecular effects of two diluted bitumens on developing fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Canada has experienced a significant increase in the transport of diluted bitumen (dilbit), a predominant oil sands product that combines bitumen with diluents derived from oil-gas condensates and other proprietary compounds. The toxicity of dilbit to fish embryos, which are immobile and thus at a high risk of exposure to oil in the event of a spill, remains largely unknown for most species. This study assessed the toxicity of water accommodated fractions (WAF) and chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAF) of two winter dilbit blends, Access Western Blend (AWB) and Cold Lake Blend (CLB), to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. The TPH-F EC50s for malformations were 834 and 1058 mu g/L for AWB WAF and CEWAF, respectively, and 500 and 715 mu g/L for CLB WAF and CEWAF, respectively. Levels of cypla mRNA increased up to 46- and 69-fold, respectively, reflecting increasing exposure to polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in AWB and CLB. Similarly, levels of gst mRNA were elevated up to 3.8-fold and 2.7-fold with increasing total concentrations of PACs in AWB and CLB, respectively. However, there were no significant changes in mRNA levels of p53, sod, cat, and gsr. These results suggest that the expression of cyp1a and gst may serve as biomarkers for dilbit exposure in fathead minnow, furthering our understanding of dilbit-responsive indicators of toxicity in fish species native to North America. This study is important as it utilizes the same exposure methodology to examine the toxicity of two commonly used Canadian dilbits, facilitating comparison of dilbit toxicity.

However, prey biomass may be insufficient to support the current predator demand. In August 1997, we assessed the abundance and spatial distribution of pelagic coregonines and rainbow smelt in western Lake Superior by combining a 120 kHz split beam acoustics system with midwater trawls. Coregonines comprised the majority of the midwater trawl catches and the length distributions for trawl caught fish coincided with estimated sizes of acoustic targets. Overall mean pelagic prey fish biomass was 15.56 kg ha(-1) with the greatest fish biomass occurring in the Apostle Islands region (27.98 kg ha(-1)), followed by the Duluth Minnesota region (20.22 kg ha(-1)), and with the lowest biomass occurring in the open waters of western Lake Superior (9.46 kg ha(-1)). Biomass estimates from hydroacoustics were typically 2-134 times greater than estimates derived from spring bottom trawl surveys. Prey fish biomass for Lake Superior is about order of magnitude less than acoustic estimates for Lakes Michigan and Ontario. Discrepancies observed between bioenergetics-based estimates of predator consumption of coregonines and earlier coregonine biomass estimates may be accounted for by our hydroacoustic estimates.

Part 1-Reduction of nutrient loading through low-cost and highly effective ecohydrological measures	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The study presented in this paper aimed to improve the water quality of a small, stormwater-fed urban river and a cascade of ponds and reservoirs (Lodz, Poland) that are intensively used for recreation. We tested a combination of conventional restoration methods (bottom sediment removal and biomanipulation) and comprehensive ecohydrological restoration methods (hybrid systems, sequential sedimentation-biofiltration systems (SSBS), floating islands, landform-adjusted shoreline vegetation and plant harvesting). As a result of sediment removal (9795 m(3), cost: (sic)80761), almost 12.5 tons of nitrogen and 197 kg of phosphorous were eliminated from the reservoirs. The hybrid systems and SSBSs reduced the nutrient transport and suspended solid levels by 49%-98.5% and 89.6%-98.6%, respectively, from the upstream catchments to the reservoirs (investment cost: (sic)63929). Generally, restoration improved most of the water quality indicators, although an increase in the phosphate concentration was observed from 0.06 to 0.17 mg L-1 before restoration to 0.13-0.28 mg L-1 immediately after restoration as a result of disturbances resulting from bottom sediment removal. Four years after restoration, the concentrations of the total forms of nutrients and ammonium were still considerably lower than before restoration. The number of summer days with microcystins and with chlorophyll a concentrations above the WHO limits for recreational waters decreased. However, there was a gradual decline in the physicochemical parameters of the water due to the local impacts of human use (swimming and duck and fish feeding), rather than from other external or internal loads, which were effectively controlled.

J	Li, HC; Bischoff, JL; Ku, TL; Zhu, ZY				Li, HC; Bischoff, JL; Ku, TL; Zhu, ZY			Climate and hydrology of the Last Interglaciation (MIS 5) in Owens Basin, California: isotopic and geochemical evidence from core OL-92	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												delta(18)O, delta(13)C, total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon, and acid-leachable Li, Mg and Sr concentrations on 443 samples from 32 to 83 m depth in Owens Lake core OL-92 were analyzed to study the climatic and hydrological conditions between 60 and 155 ka with a resolution of similar to200 a. The multi-proxy data show that Owens Lake overflowed during wet/cold conditions of marine isotope stages (MIS) 4, 5b and 6, and was closed during the dry/warm conditions of MIS 5a, c and e. The lake partially overflowed during MIS 5d. Our age model places the MIS 4/5 boundary at ca 72.5 ka and the MIS 5/6 boundary (Termination 11) at ca 140 ka, agreeing with the Devils Hole chronology. The diametrical precipitation intensities between the Great Basin (cold/wet) and eastern China (cold/dry) on Milankovitch time scales imply a climatic teleconnection across the Pacific. It also probably reflects the effect of high-latitude ice sheets on the southward shifts of both the summer monsoon frontal zone in eastern Asia and the polar jet stream in western North America during glacial periods.

Holocene precipitation changes in the Maya forest, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Holocene fossil pollen samples (n = 38) from Lake Silvituc in Mexico were analyzed with the analog technique using modern pollen samples (n = 98) of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Calculated dissimilarity indices allow us to reconstruct the vegetation and to develop a precipitation record for the last 7900 years. The Middle Holocene shows a gradual increase of precipitation and a marked drop in reconstructed precipitation around 4200 BCE. During the Late Holocene two phases were identified: Phase I (2500 BCE - 1 CE) shows the greatest increase in precipitation with four peaks around 1200 BCE, 650 BCE, 200 BCE and 1 CE. Also a period of increased precipitation resulted for the period between 200 and 500 BCE. Periods of reduced precipitation were detected at 900-1100 BCE, 500-600 BCE and 100-190 BCE.. Phase II (1-2000 CE) encompasses several strong dry events during the following periods: 150-300 CE, 750-900 CE, 1050-1180 CE, and 1530-1580 CE. A strong reduction of 32% in precipitation in the late Preclassic Period (100-300 CE) was detected. Non-analogs of Phase II are associated with periods of reduced precipitation and fall into time periods of extended droughts related to the Maya Late Classic and the Little Ice Age. A limiting factor on the use of analogs for tropical forests is that a combination of different analogs for the same fossil pollen signal exists. Interpretation under these circumstances requires good knowledge of the ecology of the taxa and a priori characterization of the modern samples.

The lakes are located on the northern and southern sides of the Alps from the western Bernese to the eastern Julian Alps. Due to the different origins of the data set here considered, different sampling years and sampling methodologies were adopted. All of the lakes were sampled during the ice-free season, but 79/89 lakes were sampled mainly in autumn 2000, while for a few of them the sample dated back to 1996 or the early 90s. Samples were taken by kicking the different substrata or a stretch of lakeshore (10-30 m) for at least 2-5 min with a standard net and were then preserved in alcohol. Larvae and pupal exuviae were sampled by skimming the lake surface with the same net, to extend identification to species level. Notwithstanding the large altitudinal gradient, almost all of the lakes are situated above the timberline, and show a wide range of morphological (depth, watershed and lake area) and chemical characteristics. Chironomids were the most abundant insects represented in these lakes, with highest abundances at pH between 6.0 and 7.5. In particular, Orthocladiinae and Chironominae were the two subfamilies with the widest distribution. Altitude and temperature played an important role in determining their distribution, the higher altitudes were dominated by the former, whereas the latter were more numerous in lower lakes. The prevalence of Orthocladiinae and Tanytarsini at high altitudes was regarded as a general pattern of taxonomic composition in harsh climatic areas. A reverse condition occurred only in the Julian Alps, where Tanytarsini dominate, followed by Tanypodinae and rare Orthocladiinae. Although our results demonstrated that the composition of chironomid assemblages was also determined by pH, the pattern was unbalanced. Due to the fact that no cases of strong water acidification were present, taxa restricted to very low pH were poorly represented (only three taxa-Limnophyes, Endochironomus and Orthocladius (O.) spp.) compared with circumneutral (8) and alkaline (14) taxa, which occurred in slightly acid and non-acidified soft water lakes. As regard conductivity and altitude, we found that almost all the taxa present at higher pH were contemporary present at conductivity higher than 100 mu eq l(-1) and altitude lower than 2100 m a.s.l. At species level, Pseudodiamesa branickii, Corynoneura arctica, Heterotrissocladius marcidus and Paratanytarsus austriacus resulted to be the most ubiquitous and abundant species in the Alps. When the west to east distribution of taxa was taken into account, Chironomini (particularly the genera Chironomus and Dicrotendipes) and Tanypodinae (Larsia and Paramerina) were more typical of the eastern lakes (JA). They may be better indicators of more alkaline waters. Assembling all the existing data and presenting a comprehensive panorama of lake-littoral chironomid taxa of the Alps was one of the aims of this paper. Further monitoring, but also harmonization of the sampling methodologies and taxonomical identification including inter-calibration exercises among laboratories are recommended, to provide reliable basis and more knowledge for future studies of comparative biogeography, and to preserve these environments where global climatic changes may cause abrupt shifts in the faunal assemblages with a loss of taxa typical of these mountainous areas.					; Lencioni, Valeria/O-4738-2019; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Lencioni, Valeria/G-1935-2011; Boggero, Angela/F-2950-2016; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008	Simcic, Tatjana/0000-0001-6540-926X; Lencioni, Valeria/0000-0002-4341-9923; Boggero, Angela/0000-0002-7534-3126; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2006	562						145	165		10.1007/s10750-005-1809-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1809-6													WOS:000236780200008

Effect of reducing allochthonous P load on biomass and alkaline phosphatase activity of phytoplankton in an urbanized watershed, Michigan	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus (P) concentrations have declined in the Huron River in southeast Michigan subsequent to first a municipal ordinance, and later state legislation, restricting the application of commercial fertilizers containing phosphate. One management objective of the environmental policy was to reduce eutrophication of surface waters and nuisance blooms of cyanobacteria, particularly in large impoundments along the Huron River. Alternative management theory contended that nuisance algal conditions resulted from internal loading of P within the lakes rather than the allochthonous nutrient load. In summer 2012 during conditions of relative drought, we had an opportunity to test whether reduced river P was intensifying P limitation among phytoplankton in impoundments receiving the river water. We compared chlorophyll concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity measured in 2012 to measurements at the same sites obtained using identical methods in 2004 and 2005, before P reductions were implemented. A large bloom of Aphanizomenon developed in 2012 after a polymictic episode mixed high concentrations of P from the anoxic hypolimnion throughout the lake. Algal biomass was higher and alkaline phosphatase activity levels in 2012 were significantly lower at all sites than in 2004 and 2005, despite reduced supply rate of riverine P. The results confirm that reducing nonpoint source P runoff in the upstream catchment alone is not an efficacious management strategy for these lakes.

Characteristics of Important Stopover Locations for Migrating Birds: Remote Sensing with Radar in the Great Lakes Basin	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												A preliminary stage in developing comprehensive conservation plans involves identifying areas used by the organisms of interest. The areas used by migratory land birds during temporal breaks in migration (stopover periods) have received relatively little research and conservation attention. Methodologies for identifying stopover sites across large geographic areas have been, until recently, unavailable. Advances in weather-radar technology now allow for evaluation of bird migration patterns at large spatial scales. We analyzed radar data (WSR-88D) recorded during spring migration in 2000 and 2001 at 6 sites in the Great Lakes basin (U.S.A.). Our goal was to link areas of high migrant activity with the land-cover types and landscape contexts corresponding to those areas. To characterize the landscapes surrounding stopover locations, we integrated radar and land-cover data within a geographic information system. We compared landscape metrics within 5 km of areas that consistently hosted large numbers of migrants with landscapes surrounding randomly selected areas that were used by relatively few birds during migration. Concentration areas were characterized by 1.2 times more forest cover and 9.3 times more water cover than areas with little migrant activity. We detected a strong negative relationship between activity of migratory birds and agricultural land uses. Examination of individual migration events confirmed the importance of fragments of forested habitat in highly altered landscapes and highlighted large concentrations of birds departing from near-shore terrestrial areas in the Great Lakes basin. We conclude that conservation efforts can be more effectively targeted through intensive analysis of radar imagery.

Postglacial history of alpine vegetation, fire, and climate from Laguna de Rio Seco, Sierra Nevada, southern Spain	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Sierra Nevada of southern Spain is a landscape with a rich biological and cultural heritage. The range was extensively glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline - Laguna de Rio Seco at 3020 m elevation - in a paleoecological study documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, fire and climate change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that pine trees grew around the lake, and fire was relatively unimportant at this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Rio Seco occurred before 7800 cal yr BR This is in contrast to lower elevation sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000 cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Rio Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus. Artemisia, and others). The disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand, Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Rio Seco record after ca 4000 cal yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations, fire occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record confirms that even remote sites were not free of direct human influence during the Holocene.

J	Safaei, SH; Young, S				Safaei, S. H.; Young, S.			Decentralized Algae Removal Technologies for Lake Diefenbaker Irrigation Canals: A Review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Lake Diefenbaker Irrigation Canals in Canada are crucial in providing water for irrigation, preventing droughts and floods, and supporting the Saskatchewan agriculture industry and economy. Unfortunately, filamentous algal blooms occur every summer in Lake Diefenbaker Irrigation Canals. These algae are not toxic but a nuisance. They block farmers' pumps and reduce irrigation water flow rates. Currently, the Water Security Agency periodically adds the algaecide Magnacide H. to control the algal blooms, which is costly (i.e., one million dollars per year for the Lake Diefenbaker M1 Irrigation Canal only) and requires effort to dewater the canal to protect fish. Therefore, algae removal before the canal water enters farmer's pumps might be a cost-effective alternative, especially the removal of microalgae during the initial stages of growth in June of each year. This paper has summarized and evaluated algae removal technologies, considering their advantages, disadvantages, and potential solutions for addressing the challenges and limitations associated with these technologies. Five algae removal technologies were identified as promising, which are suspended air flotation (SAF), dissolved air flotation (DAF), hydrodynamic cavitation, spiral blade centrifuge, and coagulation. Among them, SAF seems the most suitable option, while DAF and hydrodynamic cavitation offer eco-friendly advantages. Further research and pilot testing are needed to determine the costeffective and feasible algae removal technology for Lake Diefenbaker Irrigation Canals.

J	Fok, HS; He, Q				Fok, Hok Sum; He, Qing			Water Level Reconstruction Based on Satellite Gravimetry in the Yangtze River Basin	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												The monitoring of hydrological extremes requires water level measurement. Owing to the decreasing number of continuous operating hydrological stations globally, remote sensing indices have been advocated for water level reconstruction recently. Nevertheless, the feasibility of gravimetrically derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) and its corresponding index for water level reconstruction have not been investigated. This paper aims to construct a correlative relationship between observed water level and basin-averaged Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) TWS and its Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI), for the Yangtze river basin on a monthly temporal scale. The results are subsequently compared against traditional remote sensing, Palmer's Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices. Comparison of the water level reconstructed from GRACE TWS and its index, and that of remote sensing against observed water level reveals a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) above 0.90 and below 0.84, with a Root-Mean-Squares Error (RMSE) of 0.88-1.46 m, and 1.41-1.88 m and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) above 0.81 and below 0.70, respectively. The ENSO-reconstructed water levels are comparable to those based on remote sensing, whereas the PDSI-reconstructed water level shows a similar performance to that of GRACE TWS. The water level predicted at the location of another station also exhibits a similar performance. It is anticipated that the basin-averaged, remotely-sensed hydrological variables and their standardized forms (e.g., GRACE TWS and GRACE-DSI) are viable alternatives for reconstructing water levels for large river basins affected by the hydrological extremes under ENSO influence.

Comparison of carbon and water vapor exchange of forest and grassland in permafrost regions, Central Yakutia, Russia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Boreal grasslands have been largely neglected in carbon and water vapor flux models despite being originated by past global climate changes. Therefore in this study, meteorological conditions, water vapor and CO2 fluxes were measured by the eddy correlation technique simultaneously in a larch forest and alas ecosystem (grassland thermokarst depression) in Central Yakutia, eastern Siberia, during the growing season of 2006 (approximately 100 days, May 23rd-August 31st). The alas ecosystem was a carbon sink (-1.38 tC ha(-1)) but had a 60% lower carbon sequestration capacity than the surrounding larch forest (-3.44 tC ha(-1)) during the study period. Despite this large difference in carbon exchange, water loss from the alas ecosystem (118 mm) was only 13% lower than that from the forest ecosystem (136 mm). Water vapor flux measured in the alas was higher under similar environmental conditions when the source was the lake water than when the source was the grassland. This supports the theory that lake evaporation contributes significantly to the evaporation from the alas as indicated also by the lake water level constant decrease during the growing season. Mid-summer forest and alas mean evapotranspiration was 1.4 and 1.2 mm d(-1) respectively. Mean daily canopy conductance was higher in the forest than in the alas (3.8 and 2.4 mm s(-1), respectively) as expected due to differences in canopy architecture at each site. In this study a rough estimate of the NEE of grassland in Central Yakutia shows an underestimation of 0.9 x 10(-3) Pg if this area is considered as forested, as most regional models do. Our results suggest that a more detail analysis of distinctive areas within the territory of eastern Siberia is needed in order to obtain a better understanding of carbon and water fluxes from this immense boreal region. Furthermore, if the present global warming evokes landscape change from forest to grassland, the carbon sink capacity of this boreal region could be significantly reduced. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Possible institutions face two interlinked challenges. Firstly, large scale horticultural activities as a core economic activity in the basin require substantial and regular amounts of irrigation water, abstracted from the lake and its aquifer. The lake level and thus irrigation water availability reveal a falling trend over the last two decades, which calls for institutions aimed at restricting further expansion in water use. Secondly, the region is characterized by volatile weather conditions where periods of average and above average rainfall have alternated with prolonged droughts for centuries. That leads to highly volatile water inflows into the lake. The two challenges combined thus call for water management institutions that support sustainable water use in both the short and the long run. This study therefore investigates the effect of water institutions already existing or proposed by local stakeholder organizations on preserving target lake levels against a background of highly volatile water availability which negatively affects the economic viability of institutions. To take the absence of functioning basin-wide coordination mechanisms for water allocation into account, we employ the solution format of Multiple Optimization Problems with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPEC) in our integrated hydro-economic model. Stochastic scenario simulations with the model reveal that compliance to water regulations and thus the viability of water institutions in the Naivasha Basin would require very high penalties which are not likely to be accepted by users.

Morphological Features of the Vendace (Coregonus albula) Population from Lake Pleshcheyevo at the Beginning of the 21st Century	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												This article analyzes the morphological and ecological features of the Pereslavl vendace (an endemic population of Coregonus albula that inhabits Lake Pleshcheyevo). The features of the size-growth and sexual structures, fecundity, and growth rate of the population for 2013-2017 have been studied. It is shown that the main trends for the current population of vendace from this lake are a decrease in the fish size and growth rate and fecundity. We believe that these changes result from the removal of fishing pressure on this population at the end of the 20th century, which has led to an increase in its abundance. The decrease in the growth rate and linear size of vendace from Lake Pleshcheyevo is due to increased intraspecific competition, in particular, during summer bottom hypoxia. This paper also discusses the results of a comparison of the morphological parameters of two sympatric phylogenetic lineages of vendace from Lake Pleshcheyevo (E and ALBP2) that currently cohabit the lake, but differ in origin. It is important that, despite a high genetic differentiation and different origins of these lineages, the morphological diversification of their representatives is very small and all the specimens belong to the same species, Coregonus albula.

The role of cattle drinking troughs in amphibian conservation	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Amphibians are the vertebrate group experiencing the steepest global population decline and species loss. Habitat alteration and loss caused by the intensification of agriculture is among the main causes; however, in the past, amphibians have been favoured by traditional agriculture and husbandry as more terrestrial and aquatic habitats became available through land-use diversification and the construction of artificial facilities for cattle watering. Troughs for cattle watering may represent the only permanent water points for amphibian reproduction in human-modified landscapes. The present study focused on Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis, a semi-aquatic salamander, subendemic and widespread in Italy, capable of colonizing artificial aquatic habitats. The main goal was to determine the importance of drinking troughs for the ecology and conservation of the species in a hilly area (Latium region, Central Italy) subjected to traditional livestock farming (i.e. Maremmana cattle). Specifically, generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyse the effects of drinking trough characteristics (i.e. size, substrate, aquatic vegetation), landscape features (distance to the forest, forest cover, percentage of cultivated lands and infrastructural development, terrestrial connectivity) and intensity of management practices on the occurrence and abundance of the target species. In the light of the present results, it is suggested that drinking troughs represent suitable surrogates for pristine habitats for L. vulgaris meridionalis. Hence, even man-made aquatic habitats, associated with traditional husbandry, may help to sustain amphibian populations in landscapes where natural wetlands are scarce. The present findings are timely because of the lack of empirical data on the role of drinking troughs in amphibian conservation within rural socio-economic scenarios, which may have been neglected in research and policy in favour of lakes, rivers and streams.

In-depth scientific knowledge on these peculiar habitats is needed, on which to base integrated and sustainable management plans. Freshwater diatoms, thanks to their high diversity and their particular sensitivity to the water chemistry, can be considered powerful ecological indicators, as they are able to reflect environmental changes over time. The aim of the present study was to analyze the diatomic diversity of the Pilato and Palazzo Borghese lakes, two small temporary high-mountain basins, falling in a protected area within the Apennine mountains chain (central Italy). Diatoms data were collected, at the same time as 12 physicochemical parameters, through six microhabitat samplings, from 17 June to 30 August 2019. In both lakes, a total of 111 diatomic species and varieties were identified. The most species-rich genera were Gomphonema, Navicula, and Nitzschia. The Pilato Lake showed a diatomic community dominated by few species, favored by more stable and predictable environmental conditions than the Palazzo Borghese Lake, which hosted a more diversified community, guaranteed by greater spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Both lakes were characterized by the presence of diatomic species typical of good quality waters. The occurrence of numerous aerial species reflected adaptation strategies adopted to colonize environments subjected to extended drought periods. Endangered diatomic species of particular conservational interest were recorded, confirming the need to preserve their habitats.					lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016	Padula, Rosalba/0000-0003-1756-0947; lorenzoni, massimo/0000-0002-8548-9487; Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287														2076-3298				AUG	2021	8	8							79	10.3390/environments8080079	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments8080079													WOS:000689276200001

Depth and temperature drive patterns of spatial overlap among fish thermal guilds in lakes across Ontario, Canada	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimThe spatial distribution of ectotherms is strongly dependent on the temperature of their environments. In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated during summer stratification. This habitat partitioning, or niche complementarity, may play a role in the coexistence of trophically similar species; however, the extent of partitioning is dependent on the resources available within each habitat. Although habitat partitioning of fish thermal guilds has been studied in individual lakes, broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and segregation are not yet understood. In this study, we explore the patterns and drivers of spatial overlap among thermal guilds (cold-, cool-, and warm-water) at a broad scale.LocationOntario, Canada.MethodsWe built a multivariate regression tree to explore patterns and environmental drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes across three thermal guilds from 438 lakes.ResultsWe identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap among the three thermal guilds. Temperature (growing degree days) and maximum lake depth were strong drivers of the spatial overlap patterns.Main ConclusionsThese findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.

Export of Dissolved Organic Carbon from a Ponded Freshwater Marsh Receiving Diverted Mississippi River Water	THESCIENTIFICWORLDJOURNAL												A series of diversion projects has been implemented to reintroduce Mississippi River water into Louisiana's coastal wetlands in order to reduce wetland loss. The export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured in a 3,700-ha ponded freshwater marsh that receives diverted Mississippi River water. Results show that highly organic marsh soil and plant material are a source of DOC. DOC, on average, was 3 mg/l greater in outlet water as compared to the concentration in river water entering the wetland. DOC in water leaving the marsh was higher in summer months, with a concentration up to 18 mg/l. Based on a discharge of 1,000 ft(3)/sec (28.3 m(3)/sec), it was estimated that the equivalent of 7,335 kg/day of DOC would be exported from the marsh into Lake Cataouatche, located in the northern portion of the Louisiana Barataria Basin estuary. Results suggest that river diversion would likely increase the export of DOC from the marsh as compared to normal transport associated with rainfall and tidal exchange.

Endmembers were derived from laboratory reflectance measurements of water-sediment mixtures with a range of sediment concentrations. Using these reference spectra, we applied a linear mixture analysis to multispectral images after accounting for instrument and atmosphere gains and offsets. Sediment concentrations were estimated for individual pixels from the mixture analysis results based on a nonlinear calibration curve relating laboratory sediment concentrations and reflectance to endmember fractions. The uncertainty in the sediment concentrations derived from this analysis for three Amazon images is predicted to be within +/- 20 mg/L, and the concentrations fall within a range of concentrations of suspended sediment that were measured at several times and places in the field over the past 15 years. The emphasis of our work is to use the patterns of sediment concentrations to compute the approximate volumes of sediment that are transferred between the main channel and floodplain of the Amazon River. However, the methodology can be applied universally if the optical properties of water and sediment at the site are known, and it is, therefore, useful for the study of suspended sediment concentrations in surface waters of wetlands elsewhere.																			0034-4257					MAR	1993	43	3					281	301		10.1016/0034-4257(93)90071-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(93)90071-5													WOS:A1993KN75900004

Much attention has been paid to the species diversity of copepods worldwide, but the phylogeography and genetic diversity of copepods in Nigeria is unexplored. Results Using a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker, we preformed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses for Cyclopidae copepods in Southeast Nigeria. A high species diversity of Cyclopidae in Nigeria: 5 species of Tropocyclops, 5 species of Mesocyclops and 2 species of Thermocyclops from Cyclopidae were identified in 15 populations. Moreover, we detected 18 unique haplotypes, which fell into two distinct clades. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-distances) among the species of Cyclopidae ranged from 0.05 to 0.257. Several species co-existed in the same lake, and some haplotypes were shared among different geographic populations, suggesting a dispersal of Cyclopidae in our sampling region. Finally, we found that the population genetic diversity for each species of Cyclopidae was low in Nigeria. Conclusions Our findings explored the species diversity and distribution of copepods within the family Cyclopidae for 15 Nigerian freshwater ecosystems: a high species diversity of Cyclopidae copepods was detected over a small geographic sampling range. Results from this study contribute to a better understanding of copepod diversity of Nigerian freshwater ecosystems.

Since early 2020, the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has increased the use of PPCP's, so the occurrence and impact of TCS on freshwater lakes should be considered. However, little attention has been given to the effect of TCS on freshwater lakes in China. This study is the first attempt at a risk assessment focusing on the temporal and spatial occurrence of TCS in freshwater lakes in the middle Yangtze River basin. The surface water and sediments of Donghu Lake and Liangzi Lake (Wuhan, Central China) were collected from October 2020 to August 2021. The maximum concentrations of TCS were 466 ng/L and 239 ng/L in surface water, 71 ng/g and 25 ng/g (dry weight) in sediments of Donghu Lake and Liangzi Lake, respectively. Significant temporal and spatial differences of TCS were observed within and between the lakes, with the highest concentrations measured in winter. Furthermore, higher concentrations of TCS were observed in areas that are more impacted by human activities. There was a significant positive correlation between TCS and nitrogen in the surface water. A risk assessment using the risk quotient (RQ) method showed that a potentially high risk (RQ > 1) was found only in surface waters from Donghu Lake, and that the sediments posed a lower risk than the surface waters. These results provide timely data on the temporal and spatial occurrence of TCS in freshwater lakes in China following the outbreak of COVID-19 and demonstrate a possible high risk of exposure to TCS for aquatic biota.

The RP is a mostly massive fall deposit with an inversely graded base. Empirical models suggest a maximum eruption column height HT of 30.5-35 km with an associated peak mass discharge rate of 2.8-4.8x10(8) kg/s. Analytical calculations result in HT values of 33 +/- 4 km (inversion of TEPHRA2 model on grain size data) corresponding to mass discharge ranging from 2.3 to 6.0 x 10(8) kg/s. Lake-core data allow extrapolation of the deposit thinning trend far beyond onland exposures. Empirical fitting of thickness data yields volume estimates between 3.2 and 5.8 km(3) (corresponding to an erupted mass of 1.1-2.0 x 10(12) kg), whereas analytical derivation yields an erupted mass of 1.1x10(12) kg (inversion of TEPHRA2 model). Modelling and dispersal maps are consistent with nearly no-wind conditions during the eruption. The plume corner is estimated to have been ca. 11-12 km from the vent. After an opening phase with gradually increasing intensity, a high discharge rate was maintained throughout the eruption, without fountain collapse as is evidenced by a lack of pyroclastic density current deposits.

Average population density at these sites declined from a maximum of .apprx. 1400 to a minimum of .apprx. 350 individuals/m2 (3.4-0.4 g m-2 dry wt) during the study, possibly as a result of emigration into peripheral vegetation inundated by rising lake levels. Shrimps bred perennially and, although egg stocks and instantaneous birth rates (b) were highest during summer, no corresponding increases in population density were observed, suggesting that the seasonally higher birth rates were offset by higher mortality rates. Population size structure and size-specific sex ratios did not change seasonally to any marked extent. Relative abundance declined with size, and females grew larger than males. Clutch size increased linearly as a function of female carapace length. Estimates of overall mean annual somatic production (g m-2 yr-1 dry wt) between .apprx. 132 (egg-ratio method), 37.5 (summation of growth increments) and 24 (Hynes-Hamilton method) at an annual mean standing stock level of 2.7 g m-2 dry wt (calorific value, 20.34 kJ g-1 dry wt). Production at sites 1, 2 and 3 decreased in line with declining annual mean standing stocks (5.32, 3.67 and 0.23 g m-2, respectively). The growth increment method gave an overall mean annual P/B [biomass] value of 13.9. Egg production amounted to a further 5.6, 3.6 and 0.1 g m-2 yr-1 dry wt (calorific value, 28.01 kJ g-) at sites 1, 2 and 3, or 2.7 g m-2 yr-1 on average.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	6					531	547		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01284.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01284.x													WOS:A1981MP65100004
J	Doskey, PV				Doskey, PV			The air-water exchange of C15-C31 n-alkanes in a precipitation-dominated seepage lake	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The air-water exchange of semivolatile II-alkanes in Crystal Lake, a small precipitation-dominated seepage lake in northern Wisconsin, was investigated with modeling and mass balance approaches, The results suggest that atmospheric deposition contributes approximately 80% of the allochthonous input of il-alkanes to Crystal Lake. Atmospheric deposition accounts for about 50% of the total annual input of n-alkanes to Crystal Lake, and an additional 30% is contributed by in situ production of planktonic n-alkanes (Sigma C-15, C-17, C-19) Contributions to the particle dry flux of terrestrial n-alkanes (Sigma C-25. C-27, C-29, C-31) by pine pollen dispersal and by dry deposition of particles containing leaf waxes are similar in magnitude and constitute about 60% of the atmospheric input, with particle wet deposition being responsible for the remainder. Approximately 30% of the atmospheric input of the il-alkanes occurs during a two-week episode of pine pollen dispersal in spring. Concentration gradients between gaseous, n-alkanes in the atmosphere and dissolved n-alkanes in the water column of Crystal Lake favor volatilization of n-alkanes from the lake surface; however, distributions of dissolved n-alkanes are characteristic of bacteria, and therefore are contained in organic matter and not available for air-water exchange. The estimated net atmospheric input of terrestrial n-alkanes is about 20% less than the settling sediment flux, Additional allochthonous sources of the terrestrial n-alkanes might include diffuse surface runoff or episodes of coarse-particle deposition. The discrepancies in the results from the modeling and mass balance approaches indicate that direct measurements of air-water exchange rates and measurements of the seasonal variations of particle size distributions in air and rain would greatly improve our ability to quantify air-water exchange rates of n-alkanes.

Convergent human and climate forcing of late-Holocene flooding in Northwest England	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Concern is growing that climate change may amplify global flood risk but short hydrological data series hamper hazard assessment. Lake sediment reconstructions are capturing a fuller picture of rare, high-magnitude events but the UK has produced few lake palaeoflood records. We report the longest lake-derived flood reconstruction for the UK to date, a 1500-year record from Brotherswater, northwest England. Its catchment is well-suited physiographically to palaeoflood research, but its homogeneous, dark brown sediment matrix precludes visual identification of flood layers. Instead, an outlier detection routine applied to high-resolution particle size measurements showed a > 90% match, in stratigraphic sequence, to measured high river flows. Our lateHolocene palaeoflood reconstruction reveals nine multi-decadal periods of more frequent flooding (510-630 CE, 890-960, 990-1080, 1470-1560, 1590-1620, 1650-1710, 1740-1770, 1830-1890 and 1920-2012), and these show a significant association with negative winter North Atlantic Oscillation (wNAO) phasing and some synchrony with solar minima. These flood-rich episodes also overlap with local and regional land-use intensification, which we propose has amplified the flood signal by creating a more efficient catchment sediment conveyor and more rapid hillslope-channel hydrological connectivity. Disentangling anthropogenic and climatic drivers is a challenge but anthropogenic landscape transformation should evidently not be underestimated in palaeoflood reconstructions. Our paper also demonstrates that flood histories can be extracted from the numerous lakes worldwide containing organic-rich, visually homogeneous sediments. This transformative evidence base should lead to more reliable assessments of flood frequency and risks to ecosystems and infrastructure.

Phytoplankton and zooplankton, as crucial elements of the aquatic ecosystem, have their distribution patterns evaluated and potential influencing factors identified, thereby enhancing the understanding of community distribution patterns. Nested structures and interspecies interaction relationships bear significant implications for community distribution patterns, functions, and stability. The upstream section of the Diannong River in Yinchuan City was chosen as the study object. Water samples were collected in January, April, July, and October 2021, and the community composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton was analyzed using relative abundance, density, and biomass. The distribution matrix temperature and bipartite network methodologies were deployed to investigate their nested pattern and interaction network seasonal characteristics. The findings indicate that the water environment of the Diannong River's upstream section displays pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, characterized by weak alkalinity and high fluoride content. The plankton community composition and relative abundance showed marked differences among the distinct sampling periods. The temperature of the random distribution matrix shows a significant difference compared to the zero-sum model, revealing a notable nested pattern in plankton in the Diannong River's upstream section. The bipartite network suggests that the plankton composition was the simplest in January and the most complex in July, with the fiercest species competition observed in January and the lowest levels of species specificity, vulnerability, and generality. Water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), CODCr, F-, and Cl- constitute the environmental parameters influencing the overall structure of the phytoplankton community in the Diannong River's upstream section, whereas zooplankton did not present a significant correlation with water environmental factors.						, Junjie Meng/0009-0009-7036-7856; Qiu, Xiaocong/0000-0001-9691-9131														2073-4441				DEC	2023	15	24							4265	10.3390/w15244265	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15244265													WOS:001136139800001

A.; Warner, Barry G.; Asada, Taro; Douabul, Ali			An assessment of vegetation and environmental controls in the 1970s of the Mesopotamian wetlands of southern Iraq	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												A vast ecosystem of wetlands and lakes once covered the Mesopotamian Plain of southern Iraq. Widespread drainage in the 1990s nearly obliterated both components of the landscape. This paper reports the results of a study undertaken in 1972-1975 on the vegetation of the wetlands prior to drainage and provides a unique baseline for gauging future restoration of the wetland ecosystems in Mesopotamia. Five representative study sites were used to assess the flora, three of which were wetlands. A total of 371 plant species were recorded in the five sites, of which approximately 40% represent obligate or facultative wetland species. The wetland vegetation was classified into five major physiognomic forms (submerged, floating, herbaceous tall emergent, herbaceous low emergent and woody low emergent), which was further subdivided into 24 fresh and halophytic communities. Water levels greatly fluctuated across the different types of wetlands, and mean surface water depth ranged from below to greater than 2 m above the sediment surface, reflecting permanently, seasonally or intermittently wet habitats. Aboveground biomass was also highly variable among the communities. The Phragmites australis community, which was the most extensive community type, had the greatest biomass with an average value of approximately 5,000 g m(-2) in summer. Distribution and community composition were largely controlled by water levels and saline-freshwater gradients. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that salinity and water depth were the most important factors to explain species distribution. Environmental variables related to soil salinity separated halophytic species in woody low emergent and herbaceous low emergent forms (Tamarix galica, Cressa cretica, Alhagi mannifera, Aeluropus lagopoides, Juncus rigida, and Suaeda vermiculata) from other species. Their habitats were also the driest, and soil organic matter content was lower than those of other species. Habitats with deepest water were dominated by submerged aquatic and floating leaved species such as Nymphoides peltata, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Najas armata. Such diverse environmental conditions in the Mesopotamian wetland would be greatly affected by evapotranspiration, river water inputs from north, ground water inputs, local soil conditions, and a tide or seiche-controlled northward transgression of water from the Gulf. These environmental conditions should be considered in restoration plans if plant communities existed in the mid-1970s are to be part of the desired restoration goals.

The test results showed that, after soaking for 2160 days, the corrosion current density i(corr) was 7.88 mu A/cm(2), and R-C was 113.51 omega for group A and i(corr) is 0.08 mu A/cm(2) and R-C is 842.57 omega for group B. The time parameters for groups A and B fell in the high-frequency range of 10(3)-10(5) Hz and low-frequency range of 10(-2) to 10(-1) Hz. The relative dynamic moduli of the elasticity evaluation parameters omega(1) and omega(2) were 0.942 and 0.959 and 0.946 and 0.962 for groups A and B, respectively, at 2160 days, exhibiting a downward trend on the whole. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and microscopic testing revealed that the corrosion of the chloride solution on asphalt was mainly the corrosion of chloride in the interior of the asphalt and that the invaded salt provided a channel for the water solution to invade into the interior.

Predation by D. villosus on native benthic invertebrates is assumed as the key determinant of its ecological impact, yet available information describe the species as a primary consumer as well as a carnivore depending on local conditions. Here, we assessed the trophic position (TP) of D. villosus in Lake Trasimeno, a recently invaded lentic system in central Italy, using the CN isotopic signatures of individuals captured in winter spanning two orders of magnitude in body size. TP estimations were compared with those characterizing the native amphipod Echinogammarus veneris and other representative invertebrate predators. On average, D. villosus showed a trophic position higher than E. veneris, and comparable with that of odonate nymphs. An in-depth analysis revealed that large-sized individuals had a trophic position of 3.07, higher than odonates and close to that of the hirudinean predator Erpobdella octoculata, while small-sized specimens had a trophic position of 2.57, similar to that of E. veneris (2.41). These findings indicate that size-related ontogenetic shifts in dietary habits may per se vary the nature of the interaction between Dikerogammarus villosus and native invertebrates from competition to predation. Information collated from published isotopic studies corroborated the generality of our results. We conclude that intra-specific trophic flexibility may potentially amplify and make more multifaceted the impact of the species on other invertebrate species in invaded food webs.					mancinelli, giorgio/A-7679-2013; Mancinelli, Giorgio/A-7679-2013; Ludovisi, Alessandro/G-1973-2014	mancinelli, giorgio/0000-0002-5833-7322; Mancini, Francesco/0000-0003-3446-5343													1387-3547	1573-1464				JUN	2021	23	6					1803	1817		10.1007/s10530-021-02472-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02472-0		FEB 2021											WOS:000619702900001
J	Tangen, BA; Butler, MG; Michael, JE				Tangen, BA; Butler, MG; Michael, JE			Weak correspondence between macroinvertebrate assemblages and land use in Prairie Pothole Region wetlands, USA	WETLANDS												To evaluate the potential development of a macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for Prairie Pothole Region wetlands, we sampled the aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish communities in 24 semipermanent wetlands located throughout central North Dakota. Wetland basins were selected to encompass a range of surrounding land-use, ranging from 100% grassland to 100% cropland. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the influences of fish, and temporal and spatial variation on the macroinvertebrate community. We also used RDA to look for relationships between wetland macroinvertebrate communities and land-use. Seventeen potential invertebrate metrics were tested by graphical analyses. We identified a strong influence on the macroinvertebrate community due to the presence of fish. A number of invertebrate taxa decreased in abundance as the summer progressed, and there was noticeable variation in the invertebrate community among individual wetlands of the region. However, we detected no strong relationships between the varying degrees of agricultural land-use in the wetland catchments and the invertebrate community. Consequently, we were unable to identify any effective IBI metrics indicative of land-use disturbance. Lack of correspondence between land-use and macroinvertebrates in this habitat is most likely due to a high degree of natural disturbance (e.g., presence of fish, temporal changes) and a low diversity community of resilient taxa in Prairie Pothole Region wetlands.

Wind and buoyancy driven horizontal exchange in shallow embayments of a tropical reservoir: Lake Argyle, Western Australia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Many factors including depth, vegetation density, wind, and gyres may act to influence the littoral exchange in a water body but very few studies have investigated the interaction between more than two of these factors at any time. To investigate these controls on horizontal exchange in a large tropical reservoir, we conducted a 9-d intensive field experiment in Lake Argyle, Western Australia. The experiment began with a 7-d cooling period that generated water in the shallows of the reservoir embayments that was persistently cooler than the interior. This led to an underflow of dense water that moved from the lake boundary toward the center of the reservoir. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) was able to adequately reproduce this thermal structure and was used to demonstrate its sensitivity to wind-sheltering effects and submerged macrophyte presence. Further analysis of the predictions indicated that when the ratio of the shear and buoyancy force, averaged over 6 h (B-6h) and 6-h averaged wind speed in the direction of the embayment (U-6h) was (1) greater than 0.5 ms(-1) and 4.5 ms(-1) respectively, the exchange was dominated by a topographic gyre formation, (2) when 0.1 < B-6h < 0.5 and 2.4 ms(-1) < U-6h < 4.5 ms(-1), the resulting circulation was a combination of differential cooling flows and a topographic gyre circulation, and (3) when U-6h fell below 2.4 ms(-1), purely buoyancy driven flow occurred but only if the buoyancy forces across the embayments were an order of magnitude greater than wind-induced velocity shear.

J	Dong, Q; Chen, X; Chen, TX				Dong, Quan; Chen, Xing; Chen, Tiexi			Characteristics and Changes of Extreme Precipitation in the Yellow-Huaihe and Yangtze-Huaihe Rivers Basins, China	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Many works suggest that the intensity of extreme precipitation might be changing under the background of global warming. Because of the importance of extreme precipitation in the Yellow-Huaihe and Yangtze-Huaihe River basins of China and to compare the spatial difference, the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) function is used to fit the daily precipitation series in these basins and an estimate of the extreme precipitation spatial distribution is presented. At the same time, its long-term trends are estimated for the period between 1951 and 2004 by using a generalized linear model (GLM), which is based on GPD. High quality daily precipitation data from 215 observation stations over the area are used in this study. The statistical significance of the trend fields is tested with a Monte Carlo experiment based on a two-dimensional Hurst coefficient, H-2. The spatial distribution of the shape parameter of GPD indicates that the upper reaches of the Huaihe River (HuR) basin have the largest probability of extreme rainfall events, which is consistent with most historical flood records in this region. Spatial variations in extreme precipitation trends are found and show significant positive trends in the upper reaches of Poyang Lake in the Yangtze River (YaR) basin and a significant negative trend in the mid-to lower reaches of the Yellow River (YeR) and Haihe River (HaR) basins. The trends in the HuR basin and the lower reaches of Poyang Lake in the YaR basin are nearly neutral. All trend fields are significant at the 5% level of significance from the Monte Carlo experiments.

The FAs analysis was performed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The potential relationships between FAs and micro-organisms were tested through redundancy analysis (RDA) which allowed to keep all physico-chemical factors constant, including salinity. The results showed a great diversity of FAs from 10 to 24 carbon atoms, which Could be saturated, unsaturated, linear or branched. The predominant saturated FAs were 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0, and might originate from diatoms, Dinophyceae and flagellates for the first ponds and from Chlorophyceae, heterotrophic bacteria (HB) in hypersaline ponds. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid, DHA: docosahexaenoic acid) were detected in small quantities. The branched fatty acids (18:0 12Me or 18:2 12Me) might be attributed primarily to bacteria and archea. Species richness and abundance of aquatic microorganisms decreased as the salt concentration increased, while dominant FAs profiles were overall similar along the salinity gradient.

Many studies have attempted to accurately quantify the rainfall-water level elevation relationship in freshwater bodies so as to predict flooding and drought events. For this purpose several types of models have been implemented including distributed, black box and conceptual models that often provide efficient results, depending on the availability of reliable data as well as on the level of understanding of the system. Nevertheless, in the particular effort, three different models have been used to describe the relationship between rainfall and water level elevation in Trichonis Lake during the period 1951-1997. A Transfer Function model, a Dynamic Linear Regression and a physically based model, consisting of the lake's water budget equation, its Digital Bathymetric Model and GIS algorithms. These models have been tested to assess their efficiency and applicability in a karstic environment and the aim of the study was to find the best modeling option for developing sustainable water management plans and establishing a flooding/drought warning system in the particular lake catchment. The results indicated that in areas with geologically complex conditions, simple, physically-based models operate better than mechanistic models which usually cannot describe adequately the complexity of the system.

J	Jones, I; George, G; Reynolds, C				Jones, I; George, G; Reynolds, C			Quantifying effects of phytoplankton on the heat budgets of two large limnetic enclosures	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The aestival heat budgets of two large limnetic enclosures within a small lake in the English Lake District were studied. During summer, these enclosures had different nutrient supplies and consequently different phytoplankton populations. 2. As initial temperature profiles were similar and the incoming surface heat and momentum fluxes for the two enclosures were identical, subsequent changes in the heat budget were assumed to be induced by the biological differences between the enclosures. The proposed mechanism is an increased surface absorption of solar radiation leading to extra surface warming and a consequent excess loss of heat to the atmosphere through long-wave emittance and sensible and latent heat fluxes, conservatively estimated to be of the order of 10-30 W m(-2). 3. Theoretical calculations show that potential effects on a heat budget could be considerably larger than those observed here. The inherent non-linearity of the heat fluxes implies that such effects will be more important in warmer lakes than in colder ones. 4. Thermocline depth and strength were also altered by the response to differences in phytoplankton. 5. Any changes in climate or in nutrient loading from the catchment which substantially affect abundance or timing of phytoplankton populations in a lake will consequently also change the thermal structure of the lake.

J	Bradley, RS; Diaz, HF				Bradley, Raymond S.; Diaz, Henry F.			Late Quaternary Abrupt Climate Change in the Tropics and Sub-Tropics: The Continental Signal of Tropical Hydroclimatic Events (THEs)	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												Tropical hydroclimatic events, characterized by extreme regional rainfall anomalies, were a recurrent feature of marine isotope stages 2-4 and involved some of the most abrupt and dramatic climatic changes in the late Quaternary. These anomalies were pervasive throughout the tropics and resulted from the southward displacement of the Hadley circulation and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and its associated convective rainfall, modulated by regional factors. Lake sediments, stalagmites, and offshore marine sediments that integrate inland continental conditions provide a comprehensive record of these changes over the past similar to 70,000 yr. Vast areas experienced severe drought while other areas recorded greatly increased rainfall. Within the uncertainties of dating, these tropical rainfall anomalies occurred very close in time (+/- 10(2)-10(3) yr) to the deposition of North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (IRD) that defines Heinrich events (HEs). The IRD record is a good proxy for the amount and distribution of additional freshwater forcing which was necessary to bring about a drastic reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength during each HE. As a consequence of this reduction in AMOC and an abrupt expansion in the area of sea-ice, cooling of the North Atlantic and adjacent continents took place, with a rapid atmospheric response involving the southward displacement of the ITCZ and associated rainfall belts. The climatic consequences of this large-scale change in the Hadley circulation, modulated by regional factors, is clearly recorded throughout the tropics as a series of abrupt and extreme hydroclimatic events. Some of the physical mechanisms that may have played a role in those changes are discussed.

Temporal changes in cladoceran assemblages subjected to a low calcium environment: combining the sediment record with long-term monitoring data	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakewater calcium (Ca) decline affects softwater lakes across the Canadian Shield. Ca decline is one consequence of acid deposition, and has impeded biological recovery in formerly acidified lakes. Reduced Ca availability may advantage taxa better adapted to low Ca waters. Crosson Lake in south-central Ontario (Canada) has an extensive monitoring record and has experienced strong Ca decline since the late 1970s, recently falling below 1.5 mg L-1, a threshold value for some large Daphnia O.F. Muller, 1785 taxa. Paleolimnological analysis of the sedimentary cladoceran assemblages revealed that changes associated with the Ca decline began in the early 1970s. Relative abundances of the jelly-clad Holopedium glacialis Rowe, 2007 and the Daphnia pulex complex increased while Ca-sensitive members of the Daphnia longispina complex decreased. Zooplankton net hauls (1981-2010) corroborate the paleolimnological analysis, revealing that increases in the D. pulex complex were due to Daphnia catawba Coker, 1926 (a taxon tolerant of low Ca). Lakewater Ca, dissolved organic carbon and total phosphorus explain a significant amount of variation within the cladoceran community; however, the relationship between Ca concentration and the daphniid community was most apparent. The Crosson Lake paleolimnological and direct monitoring data may describe ecological changes that are also occurring in many other softwater lakes across the Canadian Shield and elsewhere.

Effects of rapid urbanization on streamflow, erosion, and sedimentation in a desert stream in the American Southwest	ANTHROPOCENE												Rapid urbanization has resulted in a series of sequential effects on a desert stream in the American Southwest. Lower Las Vegas Wash was a dry wash characterized by infrequent flood deposition when Las Vegas, Nevada was established in 1905. Wastewater effluent was discharged into the wash in low volumes for over 3 decades. Wastewater volumes increased commensurably with accelerated population growth during the late 20th century and created a sequence of feedback effects on the floodplain. Initially slow saturation of the valley fill created a desert oasis of dense floodplain vegetation and wetlands. Annual streamflow began in 1958 and erosion began a decade later with shallow incision in discontinuous channel segments. Increasing baseflow gradually enlarged channels; headcutting was active during the 1970s to 1984. The incised channels concentrated storm runoff, which accelerated local channel erosion, and in 1984 the headcuts were integrated during a series of monsoon floods. Wetlands were drained and most floodplain vegetation destroyed. Channel erosion continued unabated until engineering interventions began in the 21st century. No natural channel recovery occurred after initial urbanization effects because streamflow never stabilized in the late 20th century. A 6.6 M m(3) sediment slug, eroded from the wash in similar to 25 years, was deposited in Las Vegas Bay in Lake Mead. Falling reservoir levels during the 21st century are responsible for sediment redistribution and infilling of the bay. Close monitoring of impacts is recommended when urban wastewater and storm runoff are discharged on a desert wash. Channel interventions, when necessary, are advised in order to prevent costly engineering schemes of channel stabilization, flood control, and floodplain restoration.

This study applied an integrated method (statistical analysis, water table fluctuation method, hydrograph analysis and remote sensing) to identify the impact of Energy Base Water Project on the groundwater in the Subei Lake basin. Groundwater levels in eight observation wells at 30 min intervals during the 2013-2014 period were monitored using automatic groundwater monitoring data loggers. Results showed that precipitation infiltration, irrigation return flow, groundwater pumping and evapotranspiration controlled the hydrodynamics of unconfined groundwater. The average evapotranspiration rates in the Quaternary phreatic aquifer and the Cretaceous phreatic aquifer were 6.15 and 12.48 mm/d. The unusual hourly hydrographs fall into three patterns (mutational, irregular and gradual hydrographs). Different recovery times after being influenced by pumping may be related to the presence of the mudstone lenses. The extent of the groundwater depression cone was qualitatively identified by gradual hydrographs, which may spread from the center area to the western boundary. Only some individual wells from Haolebaoji waterworks had conducted the intermittent pumping activities at random times and caused the decline of the lakes.					; Han, Dongmei/ABB-7007-2021; Zhang, Yinghua/A-3436-2019; Ma, Ying/KDN-1740-2024; FEI, LIU/KFT-1618-2024; Bu, Hongmei/AID-3966-2022	Liu, Fei/0000-0003-0967-9112; 													1998-9563	2224-7955				FEB	2017	48	1					160	176		10.2166/nh.2016.222	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.222													WOS:000394429300011

However, limited information about the characteristics of AOA and AOB in the river ecosystem is available. The distribution and abundance of AOA and AOB in the sediments of the Dongjiang River, a drinking water source for Hong Kong, were investigated by clone library analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Group 1.1b- and Group 1.1b-associated sequences of AOA predominated in sediments with comparatively high carbon and nitrogen contents (e. g. total carbon (TC) >13 g kg(-1) sediment, NH4+-N >144 mg kg(-1) sediment), while Group 1.1a- and Group 1.1a-associated sequences were dominant in sediments with opposite conditions (e. g. TC <4 g kg(-1) sediment, NH4+-N <93 mg kg(-1) sediment). Although Nitrosomonas-and Nitrosospira-related sequences of AOB were detected in the sediments, nearly 70% of the sequences fell into the Nitrosomonas-like B cluster, suggesting similar sediment AOB communities along the river. Higher abundance of AOB than AOA was observed in almost all of the sediments in the Dongjiang River, while significant correlations were only detected between the distribution of AOA and the sediment pH and TC, which suggested that AOA responded more sensitively than AOB to variations of environmental factors. These results extend our knowledge about the environmental responses of ammonia oxidizers in the river ecosystem.

Most of the foragers are small (similar to 3.0-5.0 mm), but similar to 10% of the ants seen foraging are much larger (similar to 7.0 mm) and may form a soldier caste. Foragers are thermophilic and show diurnal activity, displaying a single-peaked activity profile across the day, with activity time limited to 2-6 h at most each day (during the late-summer study period, 28 February to 28 March 2012). They forage largely for dead arthropods, but also occasionally bring home plant materials. Foraging success (not considering possible liquid food intake) is similar to 20%, resembling the success rate of their congener Melophorus bagoti, which inhabits cluttered environments. When displaced with food from a feeder, the ants head systematically and precisely in the feeder-to-nest direction, thus exhibiting path integration abilities involving celestial compass cues. The study of this species provides an interesting comparative perspective in contrasting desert ants of the same genus and thus genetic heritage inhabiting habitats differing in complexity of panoramic terrestrial cues as well as comparing ecologically similar species inhabiting the same type of habitat (in the present case, salt-pans) but differing in their phylogenetic relationships.					; Schultheiss, Patrick/AAC-9463-2019; cheng, ken/NOE-5004-2025	Cheng, Ken/0000-0002-4913-2691; Schultheiss, Patrick/0000-0002-6906-3507; Schwarz, Sebastian/0000-0002-6327-6181; 													0004-959X	1446-5698					2012	60	5					311	319		10.1071/ZO12096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO12096													WOS:000317419100004

Natural assemblages of phytoplankton from a low-pH, low-Al lake (Franklin Lake, WI) were grown in semi-continuous cultures consisting of four treatments at pH 5.7 with 0.0, 50, 100, and 200 .mu.g Al L-1 and one treatment at pH 4.7 with no Al added. Asterionella ralfsii var. americana (a common diatom plankter in acidic lakes) grew well at both pH 4.7 and 5.7 when no Al was added but declined in all other treatments and so may be useful as an indicator of acidic, low monomeric-Al conditions. Other common plankters that showed this pattern included: Arthrodesmus indentatus, Ar. octocornus, Ar. quiriferus, Staurastrum arachne var. curvatum, S. longipes var. contractum, and S. pentacerum. Common taxa showing no toxic effects of Al were Dinobryon bavaricum, Peridinium limbatum, Stenokalyx monilifera, Elakatothrix sp. and Oedogonium sp. We hypothesize that metal toxicity as a pulse at spring snowmelt could dramatically change algal succession in moderately acidic lakes. The experimental results agreed well with field observations. These types of experiments are useful for predicting the responses of natural phytoplankton communities to increases in Al concentration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 23	1990	194	3					225	233		10.1007/BF00007122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007122													WOS:A1990DB76400006

Toward more accurate estimates of carbon emissions from small reservoirs	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Because of their abundance and high emissions rates, small reservoirs (< 0.01 km(2)) can be important emitters of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. However, emissions estimates from small reservoirs have lagged those of larger ones, and efforts to characterize small reservoir emissions have largely overlooked variations in emissions pathways, times, and locations. We intensively sampled four small reservoirs in Georgia, USA, during the summer to quantify the contribution and spatiotemporal variability of different emissions pathways (CO2 and CH4 diffusion, CH4 ebullition). We used these data to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of different sampling schemes. Every emissions pathway was dominant in one reservoir on one sampling day, and excluding ebullition caused misestimation between -89% and -15% of the total flux. Sampling only once daily caused misestimation between -78% and 45%, but sampling twice or just after dawn (07:00 h) reduced error. Sampling four or fewer locations caused misestimation between -85% and 366%, and our results indicated that 6-20 sampling locations may be needed for reasonable accuracy. The floating aquatic macrophyte Wolffia sp. (duckweed) appeared to exert control over emissions variability, and the consequences of not accounting for variability were greater in a duckweed-covered reservoir. Our results indicate that sampling only at 10:00 h (modal sampling time of prior efforts) may lead to the erroneous conclusion that reservoirs with high photosynthetic biomass are CO2 sinks rather than sources. Improving estimation accuracy by accounting for within-reservoir variation in emissions will facilitate more strategic management of these abundant, anthropogenic ecosystems.

Concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides (Ra-226, Pb-210 and Po-210) as well as anthropogenic radionuclides (Cs-134 and Cs-137) were measured. This study confirmed that Po-210 is the dominant contributor to radiation doses resulting from fish consumption. While concentrations of Pb-210 and Ra-226 were below conventional detection limits, Po-210 was measured in almost all fish samples collected from the ELA. The average concentration was about 1.5 Bq/kg fresh weight (fw). None of the fish samples analysed in this study contained any detectable levels of Cs-134. An average Cs-137 level of 6.1 Bq/kg fw was observed in freshwater fishes harvested in the ELA, almost twice that of samples measured in the National Capital Region of Canada in 2014 and more than 20 times higher than the levels observed in marine fish harvested from the Canadian west coast in 2013 and 2014. However, it is important to note that the concentrations of Cs-137 in fish samples from these inland lakes are considered very low from a radiological protection perspective. The resulting radiation dose for people from fish consumption would be a very small fraction of the annual dose from exposure to natural background radiation in Canada. The results indicate that fishes from inland lakes do not pose a radiological health concern. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cui, BL; Li, XY				Cui, Bu-Li; Li, Xiao-Yan			Characteristics of stable isotope and hydrochemistry of the groundwater around Qinghai Lake, NE Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The integrated use of isotopic and hydrochemical tracers is an effective approach for investigating complex hydrological processes of groundwater. The stable isotope composition and hydrochemistry of the groundwater around Qinghai Lake were investigated to study the sources and recharge areas. Most of the groundwater points lie close to the local meteoric water line, indicating that the ground waters were recharged primarily from precipitation in the basin, though it had undergone varying degrees of evaporation. The hydrochemical analysis showed that the groundwater was mainly freshwater and that the hydrochemical type was Ca-Mg-HCO3; the results of the boomerang envelope model and solutes calculated indicated that the groundwater chemistry was mainly controlled by carbonate dissolution around Qinghai Lake. The recharge altitudes of groundwater were relatively low (at 3,400 m.a.s.l) on the northern shore of Qinghai Lake (locations G1 and G5), relatively high (above 3,900 m.a.s.l) on the southern shore (locations G3 and G4), and approximately 3,700 m.a.s.l on the western shore (location G2). Furthermore, groundwater samples from the fault zone (e.g., G3) would be recharged in part from fissure or inter-basin water. High salinity of groundwater on the western shore (location G2) was related with the evaporite dissolution, the groundwater is unsuitable for drinking, and the drinking water should be improved and enhanced in this area. Knowledge of our research can promote effective management of water resources in this cold and semiarid region and add new data to global groundwater database.

Samples of fish were taken by Nordic survey gill nets (several mesh sizes from 8 to 70 nun knot to knot) installed as surface nets at several offshore areas located along the longitudinal axis of the reservoir. Surveys were carried out in late summer during 1999-2003. An obvious distribution gradient of fish was revealed along the longitudinal axis of the Rimov Reservoir. The total relative fish abundance and biomass (catch per unit effort) decreased considerably from the upstream end of the reservoir toward the dam. Roach (Rutilus rutilus), bleak (Alburnus alburnus) and bream (Abramis brama) comprised the bulk of catches at all areas. Enhanced dominance of bream was observed in the fish assemblage at the uppermost, more eutrophic area of the reservoir. The highest number of fish species and the highest abundance of young-of-the-year fish were also observed in the tributary area. In the downstream part of the reservoir, gill net surveys along the vertical depth profiles indicated that offshore fish occupied mostly the epilimnion. Extreme flood events affected the Rimov Reservoir, however, it seemed they had no significant impact on the gradients described.					; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Prchalová, Marie/F-8664-2014; Frouzova, Jaroslava/F-8518-2014; Draštík, Vladislav/G-2222-2014; Prchalova, Marie/F-8664-2014; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011	Drastik, Vladislav/0000-0002-9419-6977; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Prchalova, Marie/0000-0001-5000-2918; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854													1434-2944						2004	89	4					352	362		10.1002/iroh.200410734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200410734													WOS:000224251800002

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the contribution of glacier runoff in the Upper Khovd River Basin (UKRB) is limited. This study investigates the impact of glacier recession on the UKRB's hydrology in western Mongolia's Altai Mountains. The analysis included glaciological method measurements, satellite-derived glacier extent records, and a simple ice ablation model. Our modeling used a mass balance gradient of 0.50 meters water equivalent 100 m(-1) for the years 2000, 2010, and 2016 and included a sensitivity analysis that applied lower and upper mass balance gradient values and +/- 200 m around the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). The glacier contribution to the UKRB's water resources decreased from almost 8% in 2000 to 6.7% in 2016. Hypsometries revealed that glacier areas decreased at all elevations, indicating that only small accumulation zones exist. Therefore, applying a modeled increased ELA better represents glacier contribution to total runoff at 18.7% in 2000 and 15.4% in 2016. The decreasing glacier runoff contribution indicates that the UKRB glaciers have passed the tipping point of an increased contribution that first follows enhanced melting. The continued glacier recession and uncertain water availability represent challenges for water resource management and future human-water relations in the Mongolian Altai.					; Kamp, Ulrich/JHT-1734-2023; Avirmed, Dashtseren/AAO-5371-2020	Avirmed, Dashtseren/0000-0003-4119-5345; Kamp, Ulrich/0000-0003-2923-0662													0276-4741	1994-7151				MAY	2019	39	2					R12	R20		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-18-00059.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-18-00059.1													WOS:000502976000006
J	Olson, MH; Hage, MM; Binkley, MD; Binder, JR				Olson, MH; Hage, MM; Binkley, MD; Binder, JR			Impact of migratory snow geese on nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in a freshwater reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined impacts of nutrient loading, particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus, from greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) on a reservoir in south-eastern Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Approximately 100 000 geese use the reservoir for 2-6 weeks prior to their spring migration northward. 2. We estimated the magnitude of nutrient loading by geese during their presence and compared that to surface input and output rates. We also conducted nutrient limitation bioassay experiments to examine patterns of algal nutrient limitation upstream and downstream of the reservoir. 3. During their presence from 1 February to 27 March 2001, snow geese contributed 85-93% of the phosphorus and 33-44% of the nitrogen loaded to the reservoir. Both nutrients were exported from the reservoir slowly rather than as a quick pulse. Consequently, phosphorus concentrations in the outflow were higher than in the inflow from February to the end of July. However, nitrogen concentrations were consistently lower in the outflow than the inflow. 4. Nutrient limitation bioassays conducted in June and July indicated that primary production in the outflow was limited by nitrogen whereas the inflow was co-limited by nitrogen and phosphorus. Further downstream from the reservoir, primary production was consistently phosphorus limited. Therefore, nitrogen limitation persisted long after the geese had left, but was relatively localised.					; Binder, Jeff/CAJ-3303-2022	Hage, Melissa/0000-0001-9601-8202; 													0046-5070					MAY	2005	50	5					882	890		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01367.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01367.x													WOS:000228690300012

Lac Lili (unofficial name) is located in the boreal forest of western Quebec, Canada, and was chosen for its shallowness (z(max) = 1.40 m) to assess if chironomid assemblages in the sediments could be used to reconstruct Holocene temperature fluctuations quantitatively. Inferred temperatures displayed a decreasing trend from a maximum value ca. 8000-3500 cal year BP, slight warming between ca. 3500 and 3000 cal year BP, followed by cooling to the present. Although chironomid assemblages were influenced by factors other than climate, primarily water depth and changes in macrophyte richness, the reconstructed Holocene temperature pattern was very similar to the known regional climate history. Temperature inferences derived from the chironomid assemblages were, however, warmer than the two reference periods. This deviation was likely a consequence of three factors: (1) shallowness of the lake, which favoured littoral taxa with warmer-than-today temperature optima, (2) the low number of lakes warmer than 16 A degrees C in the training set, and (3) the absence of shallow lakes in the training set.

Except for those of the buteos (red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk and broad-winged hawk), all the eggs examined contained high, but variable, DDE levels. Values in eggs of the red-tailed hawk ranged from .apprx. 2-14 ppm, and those for other buteos fell within this span. Eggs of the screeh owl, American kestrel and Cooper''s hawk contained intermediate mean residue levels (12-67 ppm). The highest mean DDE level and the highest DDE level in an individual egg were exhibited by the great horned owl (102 and 248, respectively). Limited data on residues are also presented for dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide and PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls]. Data on eggshell thinning indicated that there had been little decrease in shell thickness for eggs of the buteos, while for eggs of the great horned owl and American kestrel shell thickness had decreased about 10%. The Copper''s hawk exhibited the greatest increase in the degree of eggshell thinning (19%), and its situation may be critical. The ecological factors responsible for residue differences between hawk-owl counterparts are discussed.																			0028-7210						1978	25	2					121	128																WOS:A1978HD25000003

Quaternary slip rates on the White Mountains fault zone, eastern California: Implications for comparing geologic to geodetic slip rates across the Walker Lane	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The White Mountains fault zone in eastern California is a major fault system that accommodates right-lateral shear across the southern Walker Lane. We combined field geomorphic mapping and interpretation of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models with Be-10 cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages to calculate new late Pleistocene and Holocene right-lateral slip rates on the White Mountains fault zone. Alluvial fans were found to have ages of 46.6 + 11.0/-10.0 ka and 7.3 + 4.2/-4.5 ka, with right-lateral displacements of 65 +/- 13 m and 14 +/- 5 m, respectively, yielding a minimum average slip rate of 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm/yr. These new slip rates help to resolve the kinematics of fault slip across this part of the complex Pacific-North American plate boundary. Our results suggest that late Pleistocene slip rates on the White Mountains fault zone were significantly faster than previously reported. These results also help to reconcile a portion of the observed discrepancy between modern geodetic strain rates and known late Pleistocene slip rates in the southern Walker Lane. The total middle to late Pleistocene slip rate from the southern Walker Lane near 37.5 degrees N was 7.9 + 1.3/-0.6 mm/yr, similar to 75% of the observed modern geodetic rate.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JAN-FEB	2021	133	1-2					307	324		10.1130/B35332.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35332.1													WOS:000618060000022

We collected a total of 37 taxa (25 living and 12 sub-recent) from 114 of 130 aquatic sites sampled during September of 2011; 34 of the taxa were new records for the region. Eight widely distributed 'cosmopolitan' species (Candona neglecta, Cypridopsis vidua, Heterocypris incongruens, Ilyocypris bradyi, Limnocythere inopinata, Potamocypris villosa, Prionocypris zenkeri, and Psychrodromus olivaceus) were found more frequently than other species. The first two axes of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) explained 73.2% of the correlation between 11 species and 5 environmental variables. Of which, electrical conductivity (F = 3.99, p = 0.028) and altitude (F = 2.69, p = 0.004) were the most explanatory (p < 0.05) variables for species. Optimum altitude and water temperature values of the cosmopolitan species were relatively higher than the other species. Significant regression models (p < 0.01, r(2) = 0.81) indicate that the frequency of occurrence was affected by changes in numbers of samplings sites from 549 to 1457 m. When highest numbers of species (15 spp.) were found at the range of 1231 - 1332 m, numbers of asexual species (10 spp.) were twice of the sexual species (5 spp.) with no statistical difference between numbers of swimming (7 spp.) and non-swimming (8 spp.) species.

Uintah, Utah, year 2005 population 2,000, is studied. As of Fall 2001, this suburb of the Salt Lake City-Ogden urban area featured 12 km of paved roads, 133 traffic signs, 18 street lights, pavement markings, and other transportation infrastructure. A part-time city engineer was responsible for maintaining the transportation and other infrastructure. A formal TIMMS was not in place. A TIMMS emphasizing preventive maintenance on all infrastructure, along with corrective maintenance on all pavements, was estimated to require about 79% of the city engineer's time, at an annual cost of about $88,000, or $7,330/km of road (2002$). About 75% of the expenses would be devoted to pavement preservation. The cost would exceed the city's estimated transport maintenance budget ($55,775) by about 58%, while the time required of the engineer might exceed that available. A simple linear programming TIMMS formulation is developed. One heuristic solution would be to implement a scheduled maintenance program on all transport infrastructure, and corrective pavement maintenance on one major collector street. These two programs would consume the entire $55,775 budget. The budget shortfall may be indicative of a general lack of adequate funding for infrastructure maintenance in the United States. The time shortfall indicates a need for additional manpower. Further study is needed to determine how best to prioritize maintenance actions, optimize maintenance resources, and identify supplemental funding sources.

This study examines the impact of climate change on the hydrological processes of the Ranwu Lake basin in the southeastern Tibet Plateau. The authors used China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) historical data, CanESM5 ' s future climate predictor, and the SPHY model to analyze trends in temperature, precipitation, and water supply sources in the basin. The study found that warming in the basin was higher than that in the Tibet Plateau, with high-altitude areas and winter showing more significant warming. From 1998 to 2018, precipitation in the basin showed a trend of fluctuation and decline. The study also found that glacial meltwater accounted for the majority of total runoff in the basin (54.13%), while snow meltwater, rainfall, and baseflow accounted for about 22.98%, 11.84%, and 11.06%, respectively, on average in recent years. The total runoff in the Ranwu Lake Basin will continue to decrease due to the accelerating retreat of glaciers, with the hydrological process transforming from being dominated by glacier processes to rain-snow processes. The study also predicts that three-quarters of glaciers in the basin will vanish within the next forty years, and by 2100, only around 20% of glaciers will remain.

Ongoing increases in dissolved organic carbon are sustained by decreases in ionic strength rather than decreased acidity in waters recovering from acidic deposition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has received considerable attention in freshwater research, particularly since the early 2000s when increasing trends became apparent. However, remaining questions need to be resolved to address future effects of DOC on surface waters. This study was undertaken to determine (1) the relative importance of acidity and ionic strength in driving DOC increases in waters recovering from acidification and (2) the role played by long-term acid rain effects on soil. Data obtained from temporal and spatial monitoring of 142 headwater streams throughout the Adirondack region of New York (USA) were used to evaluate chemical relationships involving DOC. Year-round monitoring of three streams of differing acidification status were combined with intermittent stream surveys during spring snowmelt throughout this 24,243 km(2) region that is recovering from acidification of soils and surface waters. Despite acidic deposition decreases reaching levels estimated for the early 1900s. DOC concentrations exhibited linear increases from the early 2000s through 2019. Ionic strength or conductivity showed consistent inverse relationships with DOC in all data comparisons from 2004-05 to 2018-19. In contrast, relationships between pH and DOC did not support increasing pH as an important factor in DOC increases. Inconsistent relationships between pH and DOC were due to strongly acidic organic acids that remain unprotonated throughout the pH range of these waters and limited weak-acid deprotonation below pH 62. Decreasing ionic strength increases DOC solubility by expanding the diffuse double layer, which fosters disaggregation of organic matter and dispersion of colloids. This affect controlled DOC solubilization below a pH of approximately 6.2. Distinguishing between ionic strength and pH effects is important because further large reductions in acidic deposition are not expected but continued soil-water dilution is likely from soil-Ca2+ depletion and the decreasing rate of Ca2+ leaching by SO42- and NO3-, which are still being released from soil organic matter.

Evaluation of effectiveness and efficiency of wild bird surveillance for avian influenza	VETERINARY RESEARCH												This study aimed to assess which method of wild waterbird surveillance had the greatest probability of detecting highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 during a period of surveillance activity, the cost of each method was also considered. Lake Constance is a major wintering centre for migratory waterbirds and in 2006 it was the site of an HPAI H5N1 epidemic in wild birds. Avian influenza surveillance was conducted using harmonised approaches in the three countries around the lake, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, from 2006-2009. The surveillance consisted of testing birds sampled by the following methods: live birds caught in traps, birds killed by hunters, birds caught in fishing nets, dead birds found by the public and catching live Mute Swans (Cygnus olor); sentinel flocks of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also used. Scenario tree analysis was performed including sensitivity analysis, followed by assessment of cost-effectiveness. Results indicated that if HPAI H5N1 was present at 1% prevalence and assuming HPAI resulted in bird mortality, sampling dead birds found by the public and sentinel surveillance were the most sensitive approaches despite residual uncertainty over some parameters. The uncertainty over the mortality of infected birds was an influential factor. Sampling birds found dead was most cost-effective, but strongly dependent on mortality and awareness of the public. Trapping live birds was least cost-effective. Based on our results, we recommend that future HPAI H5N1 surveillance around Lake Constance should prioritise sentinel surveillance and, if high mortality is expected, the testing of birds found dead.

J	Enloe, J; O'Brien, JJ; Smith, SR				Enloe, J; O'Brien, JJ; Smith, SR			ENSO impacts on peak wind gusts in the United States	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Changes in the peak wind gust magnitude in association with the warm and cold phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are identified over the contiguous United States. All calculations of the peak wind gust are differences in the extreme phases of ENSO ( warm and cold) relative to neutral for all stations in the study that pass the completeness criteria. Monthly composites were created for all years in the study ( 1 January 1948 through 31 August 1998). The differences in the mean peak wind gust are calculated for each month. A nonparametric statistical test was invoked to determine significant shifts in the extreme phase distributions. Differences in the frequency of gale-force wind gusts were also calculated. The results show a dominant, ENSO cold phase wintertime signal. Regions most greatly affected are the Pacific Northwest, Southwest, the Great Plains, and the region extending from the Great Lakes through the Ohio River valley, and southwest into Texas. During the cold phase months from November to March, these regions experience an overall increase in the gustiness of the winds. The warm phase is associated with overall decreased gustiness in the Pacific Northwest during these months; however, the signal is of a lesser magnitude. There is also an observed decrease in the central Great Plains during the warm phase months of April and June. These results, along with improved ENSO forecasting, can work toward mitigating adverse effects of strong wind gusts and increase the utilization of wind power.

J	CONE, DK				CONE, DK			HENNEGUYA-DOORI GUILFORD, 1963 (MYXOSPORIDA) OF PERCA-FLAVESCENS IN NEW-BRUNSWICK	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Of the P. flavescens collected during winter from Little Magaguadavic Lake, New Brunswick [Canada], 34% were infected with H. doori Guilford, 1963. Cysts were on the primary gill lamellae and formed white nodules (0.5-0.9 mm in size) that contained dense masses of mature spores. Most cysts were in septal tissue near the afferent artery (inflowing blood) and a few were in secondary lamellae. Cysts were absent from septal tissue that surrounded the efferent artery (outflowing blood). Infective trophozoites apparently enter the primary gill lamellae via the afferent and then migrate through the endothelium and develop in the septal tissue. Some infective trophozoites appear to enter secondary lamellae but possibly because of the small diameter of the capillaries do not reach the efferent artery and thus develop in the capillary bed. Mature spores found in the present study are morphologically similar to spores of H. doori described from Lake Michigan. H. doori occupies the same tissue in the same host species as H. percae Fantham, Porter and Richardson, 1939, and spores of the 2 spp. have some morphological similarities. H. doori may be a synonym of H. percae.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1979	57	9					1785	1788		10.1139/z79-232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z79-232								540282					WOS:A1979HT10000011
J	Xiong, J; Li, ZJ				Xiong, Jie; Li, Zijian			Predicting PFAS fate in fish: Assessing the roles of dietary, respiratory, and dermal uptake in bioaccumulation modeling	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												An increasing number of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposed to the environment may pose a threat to organisms and human beings. However, there is a lack of simulations comprehensively addressing and comparing the bioaccumulation of PFAS across all three major exposure routes (oral, inhalation, and dermal), especially for dermal uptake. In this study, we proposed a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for PFAS, aiming to predict bioaccumulation factors (BAF) in fish by considering these diverse exposure routes. 15 PFAS were used for model validation, and 11 PFAS from Taihu Lake were used for exposure contribution modeling. Approximately 64% of estimations fell within 10-fold model bias from measurements in Taihu Lake, underscoring the potential efficacy of the developed PBK model in predicting BAFs for fish. The dermal route emerges as a contributor to short-chain PFAS exposure. For example, it ranged widely from 46% to 75% (mean) for all modeling short-chain PFAS (C6-C7) in Taihu Lake. It indicated the criticality of considering dermal exposure for PFAS in fish, highlighting a gap in field studies to unravel cutaneous intake mechanisms and contributions. For longer carbon chains of PFAS (C8-C12), dermal exposure accounted for 2%-27% for all species of aquatic organisms. The fish's lipid fraction and water content played a significant role in the contribution of PFAS intake through cutaneous exposure and inhalation. K-ow had a significant positive correlation with skin intake rate (p < 0.05) and gill intake rate (p < 0.001), while having a significant negative correlation with skin intake (p < 0.05) and skin intake contribution (p < 0.001). Based on the proposed modeling approach, we have introduced a simulation spreadsheet for projecting PFAS BAFs in fish tissues, hopefully broadening the predictive operational tool for a variety of chemical species.

J	Althouse, B; Higgins, S; Vander Zanden, MJ				Althouse, Bryan; Higgins, Scott; Vander Zanden, M. Jake			Benthic and planktonic primary production along a nutrient gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Primary production in lakes occurs in both planktonic (water column) and benthic (bottom) habitats. How whole-lake primary production is distributed between these 2 habitats-referred to as autotrophic structure-is a key ecosystem property. Empirical research examining the balance between benthic and planktonic primary production in lakes is scarce, and how autotrophic structure changes across depth, nutrient, water clarity, and biological invasion gradients is unclear. Therefore, we are ill equipped to anticipate ecosystem-level responses to environmental change. We assessed the magnitude of offshore planktonic, nearshore planktonic, and nearshore benthic gross primary production (GPP) along a gradient of nutrients, water clarity, and Cladophora biomass in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA, during summer 2010, 2011, and 2012. Benthic and planktonic GPP varied strongly along the trophic gradient. Planktonic GPP increased with nutrients status, whereas benthic GPP decreased. From shore to 10 m depth, autotrophic structure shifted from planktonic dominance near the mouth of the Fox River (95% planktonic) to a mix of benthic and planktonic GPP 35 km from the mouth of the Fox (similar to 40% benthic). The steep bathymetry at more-distant sites reduced the relative importance of benthic GPP at the whole-ecosystem level. Our work highlights the dual-pathway (i.e., benthic and planktonic) nature of lentic food webs from the perspective of GPP, and shows how both trophic status and bathymetry affect autotrophic structure.					; Higgins, Scott/J-2044-2014	Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2014	33	2					487	498		10.1086/676314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/676314													WOS:000337521400010

Size range of yellow perch examined was 72 to 118 mm. In October at a 15-m site off Muskegon, both Gammarus spp. and Isopoda were found in nearly 71% of age-0 yellow perch stomachs,and accounted for 71 and 26% of the diet by weight respectively. The following spring at the 15-m site (June 1999). Gammarus spp. and Isopoda were only a small part of age-1 yellow perch diet, and Chironomidae and Mysis relicta dominated the diet. In October at depths of 25 to 35 m, M. relicta, was found in 100 and 80% of the age-0 yellow perch containing food off Muskegon and St. Joseph, respectively, and comprised over 96% of the diet by weight. Gammarus spp. Isopoda, and M. relicta were eaten in higher numbers than would be expected based on their low abundance in the environment. The high occurrence of Gammarus spp. and Isopoda in yellow perch diet may indicate ongoing changes in the nearshore benthic community.

J	Wirth, SB; Sessions, AL				Wirth, Stefanie B.; Sessions, Alex L.			Plant-wax D/H ratios in the southern European Alps record multiple aspects of climate variability	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a Younger Dryas-Holocene record of the hydrogen isotopic composition of sedimentary plant waxes (delta D-wax) from the southern European Alps (Lake Ghirla, N-Italy) to investigate its sensitivity to climatic forcing variations in this mid-latitude region (45 degrees N). A modern altitudinal transect of delta D values of river water and leaf waxes in the Lake Ghirla catchment is used to test present-day climate sensitivity of delta D-wax While we find that altitudinal effects on delta D-wax are minor at our study site, temperature, precipitation amount, and evapotranspiration all appear to influence delta D-wax to varying extents. In the lake-sediment record, delta D-wax values vary between 134 and 180 parts per thousand over the past 13 kyr. The long-term Holocene pattern of delta D-wax parallels the trend of decreasing temperature and is thus likely forced by the decline of northern hemisphere summer insolation. Shorter-term fluctuations, in contrast, may reflect both temperature and moisture-source changes. During the cool Younger Dryas and Little Ice Age (LIA) periods we observe unexpectedly high delta D-wax values relative to those before and after. We suggest that a change towards a more D-enriched moisture source is required during these intervals. In fact, a shift from northern N-Atlantic to southern N-Atlantic/western Mediterranean Sea sources would be consistent with a southward migration of the Westerlies with climate cooling. Prominent delta D-wax fluctuations in the early and middle Holocene are negative and potentially associated with temperature declines. In the late Holocene (<4 kyr BP), excursions are partly positive (as for the LIA) suggesting a stronger influence of moisture-source changes on delta D-wax variation. In addition to isotopic fractionations of the hydrological cycle, changes in vegetation composition, in the length of the growing season, and in snowfall amount provide additional potential sources of variability, although we cannot yet quantitatively assess these in the paleo-record. We conclude that while our delta D-wax record from the Alps does contain climatic information, it is a complicated record that would require additional constraints to be robustly interpreted. This also has important implications for other water-isotope-based proxy records of precipitation and hydro-climate from this region, such as cave speleothems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to quantify the effect of human activity in 18 lakes located in both side of the France-Spain frontier. Sediment cores were collected in summer 2013, sampled at a 1cm resolution and the concentration of 24 elements was measured by ICP-MS. Statistic and chemometric analysis of the results highlights the influence of the geographical position and lithogenic features of each lake basin on trapping pollutants. More than the 80% of the lakes showed values of enrichment factor (EF) above 2 for at least one of the elements investigated in at least one core interval, which corroborates the existence of historical anthropogenic inputs of elements in the studied area. The results demonstrate the natural origin of As and Ti in Pyrenees, together with the significant anthropogenic inputs of Cd, Pb, Sb and Sn from ancient times. The data set points mining activities as the main historical source of pollution and illustrate the large impact of the industrial revolution. The regional variability could reflect also differential long-range transport, followed by dry or wet deposition.

In the upper lake, the sediment was polluted also with cellulose fiber. Both hypolimnia turned anoxic, but sulfide was detected only in the upper lake. When sulfide appeared, hypolimnetic methyl mercury (MeHg) increased and reached 47 pM (9.4 ng.L-1), whereas MeHg in the sediment below decreased. The increase in hypolimnetic inorganic Hg (IHg = total Hg - MeHg), which reached a peak of 40 pM (8.0 ng.L-1), was slower, possibly because mobilized IHg was methylated. In the lower lake, hypolimnetic MeHg and IHg increased less dramatically during summer stratification, reaching only 5 and 24 pM (1.0 and 4.8 ng.L-1), respectively. There was no detectable concomitant decrease in sediment MeHg. In both lakes, MeHg appeared to increase simultaneously with total Fe and Mn in the hypolimnion, as did IHg in the lower lake. Our observations suggest that the presence of hydrous ferric and manganese oxides decreased the mobility of Hg in both lakes but increased MeHg production in the upper lake.																			0706-652X					MAR	2001	58	3					506	517		10.1139/cjfas-58-3-506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-3-506													WOS:000167371400007
J	Yamamoto, Y; Nakahara, H				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Nakahara, Hiroyuki			Seasonal variations in the diel vertical distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton in a shallow pond	PHYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The seasonal succession of phytoplankton diversity, and the variations in the diel vertical distribution of phyto- and zooplankton were investigated in a small shallow pond (1.7 m water depth) in 2003. It was inferred that the water tended to stratify weakly in the daytime from February to June. In February and April, the green alga Golenkinia radiata Chodat dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. The cell density of G. radiata greatly decreased in April, when rotifers increased near the bottom. The vertical mixing was attenuated in June, large populations of the euglenoids (Lepocinclis salina Fritsch, Phacus acuminatus Stokes, Trachelomonas hispida (Perty) Stein et Deflandre) developed, and the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae var. klebahnii Elenk. appeared at low density. Euglenoids and A. flos-aquae were mostly distributed in the bottom layer. In late September, when the water was mixed throughout the day, euglenoids and A. flos-aquae were distributed evenly throughout the water column. The zooplankton (cyclopoid copepods and rotifers) densities in September were the lowest throughout the year. The vertical mixing increased in November, and the phytoplankton community was composed of A. flos-aquae, P. acuminatus, T. hispida and the green alga Ankistrodesmus falcatus (Corda) Ralfs. In November, at the final stage of water bloom of A. flos-aquae, its population density decreased with depth. The two euglenoids exhibited similar cell distributions at 0.8 m and 1.6 m during 1-3 November. A. falcatus was distributed evenly throughout the water column; however, when the vertical mixing lessened, the cells at the surface started to sink. Copepod nauplii and rotifers appeared at high densities in November. Seasonal variation in the phytoplankton community structure in the pond seemed to be related to the vertical mixing of the water. In addition, zooplankton, especially rotifers, might play an important role in initiating a spring clear-water phase and in the bloom collapse of A. flos-aquae.																			1322-0829	1440-1835				DEC	2006	54	4					280	293		10.1111/j.1440-1835.2006.00435.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1835.2006.00435.x													WOS:000242866100004

The neonatal mortality rate from malformations was inversely related to the socioeconomic status of the father, but rates were higher for all occupational groups (except one) in the areas of high radioactivity. Extensive interviews were used to eliminate bias from medical radiation, infectious disease during pregnancy, and other etiological factors. In areas of "probable" radioactive materials the malformation rate was highest (16.9) in those communities deriving their water supply from wells and springs, and lowest (12.4) where lakes and rivers were the sources of supply. This is contrasted with 12.9 and 11.9, respectively, for the 2 types of sources in "unlikely" radioactive areas. The general range is from 0.0 to 1.7 x 10 g of radium per ml in public water supplies, with one major exception in which the water contained 29.0 x 10-16 g/ml.																									1959	49	4					497	513		10.2105/AJPH.49.4.497	http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.49.4.497								13649999					WOS:A1959CAX0700009
J	Oetelaar, GA; Beaudoin, AB				Oetelaar, Gerald Anthony; Beaudoin, Alwynne B.			Evidence of cultural responses to the impact of the Mazama ash fall from deeply stratified archaeological sites in southern Alberta, Canada	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In a series of papers, we adopted a regional perspective to explore the short and long-term impacts of the Mount Mazama eruption on the plant and animal communities of the northwestern Plains and later developed a model to explain human responses to this natural disaster. The model assumed the convergence of natural disasters which forced the local bison hunters to abandon the impacted zone and to seek refuge among their distant relatives living beyond the eastern limits of their homeland. Together, the refugees and their hosts intensified their subsistence strategies and adapted or developed new methods of food preparation to accommodate the increased pressure on the local resource base. Throughout their stay, the groups continued to monitor the rebirth of their traditional homeland and eventually returned to the places occupied by their ancestors. Upon their return, the groups continued to hunt bison but adapted the stone boiling technology to produce bone grease and pemmican. This nutritious, storable and transportable food source alleviated the concerns about long-term shortages and became an important product in the regional exchange networks. The primary objective of this paper is to test this model using sedimentary, pedological and archaeological data recovered from two deeply stratified sites with evidence of human occupations before and after the eruption of Mount Mazama.

B.; Van der Velde, Gerard; Wijnhoven, Sander			Diversity, occurrence and feeding traits of caddisfly larvae as indicators for ecological integrity of river-floodplain habitats along a connectivity gradient	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In order to assess ecological values of Lower Rhine and Meuse floodplain habitats we studied the spatial and seasonal variation in diversity, species assemblages and feeding traits of caddisfly larvae in water bodies over the lateral connectivity gradient: eupotamon: main and secondary channels: parapotamon: channels connected permanently with the main channel only at their downstream ends; plesiopotamon: disconnected channels close to the main channel; paleopotamon: abandoned meanders at a greater distance from the main channel. Spatial variety was studied by analyzing the summer species composition in 70 Lower Rhine and Meuse water bodies which were categorized in connectivity habitats, whereas seasonal variety was studied in Lower Rhine water bodies along a connectivity gradient by monthly sampling over a whole year. Physico-chemical data and environmental parameters were recorded for each water body during sampling. Diversity and species assemblages of caddisfly larvae varied in relation to connectivity, macrophyte diversity and abundance and stream velocity. A comparison with historical records and species lists from less disturbed rivers showed that diversity in the main channel was very low. Caddisfly larvae species assemblages varied over the connectivity gradient. Lotic habitats (eupotamon) were separated from the lentic ones, and the well vegetated paleopotamon from the sparsely vegetated parapotamon and pleisopotamon habitats, indicating the overall importance of vegetation and current velocity for the species assemblages. Hydropsychidae have been found in the eupotamon exclusively, whereas Limnephilidae, Hydroptilidae and Polycentropodidae have been found predominantly in the paleopotamon water bodies. Leptoceridae were found in all floodplain water body categories. A similar pattern of distribution of families along the lateral connectivity gradient was found in more natural rivers. Caddisfly larvae species feeding traits showed a clear differentiation over the lateral connectivity gradient with filter-feeders and scrapers most important in the eupotamon and parapotamon, and shredders, piercers and predators most dominant in the paleopotamon habitats, indicating the importance of nutritional resources in relation to hydrological connectivity for the structure and functioning of caddisfly larvae species assemblages. The analysis of the species feeding traits allows generalizations towards the entire aquatic community and general prognoses for other floodplain ecosystems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Specziár, A				Specziár, A			First year ontogenetic diet patterns in two coexisting Sander species, S. lucioperca and S. volgensis in Lake Balaton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												First year ontogenetic diet patterns and size-dependent diet partitioning of two coexisting piscivorous percids, pikeperch and Volga pikeperch were analysed in Lake Balaton. Diet patterns of the two pikeperches followed a common trend, catching larger preys at larger sizes, but in details they were different. Until 20-30 mm size age-0 pikeperch fed on planktonic rnicrocrustaceans and were found only in the pelagic zone. After this size, from the end of May, a part of the stock shifted habitat and moved to the littoral zone to feed on Limnomysis benedeni. Majority of the stock stayed in the pelagic zone and shifted to Leptodora kindtii. In the pelagic group early piscivory, mainly cannibalism, occurred only sporadically. However, the few individuals that reached 100 mm size during the first year were typically piscivorous. Volga pikeperch stayed in the pelagic zone during the first year and shifted from planktonic microcrustaceans to benthic macroinvertebrates. General patterns of the first year diet ontogeny were similar in the different areas of Lake Balaton in both pikeperches with only some differences in the secondary food resources, especially in the share of chironomids. Chironomids were eaten at highest ratio by the two fish species in the Keszthely basin in accordance with their abundance pattern. Maximum prey sizes increased significantly with predator size in both pikeperch and Volga pikeperch. However, pikeperch ate much larger prey than did Volga pikeperch at the same size although they have a similar mouth gape to length ratio. These two, closely related pikeperches, although occur in the same habitat and have similar patterns of diet ontogeny, effectively partition food resources in Lake Balaton during the first growing season, except in the very beginning of their ontogeny at L = 5-10 mm size. It appears that age-0 Volga pikeperch is not a significant competitor for the economically highly rated pikeperch in Lake Balaton. Oil the other hand, it is age-0 pikeperch that might affect Volga pikeperch during its early ontogeny, in the planktivorous stage.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													0018-8158					OCT 15	2005	549						115	130		10.1007/s10750-005-5766-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-5766-x													WOS:000232921100010
J	Sakata, M; Marumoto, K				Sakata, M; Marumoto, K			Dry deposition fluxes and deposition velocities of trace metals in the Tokyo metropolitan area measured with a water surface sampler	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dry deposition fluxes and deposition velocities (=deposition flux/atmospheric concentration) for trace metals including Hg, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn in the Tokyo metropolitan area were measured using an improved water surface sampler. Mercury is deposited on the water surface in both gaseous (reactive gaseous mercury, RGM) and particulate (particulate mercury, Hg(p)) forms. The results based on 1 yr observations found that dry deposition plays a significant if not dominant role in trace metal deposition in this urban area, contributing fluxes ranging from 0.46 (Cd) to 3.0 (Zn) times those of concurrent wet deposition fluxes. The deposition velocities were found to be dependent on the deposition of coarse particles larger than approximately 5 mum in diameter on the basis of model calculations. Our analysis suggests that the 84.13% diameter is a more appropriate index for each deposited metal than the 50% diameter in the assumed undersize log-normal distribution, because larger particles are responsible for the flux. The deposition velocities for trace metals other than mercury increased exponentially with an increase in their 84.13% diameters. Using this regression equation, the deposition velocities for Hg(p) were estimated from its 84.13% diameter. The deposition fluxes for Hg(p) calculated from the estimated velocities tended to be close to the mercury fluxes measured with the water surface sampler during the study periods except during summer.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 1	2004	38	7					2190	2197		10.1021/es030467k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es030467k								15112824					WOS:000220577800049

This commences c. 6000 cal yr BP in a freshwater environment with swamp forest composed mainly of Laurelia, Leptospermum, Ascarina, and Cyathea spp. Dodonaea and Cyperaceae grew on margins of this forest. Forest on the hills surrounding the wetland comprised mainly Metrosideros, with emergent Dacrydium and Libocedrus. Ascarina, Rhopalostylis, and Cyathea dealbata type were a significant part of the understorey of the hillside forest. Around the time of deposition of the 5550 cal yr BP Whakatane tephra, a freshwater lake developed at the site. Extensive Cyperaceae swamp developed on the fringes of the lake. Shortly after c. 2900 cal yr BP, Dacrycarpus briefly invaded swamp forest, possibly as a result of storm disturbance, and the site made the final transition to swamp. Myrsine and then Hebe shrubs invaded fringes of the swamp as the water table fell, possibly as a result of a change to drier conditions in the Late Holocene. Polynesian deforestation, as indicated by the presence of abundant charcoal and Pteridium spores, is recorded in this core as occurring shortly after deposition of the c. 600 cal yr BP Kaharoa tephra.

They are prone to regular flooding, which occurs after abundant rainfall or snowmelt events. The floods can form several meters deep intermittent lakes that can persist for months. Human settlements around poljes have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods. However, many neighbouring villages expanded during the last decades to areas that might be endangered by large flood events. In addition, a recent study has shown that several poljes encountered floods of more severe amplitude in mid-Holocene due to a prevailing humid climate. As current knowledge of polje's hydrology appears to be still insufficient, further research is needed. This work aims to identify the factors controlling polje flooding and evaluates their impact on the flood amplitude and duration. To do so, a list of parameters potentially controlling flooding is established. The relevance of each parameter is tested by using two idealized numerical models. The first one considers exclusively the polje from the springs to the ponors, whereas the second integrates the aquifer adjacent to the polje outflow side. First results show the usefulness of simple numerical models to identify the effect of each parameter on the flood amplitude and duration. The findings are combined to simulate a flood of medium intensity and long duration that occurred on a typical polje. A comparison of the results with real data demonstrates that the aquifer draining the polje needs to be considered to understand properly the flooding dynamics. The approach presented within this work has the potential to be used in other poljes encountering similar hydrological situations, but also lays foundation for flooding modelling in other karst areas.

J	EarnestKoons, K; Wooster, GA; Bowser, PR				EarnestKoons, K; Wooster, GA; Bowser, PR			Invasive walleye dermal sarcoma in laboratory-maintained walleyes Stizostedion vitreum	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Walleye dermal sarcoma (WDS) was first described as a multifocal cutaneous neoplasm of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum in Oneida Lake, New York, USA. The neoplasm was subsequently shown to be caused by a type C retrovirus. We have successfully transmitted the neoplasm in laboratory-maintained young-of-the-year (YOY) walleyes in a number of pathogenesis studies over the past 6 yr. Neoplasms in these laboratory trials were typical of those superficial neoplasms observed in adult feral walleyes. A transmission study was begun summer 1994 using 9 wk old walleyes. Starting at 56 d and continuing throughout the experiment, injected fish developed grossly visible, multiple small white skin masses that varied from 0.5 to 10 mm in diameter. These masses appeared on the skin of the head, back, flank, fins and lips. Histopathological examination revealed that some of these neoplasms, especially those collected at 84 d and beyond, did not remain cutaneous, but were locally invasive and replaced normal tissue, primarily muscle. One neoplasm on the head of a young walleye had deformed the brain and had invaded the skull. Due to the unusual invasive nature of the microscopic lesions of the neoplasm, these findings are reported.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				MAR 7	1996	24	3					227	232		10.3354/dao024227	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao024227													WOS:A1996UG30400010

Despite this, only a limited number of well-dated near shore marine and lake sediment based palaeoenvironmental records exist from this region: so our understanding of the longer-term context of this rapid climate change is limited. Here we provide new well-dated constraints on the deglaciation history, and changes in sea ice and climate based on analyses of sedimentological proxies, diatoms and fossil pigments in a sediment core collected from an isolation basin on Beak Island in Prince Gustav Channel, NE Antarctic Peninsula (63 degrees 36'S, 57 degrees 20'W). Twenty two radiocarbon dates provided a chronology for the core including a minimum modelled age for deglaciation of 10,602 cal yr BP, following the onset of marine sedimentation. Conditions remained cold and perennial sea ice persisted in this part of Prince Gustav Channel until c. 9372 cal yr BR This was followed by a seasonally open marine environment until at least 6988 cal yr BP, corresponding with the early retreat and disintegration of the ice shelf in southern Prince Gustav Channel. Following isolation of the basin from 6988 cal yr BP a relatively cold climate persisted until 3169 cal yr BR A Mid-late Holocene climate optimum occurred between 3169 and 2120 cal yr BP, inferred from multiple indicators of increased biological production. This postdates the onset of the Mid-late Holocene climate optimum in the South Shetland Islands (4380 cal yr BP) and the South Orkney Islands (3800 cal yr BP) suggesting that cooler climate systems of the Weddell Sea Gyre to the east of the Peninsula may have buffered the onset of warming. Climate deterioration is inferred from c. 2120 cal yr BP until 543 cal yr BR This was followed by warming. Superimposed on this warming trend, the instrumental record of recent warming at nearby Hope Bay is mirrored by a recent increase in the lake's primary production and a shift in the diatom communities in the uppermost 3 cm of sediments, suggesting that this is amongst the first records to show an ecological response to recent rapid temperature increase. These new constraints on glaciological and climate events in Prince Gustav Channel are reviewed in the context of wider changes in the Antarctic region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Weber, MM; Cibulka, D				Weber, Megan M.; Cibulka, Daniel			Overwinter survival of Corbicula fluminea in a central Minnesota lake	PLOS ONE												Although Corbicula fluminea has been one of the more prolific freshwater invasive species in the world, previous studies have suggested a low probability for overwinter survival in northern latitudes without an artificially created thermal refuge. The discovery of live C. fluminea in a central Minnesota lake absent any known thermal refuge in 2020 presented an opportunity to further evaluate the overwinter survival and population structure of C. fluminea at the presumed edge of their potential range. The population was monitored from December 2020 through September 2021 alongside water temperature to better understand at which temperatures C. fluminea survived and if the population structure suggested reproduction occurring in the lake. We documented live C. fluminea in temperatures as low as 0.3 degrees C. Shell size of recovered individuals suggested multiple cohorts, and the appearance of a new cohort at the end of the study, indicating active reproduction in the lake and suggesting the population had likely been present in the lake for at least two winters by the conclusion of the study period. Our findings provide evidence of the survival below historically documented lower lethal temperature limits and suggests adaptations to modeling predicting suitable habitat, both present and in a changing climate, are necessary to better assess risk of invasion by this species.

However, the coupled physical and biogeochemical dynamics of these systems have received little attention compared with larger and deeper systems. Here, we examine the coupling between physical dynamics, sediment dynamics and oxygen-carbon dynamics in Mirror Lake, a small shallow pond in Storrs, CT, USA, using high frequency monitoring data and a simple coupled physical-biogeochemical model. The physical dynamics are characterised by a diurnal pattern of daytime thermal stratification and nighttime mixing. Observations show that the distribution of oxygen is tightly coupled with both the diurnal physical dynamics and photosynthesis-respiration reactions. Two 24-h periods in the summer of 2003 with similar meteorological conditions but distinctly different oxygen dynamics were simulated with a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. The model results suggest that the dynamics of sediment resuspension during nighttime convective overturn and subsequent settling during daytime stratification are critical in explaining the observed oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon distributions. The diurnal dynamics provide a biogeochemical hot spot and hot moment by coupling meterologic forcing, resuspension of sediments, physical mixing and biological activity to hypoxia and anoxia in Mirror Lake.

The artificial hydraulic irrigation engineering took the place of the natural river system, the reservoirs took the place of natural lakes, which in turn enhanced the space-time redistribution of surface water based on the natural evolution, and so did groundwater. The groundwater recharge reduced 26.2% in 46 years from 1950 to 1995 in the southern piedmont flood plain of Tarim Basin due to mean yearly population increase rate of 27.7% e and associated with the water use rate increasing from 24.6% to 58.4%. At the same time the artificial water system seepage give primary play to groundwater recharge, which is up to 57.6% whilst that of the natural system reduce to 33.7%. As a result, groundwater level drop 3 - 5m widespread except some irrigation area and surroundings of plain reservoir. Spring water discharge also reduce about 37.6% and discharge zone continuously move away to the north with the value of 0.5 - 1.2km in the past 40 years.																			1002-0063					MAR	2002	12	1					50	54		10.1007/s11769-002-0070-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-002-0070-4													WOS:000206553000008

Estimates of Abundance and Extreme Catch-and-Release Exploitation in a Southern Riverine Muskellunge Fishery	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fisheries have increased in abundance and popularity in numerous southern and mid-Atlantic rivers. However, the paucity of information for these fisheries has limited biologists' ability to effectively manage these resources. We utilized data from simultaneously conducted fishery-dependent tag return and fishery-independent capture-recapture studies to estimate catch-and-release exploitation and abundance of Muskellunge in the James River, Virginia. During winter electrofishing surveys in 2016-2019, we tagged 747 individual Muskellunge with dart tags and PIT tags. Thirty-seven percent of tags were returned by anglers, and 33% of tagged Muskellunge were recaptured at least once during subsequent electrofishing surveys. Eighty-eight percent of angled fish were caught by individuals targeting Muskellunge, and only 1.1% of returned tags were from fish that were harvested. Catch-and-release exploitation (u) estimates obtained using a Brownie dead recovery model differed between the upriver (mean u +/- SE = 0.57 +/- 0.09) and downriver (1.00 +/- 0.10) reaches of our study area. Similarly, densities of adult (>= 762-mm) Muskellunge differed between the two areas (upriver: 0.80 fish/ha; downriver: 0.50 fish/ha) but were comparable to densities observed in lakes and at least one other river. The greatest site-specific density (4.69 fish/ha) was observed at a 1.6-km reach below the lowest dam, which concentrated fish and restricted upstream movement. Given the high values of u in the James River and the growing popularity of Muskellunge angling in southern waters, investigations into the effects of this level of angling on Muskellunge populations (e.g., trophy potential, abundance) will provide managers with the information needed to develop comprehensive Muskellunge management strategies.

Representatives of each physiological group were recovered at an incubation temperature of 2.degree. C and for all the physiological groups the 2.degree. C counts were usually higher than the 37.degree. C counts, although sulfate-reducing bacteria were not recoverable at an incubation temperature of 37.degree. C. The numbers of each physiological type were generally higher in the sediments than in the water column, except in the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria for which the counts were low and often below the detection limit. Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria usually outnumbered the other physiological groups surveyed, and winter minima were characteristic of some of the physiological groups. A relatively stable density of anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, as a function of sediment depth, was observed when the incubation temperature was 2.degree. C. At 37.degree. C, these anaerobes were not detected; this was true for sulfate-reducing bacteria at both temperatures. Heterotrophic bacterial isolates from the permanently cold sediments were examined with regard to gram reaction, the obligate or facultative nature of anaerobes, ability to use ecologically important substrates, psychrophilic type and temperature range for growth, growth. Isolates recovered at 2.degree. C were predominantly gram-negative bacilli, whereas isolates recovered at 37.degree. C were predominantly gram-positive bacilli. The anaerobic isolates were mainly gram-positive bacilli regardless of the isolation temperature and most of those examined were obligately anaerobic.

J	Grochowska, J				Grochowska, Jolanta			Proposal for Water Quality Improvement by Using an Innovative and Comprehensive Restoration Method	WATER												This study was conducted on Milkowskie Lake (23.7 ha; 15.0 m) in the context of implementing new restoration methods for improving the water quality. The study found that the nutrient loads introduced into the lake from catchment are higher than the critical concentrations for the ecosystem. This indicates the need to cut off or at least reduce the main sources of pollution. The primary production in the lake is extremely large: oxygen saturation of the surface water above 200%, pH value of 9.44, chlorophyll a content of 70.98 mg m(-3), and a low visibility of 0.5 m. The most important step in maintaining good lake quality will be to redirect waters of the main inflows SI-1 and SI-2 to the hypolimnion zone by pipelines. A complementary method for discharging the polluted water to the hypolimnion zone will be the phosphorus inactivation method by using iron and aluminum coagulants. After the application of spring doses of coagulants, an anti-cyanobacterial preparation will be introduced into the water in the "active bottom" zone, and then bioremediation by a microbiological probiotic preparation will be applied to the sediment in the same zone. A new complex protection and restoration method should be supported in the form of biomanipulation.

The non-hydrostatic 3D hydrodynamic model featuring Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES) has been verified and compared with field observations in 2002 (the present-day year, PDY). A significant temperature increase in surface water, recording more than 34 degrees in the East Coast of the North Basin of the Lake Biwa, has been projected for the simulation for the very hot year (VHY), determined from comparison with MRI-GCM output for the year 2099, which may induce a catastrophic impact on lake water quality during the period. Weak stratification is predicted to start from March in VHY, compared with observations of stratification that doesn't commence until after April in PDY. The thickness of the epilimnion which is around 15-20 m in PDY increases to 25-30 m in August in VHY due to a much higher atmospheric temperature. According to the model outputs, the vertical mixing may not always decrease due to the accumulated heat in the hypolimnion which has a higher temperature than the temperature during the winter. Accumulated heat in the hypolimnion may induce catastrophic degradation in the lake ecosystem.

Lake Erie's watershed is mostly agricultural, and fertilizers, manure, and drainage practices contribute to high nutrient loads. This study aimed to clarify the role of western Lake Erie sediments in either exacerbating or mitigating conditions that fuel HABs via recycling and/or removal, respectively, of excess N and reactive P. Sediment-water interface N and orthophosphate (ortho-P) dynamics and functional gene analyses of key N transformations were evaluated during a dry, low HAB year (2016) and a wet, high HAB year (2017). On average, western basin sediments were a net N sink and thus perform a valuable ecosystem service via N removal. However, sediments were a source of ortho-P and chemically reduced N. Western basin sediments can theoretically remove 29% of average annual watershed total N loading. Denitrification rates were lower during the high (2017) versus low bloom year (2016), suggesting that high external N loading and large HABs inhibit the capacity of sediments to perform that ecosystem service. Despite being a net N sink on average, western basin sediments released ammonium and urea, chemically reduced N forms that are energetically conducive to non-N-fixing, toxin-producing cyanobacterial HABs, especially during the critical period of low external loading and high biomass. These results support other recent work highlighting the urgent need to include N cycling and internal load dynamics in ecosystem models and mitigation efforts for eutrophic systems.

J	Flies, CB; Peplies, J; Schüler, D				Flies, CB; Peplies, J; Schüler, D			Combined approach for characterization of uncultivated magnetotactic bacteria from various aquatic environments	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Both magnetic collection and "race track" purification techniques were highly effective for selective enrichment of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) from complex communities, as suggested by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Using these purification methods, the occurrence and diversity of MTB in microcosms from various marine and freshwater environments were assayed by using a combined microscopic, molecular, and cultivation approach. Most microcosms were dominated by magnetotactic cocci. Consistently, the majority of retrieved 16S RNA sequences were affiliated with a distinct cluster in the Alphaproteobacteria. Within this lineage the levels of sequence divergence were < 1 to 11%, indicating genus-level diversity between magnetotactic cocci from various microcosms, as well as between MTB from different stages of succession of the same microcosms. The community composition in microscosms underwent drastic succession during incubation, and significant heterogeneities were observed between microcosms from the same environmental sources. A novel magnetotactic rod (MHB-1) was detected in a sediment sample from a lake in northern Germany by fluorescence in situ hybridization. MHB-1 falls into the Nitrospira phylum, displaying 91% 16S rRNA sequence similarity to "Magnetobacterium bavaricum." In extensive cultivation attempts, we failed to isolate MHB-1, as well as most other MTB present in our samples. However, although magnetotactic spirilla were not frequently observed in the enrichments, 10 novel isolates of the genus Magnetospirillum which had not routinely been isolated in pure culture before were obtained.

We aimed to answer three questions: (1) whether the abundance of non-native species differed among lakes and rivers; (2) whether the probability of occurrence of non-native species differed among lakes and rivers over time, and (3) whether the probabilities of occurrence of non-native species are explained by their functional traits, phylogenetic relationships, or the area of native range. An analysis of covariance was performed to determine the differences in species abundance between habitats. The probability of occurrence for each non-native species was determined through logistic regression. To identify the factors that explain the probability of occurrence, the probability of occurrence at the first and last year of the sampled period was modelled as a function of the native range of the species and the axes from the ordinations of functional traits and phylogenetic relationships. Species abundance was highest in lakes, while the probability of occurrence of species was highest in rivers. Range size, functional traits of life history, and habitat use dimensions, positively affected the probability of occurrence of non-native species. The most important functional traits were offspring investment, egg size and fertilization type, defense, and shape factor.					; Agostinho, Angelo/S-1538-2019; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Angulo, Mirtha/AAF-1758-2021; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/D-5888-2013; Corrêa Alves, Diego/OGR-2483-2025	Angulo Valencia, Mirtha Amanda/0000-0003-2195-7250; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; Correa Alves, Diego/0000-0002-2109-9738													1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2023	25	4					1197	1210		10.1007/s10530-022-02974-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-022-02974-5		DEC 2022											WOS:000901721600003

Sampling was conducted before, during, and after a daily generation cycle with measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, iron, manganese, and turbidity. Temperatures were near 25 degrees C during generation, fluctuated 3-4 degrees C during nongeneration, and increased in a downstream direction to near 28 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were between 4 and 6 mg L-1 during generation and increased in a downstream direction. During nongeneration, concentrations in the upstream region of the tailwater were near 2 mg L-1 but were between 4 and 10 mg L-1 in the rest of the study area. Maximum concentrations, 6 to 10 mg L-1, were observed prior to the hydrograph peak at each station, suggesting leading edge effects of increased flow and aeration as substrate was covered during river stage increases. Concentrations of metals increased in a downstream direction coincident with turbidity increases from near 3 to 25 NTUs, suggesting resuspension and possibly flocculation. Dissimilar patterns were observed for nongeneration when concentrations decreased in a downstream direction while turbidity was relatively constant and lower than generation values, suggesting settling with decreased flow.																			0270-5060					MAR	1999	14	1					103	112		10.1080/02705060.1999.9663659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1999.9663659													WOS:000079013100010

Observational data from 15 locations, wind profiler radar, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to evaluate the WRF nested-LES performance in simulating lake breezes. Results indicate that the simulated temporal and spatial variations of the lake breeze by WRF nested LES are consistent with observations. The simulations with high-resolution grid spacing and the LES scheme have a high correlation coefficient and low mean bias when evaluated against 2-m temperature, 10-m wind, and horizontal and vertical lake-breeze circulations. The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) remains stable over the lake throughout the lake-breeze event, and the stability becomes even stronger as the lake breeze reaches its mature stage. The improved ABL simulation with LES at a grid spacing of 150 m indicates that the non-LES planetary boundary layer parameterization scheme does not adequately represent subgrid-scale turbulent motions. Running WRF fully coupled to a lake model improves lake-surface temperature and consequently the lake-breeze simulations. Allowing for additional model spinup results in a positive impact on lake-surface temperature prediction but is a heavy computational burden. Refinement of a water-property parameter used in the Community Land Model, version 4.5, within WRF and constraining the lake-surface temperature with observational data would further improve lake-breeze representation.

J	Pithart, D				Pithart, D			Diurnal vertical migration study during a winter bloom of cryptophyceae in a floodplain pool	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The diurnal vertical migration (DVM) of the phytoplankton community was studied in a small (270 m(2)), shallow (1.8 m), and frozen floodplain pool. Steep vertical gradients were detected in O-2, NH4+-N NO3--N and PO43--P profiles. The phytoplankton of the pool is characterized by year round dominance of Cryptophyceae: Cryptomonas curvata and Cryptomonas marssonii created more than 90% of total phytoplankton biomass during the time of study. DVM was studied by analysing vertical profiles six times during a 24 hour cycle; samples were taken at 20 cm intervals along the profiles. Koliella planktonica, the only non-motile alga, showed a stable uniform distribution. Dinobryon divergens and Chrysococcus rufescens created a stable distinct concentration maximum at 40 cm. Unlike these three species, both Cryptomonas spp. actively changed their position during the 24 hour cycle with distinctive evening downward and morning upward migration. The absence of filtering zooplankton excluded its influence on the patterns of phytoplankton DVM. The results showed the key role of PhAR (Photosynthetic active irradiance) in day - positioning of Cryptomonas. Night-time uptake of phosphate and/or ammonium at the bottom is probable, although direct evidence is lacking.																			0020-9309						1997	82	1					33	46		10.1002/iroh.19970820106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19970820106													WOS:A1997WY76500003

Two sites were studied off Hamlin Beach State Park, one station at 35 m and the other at 100 m. At the 35-m station, total abundance ranged from near zero in late September to 207 m-2 in mid-August, with a mean abundance of 48 organisms m-2 for the study period. Average biomass and porduction values at the 35-m station were 0.80 g dry weight m-2 and 0.13 g dry weight m-2 per 7 months, respectively. At the 100-m station, total abundance ranged from 110 m-2 in late September to 860 m-2 in mid-July, with a mean abundance of 378 m-2 for the study period. Average biomass and total production at the 100-m station was 0.68 g dry weight m-2 and 1.23 g dry weight m-2 per 7 months, respectively. Mysis relicta abundance increased from 1971 to 1984 in the offshore and nearshore of Lake Ontario. This increase in abundance may be related to the stocking of salmonines in Lake Ontario and/or to the significant die-off of adult alewives in the winter of 1983-1984.																			0380-1330						1989	15	2					223	232		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71478-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71478-7													WOS:A1989AL80300006

Viscosity structure of the crust and upper mantle in western Nevada from isostatic rebound patterns of the late Pleistocene Lake Lahontan high shoreline	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												[1] Large lakes can both produce and record significant crustal deformation. We present an analysis of the isostatic rebound pattern recorded in the shorelines of paleolake Lahontan, in western Nevada, using a layered Maxwell viscoelastic model. The inferred viscosity structure depends on loading history. We use three variants of a well-documented lake surface elevation model as input and recover corresponding estimates of viscosity and density structure. A simple two-layer model, with an elastic plate over an inviscid half-space, fits the observed elevation pattern quite well, with a residual variance of 32% of the data variance. Using multilayered, finite viscosity models, the residual variance is reduced to 20% of the data variance, which is very near to the noise level. In the higher-resolution models, the viscosity is below 10(18) Pa s over the depth range from 80 to 160 km. The minimum viscosity is very similar to the value that has been seen in the eastern Great Basin, from similar analyses of Lake Bonneville shorelines, but the low-viscosity zone is thinner beneath Bonneville. Making small adjustments to a seismically derived density structure allows an improved fit to the shoreline observations. Additionally, we find that small variations in proposed loading models can result in presumably spurious density inversions, and suggest that this modeling approach provides a test for loading histories.

However, a significant disparity in both B concentrations and isotope values between these two lakes has emerged, showcasing distinct evolutionary trends in their B isotopes over the past three decades. The underlying mechanisms and evolutionary processes driving these variations remain ambiguous. This study elucidates the hydrochemical characteristics and delta 11B values for brines, geothermal springs, and river waters around the DQL-XQL, concurrently monitoring hydrogeochemical parameters in XQL and Tataleng River at a monthly temporal scale. Our findings corroborate that: (1) The delta 11B values of XQL waters have markedly increased from 0.52%o to 2.81%o, while those of DQL waters have decreased from 6.17%o to 4.16%o, exhibiting diametrically opposed isotopic trends in the face of warming-wetting climate change on the QTP. (2) Spatially, B concentration and delta 11B values in the low salinity region of DQL are predominantly influenced by the redissolution of B-rich sediments, witnessing inconspicuous changes in the high salinity region. Temporally, the delta 11B values of DQL waters experienced considerable fluctuations, ranging from 2.52%o to 10.81%o in the early 1990s, attributed to isotopic fractionation (solid-liquid separation) resulting from borate mining activities. After more than 30 years of recovery, its B isotope values have stabilized in recent years. (3) On a monthly time scale, delta 11B values of XQL and Tataleng River waters exhibited pronounced seasonal variations regulated by water residence time and the formation of secondary minerals, manifesting as high values in the dry season and low values in the wet season. Rainy or humid climatic conditions encourage an increase in weathering flux in B-rich areas, leading to a higher transport of resources into the terminal salt lake. Over a multi-decadal time scale, alterations in the hydrological budget and mean weathering flux induced by a warming-wetting climate may modify the proportion of contributions from various sources, thereby regulating the delta 11B values of XQL and Laguo Co. (4) When employing B isotopes to investigate the salt lakes evolution and paleo-environmental changes, it is imperative to consider the influence of alterations in water chemistry and isotope driven by changes in source-sink processes resulting from climate changes or tectonic movements.

Inversion statistics for six upper-air stations in the American Southwest are derived for the period 1994-2008 from radiosonde data reported by the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which use different significant level standards. GTS data indicate that low-level elevated inversions have increased in frequency at four of six sites, consistent with enhanced regional stagnation projected by models. NCDC data, in contrast, show remarkable declines in weak, near-surface inversions through 2001, indicating local surface conditions may counteract atmospheric dynamics in regulating inversion activity and air quality. To further test the sensitivity of inversion activity to climate, associations between wintertime inversion frequency and large-scale circulation are quantified using the self-organizing map technique. Twenty-four representative circulation patterns are derived from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) 500-hPa geopotential height fields, and these patterns are correlated with inversion frequency at each site. Inversion activity in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Albuquerque and Santa Teresa, New Mexico, is found to correspond well with large-scale anticyclonic ridging; however, sensitivities to large-scale circulation in Denver, Colorado, and Flagstaff and Tucson, Arizona, are weak. Denver stands out in exhibiting a higher percentage of near-surface inversions in winter than the other southwestern sites. These findings indicate that dynamical changes with climate will not uniformly influence inversions and hence urban air quality conditions in the American Southwest.

J	Nienhuis, PH; Bakker, JP; Grootjans, AP; Gulati, RD; de Jonge, VN				Nienhuis, PH; Bakker, JP; Grootjans, AP; Gulati, RD; de Jonge, VN			The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Netherlands are a small, low-lying delta in W. Europe (42 000 km 2;50degrees-54degrees N; 3degrees-8degrees E), mainly consisting of alluvial deposits from the North Sea and from the large rivers Rhine and Meuse. The country was 'created by man'. The conversion of natural aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems into drained agricultural land was a major cultural operation over the past 1000 years. Roughly 55% of the country's surface area is still agricultural land. Some decades ago, The Netherlands' landscape was characterised by an armoured coastline and bridled estuaries, a drastically reduced area of saline and freshwater marshes, fully regulated rivers and streams, and numerous artificial lakes. The aquatic ecosystems beyond the influence of the large rivers, the Pleistocene raised bogs and moor lands, have almost been completely annihilated in the past. Acidification and eutrophication led to the deterioration of the remaining softwater lake vegetation. Last but not least, an artificial drainage system was constructed, leading to an unnatural water table all over the country, high in summer, low in winter. Only very recently, some 25 years ago, the tide has been turned and ecological rehabilitation and restoration of disturbed ecosystems are in full swing now, enhanced by the European Union policy to set aside agricultural land in the Netherlands in favour of the development of 'nature'. The state of the art of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecological restoration projects in the Netherlands is given. Starting from the conceptual basis of restoration ecology, the successes and failures of hundreds of restoration projects are given. Numerous successful projects are mentioned. In general, ecological restoration endeavours are greatly benefiting from progressive experience in the course of the years. Failures mainly occur by insufficient application of physical, chemical or ecological principles. The spontaneous colonisation by plants and animals, following habitat reconstruction, is preferred. But sometimes the re-introduction of keystone species (e.g. eelgrass; salmon; beaver) is necessary in case the potential habitats are isolated or fragmented, or when a seed bank is lacking, thus not allowing viable populations to develop. Re-introduction of traditional management techniques (e. g. mowing without fertilisation; low intensity grazing) is important to rehabilitate the semi-natural and cultural landscapes, so characteristic for the Netherlands. For aquatic ecosystems proper (estuaries, rivers, streams, larger lakes) the rule of thumb is that re-establishment of the abiotic habitat conditions is a pre-requisite for the return of the target species. This implies rehabilitation of former hydrological end geomorphological conditions, and an increase in spatial heterogeneity. The 'bottom-up' technique of lake restoration, viz. reduction in nutrient loadings, and removal of nutrient-rich organic sediment, is the preferred strategy. The 'top-down' approach of curing eutrophicated ecosystems, that is drastic reduction of fish stock, mainly bream, and introduction of carnivorous fish, may be considered as complementary. For semi-aquatic ecosystems (river-fed and rain-fed peat moors, brook valleys, coastal dune slacks) it also counts that the abiotic constraints should be lifted, but here the species-oriented conservation strategy, the enhancement of the recovery of characteristic plant and animal species is mainly followed. An important pre-requisite for the rehabilitation of the original natural or semi-natural vegetation is the presence of viable seed bank. Restoration of salt-marsh vegetation has to deal with a short-lived persistent seed bank, which means that transport of seeds by water currents is important. Isolated softwater ecosystems may rely on the long-lived seeds of the aquatic macrophytes. The paper ends with some notes on the predictability of the outcome of ecological restoration measures and the societal position of restoration ecology as a science. Scientists hold different views on the predictability of restoration measures. A fact is that the predictability of ecosystem development increases, with increasing knowledge of the underlying environmental processes.

Influence of barrens restoration treatments on soil carbon, nitrogen, and mercury pools and emissions	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Currently barrens communities only represent about 1% of their original area in the Great Lakes region. To maintain or restore barrens vegetation, prescribed fire is often applied to limit the regeneration of undesirable species and shrubs. Vegetation community response is a combination of direct fire effects on the vegetation vitality and the indirect effect of soil nitrogen (N) loss that favors nutrient-poor adapted barren communities. In this study, we assessed forest floor and upper mineral soil (0-5 cm) pools of carbon (C), N, and mercury (Hg) before and after prescribed fire of the Moquah Barrens in northwest Wisconsin. Although we took measurements in four distinct cover types, we found no relationship between cover type and soil pools. Across all cover types, prescribed fire led to considerable emissions of C, N, and Hg in the forest floor but only Hg in the upper mineral soils (0-5 cm), presumably because maximum fire temperatures were met for Hg volatilization. We classified fire severity and soil surface temperatures at the quadrat scale, but no discernable relationships with emissions were observed. The lack of detectable relationships is likely the result of a mismatch between the scales of response variables and predictors. As a result, we calculated ecosystem-scale fire emissions based on the total area burned because we could not discern other smaller scale predictors. Overall emissions from dormant, spring season prescribed fires at the Moquah Barrens were approximately 11,000 Mg (5.5 Mg ha-1) for C, 350 Mg for N (0.17 Mg ha-1), and 4,500 g for Hg (2.3 g ha-1). Imperiled barrens communities only represent a small area of their original distribution. As a result of the decrease in barrens habitat, associated fauna and flora are also in decline. Prescribed fire is used to maintain or restore barrens ecosystems. Fire leads to the changes in soil carbon, nitrogen, and mercury pools and leads to associated emissions. Emissions from the Moquah Barrens prescribed fires were minor and did lead to the goal of decreasing soil nitrogen.

The concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) method was used to calculate the SDS frequency from the discrete station data and to track the large-scale regional SDS weather processes in Northeast Asia. A spline trend analysis method was employed to investigate the variability of the SDS weather systems. The results show that during 1980-2011, the SDS weather processes exhibit both a historical persistence and abrupt transitions with an approximate 10-yr high-low occurrence oscillation. Through composite analysis of atmospheric circulation during high and low SDS years, it is found that the SDS occurrences are closely related to the anomalies of arctic vortex and midlatitude westerly, and the circulation patterns around the Lake Baikal. During the high frequency years, the meridianal flows in the upper and mid troposphere above the high SDS corridor in East Asia (from the Lake Balkhash along Northwest and North China, Korean Peninsula, and Japan Islands) are apparently stronger than the meridianal flows during the low SDS frequency years, favoring the development and transport of SDSs in the midlatitude regions.																			0894-0525	2191-4788				FEB	2013	27	1					119	127		10.1007/s13351-013-0112-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-013-0112-0													WOS:000314862300011
J	Broady, PA; Weinstein, RN				Broady, PA; Weinstein, RN			Algae, lichens and fungi in La Gorce Mountains, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Two species of lichens, six cyanobacteria, one diatom, 10 chlorophytes and two mycelial fungi were found at La Gorce Mountains (86 degrees 30'S, 147 degrees W) at an altitude of about 1750 m. The lichens Lecidea cancriformis and Carbonea vorticosa occurred at a single site which is the most southerly record of lichens. Thousands of small ponds covered extensive ice-cored moraine. Nine ponds sampled had about 30 cm of ice overlying about 26 cm of water and contained algal mats dominated by Phormidium autumnale and cf. Leptolyngbya fragilis. The very low conductivity waters had high nitrate and low dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations. Of 124 soil samples, five contained visible algae. In 32 there were only microscopic growths but no algae were detected in 87 samples, possibly because of lack of water for much of summer. A visible mat dominated by Hammatoidea normanni occurred in a rock fissure at the lichen site. At Price Bluff, green patches of Desmococcus cf. olivaceus, up to 20 cm(2), were scattered over the moraine. Growths were revealed at the soil-ice interface when overlying soil up to one centimetre thick was removed. It is suggested that although dispersal of algae from local populations maybe readily achieved establishment of populations is a rare event outside the pond environment.																			0954-1020					DEC	1998	10	4					376	385		10.1017/S0954102098000467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102098000467													WOS:000077839300003

(Petromyzontiformes, Petromyzontidae) Ammocoetes and Diversity of Their Habitats in a Small Flat River of the Baltic Sea Basin	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The resident nonparasitic lamprey Eudontomyzon sp., which differs from the only species of this genus known in the Baltic basin (Ukrainian lamprey E. mariae (Berg, 1931)), inhabits the Ilzhitsa River (drainage basin of the Western Dvina River). Eudontomyzon sp. larvae have been collected and the conditions of their habitat in the summer low water are identified. Abiotic and biotic characteristics of habitats are studied. The results of a morphological analysis of the river channel makes it possible to distinguish five types of biotopes: sediment in holes of the river bends (I), the sandy bottom on the straight regions of the river (II), the sediment in the pipes under the bridge (III), the sand and gravel spawning ground (IV), and the sediment at the river mouth (V). A study of the population density of lamprey larvae has made it possible to distinguish the most (I) and least (I, II, V) populated types of biotopes. An analysis of data on benthic communities has demonstrated that chironomids are the most typical representatives in the biotopes. This information complements the knowledge about the habitats of lamprey larvae with information about benthic communities in them and expand the existing classifications of habitats.

Nitrogen inputs drive nitrogen concentrations in US streams and rivers during summer low flow conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological and human health impairments related to excess nitrogen (N) in streams and rivers remain widespread in the United States (U.S.) despite recent efforts to reduce N pollution. Many studies have quantified the relationship between N loads to streams in terms of N mass and N inputs towatersheds; however, N concentrations, rather than loads, are more closely related to impacts on human health and aquatic life. Additionally, concentrations, rather than loads, trigger regulatory responses. In this study, we examined how N concentrations are related to N inputs towatersheds (atmospheric deposition, synthetic fertilizer, manure applied to agricultural land, cultivated biological N fixation, and point sources), land cover characteristics, and stream network characteristics, including stream size and the extent of lakes and reservoirs. N concentration data were collected across the conterminous U.S. during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2008-09 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (n = 1966). Median watershed N inputs were 15.7 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Atmospheric deposition accounted for over half the N inputs in 49% of watersheds, but watersheds with the highest N input rates were dominated by agriculture-related sources. Total N input to watersheds explained 42% and 38% of the variability in total N and dissolved inorganic N concentrations, respectively. Land cover characteristics were also important predictors, with wetland cover muting the effect of agricultural N inputs on N concentrations and riparian disturbance exacerbating it. In contrast, stream variables showed little correlation with N concentrations. This suggests that terrestrial factors that can be managed, such as agricultural N use practices and wetland or riparian areas, control the spatial variability in stream N concentrations across the conterminous U.S. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mean density of the mussel in this low-gradient, sand-bottomed stream was 2.5 individuals/m(2) and biomass was 3.4 g dry mass/m(2). About 87% of the population had a shell length of 6-9 cm, or age of 4-6 years. Only 11% of the population was less than four years old; the age of the oldest individuals encountered was only eight years. Distribution of the mussels was highly clumped, but no physical, chemical, or hydrologic factors examined were significantly correlated with mussel abundance. All young mussels (age < three years) were burrowed into the sediment, whereas older individuals occurred both below and at the sediment surface, depending on time of year. About 90% of the population was burrowed below the surface during the winter, but a high of 80% of the mussels moved to the surface in March and April, the time of peak reproductive activity. Tagged mussels moved an average of 2.9 m during one year. Although the direction of those movements was erratic, the overall movement of the population was a net 27 cm downstream, indicating no directed upstream movement to compensate for downstream displacement during storms.																			0270-5060					SEP	1995	10	3					255	268		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663445													WOS:A1995RZ11300007

Here we report discovery of two novel isolates, P102 and P117 from the freshwater Lake Winnipeg, each with violet to deep purple colony colouration. The relationship between pigment production and growth was investigated under different conditions, including a variety of carbon sources, pH, and temperatures. The violet compounds were purified using polar organic solvents, and then structurally characterized via mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to be violacein and deoxyviolacein. Strain P117 produced higher concentrations of the darker pigment deoxyviolacein, which resulted in a deeper hue of violet than in cultures of P102. Strain P102, synthesized violacein maximally in liquid rich organic medium at pH 8 and 20 degrees C, and had 99.3% sequence similarity to the 16S rDNA from Janthinobacterium lividum. Strain P117, related to Massilia violaceinigra sharing 99.2% 16S rDNA sequence similarity, also produced violacein at similar optimal conditions, but developed higher concentrations of pigment at 15 degrees C. Culture-based methods found that violacein producers composed 0.001% or 0.023% CFU of environmental heterotrophic populations using BG-11 and potato-based media, respectively. Cultureindependent high-throughput ribosomal 16S V4 sequencing of environmental DNA was used to detect Gram-negative species known for their production of violacein. Of all bacterial and archaeal sequences present during the fall in littoral waters and sediment of Lake Winnipeg, 5.5% and 6.3%, respectively, belonged to species that have similar pigment, demonstrating the scarcity of violacein producers in this aquatic freshwater system.

Sinninghe			The Holocene sedimentary record of cyanobacterial glycolipids in the Baltic Sea: an evaluation of their application as tracers of past nitrogen fixation	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Heterocyst glycolipids (HGs) are lipids exclusively produced by heterocystous dinitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. The Baltic Sea is an ideal environment to study the distribution of HGs and test their potential as biomarkers because of its recurring summer phytoplankton blooms, dominated by a few heterocystous cyanobacterial species of the genera Nodularia and Aphanizomenon. A multi-core and a gravity core from the Gotland Basin were analyzed to determine the abundance and distribution of a suite of selected HGs at a high resolution to investigate the changes in past cyanobacterial communities during the Holocene. The HG distribution of the sediments deposited during the Modern Warm Period (MoWP) was compared with those of cultivated heterocystous cyanobacteria, including those isolated from Baltic Sea waters, revealing high similarity. However, the abundance of HGs dropped substantially with depth, and this may be caused by either a decrease in the occurrence of the cyanobacterial blooms or diagenesis, resulting in partial destruction of the HGs. The record also shows that the HG distribution has remained stable since the Baltic turned into a brackish semi-enclosed basin similar to 7200 cal. yr BP. This suggests that the heterocystous cyanobacterial species composition remained relatively stable as well. During the earlier freshwater phase of the Baltic (i.e., the Ancylus Lake and Yoldia Sea phases), the distribution of the HGs varied much more than in the subsequent brackish phase, and the absolute abundance of HGs was much lower than during the brackish phase. This suggests that the cyanobacterial community adjusted to the different environmental conditions in the basin. Our results confirm the potential of HGs as a specific biomarker of heterocystous cyanobacteria in paleo-environmental studies.					; Sollai, Martina/HIK-0819-2022; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Sollai, Martina/P-2197-2017; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011	Bale, Nicole/0000-0001-9118-3890; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Hopmans, Ellen/0000-0002-8209-1334; Sollai, Martina/0000-0002-8400-7837; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				DEC 22	2017	14	24					5789	5804		10.5194/bg-14-5789-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5789-2017													WOS:000418684600002

High-resolution TOC content, magnetic susceptibility, and major element composition data indicate that Jeju Island experienced the coldest climate around 18,000 cat yr BP, which corresponds to the last glacial maximum (LGM). Further, these multi-proxy data show an abrupt Shift in climatic regime from cold and and to warm and humid conditions at around 14,000 cal yr BP, which represents the commencement of the last major deglaciation. After the last major deglaciation, the TOC content decreased from 13,300 to 12,000 cal yr BP and from 11,500 to 9800 cat yr BP, thereby reflecting the weakening of the summer monsoon. The LGM in Jeju Island occurred later in comparison with the Chinese Loess Plateau. Such a disparity in climatic change events between central China and Jeju Island appears to be caused by the asynchrony between the coldest temperature event and the minimum precipitation event in central China and by the buffering effect of the Pacific Ocean.

The thermophilic bacteria hydrolyzing agar: Characterization of thermostable agarase	APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND MICROBIOLOGY												Three strains of anaerobic thermophilic bacteria capable of growing on agarose as a source of energy and carbon were isolated from hot springs near Lake Baikal (Barguzin National Park) and the caldera Uzon (Kamchatka). Cells of all the three strains were spore bacilli with peritrichous flagellation. These isolates grew at a temperature of 55-60 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0 and fermented a wide range of organic substrates. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences allowed us to ascribe the strains B5 and K14 to the genus Thermoanaerobacter and the strain K67 to the genus Caldoanaerobacter. According to the results of DNA-DNA hybridization, B5 was determined as belonging to the species Thermoanaerobacter wiegelii. Agarase was isolated by preparative PAGE and subsequent gel chromatography from the culture liquid of strain B5 grown on the medium containing 0.5% agarose and 0.3% galactose. The molecular weight of this enzyme amounted to 67 kDa and pI, to 4.2. The T. wiegelii B5 agarase was active in the pH range of 3.5 to 7.0 (optimum, 5.2) and temperature range of 50 to 80 degrees C (optimum, 70 degrees C). The preincubation of this enzyme at 90 degrees C for 60 min did not reduce the agarase activity. This activity increased in the presence of metal ions; the maximal effect was observed in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+ and 25 mM Co2+.

Change in Forest Tree Composition on the Lake Erie Islands due to the Invasion of the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) and Invasive Plants	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Since its initial invasion in 2002, Agrilus planipennis (Emerald Ash Borer [EAB ]) has devastated Fraxinus (ash) species in forest communities of the Midwestern United States. The forests of the Lake Erie Islands have a unique composition that is typically divided into 2 categories: upland forests, which have rockier soil and bedrock above lake level, and lowland forests, which have deeper soil and bedrock below lake level. We used plot-sampling methods in selected wooded preserves of both upland and lowland forests on South Bass and North Bass islands, OH. We compared our findings with data collected on those 2 islands as well as Middle Bass and Kelleys islands in previous studies from before infestation, during initial infestation in the 2000s, and approximately one decade later to monitor ash loss and to determine which species were regenerating in these new canopy gaps. We calculated importance values and subsequent Boerner values through determination of relative frequency, relative coverage, and relative density of individual tree species within study plots. Fraxinus pennsylvanica (Green Ash) was most negatively impacted by the EAB while Fraxinus quadrangulata (Blue Ash) was still important in upland forests due to regeneration seen in small saplings. Lonicera maackii (Amur Honeysuckle) began filling in canopy gaps in upland forests and lowland forests, while invasive species like Morus alba (White Mulberry), Rhamnus cathartica (Common Buckthorn), and Elaeagnus umbellata (Autumn Olive) filled in the canopy gaps of lowland woods. The decline in ash populations due to the EAB has allowed for further growth of numerous invasive plant species and transformed the composition of Lake Erie Island forests.

Atmospheric CO2 Exchange of a Small Mountain Lake: Limitations of Eddy Covariance and Boundary Layer Modeling Methods in Complex Terrain	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes receive and transform significant amounts of terrestrial carbon and are often considered a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Yet, continuous direct measurements of lake-atmosphere CO2 exchange with high temporal resolution are sparse. In this study, we measured the CO2 exchange of a mountain lake in the eastern Austrian Alps continuously for one year using the eddy covariance (EC) and the boundary layer model (BLM) approaches. Results from both the EC and the BLM methods indicated the lake to be a small source of atmospheric CO2 with highest emissions in fall. EC flux measurements were affected by low-frequency contributions especially during low wind conditions. The CO2 concentration gradient at the air-water interface decreased during night-time due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 above the lake, likely caused by cold and CO2-rich air draining from the surrounding land. Consequently, BLM fluxes were lower during night-time than during daytime. This diel pattern was lacking in the EC flux measurements because the EC instruments deployed at the shore of the lake did not capture low nocturnal lake CO2 fluxes due to the local wind regime. Overall, this study illustrates the effect of the surrounding landscape on lake-atmosphere flux measurements. We conclude that estimating CO2 evasion from lakes situated in complex topography needs to explicitly account for biases in EC flux measurements caused by low-frequency contributions and local wind regimes.

We investigated the population genetic structure of the free-living marine nematode Pellioditis marina. A total of 426 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene were surveyed on a geographical scale of approximately 100 km during spring 2003. Nematodes were collected from 2 coastal locations in Belgium, and from 2 estuaries and a saltwater lake (Lake Grevelingen) in The Netherlands. Molecular variation was assessed with the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method. In total, 32 different haplotypes were observed, and sequence divergence among 452 individuals ranged from 0.2 to 10.6%. We discovered 4 distinct mitochondrial lineages, with low divergences within the lineages (0.2 to 1.6%) and high divergences between the lineages (5.1 to 10.6%). The nuclear ribosomal ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region showed concordant phylogenetic patterns, suggesting that nematode species diversity may be considerably underestimated. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a strong genetic differentiation among populations. The Lake Grevelingen population was clearly differentiated from all other populations, but genetic structuring was also significant within the Westerschelde and was correlated with gradients in salinity and pollution. The observed population genetic structure is in accordance with the limited active dispersal capacity of P. marina, but is at variance with its significant potential for passive dispersal. We therefore suggest that autecological characteristics, including short generation time, high colonization potential and local adaptation, may be at the basis of this nematode's population genetic structure.

Community membership included Myxobolus sp. A (intracellular in striated muscle fibers), Myxobolus sp. B (intracellular in striated muscle fibers), Myxobolus sp. C (brain), and Thelohanellus notatus (Mavor, 1916) Kudo, 1929 (loose connective tissue), all of which are histozoic myxobolids displaying strict tissue specificity for trophozoite development. Mean infracommunity richness in fish at the separate localities was estimated to be 0.4 +/- 0.5 to 1.3 +/- 0.7, with a maximum richness of 3 in any 1 fish. Component community richness in host samples was 2 to 4. It is argued that these are relatively high levels of diversity for freshwater fish parasites but that the values are probably conservative because of the study of only portions of individual fish. The percentage of fish infected with myxozoans of any species and infracommunity richness was significantly greater below the island of Montreal compared with above it. It is suspected that increased oligochaete populations at these sites, resulting from sewage-caused organic enrichment of sediments, may have accounted for the observed increased prevalence of infection.

These freshwater ecosystems are an important resource for migrating seabirds that use them and leave there their droppings and feathers, contributing to enrich the water with organic matter. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are long-range transported to polar regions and their detection in the Antarctic ecosystems date back to the 1960s. Most studies have been related to POP concentrations in marine environment, and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly investigated. This study reports the concentration of PBDEs (23 congeners) and PCBs (21 among non-, mono-, di-, and ortho congeners) in lake sediment, soil and vegetation mat (community of algae, cyanobacteria, bryophites) collected close to six lakes in the Victoria Land (74 degrees 31'S-74 degrees 97'S, 165 degrees 07'E-162 degrees 51'E): Edmonson Point 14 and 15A, Carezza, Enigma, Tarn Flat 20, Inexpressible Island 10B. The Sigma PBDEs averaged 0.09-0.28 ng/g and BDEs 28, 47 and 154 were higher in mat and soils, while BDEs 183 and 47 in sediment samples. PCBs ranged <0.003-0.807 ng/g and congeners nos. 114, 138, and 187 were the most abundant. In addition, TEQs were derived for the non-and mono-ortho PCBs detected and values were very low in each matrix (0.010 pg/g in the soil, 0.012 pg/g in sediment and mat). The long-range atmospheric transport can be confirmed as the most important POP source in Antarctica, although the scientific stations and seabird colonies may be potential local sources and contribute to contaminant release.

We evaluated concentration changes in a suite of BFRs, including 13 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), in air at Toolik Lake, Arctic Alaska during the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2013. A high-volume active air sampler was used to collect 2 day integrated samples at the field station and three flow-through air samplers were used to collect 18 day integrated samples along a transect extending away from the field station. The BDE congeners associated with the penta-BDE commercial mixture (BDE-47, -99, and -100) were the most frequently detected BFRs and were found at concentrations consistent with those reported at other Arctic sites. Gas-particle distributions were influenced by temperature and correlations between gas-phase concentrations and temperature suggested that either volatilization from local sources or re-emission from secondary sources (that is, re-volatilization of BFRs that had migrated northwards from distant sources) was important for the lower-brominated BFRs during the warmer months. Source indicator analysis suggested no single dominant geographic source of BFRs while results from the flow-through samplers indicated that the field station itself was not a significant source of BFRs.					; Hung, Hayley/AAS-2215-2021; Davie-Martin, Cleo/AGJ-5787-2022	Davie-Martin, Cleo/0000-0002-3710-8715; 													2050-7887	2050-7895					2016	18	10					1274	1284		10.1039/c6em00395h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6em00395h								27602544					WOS:000386230300003
J	Anttila, S; Kairesalo, T				Anttila, Saku; Kairesalo, Timo			Mean and variance estimations with different pixel sizes: case study in a small water quality monitoring area in southern Finland	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Spatial variation of water quality parameters produces inaccuracy in freshwater monitoring programs. Using spatially continuous measurements, such as remote sensing observations, this variation can be estimated. However, spaceborne remote sensing data that are usable for the operative monitoring of lake water quality suffer from coarse spatial resolution. Observations in small monitoring regimes are often restricted to only a few satellite image pixels that are not disturbed by the adjacent land areas. Consequently, it is often assumed that a medium- to coarse-resolution remote sensing does not contribute additional information for monitoring programs in these areas. The usability of pixel-type observations in a small monitoring area was assessed using a flow-through fluorometer in a moving boat. Nine spatially extensive data sets were collected from the Enonselka basin of Vesijarvi in southern Finland during the summers of 2005-2007. The effect of spatial resolution on the observed mean and standard deviation of the chlorophyll-a concentration was studied. The Getis-Ord Gi* analysis and spatial interpolation were used to define surface areas of locations, where chlorophyll-a concentration varied from the mean concentration. Our results suggest that the mean value can be estimated with reasonable accuracy even with a single pixel observation. The information of the variation is, however, lost with the coarser resolution observations.

Experimental passage of adult male Gulf sturgeon around Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam on the Apalachicola River, Florida	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Dams can impede access to habitats that are required for the completion of life history phases of many migratory fish species, including anadromous sturgeons. Various forms of fish passage have been developed to permit migratory fishes to move above dams, but many dams still lack such structures. Translocation of ripe, mature fish above dams has been used as a first step to determine the efficacy of potential fish passage systems. The anadromous Gulf sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi, inhabits the Gulf of Mexico and coastal rivers from Florida to Louisiana, and requires upriver spawning habitats to complete its life cycle. Historic overfishing and other anthropogenic threats, including dam construction, led to species declines and subsequent listing as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In the Apalachicola River, FL, the 1957 completion of Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) created Lake Seminole and blocked Gulf Sturgeon from accessing 78% of historic riverine habitat-including potential spawning habitat-in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the efficacy of passage around JWLD through the trap-and-transport of 10 male Gulf sturgeon from the Apalachicola River to the reservoir above the dam. Through the use of acoustic telemetry, we were able to assess the ability of these fish to navigate Lake Seminole, access potentially suitable spawning habitat in the Flint and River, and complete their seasonal outmigration to the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, 2 translocated sturgeon moved 69 km upstream into potential spawning habitat in the Flint River, but 6 fish fell back through the lock/spill gates at JWLD within days of translocation. Four sturgeon appeared to remain trapped in the reservoir, and their long-term survival was deemed unlikely. Given our low sample size, and examination of male fish only, we cannot conclude that a trap-and-transport program would ultimately fail to restore spawning above JWLD, but our findings suggest that the risk of adult mortality is nontrivial. Alternatively, we suggest future studies examine the population level trade-offs associated with translocation of adults or consider alternatives such as a head-start program to rear and release juvenile sturgeon above JWLD to study viability of their passage in addition to effects on overall recruitment in the population.

J	Winkler, G; Sirois, P; Johnson, LE; Dodson, JJ				Winkler, G; Sirois, P; Johnson, LE; Dodson, JJ			Invasion of an estuarine transition zone by Dreissena polymorpha veligers had no detectable effect on zooplankton community structure	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Large numbers of the filter-feeding larval stage of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) (veligers) have been advected into the estuarine transition zone (ETZ) of the St. Lawrence River. In 1994, they became the dominant member of the tidal freshwater zooplankton assemblage of the ETZ (and subsequently the true estuarine assemblage) during summer months. These changes in community structure have not, however, been reflected in changes in the abundance of preinvasion taxa. Abundance of potential planktonic competitors such as rotifers and the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris fluctuated between years but did not decline following the invasion. Only densities of the copepod Eurytemora affinis declined in 2000 and 2001, but this could not be definitively associated with the invasion. Synchronous variation among different zooplankton groups suggests that environmental forcing related to or correlated with temperature anomalies is the major cause of interannual variation in the abundance of zooplankton taxa. The negative correlation between veliger abundance and salinity indicates that the ETZ acts as a sink for the larval stages of the zebra mussel. Their precise fate remains uncertain, but our study suggests that this invasion has had little or no impact on this pelagic community in spite of the numerical dominance of veligers.

This system does not require back-washing because the fluidized-bed suffers no clogging. Moreover, the system uses dissolved oxygen in the influent water for aerobic biological treatment without the need for additional aeration equipment. This, it is an easy-maintenance, low-energy system for purifying eutrophic lake water. The system was operated continuously at a Row rate of 1500 m(3)/d for nine months at Tsuchiura Port in Lake Kasumigaura. And concentrations of chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen in both the influent and effluent water were continuously monitored, In summer (August to September) when water bloom occurred, the average efficiency of chlorophyll-a removal was 64% at an average influent chlorophyll-a concentration of 137.8 mug/L. Over the entire experimental period of nine months, the average daily amount of removed chlorophyll-a was 40.3 gld at an average influent chlorophyll-a concentration of 89.5 mug/L. By anlayzing the relationship between the amount of removed chlorophyll-a and the consumption of dissolved oxygen, it was estimated that almost all of the algae trapped in the reactor was biologically degraded.																			0273-1223						2001	43	1					277	283		10.2166/wst.2001.0058	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2001.0058								11379102					WOS:000167316800034
J	Millar, CI; Woolfenden, WB				Millar, CI; Woolfenden, WB			The role of climate change in interpreting historical variability	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS					Annual Meeting of the Ecological-Society-of-America	1997	ALBUQUERQUE, NM	Ecol Soc Amer				Significant climate anomalies have characterized the last 1000 yr in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Two warm, dry periods of 150- and 200-yr duration occurred during AD 900-1350, which were followed by anomalously cold climates, known as the Little Ice Age, that lasted from AD 1400 to 1900. Climate in the last century has been significantly warmer. Regional biotic and physical response to these climatic periods occurred. Climate variability presents challenges when interpreting historical variability, including the need to accommodate climate effects when comparing current ecosystems to historical conditions, especially if comparisons are done to evaluate causes (e.g., human impacts) of differences, or to develop models for restoration of current ecosystems. Many historical studies focus on "presettlement" periods, which usually fall within the Little Ice Age. Thus, it should be assumed that ecosystems inferred for these historical periods responded to different climates than those at present, and management implications should be adjusted accordingly. The warmer centuries before the Little Ice Age may be a more appropriate analogue to the present, although no historic period is likely to be better as a model than an understanding of what conditions would be at present without intervention. Understanding the climate context of historical reconstruction studies, and adjusting implications to the present, should strengthen the value of historical variability research to management.																			1051-0761					NOV	1999	9	4					1207	1216		10.1890/1051-0761(1999)009[1207:TROCCI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(1999)009[1207:TROCCI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000083684700012
J	Hagman, CHC; Rohrlack, T; Riise, G				Hagman, Camilla Hedlund Corneliussen; Rohrlack, Thomas; Riise, Gunnhild			The success of Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae) in a boreal lake is due to environmental changes rather than a recent invasion	LIMNOLOGICA												The freshwater microalgal species, Gonyostomum semen, has increased in abundance and distribution in boreal lakes during the past few decades, concerning ecologists and water managers. Due to its rapid spread, G. semen has often been referred to as an invasive species, although it was first described in the 1800s. We hypothesized that G. semen is not an invasive species in Norwegian lakes, and that the increasing success is due to beneficial changes in environmental conditions for this species during the past century. We tested these hypotheses by performing a paleolimnological study of a Norwegian Lake, Skjeklesjoen, with known mass occurrence of G. semen. A specific G. semen pigment biomarker, heteroxanthin, was used to detect this species in layers of a sediment core with known age determinations. Environmental factors in both lake and catchment were further investigated and the relationships with the amounts of G. semen was tested. Our results suggested that G. semen was in fact not an invasive species in this lake the past decades. Several factors were identified as plausible drivers for G. semen in this boreal lake. Between 1874-2016, the increasing levels of G. semen in Lake Skjeklesjoen was most closely correlated with Carbon (C), lake color (measured as absorbance of sediment extracts), Nitrogen (N) and spring temperature. Our results suggest that the rapid increase in G. semen population in this boreal lake over the past 70 years was probably due to a combination of climate change and local anthropogenic activities in the catchment, causing increased browning and increased inputs of organic matter and nutrients.

John; Yang, Xiangdong; Xu, Min			Interactions between climate change and early agriculture in SW China and their effect on lake ecosystem functioning at centennial timescales over the last 2000 years	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The responses of alpine lake ecosystems to combined climate and human impacts are ecologically important to understand. It is necessary to differentiate natural, climate-forced ecosystem changes from those driven by human disturbance with a long-term (i.e. 10(2)-10(3-)yr) perspective. Here a(14)C, Pb-210 and 137Cs- dated sediment core covering approximately 2500 years was analyzed for diatoms, pigments, cladocerans and geochemistry in Lugu lake-catchment in southwest China to examine the response of the lake to climate change and human impacts. Between 1000 and 1300 AD, a warming climate coupled with declining summer monsoon precipitation resulted in the increase of oligotrophic taxa and low catchment runoff. Prior to 1300 AD the lake ecosystem was primarily responding to natural, regional climate-related processes. After 1300 AD, the clear ecological shifts and reorganizations in community structure across multiple trophic levels suggest that major transitions took place in the Lugu ecosystem. An increase in Poaceae (grass) pollen from 1300 AD indicates human settlement in the area, and is followed by rapid decline in Tsuga, most likely a consequence of logging. Use of change point analyses of the multi-proxy data demonstrate that the lake ecosystem has been highly variable since 1300 AD and exhibiting enhanced vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Our results suggest that agriculture-climate interactions played a major role in the ecological transitions over the last similar to 700 years. This conclusion provides insight into how the anthropogenic land-use intensity, vegetation cover and surface erosion fluctuated with natural temperature and precipitation change over the past 2000 years.

J	Ball, JL				Ball, Jessica L.			Stratigraphy and eruption history of maars in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, California	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The Clear Lake Volcanic Field (CLVF) is the northernmost and youngest field in a chain of volcanic fields in the California Coast Range mountains. Effusive and explosive volcanic activity in the field has spanned at least 2.1 million years, with the youngest eruptions comprising a series of maar craters at the edges of, and within, Clear Lake itself. This work documents the first direct ages for many of these maar deposits and builds the stratigraphic basis for interpreting eruptive processes and dynamics of the young eruptions which produced them. Detailed stratigraphy has distinguished maar eruption products from pyroclastic deposits (monolithologic falls and flows, previously mapped together with maars as a single unit) and established a set of six eruption facies from maar deposit lithology, grain size parameters, and depositional structures. Radiocarbon dates from carbon films found on clasts at three outcrops have constrained several of these maar eruptions to & SIM;8,500-13,500 years BP, coinciding with eruptive periods previously estimated based on lake core tephrachronology. Part of this period also coincides with indigenous inhabitation (< 12,000 years BP), which suggests that oral histories of Pomo and other local tribes may contain descriptions of volcanic phenomena experienced by local residents of the CLVF. Collaboration between volcanologists and indigenous historians may add a valuable human dimension to the youngest eruptions of the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, and help inform future volcanic hazard assessment.

J	Grausgruber, EE; Weber, MJ				Grausgruber, Emily Elise; Weber, Michael John			Is Bigger Better? Evaluation of Size-Selective Predation on Age-0 Walleye	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The success of fish stocking programs is dependent on poststocking survival. However, survival can be influenced by size-selective mortality, where larger individuals are expected to be less vulnerable to predation. Walleye Sander vitreus is a commonly stocked sport fish, but little is known regarding the role of size-selective predation on age-0 Walleye (90-290 mm TL) that are stocked in the presence of various piscivores with different foraging strategies and morphological features. Our objective was to evaluate whether the TL of consumed age-0 Walleye was related to predator TL, predator gape height, or the probability of predation. We also assessed whether length distributions varied among stocked, recaptured, and consumed age-0 Walleye. Data for the food habits of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu, Northern Pike Esox lucius, adult Walleye, and Muskellunge Esox masquinongy were collected from East Okoboji Lake and West Okoboji Lake, Iowa, USA during fall 2015-2017. Over the course of the study, 301 age-0 Walleye were recovered from 3,514 predator stomachs. Mean, maximum (85th percentile), and minimum (15th percentile) TL of the consumed age-0 Walleye were not related to the TL or gape height of the predators (P > 0.05), but the probability of predation decreased by 0.02 for every 10-mm increase in the TL of the age-0 Walleye. The length distributions indicated that consumed Walleye were generally smaller, whereas recaptured Walleye tended to be larger than stocked fish were. Our approach to evaluating poststocking size-selective predation on age-0 Walleye furthers the current understanding of the importance of size at stocking relative to stocking success and suggests that stocking Walleye > 220 mm is economically advantageous for reducing predation risk.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2020	40	3					726	732		10.1002/nafm.10437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10437		APR 2020											WOS:000528769900001

Iceberg and ice-keel ploughmarks on the Gdansk-Gotland Sill (south-eastern Baltic Sea)	GEO-MARINE LETTERS					35th International Geological Congress (IGC)	AUG 27-SEP 04, 2016	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA					New interpretation of the undulating moraine relief of the Gdansk-Gotland Sill, Baltic Sea is proposed. Relict iceberg and ice-keel ploughmarks were observed based on the integration of recently acquired side-scan sonar, multi-beam, single-beam and lithological data. The most likely time of their formation is the period of fast Scandinavian sheet retreat occurring from approximately 13.2 to 11.7 ka. Weak erosional-accumulative processes on the sill from 11.7 ka until the present favoured preservation of the iceberg ploughmarks. The predominant directions of the ploughmarks (north-south and northwest-southeast) coincide with the major iceberg (ice) drift direction from the Scandinavian ice sheet. Furrow width varies from 1 to 300 m with a main width of 20-60 m in a depth range of 1 to 10 m (mostly 2-4 m depth). The ploughmarks are flanked by side ridges 0.5-2 m high, and there is a push mound at the end of some furrows. Three types of cross-sectional furrow profiles have been distinguished: V-shaped cross-section profiles would have been formed by a peaked iceberg keel, U-shaped profiles by a flat keel, and W-shaped profiles by double-keel icebergs (ice ridges). The wide local depressions at the end of ploughmarks could have been formed during periods of fast falling of the Baltic Ice Lake water level, when the ice ridges (stamukhi) or icebergs could ground into the seafloor.					; Dorohov, Dmitriy/L-1553-2016; Sivkov, Vadim/F-6806-2016; Dorokhova, Evgenia/L-3075-2016; Dorokhov, Dmitry/E-9060-2018	Sivkov, Vadim/0000-0003-1602-1298; Dorokhova, Evgenia/0000-0002-0079-7342; Dorokhov, Dmitry/0000-0003-1226-8429													0276-0460	1432-1157				FEB	2018	38	1			SI		83	94		10.1007/s00367-017-0517-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00367-017-0517-3													WOS:000422846600007

Here we present stable isotope and trace metal data from two Lehman Caves, NV speleothems that provide a well-dated record of latest Pleistocene to mid-Holocene hydroclimate in the U.S. Great Basin. Together the stalagmites span the interval between 16.4 ka and 3.8 ka, with a hiatus from 15.0 ka to 12.7 ka. Mg/Ca and delta C-13 covary throughout the records, consistent with control by the extent of degassing and prior calcite precipitation (PCP); measurements of modern cave and soil waters support PCP as the primary control on drip-water trace-element composition. We therefore interpret Mg/Ca and delta C-13 as reflecting infiltration rates, with higher values corresponding to drier periods. Both Mg/Ca and delta C-13 indicate a wet period at the beginning of the record (12.7-8.2 ka) followed by pronounced drying after 8.2 ka. This mid-Holocene drying is consistent with records from around the western United States, including a new compilation of Great Basin lake-level records. The strong temporal correspondence with the collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet over Hudson Bay suggests that this drying may have been triggered by northward movement of the winter storm track as a result of ice sheet retreat. However, we cannot rule out an alternative hypothesis that wet early Holocene conditions are related to equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperature. Regardless, our results suggest that Great Basin water balance in the early Holocene was driven by factors other than orbital changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After restoration, the vegetation of the swamp, swamp meadow, and meadow in the transitional zone improved constantly, as well as the soil properties, such as water content, soil organic matter, and TN. The vegetation in the lakeside zone increased from 10 families, 11 genera, and 14 species before the restoration to 15 families, 21 genera, and 26 species after the restoration. The removal rate of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand in the wetland remained greater than 45, 80, and 55 %, respectively; and the transparency in the outlet of the lake increased 171.1 %. Due to the improvement of habitats, the species and number of wintering water birds increased considerably. According to a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), the soil water content, soil organic matter, total phosphorus and pH were the most important factors that influenced the distribution of vegetation in the transitional zone. Based on the correlation analysis, the bird was positively correlated with the wetland age and the water quality. The evaluation results indicate that the restoration was effective and could act as a guideline for the further ecological restoration of alpine wetlands in the future.

Use of Artificial Eggs Reduces Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) Fledging	WATERBIRDS												Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations have rapidly grown across the United States. In some locations cormorant populations have become a management concern due to real or perceived effects on local fish populations. altering island vegetation, and displacing other colonial waterbirds. In north central Minnesota on Leech Lake cormorant populations have been reduced and managed by various removal and population reduction methods, which include fall nest material removal, lethal shooting, and limited harassment. These methods can be time intensive. costly, and can cause cormorants to disperse and renest. This study examines the use of artificial eggs as a new management method to reduce cormorant populations by limiting their fledging success. A portion of viable cormorant eggs from 68 nests were replaced and the nests monitored, and 32 nests were monitored as controls on an island nesting colony. Results demonstrate that cormorant fledging success is reduced by using artificial eggs. The average number of near fledge young per nest that received artificial eggs was 0.7 while control nests that did not receive artificial eggs had an average of 2.5 young per nest. Use of artificial eggs reduces cormorant fledging success and minimizes the chance of adults renesting elsewhere.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2019	42	2					225	230		10.1675/063.042.0210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.042.0210													WOS:000473158100010

Photodecomposition of Methylmercury in Atmospheric Waters	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												Experiments were conducted to empirically examine net changes in methylmercury concentration of atmospheric waters as function of irradiance. Methods were developed to allow experiments to be conducted at atmospherically relevant concentrations using trace metal clean techniques, over a range of aqueous matrices. Rain water was collected at Devil's Lake State Park, WI, and simulated cloud water was created by water extraction of particulate matter collected at the same site. These waters were spiked with methyl mercury chloride and mercuric chloride and exposed to sunlight on the roof of a building. Experiments were conducted during typical summer conditions with respect to temperature, sunlight intensity and sunlight duration. For all cases, exposure to sunlight resulted in net loss of methylmercury: -0.022 +/- 0.002 1/hr in rainwater at a total UVB flux of 8 kWhrs/m(2); -0.008 +/- 0.001 1/hr in simulated cloud water at a total UVB flux of 5.5 kWhrs/m(2). For dark cases, no statistically significant formation in methylmercury from inorganic mercury was detected. Furthermore, laboratory experiments to form methylmercury from mercuric-acetate complexes did not give detectable yields. Given the results of this study, and the results of studies cited in this article, it is unlikely that homogeneous MeHg formation is fast enough to lead to the net formation of MeHg in atmospheric waters exposed to sunlight.

Factors influencing release of phosphorus from sediments in a high productive polymictic lake system	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Phosphorus (P) release rates from bottom sediments are high (20.6 mg/m(2)/day) in Dal Lake (India), a polymictic hyper-eutrophic lake. These gross release rates occur over a period of 72 days during summer only. Likewise, a net internal load of 11.3 tons was obtained from mass balance estimates. Significant proportion i.e., similar to 80% of 287.3 tons/yr of nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)-N) load is either eliminated by denitrification or gets entrapped for a short period in high macrophyte biomass of 3.2 kg/m(2) f.w., which eventually get decomposed and nitrogen (N) is released back. These processes result in low lake water NO(3)-N concentrations which potentially influence sediment phosphorus (P) release. Especially, nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)-N) < 500 mu g/L in the lake waters were associated with high P concentrations. Phosphorus was also observed to increase significantly in relation to temperature and pH, and it seems likely that release of phosphorus and ammonical nitrogen (NH(4)-N) depend on decomposition of rich reserves of organic matter (893 tons d.w. in superficial 10-cm bottom sediment layer). Lake P concentrations were significantly predicted by a multivariate regression model developed for the lake. This study describes significance of various lake water variables in relation to P-release from bottom sediments.																			0273-1223						2009	60	4					1013	1023		10.2166/wst.2009.445	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.445								19700840					WOS:000269550700020

The geomorphological mapping and lacustrine systems evolution modelling between 2006-2011 were obtained with Quickbird (RGB432) image, application of the spatial digital filters in COSMO-SkyMed (cross and co-polarization, spotlight mode) images and topographic profiles visual interpretations. The methodology considered hypsometry, slope, contour and shaded relief maps of the peninsula, as. The Polar Club Glacier frontal variation between 1981-2015 was obtained with Landsat temporal analysis. The Potter Peninsula geomorphological mapping evidenced the proglacial and geomorphological processes and the spatial distribution pattern of linear marginal to ice features, as morainic ridges and glaciofluvial features, related to the contribution of the seasonal melting of snow and ice, marine terraces, ravines and rocky outcrops. The frontal glacier fluctuations modelling indicated that last glacial advance condition recorded by proglacial geomorphologic can be related Little Ice Age and continuous retreat process. Between 1981-2015 the Polar Club glacier lost 2.95km(2) of total area (9.4% of total area). The retreat process can be related to the trend of rising average temperatures in recent decades, trend of increase in days with liquid precipitation in summer and the number melting degree days in last decades. The Polar Club Glacier retreat is not very significant when compared to other glaciers of King George Island, however, when observing the exposed areas was evident that there was a significant increase (36.9%). The moraine deposits evolution analysis in Peninsula Potter provided conditions for identify three phases of moraines deposition and that show past glacier front positions during periods of glacier marginal stabilization. The analysis of the evolution of lacustrine systems in the study area evidenced changes in proglacial lakes during last 34 years in response of glacial retreat dynamics.

J	Toprakli, R				Toprakli, Ramazan			REVIEW MISTAKES ON THE HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY DUE TO EARTH CHANGES: WHERE ARE ALASEHIR AND LADIK ?	SELCUK UNIVERSITESI TURKIYAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-SELCUK UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN TURCOLOGY												After an eartquake* (or a series of earthquakes) occured during a war led by Mithridates at Apameia, lakes overflooded the lands and the plains which had no lakes or rivers before and and rivers and springs flooded. Meanwhile several existing springs and rivers totally disappeared. The quake mentioned above occured at circa 50 BC. Another big earthquake happened in 54 AD. (Arundel, 2013: 17-18). The last known earthquake happened in 1509 AD (Bocuzade, 2012; 483; Ambraseys-Finkel, 2006: 30). The area in which Uluborlu, Egirdir, Yalvac and Sarkikaraagac are situated was called Frigia Mi-nor. The Romans called Frigia Minor as Thema Thrakesia. Suleyman Sukru called Frigia Minor as Fricyatu's-sagir. Historical texts called the Egridir lake the Sea, and the plain between Gelendost and this Sea Kelbianos Plain. If we recall the geographical changes of the past, the Egridir lake existed as two parts; namely Egridir and Hoyran lakes. Two lakes joined in the beginning of the 17 th century AD and both the river and the bridge sunk into the water. Approximately 500 years earlier, certain changes of the earth around the Egridir lake occured. Upon understanding this reality, new views cocerning our history appeared and will continue to do so. As mentioned above the change was not the first one. Also, there was a 16-17 km long river called el-Battal, Halys or Meander with a bridge over it. At the Kemer Pass, the Kings Road, mentioned by Heredotus, ran over this bridge. Alasehir that is mentioned as Filadelfiya by Anna Komnena is Yalvac. The reason that the words Yalvac and Egridir were not used, is that at the time they were called Alasehir and Ladik. This study concludes that Yalvac was called Alesehir, (Antiochette or Minor Antioche, Antakya), Eg-ridir was called Ladik (Laodikia, Akrokos), Lampe was called Senirkent (Karaarslan, Arslan, el-Leys, Pankaleia) and Kelbianos plain lay between Gelendost and the Egridir lake. Yet we have been taught that Denizli was Ladik, Manisa Alasehir was Philadelphia. This grave error happens because people do know only one River Meander which today exist. They do not have any knowledge about the other River Meander which run between the lakes upon a time. Upon knowing this reality, all of the placements of the area have to be reviewed. During the two centuries of Seljuk reign, between 1100-1300, the area between Yalvac (Alasehir)-Egridir (Ladik); the deep river Meander running between two lakes and Kelbianos Plain, which has shores on both sides of the river was the place where Turkish-Roman and Turkoman-Mongol battles peaked.

J	Käsbohrer, F; Kuss, J				Kaesbohrer, Fabian; Kuss, Jochen			Lower Triassic (Induan) stromatolites and oolites of the Bernburg Formation revisited - microfacies and palaeoenvironment of lacustrine carbonates in Central Germany	FACIES												We propose a new facies classification scheme of the cyclic lacustrine carbonates of the Bernburg Formation (Lower Triassic, Induan), with a major focus on the microbial biota and grains. Our data are based on a detailed bed-by-bed outcrop study in Central Germany, within a robust (litho)stratigraphic framework. We concentrate on two intervals of the Bernburg Formation: one around the Calvorde/Bernburg Formation boundary (including the HRZ - Hauptrogensteinzone"), and a second around the ninth cycle near the upper formation boundary. The textural and mineralogical composition of the two endmember components: skeletal stromatolites and oolites, and the macro-, meso-, and microstructural characteristics (supplemented by mu-XRF-data) allow to classify the carbonates into five lithofacies types. They are interpreted with respect to the development of an ideal lacustrine depositional cycle, embedded between a lake level rise and a lake level fall. The microfacies attributes of the microbialites include various lamination types, shrubs, spherulites, and laminated/clotted/fenestral microfabrics. All sedimentologic (macro-, meso, and microscale) and geochemical data of this study indicate nearshore deposition of the carbonates at marginal shoals in a major endorheic lake (playa lake) with high alkalinity and salinity, and strongly fluctuating lake levels, under arid climates. The lacustrine carbonates are associated with maximum lake expansions, and are laterally interfingering with fan deltas, as indicated by abundant clastic grains in the intercalations of the skeletal stromatolites. The Bernburg Formation microbial buildups reflect changes in lake-level, hydrodynamics and grain supply, and therefore offer insights for the paleoenvironmental interpretation of lacustrine microbialites elsewhere.

Abundances of viruses and bacteria and bacterial metabolic activity were estimated using SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes), Baclight((TM)) (Molecular Probes) and 6-carboxy fluorescein diacetate (6CFDA). Total bacterial abundances among the lakes ranged between 0.12 and 0.47 x 10(9) cells L-1. The proportion of intact bacteria (SYTO (R) 9-stained cells) ranged from 13.5% to 83.5% of the total while active (6CFDA-stained) bacteria ranged from 33% to 116%. Lysogeny, as determined with Mitomycin C, was only detected in one of the lakes surveyed, indicating that viral replication was occurring predominately via the lytic cycle. Principal component analysis and confirmatory correlation analysis of individual variables showed that high abundances of VLP occurred in lakes of high conductivity with high concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon. These lakes supported high concentrations of chlorophyll a, intact bacteria, rates of bacterial production and virus to bacteria ratios. Thus, it was suggested that viral abundance in the Antarctic lakes was determined by the trophic status of the lake and the resultant abundance of intact bacterial hosts.

It started on the north-northeast wall of Dzhimarai-Khokh (4780ma.s.l.) and seriously affected the valley of Genaldon/Karmadon. Immediate governmental actions, available scientific information, first reconstructions, hazard assessments and monitoring activities as well as initial expert judgments/recommendations are documented in order to enable more detailed analyses and modelling of the event by the wider scientific community. Among the most remarkable aspects related to this event are (1) the relation between the recent event and somewhat smaller but quite similar events that occurred earlier in historical times (1835, 1902), (2) the interactions between unstable local geological structures and complex geothermal and hydraulic conditions in the starting zone with permafrost, cold to polythermal hanging glaciers and volcanic effects (hot springs) in close contact with each other, (3) the erosion and incorporation of a debris-covered valley glacier largely enhancing the sliding volume of rocks, ice, firn, snow, water and probably air to a total of about 100 X 10(6) m(3), and (4) the astonishingly high flow velocities (up to 300kmh(-1)) and enormous length of travel path (18km plus 15km of debris/mud-flow). This extraordinary case illustrates that large catastrophic events in high mountain regions typically involve a multitude of factors and require integrated consideration of complex chains of processes, a task which must be undertaken by qualified groups of experts.					; Osokin, Nikolay/J-2028-2014; Kääb, Andreas/AAG-8769-2020	Kaab, Andreas/0000-0002-6017-6564; Osokin, Nikolay/0000-0003-4217-321X; 													0022-1430						2004	50	171					533	546		10.3189/172756504781829710	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756504781829710													WOS:000231842100007

The Jilin Momoge National Nature Reserve, which consists of large areas of marshes, is located in the semi-arid region of northeast China and is an important stopover site for the critically endangered species of the Siberian Crane (Grus leucogeranus). Global climate change, extreme droughts and floods, and large differences in evaporation and precipitation in this region can cause rapid vegetation succession. In recent years, increased grain production and river-lake connectivity projects carried out in this area to increase grain outputs and restore wetlands have caused significant changes in the hydrological and landscape patterns. Therefore, research on the response of variation trends in vegetation patterns to the main driving factors (climate change and human activities) is critical for the conservation of the Siberian Crane. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we obtained and processed the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the study area during the peak summer vegetation period for each year from 1984 to 2020, estimated the annual vegetation cover using Maximum value composites (MVC) method and the image dichotomy method, calculated and analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of vegetation cover, explored the response of vegetation cover change in terms of climate change and human activities, and quantified the relative contribution of both. The results revealed that first, from the spatial and temporal changes, the average annual growth rate of regional vegetation was 0.002/a, and 71.14% of the study area was improved. The vegetation cover showed a trend of degradation and then recovery, in which the percentage of high vegetation cover area decreased from 51.22% (1984-2000) to 28.33% (2001-2005), and then recovered to 55.69% (2006-2020). Second, among climate change factors, precipitation was more correlated with the growth of vegetation in the study area than temperature, and the increase in precipitation during the growing season could promote the growth of marsh vegetation in the Momoge Reserve. Third, overall, human activities have contributed to the improvement of vegetation cover in the study area with the implementation of important ecological projects, such as the return of farmland to wetlands, the return of grazing to grass, and the connection of rivers and lakes. Fourth, climate change and human activities jointly drive vegetation change, but the contribution of human activities in both vegetation improvement and degradation areas (85.68% and 78.29%, respectively) is higher than that of climate change (14.32% and 21.71%, respectively), which is the main reason for vegetation improvement or degradation in the study area. The analysis of vegetation pattern change within an intensive time series in semi-arid regions can provide a reference and basis for studying the driving factors in regions with rapid changes in vegetation and hydrological conditions.																			1664-462X					SEP 27	2022	13								990592	10.3389/fpls.2022.990592	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.990592								36237507					WOS:000873759600001
J	PRISCU, JC; GOLDMAN, CR				PRISCU, JC; GOLDMAN, CR			THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON PHOTOSYNTHETIC AND RESPIRATORY ELECTRON-TRANSPORT SYSTEM ACTIVITY IN THE SHALLOW AND DEEP-LIVING PHYTOPLANKTON OF A SUBALPINE LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The influence of temperature on in vivo photosynthetic and in vitro respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity was determined over the season for the 3 m (warm-water) and a 20 m (cold-water) phytoplankton communities in Castle Lake. The optimum temperature of photosynthesis at 3 m (.hivin.X = 20.8.degree. C) was significantly higher than the average optimum at 20 m (.hivin.X = 14.8.degree. C). Seasonally, the photosynthetic temperature optimum increased when the blue-green alga Chroococcus limneticus Lemm. was present. The temperature characteristics of this organism were maintained even after it had settled into the cold water of he hypolimnion. Temperature optima were not significantly different in experiments conducted under limiting or saturating photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD). Short-term (1 h) preincubations with dissolved inorganic N (DIN) (.simeq. 80 .mu.g NH4NO3-N l-1) had little effect on the temperature characteristics of photosynthesis while the longer (> 24 h) incubations provided by a whole-lake epilimnetic DIN addition (.simeq. 75 .mu.g NH4NO3-N l-1) significantly lowered the photosynthetic temperature optimum to 12.5.degree. C. Once this epilimnetic DIN was depleted the optimum rose to 25.degree. C, a value higher than that present before the enrichment, which coincided with the growth of C. limneticus. Respiratory ETS activity usually began to inactivate between 19.degree. and 20.degree. C. When C. limneticus was abundant the inactivation temperature was often greater than 25.degree. C. The average energy of activation (E) and Q10 value for the 3 m community (15.9 kcal mol-1 and 2.6, respectively) were significantly higher than those at 20 m (14.2 kcal mol-1 and 2.4, respectively). Seasonally, the highest E and Q10 values of ETS activity occurred during the late-summer bloom of C. limneticus. The epilimnetic and hypolimnetic phytoplankton communities of Castle Lake are physiologically distinct in their temperature characteristics.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	2					143	155		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00028.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00028.x													WOS:A1984SH82500002

Non-classical crystallization of very high magnesium calcite and magnesite in the Coorong Lakes, Australia	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Coorong Lakes, South Australia, are one of the models for unravelling the 'Dolomite Problem'. Critically, today only a few modern environments remain where large quantities of very high magnesium calcite (VHMC; Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3; also described as protodolomite or disordered dolomite) and magnesite (MgCO3) precipitate. Previously conducted laboratory studies demonstrate that carbonate minerals can precipitate via classical and non-classical crystallization pathways. This study uses the preserved crystal sizes, morphologies and microstructures of Ca-Mg carbonates in the Coorong Lakes (Milne Lake, Pellet Lake and North Stromatolite Lake) to evaluate which crystallization pathway most likely occurred. In the fine-grained sediments of these lakes, very high magnesium calcite and magnesite occur as aggregate particles of nanocrystals (<100 nm). Rietveld refinements using X-ray diffraction data give modelled L-vol-IB crystallite size values of <120 nm for all carbonates. Transmission electron microscopy shows that, within VHMC and magnesite particles, nanocrystals have an almost identical orientation of their crystal lattice fringes. This is morphologically similar to Ca-Mg carbonates formed via an amorphous carbonate precursor in non-classical crystallization laboratory experiments. Precipitation of carbonate minerals via an amorphous-to-crystalline pathway requires the water to be supersaturated relative to both crystalline and amorphous phases. In the Coorong Lakes, surface water likely only becomes supersaturated relative to amorphous carbonate phases in the late summer after extensive evaporation. Observations suggest that VHMC and dolomite do not directly precipitate from bulk modern seawater, despite oversaturation relative to the crystalline phases, because seawater is undersaturated with respect to amorphous calcium magnesium carbonate, thus limiting the precipitation through a non-classical crystallization pathway.

It combines studies (i) of sediment sequences observed on the northern shore and (ii) of sediment cores from littoral mires and plateform on (or close to) archaeological sites of the western shore. On a multimillennial scale, the results give evidence of three major phases characterized by a general trend to lowering until ca 9000 cal BP, a lowest lake-level until ca 7000 cal BP and a general trend to rise until the present. It also gives evidence of multicentennial fluctuations superimposed on the plurimillennial phases. Taken together, the Lake Annecy record shows a pattern of lake-level changes similar to the regional one reconstructed for west-central Europe. In agreement with other Alpine and extra-regional palaeoclimatic records, it supports the hypothesis of different climate forcing factors with (i) a dominating impact of orbitally driven summer insolation, (ii) an influence of deglacial outbursts in the North Atlantic Ocean, and (iii) a possible impact of variations in solar activity.					brigand, robin/G-4650-2014	Hinschberger, florent/0000-0002-8584-9059													1142-2904					SEP	2022	33	3					169	192																WOS:000945728400002

These lakes represented the following four lake aquaculture management strategies: fish ranching in lakes classified as receiving low (LOW; used for backup drinking water and irrigation), medium (MEDIUM), or high (HIGH; fish fed commercial feed) stocking rates or as fallow (FALLOW), in which previously ranched HIGH lakes had not been stocked for 2years. Results showed a positive relationship between most heavy metal concentrations and fish culture intensity. Concentrations of Cu, Zn, and aluminum (Al) in the water column were significantly greater in the HIGH lakes than in the LOW lakes. Heavy metals in the FALLOW lakes did not appear to fully recover from past aquaculture activities. In sediment, the concentration of As in LOW lakes was significantly lower than those in MEDIUM and HIGH lakes, whereas no among-group significant differences in the other heavy metal concentrations were detected. Metals in sediments of all four lake types were at the low ecological risk level. We speculate that these results may be applied to lakes in other regions globally with similar fish stocking and management strategies.

This is caused primarily by the dramatic difference between the lake surface temperature and the temperature of surrounding land that is observed almost always, except when both lake and land are covered by snow. There are also sharp discontinuities at the water bodies' boundaries of other thermodynamic, radiation and aerodynamic surface characteristics, such as roughness height and albedo. This, in turn, causes significant spatial heterogeneity of surface turbulent and radiation fluxes in regions densely occupied by lakes and other water bodies. A onedimensional lake model has been used to simulate the thermal water temperature variables, over a 35-yr period. This model is highly parameterized and is designed for long-term calculations of lake thermodynamics at low computational costs and with minimum adjustment. An epilimnion and metalimnion temperatures variables are presented. The result analysis shows that epilimnion temperatures increased, while metalimnion temperatures decreased. On the other hand, an abrupt change in epilimnion temperature after 1998 and 2006 in Lake Sidi Ali; and after 1989, and 1982 for Sidi Boughaba Lake, caused by climate change. The predictive model can be used to obtain a first-order estimation of water temperature in Moroccan's Lakes, affected by climate change.					; azidane, hind/ABG-5493-2020	karra, rachid/0000-0002-0422-4138; Azidane, Hind/0000-0002-5627-783X; 													1571-5124	1814-2060				JUL 2	2020	18	3					321	333		10.1080/15715124.2018.1498854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2018.1498854													WOS:000561243700001

Later, twenty of these lakes were selected for further monitoring. A sampling of these lakes from 1988-1989 showed that the decrease in some perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) populations still continued. The results from the same lakes in 1992 showed that successful reproduction had taken place with many of the perch populations that had been close to extinction in 1985. in contrast, no signs of recovery in the roach populations were detected The explanation for the appearance of new cohorts of perch could have been the decrease in acid deposition but the exceptional hydrological conditions of winters in the early 1990s may also have affected them The different responses of the perch and roach populations were interpreted as a consequence of the different sensitivity of these two species to acidification. Even a slight improvement in the water quality has resulted in the appearance of strong new year-classes of perch, but not of roach. Therefore, more improvement in water quality is needed until a sensitive species like roach can reproduce again.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					315	320		10.1007/BF00476848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476848													WOS:A1995UB05300006

Reduced snow and increased nutrients show enhanced ice-associated photoautotrophic growth using a modified experimental under-ice design	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Under-ice photoautotrophs in lakes are generally considered to be limited by light rather than nutrients. Despite reduced light intensity under the ice, there is increasing evidence that suggests some lakes support high levels of photoautotrophs. We explored how snow cover (i.e., light) and nutrients (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) influence ice-associated photoautotroph growth in a Minnesota, USA lake. Using a novel under-ice approach, we deployed nutrient diffusing substrates (single or combined nutrient amendments) under two different light scenarios (snow covered, reduced light; snow removed, increased light) near the water-ice interface to mimic a range of conditions ice-associated photoautotrophs may be exposed to. Natural snow cover reduced light compared with snow removal, particularly early in the experiment before snow began to melt. When comparing photoautotroph chlorophyll a (Chl a) between snow treatments, we found a significant snow effect with higher concentrations in the snow removed treatment. We also found a significant nutrient effect, for all nutrient treatments, on Chl a concentrations in both snow conditions. The effect of any nutrient treatment on Chl a concentrations was similar. Our results suggest that ice-associated photoautotrophs were able to grow in all snow conditions, but snow removal resulted in higher growth and nutrient availability also mediated responses. Thus, both light and nutrient conditions in the winter may strongly affect ice-associated photoautotroph dynamics.

J	Persson, G; Appelberg, M				Persson, G; Appelberg, M			Evidence of lower productivity in long term limed lakes as compared to unlimed lakes of similar pH	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					6th International Conference on Acidic Deposition	DEC 10-16, 2000	TSUKUBA, JAPAN					Ecosystem development in lime-treated waters in Sweden has been followed since 1989 in a programme for integrated studies of the effects of liming acidified waters (ISELAW). Observations after prolonged liming (> 10 y) indicate a phosphorus depletion in the limed lakes which contrasts to the increased phosphorus supply often following within the initial years after lime treatment. After prolonged liming, the levels of total phosphorus are lower as compared to neutral reference lakes at identical TOC, and the phosphorus/TOC-ratio is consequently lower in limed lakes. Depletion of dissolved inorganic nitrogen during the summer is also lower in limed as compared to neutral reference lakes. Phytoplankton biomass and species number also lower in the limed lakes as compared to unlimed neutral references. Furthermore the bacterial number per unit TOC is lower in the long term limed lakes, possibly as a result of phosphorus limitation. As to the higher trophic levels, the benthic soft-bottom fauna of limed lakes (specifically the sublittoral fauna) is poorer in terms of species diversity and abundance. Also fish community composition indicates lower productivity in the limed lakes. Taken together there is thus evidence that the long term limed lakes have a lower trophic level than reference lakes.																			0049-6979					AUG-SEP	2001	130	1-4	3				1769	1774		10.1023/A:1013980607595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013980607595													WOS:000172012000143

Ground-level concentrations of atmospheric methane in southwest Greenland evaluated using open-path laser spectroscopy and cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Portable open-path laser (OPL) instruments provide a way to measure real-time, in situ atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Our results suggest that OPL instruments may be simple and effective tools for monitoring atmospheric CH4 dynamics near ground-level in Arctic landscapes. We used a CH4 detecting OPL instrument at seven different field sites in southwest Greenland during the summer of 2012 to monitor atmospheric CH4 concentrations in the presence of local CH4 sources and sinks. Measurements with the OPL were conducted for deployments between 0.4 and 40 h over path lengths between 10 and 300 m. These measurements were checked against periodic grab samples analyzed in the field lab using cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy. Mean concentrations of atmospheric CH4 measured with the OPL across all field sites ranged from 1.72 (+/- 0.12) to 1.88 (+/- 0.15) ppm by volume (ppmv). The median atmospheric CH4 concentration measured using cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy was 1.82 +/- 0.04 ppmv. Slightly elevated CH4 concentrations were measured downwind of one lake and in a subglacial cave. OPL measurements of atmospheric CH4 concentrations agreed with results from cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (<3% difference). OPL technology may be a useful tool for extended CH4 monitoring studies in the Arctic and may help in our understanding of atmospheric CH4 concentrations at spatial and temporal scales not accessible to other forms of measurement.

A sedimentary record of the rise and fall of the metal industry in Bergslagen, south central Sweden	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Detailed stratigraphic analyses of sediments deposited in Lake Botjarnen, a small boreal forest lake in the shield terrain of central Sweden, clearly reflect progressively increasing human impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following settlement and establishment of an iron industry in the 17th century. Rising frequencies of pollen and spores from light-demanding plants provide evidence of extensive forest clearance for charcoal and timber production, which peaked in the early 20th century. An associated increase in catchment erosion is reflected by changing carbon and nitrogen elemental content and carbon-isotope composition of sediment organic matter and by increased magnetic susceptibility of the sediments. Records of air-borne pollutants (lead, zinc and sulphur) can be correlated to the development of local and regional mining and metal industry as inferred from historical accounts. Rapid recession of the iron industry led to re-forestation and recovery of the aquatic nutrient status to pre-industrial conditions over the past 100 years. The chronology of the sediment succession, which is based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 radionuclide data in combination with radiocarbon dating, is confirmed by historical lead pollution trends established for the region.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008	Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334; Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAY	2008	39	4					463	475		10.1007/s10933-007-9124-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9124-z													WOS:000254905100003

Phytoplankton is modelled with a non-linear dynamic model which describes the succession of three dominant algae groups (Diatomophyceae, Chrysophyceae, nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria) and minor groups summed together as a function of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, temperature, global irradiance and crustacean zooplankton grazing. The model is fitted using 8 years of in situ observations and adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for estimation of model parameters. The approach offers a way to deal with noisy data and a large number of weakly identifiable parameters in a model. From our posterior simulations we calculate the lower limit for zooplankton carbon mass concentration (45 mu gC L-1) and the upper limit for total phosphorus concentration (16 mu g L-1) that satisfy with 0.95 probability our predefined water quality criteria (Cyanobacteria concentration during late summer period does not exceed the value 0.86 mg L-1). Within the observational range total phosphorus has marginal effect on Cyanobacteria compared to the zooplankton grazing effect, which is temperature-dependent. Extensive fishing efforts are needed to attain the criteria. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spawning behaviour of lake whitefish in Lake Huron revealed by fine-scale acoustic telemetry and Indigenous ecological knowledge	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant across their range, yet little is documented about the species' spawning behaviour. Here, we used a VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) and the local ecological knowledge of Saugeen Ojibway Nation in a Two-Eyed Seeing approach to characterize sex-specific movement patterns of lake whitefish at a spawning shoal in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron (Ontario, Canada). In fall 2020, 50 lake whitefish were tagged with acoustic transmitters and 28 of those fish were detected during the deployment of the VPS between 15 October 2021 and 18 January 2022. Occupancy of lake whitefish on the VPS followed a bell-shaped pattern, with an increase, plateau that lasted similar to 1 week, and subsequent decrease in activity over a 48-day period demarcating the 2021 spawning season. Apart from 2 resident females, males appeared in the area first. Both sexes moved into shallower lake depths at night and deeper depths during the day. Females moved 18.0% faster than males during the day whereas males moved 39.5% faster than females at night. Depths occupied became shallower over time until the peak activity phase, followed by a transition back to deeper waters. Both sexes used a variety of habitats over the spawning season, including the main spawning shoal, sandy substrates, and steep slopes. These insights on the habitat usage and spawning phenology of lake whitefish provided through our Two-Eyed Seeing approach can help inform stewardship initiatives aimed at increasing recruitment of depleted populations of this important species. In our study of the spawning behaviour of lake whitefish, we observed fish using a variety of habitat types during the spawning season, including a rocky spawning shoal, sandy substrates, and steeper slopes. Both sexes moved shallower at night and deeper during the day, with males moving more at night and females more during the day. This study could help inform stewardship efforts aimed at lake whitefish spawning habitat restoration and protection.					; Dunlop, Erin/HGA-8508-2022	Buell, Mary-Claire/0000-0003-0352-5454; Dunlop, Erin/0000-0002-5289-2851; 														2823-1465				JUL 4	2024	60								8	10.1051/limn/2024007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2024007													WOS:001261937300001

Development of the Holocene foredune plain in the Narva-Joesuu area, eastern Gulf of Finland	GEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY												The morphogenesis and inner structure of the Holocene foredune plain in the Narva-Joesuu area, eastern Gulf of Finland, were studied using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) study and interpretation of airborne LIDAR elevation data. The results show that the Narva-Joesuu foredune plain consists of ca. 100 parallel coastal foredune ridges built of well-sorted fine sand underlain by gently (similar to 7 degrees) seaward-dipping sandy beach deposits. The distal part of the plain, which consists of at least 15 ridges, formed during the regressive phase of the Ancylus Lake/Early Litorina Sea, serving as a barrier for the lagoon behind it. A larger portion of ridges, with an average progradation rate of 0.26 m a(-1), formed under conditions of falling relative sea level during the Litorina regression and was separated from the older foredune succession by a hiatus related to the Litorina transgression at 8.5-7.3 cal. ka BP. In the highest central part of the plain the foredune growth was interrupted by foredune instability and a re-blowing episode dated to 5.4 +/- 0.9 ka BP which may correlate with a larger regional cooling at 5.8-5.1 cal. ka BP in the North Atlantic and central Europe. During the last 3000 years, the foredune progradation rate decreased to 0.19 m a(-1), most probably because of decelerated land-uplift and increased human impact due to coastal protection.					; Plado, Juri/Y-2405-2018; Plado, Jüri/Y-2405-2018; Jõeleht, Argo/AAJ-1246-2020; Rosentau, Alar/H-9919-2018; Muru, Merle/N-6074-2019	Rosentau, Alar/0000-0002-7484-5853; Plado, Juri/0000-0001-7473-6043; Muru, Merle/0000-0002-4422-2639; 													1641-7291						2013	57	1					89	100		10.7306/gq.1077	http://dx.doi.org/10.7306/gq.1077													WOS:000317794400007
J	Lovvorn, JR; Gillingham, MP				Lovvorn, JR; Gillingham, MP			Food dispersion and foraging energetics: A mechanistic synthesis for field studies of avian benthivores	ECOLOGY												Much effort has focused on modeling and measuring the energy costs of free existence and the foraging strategies of animals. However, few studies have quantitatively linked these approaches to the patch structure of foods in the field. We developed an individual-based model that relates field measurements of the dispersion of benthic foods to search costs and foraging profitability of diving ducks. On Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, Canvasback ducks (Aythya valisineria) eat only the belowground winter buds of the submerged plant Vallisneria americana. We measured and modeled the patch structure of winter buds at the level of potential foraging ''loci,'' defined as contiguous circles 1 m in diameter. In the field and in the model, Canvasbacks make repeated vertical dives in such loci, foraging in the sediments by touch, before surface-swimming to another locus. We quantified first-order patchiness by fitting a negative bi nomial distribution to core samples taken at 50-m intervals along transects, to yield the frequencies of loci with different bud densities. Second-order patchiness was measured by taking cores at 1-m increments radiating from each sampling point, and regressing bud density at each sampling point on densities at these increments. No significant correlations were found, indicating that Canvasbacks could not predict food densities based on densities in nearby foraging loci. For the model, we generated food grids from the negative binomial distributions of core samples. Energy costs of diving were calculated by applying aerobic efficiencies (mechanical power output divided by aerobic power input) to biomechanical models. Unlike respirometry alone, this method accounts for effects on dive costs of varying water depth and dive duration. We used measurements of Canvasback intake rates at different bud densities to calculate profitability (energy intake minus expenditure) for each dive. Multivariate uncertainty analyses (Latin hypercube) indicated that profitability for Canvasbacks foraging on Vallisneria buds is determined mainly by food-item size and locomotor costs of descent. Bud metabolizable energy, water temperature, bud dispersion, and search and handling time coefficients of the functional response for intake rate have relatively minor influence. Individual-parameter perturbations indicated that to maintain the same foraging benefits, the total area of Vallisneria habitat would have to increase by 1.4-fold if dry mass per bud decreased from 0.10 to 0.03 g, and by 2.1-fold if water depth increased from 0.5 to 2 m. Our method allows study of interactions between patch structure and foraging energetics without detailed spatial mapping of foods, which is not feasible at appropriate scales for highly mobile benthivores. The model yields estimates of energy balance, contaminant intake, and amount and quality of foraging habitat required to sustain diving duck populations under varying environmental conditions. More accurate prediction of giving-up times and giving-up food densities will require better understanding of the time scale over which ducks balance their energy budgets.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	1996	77	2					435	451		10.2307/2265620	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2265620													WOS:A1996TY19800008

The mean K'(4) for SRFA (K' with thiol pK(a) = 4 2) was 10(9 8) (range 10(9 11)-10(10 27)) and small slope (0.02) Similar values were found for Spring Lake NOM, bog S2 NOM had values one-tenth as large.

Phosphorus removal from agricultural tile drainage effluent with activated alumina in novel adsorption reactors	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Subsurface tile drains under agricultural field crops are a major source of phosphorus (P) discharge to aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the eutrophication of surface waters. Adsorption reactors for P removal from drainage water (P-reactors) could reduce P outflow from agricultural land but were rarely studied in cold, temperate climates. In our study, four low-cost P-reactors were installed in agricultural fields in south-central Quebec, Canada. Activated alumina (AA) beads were used as P-adsorptive material, and the reactors were connected to tile drain outlets. Paired water samples (39 events) from reactor inlets and outlets were analyzed for P species and other physicochemical parameters during one calendar year to assess the P removal from tile drain effluent in the P-reactors. Collectively, the P-reactors retained approximately half (48%) of the total mass of P flowing through the tile drains, mostly (92%) as particulate P. The mass of AA beads adsorbed 11% of the dissolved-P fractions. Results are interpreted in the context of the field drainage area and will require adjustments to the P-reactor design to accommodate larger fields. The P-reactors remained structurally intact throughout all four seasons in a cold temperate climate, showing the potential of simple, inexpensive P-reactors to reduce P concentration in tile drain effluent. Agricultural tile drainage phosphorus (P)-adsorption reactors were tested for one calendar year in Canada.The P-reactors retained 48% of the cumulative P mass from tile drains, mostly as particulate P.The activated alumina media captured 11% of the dissolved P mass.The P-reactors were simple, inexpensive, and functioned in cold temperate field conditions.Choice of P adsorbent materials may increase the retention of dissolved P. Water draining from agricultural fields contains phosphorus in dissolved and suspended forms. As we need to minimize the phosphorus transported from agricultural fields to rivers and lakes, the authors designed a filter system to retain the phosphorus at the end of the field. These filters, called phosphorus adsorption reactors, removed almost half of the phosphorus from water leaving the drainage pipe. Suspended phosphorus was more efficiently retained than dissolved phosphorus within the filter system. Design modifications are proposed to increase the efficiency of the filter. It was simple and inexpensive to build the filter, which functioned year-round, even in the winter when the field was covered by a thick layer of snow. We recommend installing filters at the end of the field to reduce the phosphorus losses in agricultural drainage water.					; Whalen, Joann/F-7419-2013	Whalen, Joann/0000-0001-8774-0594; Husk, Barry/0000-0002-5993-1024; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR	2024	53	2					220	231		10.1002/jeq2.20540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20540		JAN 2024						38243780					WOS:001145475400001

Celestine occurs within a gypsum/anhydrite-halite evaporite sequence where it replaces gypsum and gypsified stromatolites preserving carbonate peloids. Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta S-34 values in the Montevive celestine deposit are close to those reported for the saline unit (Chimeneas Halite; marine to nonmarine) but higher than those of the overlying gypsum unit (Agron Gypsum; nonmarine). Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta S-34 isotope values in the Escuzar celestine deposit match the nonmarine values recorded in the upper part of the Agron Gypsum. The similarity in isotope values between celestine and the corresponding gypsum host in the Escuzar deposit points to early-diagenetic mineralization. According to that, both orebodies are diachronous. Gypsum pseudomorphs and molds, intraformational breccias and karst structures in these celestine deposits point to dissolved gypsum as the main sulfate source. Diagenetic-hydrothermal CaCl2 brines are interpreted to be the main strontium source. The spatial relationship between gypsified stromatolites and the ore deposits suggests the existence of coeval thermal springs related to fractures, bordering the saline lake. The proposed model envisages gypsum dissolution by SO-poor and Sr2+-rich, CaCl2 diagenetic-hydrothermal water discharging in coastal ponds at times of dry periods and low meteoric water inflow. The increase in SO42- concentration by gypsum dissolution and the low solubility of SrSO4 would lead to celestine precipitation replacing gypsum and gypsified stromatolites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Sulfide oxidation in anoxic waters can prevent the efflux of sulfide to aerobic water masses, thus mitigating toxicity. The contribution of phototrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria to anaerobic sulfide oxidation in the Chesapeake Bay and the redox chemistry of the stratified water column were investigated in the summers of 2011 to 2014. In 2011 and 2013, phototrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria closely related to Prosthecochloris species of the phylum Chlorobi were cultivated from waters sampled at and below the oxic-anoxic interface, where measured light penetration was sufficient to support populations of low-light-adapted photosynthetic bacteria. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, light-dependent sulfide loss was observed in freshly collected water column samples. In these samples, extremely low light levels caused 2- to 10-fold increases in the sulfide uptake rate over the sulfide uptake rate under dark conditions. An enrichment, CB11, dominated by Prosthecochloris species, oxidized sulfide with a K-s value of 11 mu M and a V-max value of 51 mu M min(-1) (mg protein(-1)). Using these kinetic values with in situ sulfide concentrations and light fluxes, we calculated that a small population of Chlorobi similar to those in enrichment CB11 can account for the observed anaerobic light-dependent sulfide consumption activity in natural water samples. We conclude that Chlorobi play a far larger role in the Chesapeake Bay than currently appreciated. This result has potential implications for coastal anoxic waters and expanding oxygen-minimum zones as they begin to impinge on the photic zone.

N. laevigata is a long lived polytelic species reproducing once a year in late spring. Recruitment was underestimated due both to the mesh size used for sampling and to the settlement of the polychaete into filamentous algae covering the sediment, which was never quantitatively examined. The analysis of population structure revealed similar trends in 1989 and 1990, when the population was dominated by adult forms, while the year 1991 was characterized by a general decrease in individual size. This was shown also by the analysis of the secondary production which ranged from 3:3 to 1.8 g AFDW/m(2)/yr. This was probably due to changes in the relative abundance of different year classes which in turn could be attributed to some physical and biotic modifications occurring during the period of study. In this period, some changes in the relative dominance within the polychaete assemblage occurred and competition between Naineris laevigata and the ecologically similar species Notomastus latericeus can be hypothesised.

J	ROSSARO, B				ROSSARO, B			FACTORS THAT DETERMINE CHIRONOMIDAE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION IN FRESH WATERS	BOLLETTINO DI ZOOLOGIA												About one thousand samples of chironomids collected in Italy from running water, spring and lakes have been analyzed by detrended correspondence analysis. A single factor accounted for a wide scattering of data and allowed sites and species to be ordered according to a gradient easily identifiable on the basis of water temperature. On the first axis, glacier streams rich in species belonging to the tribe Diamesini were at one end, lowland rivers rich in species belonging to the tribe Chironomini were at the other. The second axis ranged from fast flowing water to standing water, with species (Eurothocladius spp.) preferring the former opposed to those (Heterotrissocladius sp., Macropelopia spp.) preferring the latter. The third axis can be interpreted as a substratum gradient, but this needs to be supported by more evidence. The other axes produced by the analysis had no apparent ecological meaning. The ordering of species along a few gradients can be used as a baseline against which the effect of other factors can be analyzed in future research. Species responses to river regulation, and organic and toxic pollution are often monitored biologically; however the effects of these factors can be successfully understood only when the effects of natural gradients are well known.

Significant changes in midge community composition occurred during the last 2000 years, with a distinct midge community appearing after 1600 AD. The chironomid community between 0 and 1600 AD was dominated by Heterotrissocladius, Tanytarsus, Abiskomyia, and Paracladius. At approximately 1600 AD, Heterotrissocladius decreased in relative abundance and taxa such as Corynocera ambigua, C. oliveri, Psectrocladius sordidellus type, and Pentanneurini increased in relative abundance. Previously published midge-based inference models for average July air temperature (AJAT) and summer surface-water temperature (SSWT) were applied to the subfossil midge stratigraphy. The AJAT reconstruction indicates relatively cool conditions existed between 1100 and 1600 AD, with exceptional warming occuring after 1600 AD, as lake productivity inferred from organic-matter content increased concomitantly with midge-inferred AJAT and SSWT. The cooler conditions between 1200 and 1600 AD, and the pattern of warming over recent centuries inferred from Lake V57 is broadly consistent with temperature-sensitive biogenic silica records from other sites in the central Canadian Arctic and the treeline zone to the south suggesting a regionally synchronous response to climate forcing.					; Porinchu, DF/S-4360-2019	Rolland, Nicolas/0000-0001-9883-8124; Porinchu, David/0000-0002-0495-3082; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2009	41	1					177	188		10.1007/s10933-008-9263-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9263-x													WOS:000262505400012

Molecular phylogeny, biogeography, and systematics of Dicerandra (Lamiaceae), a genus endemic to the southeastern United States'	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Dicerandra, an endemic mint of the southeastern United States, comprises nine species, all of which are threatened or endangered and restricted to sandhill vegetation and a mosaic of scrub habitats. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Dicerandra based on data from the nuclear and plastid genomes for all 13 taxa of the genus, identified two strongly supported clades, corresponding to the four annual and to the five perennial species of Dicerandra. However, the nuclear and plastid trees were incongruent in their placement of two perennial taxa, D. cornutissima and D. immaculata var. savannarum, perhaps due to ancient hybridization or to lineage sorting. Based on these analyses, the widespread D. linearifolia is not monophyletic, with populations of D. linearifolia var. linearifolia falling into either western or eastern clades. The western clade, comprising populations of D. linearifolia var. linearifolia and var. robustior, occurs in an area drained by rivers flowing toward the Gulf of Mexico, whereas the eastern clade, comprising populations of D. linearifolia var. linearifolia, D. densiflora, D. odoratissima, and D. radfordiana (i.e., all the annual species), occupies a region drained by rivers flowing to the Atlantic Ocean. Although this pattern of genetic differentiation between populations from these two river drainages has been documented in several animal species, it has not previously been reported for plants. A revised subgeneric classification is presented to reflect the annual and perennial clades.					; Oliveira, Luiz/D-6435-2013; Soltis, Pamela/L-5184-2015; Soltis, Douglas/L-5957-2015	Gitzendanner, Matthew/0000-0002-7078-4336; Oliveira, Luiz/0000-0002-5578-2260; Soltis, Pamela/0000-0001-9310-8659; 													0002-9122	1537-2197				JUN	2007	94	6					1017	1027		10.3732/ajb.94.6.1017	http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.94.6.1017								21636471					WOS:000249830600013

Groundwater and surface water quality characterization through positive matrix factorization combined with GIS approach	WATER RESEARCH												This study aims at testing the effectiveness of Positive Matrix Factorization in characterizing ground-water and surface water quality, in terms of identifying main hydrochemical features and processes (natural and anthropogenic) that govern them. This method is applied in a hydro-system featured by a strong interrelation between groundwater and surface water and highly impacted by agricultural activities. Therefore, a holistic approach considering groundwater together with the surface water bodies, consisting in lake, several rivers and springs, was used. Multivariate statistical analysis, in particular Factor Analysis, has been proved to be effective in elaborating and interpreting water quality data highlighting the information carried within them, but it presents some limitations: it does not consider data uncertainty and it groups variables which are correlated positively and negatively. Moreover, in some cases the resulting factors are not clearly interpretable, describing each one various overlapping features/processes. Here, Positive Matrix Factorization is applied to groundwater and surface water quality data, and the results are compared to those obtained through a Factor Analysis in terms of both factor profiles and their spatial distribution through a GIS approach. Results of isotopes analysis are used to validate PMF output and support interpretation. Positive Matrix Factorization allows to consider data uncertainty and the solution respects two positivity constraints, based on the concept of chemical mass balance, which leads to a more environmentally interpretable solution. Results show that Positive Matrix Factorization identifies five different factors reflecting main features and natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the study area: 1) surface water used for irrigation, 2) groundwater subjected to reducing processes at advanced stages, 3) groundwater subjected to reducing processes at early stages, 4) groundwater residence time and 5) the effects of the agricultural land use on both groundwater and surface water. Positive Matrix Factorization leads to a more detailed understanding of the studied system as compared to Factor Analysis which identifies only three factors with overlapping information. Based on the results of this study, Positive Matrix Factorization could be a useful technique to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization and to reach a deeper understanding of the phenomena that govern water chemistry.

J	Anneville, O; Souissi, S; Gammeter, S; Straile, D				Anneville, O; Souissi, S; Gammeter, S; Straile, D			Seasonal and inter-annual scales of variability in phytoplankton assemblages: comparison of phytoplankton dynamics in three peri-alpine lakes over a period of 28 years	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A method based on hierarchical clustering and Bayesian probabilities is used to identify phytoplankton assemblages and analyse their pattern of occurrence and temporal coherence in three deep, peri-alpine lakes. The hierarchical properties of the method allowed ranking by order of importance of the effects of changes related to climate and to human activity on the phytoplankton structure. 2. The three deep, peri-alpine lakes (the Lower Zurich, Upper Zurich and Walen lakes) investigated in this study have been monitored since 1972. During that period they have undergone oligotrophication as a result of management programmes and they have been subject to similar meteorological effects that have led to higher water temperatures since 1988. 3. The phytoplankton assemblages of the most eutrophic lake (Lower Zurich) differ strongly from those observed in the two meso-oligotrophic lakes. Local environmental conditions appear to be the main factor responsible for species composition and change in climate characterised by the warmer water temperatures observed since 1988 have had a major impact on the winter composition of the lower basin of Lake Zurich by promoting Planktothrix rubescens. 4. Some phytoplankton assemblages are found in all the lakes. Their patterns of occurrence display strong synchrony at the annual and/or inter-annual scales. However, temporal coherence between the lakes sometimes also involves different assemblages. 5. The reduction in phosphorus had a great influence on long-term changes in composition. In all three lakes, decreases in phosphorus are associated with a community characterised by some mixotrophic species or species adapted to low nutrient concentrations or sensitive to transparency. In the Lower Lake Zurich the decrease in phosphorus has also led to the development of species adapted to low light intensities. 6. Seasonal meteorological forcing has also induced synchronous changes, but the same assemblages are not necessarily involved, because the pool of the well-placed candidate taxa that may develop is determined by the local environmental conditions, and mainly by phosphorus concentrations. In the most eutrophic lake, the seasonal pattern is characterised by a succession of more stages. However, the seasonal assembly dynamics involve the succession of species sharing common selective advantages that make them relatively stronger under these nutrient and light conditions.					; Souissi, Sami/C-5146-2018; Straile, Dietmar/A-4065-2008	Souissi, Sami/0000-0002-6720-0096; Straile, Dietmar/0000-0002-7441-8552													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2004	49	1					98	115		10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01167.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01167.x													WOS:000187405500009

Its major outputs include base saturation, pH, and the molar Al/Ca ratio for soils, and major cations and anions for soil and lake water. The model structure is based on the anion mobility concept and the charge balance principle. SMART was applied to the Christmas Lakes, a chain of small oligotrophic catchments in northeast subarctic Finnish Lapland (69 degrees 25'N, 29 degrees 11'E), located close to the border with Norway and 40 km from the Nikel smelter in Russia, a major source of sulfur emissions. The Christmas Lakes are less than 60 ha in size, have clear water, and are low in base cations and alkalinity. At present, the lakes are not very acidic, the pH being around 6.5 in autumn. The SMART model was calibrated to present soil and water quality data, using best estimates for historical deposition patterns for the period 1890-1990. The model applications in this paper are intended to demonstrate the range of potential catchment responses in northern Lapland for different assumptions concerning sulfur. The two calibrations of the model, assuming (1) a high sulfur deposition in combination with sulfate adsorption and (2) a lower present deposition with no adsorption, revealed that the present sulfur deposition has to lie between 0.4 and 0.8 g S/m(2)/year. The model results for both calibrations indicate that future sulfur deposition would have to be very low to stop and reverse the ongoing acidification. However, since the present base saturation is fairly high (> 50%), there is still time (several years) to reduce the sulfur deposition to values the system can tolerate.																			0048-9697					JAN 15	1995	160-61						687	701		10.1016/0048-9697(95)04403-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)04403-N													WOS:A1995QD14300066

While a portion of the Cl- applied as road salt is quickly flushed into streams during melt events via overland flow and flow through storm sewer pipes, the remainder enters the subsurface. Previous studies of individual watersheds have shown that between 28 and 77% of the applied Cl- is retained on an annual basis, however a systematic evaluation of the spatial variability in Cl- retention and potential driving factors has not been carried out. Here we used a mass balance approach to estimate annual Cl- retention in 11 watersheds located in southern Ontario, Canada, which span a gradient of urbanization. We evaluated the influence of multiple landscape variables on the magnitude of Cl- retention as well as the long-term rate of change in stream Cl- concentration for the same systems. We found that mean annual Cl- retention ranged from 40 to 90% and was higher for less urbanized watersheds and for water-sheds with urban areas located farther from the stream outlet. This result suggests that less urbanized watersheds and ones with longer flow pathways have more Cl- partitioned into storage and hence the potential for legacy Cl- effects on aquatic organisms. While we did measure statistically significant increasing trends in stream Cl- concentration in some watersheds, there was no consistent relationship between the long-term rate of change in stream Cl- concentrations and patterns of urbanization and the magnitude of Cl- retention. Based on our results we present a detailed conceptual model of watershed Cl- dynamics that can be used to guide future research into the mechanisms of Cl- retention and release within a watershed.

A DNA-Based Assessment of the Phylogenetic Position of a Morphologically Distinct, Anchialine-Lake-Restricted Seahorse	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY												Isolated populations provide special opportunities to study local adaptation and incipient speciation. In some cases, however, morphological evolution can obscure the taxonomic status of recently founded populations. Here, we use molecular markers to show that an anchialine-lake-restricted population of seahorses, originally identified as Hippocampus reidi, appears on the basis of DNA data to be Hippocampus erectus. We collected seahorses from Sweetings Pond, on Eleuthera Island, Bahamas, during the summer of 2014. We measured morphological traits and sequenced 2 genes, cytochrome b and ribosomal protein S7, from 19 seahorses in our sample. On the basis of morphology, Sweetings Pond seahorses could not be assigned definitively to either of the 2 species of seahorse, H. reidi and H. erectus, that occur in marine waters surrounding the Bahamas. However, our DNA-based phylogenetic analysis showed that the Sweetings Pond fish were firmly nested within the H. erectus clade with a Bayesian posterior probability greater than 0.99. Thus, Sweetings Pond seahorses most recently shared a common ancestor with H. erectus populations from the Western Atlantic. Interestingly, the seahorses from Sweetings Pond differ morphologically from other marine populations of H. erectus in having a more even torso to tail length ratio. The substantial habitat differences between Sweetings Pond and the surrounding coastal habitat make Sweetings Pond seahorses particularly interesting from the perspectives of conservation, local adaptation, and incipient speciation.

Fe(III), Cr(VI), and Fe(III) mediated Cr(VI) reduction in alkaline media using a Halomonas isolate from Soap Lake, Washington	BIODEGRADATION												Hexavalent chromium is one of the most widely distributed environmental contaminants. Given the carcinogenic and mutagenic consequences of Cr(VI) exposure, the release of Cr(VI) into the environment has long been a major concern. While many reports of microbial Cr(VI) reduction are in circulation, very few have demonstrated Cr(VI) reduction under alkaline conditions. Since Cr(VI) exhibits higher mobility in alkaline soils relative to pH neutral soils, and since Cr contamination of alkaline soils is associated with a number of industrial activities, microbial Cr(VI) reduction under alkaline conditions requires attention. Soda lakes are the most stable alkaline environments on earth, and contain a wide diversity of alkaliphilic organisms. In this study, a bacterial isolate belonging to the Halomonas genus was obtained from Soap Lake, a chemically stratified alkaline lake located in central Washington State. The ability of this isolate to reduce Cr(VI) and Fe(III) was assessed under alkaline (pH = 9), anoxic, non-growth conditions with acetate as an electron donor. Metal reduction rates were quantified using Monod kinetics. In addition, Cr(VI) reduction experiments were carried out in the presence of Fe(III) to evaluate the possible enhancement of Cr(VI) reduction rates through electron shuttling mechanisms. While Fe(III) reduction rates were slow compared to previously reported rates, Cr(VI) reduction rates fell within range of previously reported rates.					; Peyton, Brent/AAC-4210-2019; Peyton, Brent/G-5247-2015	Mormile, Melanie/0000-0001-9054-2687; Peyton, Brent/0000-0003-0033-0651													0923-9820	1572-9729				NOV	2008	19	6					841	850		10.1007/s10532-008-9187-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-008-9187-1								18401687					WOS:000259412100007

Moreover, reassessing the effect of climate change on SOC variability is necessary, with the increasing variability of El Nino under greenhouse warming. Here, we present new insights from bacterial 3-hydroxy fatty acids (3-OH-FAs) by systematically analyzing the distributions of 3-OH-FA in soils, lake/river sediments and marine sediments, and propose a novel proxy (RIA, the ratio of odd carbon number iso to anteiso 3-OH-FAs) to quantificationally evaluate the contribution of OC from different components. The reliability of the RIA proxy is tested by using a three end-member model and Monte Carlo simulations along a transect from the Yangtze River estuary to the ECS shelf. Then the RIA proxy is applied to a core in the East China Sea covering the past 700 years, and the results reveal that El Nino (La Nina) induced more (less) precipitation and increased (decreased) SOC deposition. This study provides a novel approach for quantifying terrigenous OC inputs and burial in marginal seas and shows the impact of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modes on SOC loss and burial in marginal seas under global warming.

Disentangling the Drivers of the Summertime Ozone-Temperature Relationship Over the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Summertime surface-level ozone (O-3) is known to vary with temperature, but the relative roles of different processes responsible for causing the O-3-temperature relationship are not well quantified. In this study we use simulations of NASA's Global Modeling Initiative chemical transport model to isolate and assess the relative impact of atmospheric transport, chemistry, and emissions on large-scale O-3 variability, events, and and the covariance of O-3 with temperature. Using observations from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network in the contiguous United States, we show that the Global Modeling Initiative chemical transport model reproduces the spatiotemporal variability of O-3 and its relationship with temperature during the summer. We use the change in O-3 given a change in temperature (dO(3)/dT) along with other metrics to understand differences between our simulations. In regions with moderate to strong positive correlations between temperature and O-3 such as the northeast, Great Lakes, and Great Plains, temperature's association with transport yields a majority of the total O-3-temperature relationship (similar to 60%), while temperature-dependent chemistry and anthropogenic NO emissions play smaller roles (similar to 30% and similar to 10%, respectively). There are regions, however, with insignificant correlations between temperature and O-3, and our findings suggest that transport is still an important driver of O-3 variability in these regions, albeit not correlated with temperature. Transport is not directly dependent on temperature but rather is linked through an indirect association, and it is therefore important to understand the exact mechanisms that link transport to O-3 and how these mechanisms will change in a warming world.

Birds moulting at Windermere were subsequently sighted in 34 counties, although post-moult migration was mainly to the counties of Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria itself. The proportions of re-encounters in each direction away from Windermere differed statistically from the pattern expected for random dispersal, for seven out of eight directions. Resightings at Windermere showed that the number of marked individuals returning to moult decreased during the study, although numbers moulting on Windermere remained consistent throughout. We also provide new and updated information on the survival and mean dispersal distance for non-breeding Canada Geese. The mean dispersal distance away from Windermere for all marked individuals was 76 km (95% CI = 14.2). Annual mean survival rates ranged between 0.510 and 0.875 over the study period, with a geometric mean of 0.654 +/- 0.199 (95% CI = 0.556-0.751).

J	Jones, TP; Fortier, SM; Pentecost, A; Collinson, ME				Jones, TP; Fortier, SM; Pentecost, A; Collinson, ME			Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of recent charophyte oosporangia and water from Malham Tarn, UK: Palaeontological implications	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Charophyte oosporangia and water samples from a highly calcareous lake were measured for stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. The time period over which the oosporangia calcify is short, thus any biochemical relationship between the water and oosporangia's calcite represents only one 'time window' (late Summer in Malham Tarn). This important temporal restraint must also apply to interpretations of all fossil material measured. The delta(18)O(c) of the charophyte oosporangia is deduced to be in equilibrium with the delta(18)O(omega) of the water for a given temperature. The delta(13)C(c) of the charophyte oosporangia was approximately 2.5 per mil lower than the delta(13)C(DIC) in the water we measured. With the release of CO2 with phosphoric acid from the charophyte oosporangia, there was no significant difference in the delta(18)O(c) values obtained, regardless of whether or nor the carbonate was separated from the organic center, however delta(13)C(c) values were marginally lower for carbonate plus organic center measurements. Our results indicate that fossil charophyte gyrogonites can be used to elucidate the geochemistry of the ancient water body in which they lived.																			0168-2563					AUG	1996	34	2					99	112		10.1007/BF02180975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02180975													WOS:A1996VB07700003

A 33-year time course	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A permanent lake water level drawdown initiates a vegetation succession on exposed sediments. This study aims to quantify long-term vascular plant changes on the sediments in time (number of years after drawdown) and space (elevation above the new water level). Shortly after a 1.4 m permanent drawdown of Myrkdalen lake, W Norway, a 40 m long transect running from the original lowermost vegetation toward the new water level was established. Species cover percentages in the 2 m(2) study plots were determined by visual estimates and data sampling was performed from 1988 until 2020; in total, 19 times. During the study period both mean richness and plant percentage cover varied significantly in relation to space and time. Carex vesicaria and Phalaris arundinacea increased gradually especially in the lower parts. The successional changes as quantified by a DCA ordination showed rapid changes during the first 15-20 years, but later the vegetation appeared to be more stabilized. Elevation explained the mean floristic variation in a linear fashion while a quadratic model better explained the variation in relation to time. Variation in summer and June water level explained a small part of the succession change during the study period.																			1505-2249					SEP	2022	70	2-3					79	88		10.3161/15052249PJE2020.70.2.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2020.70.2.002													WOS:000952046600002

Measures of larval lake whitefish length and abundance as early predictors of year-class strength in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Many lake whitefish stocks in Lake Michigan have experienced substantial declines in growth and condition since the 1990s. Reduced growth and condition could result in reduced quality or quantity of eggs produced by spawning females, which in turn could negatively impact recruitment. We evaluated the potential for reduced recruitment by measuring early life stage density and length, and we discuss the utility of these measures as early indicators of lake whitefish year-class strength. Overall, mean larval density (number per 1000 m(3) +/- SE) in Lake Michigan was greater in 2006 (373.7 +/- 28.3) than in 2005 (16.6 +/- 24.8); whereas, mean length (mm SE) of larval lake whitefish was smaller in 2006 (12.87 +/- 0.07) than in 2005 (14.38 +/- 0.13). The ratio of zooplankton to fish density did not show an expected relationship with larval fish density or length. Rather, variation in larval density was best explained by a multiple-regression model that included larval length, spring wind intensity, and adult stock density as predictor variables. Our results suggest that the density of larval lake whitefish is not directly regulated by temperature or zooplankton density at the time of emergence, but that a potential for density-dependent regulation exists when larval emergence rates are high. We conclude that the observed declines in growth and condition of adult lake whitefish are not resulting in substantial reductions in recruitment.

J	KEDDY, PA				KEDDY, PA			EFFECTS OF COMPETITION FROM SHRUBS ON HERBACEOUS WETLAND PLANTS - A 4-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												While competition is known to occur among some species in some plant communities, we are not yet able to predict in which environments, or among which species, competitive interactions will be most intense. The objective of this study was to test for competition in a wetland plant community and then to determine which environments and which species were influenced by competition. The study site was the transition zone between shrubs and herbaceous plants on a lakeshore. To test for competitive release, shrubs were removed from treatment plots paired with controls in 25 sections of shoreline and cover of herbaceous species was monitored for 4 years. There were highly significant increases in cover, richness, and diversity in the removal plots, but less than one quarter of the individual species responded significantly. In general, these were small, partly evergreen species with high densities of buried seeds (e.g., Drosera intermedia, Hypericum boreale). On shores with frequent disturbance and low fertility there was no evidence for competitive release. The reduction in plant cover during a summer with high water levels suggests that lakeshores shift from abiotic to biotic structuring according to the water level in a particular year or series of years. Superimposed upon this is variation attributable to the type of shoreline and the type of species.																			0008-4026					MAR	1989	67	3					708	716		10.1139/b89-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b89-094													WOS:A1989U343100011

Biotic relations affecting species structure in zooplankton communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mathematical modelling and laboratory experiments were used to study how exploitative competition and predation influence the species structure in cladoceran community. For five species of Cladocera (Sida crystallina, Daphnia magna, Simocephalus vetulus, Daphnia longispina, and Diaphanosoma brachyurum), representing a gradient of body size, population characteristics were described as functions of food concentration. Abundance dynamics were simulated in mixed species cultures and invasion experiments under different levels of food supply corresponding to oligo-, meso-, and eutrophic conditions. Separate simulations were also run including and excluding (fish) predation. The competitive ability of each species was estimated as the values of the population equilibrium food concentration. Simulation results showed that for the no-predator scenario, increases in the level of food supply promoted species coexistence while under lower food concentrations only one species remained at the end of the simulation runs. When predation was allowed, the number of species that coexisted at the end of the simulations increased up to four species, indicating that predator pressure facilitated species coexistence because it shortened periods of food depletion. Simulation results were verified in laboratory experiments which suggested that population equilibrium food concentration can be used as an estimate of competitive ability. Finally, species structure and relative abundance in Lake Naroch (Belarus) during the summer of 2004 was found to be consistent with our results from computer simulation and laboratory experiments with regard to competition and predation impacts on zooplankton community.

While the region is presently hyper-arid, evidence for multiple past humid periods has been documented in previous studies. Radiocarbon dating of lacustrine, travertine and palaeogoundwater deposits suggests that the climate was humid at 10-6 and 35-25 ka. These phases have been associated with summer rainfall increases occurring in tandem with an intensification and northward migration of the monsoon system during Northern hemisphere precessional maxima. Published optical dating studies have focused on preserved sand dune and aeolianite deposits to establish ages for the intervening and phases. Here we present a summary of this work and additional optical dating results for samples of aeolian sediment from a deep drill core, which provides insights into the style of barchan dune accretion in the Liwa region of the United Arab Emirates. The large dune accreted rapidly during the mid-late Holocene. The results suggest that the transitions from humid to and conditions and resulting accumulation of aeolian sediment in the form of large bedforms occurred abruptly at around 6 ka. Further aeolian sedimentation has not been constant since that time, with initial gradual dune growth followed by rapid vertical accretion, and possible termination of accumulation around c. 2 ka.

Response of the Rhine-Meuse fluvial system to Saalian ice-sheet dynamics	BOREAS												A new reconstruction of the interaction between the Saalian Drente glaciation ice margin and the Rhine-Meuse fluvial system is presented based on a sedimentary analysis of continuous core material, archived data and a section in an ice-pushed ridge. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) was applied to obtain independent age control on these sediments and to establish a first absolute chronology for palaeogeographical events prior to and during the glaciation. We identified several Rhine and Meuse river courses that were active before the Drente glaciation (MIS 11-7). The Drente glaciation ice advance into The Netherlands (OSL-dated to fall within MIS 6) led to major re-arrangement of this drainage network. The invading ice sheet overrode existing fluvial morphology and forced the Rhine-Meuse system into a proglacial position. During deglaciation, the Rhine shifted into a basin in the formerly glaciated area, while the Meuse remained south of the former ice limit, a configuration that persisted throughout most of the Eemian and Weichselian periods. An enigmatic high position of proglacial fluvial units and their subsequent dissection during deglaciation by the Meuse may partially be explained by glacio-isostatic rebound of the area, but primarily reflects a phase of high base level related to a temporary proglacial lake in the southern North Sea area, with lake levels approximating modern sea levels. Our reconstruction indicates that full 'opening' of the Dover Strait and lowering of the Southern Bight, enabling interglacial marine exchange between the English Channel and the North Sea, is to be attributed to events during the end of MIS 6.					; Van Balen, Ronald/A-4275-2010; Busschers, Freek/HLQ-6717-2023; Wallinga, Jakob/J-4046-2017; Cohen, Kim/B-5831-2008	Van Balen, Ronald/0000-0002-8019-7426; Wallinga, Jakob/0000-0003-4061-3066; Kasse, Cornelis/0000-0002-1466-1016; Cohen, Kim/0000-0002-0095-3990													0300-9483	1502-3885					2008	37	3					377	398		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00025.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00025.x													WOS:000257550400003

Methane turnover and environmental change from Holocene lipid biomarker records in a thermokarst lake in Arctic Alaska	HOLOCENE												Arctic lakes and wetlands contribute a substantial amount of methane to the contemporary atmosphere, yet profound knowledge gaps remain regarding the intensity and climatic control of past methane emissions from this source. In this study, we reconstruct methane turnover and environmental conditions, including estimates of mean annual and summer temperature, from a thermokarst lake (Lake Qalluuraq) on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska for the Holocene by using source-specific lipid biomarkers preserved in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core. Our results document a more prominent role for methane in the carbon cycle when the lake basin was an emergent fen habitat between similar to 12,300 and similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a time period closely coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in North Alaska. Enhanced methane turnover was stimulated by relatively warm temperatures, increased moisture, nutrient supply, and primary productivity. After similar to 10,000 cal yr BP, a thermokarst lake with abundant submerged mosses evolved, and through the mid-Holocene temperatures were approximately 3 degrees C cooler. Under these conditions, organic matter decomposition was attenuated, which facilitated the accumulation of submerged mosses within a shallower Lake Qalluuraq. Reduced methane assimilation into biomass during the mid-Holocene suggests that thermokarst lakes are carbon sinks during cold periods. In the late-Holocene from similar to 2700 cal yr BP to the most recent time, however, temperatures and carbon deposition rose and methane oxidation intensified, indicating that more rapid organic matter decomposition and enhanced methane production could amplify climate feedback via potential methane emissions in the future.					; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/C-7675-2009; Becker, Kevin/AAF-9506-2021	Gaglioti, Benjamin/0000-0003-0591-5253; Hinrichs, Kai-Uwe/0000-0002-0739-9291; Becker, Kevin W./0000-0001-6317-1884; Elvert, Marcus/0000-0003-3863-0975													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2016	26	11					1766	1777		10.1177/0959683616645942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616645942													WOS:000385859800003

Settling and suspended sediments, as well as air and water samples, were collected in southern Lake Michigan over a 12 month period. Analysis of contaminant fluxes on settling particles shows that approximately 370 kg of PCBs and 110 kg of DDT compounds are resuspended in southern Lake Michigan during a single basin-wide event ( January 1999). Examination of contaminant signals indicates strong regional and temporal source-receptor relationships between settling, suspended, and surficial sediments. The settling, suspended, and bottom surficial sediments in the shallow waters of the southern coastal region are enriched in lower molecular weight PCBs. The sediments in the water column and on the lake bottom in the deeper regions are enriched in higher molecular weight PCBs. Furthermore, falling sediments collected in the deeper regions of the lake are enriched in 4,4'-DDT. The unique contaminant signal in deep water regions is surprising and suggests a source/receptor relationship among the bottom sediments and the sediments suspended and settling above them.					; Hornbuckle, Keri/JCO-2746-2023; Smith, Geoffrey/G-2894-2012	Hornbuckle, Keri/0000-0002-3478-3221; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY 18	2004	109	C5							C05017	10.1029/2003JC001917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JC001917													WOS:000221611900001
J	Walton, B				Walton, Barry			Briefing: St Nicholas Abbey historic railway project, St Peter, Barbados, West Indies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING HISTORY AND HERITAGE												The estate of St Nicholas Abbey sits on hilly coralline limestone overlooking the east coast of Barbados, north of the Scotland District basin (13.20 degrees north, 59.54 degrees west). The area is characterised by deep gullies and a mix of cap coral, hard-to-soft limestone, coral rubble and voids. The estate is dominated by a Jacobean mansion, a rehabilitated 1658 sugar plantation and latterly a narrow-gauge tourist railway. The railway has a 671 m long circular loop on an embankment forming a man-made lake, a station and reception facilities. Switches connect the loop to a sinuous 670 m long single line through an almost continuous cutting to a terminus and turntable at the top of Cherry Tree Hill escarpment, a noted Barbados lookout point. The project involved a large earth-moving plant for the lake and railway cuttings. It included recovered former sugar industry assets, modern recycled materials and an inventory of rolling stock; two diesel locomotives, a 1916 steam locomotive successfully rehabilitated in England, three carriages and a flatbed car. Commissioning of the scheme took place in the winter of 2018/2019, and the commercial operation started early in 2019. Staff training and orientation are using UK heritage railway best-practice guidelines.																			1757-9430	1757-9449				NOV	2019	172	4					148	151	1900014	10.1680/jenhh.19.00014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/jenhh.19.00014													WOS:000488107600002

Tellervo			An alloherpesvirus infection of European perch Perca fluviatilis in Finland	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												The order Herpesvirales includes viruses that infect aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates and several aquatic invertebrates (i.e. mollusks), and share the commonality of possessing a double-stranded DNA core surrounded by an icosahedral capsid. Herpesviruses of the family Alloherpesvmdae that infect fish and amphibians, including channel catfish virus and koi herpesvirus, negatively impact aquaculture. Here, we describe a novel herpesvirus infection of wild European perch fiom lakes m Finland. Infected fish exhibited white nodules on the skin and fins, typically in the spring when prevalence reached nearly 40% m one of the sampled lakes. Transmission electron microscopic examination of affected tissues revealed abundant nuclear and cytoplasmic virus particles displaying heipesvirus morphology. Degenerate PGR taigetmg a conserved region of the DNA polymerase gene of large DNA viruses amplified a 520 bp product in 5 of 5 affected perch skm samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial DNA polymerase and teimmase (exon 2) gene sequences produced a well-supported tree grouping the European perch herpesvirus with alloherpesviruses infecting acipensend, esocid, ictalurid, and salmonid fishes. The phenetic analysis of the European perch herpesvirus partial DNA polymerase and teimmase nucleotide gene sequences ranged fiom 34.6 to 63.9% and 39.6 to 59.6% to other alloherpesviruses, respectively. These data support the European perch herpesvirus as a new alloherpesvirus, and we propose the formal species designation of Percid herpesvirus 2 (PeHV2) to be considered for approval by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

In order to understand the background of the construction of the water conservancy project, we sampled and analyzed the ancient river profile TS20W13 near the water conservancy facilities. Sedimentology demonstrated that the 4th to 6th layers of the TS20W13 profile were the strongest stage of hydrodynamic force in the river. The Zr/Rb and Ba/Nb values indicated that the 4th to 7th layers might have been those layers of a time of frequent flooding in this ancient river. The results of zircon psephicity analysis also showed that the psephicity of the zircon at the 4th to 6th layers were the best, indicating that along this stage of the river, the average transporting force was the strongest. According to the OSL dating results and the above analysis, at around 4.0 ka BP, the Hongqiaocun Site was in the midst of a flood-prone period, which was synchronous with the ancient flood records of the Yangtze River and Yellow River Basin. The increase in flooding during this period might be related to the aggravation of climatic fluctuation by about 4.0 ka BP. In the context of the above environmental background, the ancient people at the Hongqiaocun Site built water conservancy facilities to withstand floods.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2020	185								104296	10.1016/j.catena.2019.104296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104296													WOS:000504504500032
J	Brkic, Z				Brkic, Zeljka			Increasing water temperature of the largest freshwater lake on the Mediterranean islands as an indicator of global warming	HELIYON												Global warming has been monitored for many years. The increase in air temperature and changes in the distribution and frequency of high temperatures are recorded continually. Lakes are one of the important water resources for aquatic ecosystems and water supply, which are significantly affected by global warming. The increase in lake water temperature increases the evaporation from the free lake surface, lowering the lake level, and changes the water quality. In the last few decades, analysis of changes in lake water temperature has been increasing. In situ measurements of water temperature in Vrana Lake on Cres island (Croatia), the largest freshwater lake on the Mediterranean islands, were analysed over 43 years. The results showed that the mean annual lake surface water temperature (LSWT) increased by 0.47 degrees C decade-1 (p < 0.0001). The increase in the mean annual lake summer surface water temperature (July-September) was 0.44 <degrees>C decade-1 (p < 0.0001), and the maximum annual LSWT was 0.56 <degrees>C decade-1 (p < 0.0001). All these amounts are in accordance with the published data on the increase in water temperature in the investigated European lakes. The number of days with LSWT higher than 25 <degrees>C increased by almost 9 d decade-1. An increase in the minimum LSWT (0.17 degrees C decade-1) corresponding to isothermal conditions was also determined but was not statistically significant. The minimum mean monthly LSWT increased by 0.36 degrees C decade-1 (p < 0.0001). Because the increase in water temperature can negatively affect the lake's ecosystem, and become a threat to safe water supply; LSWT, thermal stratification and evaporation should be continuously monitored. The impacts of climate warming on the lake stratification and aquatic ecosystems need to be further investigated.																				2405-8440				AUG	2023	9	8							e19248	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19248		AUG 2023						37654467					WOS:001066961800001

Nonetheless, a vast majority of these studies fall short of a full assessment of the underlying relationship between functionality and coordinated development relationships between the habitat and threat variables. To comprehensively analyze the stability of the waterbird habitat in the Zhangjiangkou Mangrove National Nature Reserve (ZMNNR), this study offers a unique technique that integrates the functionality of the waterbird habitat with the coordinated development of habitat and threat variables in a GIS environment over a three-decade timeframe (1990-2020). The findings revealed that the very stable region of the research site grew by nearly 50% throughout the three -decade study period, with a substantial portion concentrated around the mangrove reserve. This growing dis-tribution of highly stable sections in the mangrove reserve was believed to be the outcome of progressive expansion in habitat functioning and the region's counterbalanced interaction between habitat and threat var-iables. A comparison of stability within and beyond the mangrove reserve border found that an unbalanced link between habitat and threat variables resulted in a 23% decline in stability outside the mangrove reserve boundary. From 2020 to 2050, this deterioration was expected to worsen, eventually affecting more than half of the territory. Further investigation found that habitat type and area, ecosystem service value, habitat fragmentation, and wetness were all identified as the primary driving mechanisms influencing changes in habitat stability. Moreover, these driving forces were shown to have varied influences on changes in waterbird habitat stability. This approach's capacity to successfully analyze and discover significant regions of waterbird habitat and zones with a coordinated relationship between habitat and threat variables makes it a valuable technical reference tool to aid decision-makers in habitat conservation and eco-restoration studies.					; yan, xu/JMR-0690-2023; Ikhumhen, Harrison/AHA-1348-2022; Meilana, Lusita/NLO-1534-2025; Fang, Qinhua/G-3950-2010	Yang, Suzhen/0000-0002-1877-1132; Meilana, Lusita/0000-0003-1674-383X													1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2022	72								101871	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101871		OCT 2022											WOS:000879224400001
J	Kjærstad, G; Arnekleiv, JV; Velle, G; Finstad, AG				Kjaerstad, Gaute; Arnekleiv, Jo Vegar; Velle, Gaute; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot			Long-term responses of benthic invertebrates to rotenone treatment	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Biological invasions are regarded as one of the largest threats to native biodiversity. The eradication of alien invasive fish or parasites by culling of hosts is a controversial conservation strategy, particularly when using indiscriminate methods involving whole ecosystem collateral damage. While short-term effects are abundantly documented, long-term surveys needed to detect potential wider ecosystem effects are scarce. Here, we report a five-year study on effects of the piscicide rotenone on invertebrate communities from a Norwegian watercourse using a Before-After-Control-Impact design. Kick-net samples of benthic invertebrates were collected from three lentic sampling stations and two lotic stations two to four times per year in both a treated and nearby control catchment. In general, only relatively minor short-term effects, measured as temporal beta-diversity of benthic invertebrates, were observed in lentic and lotic locations following rotenone treatment. However, the lotic fauna was severely negatively affected following a period of long-term rotenone exposure from a late autumn treated upstream lake where rotenone degradation was slow, likely due to low temperatures. Species turnover co-varied markedly between control and treatment locations, indicating that natural environmental variation override effects of rotenone treatment. Likewise, the abundance of invertebrate taxa varied considerably both over time and between control and treatment locations. Our study indicates minor short-term (i.e., <1 month) or long-term (i.e., 4 years) effects of rotenone treatment on benthic invertebrates, but severe effects on the lotic fauna 8 months after treatment following long-term low-dose exposure. This suggests that exposure time is of high importance. The findings from the current study therefore highlight both the importance of long-term monitoring including control sites for the study of rotenone treatment effects on benthic invertebrates as well as the importance of minimizing exposure time.					; Finstad, Anders/H-6519-2015; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/H-6519-2015	Kjaerstad, Gaute/0000-0001-8900-219X; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/0000-0003-4529-6266													1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2022	38	8			SI		1436	1449		10.1002/rra.3919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3919		DEC 2021											WOS:000730858600001

In Korea, during the summer of 2012, a geosmin outbreak in the drinking water supply prompted further research to identify the source of the odorous materials, since these occurrences were not well understood or monitored. The purpose of this study was to investigate how important a role actinomycetes play in the production of geosmin and 2-MIB in Paldang Lake by measurement of microbial density (the number of colony-forming units), pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and determination of the prevalence of the geosmin synthase gene. Three sampling sites (P1, P2, and P3) were selected. The increase in geosmin concentration was paralleled by an increase in actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp.) and cyanobacteria (Anabaena spp.) populations. The bacterial communities in Paldang Lake were characterized by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. P1 (North Han River) showed the highest density of actinomycetes, followed by P2 (Paldang Dam), and P3 (South Han River). The density of Streptomyces spp. increased at P1, while that of cyanobacteria increased at P3. No significant density change was noted in those two species at P2, a confluence of two rivers. The genes producing geosmin or 2-MIB were detected in 60 single strains that were isolated from water samples in Paldang Lake. This study confirmed that Streptomyces spp. significantly affect the production of geosmin that causes odors in Paldang Lake.

J	Peter, A; Köster, O; Schildknecht, A; von Gunten, U				Peter, Andreas; Koester, Oliver; Schildknecht, Andrea; von Gunten, Urs			Occurrence of dissolved and particle-bound taste and odor compounds in Swiss lake waters	WATER RESEARCH												The occurrence of algal taste and odor (T&O) compounds was investigated in three Swiss lakes which exhibit different nutrient levels from eutrophic to oligotrophic (Lake Greifensee, Lake Zurich and Lake Lucerne). Apart from dissolved T&O compounds, the study also encompassed particle-bound compounds, i.e., compounds that can be released from damaged algal cells during drinking water treatment. A combined instrumental (SPME-GC-MS) and sensory method was applied that allowed to detect and quantify T&O compounds in natural waters in the sub ppt to low ppt-range. In addition to the prominent T&O compounds geosmin and 2-methyl-isoborneol (MIB), four other T&O compounds could be detected in the lake waters, though all at relatively low concentrations (maximum concentrations of geosmin 19 ng L-1, MIB 3 ng L-1, beta-ionone 27 ng L-1, beta-cyclocitral 7 ng L-1, 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine 2 ng L-1, 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine 16 ng L-1). The concentration peaks typically occurred in the epilimnion during summer concurrent with a high phytoplankton biomass. Consistently, the concentration levels for most of the compounds varied substantially between the three lakes and generally decreased in the order eutrophic Lake Greifensee > mesotrophic Lake Zurich > oligotrophic Lake Lucerne. Furthermore, our data revealed that the occurrence of beta-ionone was largely influenced by Planktothrix rubescens. This is the first time that a correlation between beta-ionone and this cyanobacterium has been reported for natural waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Accuracy of data buoys for measurement of cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, and turbidity in a large lake (Lake Erie, North America): implications for estimation of cyanobacterial bloom parameters from water quality sonde measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Microcystin (MCY)-producing harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cHABs) are an annual occurrence in Lake Erie, and buoys equipped with water quality sondes have been deployed to help researchers and resource managers track cHABs. The objective of this study was to determine how well water quality sondes attached to buoys measure total algae and cyanobacterial biomass and water turbidity. Water samples were collected next to two data buoys in western Lake Erie (near Gibraltar Island and in the Sandusky subbasin) throughout summers 2015, 2016, and 2017 to determine correlations between buoy sonde data and water sample data. MCY and nutrient concentrations were also measured. Significant (P < 0.001) linear relationships (R-2 > 0.75) occurred between cyanobacteria buoy and water sample data at the Gibraltar buoy, but not at the Sandusky buoy; however, the coefficients at the Gibraltar buoy differed significantly across years. There was a significant correlation between buoy and water sample total chlorophyll data at both buoys, but the coefficient varied considerably between buoys and among years. Total MCY concentrations at the Gibraltar buoy followed similar temporal patterns as buoy and water sample cyanobacterial biomass data, and the ratio of MCY to cyanobacteria-chlorophyll decreased with decreased ambient nitrate concentrations. These results suggest that buoy data are difficult to compare across time and space. Additionally, the inclusion of nitrate concentration data can lead to more robust predictions on the relative toxicity of blooms. Overall, deployed buoys with sondes that are routinely cleaned and calibrated can track relative cyanobacteria abundance and be used as an early warning system for potentially toxic blooms.

We employed a summed component ecosystem approach for assessing lake-wide and functional group-specific metabolism (gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R)) in shallow and eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv in central Estonia during three years. Eleven functional groups were considered: piscivorous and benthivorous fish; phyto-, bacterio-, proto-and metazooplankton; benthic macroinvertebrates, bacteria and ciliates; macrophytes and their associated epiphytes. Metabolism of these groups was assessed by allometric equations coupled with daily records of temperature and hydrology of the lake and measurements of food web functional groups biomass. Results revealed that heterotrophy dominated most of the year, with a short autotrophic period observed in late spring. Most of the metabolism of the lake could be attributed to planktonic functional groups, with phytoplankton contributing the highest share (90% of GPP and 43% of R). A surge of protozooplankton and bacterioplankton populations forming the microbial loop caused the shift from auto-to heterotrophy in midsummer. Conversely, the benthic functional groups had overall a very small contribution to lake metabolism. We validated our ecosystem approach by comparing the GPP and R with those calculated from O-2 measurements in the lake. Our findings are also in line with earlier productivity studies made with C-14 or chlorophyll a (chl-a) based equations. Ideally, the ecosystem approach should be combined with diel O-2 approach for investigating critical periods of metabolism shifts caused by dynamics in food-web processes.					; Kõiv, Toomas/H-3466-2016; Zingel, Priit/H-8822-2016; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016; Agasild, Helen/AGG-7498-2022; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Kisand, Veljo/H-2466-2012; Koiv, Toomas/H-3466-2016; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; Cremona, Fabien/D-1385-2013	Agasild, Helen/0000-0002-4926-9807; Zingel, Priit/0000-0003-1629-2063; Laas, Alo/0000-0002-4801-0377; Kisand, Veljo/0000-0002-5535-1639; Koiv, Toomas/0000-0002-0051-3952; Cremona, Fabien/0000-0002-0559-6259													1932-6203					JUL 11	2014	9	7							e101845	10.1371/journal.pone.0101845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101845								25014117					WOS:000339378400040

Although entrapment records indicated a decline in whitefish abundance since the 1970s, recent mortality attributable to this factor was negligible. Whitefish entrapped during the early 1990s were dominated by fish of only a few year-classes, contrasting with those entrapped during the mid 1960s which also exhibited higher ultimate size. Moreover, echo sounding in recent years confirmed that the whitefish population was sparse, with an estimated adult stock of 2,574 individuals (geometric mean, lower and upper 95 % confidence limits of 1,017 and 6.512 individuals, respectively) in 1992 which decreased significantly to 383 individuals(106 and 1,375 individuals, respectively) in 1996. Examination of long-term lake level data revealed that in some years considerable changes occurred during the whitefish spawning period of January to March, and that there had been a significant increase in the ranges of such levels from the early 1960s to the present. Level fluctuations during the summer months were more marked and had significantly increased in both mean and range in recent years? with a likely adverse effect on the ecology of young whitefish.

J	HOFSLUND, PB				HOFSLUND, PB			HAWK MIGRATION OVER WESTERN TIP OF LAKE SUPERIOR	WILSON BULLETIN												Duluth, Minnesota, can lay claim to one of the great hawk flyways of the world. The consistency of the flyway through the fall migration is quite remarkable when one considers that it does not appear to have the natural features apparent in some of the other Great Lakes areas. Therefore, it is paramount to search for more than one factor operating toward making it a major migration focal point. The factors that are important are: a modified funnel formed by the lake and a range of hills, with Duluth at the funnel tip; a forest triangle that would direct both western and eastern breeding birds toward Duluth; a natural tendency of the hawks to move toward the southwest; freemoving thermals that could pile up against the lake on winds with a westerly component; and the possible effect of Lake Superior as a guideline. Because of these factors, it is assumed that the supply comes from the east through a possible island hopping, the west from natural tendencies to stay with the forested areas and the movements of thermals on a westerly wind, and from the north by virtue of the natural funnel previously mentioned.																			0043-5643						1966	78	1					79	+																WOS:A19667542900009

Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) is an active, non-imaging, remote sensing technology for measuring the depths of shallow and relatively transparent water bodies using light beams from an airborne platform. In this study, we acquired Lidar datasets using near-infrared and visible (green) wavelength with the Leica Airborne Hydrography AB Chiroptera-I system over the Devils River basin of southwestern Texas. Devils River is a highly groundwater-dependent stream that flows 150 km from source springs to Lake Amistad on the lower Rio Grande. To improve spatially distributed stream bathymetry in aquatic habitats of species of state and federal conservation interest, we conducted supplementary water-depth observations using other remote sensing technologies integrated with the airborne Lidar datasets. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) mapped the river bottom where vegetation impeded other active sensors in attaining depth measurements. We confirmed the accuracy of bathymetric Lidar datasets with a differential global positioning system (GPS) and compared the findings to sonar and GPR measurements. The study revealed that seamless bathymetric and geomorphic mapping of karst environments in complex settings (e.g., aquatic vegetation, entrained air bubbles, riparian zone obstructions) require the integration of a variety of terrestrial and remotely operated survey methods. We apply this approach to Devils River of Texas. However, the methods are applicable to similar streams globally.

The purpose of this study is to investigate and understand the weather conditions associated with AI based on observations in order to improve the icing forecast. To achieve this goal, Environment and Climate Change Canada in cooperation with the Department of National Defence deployed a number of ground-based instruments that include a microwave radiometer, a ceilometer, disdrometers, and conventional present weather sensors at the Cold Lake airport (CYOD). A number of pilot reports (PIREPs) of icing at Cold Lake during the 2016/17 winter period and associated observation data are examined. Most of the AI events were LGT (76%) followed by MOD (20%) and occurred during landing and takeoff at relatively warm temperatures. Two AI intensity algorithms have been tested based on an ice accumulation rate (IAR) assuming a cylindrical shape moving with airspeed upsilon(a) of 60 and 89.4 m s(-1), and the Canadian numerical weather prediction model forecasts. It was found that the algorithms IAR(2) with upsilon(a) = 89.4 m s(-1) and IAR(1) with upsilon(a) = 60 m s(-1) underestimated (overestimated) the LGT (MOD) icing events, respectively. The algorithm IAR(2) with upsilon(a) = 60 m s(-1) appeared to be more suitable for forecasting LGT icing. Over all, the hit rate score was 0.33 for the 1200 UTC model run and 0.6 for 0000 UTC run for both algorithms, but based on the individual icing intensity scores, the IAR(2) did better than IAR(1) for forecasting LGT icing events.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				JUN	2019	34	3					485	506		10.1175/WAF-D-18-0037.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-18-0037.1													WOS:000466529200001

Variation in the mean winter El Ni (n) over tildeo - Southern Oscillation Index was strongly correlated with drought conditions ( zero flow days) in the study streams. Drought onset and duration varied among study streams and among years. Below- average precipitation coincided with the occurrence of drought, although it remains unclear if snowfall and rainfall contributed equally to the impact of decreased precipitation. Increased relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera ( EPT) one year following drought and decreased relative abundance two years after drought indicated high resistance but poor resilience. In contrast, chironomids showed poor resistance and high resilience. Although these patterns were not consistent across all streams, temporal coherence among streams was found in percent EPT, percent chironomids, and percent dipterans, suggesting that drought acts as a disturbance mechanism that simplifies benthos community assemblages. Biocriteria developed from 22 nearby reference streams indicated that abnormal BMI communities occurred only after recurring episodes of drought, indicating that the effects of drought are cumulative. Headwater streams may prove to be sentinel ecosystems for monitoring the impacts of climate change.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2008	65	5					890	905		10.1139/F08-057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F08-057													WOS:000255671700010
J	Hamilton, PB; Gajewski, K; Atkinson, DE; Lean, DRS				Hamilton, PB; Gajewski, K; Atkinson, DE; Lean, DRS			Physical and chemical limnology of 204 lakes from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The physical and chemical limnology of 204 takes from across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was examined. Mean summer air temperature did not correlate well with lake chlorophyll levels due to the predominance of ultra-oligotrophic hard-water lakes located in a polar climate. Local geology influences ion budgets and is an important factor in determining pelagic phosphorus availability, carbon cycling and metal concentrations. Ratios Of particulate carbon, particulate nitrogen and chlorophyll a indicate that planktonic microorganisms are not always the major producers of organic carbon in arctic lakes. Allochthonous particulate matter contributes significantly to the carbon and phosphorus budgets of small and mid-sized lakes across the Arctic, although the availability of these elements is controlled by many interacting geochemical and biological factors. Phosphorus is generally limiting, however, increases in available phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon are all required to make significant long-term differences in lake productivity. Particulate phosphorus levels call be high in lakes where phosphorus-rich shales or carbonatite bedrock are present. These phosphorus-enriched lakes are found in several areas across the mid-arctic islands, however, only small amounts of this nutrient are available as soluble reactive phosphorus. Although lakes throughout the Arctic are typically ultra-oligotrophic, they still represent all important sink for allochthonous nutrient deposition.

J	Mandrak, NE; Cudmore, B				Mandrak, Nicholas E.; Cudmore, B.			The fall of Native Fishes and the rise of Non-native Fishes in the Great Lakes Basin	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Over the last 200 years, the fish fauna of the Great Lakes has changed significantly as a result of declines in native species and the deliberate and inadvertent stocking of non-native fishes. These changes have resulted in the global extinction of three taxa and the extirpation of 18 species lowering the number of currently extant native species in the Great Lakes basin from 169 to 148 species. A further 82 species have declined to the point of endangerment in at least one jurisdiction in the basin. The causes of these declines are primarily habitat alterations, aquatic invasive species, and overexploitation. Some significant changes in the fish fauna of the Great Lakes basin have also been the result of the successful introduction and establishment of 35 non-native species. In addition, 34 non-native species have been found in the basin, but have not, or are not thought to have, established reproducing populations. These species have been introduced through a variety of pathways including commercial shipping, dispersal, live trade, recreational boating and angling, and stocking. Many of these species have substantially impacted the Great Lakes ecosystem directly through predation and competition or indirectly through trophic disruption and disease transmission. The relative importance of pathways as a source of new introductions has changed over time, and can be expected to continue to change as a result of evolving regulations and trade patterns. The fish fauna of the Great Lakes basin will continue to change as the result of continuing threats to native species and ongoing introductions of non-native species, and such change will undoubtedly be influenced by climate change and human population growth.

Lawrence			Climatic implication of stalagmite δ13C in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River since the Last Glacial Maximum and coupling with δ18O	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The relationship between monsoon circulation and regional hydrology in the Yangtze River Basin since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remains unclear. In this study, we present speleothem (LS46) delta O-18 and delta C-13 records over the past 23.5 kyr from the Luoshui Cave in Central China. Stalagmite L546 delta C-13 displayed a good similarity with variations in delta D-wax-derived monsoon precipitation from Lake TengchongQinghai (TCQH) and the extreme precipitation events identified by the IRMsoft-flux from Heshang Cave, thus indicating that speleothem calcite delta C-13 reflects the changes in regional hydrology. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and wavelet spectrum analyses revealed that the regional hydrology was paced by similar to 2000-year periodicity during the LGM and last deglaciation and similar to 1000-year periodicity during the Holocene, respectively. Our results further indicated that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays an important role in regulating changes in the frequency and magnitude of regional hydrology in the Yangtze River Basin under different climatic conditions. Moreover, our results demonstrated that delta O-18 and delta C-13 were coupled on multiple timescales, thus potentially indicating that local hydrological variations in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are regulated by large-scale monsoonal circulation. However, we also found that the delta O-18 and delta C-13 profiles decoupled during the last deglaciation, likely due to a decrease in evapotranspiration in combination with a decrease in monsoon intensity and temperature during this period. Consequently, the regional hydrological conditions did not experience any dramatic changes.

To provide high-quality age control for detailed palaeoclimate reconstructions based on the TP archive, (crypto)tephra studies of a peat core 'TP-2005' have been carried out for the 0-130 ka interval. The results show that the TP basin is ideally positioned to receive tephra fall from both the Italian and Aegean Arc volcanic provinces. Two visible tephra layers, the Santorini Cape Riva/Y-2 (c. 22 ka) and the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI)/Y-5 (c. 39.8 ka) tephras, and six primary cryptotephra layers, namely the early Holocene El tephra from the Aeolian Islands (c. 8.3 ka), the Campanian Y-3 (c. 29 ka) and X-6 tephras (c. 109.5 ka), as well as counterpart tephras TM-18-1d (c. 40.4 ka), TM-23-11 (c. 92.4 ka) and TM-33-la (c. 116.7 ka) from the Lago Grande di Monticchio sequence (southern Italy), were identified along with repeatedly redeposited Y-2 and CI tephra material. Bayesian modelling of the ages of seven of the primary tephra layers, 60 radiocarbon measurements and 20 palynological control points have been applied to markedly improve the chronology of the TP archive. This revised chronology constrains the age of tephra TM-18-1d to 40.90-41.66 cal ka BP (95.4% range). Several tephra layers identified in the TP record form important isochrons for correlating this archive with other terrestrial (e.g., Lago Grande di Monticchio, Sulmona Basin and Lake Ohrid) and marine (e.g., Adriatic Sea core PRAD 1-2 and Aegean Sea core LC21) palaeoclimate records in the Mediterranean region.

Nearly 800 isolates were picked after incubation on several growth media at different temperatures. They were grouped using a whole-genome fingerprinting technique, repetitive element palindromic PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of 82 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to four major phylogenetic groups: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. A relatively large difference between the samples was apparent. Forlidas Pond is a completely frozen water body underlain by hypersaline brine, with summer thaw forming a slightly saline littoral moat. This was reflected in the bacterial diversity with a dominance of isolates belonging to Firmicutes, whereas isolates from the freshwater Lundstrom Lake revealed a dominance of Actinobacteria. A total of 42 different genera were recovered, including first records from Antarctica for Albidiferax, Bosea, Curvibacter, Luteimonas, Ornithinibacillus, Pseudoxanthomonas, Sphingopyxis and Spirosoma. Additionally, a considerable number of potential new species and new genera were recovered distributed over different phylogenetic groups. For several species where previously only the type strain was available in cultivation, we report additional strains. Comparison with public databases showed that overall, 72% of the phylotypes are cosmopolitan whereas 23% are currently only known from Antarctica. However, for the Bacteroidetes, the majority of the phylotypes recovered are at present known only from Antarctica and many of these represent previously unknown species.

J	Jansen, N				Jansen, Nils			The Idea of Legal Responsibility	OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES												The article analyses and reconstructs a broad idea of legal responsibility which underlies and normatively links tort law with the law of unjustified enrichment. The article's central proposition is that responsibility for damage caused and enrichment-responsibility are closely interrelated. Both aspects of obligations are equally an expression of corrective justice, and ultimately serve to protect the civil rights of citizens. It is shown that the idea of civil equality and the principle against unjustified enrichment require citizens to assume responsibility not only for the consequences of their misbehaviour, but also for the consequences of lawful actions that non-reciprocally endanger the rights of others. This can be seen particularly clearly in cases of necessity like Vincent v Lake Erie. Under current law, those cases fall in between the categories of unjustified enrichment and wrongs; in most legal systems, they are therefore regarded as particularly hard cases. Nevertheless, the liability of a person lawfully causing damage in a situation of necessity exemplifies the idea of legal responsibility, and thus helps in better understanding the law of non-contractual obligations. Methodologically, the article combines historical arguments derived from the late scholastic theory of restitution with a comparative analysis of Western legal systems and contemporary private law theory. This approach is designed to overcome the conceptual boundaries of national private laws on both sides of the English Channel; it may help to address difficult legal problems more appropriately.																			0143-6503	1464-3820				SUM	2014	34	2					221	252		10.1093/ojls/gqt031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqt031													WOS:000337078600002
J	Vanderploeg, HA; Liebig, JR; Gluck, AA				Vanderploeg, HA; Liebig, JR; Gluck, AA			Evaluation of different phytoplankton for supporting development of zebra mussel larvae (Dreissena polymorpha): The importance of size and polyunsaturated fatty acid content	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A marine alga and variety of freshwater algae of known polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition were evaluated in the laboratory for their ability to promote development of Dreissena polymorpha from egg through settling and metamorphosis. The three species of algae which promoted development-the marine and the freshwater strain of Chlorella minutissima and the cryptophyte Rhodomonas minuta-were all rich in long-chain (greater than or equal to 18 C) n-3 PUFAs, including some 20:5 or 22:6 PUFAs. Dreissena's need for long-chain n-3 PUFAs is consistent with the needs of marine bivalves and freshwater zooplankton. Larval growth rate on the freshwater strain of C. minutissima was about the same as that for R. minuta, but much faster than that for the marine strain of C. minutissima. Mean ages at settling for larvae fed the freshwater C. minutissima were 15 d at 26 degrees C, 17 d at 24 degrees C, and 22 d at 22 degrees C. Low survival rates reported for the larvae in nature may be related to low concentrations of long-chain n-3 PUFAs in blue-green and some green algae that dominate eutrophic lakes in summer.

It comprises seven texturally different facies: phytoherm framestone facies, phytoherm boundstone facies, micritic tufa facies, crossbedded carbonate sandstone facies, carbonate-coated conglomerate facies, pebbly carbonate sandstone facies, and tufa breccias facies. Of these, the phytoherm framestone facies and the phytoherm boundstone facies were deposited at the peripheral part of lake, whereas the micritic tufa facies toward the lake depocenter. Tufa breccias facies and crossbedded carbonate sandstone facies were resulted from erosion and redeposition of fragments from previously formed units such as phytoherm framestone and boundstone by fluvial activities developed within the environment. The tufa samples are composed of low-Mg calcite, and the terrigenous material in all tufa facies is generally very low. C and O isotop data show that the deposition of the AydA +/- ncA +/- k tufa took place under cold water condition. The sedimentological and mineralogical characteristics of the facies points that the AydA +/- ncA +/- k tufa was deposited in a fluvio-lacustrine environment in which the terrigen input was very low and was feeded by water from springs developed along the faults close to the Aydincik tufa.																			0891-2556	1878-5212				DEC	2015	30	4					451	459		10.1007/s13146-015-0244-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-015-0244-7													WOS:000365094000007
J	TREE, AJ				TREE, AJ			BIOLOGY OF THE GREENSHANK IN SOUTHERN-AFRICA	OSTRICH												The greenshank T. nebularia is a widespread visitor to southern Africa but is only normally common at favored coastal sites. First migrants arrive at the end of July and the last birds leave in early May. Small numbers overwinter. Birds in the interior are forced to move coastward or southwestward once the summer rains set in and rapidly inundate suitable habitat. Peak numbers occur in Jan. at Port Alfred, a coastal site. Greatest concentrations of greenshanks occur on eutrophic bodies of water in the interior while at coastal localities the density of prawns may determine greenshank numbers. It is normally a diurnal feeder but will feed at night in tidal areas when fattening up for return migration. It roosts communally standing in shallow water. Birds can be aged on plumage condition and primary feather molt. Birds have a lean mass of about 170 g while the potential migratory range on fat deposits accumulated is calculated to carry birds from the Cape coast to the East African lakes and thence to the Mediterranean or Caspian Seas. There is a considerable disparity in mass between inland and coastal localities. One banding recovery in Cyprus is noted; a low retrap rate is gradually being improved by color ringing.																			0030-6525	1727-947X					1979	50	4					240	251		10.1080/00306525.1979.9634119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00306525.1979.9634119													WOS:A1979JH22400007

In the present study, 8 water samples were collected in East China: 2 from lakes, 2 from rivers, 2 from reservoirs, a well and a mountain spring. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 (UVA), specific UVA (SUVA) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were determined in raw water samples; formation of 9 HAA species as well as bromine substitution factor (BSF) were measured in chlorinated water samples. Results showed that water samples located in city generally contained higher levels of DOC (6.4-122 mg/L) and UVA (0.124-0.194/cm), while those in the country side, low DOC (2.4-5.9 mg/L) and UVA (0.061-0.109/cm) levels were observed. Negative relationship (p < 0.01) was found between SUVA values and Chl-a levels. Among 9 HAA species, 4 brominated HAA were detected. As for BAA and DBAA (i.e. Br-HAAs), their yields (m/L) were significant related (p < 0.05) with DOC: In terms of BCAA and BDCAA (i.e. ClBr-HAAs), they were not only related with DOC, but also with UVA. These two results were quite different from DCAA and TCAA (Cl-HAAs), whose yields (mu g/mg C) were only correlated with SUVA values, suggesting that precursors of Cl-HAA, Br-HAA and CIBr-HAA were different from each other, and their aromaticity/hydrophobicity may be in the order of Br-HAA < CIBr-HAA Interrelationship between Br/DOC, SUVA and BSF revealed that BSF can be influenced by SUVA and Br/DOC, but in comparison, Br/UVA was the best indicator to describe BSF. This pattern is not only true in di-HAAs and tri-HAAs in this study, but also valid in other water samples and other species of disinfection by-product (e.g. trihalomethanes, dihaloacetonitriles, trihalonitromethanes).

J	Theroux, S; Huang, YS; Amaral-Zettler, L				Theroux, Susanna; Huang, Yongsong; Amaral-Zettler, Linda			Comparative molecular microbial ecology of the spring haptophyte bloom in a Greenland arctic oligosaline lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The Arctic is highly sensitive to increasing global temperatures and is projected to experience dramatic ecological shifts in the next few decades. Oligosaline lakes are common in arctic regions where evaporation surpasses precipitation, however these extreme microbial communities are poorly characterized. Many oligosaline lakes, in contrast to freshwater ones, experience annual blooms of haptophyte algae that generate valuable alkenone biomarker records that can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction. These haptophyte algae are globally important, and globally distributed, aquatic phototrophs yet their presence in microbial molecular surveys is scarce. To target haptophytes in a molecular survey, we compared microbial community structure during two haptophyte bloom events in an arctic oligosaline lake, Lake BrayaSo in southwestern Greenland, using high-throughput pyrotag sequencing. Our comparison of two annual bloom events yielded surprisingly low taxon overlap, only 13% for bacterial and 26% for eukaryotic communities, which indicates significant annual variation in the underlying microbial populations. Both the bacterial and eukaryotic communities strongly resembled high-altitude and high latitude freshwater environments. In spite of high alkenone concentrations in the water column, and corresponding high haptophyte rRNA gene copy numbers, haptophyte pyrotag sequences were not the most abundant eukaryotic tag, suggesting that sequencing biases obscured relative abundance data. With over 170 haptophyte tag sequences, we observed only one haptophyte algal Operational Taxonomic Unit, a prerequisite for accurate paleoclimate reconstruction from the lake sediments. Our study is the first to examine microbial diversity in a Greenland lake using next generation sequencing and the first to target an extreme haptophyte bloom event. Our results provide a context for future explorations of aquatic ecology in the warming arctic.																				1664-302X					2012	3								415	10.3389/fmicb.2012.00415	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00415								23335919					WOS:000208863600416

Natural emissions of CO2 from the geosphere and their bearing on the geological storage of carbon dioxide	ENERGY												Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Although leakage from monitored CO2 injection sites has been minimal to non-existent, experience from the natural gas storage industry suggests that, if it becomes a widely deployed technology, leaks may be expected from some storage sites. Natural occurrences of CO2 in the geosphere, some of which have been exploited, provide insights into the types of emissions that might be expected from anthropogenic CO2 storage sites. CO2 emission sites are commonly found in clusters in CO2-prone geological provinces: the most common natural emissions sites in sedimentary basins consist of carbonated springs and mofettes. These represent at worst only a local hazard. In volcanic and hydrothermal provinces, more energetic emissions may occur due to active supply from degassing magma. These include rare, sudden emissions from fissures and craters that have caused fatalities. It is unlikely that such provinces would be considered for CO2 storage Major lake overturn events such as occurred at Lake Nyos in 1986 are considered highly unlikely to occur as a result of CO2 storage, not least because CO2 levels in lake waters can be monitored and remediated. Natural CO2 fields indicate that under favourable conditions CO2 can be retained in the subsurface for millions of years. The main risk from man-made CO2 storage sites that does not have any close analogy in nature is considered to be a well blowout. A blowout that took place at a natural CO2 field provides some indication of the likely hazard. (C) 2006 NERC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate that fluctuations of clay-size particle contribution to the Nile Delta are mainly driven by orbital precession cycle, which controls summer insolation and consequently the African monsoon intensity changes. Our results indicate that - over the last 110,000 years - the proportion of clays coming from Ethiopian Traps fluctuates accordingly to the intensity of the last 5 precession cycles (MIS 5 to MIS 1). However, there is a threshold effect in the transport efficiency during the lowest insolation minima (arid periods), in particular during the MIS3. Several arid events corresponding to the Heinrich Stadial periods are associated with small or negligible clay source changes while chemical weathering proxies, such as delta Li-7, Mg/Ti and K/Ti, vary significantly. This suggests a straightforward control of weathering by hydro-climate changes over centennial to millennial timescales. Our data also suggests a significant but more progressive influence of the temperature decrease between 110kyr and 20kyr. Taken altogether, the observed tight coupling between past climate variations and silicate weathering proxies leads us to conclude that precipitation changes in northeast Africa can impact soil development over a few hundred years only, while the influence of temperature appears more gradual.

J	Ozdemir, S; Yildirim, SO				Ozdemir, Serkan; Yildirim, Sevgi Ozkan			Prediction of Water Level in Lakes by RNN-Based Deep Learning Algorithms to Preserve Sustainability in Changing Climate and Relationship to Microcystin	SUSTAINABILITY												In recent years, intensive water use combined with global climate change has increased fluctuations in freshwater lake levels, hydrological characteristics, water quality, and water ecosystem balance. To provide a sustainable management plan in the long term, deep learning models (DL) can provide fast and reliable predictions of lake water levels (LWLs) in challenging future scenarios. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and four recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms were investigated to predict LWLs that were applied in time series such as one day, five days, ten days, twenty days, one month, two months, and four months ahead. The results show that the performance of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with a prediction of 60 days is in the very good range and outperforms the benchmark, the Naive Method, by 78% and the ANN at the significance level (p < 0.05) with an RMSE = 0.1762 compared to other DL algorithms. The RNN-based DL algorithms show better prediction performance, specifically, for long time horizons, 57.98% for 45 days, 78.55% for 60 days, and 58% for 120 days, and it is better to use a prediction period of at least 20 days with an 18.45% performance increase to take advantage of the gated RNN algorithms for predicting future water levels. Additionally, microcystin concentration was tightly correlated with temperature and was most elevated between 15 and 20 m water depths during the summer months. Evidence on LWL forecasting and microcystin concentrations in the context of climate change could help develop a sustainable water management plan and long-term policy for drinking water lakes.

J	Gao, M; Jiang, XX; Long, DD; Chu, Y				Gao, Min; Jiang, Xiaoxia; Long, Dandan; Chu, Yin			Phosphorus Fractionation in River Water and Sediment of Two Watersheds of Chaohu Basin, China	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A protocol of distributed sampling on water and sediment of two rivers of Chaohu Basin was carried out in different seasons and under different hydrological conditions. Water samples were analyzed for total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved phosphorus (DP), and sediments for TP, organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (IP), NaOH extracting phosphorus (NaOH-P), and HCL extracting phosphorus (HCL-P). The results showed that median concentrations of TP and DP in water were 0.09 and 0.05 mg/L, and 0.11 and 0.05 mg/L, and those of TP in sediment were 458.4 and 989.6 mg/kg, respectively, for Fengle and Zhegao during the non-flood period. IP concentrations in sediment were significantly higher than that of OP. The average percentages of OP, NaOH-P, and HCL-P were 35%, 29%, and 36% and 24%, 35%, and 41%, respectively, for Fengle River and Zhegao during the non-flood period. A high spatial difference was observed for most phosphorus fractions of water and sediment of both rivers due to the local influence. Average levels of all forms of phosphorus in the water and sediment were higher in the spring than in other seasons for both rivers, except for OP in the sediment of Zhegao River, probably indicating the influence of fertilization on phosphorus export. TP and DP in water were much higher in the rising stage of the flood than that during non-flood, while it was not the case in the recession stage, demonstrating the flushing effect during the rising stage of the flood. No significant difference was found in the levels of phosphorus fractions in sediment between flood and non-flood, nor between rising and recessing stages. The sources of phosphorus were mixed and both natural and anthropogenic sources contributed to phosphorus in the water and the sediments of both rivers. With higher levels of phosphorus fractions in water and sediment, Zhegao imposed a greater phosphorus exportation risk to Chaohu Lake than Fengle.

J	Rountree, RA; Juanes, F; Bolgan, M				Rountree, Rodney A.; Juanes, Francis; Bolgan, Marta			Temperate freshwater soundscapes: A cacophony of undescribed biological sounds now threatened by anthropogenic noise	PLOS ONE												The soundscape composition of temperate freshwater habitats is poorly understood. Our goal was to document the occurrence of biological and anthropogenic sounds in freshwater habitats over a large (46,000 km(2)) area along the geographic corridors of five major river systems in North America (Connecticut, Kennebec, Merrimack, Presumpscot, and Saco). The underwater soundscape was sampled in 19 lakes, 17 ponds, 20 rivers and 20 streams, brooks and creeks that were grouped into broad categories (brook/creek, pond/lake, and river). Over 7,000 sounds were measured from 2,750 minutes of recording in 173 locations over a five-week period in the spring of 2008. Sounds were classified into major anthropophony (airplane, boat, traffic, train and other noise) and biophony (fish air movement, also known as air passage, other fish, insect-like, bird, and other biological) categories. The three most significant findings in this study are: 1) freshwater habitats in the New England region of North America contain a diverse array of unidentified biological sounds; 2) fish air movement sounds constitute a previously unrecognized important component of the freshwater soundscape, occurring at more locations (39%) and in equal abundance than other fish sounds; and 3) anthropogenic noises dominate the soundscape accounting for 92% of the soundscape by relative percent time. The high potential for negative impacts of the anthropophony on freshwater soundscapes is suggested by the spectral and temporal overlap of the anthropophony with the biophony, the higher received sound levels of the anthropophony relative to the biophony, and observations of a significant decline in the occurrence, number, percent time, and diversity of the biophony among locations with higher ambient received levels. Our poor understanding of the biophony of freshwater ecosystems, together with an apparent high temporal exposure to anthropogenic noise across all habitats, suggest a critical need for studies aimed at identification of biophonic sound sources and assessment of potential threats from anthropogenic noises.

Genomic Signatures of Freshwater Adaptation in Pacific Herring (Clupea pallasii)	GENES												Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is an essential target of commercial fishing in the North Pacific Ocean. Previous studies have suggested the existence of marine and lake ecological forms of this species within its range. The lake ecological form of herring has a shortened life cycle, spending the winter and spawning in brackish waters near the shoreline without long migrations for feeding; it also has a relatively smaller body size than the marine form. Genetic-based studies have shown that brackish water Pacific herring not only can be distinguished as a separate lake ecological form but possibly has its genetic legacy. Here, as part of an ongoing study, using ddRAD-sequencing data for marine and lake ecological forms from a total of 54 individuals and methods of comparative bioinformatics, we describe genomic signatures of freshwater adaptivity in Pacific herring. In total, 253 genes containing discriminating SNPs were found, and part of those genes was organized into genome clusters, also known as "genomic islands of divergence". Moreover, the Tajima's D test showed that these loci are under directional selection in the lake populations of the Pacific herring. Yet, most discriminating loci between the lake and marine ecological forms of Pacific herring do not intersect (by gene name) with those in other known marine fish species with known freshwater/brackish populations. However, some are associated with the same physiological trait-osmoregulation.

J	Yang, JJ; Gao, H; Glibert, PM; Wang, Y; Tong, MM				Yang, Jingjing; Gao, Han; Glibert, Patricia M.; Wang, Yu; Tong, Mengmeng			Rates of nitrogen uptake by cyanobacterially-dominated assemblages in Lake Taihu, China, during late summer	HARMFUL ALGAE												Lake Taihu has suffered an increasing number of cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) over the past three decades, bringing about formidable ecological and economical losses. Efforts to control phosphate (P) and/or nitrogen (N) have been applied to mitigate these blooms, but there has been much less attention paid to N and its different forms on the ecology of the blooms. Therefore, kinetic and nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted to assess N uptake rates under differing conditions, and to examine effects of changes in N forms (NH4+, NO3- and urea) and P availability on phytoplankton community physiology. In 2014 these experiments involved mesocosm enrichments; in 2015 these experiments were conducted over a diurnal period. Both involved measurements of short-term N uptake. The kinetic results showed that the utilization of NH4+, NO3- and urea by Microcystis-dominated communities was not efficient at low ambient substrate concentrations. Maximum uptake rates by these phytoplanlcton was achieved on NH4+ and these rates were significantly higher than those on NO3- or urea with or without nutrient pretreatment. Moreover in the presence of PO43- enrichment, the maximal uptake velocity of NH4 substantially increased without evidence of saturation. High amounts of NH4+ may have inhibited or repressed the uptake of NO3- at certain times in these studies. In the diurnal study, dissolved inorganic carbon and pH changed substantially throughout the day. The resulting high pH altered N and P in ways that may help to sustain nutrient cycling for the blooms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Density dependence and density independence in the demography and dispersal of pike over four decades	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Quantifying the effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors in demographic and dispersal processes remains a major challenge in population ecology. Based on unique long-term capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data (1949-2000) on pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere, United Kingdom, we provide estimates of density-dependent and density-independent effects, under the influence of individual size and sex, on natural survival, fishing mortality, and dispersal. Because survival is expected to be related to the individual growth process, we also explore the degree of parallelism between the two processes by applying the best-supported survival model structure to individual growth data. The CMR data were analyzed using sex- and age-structured multistate models (two lake basins: north and south) assuming no seasonal variation in survival and dispersal. Total survival and dispersal probabilities were insensitive to this assumption, and capture probability was shown to be robust to assumptions about intra-annual variation in survival and dispersal. The analyses revealed that large pike (> 55 cm) displayed marked basin-specific differences in survival and dispersal responses to the abundance of conspecifics in which pike from the south basin show high density dependence in survival and a low degree of density dependence in dispersal, whereas the opposite was found for those of the north basin. Both large- and small-pike dispersals were found to be dependent upon the between-basin gradient in perch (Perca fluviatilis, the main prey) abundance, but most so for north-to-south dispersal. The strength and pattern of density-dependent mortality in small pike was influenced by temperature in a peculiar way: at low summer temperatures survival was lowest at high small-pike abundances and low perch abundances; at low temperatures, survival was lowest at high small-pike abundances and high perch abundances. Analyses of individual small-pike growth trajectories showed a similar modulation of the positive perch abundance effect on growth rate when temperature increases. The growth analysis also indicated that cannibalism may be biased in favor of rapidly growing individuals or at least increased growth rate for the surviving individuals. Altogether, this study provides evidence of a complex interplay between density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting survival, dispersal, and individual growth of an aquatic top predator.

Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting as a Wireless Sensor Node Power Source	ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SMART STRUCTURES AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS 2010, PTS 1 AND 2	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Active and Passive Smart Structures and Integrated Systems	MAR 08-11, 2010	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers				Size and power requirements of wireless sensor nodes are gradually decreasing and this has allowed data collection across a range of spatial and temporal ranges. These nodes have power requirements that often necessitate batteries as an energy source. As the power requirements decrease for these sensors, alternative energy sources become more attractive. One such technology is thermal energy harvesting. Thermal energy harvesting requires a differential temperature between a heat source and a cool sink. As heat energy flows from source to the sink, energy can be harvested and utilized to power sensor nodes. By exploiting the temperature difference between a sun-warmed plate and a heat sink immersed in water, electrical energy can be harvested. The proposed concept utilizes a thermoelectric device to convert solar energy into electrical power. Initial experiments were carried out at the CSIRO Energy Centre for a variety of winter time intervals in 2009, with peak power outputs in the order of 50mW. Results indicate such a system could power a wireless sensor node continuously at ocean, lake and river water interfaces. We are presently in the process of evaluating the concept by powering a CSIRO Fleck T wireless node to transmit water temperature and battery voltage data.					; Davidson, Josh/F-1772-2018; Knight, Chris/D-2645-2011	Knight, Chris/0000-0003-4375-0218; Davidson, Josh/0000-0001-5966-4272; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-8058-3				2010	7643								76431E	10.1117/12.847765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.847765													WOS:000285623500039

Some of these water bodies, however, experience major ecological problems. One of the problem areas is the former Volkerak estuary that was turned into,a freshwater lake in 1987. From the early 1990s onward, toxic Microcystis blooms dominate the phytoplankton of the lake every summer. Two management strategies have been suggested to suppress these harmful algal blooms: flushing the lake with fresh water or reintroducing saline water into the lake. This study aims at an advance assessment of these strategies through the development of a mechanistic model of the population dynamics of Microcystis. To calibrate the model, we monitored the benthic and pelagic Microcystis populations in the lake during two years. Field samples of Microcystis were incubated in the laboratory to estimate growth and mortality rates as functions of light, temperature, and salinity. Recruitment and sedimentation rates were measured in the lake, using traps, to quantify benthic-pelagic coupling, of the Microcystis populations. The model predicts that flushing with fresh water will suppress Microcystis blooms when the current flushing rate is sufficiently increased. Furthermore, the inlet of saline water will suppress Microcystis blooms for salinities exceeding 14 g/L. Both management options are technically feasible. Our study illustrates that quantitative ecological knowledge can be a helpful tool guiding large-scale water management.

Climate-mediated nitrogen and carbon dynamics in a tropical watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate variability affects the capacity of the biosphere to assimilate and store important elements, such as nitrogen and carbon. Here we present biogeochemical evidence from the sediments of tropical Lake Titicaca indicating that large hydrologic changes in response to global glacial cycles during the Quaternary were accompanied by major shifts in ecosystem state. During prolonged glacial intervals, lake level was high and the lake was in a stable nitrogen-limited state. In contrast, during warm dry interglacials lake level fell and rates of nitrogen concentrations increased by a factor of 4-12, resulting in a fivefold to 24-fold increase in organic carbon concentrations in the sediments due to increased primary productivity. Observed periods of increased primary productivity were also associated with an apparent increase in denitrification. However, the net accumulation of nitrogen during interglacial intervals indicates that increased nitrogen supply exceeded nitrogen losses due to denitrification, thereby causing increases in primary productivity. Although primary productivity in tropical ecosystems, especially freshwater ecosystems, tends to be nitrogen limited, our results indicate that climate variability may lead to changes in nitrogen availability and thus changes in primary productivity. Therefore some tropical ecosystems may shift between a stable state of nitrogen limitation and a stable state of nitrogen saturation in response to varying climatic conditions.

J	Hunt, RJ; Matveev, VF				Hunt, RJ; Matveev, VF			The effects of nutrients and zooplankton community structure on phytoplankton growth in a subtropical Australian reservoir: An enclosure study	LIMNOLOGICA												Patterns of zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions in Subtropical lakes of the Southern Hemisphere may deviate from those established for north-temperate lakes. We tested the responses of phytoplankton growth to different community structures of zooplankton and nutrient enrichment in a Subtropical Australian reservoir for the prediction of potential outcomes of lake biomanipulation. Two zooplankton communities were created in lake enclosures over 4 weeks: a rotifer-dominated community developed in the presence of planktivorous fish (Hypseleotris spp,) and a Ceriodaphnia-dominated community developed in the absence of fish. Biomass gradients of both communities were established in 20 L containers and several separate containers received no additions (controls) or were enriched with nitrogen and/or phosphorus. The growth rate of total phytoplankton significantly increased in response to nutrient enrichment, indicating nutrient limitation. Most phytoplankton taxa were not markedly affected by grazing or either zooplankton community. However, both communities had significant stimulatory effects on the growth of inedible chlorophytes. The ability of zooplankton grazing to negatively affect phytoplankton growth during the summer was counteracted regardless of zooplankton community structure, possibly by nutrients regenerated by zooplankton. We hypothesise that in the subtropical system studied, changes in food web nutrient recycling may be more important for the outcome of biomanipulation than grazing impacts. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

New Insights into Feral Burro Diet Using a Non-Invasive Sampling and Plant DNA Metabarcoding Approach	ANIMALS												Ungulates play a large role in shaping ecosystems and communities by influencing plant composition, structure, and productivity. We investigated the summer diets of feral burros in two ecosystems in which they are found in the United States: a subtropical desert in Arizona and a temperate juniper shrubland in Utah. Between 24 June and 16 July of 2019, we gathered 50 burro fecal samples from each location and used plant DNA metabarcoding to determine the burros' diets. We found that during our sampling period the burros in the Sonoran Desert consumed a higher proportion of woody browse and had a narrower dietary niche breadth and lower degree of diet diversity compared to the burros in the juniper shrubland ecosystem, where the burros consumed higher proportions of graminoids and forbs and had a higher diet diversity index and broader dietary niche breadth. The burros in the Sonoran Desert relied primarily on Prosopis spp. (mesquite) and Poaceae grasses, whereas the burros in the juniper shrubland relied on a wider variety of forb and grass species, likely due to the greater variability in the forage species temporally and spatially available in that temperate ecosystem. We found that feral burros are highly adaptable with respect to diet and appear to be employing a mixed feeding strategy, similar to their ancestor, the African wild ass, to meet their nutritional needs in whichever ecosystem they are found.

Inactive and relict rock glaciers of the Deboullie Lakes Ecological Reserve, northern Maine, USA	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Lobate talus slopes in the Deboullie Lakes Ecological Reserve (DLER) of northern Maine exhibit parabolic profiles characteristic of inactive and relict talus-derived rock glaciers. Vegetated rock glacier Surfaces Suggest that the landforms are no longer active, and lobes comprising two DLER rock glaciers document periods of past growth. Observations of perennial subsurface ice are supported by datalogger temperature measurements, indicating that sporadic permafrost exists throughout the DLER. We compare the DLER rock glaciers, along with similar features elsewhere in New England and adjacent Quebec, to the modern alpine permafrost distribution. Results indicate that a mean annual temperature cooling of similar to 6 degrees C is required to promote active rock glacier growth. Ages of plant remains recovered from the basal sediments of a local pond constrain deglaciation to before 11 320 C-14 a BP, and core stratigraphy and organic content reveal that a periglacial environment persisted during the early postglacial era. Thus, we hypothesise that the DLER rock glaciers were active during Lateglacial time despite the lack of glacier activity in the region. We take this to suggest that north-eastern US rock glaciers formed in response to mean annual temperatures skewed towards the frigid winters of the Younger Dryas chronozone.

J	Gruger, E; Thulin, B				Gruger, E; Thulin, B			First results of biostratigraphical investigations of Lago D'Averno near Naples relating to the period 800 BC-800 AD	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Remains of diatoms, molluscs, ostracods, foraminifera and pollen exines preserved in the sediments of Lago d'Averno, a volcanic lake in the Phlegrean Fields west of Naples, allowed us to reconstruct the changes in the ecological conditions of the lake and of the vegetation around it for the period from 800 BC to 800 AD. Lago d'Averno was at first a freshwater lake, temporarily influenced by volcanic springs. Salinity increased slowly during Greek times as a result of subsidence of the surrounding land. Saline conditions developed only after the lake was connected with the sea by a canal, when Portus Julius was built in 37 BC. The first post-Roman period of uplift ended with a short freshwater phase during the 7th century after Christ. Deciduous oakwoods around the lake was transformed into a forest of evergreen oaks in Creek times and thrived there - apparently almost uninfluenced by man - until it was felled, when the Avernus was incorporated into the new Roman harbour in 37 BC, to construct a shipyard and other military buildings there. Land-use was never more intense than during Roman times and weakest in Creek and Early Roman times, when the Avernus was considered a holy place, the entrance to the underworld.

J	Jaume, D; Boxshall, GA				Jaume, D.; Boxshall, G. A.			Global diversity of cumaceans & tanaidaceans (Crustacea&COLFAML; Cumacea & Tanaidacea) in freshwater	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Cumacea and Tanaidacea are marginal groups in continental waters. Although many euryhaline species from both groups are found in estuaries and coastal lagoons, most occur only temporarily in non-marine habitats, appearing unable to form stable populations there. A total of 21 genuinely non-marine cumaceans are known, mostly concentrated in the Ponto-Caspian region, and only four tanaids have been reported from non-marine environments. Most non-marine cumaceans (19 species) belong in the Pseudocumatidae and appear restricted to the Caspian Sea (with salinity up to 13 parts per thousand) and its peripheral fluvial basins, including the northern, lower salinity zones of the Black Sea (Sea of Azov). There are nine Ponto-Caspian genera, all endemic to the region. Only two other taxa (in the family Nannastacidae) occur in areas free of any marine-water influence, in river basins in North and South America. Both seem able to survive in waters of raised salinity of the lower reaches of these fluvial systems; but neither has been recorded in full salinity marine environments. The only non-marine tanaidacean thus far known lives in a slightly brackish inland spring in Northern Australia. The genus includes a second species, from a brackish-water lake at the Bismarck Archipelago, tentatively included here as non-marine also. Two additional species of tanaidaceans have been reported from non-marine habitats but both also occur in the sea.					; Jaume, Damia/P-5559-2014	Boxshall, Geoffrey/0000-0001-8170-7734; Jaume, Damia/0000-0002-1857-3005													0018-8158					JAN	2008	595						225	230		10.1007/s10750-007-9018-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9018-0													WOS:000252253300026
J	Irmak, S; Haman, DZ				Irmak, S; Haman, DZ			Evaluation of five methods for estimating class A pan evaporation in a humid climate	HORTTECHNOLOGY												Evaporation pans continue to be used extensively throughout the world to measure free-surface water evaporation (E-pan) and to estimate evapotranspiration for irrigation scheduling and water management for agronomic and horticultural crops. Epan is also being used extensively to estimate evaporation rates from lakes, wetlands, rivers, reservoirs, and other water bodies for management of wildlife and ecological habitat. A reliable method is needed to estimate missing daily E-pan data. Determination of a reliable method for the estimation of E-pan would also be useful in modeling of crop growth, and hydrological and ecological systems. Five methods [Penman (Penman, 1948), Kohler-Nordenson-Fox (KNF) (Kohler et al., 1955), Christiansen (Christiansen, 1968), Priestley-Taylor (PT) (Priestley and Taylor, 1972), and Linacre (Linacre, 1977)] for estimating E-pan were compared with the historical (23-year) measured daily values to determine the success of accurate and consistent E-pan estimations under humid climatic conditions in Florida. The root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the criteria to judge the accuracy and reliability of a given method. An RMSE value of <0.5 mm.d(-1) (0.02 inches/d) between the measured and estimated E-pan was considered as an acceptable error for daily estimations. The standard deviation (SD) values, and percent error (%E) between the estimated and measured values were also considered in the performance evaluations. Performance evaluations of the E-pan estimates of the methods were made on a daily, monthly, and annual basis. Results indicated that the KNF method provided the best E-pan estimations. The Linacre method yielded the poorest estimates. The second, third, and fourth best methods were the Penman, PT, and Christiansen, respectively. The RMSE and SD Of Epan estimates were lowest when using KNF method. The mean value of the %E of daily, monthly, and annual estimations were 27%, 27%, and 26% for Christiansen; 6%, 6%, and 4% for KNF; 33%, 32%, and 26% for Linacre; 24%, 24%, and 21% for PT; and 19'/.' 17%, and 11% for Penman methods, respectively. The weekly, monthly, and annual total of E-pan estimates from KNF method were also compared to the measured values of the two selected years of data (1981 and 1983). The annual rainfall totals were significantly lower than the 23-year mean in 1981, and higher in 1983. The %Es of weekly, monthly, and annual total E-pan estimates were 9%, 9%, and -1% in 1981; and 11%, 5%, and 4% in 1983, respectively. The KNF method underestimated Epan in 1981 (dry year) and the underestimations were higher in summer months. The underestimations in a dry year, especially in summer months, might be due to the fact that the sensible heat advection is not effectively accounted for in the KNF equation causing underestimations of E-pan. Overall results indicated that the KNF method should be the first choice, among the methods tested, for estimating daily E-pan for irrigation scheduling and for estimating the missing E-pan data in humid areas.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				JUL-SEP	2003	13	3					500	508		10.21273/HORTTECH.13.3.0500	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.13.3.0500													WOS:000183746500023
J	Snowball, I; Sandgren, P; Petterson, G				Snowball, I; Sandgren, P; Petterson, G			The mineral magnetic properties of an annually laminated Holocene lake-sediment sequence in northern Sweden	HOLOCENE												Detailed mineral magnetic measurements were conducted on a 9000-year varved lake sediment sequence in northern Sweden (Lake Sarsjon). The results demonstrate that the paramagnetic susceptibility reflects the concentration of detrital minerogenic material in the lake sediments, which is controlled to a large extent by tie intensity of the spring snow melt. In contrast, the concentration of ferrimagnetic magnetite (reflected by initial magnetic susceptibility and magnetic hysteresis parameters) is positively correlated to the concentration of organic carbon, which is most likely of an autochthonous origin. This magnetite has magnetic properties that are characteristic of stable single-domain magnetite grains produced by magnetotactic bacteria. The paramagnetic susceptibility record clearly points to a climatic excursion in the early Holocene between 6300 +/- 174 Be and 5700 +/- 167 Be, which can be correlated to an delta(18)O excursion (a cold event) in the Greenland ice cores and lake sediments in southern Germany, and also to a short period of increased glacial activity in Scandinavia. The middle Holocene (4000-1760 Be) is characterized by sediment with a low concentration of detrital minerals and a high organic carbon content, whereas the late Holocene (1760 BC-AD 1918) is marked by more frequent and intense periods of detrital sedimentation.

Highly organic, diatomaceous muds provide evidence for shifts in wind intensity and stratification within an early Holocene wet phase. Lake level variations within this period may have shifted due to tectonic lowering of the lake's outlet level. The onset of mid-Holocene aridity, as documented by the appearance of authigenic calcite at 5200 cal yr BP, initiated a period of falling lake levels that culminated in a late Holocene lowstand between 4000 and 2000 cal yr BP. This lowstand is documented by coarse sediments whose fabric and mineralogy depend on the core site. Although different cores yield different ages for this regression, it appears that declining lake levels culminated in a maximum lake lowstand of -14 m. Lake levels then rose rapidly, attaining modern positions by 1700 cal yr BP. This lake level history suggests that although many paleoclimatic changes in Africa are apparently synchronous throughout northern hemispheric Africa, other events may be spatially heterogeneous. These patterns highlight the need for a well-dated network of paleoclimate sites within the African continent. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Differential effects of energy and mass influx on the landscape synchrony of lake ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Interannual variation of 45 annually resolved time series of environmental, limnological, and biotic parameters was quantified (1994-2009) in six lakes within 52 000 km 2 to test the hypothesis that influx of energy (E; as irradiance, heat, wind) varies synchronously among sites and induces temporal coherence in lakes and their food webs, whereas influx of mass (m; as water, solutes, particles) reduces synchrony because local catchments uniquely modify hydrologic inputs. Overall, 82% of parameters exhibited significant (P < 0.05) synchrony (S) estimated as mean pair-wise correlation of Z-transformed time series. Influx of E as atmospheric heat and irradiance was both more highly synchronous and less temporally variable (months-to-decades) than influx of m as summer precipitation, snow, or river discharge. Similarly, S of limnological parameters varied from 0.08 to 0.85, with variables known to be regulated by E influx (ice melt, gas solubility) up to twofold more coherent than those regulated by m inputs (organic solutes). Pairs of variables linked by simple direct mechanisms exhibited similar S values (air temperature and ice melt, nutrients and algae), whereas the coherence of other parameters (water temperature, mixing) was intermediate to that of multiple regulatory agents. Overall, aggregate measures of plankton density varied more coherently among lakes than did constituent taxa. These findings suggest that environmental variability is transmitted to most levels of aquatic ecosystems, but that the precise effects depend on whether E or m fluxes predominate, the coherence of each forcing mechanism, and the strength of linkages between exogenous forcing and lake response.

J	Gelda, RK; Effler, SW; O'Donnell, SM				Gelda, RK; Effler, SW; O'Donnell, SM			Probabilistic model of ammonia and toxicity status for urban lake	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE												The development of a probabilistic modeling framework to conduct a priori simulations (forecasts) of the concentration of total ammonia (T-NH3) and status with respect to toxicity standards and criteria is documented for ammonia-polluted Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, N.Y. This framework utilizes a previously tested mass balance nitrogen model, long-term (27 year) simulations, and the Monte Carlo technique. Variability is accommodated, based on long-term records, for several parameters and forcing conditions, including (1) tributary runoff, (2) in-lake vertical mixing, (3) in-lake rate of nitrification, (4) T-NH3 concentration in the effluent of a wastewater-treatment plant, (5) lake pH, and (6) lake temperature. The probabilistic framework per-formed well in simulating the broad variations in T-NH3 concentrations observed in the lake over a 6-year period (1989-1994). The major sources of the observed interannual variability in the lake's T-NH3 pool are demonstrated to be natural variations in runoff and the irregular occurrence of "nitrification events" during fall mixing. Predictions are presented in the form of frequency distributions of T-NH3 concentrations and violations/exceedances of the standard/criterion, consistent with the format of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency toxicity criteria. Application of the probabilistic model is recommended for the total maximum daily load analysis that will establish the T-NH3 limit for the wastewater-treatment plant effluent.

J	Flor-Arnau, N; Sánchez, JC				Flor-Arnau, Nuria; Cambra Sanchez, Jaume			Biodiversity Changes of Charophytes in Lakes and Ponds of the Duero Basin (NW-Spain) over a Twenty-year Period	WETLANDS												With the main goal of investigate the charophyte diversity changes over a period of 20 years, an extensive survey of lakes and ponds of the Duero basin was conducted during the summer of 2005. The results were then compared with those obtained by Alonso & Comelles during a decade (1977-86). Out of the 39 visited water bodies that contained water in 2005, only 14 hosted 10 taxa of charophytes: 8 belonging to the genus Chara and 2 to the genus Nitella. Unlike previous studies, all the water bodies examined in 2005 were highly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. However, no significant differences between sites with or without charophytes were found for any of the studied ecological variables. This suggests that charophytes can adapt to a wide range of habitat conditions, and highlights the need to preserve and maintain the previous heterogeneous nature of the visited water bodies. Moreover, a reduction in charophyte species richness was noted over time. This may have been due to the increasing effect of anthropogenic disturbances, which were mostly related to agricultural and livestock farming activities and alter the water quality of the ecosystems as well as the charophyte flora they harbour.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2015	35	1					159	169		10.1007/s13157-014-0605-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-014-0605-3													WOS:000348235100015

Variations in the Stratification Regime of Onondaga Lake: Patterns, Modeling, and Implications	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Substantial year-to-year variations in the stratification regime of lakes, and coupled features of water quality, can occur in response to natural variations in meteorologic and hydrologic drivers. Variations in the stratification regime of hyposaline Onondaga Lake, NY, are documented for a 19 year period. The lake failed to turnover in spring of two of these years because of combined effects of saline inputs, extended ice cover and subsequent high runoff. A dynamic mechanistic one-dimensional stratification/transport and mass balance model was set-up and validated for the lake for the observed patterns of thermal stratification and salinity (S). The model performed well in matching these features, including the effects of a saline plunging tributary. The annual root mean square error (RMSE) for predictions of temperature (T) ranged from 0.8 to 1.6 degrees C; the overall average was 1.1 degrees C. The normalized (by the annual average S) RMSE for S ranged from 5 to 20%, with an overall average of 9%. Metalimnetic S maxima associated with the plunging tributary were also well predicted. The validated model, with simple oxygen depletion kinetics added, was applied to demonstrate the substantial effects natural interannual variations in the stratification regime have on the timing of the onset of hypolimnetic anoxia and its duration.

Initial studies seemed to limit archaea to various extreme environments. These included habitats at the extreme limits that allow life on earth, in terms of temperature, pH, salinity, and anaerobiosis, which were the homes to hyperthermophiles, extreme (thermo)acidophiles, extreme halophiles. and methanogens. Typical environments from which pure cultures of archaeal species have been isolated include hot springs, hydrothermal vents. solfataras. salt lakes, soda lakes, sewage digesters, and the rumen. Within the past two decades, the use of molecular techniques, including PCR-based amplification of 16S rRNA genes, has allowed a culture-independent assessment of microbial diversity. Remarkably, such techniques have indicated a wide distribution of mostly uncultured archaea in normal habitats, such as ocean waters, lake waters, and soil. This review discusses organisms from the domain Archaea in the context of the environments where they have been isolated or detected. For organizational purposes, the domain has been separated into the traditional groups of methanogens, extreme halophiles, thermoacidophiles, and hyperthermophiles, as well as the uncultured archaea detected by molecular means. Where possible, we have correlated known energy-yielding reactions and carbon Sources of the archaeal types with available data on potential carbon sources and electron donors and acceptors present in the environments. From the broad distribution, metabolic diversity, and sheer numbers of archaea in environments from the extreme to the ordinary, the roles that the Archaea play in the ecosystems have been grossly underestimated and are worthy Of much greater scrutiny.

Quantitative climate reconstructions are performed using pollen-climate transfer functions based on WA-PLS regression. Early Holocene Betula pubescens forests were gradually replaced by Pinus sylvestris at Dalmutladdo (355 m a.s.l.) starting about 7000 cal. yr BP. The local presence of pine woodland at that time is supported by finds of stomata and plant macrofossils and by high pollen accumulation rates. Until about 4000 cal. yr BP the P. sylvestris tree-line was 250-300 m higher than today, suggesting T-jul about 2.0degreesC higher than at present. The later part of the Holocene has a cooler and moister climate and an increasing development of mires and fern-rich vegetation, as shown by increases of Sphagnum and fern spores and the re-establishment of B. pubescens woodland. The reconstructed T-jul from the two sites shows similar trends to previously published data, with T-jul 1-2degreesC warmer between 9500 cal. yr BP and 2000 cal. yr BP T-jul . Maximum T-jul values occur between 8500 and 4500 cal. yr BP, after which there is a gradual decrease in T-jul.					Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Birks, H. John B./C-3103-2008	Birks, H.

J	KONOPKA, A				KONOPKA, A			METALIMNETIC CYANOBACTERIA IN HARD-WATER LAKES - BUOYANCY REGULATION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL-STATE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												During summer stratification, Crooked and Little Crooked Lakes, Indiana, contained phytoplankton dominated by populations of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae that stratified in the metalimnion where photon irradiance was 6% of that at the surface. The gas vacuolate Aphanizomenon filaments from Little Crooked Lake lost buoyance when exposed to irradiances > 100 .mu.mol photons m-2 s-1. If 2 .mu.M KH2PO4 was added to the water samples, however, exposure to irradiances > 200 .mu.mol photons m-2 s-1 was necessary to obtain buoyancy losses. Phosphate also affected the recovery of buoyancy by sinking filaments. Filaments that had lost buoyancy due to incubation in the light recovered it when incubated for 5 h in the dark. Addition of phosphate increased the rate of buoyancy recovery by 50%. The metalimnetic populations had stratified in a zone of relatively low irradiance and inorganic nutrient concentration. The physiological state of the populations was evaluated by determining the kinetic characteristics for phosphate, nitrate, and ammonia uptake and the cellular contents of surplus phosphate and chlorophyll .alpha.. On the basis of the premise that cells limited by a particular element will express a high uptake potential for that element, the metalimnetic populations showed characteristics of organisms not limited by the availability of light, phosphorus, or nitrogen.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1989	34	7					1174	1184		10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1174	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1174													WOS:A1989CH69800003

Changes in the distribution and intensity of suspended particulate matter (SPM) over space and time provide critical insights into the area's ecological dynamics and hydrological functions. Study focus To address the limitations of empirical models in optically complex waters, this study develops a multi-parameter spectral lookup table (LUT) based on the Hydrolight radiative transfer model. The LUT incorporates key optical constituents, including chlorophyll-a (Chla), SPM, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and the backscattering probability of suspended particulate matter (zeta(SPM)). An SPM retrieval algorithm based on spectral similarity matching is proposed. Sensitivity analysis indicates that SPM and zeta(SPM) are the primary drivers of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), while CDOM strongly absorbs in the shortwave region, and Chla exhibits weak, easily masked signals. Validation against Sentinel-3 OLCI reflectance shows strong agreement with simulated spectra (RMSE < 0.027 sr(-)(1) across 15 bands; R-2 > 0.91). New hydrological insights for the region The model was applied to Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery during the ice-free period of 2024 to estimate SPM concentrations in Ebinur Lake. Results consistently showed elevated SPM levels in nearshore areas and a slight decline in model performance during autumn. Retrieved SPM distributions align well with in-situ observations. The proposed model demonstrates high accuracy, physical consistency, and robustness for remote sensing inversion of SPM in turbid inland lakes.

The Effect of Simulated Lepidopteran Ear Feeding Injury on Mycotoxin Accumulation in Grain Corn (Poales: Poaceae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Fusarium graminearum Schwabe (Hypocreales: Nectriaceae) and Fusarium verticillioides (Saccardo) (Hypocreales: Nectriaceae) Nirenberg infection results in accumulation of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZON), and fumonisin (FBs) mycotoxins in infected corn, Zea mays L. Lepidopteran insect feeding may exacerbate fungal infection by providing entry points on the ear resulting in increased mycotoxin contamination of grain. The objective of the current study was to simulate different types and severity levels (extent of injury) of lepidopteran injury to corn ears at different stages of ear development and its effect on mycotoxin accumulation in grain corn. Field experiments were conducted under conditions favorable for F. graminearum development where insect injury was simulated to corn ears and inoculated with F. graminearum. All simulated injury treatments resulted in elevated mycotoxin concentration compared with ears without simulated injury; however, the severity of injury within a treatment had little effect. Injury to kernels on the side of the ear resulted in greater DON and ZON concentration than injury to tip kernels, grazing injury applied at physiological maturity, or when no injury was simulated. Greater FBs was measured when tip kernel injury was simulated at the blister stage or when side kernel injury was simulated at milk and dent stages compared with noninjured ears, silk clipping, tip injury at milk and dent stages, or grazing injury at physiological maturity.The current study confirms that the risk of mycotoxin accumulation in the Great Lakes region is greater in the presence of ear-feeding insect pests and may differ depending on the feeding behavior of pest species.					; Smith, Jocelyn/AAG-8545-2019	Limay-Rios, Victor/0000-0002-0866-3568; Smith, Jocelyn/0000-0001-6747-9798													0022-0493	1938-291X				OCT	2020	113	5					2187	2196		10.1093/jee/toaa174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa174								32865199					WOS:000593071900018

The lake is undergoing numerous ecological changes, including an invasion of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms (WH). The aim of this study was to predict the future fish productivity in Lake Tana by considering the increasing water hyacinth infestation. This was accomplished by analyzing a 12-year fishery-independent time-series data set of Labeobarbus, collected from sites infested and not infested by water hyacinth. The stationarity of the data was investigated using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test. First-order data differencing was applied to solve the non-stationarity data to stationarity. With the same standardized fishing gillnet and the same sites, the CPUE during the dry season decreased from 3,502 grams (3.5 kg/day) in 2010 to 360 grams (0.36 kg) in 2020 at the water hyacinth-infested sites, demonstrating a 90% decrease in the daily catch. A reduction in catch per unit effort (CPUE) is evident at the WH sites in all seasons, and the rate of fall in there was faster than at the non-infested site. Box Jenkin's auto-regressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) modelling predicted that Labeobarbus CPUE will decline by a threefold % by 2032 compared to the current catch. Based on these results, the most suitable model for all the seasons and areas was confirmed to be ARIMA (0, 1, 0) using the lowest value of Akaike Information Criteria (AIC's). The fish production declines with expanding WH infestation will necessitate integrated water hyacinth reduction strategies, closed area and closed spawning seasons, and mesh size regulations to conserve and utilize the resource sustainably. As Labeobarbus is the only examined species in this study, forecasts should be made for other commercially significant fish species in the Lake, such as Oreochromis niloticus and Clarias gariepinus.

Transient climate effects of large impacts on Titan	ICARUS												Titan's thick atmosphere and volatile-rich surface cause it to respond to big impacts in a somewhat Earth-like manner. Here we construct a simple globally-averaged model that tracks the flow of energy through the environment in the weeks, years, and millenia after a big comet strikes Titan. The model Titan is endowed with 1.4 bars of N-2 and 0.07 bars of CH4, methane lakes, a water ice crust, and enough methane underground to saturate the regolith to the surface. We find that a nominal Menrva impact is big enough to raise the surface temperature by similar to 80 K and to double the amount of methane in the atmosphere. The extra methane drizzles out of the atmosphere over hundreds of years. An upper-limit Menrva is just big enough to raise the surface to water's melting point. The putative Hotei impact (a possible 800-1200 km diameter basin, Soderblom et al., 2009) is big enough to raise the surface temperature to 350-400 K. Water rain must fall and global meltwaters might range between 50 m to more than a kilometer deep, depending on the size of the event and how rapidly bedrock ice warms and founders. Global meltwater oceans do not last more than a few decades or centuries at most, but are interesting to consider given Titan's organic wealth. Significant near-surface clathrate formation is possible as Titan cools but faces major kinetic barriers. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Previous research has estimated the influence of TCC on the outflow temperature, but its effect on the thermal structure of a reservoir area is unknown, which is crucial to the reservoir ecology. For this purpose, taking the Sanbanxi Reservoir as a case study, a 2-D hydrodynamic and temperature model covering the whole reservoir was built and calibrated to simulate the flow and temperature fields under different TCC scenarios, and the change rules of thermal stability and outflow temperature are obtained. When the water-retaining proportion (P-r) of bottom TCC increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously decreases, while the thermal stability first increases and later decreases. The maximum thermal stability exists at P-r = 62.5%; it goes against water quality improvement and should be avoided in practice. A bottom-TCC with P-r > 80% is practical for deep reservoirs such as Sanbanxi Reservoir to decrease the temperature difference between inflow and outflow without the increase of thermal stability. In terms of top-TCC, as P-r increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously increases and thermal stability decreases. The top-TCCs are recommended when a smaller thermal stability is more preferentially considered than outflow temperature, or a cool outflow in the summer is required for downstream coldwater fishes. In addition, the TCC cannot decrease or increase the outflow temperature all of the time throughout the whole year, and it primarily changes the phase and variation range of the outflow temperature. This study quantitatively estimates the potential effect of TCCs on the thermal structure and water environment management and provides a theoretical basis for the application of TCC.

Mapping aquifer geometry using electrical resistivity tomography: a case study from Sanliurfa, south-eastern Turkey	NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS												A shallow aquifer system was investigated with 2D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to determine the hydrogeological setting of the Balikli Lake region, Sanliurfa, Turkey. Many spring waters are found in the study area where groundwater flow paths merge and reach the surface. A recreation complex was planned near the Balikli Lake by the Municipality of Sanliurfa. Therefore, an ERT survey was carried out to reveal the subsurface characterization, particularly to investigate the possible shallow aquifer system beneath the recreation area. Consequently, 2D resistivity data along thirteen profiles were acquired in the study area and the data were inverted by a tomographic inversion technique. The conductive layers in the ERT results indicated a shallow aquifer zone probably related to a karstic environment. The high conductivity observed in this layer might be caused by pollution resulting from the industrial and domestic wastes of the residential areas. The high resistive bottom layer was considered to be the basement in the study area. The geometry of the shallow aquifer environment was confirmed by slicing maps obtained from the ERT data. To build the conceptual geological model, a 2D forward resistivity modelling study was also achieved after the inversion studies. The inversion parameters and borehole result underlie the background of the forward model. Field and synthetic data were compared to each other and tested in means of calculation of the misfits to determine the reliability of these models.					; Drahor, Mahmut/AAC-4019-2019; Berge, Meric/P-1745-2019; Kurtulmus, Tevfik/P-9186-2019; Göktürkler, Gökhan/B-7787-2018; Gokturkler, Gokhan/B-7787-2018	Berge, Meric Aziz/0000-0001-5529-2256; Kurtulmus, Ozgur/0000-0002-3602-8393; Gokturkler, Gokhan/0000-0002-2842-0766													1569-4445					FEB	2011	9	1					55	66		10.3997/1873-0604.2010052	http://dx.doi.org/10.3997/1873-0604.2010052													WOS:000287461300005
J	Campbell, CE				Campbell, CE			Rainfall events and downstream drift of microcrustacean zooplankton in a Newfoundland boreal stream	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												While rainfall events may lead to flushing of zooplankton from lakes, with implications for stream productivity near lake outlets, consideration also needs to be given to zooplankton transported farther downstream. To evaluate such downstream transport, daytime invertebrate drift, stream discharge, and rainfall events were monitored over 4 summers in Cook's Brook, Newfoundland, at a downstream site 1.0 km below the outlet of Big Cook's Pond and an upstream site 1.0 km upstream of the pond. Microcrustacean zooplankton were abundant in some downstream samples; high percent zooplankton abundance (87-94%) corresponded to the highest total invertebrate drift densities. Percent zooplankton in downstream drift was strongly correlated with recent rainfall (r(s) = 0.815, p = 0.025) and stream discharge (rs = 0.964, p = 0.001). The majority of microcrustaceans in the drift were planktonic cladocerans and copepods, the species composition being similar to that in Big Cook's Pond. No zooplankton were ever collected from the upstream site. Ephemeroptera, Diptera, Trichoptera, and Ostracoda were abundant in most drift samples. Zooplankton drift (mean = 0.17 individuals/m(3)) in Cook's Brook appears to be catastrophic drift, with high precipitation rates and resultant increased flushing rate in Big Cook's Pond leading to "washout" of microcrustaceans 1 km downstream.

J	ATKINSON, JF; LIN, GQ; JOSHI, M				ATKINSON, JF; LIN, GQ; JOSHI, M			PHYSICAL MODEL OF NIAGARA RIVER DISCHARGE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Development of a physical model study for the Niagara River discharge into Lake Ontario is described. The model is designed on the basis of (distorted) Froude and Rossby similarity and the results demonstrate clearly the effects of rotation on the flow. Important features of the plume are shown to be reproduced by the model, including its anticyclonic (right-turning) flow and the subsequent formation of a near-shore current along the southern coastline. A scaling analysis of the integrated longitudinal momentum equation is suggested as a framework for analyzing this type of flow. This analysis considers three regions of the flow: (1) a near-field, where inertial forces are balanced by pressure and bottom drag; (2) an intermediate-field where the balance is between inertia and buoyancy; and (3) afar-field characterized by nearly geostrophic flow (balance between buoyancy and rotation). This scheme is then tested against conditions characteristic of the Niagara River discharge during spring flows and also with observations from the physical model tests, showing reasonable agreement. One particular result of interest is that the distance at which rotation starts to tum the flow scales approximately with the internal Rossby radius. Results of the study help to distinguish between the relative effects of buoyancy and rotation.																			0380-1330						1994	20	3					583	589		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71174-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71174-6													WOS:A1994PH09200010

Therefore, it is important to understand past variations in glacier activity in the region to assess their possible response to ongoing climatic warming. Here, we present the results of analyses of grain size, total organic carbon, pollen ratio (Artemisia to Chenopodiaceae) and the element content of a 435 cm-long sediment core from proglacial lake Buruo Co on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that the Buruo Co catchment experienced relatively warm and humid conditions during 5.2-4.0 cal kyr BP, during which retreating glaciers released large amounts of freshwater. Precipitation was also abundant during this interval as a result of the relatively strong Indian Summer Monsoon and weaker Westerlies and thus the lake level was high. During 4.0-1.3 cal kyr BP, the Westerlies were gradually enhanced and the climate became colder and drier; in response, the glaciers advanced and the lake level decreased. During 1.3-0 cal kyr BP, under relatively cold conditions, a large volume of glacial ice was maintained; nevertheless, under the Westerlies influence, the lake level rose. Four episodes of glacial advance are detected: at 3.6-3.4, 3.2-2.3, 1.9-1.7 and 0.4-0.1 cal kyr BP. These episodes correspond well with Bond events in the North Atlantic, implying that climate change and glacial activity at Buruo Co were largely driven by variations in Northern Hemisphere insolation and by climatic oscillations in the North Atlantic region, via the influence of the Westerlies.

ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												Due to discharge from acid sulfate (a.s.) soils, watercourses and coastal areas in the Gulf of Bothnia are periodically heavily acidified with high concentrations of potentially toxic metals. Data on water quality from 2005 to 2014 in an embanked lake, an estuary of four rivers in western Finland, showed repeated events with acidic water (pH < 5.5) with high concentrations of Al. Size fractionation and species modeling of Al showed that a significant part of the Al occurred as highly toxic small-size fractions (dissolved < 1 kDa and colloidal 1 kDa-0.45 mu m) as free ions and complexed to sulfate. The larval abundance of the burbot (Lota lota L.) was shown to be sensitive to acidity during the wintertime spawning migration and spawning. Bearing in mind the importance of estuaries of the northern Baltic Sea as spawning and nursery areas of fish, the reoccurring failure in the reproduction of fish may cause a more serious threat for the lake and adjacent coastal fish stocks than the spectacular, but less frequent, mass kills of adult fish. This demonstrates the close relationship between climate, hydrology, water geochemistry and the aquatic coastal ecosystem in areas affected by a.s. soils. As the current forecast of climate chance indicates warmer winters with more continuous runoff, the effects can become even more prominent. This study also shows that the annual larvae abundance of burbot may be used as a bioindicator and an instrument for the fisheries for obtaining more comprehensive knowledge of the ecological effects of acidic metal discharge from a.s. soils.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2020	42	10					3141	3156		10.1007/s10653-020-00550-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00550-1		MAR 2020						32185563					WOS:000520630400002

As a result, self-sustaining populations of muskellunge are diminishing. This study focused on spawning habitat factors that influence egg development and survival and, consequently, the reproductive success of muskellunge. Muskellunge spawning habitat characteristics in lakes with self-sustaining populations were compared with spawning habitat characteristics in lakes that were once self-sustaining but are now maintained by stocking. The hatching success of artificially fertilized eggs was assessed under natural lake conditions. Spawning sites were typically marshy areas in water less than 1 m deep. Characteristics of the spawning habitat influenced successful reproduction. Spawning areas in stocked lakes had low dissolved oxygen (DO; 1.2-5.4 mg/L) at the substrate-water interface, whereas self-sustaining lakes had more variable DO (0.5-9.6 mg/L) with some microhabitats having high DO. Organic carbon content, texture of spawning substrate, and water temperature at the substrate did not differ between self-sustaining lakes and lakes supported by stocking. Fallen logs, stumps, and other wood in spawning areas may increase egg survival. Muskellunge egg survival over natural substrate was low (0.0-1.3%), even in lakes with self-sustaining populations. Col lections of eggs and observations of fry indicated that major mortality occurred after egg deposition but before fry reached nursery habitats several weeks after hatching.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	1998	127	6					995	1005		10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0995:TIOSHO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0995:TIOSHO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078728600011

The Iceland Basin excursion: Age, duration, and excursion field geometry	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The Iceland Basin geomagnetic excursion coincided with the marine isotope stage (MIS) 6/7 boundary. The age and duration of the excursion, at seven North Atlantic sites with sufficient isotope data, are estimated by matching marine isotope stage (MIS) 7a-7c to a calibrated template. Two criteria for defining the excursion, virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) latitudes <0 degrees and <40 degrees N, yield excursion durations of 1-4 and 2-5 kyr, respectively. The midpoints of the excursion are in the 189-192 ka range, with a mean of approximate to 190.2 ka. Although component magnetization directions are generally well defined, rapid changes in field direction during a time of low field intensity are not adequately recorded. During the excursion, VGPs transit southward over Africa and the South Atlantic, reach high southern latitudes at the culmination of the excursion, with partial recovery in relative paleointensity (RPI), and then track northward through the western Pacific. The high southern latitude VGPs, and the recovery in RPI, imply that the Earth's main axial dipole reversed polarity during the excursion, if only for approximate to 1 kyr; implying that excursions can be manifested globally and are important in millennial-scale stratigraphy. VGP clustering in the South Atlantic and NW Pacific roughly coincide with maxima in the vertical-downward component of the modern nondipole (ND) field determined at the Earth's surface, which implies that the ND field became dominant as the geocentric dipole field weakened during the excursion, and also that the ND field configuration is long-lived on multimillennial timescales.																				1525-2027				DEC	2014	15	12					4920	4935		10.1002/2014GC005564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014GC005564													WOS:000348061300019

It is relevant to water quality and sustainable management of closed water bodies through influencing the distribution of dissolved substances, nutrients, microorganisms and plankton. However, the circulation can be influenced by the excessive growth of floating aquatic plants in summer, which may make water quality of closed water bodies become worse. Therefore, knowledge of water movements in closed water bodies in response to winds blowing over the water surface is great of significance in examining and maintaining their water quality in good condition. Aiming at that objective, this research has been done to build a two dimensional, unsteady, laterally averaged model for simulating the wind induced hydrodynamics in closed water bodies. This paper will present primary results regarding to development of a two dimensional numerical model for simulating the wind induced flow in closed water bodies. On the basis of this research, the model can be extended to simulate water quality in these water bodies.

MUDFLOW DISTURBANCE IN LATEST MIOCENE FORESTS IN LEWIS COUNTY, WASHINGTON	PALAIOS												The lower part of the Wilkes Formation (uppermost Miocene) exposed along lower Salmon Creek in Lewis County, Washington, consists of volcaniclastic-dominated deposits. The section contains a stacked series of volcanic runout mudstone beds overlain by more distal runout mudstone beds, interlayered with carbonaceous mudstone and lignite-woodmat beds that are in turn overlain by poorly sorted volcaniclastic mudstone and sandstone. The section contains a record of forested lowlands inundated by volcanic mudflows, followed sequentially by rising water level associated first with deposition in swamp and lake-margin environments and later by deposition in a lake environment. The lakebed sediments contain common siderite concretions of varied form, including coprolite-shaped concretions that are confined to lakebed deposits. The volcanic mudflow deposits are similar to deposits of mudflows-lahars of modern Cascades stratovolcanoes. Two volcanic ash fall beds contained within lignites in the middle of the section yield 40Ar/39Ar radiometric dates. After separation of plagioclase crystals into populations of cloudy appearance (inherited) and clear appearance (newly crystallized), a best age of 6.13 +/- 0.08 Ma is determined for the lower ash bed. Sediments contain abundant and well-preserved pollen and spores that document botanical changes progressing from Nyssa-dominated to Taxodium-dominated to mixed forest assemblages. The existence of Taxodium and other warm-climate taxa in the Wilkes Formation indicates the presence of a wet, warm temperate climate in the Puget lowlands during the latest Miocene.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				MAY-JUN	2013	28	5-6					343	358		10.2110/palo.2012.p12-063r	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2012.p12-063r													WOS:000322856800009

Wetlands and shallow lakes in semi-arid dunefields from South America during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Stabilized and active dunes and sand sheet deposits abound in a small lake-dotted semi-arid region of the Western Pampean Dunefield, Argentina. Here, a multi-scale and multi-proxy study of three sites, across a hydrologic gradient from lakes to a dryland with groundwater levels at more than 25 m depth, analyzes calcareous and ferruginous rhizoliths, calcareous crusts, hypocoatings, pedogenic carbonate and amorphous Mn-oxide precipitates within blowout dunes. These palustrine-related features indicate significantly wetter conditions that allowed the development of shallow lakes and expanding wetlands during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, limited by associated optically stimulated luminescence ages between ca. 14.7 and 11.6 ka. These wetter conditions, also identified in other nearby proxy records, may be associated with a strengthened South American Monsoon System, potentially during the Younger Dryas Chronozone, though other geological, ecological and climatic forcings cannot be ruled out with available data. Such a scenario lacks a modern analogue, since current hydrologic excess, evidenced in the formation of lakes and new rivers, is not observed in the localities which record paleolakes. This study underlines the variable conditions for pronounced hydrologic excess in semi-arid eolian environments in western Argentina with complex ecological, anthropogenic and climatic linkages.

J	Pritchard, HD; Farinotti, D; Colwell, S				Pritchard, Hamish D.; Farinotti, Daniel; Colwell, Steven			Measuring Changes in Snowpack SWE Continuously on a Landscape Scale Using Lake Water Pressure	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The seasonal snowpack is a globally important water resource that is notoriously difficult to measure. Existing instruments make measurements of falling or accumulating snow water equivalent (SWE) that are susceptible to bias, and most represent only a point in the landscape. Furthermore, the global array of SWE sensors is too sparse and too poorly distributed adequately to constrain snow in weather and climate models. We present a new approach to monitoring snowpack SWE from time series of lake water pressure. We tested our method in the lowland Finnish Arctic and in an alpine valley and high-mountain cirque in Switzerland and found that we could measure changes in SWE and their uncertainty through snowfalls with little bias and with an uncertainty comparable to or better than that achievable by other instruments. More importantly, our method inherently senses change over the whole lake surface, an area in this study up to 10.95 km(2), or 274 million times larger than the nearest pluviometer. This large scale makes our measurements directly comparable to the grid cells of weather and climate models. We find, for example, snowfall biases of up to 100% in operational forecast models AROME-Arctic and COSMO-1. Seasonally frozen lakes are widely distributed at high latitudes and are particularly common in mountain ranges, hence our new method is particularly well suited to the widespread, autonomous monitoring of snow-water resources in remote areas that are largely unmonitored today. This is potentially transformative in reducing uncertainty in regional precipitation and runoff in seasonally cold climates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work demonstrates a new method for measuring the water supplied by snowfall on the landscape scale. We find that we can measure accurately and precisely the changing water content of a snowpack by monitoring water pressure in lakes. Monitoring water pressure is relatively simple, cheap, and robust, and pressure changes represent the whole lake surface, which can be an area of many square kilometers. This makes our measurements comparable in size to the grid cells used by weather models, removing one of the major sources of uncertainty when calibrating these models to conventional point measurements of snow. Our method could therefore lead to an improved understanding of regional precipitation and runoff in seasonally cold climates.

Feldspar thermometry in pegmatites: truth and consequences	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												Temperatures of crystallization for all or portions of three thin granitic pegmatite dikes in southern California are derived from feldspar solvus thermometry, with supporting data from the K/Cs ratio of K-feldspar, the extent of Al/Si order in K-feldspar, and the texture of granophyre found along the margins of dikes. Although K-feldspars become perthitic and increasingly ordered toward the centers of dikes, their ratio of K/Cs falls from margin to core along trajectories that reflect fractional crystallization from silicate melt without subsequent interaction with an aqueous solution in an open system. A few sporadic samples that record loss of Cs, and consequent rise in K/Cs, validate the test of fidelity that the perthites generally retain their igneous compositions. Feldspar solvus thermometry from these three dikes indicates that their pegmatite-forming melts crystallized at similar to 375-475 degrees C. Those low temperatures are consistent with the occurrence of granophyric plagioclase-quartz intergrowths along the borders of pegmatites, thick and thin, that arise from thermal quenching of their melts against much cooler host rocks, and hence at much shallower depths than the igneous sources of the pegmatite-forming melts. The temperature profiles are nearly isothermal across the pegmatites, but where variation exists, apparent temperatures are highest along their margins or in their central domains (cores). Plagioclase shows normal fractionation of decreasing An content from margins to center, which mimics the line of descent with cooling down the solidus and solvus surfaces. However, the fractionation trends in the feldspars are attributable to their isothermal crystallization far from the equilibrium of the liquidus at a highly undercooled state, not to crystallization upon cooling on the solidus surface.

J	Izaguirre, I; Allende, L; Marinone, MC				Izaguirre, I; Allende, L; Marinone, MC			Comparative study of the planktonic communities of three lakes of contrasting trophic status at Hope Bay (Antarctic Peninsula)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Three water bodies of contrasting trophic status located at Hope Bay (Antarctic Peninsula) were studied during the summer of 1999, analysing all of their planktonic communities (zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton) and their main limnological features. Important differences associated with their trophic conditions were found among lakes. At one extreme of the gradient, in the most oligotrophic lake (Lake Chico), the nektobenthic copepod Boeckella poppei and the rotifer Philodina gregaria were dominant in the open waters, and copepods presented a single reproductive event (univoltine life cycle); phytoplankton exhibited the lowest densities, dominated by nanoplanktonic Chrysophyceae and picocyanobacteria. In the meso-eutrophic Lake Boeckella, B. poppei, the dominant zooplankter, exhibited a multivoltine life cycle; phytoplankton were mainly represented by nanoplanktonic species of Volvocales, alternating with flagellate Chrysophyceae, and a great abundance of picocyanobacteria. In the hypertrophic Pingui Pond, zooplankters were exclusively represented by bdelloid rotifers and ciliates; phytoplankton samples included some strictly planktonic species (Volvocales), a great proportion of picocyanobacteria and many typically benthic species (oscillatorians and diatoms) due to the shallowness of the water body. Bacterioplankton densities did not show important differences among lakes, but fluctuations, probably associated with a top-down control, were observed in the hypertrophic pond. This paper constitutes the first survey concerning all the planktonic compartments of water bodies of different trophic status at Hope Bay, describing the relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic components to their food webs.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	2003	25	9					1079	1097		10.1093/plankt/25.9.1079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/25.9.1079													WOS:000185148600007

The data was correlated with the in situ physico-chemical parameters, namely temperature, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen. The analysis of the data shows that Lake Naini is a warm monomictic lake [i.e. in a year, the lake is stratified during the summer months (March/April to October/November) and well mixed during the remaining months]. The presence of a centrally submerged ridge inhibits the mixing of deeper waters of the lake's two sub-basins, and they exhibit differential behaviour. The rates of change of isotopic composition of hypolimnion and epilimnion waters of the lake indicate that the water retention time of the lake is very short, and the two have independent inflow components. A few groundwater inflow points to the lake are inferred along the existing fractures, fault planes and dykes. In addition to poor vertical mixing of the lake due to the temperature-induced seasonal stratification, the lake also shows poor horizontal mixing at certain locations of the lake. The lake-groundwater system appears to be a flow-through type. Also, a tritium and water-balance model was developed to estimate the water retention time of well-mixed and hydrologically steady state lakes. The model assumes a piston flow of groundwater contributing to the lake. The developed model was verified for (a) Finger Lakes, New York; (b) Lake Neusiedlersee, Austria; and (c) Blue Lake, Australia based on literature data. The predicted water retention times of the lakes were close to those reported or calculated from the hydrological parameters given in the references. On application of this model to Lake Naini, a water retention time of similar to2 years and age of groundwater contributing to the lake similar to 14 years is obtained.

In a simultaneously managed program with four additional stations from the eastern part (Bregenz Bay) to the western Uberlinger See mainly the differences in horizontal distribution were focussed. It was one aim of these investigations, to get an idea or an indication of a connection between the recently observed eutrophication of the Obersee, and its crustacean communities. Due to the immigration of several species (cyclopids) or genotypes (Daphnia), the communities had changed in genetical structures, in reproduction rates and in predation or grazing impact. Dependent on the specific annual cycles, there resulted an extermination (Heterocope, Diaphanosoma), or a long-term decrease in annual means (Mesocyclops, Cyclops abyssorum) of the ''''old-settled'''' species. A general tendency was seen in an increase of annual averages until the middle of the seventies, and a following decrease of population density of most of the species. The horizontal differences in the species associations were remarkable. The Bregenz Bay showed an own aspect in its crustacean community with high total numbers and in earlier spring development. Most of the newcomers were concentrated in the eastern part of the lake.																			0036-7842					NOV	1988	50	2					136	165		10.1007/BF02538983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538983													WOS:A1988R661500002
J	Dzyuban, AN				Dzyuban, AN			Intensity of the microbiological processes of the methane cycle in different types of Baltic lakes	MICROBIOLOGY												The intensity of the microbiological processes of methane formation (MF) and methane oxidation (MO) was determined in the sediments and water of different types of Baltic lakes. The emission of methane from the lake sediments and methane distribution in the water column of the lakes were studied as functions of the lake productivity and hydrologic conditions. During summers, the intensity of MF in the lake sediments and waters varied from 0.001 to 106 ml CH4/(dm(3) day) and from 0 to 3.2 ml CH4/(1 day), respectively, and the intensity of MO in the sediments and water varied from 0 to 11.2 ml CH4/(dm(3) day) and from 0 to 1.1 ml CH4/(1 day), respectively. The total methane production (MP) in the lakes varied from 15 to 5000 nil CH4(m(2) day). In anoxic waters, the MP comprised 9-18% of the total PM in the lakes. The consumption of organic carbon for methanogenesis varied from 0.03 to 9.7 g/(m(2) day). The role of the methane cycle in the degradation of organic matter in the lakes increased with their productivity.

Nitrogen dynamics and microbial food web structure during a summer cyanobacterial bloom in a subtropical, shallow, well-mixed, eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes	APR 22-26, 2005	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Nitrogen dynamics and microbial food web structure were characterized in subtropical, eutrophic, large (2,338 km(2)), shallow (1.9 m mean depth), and polymictic Lake Taihu (China) in Sept-Oct 2002 during a cyanobacterial bloom. Population growth and industrialization are factors in trophic status deterioration in Lake Taihu. Sites for investigation were selected along a transect from the Liangxihe River discharge into Meiliang Bay to the main lake. Water column nitrogen and microbial food web measurements were combined with sediment-water interface incubations to characterize and identify important processes related to system nitrogen dynamics. Results indicate a gradient from strong phosphorus limitation at the river discharge to nitrogen limitation or co-limitation in the main lake. Denitrification in Meiliang Bay may drive main lake nitrogen limitation by removing excess nitrogen before physical transport to the main lake. Five times higher nutrient mineralization rates in the water column versus sediments indicate that sediment nutrient transformations were not as important as water column processes for fueling primary production. However, sediments provide a site for denitrification, which, along with nitrogen fixation and other processes, can determine available nutrient ratios. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was important, relative to denitrification, only at the river discharge site, and nitrogen fixation was observed only in the main lake. Reflecting nitrogen cycling patterns, microbial food web structure shifted from autotrophic (phytoplankton dominated) at the river discharge to heterotrophic (bacteria dominated) in and near the main lake.

J	Schirmer, J; Dyer, F				Schirmer, Jacki; Dyer, Fiona			A framework to diagnose factors influencing proenvironmental behaviors in water-sensitive urban design	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The ongoing challenge of maintaining and improving the quality of water that leaves urban stormwater systems is often addressed using technical rather than social solutions. The need for investment in often expensive water infrastructure can be reduced through better investing in promoting human behaviors that protect water quality as part of water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) initiatives. Successfully achieving this requires understanding factors that influence adoption of proenvironmental behaviors. We review past studies examining this topic and identify that factors influencing adoption of proenvironmental behaviors relevant to WSUD commonly fall into four domains: proenvironmental values and norms, awareness and knowledge of environmental problems and the actions that can address them, proximity and place-based identity, and life-stage and lifestyle factors. We propose the VAIL (values, awareness, identify, lifestyle) framework, based on these four domains and able to be contextualized to specific water-quality problems and individual communities, to assist in diagnosing factors influencing adoption of proenvironmental behaviors. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework in a case study examining adoption of gardening practices that support water quality in Canberra, Australia. We developed 22 locally relevant VAIL indicators and surveyed 3,334 residents to understand engagement in four water-friendly gardening behaviors that help improve water quality in local lakes. In regression modeling, the indicators explained a significant amount of variance in these behaviors and suggested avenues for supporting greater adoption of these behaviors. Predictor variables across all four VAIL domains were significant, highlighting the importance of a multidomain framework.

The Influence of the MJO on Upstream Precursors to African Easterly Waves	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) produces alternating periods of increased and reduced precipitation and African easterly wave (AEW) activity in West Africa. This study documents the influence of the MJO on the West African monsoon system during boreal summer using reanalysis and brightness temperature fields. MJO-related West African convective anomalies are likely induced by equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves generated in the Indian Ocean and West Pacific by the MJO, which is consistent with previous studies. The initial modulation of tropical African convection occurs upstream of West Africa, near the entrance of the African easterly jet (AEJ). Previous studies have hypothesized that an area to the east of Lake Chad is an initiation region for AEWs. Called the "trigger region" in this study, this area exhibits significant intraseasonal convection and wave activity anomalies prior to the wet and dry MJO phases in the West African monsoon region. In the trigger region, cold tropospheric temperature anomalies and high precipitable water, as well as an eastward extension of the African easterly jet, appear to precede and contribute to the wet MJO phase in West Africa. An anomalous stratiform heating profile is observed in advance of the wet MJO phase with anomalous PV generation maximized at the jet level. The opposite behavior occurs in advance of the dry MJO phase. The moisture budget is examined to provide further insight as to how the MJO modulates and initiates precipitation and AEW variability in this region. In particular, meridional moisture advection anomalies foster moistening in the trigger region in advance of the wet MJO phase across West Africa.

J	CARIGNAN, R; LEAN, DRS				CARIGNAN, R; LEAN, DRS			REGENERATION OF DISSOLVED SUBSTANCES IN A SEASONALLY ANOXIC LAKE - THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROCESSES OCCURRING IN THE WATER COLUMN AND IN THE SEDIMENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the release of inorganic C, CH4, NH4+, PO43-, reactive silica (RSi), Fe, Mn, and Ca from the sediment of a small, mesotrophic, shield lake (Williams Bay, Jacks Lake, Ontario). The diffusion of CH4, SIGMA-CO2, NH4+, and RSi from the sediments, as estimated from pore-water data, increases linearly with depth and sedimentation rate. Release associated with sedimentation rate accounts for 47-84% of the fluxes of these substances to the water column. Regeneration from both the water column and the sediments plays an important role. During summer anoxia, 70% of the hypolimnetic accumulation of NH4+ is accounted for by diffusion from the sediments. This proportion is 31% for SIGMA-CO2, 62% for CH4, 54% for total P (TP), 36% for RSi, 15% for Fe, 12% for Mn, and 5% for Ca. Significant release of Fe, Mn, and PO43- is limited to the deepest part of the basin. Regeneration of PO43- is not well coupled to organic-matter degradation, and undefined anoxic P-immobilization reactions seem to be taking place in the sediments of the littoral and upper hypolimnion. Diagenetic modeling of the sediment pore-water and solid-phase data shows that the layer of sediment involved in nutrient release extends 50-100 cm below the interface. The global recycling of carbon and nitrogen in aquatic systems is attributed to the decomposition of three classes of organic compounds (G0, G1, and G2) that display well-separated first-order decay constants (k congruent-to 40, 0.2, and 0.01 yr-1). Most of G0 appears to be decomposed during its descent in the water column. The longer lived sedimentary fractions (G1 and G2) show marked focusing in the basin, and most of the regeneration is attributable to decomposition of the less reactive fraction G2. The existence of long-lived sedimentary organic-matter fractions is consistent with the observed resilience of sediment catabolism to seasonal or long-term changes in organic matter influx.																			0024-3590					JUN	1991	36	4					683	707		10.4319/lo.1991.36.4.0683	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.4.0683													WOS:A1991GH83900006

Time variant cross correlation to assess residence time of water and implication for hydraulics of a sink-rise karst system	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Transport rates and residence time in the subsurface are critical parameters for understanding water-rock interactions for efficient contaminant remediation. This paper presents a methodology for assessing flow and transit time of water through hydrological systems, with specific applications to karst systems and implication for hydraulics of a conduit system surrounded by a porous and permeable intergranular matrix. A time variant cross-correlation function analysis is applied to bivariate time series that characterize mass transfer, assuming a stationary system using sliding windows of various sizes. We apply the method to 1 year long temperature records in the Santa Fe River (north central Florida) measured at (1) the River Sink, where all the incoming surface water drains into a sinkhole, (2) Sweetwater Lake, where the river resurges into a 500 m long karst window, and (3) the River Rise, where the water discharges from a first-magnitude karst spring. Results are compared with those obtained using specific conductivity. Estimated residence time ranges from less than 1 day during floods to more than 15 days during base flow within the 8000 m flow path between the River Sink and the River Rise. Results are used to characterize geometric, hydraulic, and hydrodynamic properties of this sink-rise system with strong matrix-conduit interactions. These properties are critical to the chemical and physical behavior of surface water-groundwater mixing. Our results also have direct implications for sampling strategies and hydrograph separation of many karst systems with different degrees and types of matrix porosity and permeability.					; Bailly-Comte, Vincent/JEP-3465-2023	Martin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7047-0321; Bailly-Comte, Vincent/0000-0003-2352-1821													0043-1397					MAY 28	2011	47								W05547	10.1029/2010WR009613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR009613													WOS:000291111100007

A 210-cm-deep trench section was collected from the center of the lake. Five accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating results indicate that the studied section encompasses the late Glacial to middle Holocene periods (12.8-5.5 cal ka BP). Vegetation and environmental changes in the Lop Nur region can be divided into three stages and six sub-stages, based on significant changes in the pollen assemblages. Dry conditions and desert steppe or steppe vegetation dominated this region from 12.8 to 11.4 cal ka BP. The climate became warmer and wetter at the beginning of the Holocene, and steppe vegetation replaced the previous flora. Steppe vegetation continued to dominate until the middle Holocene (8.7-6.7 cal ka BP), which had the wettest moisture conditions. Increased winter temperatures from 6.7 to 5.5 cal ka BP triggered more evaporation, causing shrinkage of the lowland wetlands. Climate events such as the Allerod oscillation, the Younger Dryas, and events at 9.4 cal ka BP, 8.4cal ka BP, 7.5 cal ka BP, and 7.0 cal ka BP, were recognized in the Lop Nur section. The evidence indicates that climate oscillations in the Lop Nur area were influenced and controlled by changes in global climate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Backpack electrofishing effort and imperfect detection: Influence on riverine fish inventories and monitoring	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												An increased electrofishing sampling effort will increase detection probabilities of riverine fishes. In this study, a repeat-sampling approach was used in small to medium-sized Ontario (Canada) rivers to estimate: (i) species-specific detection probabilities of freshwater fishes, (ii) the number of sampling events required to confidently detect species, and (iii) the power of timed-search surveys to detect future distribution (or occupancy) declines. Wadeable habitats at 36 sites were sampled with a backpack electrofisher on four separate dates during the summer low-flow period in 2013 and 2014. Forty-two species were collected, including three species of conservation concern (American eel Anguilla rostrata Lacepede, 1802, channel darter Percina copelandi Jordan, 1877, northern sunfish Lepomis peltastes Cope, 1870), and two recreationally important species (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides Lacepede, 1802 and smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu Lacepede, 1802). A hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach was used to estimate detection probabilities and site occupancy for 18 species at four levels of effort: 250, 500, 750 and 1,000s. In all cases, species detection was imperfect. Search effort had a positive effect on estimates of detection probability and site occupancy and the power to detect declines in future distribution. Detection probabilities ranged from 0.11 to 0.66 with an effort of 250s, and 0.27 to 0.92 with an effort of 1,000s. For 13 species, detection and power to detect changes in distribution were significantly improved by increasing sampling effort from 250 to 750s or 1,000s. For the channel darter and northern sunfish, three replicate sampling visits (of 750 or 1,000s duration) are recommended for confident detection.

The overall level of nucleotide diversity was high ( similar to14 %). Great geographical distances between the sites where isolates were collected were consistently associated with high genetic distances. In contrast, a wide range of genetic distances occurred among isolates spread over short geographical distances. There was no evidence of long-range dispersal. RYMV diversity in relation to land area was eight times greater in East Africa than in West/Central Africa. West/Central African isolates with up to 9 % divergence belonged to a monophyletic group, whereas the East African isolates with up to 13 % divergence fell into distantly related groups. In East Africa, each Tanzanian strain had a specific and restricted geographical range, whereas West/Central African strains had large and partially overlapping geographical distributions. Overall, our results suggest an earlier RYMV diversification in East Africa and a later radiation in West/Central Africa. The West African situation was consistent with virus adaptation to savanna, forest and other ecological conditions. In contrast East Africa, as exemplified by the Tanzanian situation, with numerous physical barriers (mountain chains, sea channel, lakes), suggested that RYMV strains resulted from divergence under isolated conditions. For RYMV and for two other viruses, phylogenetic relationships were established between isolates from Madagascar and isolates from the Lake Victoria region.																			0022-1317					MAR	2003	84		3				733	743		10.1099/vir.0.18759-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.18759-0								12604826					WOS:000181237500027

There was no compensation for these relationships with increased bacterial production per cell, but our data showed an increase in production per unit bacterial biomass (273 fmol TdR . 1 mu g C-1. h(-1)). Bacterial production (19.8-422 mg C . m(-2). d(-1)) was correlated with primary production (r = 0.76), and maximum bacterial production coincided with summer cyanobacterial blooms. Water temperature was a dominant factor correlated with bacterial production (r = 0.85) and growth (r = 0.92). Depending upon the factors used to convert the rate of thymidine incorporation to gross carbon production, heterotrophic bacterial production was able to consume an average of 42% (408 mg C . m(-2). d(-1)) to 67% (653 mg C . m(-2). d(-1)) of plankton primary productivity. Based on these calculations, hypertrophic prairie lakes might accumulate autochthonously produced organic carbon, but this conclusion takes no account of benthic bacterial production which could be high in shallow lakes.

J	REIMCHEN, TE				REIMCHEN, TE			SIZE-STRUCTURED MORTALITY IN A THREESPINE STICKLEBACK (GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS) CUTTHROAT TROUT (ONCORHYNCHUS-CLARKI) COMMUNITY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In a 112-ha bog lake on the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, small fish comprised the major element in the diet of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). Despite the presence of juvenile salmon and char in the lake, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was the most common fish in the diet (99.5%). Foraging activity appeared to be more frequent in littoral than in limnetic regions. Mark-recapture methods indicate an average population of 220 trout and 75,000 adult stickleback. Trout consumed an estimated 308,770 stickleback yearly (145 kg) of which 65% were taken during summer. Seventy-three percent of all fish consumed were young of the year and 2% were adults, the latter representing 4% of the adult population in the lake. There was a 75% reduction in total mortality between successive year classes of stickleback (0, 1, 2, 3 +). This consumption curve, which resembles a typical survivorship curve of fish, is a function of the size-structure of the populations and includes interactions between size availability of stickleback, prey-size preferences of the trout, and length frequency distributions of trout. Total weight of stickleback consumed by trout comprised about 40% of that previously calculated for 16 species of avian piscivores in the lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1990	47	6					1194	1205		10.1139/f90-139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-139													WOS:A1990DF53600019

However, our knowledge of cyanobacterial blooms dynamics and driving mechanisms is still limited due to their high spatiotemporal variability. To determine the potential driving mechanisms of cyanobacterial blooms in oligotrophic lakes, we collected a high-frequency depth profile of chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) and synchronous water quality, hydrometeorological data in early spring 2016 in oligotrophic Lake Qiandaohu. The vertical distribution of ChlF exhibited two patterns, "aggregated" and "discrete", using Morisita's index, and the aggregated ChlF presented subsurface chlorophyll maxima during the thermal stratification period. The ChlF concentration was positively correlated with water temperature and negatively correlated with turbidity. Significantly linear relationships were observed between ChlF vertical structure parameters (e.g., Morisita's index, subsurface chlorophyll maxima depth and thickness) and thermal stratification parameters (e.g., mixing layer depth and relative water column stability). After rainstorm floods, the ChlF pattern suddenly change from "aggregated" to "discrete" and a ChlF concentration <1 mu g/L was observed for 7-11 days with a significant increase in the mixing depth layer and turbidity. The results suggest that cyanobacterial blooms are robustly associated with thermal stratification and rainstorm floods in the deep and oligotrophic lake. Thermal stratification boosts surface phytoplankton accumulation by increasing water temperature, enhancing light availability and restricting phytoplankton vertical distribution. Rainstorm floods interrupt the accumulation by disrupting thermal stratification and decreasing the available light. Furthermore, wind speed and air temperature both regulate the phytoplankton dynamics by affecting thermal stratification. Our research quantifies the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics and their relationship between environmental factors, improving our knowledge of the driving mechanisms of cyanobacterial bloom for the protection of drinking water safety and aquatic organism health in lakes.

BIOINDICATION USING DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY OF ALGAE OF THE ALAKOL LAKE, KAZAKHSTAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The aim of present study were to reveal species-indicators of the Alakol Lake communities and assess the water quality with bioindication and statistical methods. Algal communities in the Alakol Lake Natural State Reserve were studied in 21 samples collected during August 2015-2017 summer field trips. Altogether 208 algal species from five taxonomic Divisions were indicators of ten water properties: temperature, oxygenation, organic pollution, salinity, trophic state of the water, and nutrition type of algal species. It was the first experience of the bioindicational approach implementation for ecological assessment of water quality in the Alakol Lake. Diatom species, which are most indicative, strongly prevailed in the three studied areas of the lake. We revealed that algal species can characterize the water of the lake as low alkaline, low saline, temperate, middle oxygenated water with low-to middle organic pollution that comes from Koktuma and Kamyskala areas and decrease from north to south. The lake tropic state and intensity of self-purification are also increase from north to south. Algal communities aremostly represented by periphytonic and benthic autotrophic species. Statistical analysis of species-environment relationships revealed that most of species preferred to survive in communities with complicated structure which formed in low organically polluted waters. Bioindication assess the Alakol Lake as oligotrophic and meso-eutrophic, of Class 2 and 3 of Water Quality with high level of self-purification capacity.

Transient numerical simulations of thermally-driven flow without salinity effects show that mixed convection can explain the upsurge of thermal waters through permeable faults and the high temperature gradient in the Lower Yarmouk Gorge (LYG). It turns out that by including salinity effects, the flow patterns differ from those of a purely thermal regime because heavy brines dampen upward buoyant flow and convective cells. Accordingly, the fault permeability had to be increased to restore a good fit with the measured temperatures. This further supports the hypothesis that the high temperature gradient in the LYG is likely due to fractures or faults in that area. The thermohaline simulations also suggest that the derivatives of relic seawater brines are the major source of salinity. Deep brines leaching salt diapirs cannot reach the surface. However, the presence of local shallower salt bodies below the lake can potentially contribute to the salinity of the western spring and well waters, though in very small amount. This is in agreement with geochemical data according to which the major source of the brines of the Tiberias Basin represents seawater evaporation brines. Besides being of importance for understanding the hydrogeological processes that salinize Lake Tiberias, the presented simulations provide a real-case example illustrating large-scale fluid patterns due to only one source of buoyancy (heat) and those that are additionally coupled to salinity.

Cladoceran remains reveal presence of a keystone size-selective planktivore	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We tested the use of cladoceran remains as a proxy for the presence and life history type of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) from pre-colonial times to present in a group of coastal lakes in southern New England. Alewife are a keystone predator that structure the zooplankton community through strong predation on large-bodied zooplankton species, which releases small zooplankton species, such as Bosmina spp., from competition and predation pressure. In southern New England there are lakes without alewife, lakes with anadromous alewife that only reside in lakes during the summer, and lakes with landlocked alewife that reside in lakes year-round. The entire zooplankton community of these lakes is structured differently based on the presence and type of alewife they contain. We examined differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. from sediment core samples and contemporary zooplankton samples between lakes with different types of alewife. We found that there were significant differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. between lakes with and without alewife. We also used discriminant analysis on the morphology of Bosmina spp. to classify lakes in terms of alewife presence and alewife type. We found that the morphology of Bosmina spp. can serve as a useful proxy for detecting the presence, but not the life history type of alewife from paleoecological and contemporary inferences.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009; Twining, Cornelia/AAS-3939-2020	Twining, Cornelia/0000-0002-4346-8856; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729; 													0921-2728					FEB	2013	49	2					253	266		10.1007/s10933-012-9672-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9672-8													WOS:000313795300010

Experimental assessment of the bioenergetic and behavioural differences between two morphologically distinct populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A common environment experiment was conducted to assess the magnitude of the difference in growth, consumption, activity rate, and spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use between morphologically different populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) originating from two Norwegian lakes. These two lakes contrasted sharply in terms of surface area, depth, elevation, length of the winter period, and fish community structure (presence-absence of brown trout, Salmo trutta). The experimental framework encompassed four littoral enclosures (average volume, 146 m(3)) stocked with char from either of the two populations with duplicated treatments. Chat morphology was quantified with numerical image analysis, food consumption was estimated using caesium analysis ((133)Cs), and activity cost and patterns were determined using video cameras. Char populations were morphologically distinct and reacted differently in growth (1.9-fold difference between populations), food consumption (3-fold difference), and spatial activity patterns (20-fold difference) to the conditions prevailing in the enclosures. The results highlight that functional differences between morphologically distinct char may drive important differences in their bioenergetic and behavioural responses when exposed to similar environmental conditions. Such functional differences should be incorporated when developing habitat or trophic cascade models.					; Boisclair, Daniel/AAS-2345-2020; Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012	Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X; Forseth, Torbjorn/0000-0002-1066-2839; Boisclair, Daniel/0000-0002-4353-9597; 													0706-652X					MAR	2010	67	3					580	595		10.1139/F10-004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F10-004													WOS:000275356400012

Water quality assessment in these areas therefore has to rely on the limited available data, coupled with restricted field sampling. This paper documents the first evaluation of the main geochemical processes and impact of anthropogenic and natural sources of contamination on the groundwater quality of the aquifer system used for domestic and agricultural purposes in Limpopo National Park, Gaza Province, Southern Mozambique. Twenty-five groundwater and surface water samples were collected during two field campaigns, one in October 2016 (the end of the arid period) and the other in March 2017 (the end of the wet period). In the field, the researchers analysed chemical-physical parameters such as temperature, pH and EC. In the laboratory, the major ions (boron, Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+) and anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-, CO32-) were determined, and almost all groundwater samples fall into the brackish water category. The B/Cl ratio and B-11 concentrations were then measured to better understand the origin of these brackish waters. The direct relationship between boron and chlorine and B-11 concentrations above 40 parts per thousand suggests the presence of fossil water in the aquifer. The groundwater in this area was found to be above the limits stated as desirable by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and the World Health Organisation for domestic and irrigation purposes. The suitability of the groundwater for drinking purposes was also evaluated, with the results indicating that it is not suitable. The values of the sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage and electrical conductivity show that most of the groundwater samples are also not suitable for agricultural purposes. However, the surface waters have higher quality for both domestic and irrigation purposes. The water of Massingir Lake turns out to be the most suitable resource for a possible rural development plan for the area.					; Barbieri, Maurizio/E-9260-2012; VITALE, STEFANIA/ISS-9000-2023	Ricolfi, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7101-3309; Barbieri, Maurizio/0000-0002-6595-103X; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2019	26	1					62	77		10.1007/s11356-018-3474-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3474-0								30357673					WOS:000454939400007

The cold lake water (T close to 10 degrees C) is sulphate-dominated, due to absorption and oxidation of H2S (pH 2.1-2.7, Eh 196-260 mV), and Na-enriched (Total Dissolved Solids 0.79 g L-1). The total amount of REE dissolved in the lake ranges from 3.3 to 9.1 ppb. The REE patterns normalized to the local rocks show a Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE) depletion quite constant in the 15 samples. Similar patterns were already found in the acidic sulphate springs of Nevado del Ruiz volcano-hydrothermal system, caused by the precipitation of alunite and jarosite, absorbing LREE and hence removing them from solution. Alunite and jarosite minerals are not oversaturated at chemical-physical conditions within the lake itself, but alunite becomes oversaturated for temperatures above approximate to 100 degrees C, reigning in the underlying hydrothermal system. Water temperatures close to 75 degrees C were found in the northern part of the lake. Coupling the distribution of REE in lake water (LREE depleted) and the saturation indexes, we suggest that the distribution of REE in the lake water is the result of the alunite precipitation in the northern part of the lake and/or in the deeper hydrothermal system. The acidic hydrothermal fluids mobilize the REE with contents up to approximate to 5 orders of magnitude higher than seawater; acidic-hydrothermal systems, such as acidic crater lakes, can hence be considered potential REE "reservoirs".

J	Jonsson, B; Jonsson, N				Jonsson, Bror; Jonsson, Nina			Naturally and hatchery produced European trout Salmo trutta: do their marine survival and dispersal differ?	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												We tested whether marine survival and migration pattern differed between naturally and hatchery produced European trout Salmo trutta of different origins. The hatchery fish were released 150 m above the river estuary of the southwestern, Norwegian River Imsa, the home of the local population. Recaptures were used as proxy for survival. Wild and local hatchery fish survived better than transplanted hatchery stocks. Trout that were 1 year at release survived less well than 2-year olds, and small individuals less well than larger ones. Relative to their body size at release, populations that originated most distant from the River Imsa, the Baltic River EmAyenn and the Norwegian mountain Lake Tunhovd, exhibited the poorest sea survival. At sea, trout chiefly moved less than 240 km from the river of release, but there were significant differences in dispersal among populations. Hatchery-produced River EmAyenn and Lake Tunhovd trout moved farther from the River Imsa than the south Norwegian sea trout populations, and the marine distributions of the former were similar to that of the natural River Imsa trout. Large fish moved farther from the river than smaller ones. Straying to other rivers was low among wild and local hatchery-produced fish, and significantly lower than among most transplanted populations, and River EmAyenn trout in particular. Thus, the River Imsa trout appeared better adapted to survival under the local conditions than non-local trout with consequences for optimal population management.																			1400-0350	1874-7841				APR	2014	18	2					79	87		10.1007/s11852-012-0224-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-012-0224-1													WOS:000335390400002

Microhabitats sampled included various plant species, rocks, and the water column. Densities and percentages of individual species in the microhabitats were used to calculate community coefficients of similarity among and within microhabitats, and to perform ANOVA and SNK tests. Cladoceran communities were more similar within than between microhabitats, indicating there is significant variation in community structure among littoral microhabitats. Densities of some cladoceran species varied significantly among microhabitats. Acroperus harpae, Camptocercus rectirostris, and Pleuroxus procurvus were more abundant on plants than on rocks in the embayment. Chydorus brevilabris and Alona guttata were more abundant on Myriophyllum than Ulothrix in the pond. In Lake Lacawac, A. harpae was more abundant on plants, than rocks, while Alona rustica and C. brevilabris preferred rocks. Bosmina sp. showed significant diel density variation in Lake Lacawac. Also in this system, coexisting species of Alona and Chydorus in the littoral zone showed evidence of density variation among microhabitats. Some species of cladocerans therefore seem to be specialized for certain microhabitats, and these specializations may be the basis for spatial partitioning of resources in multispecific communities of these animals.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1988	4	3					303	313		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665180													WOS:A1988N559000006

We have studied gut content composition of brown trout fry in a temperate area (Galicia, NW Spain) and compared it to the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Small prey such as chironomid larvae and baetid nymphs were the most important food items for newborns, some of them still presenting yolk remnants. However, the positive selection observed for Polycentropodidae and Simuliidae and the rejection of Elmidae and Leuctricidae suggest that other factors apart from size, such as locomotor abilities of fish or accessibility and antipredator behaviour of prey play an important role in feeding behaviour. Additionally, analysis of diet changes on the studied fry suggests a dramatic shift in niche breadth at the moment of complete yolk absorption, which might be related to the improvement of swimming and handling ability of fry for capturing and ingesting prey. The presence of aerial imagoes only in the stomachs of fry with no yolk provides further support to this hypothesis. Planning of restoration works on spawning grounds should then allow enough time for complete recolonization by benthic macroinvertebrates, including first instars, as searching for food in newborns is limited to the nest area due to mobility constraints.

During an initial 47 day enrichment phase, ammonium chloride at different concentrations was added to O2-saturated river water in experimental channels. Compared to a control, the addition of 1.2 mg NH4+-N . l-1 resulted in only slight changes in the species composition of the diatom community. The addition of 5.1 mg NH4+-N . l-1 and more (greater-than-or-equal-to 60 mug NH3-N . l-1) resulted in a decrease in the biomass and a drastic change in the species composition. After the 42 day enrichment period, the diatom species Fragilaria capucina var. vaucheriae, Navicula saprophila, Navicula atomus and Gomphonema parvulum, all of which are known to be tolerant to organic pollution, were found with relative abundances of 44.8%, 35.6%, 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Changes in species composition of the periphytic diatom communities occurred within the first two weeks of the subsequent recovery phase. After a month of recovery, all periphytic diatom communities exhibited a high degree of structural similarity with the control.																			1015-1621						1993	55	1					40	64		10.1007/BF00877258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877258													WOS:A1993KZ67000005

As part of this initiative, we conducted an enclosure experiment in Lake 239 (ON, Canada). Our goal was to follow over time dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) concentrations, after the addition of (HgCl2)-Hg-200, to assess post-depositional Hg dynamics. DGM concentrations reached very high levels in surface waters (up to 6 ng 1(-1)) during the days following the spike. This increase in DGM levels coincided with a decrease in total Hg in the enclosure. Photoreduction rates of Hg were high after spiking (1 ng1(-1) h(-1)) and decreased by two orders of magnitude during the summer, with low rates observed in August (0.01 ng 1(-1) h(-1)). These low rates may be caused by photobleaching of dissolved organic carbon. Water-to-air Hg fluxes (evasion) were measured with a flux chamber and modelled using DGM; both methods yielded similar fluxes when using time-averaged DGM values. Together, these results indicate that, under certain conditions, large amounts of newly deposited Hg(II) may be converted to DGM by photochemical processes and lost by evasion across the air/ water interface.

Moreover, human health can be directly or indirectly affected by environmental factors, due to exposure to contaminants. In central Italy, the summer of 2017 was characterized by high temperature (heat wave) and low rainfall that had an impact on the main reservoir of drinking water (a central Italian lake). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the environmental impact of water abstraction in a Tiber River tributary, as well as to increase knowledge of the link with human and environmental health. The experimental approach was based on the assessment of environmental parameters and ecological quality status through the analysis of biological communities (WFD 2000/60/EC). Furthermore, faecal indicator microorganisms were recovered to evaluate the potential risks for human health. Water and biological samples were collected at three sampling points along the river in different campaigns. The results showed that the sites generally have a good ecological status, although a slight change of boundary class was also observed. It is difficult to establish the cause of this lowering of quality, since it would require a longer period of observation of the communities to determine if it is a reversible process or not, or if it might depend on water abstraction. In conclusion, the ecosystem approach adopted in this study provided a full vision useful for the planning of prevention and/or protection measures for aquatic ecosystems and for human health.					; Cesarini, Giulia/ABC-6145-2021; marcheggiani, stefania/ABH-4965-2020	Chiudioni, Filippo/0000-0002-1952-1450; Martinoli, Marco/0000-0002-3670-9711; marcheggiani, stefania/0000-0002-2021-3893; Cesarini, Giulia/0000-0003-3927-2575; mancini, laura/0000-0003-3667-5221; puccinelli, camilla/0000-0002-2999-6812													0026-265X	1095-9149				SEP	2019	149								104016	10.1016/j.microc.2019.104016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2019.104016													WOS:000480374600055

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The comparative roles of iron and manganese in internal phosphorus loading were examined in a managed lake. Sediments and the water column of Irondequoit Bay, an embayment along Lake Ontario's southern shore, were sampled monthly during summer thermal stratification. Total phosphorus, total iron, and total manganese concentrations in the sediment averaged 1.389 +/- 0.150 g/kg dry wt, 24.415 +/- 0.760 g/kg dry wt, and 1.72 7 +/- 0.053 g/kg dry wt, respectively. Elevated total phosphorus (maximum = 0.915 mg P/L) and soluble reactive phosphorus (maximum = 0.749 mg P/L) concentrations were observed it? the hypolimnion. Sequential extraction of phosphorus fractions from the top 25 cm of deep-water sediment revealed that approximately 25% of phosphorus was stored in a redox-sensitive form, most likely associated with iron and manganese oxyhydroxides. Typically, phosphorus released from sediments is associated with iron, not manganese. However, iron and manganese profiles from the water column indicated that manganese from the sediment was cycling with phosphorus into the overlying waters, while iron did not demonstrate evidence of cycling. Although reductive dissolution of iron likely occurs in the sediment, iron was retained in the sediment and kept out of the water column by the maintenance of low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion.																			0380-1330					DEC	2008	34	4					571	580																WOS:000262663900001
J	Gough, WA; Li, ZH				Gough, William A.; Li, Zhihui			Climate Classification in the Canadian Prairie Provinces Using Day-to-Day Thermal Variability Metrics	ATMOSPHERE												The data from thirty-one climate stations in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba are analyzed using a number of day-to-day thermal variability metrics. These are used to classify each climate station location using a decision tree developed previously. This is the first application of the decision tree to identify stations as having rural, urban, peri-urban, marine, island, airport, or mountain climates. Of the thirty-one, eighteen were identified as peri-urban, with fourteen of these being airports; six were identified as marine or island; four were identified as rural; one as urban was identified; and two were identified as mountain. The two climate stations at Churchill, Manitoba, located near the shores of Hudson Bay, were initially identified as peri-urban. This was re-assessed after adjusting the number of "winter" months used in the metric for identifying marine and island climates (which, for all other analyses, excluded only December, January, and February). For Churchill, to match the sea ice season, the months of November, March, April, and May were also excluded. Then, a strong marine signal was found for both stations. There is a potential to use these thermal metrics to create a sea ice climatology in Hudson Bay, particularly for pre-satellite reconnaissance (1971). Lake Louise and Banff, Alberta, are the first mountain stations to be identified as such outside of British Columbia. Five airport/non-airport pairs are examined to explore the difference between an airport site and a local site uninfluenced by the airport. In two cases, the expected outcome was not realized through the decision tree analysis. Both Jasper and Edmonton Stony Plain were classified as peri-urban. These two locations illustrated the influence of proximity to large highways. In both cases the expected outcome was replaced by peri-urban, reflective of the localized impact of the major highway. This was illustrated in both cases using a time series of the peri-urban metric before and after major highway development, which had statistically significant differences. This speaks to the importance of setting climate stations appropriately away from confounding influences. It also suggests additional metrics to assess the environmental consistency of climate time series.

In this study, pollen and conifer stomata were analyzed from a 2.3 m sediment core extending to 15,330 cal. yr BP recovered from a treeline lake in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming. Both pollen and stomata record a sequence of vegetation and climate change similar in most respects to other regional studies, with sagebrush steppe and lowered treeline during the Late Pleistocene, rapid upward movement of treeline beginning about 11,500 cal. yr BP, treeline above modern between similar to 9000 and 6000 cal. yr BP, and then moving downslope similar to 5000 cal. yr BP, reaching modern limits by similar to 3000 cal. yr BP. Between 6000 and 5000 cal. yr BP sediments become increasingly organic and sedimentation rates increase. We interpret this as evidence for lower lake levels during an extended dry period with warmer summer temperatures and treeline advance. The complex topography of the Rocky Mountains makes it challenging to identify regional patterns associated with short term climatic variability, but our results contribute to gaining a better understanding of past ecologic responses at high elevation sites.

The purpose of the study was to estimate the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation on selected ice cover parameters. The study also attempts to examine other factors that may affect its significant impact on observed changes in the climate. Water temperature data are used to assess temperature conditions in aqueous ecosystems as well as determine the heat absorption capacity of these systems. This allows one to then determine cooling rates in the event of ice cover formation. The data analysis provided in the paper focuses on selected characteristics of ice cover conditions (i.e. dependent variables) including the number of days with ice and maximum ice thickness in relation to NAO index changes (i.e. independent variables) for the reference period 1960/61-2009/10. In addition, the paper divides the studied period into 10-year subperiods in order to capture the weakest and strongest phases of NAO and assess the extent to which they affect the duration of ice cover. A large increase in the mean air temperature (1.8 degrees C) occurred in the years 1960-2010. Trendline analysis indicates that the number of days with ice cover declined by about 60 days and the maximum thickness of ice cover decreased by about 10 cm. Oceanographic research employs satellite image data in order to accurately assess human impact. Therefore, ice cover forecasts generated for consecutive winter seasons may become an important tool in this type of assessment. (c) 2023 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Environmental factors driving the occurrence of the invasive cyanobacterium Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides (Nostocales) in temperate lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms are an increasing threat worldwide. Invasions of certain cyanobacterial species, mainly towards higher latitudes, add to this concern as they enrich the pool of potential bloom-formers in the invaded region. Among the numerous causes of this escalating process, climate warming is commonly considered the most crucial factor, but empirical studies of this issue are lacking. The aim of our study was to identify physical, chemical and biological factors related to the occurrence of an invasive cyanobacterium at the northern border of its putative current range, and thus enabling its expansion. This study focuses on the relatively little studied species Sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides (Nostocales, Cyanobacteria; synonyms: Aphanizomenon aphanizomenoides, Anabaena aphanizomenoides), which is predicted to become one of the main nuisance species of the future. Forty-nine freshwater lakes located between latitudes 51 degrees and 55 degrees N were examined for the presence of S. aphanizomenoides, and environmental factors that could drive its occurrence were studied simultaneously. To identify factors correlated with the presence of the species, principal component analysis (PCA) and Mann-Whitney U test were performed. Water temperature did not differentiate lakes with or without S. aphanizomenoides, however the study was conducted in a particularly hot summer. Total phosphorus concentration was identified as the primary driving factor of the occurrence of S. aphanizomenoides. The species grew in poor light conditions and high phytoplankton biomass, mainly in shallow lakes. As shown by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), the species accompanied shade tolerant, eutrophic species of native and invasive cyanobacteria as well as eukaryotic algae. Our results indicate that eutrophication may be the primary factor enabling the increasing occurrence of S. aphanizomenoides in temperate environments, and suggest that this process may stimulate expansion of cyanobacterial species towards high latitudes.

Time scales of foam stability in shallow conduits: Insights from analogue experiments	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Volcanic systems can exhibit periodical trends in degassing activity, characterized by a wide range of time scales. Understanding the dynamics that control such periodic behavior can provide a picture of the processes occurring in the feeding system. Toward this end, we analyzed the periodicity of outgassing in a series of decompression experiments performed on analogue material (argon-saturated silicone oil plus glass beads/fibers) scaled to serve as models of basaltic magma. To define the effects of liquid viscosity and crystal content on the time scale of outgassing, we investigated both: (1) pure liquid systems, at differing viscosities (100 and 1000 Pa s), and (2) particle-bearing suspensions (diluted and semidiluted). The results indicate that under dynamic conditions (e.g., decompressive bubble growth and fluid ascent within the conduit), the periodicity of foam disruption may be up to several orders of magnitude less than estimates based on the analysis of static conditions. This difference in foam disruption time scale is inferred to result from the contribution of bubble shear and bubble growth to inter-bubble film thinning. The presence of particles in the semidiluted regime is further linked to shorter bubble bursting times, likely resulting from contributions of the presence of a solid network and coalescence processes to the relative increase in bubble breakup rates. Finally, it is argued that these experiments represent a good analogue of gas-piston activity (i.e., the periodical rise-and-fall of a basaltic lava lake surface), implying a dominant role for shallow foam accumulation as a source process for these phenomena.

S. SMITH EX RICHT	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												This study focused on site-specific preferences of potentially harmful cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata to occur in lakes with different ecological and trophic conditions. Its pelagic growth was studied in six lakes from June to September in 1986-1988, 2000-2001 and 2009. In total, 78 samples were taken from the epilimnion (stratified lakes) or the whole water column (non-stratified lakes). Analyses of phytoplankton and environmental variables were performed according to standard methods. During summer, a distinct maximum of the Gloeotrichia growth was observed in July or August (the warmest period). Bloom events of G. echinulata occurred in lakes where the light and oxygen conditions were significantly inferior while the phosphorus content remained on a slightly elevated level. The distinct domination of this cyanobacterium (above 40% of the total phytoplankton biomass) was limited to lakes with a high, moderate or even poor ecological status, and to the mesa-eutrophic or eutrophic state of lakes. However, G. echinulata occurred in a broader range of ecological and trophic conditions of lakes. The historical approach to mass occurrence of G. echinulata, with its possible contribution to phosphorus translocation from sediment to the pelagic zone, suggested its importance as an indicator of progressive ecological and trophic deterioration of lakes. This indication should be very useful for establishment of main targets in water management.

Yellowstone Lake: high-energy geochemistry and rich bacterial diversity	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Yellowstone Lake is central to the balanced functioning of the Yellowstone ecosystem, yet little is known about the microbial component of its food chain. A remotely operated vehicle provided video documentation (http://www.tbi.montana.edu/media/videos/) and allowed sampling of dilute surface zone waters and enriched lake floor hydrothermal vent fluids. Vent emissions contained substantial H2S, CH4, CO2 and H-2, although CH4 and H-2 levels were also significant throughout the lake. Pyrosequencing and near full-length sequencing of Bacteria 16S rRNA gene diversity associated with two vents and two surface water environments demonstrated that this lake contains significant bacterial diversity. Biomass was size-fractionated by sequentially filtering through 20-mu m-, 3.0-mu m-, 0.8-mu m- and 0.1-mu m-pore-size filters, with the > 0.1 to < 0.8 mu m size class being the focus of this study. Major phyla included Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, with 21 other phyla represented at varying levels. Surface waters were dominated by two phylotypes: the Actinobacteria freshwater acI group and an alpha-Proteobacteria clade tightly linked with freshwater SAR11-like organisms. We also obtained evidence of novel thermophiles and recovered Prochlorococcus phylotypes (97-100% identity) in one near surface photic zone region of the lake. The combined geochemical and microbial analyses suggest that the foundation of this lake's food chain is not simple. Phototrophy presumably is an important driver of primary productivity in photic zone waters; however, chemosynthetic hydrogenotrophy and methanotrophy are likely important components of the lake's food chain.					; Kan, Jinjun/C-5252-2011; Jiang, Hongchen/Y-9471-2018	McDermott, Tim/0000-0001-8293-5106; Jiang, Hongchen/0000-0003-1271-7028; Clingenpeel, Scott/0000-0002-6619-6320													1462-2912	1462-2920				AUG	2011	13	8					2172	2185		10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02466.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02466.x								21450005					WOS:000294075600019

Moreover, most studies on filamentous algae have been carried out in permanent freshwaters. Seventeen waterbodies from ephemeral streams of semiarid south-eastern Spain ('ramblas') were surveyed from a botanical, phycological and ecological point of view over a four-year period. Gradients of environmental conditions ranged from fresh to saline water (0.27 to 47 mS cm(-1)), from ephemeral to permanent and from pools to streams. Most of the sites were springs or streams that appeared in certain reaches as a result of the upwelling of groundwater. In total, 47 species of submerged macrophytes and macroalgae were recorded, with 1-18 species per site. The most diverse orders were Zygnematales, Oedogoniales and Charales, although the importance and diversification of Vaucheriales in some places was also of note. Multivariate analysis identified salinity as the main factor explaining species distribution. Conductivity ranges for species were compared with other saline habitats such as saline lakes, saltmarshes or coastal lagoons. Finally, this study broadens the ecological range of some taxa and highlights the ecological importance of these kinds of systems for the preservation of biodiversity in arid lands.

The amphipod Hyalella azteca and the chironomids Procladius freemani, Chironomus nr. muratensis and Cryptochironomus spp. were important at lower salinities (1-12 g .cntdot. l-1) whereas the chironomids Tanypus nubifer, Cricotopus ornatus and Chironomus nr. annularis dominated at moderate salinities (5-30 g .cntdot. l-1) and dolichopodid and ephyrid dipterans were the only species in hypersaline lakes (> 50 g .cntdot. l-1). Diversity decreased significantly with increased salinity. Mean dry biomass ranged from 0-91.2 g .cntdot. m-2, showing little correlation with salinity, though hyposaline lakes often had elevated values and hypersaline lakes very low values. Shallow lakes (< 5 m) had significantly lower standing crops. There were long term changes in biomass (over 45 years) in some lakes due to cultural eutrophication or secular changes in salinity.

Common Turkic folk geographical terms of the Kyzylkum region	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY												The article deals with the general Turkic toponymy of the Kyzylkum region, in particular, the folk geographical terms present in the topography of this territory. Despite the harsh climatic conditions of the desert, this territory has been developed by man since ancient times, which proves the presence of historical toponyms and ethnonyms. The toponymy of the region is characterized by the active participation of various folk geographical terms in the structure of landscape names. Folk geographic terms kum, tau, bulak, kol, sai, aryk, kudyk, suat, ozen, keshu, oi, boget, ashy, kesik, and others were an inexhaustible source for designating orographic, hydrographic and other objects. The richness and diversity of the region's toponymic system was directly related to the economic activities of its original inhabitants. Transhumance of the desert natives required a detailed knowledge of the features of the physical and geographical structure of their own habitat, taking into account the natural and climatic conditions and landscape specifics of the entire territory of animal pasturing, i.e. deserts, mountains, rivers, lakes, springs, watering holes, fords and crossings, as well as the exact language designation of these objects. Thus, economic activity contributed to the fact that a nomadic tribe knew its territory thoroughly, down to small objects, and created a developed toponymic system. The collected toponymic material is considered in the lexical-semantic, etymological and linguo-geographical aspects in order to identify specific units that are generally characteristic of common Turkic folk geographical terms. In the process of studying a number of oronyms, hydronyms, dromonyms, gephyronyms, it was established that, in this territory, despite the flatness of the terrain, there were many oronyms with components tau (mountain), tobe (hill). In addition, contrary to logic, a significant number of hydronyms was found in the desert with components, kudyk (well), suat (place of watering hole), bulak (spring). The term kesik, literally "cut", which was used to designate barchans with sharp, as if cut edges that one can meet in the sandy desert, was described for the first time. Also, common Turkic structural formations were identified that arose according to the type: numeral + term. The use of sacred numerals in the structure of toponyms with folk geographical terms denoting the conditional meaning of plurality was established. In the etymological aspect, special attention was paid to the consideration of the dromonym Yassykeshu, which correlates with the name of the medieval polysonym Yassy, an important city on the segment of the Great Silk Road passing through Kyzylkum. Its scientific etymology has not yet received a positive decision. A substantiated etymology was proposed, which allows to clarify the lost history of origin and the obscured semantics of the polysonym Yassy.																			1998-6645	2310-5046				FEB	2024	87						72	90		10.17223/19986645/87/4	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/19986645/87/4													WOS:001221361900004

The magnesite ores of the Kamado deposit are unconformably underlain by mid-Jurassic marine carbonate and ultramafic rocks of the Bangong-Nujiang ophiolite suite and are in fault contact with hanging wall rocks composed of siliceous sinter. Three types of cryptocrystalline magnesite ores can be identified in Kamado: (1) strata-bound massive magnesites, representing the main ore type in the upper part; (2) banded ores in the lower part; and (3) some vein and stockwork ore in the ultramafic wall rocks. Integrated scanning electron microscopy, C-O isotope analysis, and geochemical analyses were carried out on the Kamado deposit. The results indicate that: (1) the orebody is composed of magnesite, with accessory minerals of aragonite, opal, and chromite; (2) the siliceous sinter and relatively high B (32.0-68.1 ppm) and Li (14.7-23.4 ppm) contents of the magnesite ores reflect long-term spring activity in Kamado; (3) the light carbon (delta 13CV-PDB: -4.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand to -4.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) and oxygen isotopic compositions (delta 18OV-SMOW: +12.3 +/- 0.3 to +16.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) of the stockwork ores in the foot wall rocks indicated that the carbon in fractures in the ultramafic rocks is from a mixture of marine carbonate and oxidized organic-rich sedimentary rocks, reflecting a typical "Kraubath-type" magnesite deposit; and (4) the relatively heavy carbon isotopic (delta 13CV-PDB: +8.7 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand to +8.8 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) composition of the banded magnesite ores in the lower segment may have formed from heavy CO2 generated by anaerobic fermentation in the lakebed. Additionally, the carbon isotopic (delta 13CV-PDB: +7.3 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand to +7.7 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) composition of the massive magnesite ores in the upper segment indicates a decline in the participation of anaerobic fermentation. As this economically valuable deposit is of the strata-bound massive ore type, Kamado can be classified as a lacustrine hydrothermal-sedimentary magnesite deposit, formed by continuous spring activities under salt lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, with the Mg mainly being contributed by nearby ultramafic rocks and the carbon mainly being sourced from atmosphere-lake water exchange, with minor amounts from marine carbonate strata.

J	LINDSEY, CC				LINDSEY, CC			SYMPATRIC OCCURRENCE OF 2 SPECIES OF HUMPBACK WHITEFISH IN SQUANGA LAKE, YUKON TERRITORY	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Squanga Lake in the Canadian headwaters of the Yukon River contains two species of humpback whitefish, characterized by modal first arch gill raker counts of 23 and 28 but with overlap in the range of counts. The species can be separated more sharply by raker counts of the second arch, also with modes of 23 and 28. Seven other morphometric characters not correlated with gill raker count each have significantly different means, but some overlap, between the species. In June the species with high raker count mainly occupies the pelagic zone, while the low count species occupies the bottom layers at all depths. The high count species feeds mainly on plankton, the low count species on bottom organisms. The high count species spawns in inlet and outlet streams in November and December. Gonad development in June suggests that the low count form spawns later, in localities unknown. Samples from early winter spawning runs contained exclusively high count individuals. A few fish, probably hybrids, had raker count corresponding to one species and most other morphological characters corresponding to the other. Tentative names for the species are Coregonus clupeaformis (high gill raker count) and Coregonus pidschian.																									1963	20	3					749	+		10.1139/f63-050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-050													WOS:A1963WV54300009
J	Povilaitis, A; Stålnacke, P; Vassiljev, A				Povilaitis, Arvydas; Stalnacke, Per; Vassiljev, Anatoly			Nutrient retention and export to surface waters in Lithuanian and Estonian river basins	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The statistical model MESAW was applied to simultaneously estimate export coefficients and retention of nutrients in four Lithuanian and three Estonian river basins (range 946-8,388 km(2)). This modelling approach uses non-linear regression to yield the export coefficients for total nitrogen and total phosphorus losses to surface waters, considering different land-use classes and retention of nutrients in the river network. The model was applied to data from 40 water quality monitoring sites and corresponding sub-basin data on land use, point sources and atmospheric deposition. The results showed that the studied river basins had a high nutrient retention capacity: 67-78 and 24-63% of total nitrogen and total phosphorus inputs remained in surface waters. The estimated retention was large in lakes: 27-59% for nitrogen and 11-31% for phosphorus. In-stream retention was apparently much lower, in the range 11-15% for total N and 3-12% for total P. Retention in lakes was lower in Estonia than in Lithuania due to the locations and smaller areas of the lakes in the Estonian basins. In Estonia, the highest relative retention in lakes was 46% for nitrogen and 35% for phosphorus. In-stream retention was also somewhat lower than in Lithuania, possibly because of the lower temperature in Estonian rivers in summer.

Brackish-water residency and semi-anadromy in Arctic lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) inferred from otolith microchemistry	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, are considered a freshwater species but have been documented using brackish and marine water environments in the Arctic in a semi-anadromous manner. The objective of this study was to describe lake trout life histories present in the brackish waters of Husky Lakes, Northwest Territories (NT) using otolith strontium (Sr) profiles obtained by Laser Ablation Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Lake trout from Husky Lakes and Noell Lake (freshwater), NT were sampled by spring hook-and line angling and open water gillnetting in 2000-2004,2009 and 2012 by local subsistence fishers as part of a larger ecological assessment. Harvested fish were sampled for biological data and tissue samples including otoliths. The otoliths were prepared for line scan analysis of Sr from the core region to the outer edge by LA-ICP-MS. Sr profiles were evaluated visually suggesting the presence of two life histories within Husky Lakes, semianadromy (14%, n = 8) and brackish -water residency (86%, n = 50). The visual classification of life histories was supported using generalized linear mixed effects modeling indicating that a minimum of two distinct ecosystems (fresh and brackish water) were used during early life by lake trout from Husky Lakes. Otolith Sr profiles also show that the majority of Husky Lakes lake trout sampled (86%) spawn and spend their entire lives in the brackish waters of Husky Lakes. These are the first data to support an entirely brackish -water resident life history for lake trout. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gorman, WL				Gorman, Wendy L.			Stream Water Quality and Service Learning in an Introductory Biology Class	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOLOGY EDUCATION												Northland College is a small environmental liberal arts college in northern Wisconsin near Lake Superior. In the fall of 2007 and 2008 students in a mixed science majors/non-majors introductory biology course engaged in a semester-long, service-learning project to monitor E. coli in city stormwater draining into Bay City Creek, a small stream that flows through campus and the town of Ashland before flowing into Lake Superior. Such monitoring is beyond the budget of most municipalities, but is an important public health and aesthetic issue for Ashland and Lake Superior. Our hypothesis was that this service-learning research project would have a positive impact on student learning and student perception of science, and the project would generate useful information for city leaders. Students collected and processed water samples using a standard protocol, analyzed the effect of stormwater on stream water quality, and presented their data in the form of posters to the mayor, a city administrator, and the Provost. Student learning was assessed by a poster-grading rubric, and by online and Northland College instruments. Student perceptions of science were found to be more positive than in the year preceding this project, even when clear answers were not found from their scientific investigation, and there appeared to be no distinction in responses between science majors and non-majors.																			1935-7877	1935-7885				MAY	2010	11	1					21	27		10.1128/jmbe.v11.i1.140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v11.i1.140								23653693					WOS:000449681500003

With its central position between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, the Sevkar loess area serves as important bridge between loess sections in southeastern Europe and Central Asia. Establishing a numerical chronology of the Achajur loess section enables correlation with other loess-palaeosol sections and a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the region. In this paper, we focus on the chronology of the last glacial-interglacial cycle using luminescence dating on fine grain (4-11 mu m) material. We compare two post-IR-IRSL protocols on polymineral fine grain using different stimulation temperatures, in order to evaluate the influence of fading and potential unbleachable residuals on our samples. For a backup of the younger ages (<50 ka), we also applied a single aliquot protocol on the quartz fine grain fraction. The results indicate that the upper loess unit was deposited during MIS3 and 4, while MIS2 ages are not present. The underlying pedocomplex and loess unit fall into MIS5 and MIS6, respectively. This confirms that the loess was deposited during dry phases and pedocomplexes formed during wetter phases, as is also shown by comparison with other palaeoenvironmental proxies from the area.					; Wolf, Daniel/A-3766-2013	Hovakimyan, Hayk/0000-0003-1377-9642; Sahakyan, Lilit/0000-0002-5539-5690; 														2296-6463				DEC 7	2021	9								755084	10.3389/feart.2021.755084	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.755084													WOS:000742948800001
J	Balmer, ME; Buser, HR; Müller, MD; Poiger, T				Balmer, ME; Buser, HR; Müller, MD; Poiger, T			Occurrence of some organic UV filters in wastewater, in surface waters, and in fish from Swiss lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Organic UV filters are used in personal care products such as sunscreen products, and in cosmetics, beauty creams, skin lotions, lipsticks, hair sprays, hair dyes, shampoos, and so forth. The compounds enter the aquatic environment from showering, wash-off, washing (laundering), and so forth via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) ("indirect inputs") and from recreational activities such as swimming and bathing in lakes and rivers ("direct inputs"). In this study, we investigated the occurrence of four important organic UV filter compounds (benzophenone-3, BP-3; 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, 4-MBC; ethylhexyl methoxy cinnamate, EHMC; octocrylene, OC) in wastewater, and in water and fish from various Swiss lakes, using gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric analyses. All four UV filters were present in untreated wastewater (WWTP influent) with a maximum concentration of 19 mug L-1 for EHMC. The data indicate a seasonal variation with influent loads higher in the warmer season (June 2002) than in the colder one (April 2002). The influent loads were in the order EHIVIC > 4-MBC similar to BP-3 > OC. The concentrations in treated wastewater (WWTP effluent) were considerably lower, indicating substantial elimination in the plants. 4-MBC was usually the most prevalent compound (maximum concentration, 2.7 mug L-1), followed by BP-3, EHMC, and OC. UV filters were also detected in Swiss midland lakes and a river (Limmat) receiving inputs from WWTPs and recreational activities. However, all concentrations were low (<2-35 ng L-1); no UV filters (<2 ng L-1) were detected in a remote mountain lake. Data from passive sampling using semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) supported the presence of these UV filters in the lakes and the river and suggested some potential for accumulation of these compounds in biota. SPMD-derived water concentrations increased in the order Greifensee < Zurichsee < Hottnersee. This order is reversed from that observed for methyl triclosan, used as a chemical marker for WWTP-derived lipophilic contaminants in the lakes. This indicated inputs of UV filters from sources other than WWTPs to the lakes during summer, for example, inputs from recreational activities. Fish (white fish, Coregonus sp.; roach, Rutilus rutilus; perch, Perca fluviatilis) from these, lakes contained low but detectable concentrations of UV filters, in particular, 4-MbC (up to 166 ng g(-1) on a lipid basis). 4-MBC concentrations relative to methyl triclosan were lower in fish than in SPMDs exposed in the same lakes, suggesting that 4-MBC is less bioaccumulated than expected or metabolized in fish. The lipid-based bioconcentration factor (BCFL) estimated from the fish (roach) data and SPMD-derived water concentrations was about 1-2.3 x 10(4) and thus approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than expected from its K-OW value.

Lake Hamoun is located at the border of Iran and Afghanistan where inflowing rivers originate from the drainage basins of SW Hindu Kush Mountains and westernmost Himalaya. The lake has experienced a complex hydrological history during the late Quaternary due to climatic changes. Geochemical, sedimentological, and paleontological proxies as well as geomorphological data were used to investigate environmental changes of the lake. The results demonstrate that since the late glacial, the basin has directly and/or indirectly received its moisture from various climatic systems. During the early Holocene, both the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the mid-latitude westerlies (MLW) intensified and consequently the basin received higher precipitation. This interpretation is supported by higher content of total organic matter (mean: 8.2%), finer-grained sediments with low delta O-18 values (mean: -3.5%), as well as rich fossil content. Lower organic matter content (,< 5%), higher magnetic susceptibility values (5.8-10x10(-4) SI unit), and coarser-grained sediments with no shell fragments support the dominance of an arid environment during the early-mid Holocene. The results of stable isotopes suggest weakening of ISM and intensification of MLW during the mid-late Holocene in the study area, when Bronze Age civilizations emerged in the Sistan Basin. In the late Holocene, lake levels experienced more severe fluctuations due to variations in the MLW. Shifts in settlement areas seen in the archaeological record may thus have been a response to climatic changes.

These episodes often arise following development of persistent cold-air pools (PCAPs) that limit mixing and modify chemistry. While field campaigns targeting either basin meteorology or wintertime pollution chemistry have been conducted, coupling between interconnected chemical and meteorological processes remains an insufficiently studied research area. Gaps in understanding the coupled chemical-meteorological interactions that drive high-pollution events make identification of the most effective air-basin specific emission control strategies challenging. To address this, a September 2019 workshop occurred with the goal of planning a future research campaign to investigate air quality in western U.S. basins. Approximately 120 people participated, representing 50 institutions and five countries. Workshop participants outlined the rationale and design for a comprehensive wintertime study that would couple atmospheric chemistry and boundary layer and complex-terrain meteorology within western U.S. basins. Participants concluded the study should focus on two regions with contrasting aerosol chemistry: three populated valleys within Utah (Salt Lake, Utah, and Cache Valleys) and the San Joaquin Valley in California. This paper describes the scientific rationale for a campaign that will acquire chemical and meteorological datasets using airborne platforms with extensive range, coupled to surface-based measurements focusing on sampling within the near-surface boundary layer, and transport and mixing processes within this layer, with high vertical resolution at a number of representative sites. No prior wintertime basin-focused campaign has provided the breadth of observations necessary to characterize the meteorological-chemical linkages outlined here, nor to validate complex processes within coupled atmosphere-chemistry models.

J	Dönmez, S				Donmez, Senayi			Assessing Aksehir Lake's recession using meteorological and Earth observation data	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY												Climate change is an acknowledged phenomenon. Even so, its consequences are not easily predictable. Lakes in Lakes Region of southwestern Turkey have been shrinking. Aksehir Lake, located on important bird migration routes, is one of those aforementioned lakes that has continually shrunk until completely drying up in 2008. This study aims to investigate the variation of meteorological and hydrological parameters during the shrinking and drying up of Lake Aksehir. Previous studies were mainly related with coastline changes of Aksehir Lake and attributed the changes to increased air temperatures and evaporation in conjunction with reduced precipitation and decreased surface flow. In this study, snow dynamics, both snow cover (SC) extent and duration besides snow water equivalent (SWE) are also investigated. Moreover, the inclusion of soil moisture (SM) data is additions to the current literature. SC, SWE and SM data obtained from satellite images recorded over the study area indicated that SC both in extent and duration was smallest during the 2008 winter-the same year in which the lake totally dried. SWE and SM values were also lowest during the study period. These were in agreement with the highest recorded air temperatures and reduced precipitation with respect to long-term averages over the study period. Recorded high evaporations above the long-term averages might have intensified recession which eventually resulted in drying of lake in 2008.

We examined changes in macroinvertebrate communities caused by increased temperature (3 degrees C above ambient during summer only and continuous 3 degrees C above ambient all year round), influences of fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) and addition of nutrients ( nitrogen and phosphorus) in 48 large-scale (3000 l) tanks over a 2 year period. While numbers of Isopoda, Chaoborus, Corixidae, Ephemeroptera, Notonectidae and Odonata were reduced by the presence of fish, nutrient addition caused isopods, corixids, mayflies and odonates to increase in abundance. Impacts of temperature increase were surprisingly low, with only gastropods increasing in heated tanks, suggesting that, overall abundances of most macroinvertebrate taxa will not be severely affected by the predicted temperature rise. To determine if taxa were sampled representatively during the experiment, net sweep samples taken towards the end of the experiment were compared with final macroinvertebrate abundances when the complete contents of each tank were harvested. We found that net sweeping is an appropriate semi-quantitative method for most taxa in mesocosm tanks. However, mites, coleopteran adults and larvae, dipterans and Chaoborus were not adequately sampled. This might explain why we could not detect any treatment effects of temperature, fish or nutrients on mites, coleopterans and dipterans and calls for different sampling techniques for these taxa, especially in ponds with vegetation stands.

The lakes, frozen annually during winter, included freshwater and brackish systems (EC > 1000 mu S cm(-1) ; range: 171-12607 mu S cm(-1) in underlying water). Results showed that lake ice contained lower DOC (7.2 mg L-1) and DIC (6.7 mg L-1) concentration compared to the underlying waters (58.2 and 142.4 mg L-1, respectively). Large differences in DOC and DIC concentrations of underlying waters were also observed between freshwater (mean +/- SD: 22.3 +/- 11.5 mg L-1, 50.7 +/- 20.6 mg L-1) and brackish lakes (83.3 +/- 138.0 mg L-1, 247.0 +/- 410.5 mg L-1). A mass balance model was developed to describe the relative distribution of solutes and chemical attributes between ice and the underlying waters. Results showed that water depth and ice thickness were the key factors regulating the spatial distribution of solutes in the frozen lakes. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 320 nm, a(CDOM)(320) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) were used to characterize CDOM composition and quality. Compared to the underlying waters, CDOM present in ice largely included low aromaticity organic substances, an outcome perhaps facilitated by ice formation and photo-degradation. In ice and underlying freshwaters, CDOM predominantly included organic C fractions of high aromaticity, while low aromaticity organic substances were observed for brackish lakes. Results of this study suggest that, if water salinity increases due to climate change and anthropogenic activities, significant changes can occur in the dissolved carbon and fate of CDOM in these shallow lakes.

Due to the area's high altitude, there is relatively little information about its lakes. Therefore, to supplement the basic information of lakes in the area, this study collected surface water samples from 12 lakes, including Gangtang Co, Pusaier Co, Guojialin Co, Dagze Co, Yangnapeng Co, Bankog Co, Dangqung Co, Chaxiabu Co, Angdar Co, Bengze Co, Guogen Co, and Yibug Caka from July to August 2020. Furthermore, the factors controlling the lake water chemistry characteristics and the main ion sources were explored using the Piper, Gibbs, and ion ratio methods. The results were as follows: (1) The lakes had high levels of salt, alkalinity, and mineralization, and all the lakes except Bengze Co were salt lakes. The 12 lakes met the Class V water standard. (2) Dangqung Co, Bankog Co, Guojialin Co, Daze Co, and Yangnapeng Co were in the initial stage of lake succession, while the others were in the later stages of lake succession. (3) Evaporation-crystallization was the most important factor controlling the water chemistry of the 12 lakes, and most of the ions in the lakes come from the dissolution of evaporite.					; Wang, Fangfang/KII-9109-2024; Liu, Xiaoshou/B-3741-2008; Jin, Yifan/GLV-2284-2022; Liu, Xiaoshou/I-3001-2019	Wang, Fang/0000-0002-5787-1603; Liu, Xiaoshou/0000-0002-0017-7186; 														2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	16							2900	10.3390/w15162900	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15162900													WOS:001055306000001

On the diversity of fungi from soda soils	FUNGAL DIVERSITY												The diversity of filamentous fungi that can grow at high ambient pH values (i.e., 8-11) remains largely understudied. Here we study 100 alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic isolates from the soils around the basin of soda lakes in Asia and Africa to assess the major evolutionary lineages and morphologies pertinent to the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi. The Emericellopsis lineage (Hypocreales, Hypocreomycetidae), along with Plectosphaerellaceae (Hypocreomycetidae), Pleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes), Chaetomiaceae (Sordariomycetidae) families appeared to be overrepresented with strong alkalitolerants and effective alkaliphiles. In particular, Sodiomyces species (Plectosphaerellaceae), Acrostalagmus luteoalbus (Plectosphaerellaceae), Emericellopsis alkalina (Hypocreales), Thielavia sp. (Chaetomiaceae), and Alternaria sect. Soda (Pleosporaceae) grew best at high ambient pH. The pH tolerance of Chordomyces antarcticum, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus and some other species was largely affected by the presence of extra Na+ in the growth medium. Moderate alkalitolerants included Scopulariopsis members (Microascales), Fusarium, Cladosporium, and many asexual acremonium-like species from Bionectriaceae. Weak alkalitolerants were represented by sporadic isolates of Penicillium, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Alternaria alternata species, with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH. Weak alkalitolerants develop loose dry chains of spores easily dispersed by air. Their presence at low frequency with the growth optimum at neutral or acidic pH leads us to treat them as transient species in the alkaline soils, as those are also ubiquitous saprobes in normal soils. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the alkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi has evolved several times. Several lineages harboring strong alkalitolerants derived from the known marine-borne fungi (Emericellopsis, Alternaria sect. Phragmosporae), or fall within the fungi associated with halophytic grasses (Pleosporaceae). Soda soils contain a diversity of fungi that range from weak alkalitolerant to alkaliphilic, which in few cases is associated with darkly pigmented mycelium and formation of microsclerotia. The alkaliphilic trait is spread throughout the Ascomycota, and usually juxtaposes with slime-covered polyphyletic acremonium-, verticillium-, gliocladium-types of asexual morphology, hyphae aggregating in chords, and enclosed fruit bodies.					; Georgieva, Marina/K-7729-2014	Grum-Grzhimaylo, Alexey/0000-0001-5512-6223; Debets, Alfons j m/0000-0002-1799-4617; Bondarenko, Sofiya/0000-0003-0838-7564; Georgieva, Marina/0000-0002-7657-6474													1560-2745	1878-9129				JAN	2016	76	1			SI		27	74		10.1007/s13225-015-0320-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-015-0320-2													WOS:000368367400003

In our investigation of the observed deformation, we constructed an optimum-source model of the event between Miyake and Kozu Islands. We then made an inversion analysis of the differences between the observed displacement field and the calculated displacement field from the optimum model, assuming that the differences were caused by the changes in the interplate coupling beneath the Tokai region. From the inversion analysis of data for each of three-month periods, May to August, June to September, and July to October, we found decreased interplate coupling in the early stages of the 2000 event. In the first stage, either a slow slip or a temporary suspension of the plate subduction occurred in the focal region of the anticipated Tokai earthquake. The area then extended to the west and, finally, a slow slip exceeded the secular convergence velocity on the plate interface near Lake Hamana in the fall of 2000. We believe this ongoing slow slip began in August or early September 2000.																				1880-5981					2005	57	6					507	513		10.1186/BF03352584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/BF03352584													WOS:000230251700004

The paper analyses and discusses the recent evolution of a representative glacierized group within the Italian Alps, the Piazzi-DosdS, where small glaciers are experiencing considerable retreat and shrinking. We analysed aerial photos to calculate area and geometry changes in the time window 1954-2003, and glaciological and geomorphological surveys were also performed. The estimated area change during 1954-2003 was -3.97 km(2) (-51% of the area coverage in 1954). Area reduction increased more recently: area change during 1991-2003 (12 years) was -1.74 km(2), against -0.67 km(2) during 1981-1991 (10 years), and -1.57 km (2) during 1954-1981 (27 years). Moreover, analysis of the most recent orthophotos acquired during the summer of 2003 under exceptional conditions (i.e. total absence of snow cover) allowed observation and mapping of changes affecting glacier shape and morphology, including growing rock outcrops, tongue separations, formation of proglacial lakes, increasing supraglacial debris and collapse structures. Such processes cause positive feedbacks that accelerate further glacier disintegration once they appear. From a geodynamical perspective, the DosdS Piazzi is now experiencing transition from a glacial system to a paraglacial one; areas where in the past the shaping and driving factors were glaciers are now subject to the action of melting water, slope evolution and periglacial processes.					; Diolaiuti, Guglielmina/A-9422-2008	Smiraglia, Claudio/0000-0001-6635-2074; Maragno, Davide/0000-0003-4725-7244; D'Agata, Carlo/0000-0002-3337-7301; Diolaiuti, Guglielmina/0000-0002-3883-9309													0309-1333	1477-0296				APR	2011	35	2					161	182		10.1177/0309133311399494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133311399494													WOS:000289005300002

Water relations and photosynthesis along an elevation gradient for Artemisia tridentata during an historic drought	OECOLOGIA												Quantifying the variation in plant-water relations and photosynthesis over environmental gradients and during unique events can provide a better understanding of vegetation patterns in a future climate. We evaluated the hypotheses that photosynthesis and plant water potential would correspond to gradients in precipitation and soil moisture during a lengthy drought, and that experimental water additions would increase photosynthesis for the widespread evergreen shrub Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana. We quantified abiotic conditions and physiological characteristics for control and watered plants at 2135, 2315, and 2835 m near Mammoth Lakes, CA, USA, at the ecotone of the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin ecoregions. Snowfall, total precipitation, and soil moisture increased with elevation, but air temperature and soil N content did not. Plant water potential (psi), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max)), carboxylation rate (V-cmax), and electron transport rate (J(max)) all significantly increased with elevations. Addition of water increased psi, g(s), J(max), and A(max) only at the lowest elevation; g(s) contributed about 30 % of the constraints on photosynthesis at the lowest elevation and 23 % at the other two elevations. The physiology of this foundational shrub species was quite resilient to this 1-in-1200 year drought. However, plant water potential and photosynthesis corresponded to differences in soil moisture across the gradient. Soil re-wetting in early summer increased water potential and photosynthesis at the lowest elevation. Effects on water relations and photosynthesis of this widespread, cold desert shrub species may be disproportionate at lower elevations as drought length increases in a future climate.

Treatment with chemical coagulants at different dosing levels changes ecotoxicity of stormwater from the Tahoe basin, California, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In recent decades, the transport of stormwater-associated fine particles and phosphorus into Lake Tahoe has led to decreased water clarity and related ecological changes. Polyaluminum chloride coagulants (PACs) have shown great promise in removing these constituents from stormwater before it enters the lake. However, the potential risks of coagulant treatment to aquatic organisms are not well understood. This study investigated stormwater and coagulant toxicity under non-dosed, optimally-dosed, and over-dosed conditions using the US EPA 3-species test through growth of green algae (Selenastrum capricornutum), zooplankton (waterflea, Ceriodaphnia dubia) mortality and reproduction, and larval fish (fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas) mortality and biomass. Stormwater samples were collected during a 2005 spring snowmelt runoff event from three sites representing various forms of developed regions around Lake Tahoe. Samples were dosed with two different coagulants (a chitosan and a PAC) at levels optimized with a streaming current detector (SCD). Non-treated highway runoff was toxic to zooplankton and fish. Optimal coagulant dosing increased algal growth and reduced zooplankton toxicity. Overdosing at two and three times the optimal level of a PAC decreased zooplankton reproduction and increased fish mortality. PAC-related toxicity was correlated with increasing total unfiltered aluminum and decreasing alkalinity, pH, and DOC. Because of toxicity risks, we recommend keeping PAC coagulant dosing at or below optimal levels in practice.

Groundwater quality evaluation of the alluvial aquifers using GIS and water quality indices in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia	GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Groundwater (GW), which contributes to the quality of life, economic development, improved food security, and rural society stability, is essential to improving rural water supply access and quality. Given its multi-purpose uses, GW quality has been degraded and polluted by global climate change, population growth, human activities, land use land cover (LULC) transition. GW quality, therefore, should be evaluated and tracked continuously to secure its multi-purpose uses. Herein, this study aims to assess the shallow GW standard using water quality indices (WQI) and GIS techniques in the northwestern boundary of Lake Tana, Upper Blue Nile (UBN) of the Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The water samples were collected from 30 sites, and physico-chemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC) were measured in situ. Calcium (Ca+), magnesium (Mg+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chlorine (Cl-), sulphate (SO4-2), nitrate (NO-3), bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbonate (CO3-2) concentraions were determined. Irrigation water quality indices, including sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium soluble percentage (SSP), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR), and Na% were calculated. The results show that EC (46.7%), SAR (97%), KR (53%), SSP (53.3%) MH (100%) and Na+ (50%) are suitable for irrigation. The overall WQI for drinking purposes ranges from 46 to 67.5, which confirms that 22%, 38.8%, and 39.2% of samples fall under very good, good, and poor quality, respectively. The hydrochemical facies indicated that, the dominant water type (43% of samples) is type-III (Na-K-Cl-SO4) and mixed type. Most shallow wells near Lake Tana are unsuitable for drinking purpose. Further, the government should monitor contamination sources, including agricultural activities, domestic wastes and landfills for sustainable GW quality.

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of interactions of surface water and groundwater: influences an wetland disappearance	INGENIERIA HIDRAULICA EN MEXICO												Groundwater is the primary water source in the valley of Toluca, this demand has been accompanied by the over-exploitation of the aquifer the disappearance of wetlands and a significant risk to long-term groundwater quality. A combined approach of field investigation and numerical modeling was adopted to assess the groundwater-surface water interactions within the wetland system. Potentiometric data indicate that current downward vertical hydraulic gradients below the lake and wetland area are extremely low suggesting very slow infiltration rates. Geochemical and isotope data from surface water and groundwater sampling also indicate that very little surface water infiltration has occurred. Numerical simulations demonstrate quantitatively that enhanced surface water infiltration is unlikely to be the primary cause in the disappearance of the wetland system as previously thought. Other factors such as modifications to the surface water drainage system and decreasing spring flow from the surrounding mountainous regions are likely more significant. Simulations also suggest that contaminants originating in the remaining wetland system are currently entering nearby production wells. The extent to which the contaminants presently affect the production wells is not well understood, although they clearly represent a threat to the long-term quality of this significant water supply source.

First, stronger warming of northern hemisphere continents, weaker southern hemisphere warming, and related more extensive northward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during interglacial marine isotope stage (MIS) 13 intensified and expanded precipitation in Asian monsoon regions and in other widespread northern hemisphere regions, with accompanying carbon reservoir changes featuring globally high marine benthic delta C-13 values because of vegetation expansion at similar to 500 ka. Subdued southern hemisphere warming and northward ITCZ displacement decreased southern hemisphere precipitation simultaneously during MIS 13. Second, a shift to globally warmer interglacials at similar to 400 ka, with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, smaller ice volume, and higher sea level resulted in sustained high interglacial precipitation in East Asia from MIS 11 onward and sustained high marine benthic delta C-13 values during MIS 11. We also synthesize palaeoanthropological data and find that the climate and ecosystem changes across the MBT coincided with the timing of human lineage diversification, including the emergence of Neanderthals and Denisovans in Eurasia and Homo sapiens in Africa, and their potential coexistence with H. heidelbergensis, H. erectus, H. floresiensis, H. naledi, and other Homo archaics. The timing of the MBT also coincided with novel hominin behavioural developments, including fire control and the transition from handaxe industries to more versatile Levallois techniques. Combined with environmental theories of human evolution, this chronological coincidence suggests a potential link between mid-Pleistocene environmental changes and human evolution.					; Liu, Zhonghui/D-3163-2009; Roberts, Andrew/E-6422-2010; Stringer, Chris/LCD-6435-2024; Yang, Pingguo/AAY-4906-2021; Yu, Jimin/I-7770-2012; LI, XIAN/JDV-8815-2023; Rohling, Eelco/B-9736-2008; ao, hong/I-8623-2014; Zhou, Weijian/T-1412-2019; Dupont-Nivet, Guillaume/HII-9066-2022; jin, zhang/AAL-8055-2020; Shi, Zhengguo/F-3106-2011; AN, Zhisheng/F-8834-2012; Zhang, Peng/P-8607-2014	Roberts, Andrew P./0000-0003-0566-8117; Liu, Zhonghui/0000-0002-2168-8305; Yu, Jimin/0000-0002-3896-1777; Ma, Xiaolin/0000-0002-5073-418X; Dupont-Nivet, Guillaume/0000-0001-9905-9739; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				NOV	2020	210								103354	10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103354													WOS:000588283400021

Changes in mid-summer water temperature and clarity across the Great Lakes between 1968 and 2002	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent decades, three important events have likely played a role in changing the water temperature and clarity of the Laurentian Great Lakes: 1) warmer climate, 2) reduced phosphorus loading, and 3) invasion by European Dreissenid mussels. This paper compiled environmental data from government agencies monitoring the middle and lower portions of the Great Lakes basin (lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario) to document changes in aquatic environments between 1968 and 2002. Over this 34-year period, mean annual air temperature increased at an average rate of 0.037 degrees C/y, resulting in a 1.3 degrees C increase. Surface water temperature during August has been rising at annual rates of 0.084 degrees C (Lake Huron) and 0.048 degrees C (Lake Ontario) resulting in increases of 2.9 degrees C and 1.6 degrees C, respectively. In Lake Erie, the trend was also positive, but it was smaller and not significant. Water clarity, measured here by August Secchi depth, increased in all lakes. Secchi depth increased 1.7 m in Lake Huron, 3.1 m in Lake Ontario and 2.4 m in Lake Erie. Prior to the invasion of Dreissenid mussels, increases in Secchi depth were significant (p<0.05) in lakes Erie and Ontario, suggesting that phosphorus abatement aided water clarity. After Dreissenid mussel invasion, significant increases in Secchi depth were detected in lakes Ontario and Huron. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Olding, DD; Hellebust, JA; Douglas, MSV				Olding, DD; Hellebust, JA; Douglas, MSV			Phytoplankton community composition in relation to water quality and water-body morphometry in urban lakes, reservoirs, and ponds	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Distinct differences in observed summer phytoplankton communities in relation to maximum depth suggest that constraints posed by water-body morphometry may modify the trophic control of phytoplankton-community composition and structure in urban water bodies. In deep urban sites (Z(max) greater than or equal to = 5 m), phytoplankton communities tended to be predictably related to trophic status (i.e., increases in trophy were associated with increased cyanobacterial dominance, a decreased proportion of Chrysophyceae-Synurophyceae and grazable-size algae, and a decrease in community richness), although exceptions existed, owing to factors such as human intervention, age of the water body, and flushing rates. In contrast, in shallow urban water bodies (Z(max) < 5 m), trophic status was a poor predictor of phytoplankton communities. Across meso- to hyper-eutrophic conditions, shallow urban sites were rarely dominated by cyanobacteria and, when they were, the species composition differed from nutrient-rich deep urban sites. The key requirement for cyanobacterial dominance in shallow urban sites appears to be sufficiently long water residence times, viz., greater than 8-14 days. Further study should describe how the relationship between water body residence time and species-generation time may limit the development of specific nuisance algal species, aiding in the management and rehabilitation of urban water bodies.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2000	57	10					2163	2174		10.1139/cjfas-57-10-2163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-10-2163													WOS:000165188300020
J	Zhong, X; Guidoni, B; Jacas, L; Jacquet, S				Zhong, Xu; Guidoni, Baptiste; Jacas, Louis; Jacquet, Stephan			Structure and diversity of ssDNA Microviridae viruses in two peri-alpine lakes (Annecy and Bourget, France)	RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY												Microviridae is a subset of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses infecting bacteria. This group of phages has been previously observed to be very abundant (representing >90% of the total known viral metagenomic sequences) in Lake Bourget. However, this observation was made only during one period (in summer) and from a single sample collected at a single depth (near surface). This result suggests the importance of these viruses, poorly examined thus far, especially in fresh waters. In this study, performed on the two largest natural lakes in France (e.g. Lakes Annecy and Bourget), Microviridae structure was determined each month throughout the year (2011) using PCR-DGGE, with primers that target the major-capsid-protein-encoding gene VP1; cloning/sequencing was used to investigate their diversity. Our results confirm that Microviridae are diverse in peri-alpine lakes and are mainly represented by gokushoviruses. We also found for the first time ssDNA viruses belonging to Alpavirinae, another subfamily within Microviridae recently proposed by Krupovic and Forterre (2011), generally prophages infecting members of the Phylum Bacteroidetes. Our data also support highly variable community composition and dynamics of individual components whose patterns were different between lakes, suggesting distinct host communities and/or abiotic influences between the two ecosystems. We point out that most of the major observed ssDNA Microviridae viruses display boom-bust patterns (with a sharp increase/decline) in their dynamics, with high relative abundances, suggesting brutal control of hosts and rapid regulation of the host community structure.

Objective: We wanted to evaluate the clinical benefits of rehabilitation using natural factors (climate, sapropelic mud, salty water of the lake), applied to patients with spine cord injury. Material and method: We studied ( retrospective) patients with spine cord injury at first presentation in Techirghiol health resort, hospitalized from June, 1st 2007 to June, 1st, 2008, undergoing specific rehabilitation treatment and evaluated the clinical benefits of balneal treatment. Results: The first traumatic condition was fall down (37%), and the second car accident(14,4%). The most of them (84%) use wheelchair as support of travel and 30% needs accompaning standing. We noticed after the treatment improvement of muscle activity (both: spastic and flaccid) and psychological and muscle relaxation. Conclusions: Adequate administration of natural factors corroborate with progressive intensity of kinetotherapy or hydro-kineto-therapy completed with electrotherapy and massage lead to improvement of scores of patient. Quality of life of patients can increases in many ways: self esteem, interest for treatment, encouraging other patients, implication in family life and finding new means of support for travel and self assistance.					; MInea, Mihaela/AAT-9542-2020; Surdu, Olga/AAT-7963-2020; Surdu, Traian/AAT-9871-2020	Surdu, Olga/0000-0002-1288-2720; Surdu, Traian/0000-0002-7370-9489															978-0-7695-3753-5				2009							64	+		10.1109/AT-EQUAL.2009.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AT-EQUAL.2009.23													WOS:000273611600018

The meres have generally high total phosphorus concentrations and this may be a natural phenomenon dependent on the local geochemistry. Some anthropogenic eutrophication has occurred, however, and from a chain of three meres, sewage effluent was diverted in 1991. The upper lake, Mere Mere, lying above the point of discharge, has not changed in any systematic way since effluent diversion. The middle lake, the very shallow Little Mere, has changed markedly in water chemistry but not fundamentally in ecosystem structure. It was and remains a clear-water, macrophyte dominated lake. The third lake, the deep Rostherne Mere, has shown no response in chlorophyll a concentrations in four years since effluent diversion though in the past two years there appears to be a downward trend in total phosphorus. The reasons for this are explored in terms of our understanding of lake eutrophication. Comparisons are made with White Mere, a deep groundwater fed lake with a long retention time and a very high total phosphorus concentration. The deep meres may add a new dimension to our understanding of natural and anthropogenic eutrophication.

J	Mann, TJ				Mann, Thomas J.			Springtime in Flintown: Disappointment, Affront, and Failure	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE												Looking back, the beginning of the Flint water crisis seems surreal. Through a series of wrongheadedly antidemocratic and uncritical economic belt-tightening policies, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, along with the Flint city manager (and some city officials) decided to switch the water supply from Lake Huronthrough Detroitto the Flint River. For those of us living, working, or studying in Flint, we knew such a decision seemed odd, for we knew that the Flint River was, at best, dirty, and more realistically, dangerous. Nevertheless, in the Spring of 2013, governmental officials decided that changing the water supply made the most sense financially. Almost immediately, residents complained of skin irritation, body aches and pains, the bad smell and taste of the water, and so on. City officials told residents that despite the telling signs to the contrary, the water was safe to drink. Finally, a year after the decision was made, the new mayor declared a state of emergency. The truth of the situation finally was revealed: the state government seemed to have hidden life-altering information from the public. The water was toxic, and nobody was told. This article will explore the city's social, economic, and political history and how it relates to the Flint water crisis. I shall use Bill Lawson's notion of social disappointment to describe the general history of Flint in the past 50 or so years and then explain why the Flint water crisis is best described as an affront within the context of social disappointment.																			1939-4071	1937-5174				JUN	2016	9	3					65	68		10.1089/env.2016.0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/env.2016.0005													WOS:000379436700001
J	Winter, TC; Rosenberry, DO				Winter, TC; Rosenberry, DO			Hydrology of prairie pothole wetlands during drought and deluge: A 17-year study of the cottonwood lake wetland complex in North Dakota in the perspective of longer term measured and proxy hydrological records	CLIMATIC CHANGE												From 1988 to 1992 the north-central plains of North America had a drought that was followed by a wet period that continues to the present (1997). Data on the hydrology of the Cottonwood Lake area (CWLA) collected for nearly 10 years before, and during, the recent dry and wet periods indicate that some prairie pothole wetlands served only a recharge function under all climate conditions. Transpiration from groundwater around the perimeter of groundwater discharge wetlands drew water from the wetlands by the end of summer, even during very wet years. Long-term records of a climate index (Palmer Drought Severity Index), stream discharge (Pembina River), and lake level (Devils Lake) were used to put the 17-year CWLA record into a longer term perspective. In addition, proxy records of climate determined from fossils in the sediments of Devils Lake were also used. These data indicate that the drought of 1988-92 may have been the second worst of the 20th century, but that droughts of that magnitude, and worse, were common during the past 500 years. In contrast, the present wet period may be the wettest it has been during the past 130 years, or possibly the past 500 years.					; Rosenberry, Donald/C-2241-2013	Rosenberry, Donald/0000-0003-0681-5641; 													0165-0009					OCT	1998	40	2					189	209		10.1023/A:1005448416571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005448416571													WOS:000076637300003

Prior to the commencement of artificial aeration, it was characterized by thermal stratification which usually began in May or June and became complete during July or August. Pre-destratification studies of periphytic algal communities were begun in 1985 and continued through two artificial aeration seasons in 1987 and 1988. Changes in cell density were used in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the artificial destratification system in increasing periphytic algal population size within the upper lake stratum. An increase in cell density within this stratum was interpreted as resulting from a movement to and colonization within the preferred photic zone for most algae. Colonization by periphytic algae generally followed species-specific sinking rates predicted for phytoplankton. During the pre-destratification period, green algae comprised two percent of the total cell density of the upper lake zone. This was increased to thirteen percent following artificial destratification during the spring of 1988. When diatom composition of the water column was compared for the pre- and post-destratification sessons, mean cell densities were found to be 31 and 28 percent, respectively. This suggested a low mixing intensity of the artificial aeration system. Artificial aeration was found to select against flagellates which exploit specialized microhabitats or exclusive resources. A shift in dominance occurred replacing diatoms during pre-destratification years with blue-green algae after the onset of artificial aeration. This suggested that while certain conditions favored colonization by a few genera of periphyton, all genera within the group not similarly affected. Using step-wise discriminant analysis, ten mensurational variables were analyzed for the upper, middle, and lower zones of the water column. The results indicated the effectiveness of the artificial destratification system in producing homogenous periphytic algal habitats in 1988.																			0003-9136					FEB	1992	123	4					497	511																WOS:A1992HE51200009

Dissolved molecular oxygen (DO) in lakes can inhibit the production of CH4 and promote CH4 oxidation. DO is therefore often considered an important regulator of CH4 emissions from lakes. Presence or absence of DO in the water above the sediments can affect CH4 production and emissions by (a) influencing if methane production can be fueled by the most reactive organic matter in the top sediment layer or rely on deeper and less degradable organic matter, and (b) enabling CH4 accumulation in deep waters and potentially large emissions upon water column turnover. However, the relative importance of these two DO effects on CH4 fluxes is still unclear. We assessed CH4 fluxes from two connected lake basins in northern boreal Sweden where one was experimentally oxygenated. Results showed no clear difference in summer CH4 emissions attributable to water column DO concentrations. Large amounts of CH4 accumulated in the anoxic hypolimnion of the reference basin but little of this may have been emitted because of incomplete mixing, and effective methane oxidation of stored CH4 reaching oxic water layers. Accordingly, <= 24% of the stored CH4 was likely emitted in the experimental lake. Overall, our results suggest that hypolimnetic DO and water column CH4 storage might have a smaller impact on CH4 emissions in boreal forest lakes than previous estimates, yet potential fluxes associated with water column turnover events remain a significant uncertainty in lake CH4 emission estimates.

J	Scott, L				Scott, L			Vegetation history and climate in the Savanna biome South Africa since 190,000 ka: a comparison of pollen data from the Tswaing Crater (the Pretoria Saltpan) and Wonderkrater	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The long-term Quaternary vegetation and climate history in South Africa's savanna biome since ca. 190,000 yr BP, is elucidated by the palynological record of lake sediments in the Tswaing Crater (the Pretoria Saltpan), and spring deposits from Wonderkrater, despite hiatuses in both sequences. Palaeotemperature trends from the two places are presented by means of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of pollen data, allowing a new regional palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Correlation in the older sections of the sequences, beyond radiocarbon dating, is tentative, suggesting that the Wonderkrater sequence is roughly 4 times younger than the Tswaing sequence. Combined, temperature indications from the two sites suggest cooling at ca. 14,000 yr BP and slight warming at ca. 15,000 yr BP. Although no data are available between ca. 15,000 and 21,000, and 25,000 and 31,000 yr BP, generally cool conditions are suggested between ca. 11,000 and 33,000 yr BP. Between ca. 33,000 and an extrapolated age of ca. 80,000 yr BP, at least three warmer pulses of varying intensity occurred. No data are available between ca. 80,000 and 150,000 yr, but between 150,000 and ca. 190,000 yr BP, two cool and two moderately warm phases are suggested.

We have examined temporal variations in radiocarbon marine reservoir ages (R) and regional marine reservoir corrections (Delta R) of the SCS during the Holocene using paired measurements of AMS C-14 and TIMS Th-230 on 20 pristine corals. The results show large fluctuations in both R and Delta R values over the past 7500 years (yrs) with two distinct plateaus during 7.5-5.6 and 3.5-2.5 thousand calendar years before present (cal ka BP). The respective weighted mean Delta R values of these plateaus are 151 +/- 85 and 89 +/- 59 yrs, which are significantly higher than its modern value of -23 +/- 52 yrs. This suggests that using a constant modern Delta R value to calibrate C-14 dates of the SCS marine samples will introduce additional errors to the calibrated ages. Our results provide the first database for the Holocene R and Delta R values of the SCS for improved radiocarbon calibration of marine samples. We interpret the two Delta R plateaus as being related to two intervals with weakened El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and intensified East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). This is because the C-14 content of the SCS surface water is controlled by both the C-14 concentration of the Pacific North Equatorial Current (NEC) which is in turn influenced by ENSO-induced upwelling along the Pacific equator and vertical upwelling within the SCS as a result of moisture transportation to midlatitude region to supply the EASM rainfall.					fink, David/A-9518-2012; Barbetti, Matteo/AAX-7707-2021; fink, david/A-9518-2012; Zhao, Jian-xin/A-5938-2008; Hua, Quan/F-9593-2014	fink, david/0000-0001-7156-4602; Zhao, Jian-xin/0000-0002-2413-6178; Yu, Kefu/0000-0001-7082-1822; 													0883-8305	1944-9186				JUL 27	2010	25								PA3205	10.1029/2009PA001831	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009PA001831													WOS:000280590400001
J	Bowles, KC; Apte, SC; Maher, WA; Blühdorn, DR				Bowles, KC; Apte, SC; Maher, WA; Blühdorn, DR			Mercury cycling in Lake Gordon and Lake Pedder, Tasmania (Australia).: I:: In-lake processes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The processes affecting the concentrations of total mercury ( total Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a freshwater system comprising two connected reservoirs in southwest Tasmania were investigated. Surface concentrations of total mercury (total Hg) were temporally and spatially uniform in both Lake Gordon (2.3 +/- 0.4 ng L-1, n = 27) and Lake Pedder (2.3 +/- 0.3 ng L-1, n = 11). The surface concentrations of MeHg in Lake Gordon (0.35 +/- 0.39 ng L-1, n = 25) were more variable than total Hg and MeHg typically comprised 10-20% of total Hg. The relatively high amount of total mercury present as MeHg in Lake Gordon was attributed to the high proportion of wetlands in the upper catchment (50% of total area) and in-lake contributions (ca. 40% of total MeHg). Despite the close proximity of the two lakes, MeHg concentrations in Lake Pedder were consistently lower than in Lake Gordon. This phenomenon can be explained in part by the greater contribution of direct rainfall to Lake Pedder leading to the dilution of MeHg. Water column MeHg concentrations were higher in warmer months in both lakes, reflecting increased net methylation of inorganic mercury. Unlike previous studies of seasonally anoxic lakes, depth profiles of total mercury and MeHg in Lake Gordon were uniform and were not affected by water column stratification occurring in the summer months, and oxygen depletion with depth. This suggests that redox cycling and accumulation of MeHg in the hypolimnion following seasonally-induced anoxia is not a significant part of the mercury cycle in Lake Gordon. The primary location of MeHg production within the lake's water column is not conspicuous. Mercury speciation measurements made above and below the lake system over a period of 19 months indicates that after 20 yr of impoundment, the reservoirs are not significantly affecting MeHg concentrations in the downstream riverine environment.

(Quadrigyridae) from Labeo cylindricus Peters, 1852 (Cyprinidae)	JOURNAL OF THE HELMINTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Two species of acanthocephalans are reported from fishes collected during the summer of 1996 in the southeast arm of Lake Malawi (Lake Nyasa), East Africa. The common Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae (Baylis, 1948) had infected 18 cichlid and 1 bagrid host species tall new host records) netted by divers wearing scuba gear around Harbor Island or caught by hook and line in deep water. The specimens of this parasite were some of the smallest ever reported for that species. Two males of a new species, Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) malawiensis, are described from 2 male Labeo cylindricus (Cyprinidae). This is the fifth species of this genus and subgenus described in Africa. It is distinguished from the other 4 African and 33 mostly Asian species in that the proboscis hooks of the middle circle are longer than those of the anterior circle. The new species further differs from the other African species in proboscis and hook size, posterior hook root, trunk spination, and lemniscal form. Observations on host and geographical distribution, prevalence, and developmental stages of A. (A.) tilapiae an also reported.																			1049-233X					JAN	1999	66	1					47	55																WOS:000078780300010

We were able to distinguish three main phases: The lake was mesotrophic prior to the 1830s with an oxic hypolimnion. From the early 19th century on, delta C-13 of organic matter indicates that primary productivity starts to increase slowly. Between the 1830s and 1872, the lake went through a transition towards eutrophy. Low calcite contents in the homogeneous sediment are caused by dissolution connected to increasing primary productivity and growing importance of decomposition processes. After 1873, and accelerated since 1963, Sacrower See is characterised by growing nutrient input, and thus further increasing primary productivity. The lake is eutrophic, and decomposition of organic matter causes high oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion, which becomes regularly anoxic during thermal summer stratification. Biogenic varves are preserved in the sediment, characterised by layers of autochthonous, biochemically precipitated calcite crystals. In this study, we were able to demonstrate that Sacrower See is an example of exceptional slow increase of anthropogenically enhanced nutrient input, and of the imprint which these processes have on sediments of a hardwater lake.					; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019	Luder, Britta/0000-0002-6137-1855; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAY	2006	35	4					897	912		10.1007/s10933-005-6188-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-6188-5													WOS:000238714100014

Evidence for free-living Bacteroides in Cladophora along the shores of the Great Lakes	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacteroides is assumed to be restricted to the alimentary canal of animals and humans and is considered to be non-viable in ambient environments. We hypothesized that Bacteroides could persist and replicate within beach-stranded Cladophora glomerata mats in southern Lake Michigan, USA. Mean Bacteroides concentration (per GenBac3 Taqman quantitative PCR assay) during summer 2012 at Jeorse Park Beach was 5.2 log calibrator cell equivalents (CCE) g(-1) dry weight (dw), ranging from 3.7 to 6.7. We monitored a single beach-stranded mat for 3 wk; bacterial concentrations increased by 1.6 log CCE g(-1) dw and correlated significantly with ambient temperature (p = 0.003). Clonal growth was evident, as observed by > 99% nucleotide sequence similarity among clones. In in vitro studies, Bacteroides concentrations increased by 5.5 log CCE g(-1) after 7 d (27 degrees C) in fresh Cladophora collected from rocks. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of 36 clones from the incubation experiment showed highly similar genotypes (>= 97% sequence overlap). The closest enteric Bacteroides spp. from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were only 87 to 91% similar. Genomic similarity, clonality, growth, and persistence collectively suggest that putative, free-living Bacteroides inhabit Cladophora mats of southern Lake Michigan. These findings may have important biological, medical, regulatory, microbial source tracking, and public health implications.

PRYMNESIUM PARVUM POPULATION DYNAMICS DURING BLOOM DEVELOPMENT: A ROLE ASSESSMENT OF GRAZERS AND VIRUS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum is a harmful alga known to cause fish-killing blooms that occur worldwide. In Texas (United States), P. parvum blooms occur in inland brackish water bodies and have increased in frequency and magnitude in recent years. In this study we conducted three consecutive field experiments (Lake Whitney) to investigate the influence of zooplankton and viruses on P. parvum bloom dynamics during the time of year when blooms are still typically active in Texas (early spring). A localized P. parvum bloom developed during our study that involved increasing levels of toxicity (based on Pimephales promelas and Daphnia magna bioassays). Only in our last experiment, during later stages of bloom development and under highly toxic conditions, did the presence of grazers show a statistically significant, negative effect on P. parvum population dynamics. During this experiment, a rotifer-dominated zooplankton community emerged, composed mostly of Notholca laurentiae, suggesting that this species was less sensitive than other grazers to toxins produced by P. parvum. Microzooplankton may have also been important at this time. Similarly, only our final experiment demonstrated a statistically significant, negative effect of viruses on P. parvum. This exploratory study, resulting in observed impacts on P. parvum populations by both grazers and virus, enhances our understanding of P. parvum ecology and highlights direction for future studies on resistance of zooplankton to prymnesin toxins and algal-virus interactions.

Spatial variation of nutrient balance in the Truckee River, California-Nevada	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Because the Truckee River connects two lakes along the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains with different limiting nutrients, this research addresses whether the nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) balance of the river ecosystem changes longitudinally. Historical (1990 to 2000) total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) ratios in river water exhibited the expected gradient from high N:P ratios upstream to low N:P ratios downstream, with the major gradient of the NT balance occurring within the transition between montane and high desert terrain. During 2001, the river contained anomalously low total nitrogen concentrations in the far upper reaches and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the lower reaches, resulting in a less apparent longitudinal gradient of NT ratios. Measurements of periphyton growth and physiology (nutrient bioassays and ectoenzyme activities) and stoichiometry during the summer of 2001 also exhibited a complex picture of the spatial variation of N:P balance that was not entirely consistent with a strong N:P gradient. However, the compendium of the indicators did support the overall picture of an overarching longitudinal gradient from high to low N:P ratios. The results suggest that periphyton management efforts in the Truckee River should consider the overall spatial gradient as well as the small-scale dynamics of the stream ecosystem structure.					, Mark/HTN-3821-2023	Green, Mark/0000-0002-7415-7209													1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2006	42	3					659	674		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04483.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2006.tb04483.x													WOS:000238738300009

Extremely high pollutant concentrations were recorded. Most of the limit, target and threshold values set by the European Union for the protection of human health were exceeded. PM10 and PM2.5 concentration levels in particular were very high; the annual means were 85 and 56 mu g/m(3), respectively. The PM levels were among the highest in Europe. The most serious pollution episodes occurred during winter months. During pollution episodes, high atmospheric stability prevailed over large areas, and during the daytime, the mixing layer typically was only 700-900 m high. In these circumstances, the mountains surrounding the city of Skopje trapped the pollution inside the valley extremely effectively. As a result, an extremely homogenous pollution field (both spatially and by components) formed in the Skopje Valley. The highest hourly PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations during the episodes were 800 and 500 mu g/m(3), respectively, whereas the NO2 concentration was 440 mu g/m(3). The pollutant concentrations were much lower in summertime (except for ozone). Local emissions and atmospheric chemistry as well as the diurnal cycle of the mixing height controlled the concentrations levels of the photochemically active gases NOx, CO, benzene and O-3. PM concentrations were further elevated by regional wildfire emissions. The extremely high pollutant concentrations mostly originated from local emissions and were enhanced by the local topography together with poor atmospheric mixing conditions.

J	Oliva, M; Gómez-Ortiz, A				Oliva, Marc; Gomez-Ortiz, A.			Late-Holocene environmental dynamics and climate variability in a Mediterranean high mountain environment (Sierra Nevada, Spain) inferred from lake sediments and historical sources	HOLOCENE												Landscape dynamics in the periglacial belt of a high mountain Mediterranean environment is a process of rapid evolution but complex reconstruction. Following this purpose, in this paper we discuss data from two sources concerning the past evolution of the present-day periglacial environment in the Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula): mountain lake sediments and documentary sources. La Mosca lake sedimentary record provides information about the palaeocological evolution in the MulhacSn cirque over the last three millennia, while documentary sources enable us to reconstruct the landscape evolution in the high lands of this massif over the last eight centuries. During the late Holocene cold and wet phases have favoured the activity of geomorphic processes, with ephemeral development of glaciers in the highest northern cirques, abundance of late-lying snow patches and a decrease of the vegetation cover in the highest catchments. By contrast, warm periods have been more conducive to geomorphic stability, with an extension of the vegetation grass cover, but without glaciers and with a lower density of snow patches in summer. The comparison of the palaeocological evolution and associated palaeoclimatic conditions in the Sierra Nevada with other regional proxies shows evidence of the moderate sensitivity of the geomorphological processes occurring in the massif during the late Holocene with respect to the climate variability prevailing in the Iberian Peninsula and neighbouring areas. According to lake sedimentary records, the 'Little Ice Age' has been the coldest period during the late Holocene. Historical sources suggest a temperature increase of 0.93 degrees C since the middle of the 19th century.

A better understanding of past vegetation dynamics is necessary to disentangle the influence of different forcing factors and assess future vege-tation change. Here we present the first multi-proxy palaeoecological study combining sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), pollen, spores, stomata, charcoal and plant macrofossils from the Alps. We reconstructed the Holocene vegetation dynamics and fire history at Lago Inferiore del Sangiatto (1980 m asl), a small lake in the subalpine belt of the Ossola region, Italian Lepontine Alps. Afforestation in response to climate warming started at 10,700 cal yr BP with Larix decidua and tree Betula, which formed open forests together with Pinus cembra from 10,500 cal yr BP onwards. Human impact on the regional vegetation started at 5100 cal yr BP, resulting in expansions of Picea abies and Alnus viridis and the collapse of Abies alba. Species response models and ordination analysis show that livestock grazing and fire were major drivers of vegetation change at Lago Inferiore del Sangiatto during the late Holocene. Finally, increasing human impact during the Bronze (ca. 4200-2900 cal yr BP) and Iron Age (ca. 2900-2000 cal yr BP) led to the formation of species-rich larch meadows and alpine pastures that are still dominant today. The palaeoecological data suggest that under projected climate change and land abandonment, the treeline ecotone will likely shift to higher altitudes, leading to important changes in species composition and increasing the risk of biodiversity loss.

In these environments, calcite precipitates display an extraordinary morphological diversity, from single crystal rhombohedral prisms, to blocky crystalline encrustations, or spherulitic to dendritic aggregates. Despite many decades of thorough descriptive and interpretative work on these fabrics, relating calcite micro-morphology with sedimentary hydrogeochemical conditions remains a challenge. Environmental interpretations have been hampered by the fact that calcite morphogenesis results from the complex interaction between different physico-chemical parameters which often act simultaneously (e.g., carbonate mineral supersaturation, Mg/Ca ratio of the parental fluid, organic and inorganic additives). To try to experimentally address the sedimentological causes of calcite morphogenesis, an experimental approach yielding a first attempt at a calcite growth-form phase diagram is presented here. The initial aim was to account for the carbonate products experimentally nucleated in alkaline, saline lake settings. These are the result of at least two competing calcite precipitation 'driving forces' that affect morphogenesis: the calcite supersaturation level of the parental fluid, and the concentration of microbial-derived organic molecules (alginic acid). A key finding of this study is that common naturally-occurring calcite products such as calcite floating rafts, rhombohedral prismatic forms, di-pyramid calcite crystals, spherulitic calcite grains, or vertically stacked spheroidal calcite aggregates, can be related to specific hydrogeochemical contexts, and their physical transitions pinpointed in a phase diagram. By exploring binary or ternary responses to forcing in morphological phase-space, links between calcite growth forms and (palaeo)environmental conditions can be determined. This provides a truly process-oriented means of navigating questions around carbonate precipitate morphogenesis for the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Volkova, NI				Volkova, NI			Geochemistry of rare elements in waters and sediments of alkaline lakes in the Sasykkul depression, East Pamirs	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The saline lakes (Tuzkul, Chukurkul, Sasykkul Lakes) of the Sasykkul depression located in the semidesert part of the Pamirs provide a prominent example of the evaporative concentration of alkaline waters in a closed basin under arid climate conditions. Chemical evolution of the lake waters has resulted in the development of residual Na-Cl-CO3-SO4 and Na-Cl-CO3 brines. The contents of a number of rare elements were determined in waters and sediments of the Sasykkul depression lakes. Speciation modelling suggests that the main aqueous species of Ag are chloride complexes, Cu, ph, Zn, Mn are carbonate complexes, Be, Bi, Nb are hydroxocomplexes, Mo, W, As, V are oxyanions. It was established that the salt lake sediments are significantly enriched in B, Ba, Mo, W, U, Th. High contents of trace elements are considered to be due to chemical weathering of rocks within the catchment basin, significant contribution from thermal springs derived from the residual fluids associated with acid igneous and volcanic rocks, and following evapoconcentration in a closed basin. The processes of evaporative concentration, solution complexation, chemical precipitation, and water-sediment interaction lead to the partitioning of trace metals in the salt sediments.

J	GIBSON, F				GIBSON, F			ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF TIME BUDGET OF AMERICAN AVOCET	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												During the 1969 breeding season (April-July) 422 h of time-budget data were collected on 36 American avocets (Recurvirostra americana) in an alkaline marsh at Summer Lake, Oregon [USA]. Time-budget data were collected by recording at 10 s intervals the time spent in 12 categories of behavior through 4 stages of the breeding cycle: prenesting, incubation, parental care and postbreeding. Data were also recorded for six 2 h periods from 0600-1800. Seasonally, all maintenance activities combined took 76% of the avocet''s time, and reproductive activities took 26%. Of all activities, feeding took the largest portion of time (36%). Because of its close relationship to bioenergetics, feeding is probably one of the most important aspects of the time budget. Through the breeding season energy requirements change, and this is reflected in a seasonal flux in time spent feeding. Seasonal variation in temperature, activity levels, prey abundance, and such energetically expensive processes as egg production, molting and premigratory fat deposition may determine the amount of time spent in resting, preening or in aggressive activities. Incubation and caring for the young required similar amounts of time. Diurnally, several categories of behavior, such as feeding, preening and nest-building, exhibited morning and afternoon activity peaks, separated by a period of inactivity at midmorning. This pattern held when all active action patterns were combined. Foraging patterns largely dictate the form of the diurnal activity pattern. The morning feeding peak may be related to a need to feed after the nightlong fast; the afternoon peak is perhaps associated with optimum environmental conditions for feeding, such as maximum insect availability. Avocet males and females exhibited few significant differences in either the seasonal or diurnal time budgets. Males appeared to be more aggressive; females spent more time incubating. The general similarities of morphology, behavior and temporal organization of behavior indicate that the sexes have similar roles in the social system and may also be ecologically similar.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1978	99	1					65	82		10.2307/2424934	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424934													WOS:A1978EV04600006

In these environments picoplankton constitute a key component of the food webs. We compared lakes with different regimes (clear vegetated and turbid), in periods with contrasting hydrological conditions. Samplings were conducted during late summer in 2015 (higher water levels), 2016 and 2017 (lower water levels). In each lake we measured limnological variables and quantified picoplankton by flow cytometry. Differences in picoplankton structure among lakes were associated with their regime and hydrological conditions. We found higher abundances of heterotrophic bacterioplankton (HB) in more turbid and eutrophic lakes; these lakes also showed higher abundances of both bacterial fractions analyzed (high and low nucleic-acid content). Clear vegetated oligotrophic lakes showed the lowest photosynthetic picoplankton abundances and higher densities of PE-rich picocyanobacteria (Pcy). All lakes presented PE-rich cells and picoeukaryotes (Peuk), the latter being the most frequent group in all the environments and the most abundant in turbid ones. PC-rich Pcy appeared only in clear vegetated, organic turbid and inorganic turbid, showing one or two cytometric populations. Clear vegetated lakes with water level reduction show an increase of HB, PC-rich cells and Peuk abundances. We provided evidences that picoplankton structure is influenced by lake regime, and in some lakes the shift from clear vegetated to turbid states strongly affects the structure of these communities.

Nutrient enrichment and selective predation by zooplankton promote Microcystis (Cyanobacteria) bloom formation	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												An experiment was conducted with a natural freshwater phytoplankton community from a eutrophic pond to investigate the combined effects of phytoplankton community competitive interactions, nutrient enrichment and zooplankton on Microcystis bloom formation. The pond water initially had a very low concentration of Microcystis, but the total phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a reached similar to 110 mu g L-1 in summer. The pond water was incubated outdoors at natural temperature and light with a 2 x 2 factorial manipulation of nutrient (nutrient additions versus no additions) with and without zooplankton. The interaction of a two-phase nutrient addition (a net increase in concentrations of 250.0 mu M N and 16.1 mu M P each time) and the presence of zooplankton significantly altered phytoplankton community composition. When the water initially contained zooplankton, nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment promoted a surface Microcystis bloom. However, when the zooplankton was removed from the water at the start of the experiment, no surface Microcystis bloom formed, regardless of nutrient additions. Chlorophyta dominated in the absence of zooplankton, when the same nutrient was provided. Our results demonstrate that Microcystis bloom formation in this eutrophic water body at a mean temperature of about 36 degrees C at 14:00 h was closely related to the initial presence of zooplankton and a sufficient supply of nitrogen and phosphorus. We believe this is one of the first demonstrations of zooplankton controlling Microcystis bloom formation in a water body previously free of surface cyanobacterial blooms.

A methodology using a combination of continuous water level monitoring and high resolution topographic surveying was used to develop a detailed hydrological model of the karst network, from which water levels at any point within the turloughs can be defined at any time during the 28-year period (1989 to 2017). The flood conditions experienced across the spatial distributions for different vegetation communities (as mapped by a field survey) have then been collated and presented as statistical distributions for flood duration, flood depth, flood frequency and mean temperature/global radiation at the time of year in spring when the flood waters start to recede. Analysis of these four turloughs has revealed distinct differences between vegetation communities, from Eleocharis acicularis communities at the turlough base typically experiencing 6 to 7 months of inundation per year compared to the limestone pavement community at the top fringes of the turloughs only flooded from 1 to 2 months per year. An approach that used Sentinel-2 satellite data to provide an assessment of whether there have been changes in the spatial distribution of the communities is also presented. Such metrics can be evaluated alongside other variables such as water quality (particularly nutrients), soil type and land-use, in order to understand the habitat requirements for such plant communities and their associated ecological systems.					; Bhatnagar, Saheba/AAU-1791-2021; Gill, Laurence/D-2592-2014; Morrissey, Patrick/HTN-8292-2023	Morrissey, Patrick/0000-0002-0846-6863; Naughton, Owen/0000-0001-9616-0022; Gill, Laurence/0000-0002-1599-1105; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				SEP	2021	14	6							e2316	10.1002/eco.2316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2316		JUL 2021											WOS:000670526700001

Long-term Trends in the Number of Monarch Butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) Counted on Fall Migration at Long Point, Ontario, Canada (1995-2014)	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												In Canada, the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), is designated a species of "special concern." During their southward journey each year, hundreds of thousands of monarchs funnel through Long Point, Lake Erie in Canada. Standardized daily counts of migrating monarchs have been conducted at two sites on Long Point for 20 consecutive years (1995-2014). Using a Bayesian framework, we estimated long-term trends in the number of migrants passing through Long Point. Over the 20-yr period, credible intervals for trends estimated at each site overlapped, with an estimated decline of 5.11%yr(-1) across sites. However, trajectories differed between sites. At the more inland site, a more constant 7.78%yr(-1) decline was detected, but at the tip of the peninsula, counts increased by 10.04%yr(-1) from 1995-2005, followed by a decline of 11.9%yr(-1) from 2004-2014. This resulted in an estimated 20-yr decline of 2.74%yr(-1) at this site. Lower and less variable counts since 2010 appear to be driving the apparent long-term population declines. Relative to the tip site, counts from the more inland site are less likely to be biased by large accumulations of monarchs blown off-course during headwinds or stopping over to replenish fuel supplies. Trends from the more inland site also show strong correspondence with declines in egg production and milkweed abundance in the upper Midwest, which suggests that the number of individuals counted on migration is evidence of a potentially broader-scale condition. Additional years of data should be collected to determine whether the apparent decline will continue.																			0013-8746	1938-2901				SEP	2015	108	5					707	717		10.1093/aesa/sav041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/sav041													WOS:000362041900007

Post-translocation movements and ranging behaviour of roroa (great spotted kiwi, Apteryx maxima)	NOTORNIS												Translocations are increasingly used in kiwi (Apteryx spp.) conservation management, and their outcome is largely influenced by post-release dispersal and survival. A translocation of roroa (great spotted kiwi, A. maxima) to the Nina Valley, near Lake Summer Forest Park, is the first reintroduction of the Arthur's Pass roroa population. In 2015, eight wild-caught adults were translocated from Arthur's Pass National Park, following the release of ten captive-hatched subadults during 2011-13. We monitored the translocated kiwi by radio telemetry during 2015-17. Dispersal was highly variable among the released wild birds. The straight-line distance from the release site to the last recorded location ranged 0.5-10.3 km. Seven of the wild birds remained in the Nina Valley and covered an area up to 1,700 ha (95% utilisation distribution). Releasing the wild birds had no measurable impact on the ranging behaviour of previously released subadults. The current population founder group comprises a maximum of 13 unrelated individuals, and therefore further releases are necessary for a genetically viable population. Additionally, expansion of the pest-controlled area is crucial for the long-term persistence of the reintroduced population in the Nina Valley.

These families are Centropagidae, Temoridae, Pseudodiaptomidae and Diaptomidae. The genera Leptodiaptomus and Mastigodiaptomus are the most speciose diaptomid genera in Mexico, and they inhabit natural and artificial lakes, ephemeral ponds, springs, and caverns. Leptodiaptomus is considered as an endemic Nearctic genus, whereas Mastigodiaptomus is a widely distributed Neotropical genus in the southern USA, Mexico, the Caribbean Islands and Central America. Based on new and recent evidence, Mastigodiaptomus diversity has been underestimated: six species of the genus were known before 2000. In this work three new Mastigodiaptomus species have been described from different regions of Mexico by using integrative taxonomy. We also gave amended diagnosis of M. nesus Bowman (1986) and M. patzcuarensis s. str. (Kiefer, 1938). Methods: In this work, the taxonomic status of the species was clarified using modern, integrative method based on the COI gene as a DNA marker, plus micro-structural analysis (based on SEM and ligth microscopy). Results: Three new species of Mastigodiaptomus were described based on genetic and morphological analyses: M. alexei sp. n., M. ha sp. n. and M. cihuatlan sp. n. Also amended description of M. nesus, morphological variation of M. patzcuarensis s. str., and a comparison of them with all known sequences within the genus are provided. These new findings show that in Mastigodiaptomus differences in several cuticular microstructures of several appendages (such as the antennules, the fifth legs, or the urosomites of these copepods) agree with the interspecific genetic divergence >3% observed in sequences of the COI gene, and the integration of this information is a powerful tool in species delineation.

J	Lertner, J; Bulak, J				Lertner, Jean; Bulak, James			Performance differences between two endemic stocks of largemouth bass in South Carolina	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												A common-garden experiment was conducted to compare growth of two stocks of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, one from the Coastal Plain and one from the Piedmont region of South Carolina. An equal number of fish from each stock were released at age 0 in Lake Paul Wallace, a 113-ha municipal impoundment in South Carolina's Coastal Plain. Boat electrofishing during spring was used to sample the population at ages 1, 3, and 4. Relative survival, mean length and weight, weight frequency distributions, and weight-length relationships were compared between stocks. The Piedmont stock was significantly larger at age 1, whereas the Coastal Plain stock was larger at ages 3 and 4. The weight frequency distributions differed between stocks, as did the weight-length relationships. The total catch for each stock was not proportionally different from stocking rates at age 1. However, the catch of the Coastal Plain stock was significantly higher at ages 3 and 4, suggesting better survival to those ages. We conclude that these two endemic stocks exhibited different performance at one study site in the Coastal Plain. Further evaluations across regions are needed to better define the performance of these two stocks of largemouth bass and ascertain appropriate stocking regions for each stock.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2008	28	2					516	522		10.1577/M06-106.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-106.1													WOS:000255310300018

We evaluated the origin and salinity of the groundwater using major/minor ions, H-2 and O-18 stable isotopes, and H-3 and C-14 radioisotopes. Samples were collected from a multi-aquifer system including three distinct aquifers: an upper alluvial aquifer (UAA), a lower alluvial aquifer (LAA), and a hard-rock aquifer (HRA). The water facies for most of the samples were Na-Cl with total dissolved solid concentrations ranging from 1.1 g L-1 in the freshwater of the Kheirabad aquifer (KhA), 148.8 g L-1 in the brines of the HRA, and 321 g L-1 in a salt playa. The unique ionic relationships between the ions imply the salinity mainly originates from halite dissolution. Moreover, the groundwater of HRA and LAA was altered by reverse cation exchange. Although the stable isotope data suggested a modern meteoric water source for the KhA samples, the UAA, LAA, and HRA groundwaters were significantly enriched relative to the local meteoric water line. Dating with H-3 and C-14 radioisotopes confirmed the characteristic differences between the aquifers with ages of 6200 (UAA), 18,000 (LAA), and 27,500 years (HRA), which ultimately supported their varied origins. Consequently, a regional conceptual flow model was developed based on the geological settings, stratigraphic evidence, hydrochemistry, and isotopic properties, which suggests that the UAA, LAA, and HRA were due to three transgressions of inland lakes 6200, 18,000, and 27,500 ago, respectively.					; Mohammadi, Zargham/AHA-7949-2022	Rezanezhad, Fereidoun/0000-0002-9608-8005; 													1025-9112	1616-1068				DEC	2022	41	4					996	1014		10.1007/s10230-022-00902-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-022-00902-6		OCT 2022											WOS:000870090800001

However, Lake St-Pierre has seen its ecological integrity deteriorate in recent decades, largely due to the development of agriculture in and around its floodplain. This study uses a simple turbidity retrieval model (NIR and RED reflectances from Sentinel-2) to quantify the impact of land use on water turbidity within the lake floodplain during the 2019 and 2020 spring flood. Using a linear mixed effect model, we assessed how land use (wet meadows, cultivated grasslands, soybean, corn fields) impacts turbidity retrieved from Sentinel-2. Water turbidity was found to increase with the level of agricultural perturbations. During the severe and long 2019 flood, the turbidity was 5% higher over cultivated grassland fields, 35% higher over soybean fields and 70% higher over corn fields, compared to wet meadows. For 2020, a comparatively drier year, the corresponding impacts were 9% for cultivated grassland fields, 65% for soybean fields and 93% for corn fields. However, land use only explained 4% (2019) and 5% (2020) of the water turbidity spatiotemporal variance, which was instead mostly driven by the sediment load coming from upstream watersheds. Our results indicate that, despite complex processes driving water mass movements in the floodplain, intensive farming practices lead to higher water turbidity compared to natural lands. This study provides evidence that intensive agriculture impacts the water quality in a critical moment for the long-term health of the Lake St-Pierre.

Spatial, Temporal, and Matrix Variability of Clostridium botulinum Type E Toxin Gene Distribution at Great Lakes Beaches	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Clostridium botulinum type E toxin is responsible for extensive mortality of birds and fish in the Great Lakes. The C. botulinum bontE gene that produces the type E toxin was amplified with quantitative PCR from 150 sloughed algal samples (primarily Cladophora species) collected during summer 2012 from 10 Great Lakes beaches in five states; concurrently, 74 sediment and 37 water samples from four sites were also analyzed. The bontE gene concentration in algae was significantly higher than in water and sediment (P< 0.05), suggesting that algal mats provide a better microenvironment for C. botulinum. The bontE gene was detected most frequently in algae at Jeorse Park and Portage Lake Front beaches (Lake Michigan) and Bay City State Recreation Area beach on Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), where 77, 100, and 83% of these algal samples contained the bontE gene, respectively. The highest concentration of bontE was detected at Bay City (1.98 x 10(5) gene copies/ml of algae or 5.21 x 10(6) g [dry weight]). This study revealed that the bontE gene is abundant in the Great Lakes but that it has spatial, temporal, and matrix variability. Further, embayed beaches, low wave height, low wind velocity, and greater average water temperature enhance the bontE occurrence.

Inferring long-term trout population in a remote Boreal Shield lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Sivarajah B, Pink O, Paterson AM, Jeziorski A, Griffiths KT, R & uuml;hland KM, Smol JP. 2025. Lake Reserv Manag. XX-XX.We used bioindicators preserved in a dated lake sediment core to assess long-term limnological changes in a relatively remote, Boreal Shield lake in south-central Ontario, Canada. Tadenac Lake is minimally disturbed with no shoreline development, and the last major hydrological change occurred more than 100 years ago when the lake was permanently separated from Tadenac Bay (Georgian Bay, Lake Huron). In the late 1970s, anglers began reporting decreases in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) catch, and only one lake trout was observed in a 2014 fish survey. Both diatom compositional changes and a diatom-based inference model indicated a gradual decrease in pH since the construction of the permanent barrier in 1925. Since the second half of the 20th century, accelerated regional warming, with longer and warmer growing seasons and ice-free periods, have affected Tadenac Lake, as evidenced by (1) an increasing trend in spectrally inferred chlorophyll a, indicative of higher whole-lake primary production, and (2) diatom compositional changes and an increase in the index of chrysophyte scales to diatom valves, indicative of longer and stronger summer thermal stratification. Furthermore, chironomid-based inferences suggest that the hypolimnetic oxygen condition within Tadenac Lake deteriorated during the second half of the 20th century and may have negatively affected critical lake trout habitat. Overall, our study suggests that Tadenac Lake, a minimally anthropogenically disturbed site, has undergone notable limnological changes since the mid 20th century as a result of climate-mediated changes. These changes may have negatively influenced the lake trout habitat, which could have contributed to the observed decline in recruitment and catch. Our paleolimnological data from a remote lake highlight the importance of considering the long-term, gradual effects of climate-mediated changes on aquatic ecosystems, as this will aid in the development of effective habitat conservation and fisheries management strategies.

Lithium selective receptors	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS												The rising global demand for lithium and its compounds has led to a shift away from fossil fuels towards more energy-efficient systems like lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Various technologies and materials are being explored for mining and extracting lithium, but current methods like solar evaporation and critical mining are slow and deplete resources rapidly. Therefore, there is a growing need for recycling used lithium. While some multipassive technologies show promise, they often fall short in terms of cost-effectiveness, selectivity, and recyclability. Supramolecular receptors such as crown ethers, calixarenes, and their derivatives and more recently functionalized ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents offer a potential solution to these challenges. Efforts are directed to create specialized supramolecular receptors that can both sense and extract lithium ion, particularly from challenging sources like sea-brine. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of silica-based materials and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in adsorption, but there is a need for further refinement to make them viable for real-world applications. Strategies involving post-modification and transforming receptors into MOFs or other materials hold promise in improving surface area and recyclability, thus enhancing their effectiveness. This review aims to compile all existing supramolecular receptors developed for lithium sensing and extraction, comparing them with newer generation receptors. It tries to summarize their selectivity towards lithium ions, describe their mechanisms, and extraction properties, providing a comprehensive resource for researchers working in this field.					; Shrivastav, Pranav/AAT-3807-2020	Rajpurohit, Dushyantsingh/0000-0003-3543-8304; 													0010-8545	1873-3840				SEP 15	2024	515								215968	10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215968	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215968		MAY 2024											WOS:001346406900001

CuO-oxidized dissolved organic matter (DOM) investigated with comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												GC x GC-TOF-MS was applied to investigate the molecular diversity of CuO-oxidized, trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatized DOM isolated from Lake Tahoe's main tributary, the Upper Truckee River (UTR), California. Many (4789) chromatographic peaks were resolved in a single sample at a signal/noise (S/N) ratio of 10 or greater and > 300 (> 6%) were assigned discrete structures. Mapping the two dimensional elution time space revealed 8 homologous series defined by successive CH2 additions. Series of other compounds related to one another by OCH3 and OH substitutions were also assigned. Elucidation of the retention time (RT) displacements affected by these molecular transformations guided the discovery of novel compounds as well as those that had previously escaped detection within DOM, including a suite of ligninderived cyclobutane photodimers. Analysis of RT shifts among sets of benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) isomers revealed the second chromatographic dimension to strongly retain sterically strained isomers, providing a basis for assigning groups of isomers that were otherwise unassignable. The heightened chromatographic resolution also revealed a substantial and hitherto analytically inaccessible diversity of isomers, which appear to be uniquely resolved with the method, but which would fall outside the analytical window of other high resolution MS methods, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). The study likely represents the most comprehensive compound-specific elucidation of any natural OM (NOM) sample to date. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations. 2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature. 3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities. 4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration.					; Crozier, Lisa/E-2248-2012; Zabel, Richard/F-7277-2015	Crozier, Lisa/0000-0001-7744-9525; 													0021-8790	1365-2656				MAR	2010	79	2					342	349		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01641.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01641.x								20002859					WOS:000274321200006
J	Trnski, T				Trnski, T			Diel and tidal abundance of fish larvae in a barrier-estuary channel in New South Wales	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												In four 24-h series of ichthyoplankton sampling during winter (June-July) 1996 in Swansea Channel (which connects Lake Macquarie with coastal waters of central New South Wales, Australia) 3367 fish larvae representing at least 77 species were collected. The larval fish community clustered by sampling date and by diel phase. Diel phase had a stronger influence on abundance of more common taxa than did tide phase, and also most influence on community structure. For most taxa there was no difference in abundance between flood and ebb tides, regardless of the estuarine or marine source of the eggs and larvae. All but two of 16 common species were present in Swansea Channel throughout their entire larval stage. The sparids Acanthopagrus australis and Rhabdosargus sarba were present in the channel only at settlement-competent sizes. These two species showed evidence of selective presence in the channel during a particular diel or tidal phase, with A. australis apparently preferring night-flood tides, which would aid migration to the estuarine nursery habitats in Lake Macquarie.

Invasions of top predators may have strong cascading effects in ecosystems affecting both prey species abundance and lower trophic levels. A recently discussed factor that may enhance species invasion is climate change and in this context, we studied the effects of an invasion of northern pike into a subarctic lake ecosystem formerly inhabited by the native top predator Arctic char and its prey fish, ninespined stickleback. 2. Our study demonstrated a strong change in fish community composition from a system with Arctic char as top predator and high densities of sticklebacks to a system with northern pike as top predator and very low densities of sticklebacks. A combination of both predation and competition from pike is the likely cause of the extinction of char. 3. The change in top predator species also cascaded down to primary consumers as both zooplankton and predator-sensitive macroinvertebrates increased in abundance. 4. Although the pike invasion coincided with increasing summer temperatures in the study area we have no conclusive evidence that the temperature increase is the causal mechanism behind the pike invasion. But still, our study provides possible effects of future pike invasions in mountain lakes related to climate change. We suggest that future pike invasions will have strong effects in lake ecosystems, both by replacing native top consumers and through cascading effects on lower trophic levels.

Measurements of spectral optical properties and their relation to biogeochemical variables and processes in Crater Lake, Crater Lake National Park, OR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Spectral inherent optical properties (IOPs) have been measured at Crater Lake, OR, an extremely clear sub-alpine lake. Indeed Pure water IOPs are major contributors to the total IOPs, and thus to the color of the lake. Variations in the spatial distribution of IOPs were observed in June and September 2001, and reflect biogeochemical processes in the lake. Absorption by colored dissolved organic material increases with depth and between June and September in the upper 300 m. This pattern is consistent with a net release of dissolved organic materials from primary and secondary production through the summer and its photo-oxidation near the surface. Waters fed by a tributary near the lake's rim exhibited low levels of absorption by dissolved organic materials. Scattering is mostly dominated by organic particulate material, though inorganic material is found to enter the lake from the rim following a rain storm. Several similarities to oceanic oligotrophic regions are observed: (a) The Beam attenuation correlates well with particulate organic material (POM) and the relationship is similar to that observed in the open ocean. (b) The specific absorption of colored dissolved organic material has a value similar to that of open ocean humic material. (c) The distribution of chlorophyll with depth does not follow the distribution of particulate organic material due to photo-acclimation resulting in a subsurface pigment maximum located about 50 m below the POM maximum.

Half-saturation constants for NH4+ uptake in the shallow waters of both lakes were < 10 .mu.g N l-1; uptake kinetic experiments on populations forming the deep-chlorophyll layers of these lakes showed zero-order kinetics and could not be fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation. Elevated uptake within the first few minutes following pulses of NH4+ and NO3- occurred in both lakes. NH4+ regeneration, determined from isotope dilution experiments, exceeded uptake at 4.6 m in Lake Fryxell, was less than uptake at 9 m in Lake Fryxell and was equal to uptake at 10 m in Lake Vanda under the experimental conditions. NO3- uptake was suppressed by NH4+ levels as low as 2 .mu.g NH4+-N l-1 in Lake Fryxell; the suppression was strongest in the near-surface populations. Substrate-saturated C:N uptake ratios (g:g) in Lake Fryxell decreased from 8.4 near the surface to 1.8 at the bottom of the trophogenic zone. Overall, the nitrogen dynamics in these lakes are similar to other lakes and the open ocean in that biological productivity during the austral summer is supported by regenerated nutrients.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Howard-Williams, Clive/0000-0002-8323-6806; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	1989	11	2					335	351		10.1093/plankt/11.2.335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.2.335													WOS:A1989T556700011

D.			Late Holocene expansion of Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) in Kamchatka in response to increased snow cover as inferred from lacustrine oxygen-isotope records	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Holocene records of cellulose-inferred lake-water delta O-8 were produced from two lake-sediment sequences obtained in central and northern Kamchatka, Russian Far East. The sediment records share similar fluctuations in delta O-8 during the interval of ca. 5000-800 cal yr BP that correspond (inversely) with changes in K+ content of the GISP2 ice-core record from Greenland, a proxy for the relative strength of the Siberian High, suggesting control by climate-related variability in delta O-8 of regional precipitation. The dramatic expansion of Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) in northern and central Kamchatka between ca. 5000 and 4000 cal yr BP, as inferred from pollen records from the same and neighbouring sites, appears to have occurred at a time of progressively declining delta O-8 of precipitation. This development is interpreted as reflecting a regional cooling trend accompanied by increasing winter snowfall related to gradual intensification of the Siberian High from ca. 5000 to ca. 3000 cal yr BP. A thicker and more long-lasting snow cover can be assumed to have favoured P. pumila by providing a competitive advantage over other boreal and subalpine tree and shrub species in the region during the later part of the Holocene. These results, which are the first of their kind from Kamchatka, provide novel insight into the Holocene vegetational and climatic development in eastemmost Asia, as well as long-term atmospheric circulation dynamics in Beringia.

The results show that from August to October, east of Tibetan Plateau, there exists a unique LRWVT, and the water vapor from the South China Sea and the western Pacific can affect the Sichuan Basin, Northwest China and other Chinese regions far from the tropical sea through this way. From August to October, the precipitation of the region east of the Plateau is closely linked both in the intra-annual and inter-annual variations, and the LRWVT from the South China Sea and the western Pacific is an important connection mechanism. The large-scale circulation background of the LRWVT impacting the precipitation of the region east of the Plateau is as follows: At high levels, the South Asian High is generally stronger than normal and significantly enhances with its northward advance and eastward extension over the region east of the Plateau. At mid-level, a broad low pressure trough is over Lake Balkhash and its surroundings, and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is northward and westward located, and the western part of Sichuan Basin and the eastern part of Northwest China are located in the west and northwest edge of WPSH.					qi, dongmei/NYT-4516-2025; Li, Yueqing/L-9474-2016														1006-8775					MAR	2015	21	1					43	54																WOS:000352184400005

The cranes return to the breeding ground in pairs or in family groups in early March, and they migrate to south China for wintering in late September or early October. Thus the cranes are on the breeding ground for about six or seven months. With respect to the numerical distribution of red-crowned cranes in Sanjiang Plain Area, we have carried out an aerial survey from the 3rd to the 20th of May, 1984. We use a light aircraft of Y-11 type. The survey flight altitude is 80 m and the air speed 140 km/h. The total aerial transects cover 3748 km in distance, and the flight paths are shown in figure 1. The numbers (309 in total) and the distributional range of red-crowned cranes in the Sanjiang Plain Area are listed in the tab. 1 and fig. 2. The lower reaches of Duluhe River, Honghe Natural Reserve, Qixinghe River basin and Xingkai Lake lowland are the main breeding grounds of red-crowned cranes in the Sanjiang Plain Area.																			0001-7302					MAR	1987	33	1					82	87																WOS:A1987G772000012

It was hypothesised that A. nebulosus would be the dominant species of fish in various types of lakes. The study was conducted in the summer of 2014 and 2018-2021, using Nordic multi-mesh gillnets. We indicated that relative numbers and biomass of A. nebulosus decreased in the oligo-mesotrophic lake, while increased in lakes of higher trophic conditions. Body weight and total length of A. nebulosus fluctuated from 3.2 to 283.3 g and 64 to 267 mm, respectively. The coefficient of condition of this species varied widely from 0.2 to 1.8 with the highest and lowest values in the meso-eutrophic lake. Ameiurus nebulosus accounted for 0.2-34.1% of the total numbers and 2.4-36.5% of the total biomass of the fish community. In the mesotrophic and meso-eutrophic lakes, A. nebulosus was a dominant component of the fish community after 7 years. The percentage contribution of A. nebulosus to the total numbers of fish decreased with the increasing trophic status of the studied lakes. Our study showed that A. nebulosus could be one of the factors responsible for a decrease in the number of native fish species and a change in the taxonomic structure of native fish in lakes of different trophic status (from oligo-mesotrophy to eutrophy).

J	Lürling, M; van Oosterhout, F				Lurling, Miquel; van Oosterhout, Frank			Controlling eutrophication by combined bloom precipitation and sediment phosphorus inactivation	WATER RESEARCH												The hypothesis that the combination of the flocculent polyaluminium chloride (PAC) with the lanthanum-modified bentonite Phoslock (R) (Flock & Lock) could sink effectively a water bloom of cyanobacteria and could shift a turbid, cyanobacteria infested lake to a clear water lake was tested in a controlled laboratory experiment and a whole lake experiment. In the laboratory, a relatively low dose of the flocculent PAC (2.2 and 4.4 mg Al l(-1)) was insufficient to sediment positively buoyant cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa). Similarly, the lanthanum modified clay (dosed at 390 mg l(-1)) was insufficient to sediment the positively buoyant cyanobacteria. However, the combination of PAC and Phoslock (R) effectively sedimented cyanobacteria flocks. Likewise, a combined treatment of 2 tons PAC and 18 tons Phoslock (R) in Lake Rauwbraken in April 2008 effectively sedimented a developing cyanobacteria bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The average chlorophyll-a concentration in the two years prior to this Flock & Lock treatment was 19.5 (+/- 36.5) mu g l(-1), while it was as low as 3.7 (+/- 4.5) mu g l(-1) in the years following the treatment. The combined treatment effectively reduced the amount of total phosphorus (TP) in the water column from on average 169 (+/- 126) mu g P l(-1) before the application to 14 (+/- 15) mu g P l(-1) after the treatment. Based on mean summer chlorophyll-a and TP concentrations, the lake was shifted from a eutrophic/hypertrophic state to an oligo/mesotrophic state. From directly after treatment in April 2008 until and including 2013, Lake Rauwbraken remained in an oligo-mesotrophic clear water state with TP reduced to less than 10% of the pre-treatment. This result shows that eutrophication in relatively small, isolated, stratifying lakes can be restored by targeting both water column and sediment P using a combination of flocculent and solid phase P-sorbent.

Assessing the sensitivity of alpine lakes and ponds to nitrogen deposition in the Canadian Rocky Mountains	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To demonstrate the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to forecasted increases in nitrogen deposition along the eastern ranges of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, we conducted midsummer limnological surveys of 29 remote alpine lakes and ponds via helicopter in 2007. Chemical analysis of water and in vitro nitrogen-enrichment bioassays of phytoplankton collected from each site were performed to estimate nutrient limitation. Use of a common chemical index for nutrient limitation (total dissolved inorganic nitrogen: total phosphorus; DIN:TP) together with supportive experimental evidence revealed nitrogen limitation in only 14% of the cases. Shallow (a parts per thousand currency sign1 m maximum depth) ponds were more likely to be nitrogen-limited than lakes, especially as the former exhibited a significantly lower mean DIN:TP ratio of 7.4 during the late summer. Chemical and bioassay-based inferences of nitrogen limitation agreed in 74.5% of the cases, owing mainly to evidence of phosphorus limitation of the surveyed lake ecosystems (mean DIN:TP = 18) being supported by nonsignificant responses of their phytoplankton to nitrogen amendment. Our findings reveal that increased nitrogen deposition should not result in immediate widespread eutrophication of the Canadian Rockies; however, certain alpine ponds appeared nitrogen-limited, making them sensitive early indicators of the potential effects of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition in remote mountainous regions.

Average concentrations in the ocean surface water, 2.00 and 0.45 ng L(-1) for alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH, were 18% and 24% lower than values found on a 1988 cruise. Mean concentrations in ocean air were 91 pg m(-3) alpha-HCH. and 23 pg m(-3) gamma-HCH, a decrease since 1988. The water/air fugacity ratio of alpha-HCH averaged 1.86 over all stations, compared to 0.74 from 1988 measurements. A fugacity ratio greater than unity implies volatilization and reversal of the net gas exchange direction since 1988. The 1993 fugacity ratios for gamma-HCH indicated volatilization in the Bering Sea (1.25), deposition in the Gulf of Anadyr and Chirikov Basin region (0.72), and near equilibrium in the Chukchi Sea (0.90-0.98). In 1988, the net exchange of gamma-HCH was depositional at all stations. Mean fluxes on BERPAC-93 estimated from the two-film model were 30 for alpha-HCH and -1.5 for gamma-HCH (ng m(-2) day(-1), positive indicates volatilization).

High N2O emissions occurred in the littoral zone with the mean flux range of 0.19-7.11 mol N2O m(-2) h(-1). The mean CH4 fluxes ranged from 2.51-5.32 mol CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and they were significantly affected by the lake thermal regime. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in CH4 and N2O fluxes under the light and dark conditions, and sunlight greatly increased N2O emissions by stimulating the algal photosynthesis, but decreased CH4 emissions. Overall the littoral zone represented a weak CO2 sink with the mean flux range of -0.37-0.13 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1). The mean ecosystem respiration and photosynthesis rates varied from 0.47-2.90 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from -0.33 to -2.63 mmol CO2 m(-2) h(-1). The combined global warming potential (GWP) of N2O and CH4 fluxes completely counteracted and surpassed CO2 uptake by the algal photosynthesis, and high GWP-positive of N2O and CH4 emissions might convert an algal-rich lake site with a net CO2 uptake into a net radiative forcing source during the ice-free period.

Thus, knowledge of the hydrological fluctuation history is essential for understanding the relationship between humans and the environment in the region. Here we present a record of Holocene lake hydrodynamic intensity based on the grain size of suspended lacustrine silt isolated from the sediments of Bosten Lake, which feeds a river flowing to the northeastern Tarim Basin. The results show that lake hydrodynamic intensity was very weak during the early Holocene (12.0-8.2 ka); and then increased with two distinct centennial-millennial-scale intervals of weak intensity during 4.7-3.7 ka and 1.2-0.5 ka. Notably, increases in lake hydrodynamic intensity occurred 2.2 kyr prior to an increase in local precipitation. We speculate that this was a consequence of relatively high early summer temperatures during 8.2-6.0 ka that resulted in an increased water supply from melting snow and ice in mountainous areas of the catchment. Thus, we conclude that the changes of the Holocene hydrodynamic intensity of Bosten Lake were mainly controlled by temperature or precipitation at different times. The variations in the hydrodynamic intensity of Bosten Lake also influenced water availability for the human population that occupied the downstream area of the northeastern Tarim Basin. A drastic decrease in hydrodynamic intensity of Bosten Lake occurred around 400 and 700 CE likely has caused the emigration of the inhabitants and cultural collapse of Loulan Kingdom.					; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; 梁, 洁/GRY-6915-2022	Xie, Haichao/0000-0002-3035-4526; Vachula, Richard/0000-0001-5559-6540; Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2021	576								110499	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110499		JUN 2021											WOS:000668458200003

Progress Toward Lake Trout Rehabilitation at a Stocked and Unstocked Reef in Southern Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Sustained efforts to restore naturally reproducing populations through the stocking of marked juvenile Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush have occurred since the 1960s but have been largely unsuccessful in achieving that goal. Julian's Reef in southwestern Lake Michigan has been a targeted Lake Trout rehabilitation site since 1985 and was designated a first-priority site in a revised management strategy for Lake Trout rehabilitation in 2011. We evaluated progress toward rehabilitation objectives for spawning Lake Trout at Julian's Reef and compared that progress to unstocked Waukegan Reef nearby in light of a recent increase to approximately 50% unmarked adults at both sites, as detected by annual fall spawning assessments. We observed significant progress toward meeting the rehabilitation objectives for adult Lake Trout in southern Lake Michigan. The spawning populations at Julian's Reef and Waukegan Reef did not differ in relative abundance, sex ratio, age structure, or spawner sources (stocking location; clipped or unclipped) except that the sex ratio at Waukegan Reef during the assessment period favored female spawners. These results suggest that the adult Lake Trout population is strong enough to permit natural recruitment in southern Lake Michigan, warranting the need to identify the source of natural reproduction so as to fully evaluate factors related to rehabilitation success. We propose that management agencies should consider investigating other unstocked sites where Lake Trout may be spawning and should revise their rehabilitation plans to include actions that could limit detrimental impacts on naturally reproducing populations where they exist.

Relative abundance of Ponto-Caspian gobiids in the lower Vistula River (Poland) 3-to 4 years after first appearance	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												In the years 2000-2001, specimens of two Ponto-Caspian gobiids (racer goby Neogobius gymnotrachelus and monkey goby Apollonia fluviatilis) were recorded for the first time in the lower Vistula River, which is a part of the central inland corridor used by Ponto-Caspian species to migrate in Europe. In 2004, seine net surveys were made in the river course to examine relative abundance of the non-indigenous gobiids in the local small-fish community. Altogether 4420 specimens with total lengths ranging from 10 to 340 mm (mostly < 100 mm) belonging to 18 species were recorded in 70 hauls. Monkey goby was one of the subdominant species (18.1% of total number of fish captured; 64.3% frequency of occurrence in hauls) together with bleak Alburnus alburnus (21.0, 54.3), roach Rutilus rutilus (18.2, 67.1) and three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculaetus (17.3, 37.1). Racer goby was less abundant but quite common (2.5, 32.9), similar to common bream/white bream Abramis brama/Blicca bjoerkna (6.4, 47.1), Eurasian perch Perca. uviatilis (5.7, 57.1), dace Leuciscus leuciscus (4.2, 40.0) and European bitterling Rhodeus sericeus amarus (3.4, 27.1). The study shows that Ponto-Caspian gobiids dispersed successfully in the lower Vistula, becoming species common to its nearshore zone 3- to 4 years after their first appearance.

Design-Randomised trial during the summer mountaineering season. Setting-High altitude research laboratory in the Capanna Regina Margherita at 4559m above sea level (Alps Valais). Subjects-31 climbers with symptoms of acute mountain sickness randomly assigned to different treatments. Interventions-One hour of treatment in the hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 193 mbar or oral administration of 8mg dexamethasone initially, followed by 4mg after 6 hours. Main outcome measures-Symptoms of acute mountain sickness (Lake Louise score, clinical score, and AMS-C score) before one and about 11 hours after beginning the different methods of treatment. Permitted intake of mild analgesics before treatment and in the follow up period. Results-After one hour of treatment compression with 193 mbar caused a significantly greater relief of symptoms of acute mountain sickness than dexamethasone (Lake Louise score: mean (SD) -4.6 (1.9) v -2.5 (1.8); clinical score: -4.0 (1.2) v -1.5 (1.4); AMS-C score: -1.24 (0.51) v -0.54 (0.59)). In contrast after about 11 hours subjects treated with dexamethasone suffered from significantly less severe acute mountain sickness than subjects treated with the hyperbaric chamber (-7.0 (3.6) v -1.6 (3.0); -4.1 (1.9) v -1.0 (1.5); -1.78 (0.73) v -0.75 (0.82) respectively). Intake of analgesics was similar in both groups. Conclusion-Both methods were efficient in treatment of acute mountain sickness. One hour of compression with 193 mbar in the hyperbaric chamber, corresponding to a descent of 2250 m, led to short term improvement but had no long term beneficial effect. On the other hand, treatment with dexamethasone in an oral dose of 8mg initially followed by 4mg every 6 hours resulted in a longer term clinical improvement. For optimal efficacy the two methods should be combined if descent or evacuation is not possible.

Before COVID-19-related restrictions, the number of tourists in this area increased annually, which was associated with the attractiveness of this terrain for visitors. The potential of the tourism sector of Okinsky District comes from the combination of a large number of natural resources. The area has rich water resources, including rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and mineral springs, with well-preserved mountainous landscapes accompanied by a centuries-old cultural and ethnic heritage. Due to Okinsky District's specific border location and remoteness, the area has a very large number of places for recreation. The objective of our work is to clarify key factors hindering the development of tourism in the district. The study is aimed at examining the state of natural objects and determining their importance for locals, vacationers, and the district as a whole. In this regard, a problem integrity scope and a networked approach to the accompanying analysis reveal the mechanisms that contribute to the conservation of biological diversity of natural objects and their rational, scientifically grounded use in the tourism industry in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. The set of problems that impede the active promotion of tourism were identified. However, these problems are typical not only for the studied district but also many other remote areas of the Russian Federation.

However, it is unclear whether these proxies reflect past variability in temperature or hydrology. Here, we report the hydrogen and carbon isotopic variability of n-alkanoic acid of chain length 28 (delta D-C28 and delta C-13(C28), respectively) and demonstrate that the peatland leaf wax hydrogen isotopes provide a sensitive record of past hydrology. The decoupling of delta C-13(C28) and delta D of vegetation-corrected rain during the Holocene indicate that delta D of the leaf wax compounds mainly respond to past hydrological variability whereas delta C-13 variations might reflect the temperature-controlled variability of C3 and C4 vegetation. Conforming with the other paleoclimate records from the region, the delta D-C28 variations showed a reducing precipitation trend since the early Holocene. However, a large amplitude of reconstructed dD of rain (similar to 44%) during the Holocene indicated changes in the moisture source and trajectory could be an additional factor contributing to the orbital-scale dD variability of proxies from the Indian region.

However, as one of the most important wintering place for migratory birds in the world, the impact of PER on migratory bird habitats in Dongting Lake wetland has not been evaluated. In this paper, we used the habitat suitability index model based on remote sensing to explore the impact of PER on the four mainly migratory bird guilds (Anatidae, Charadriidae, Ardeidae and Laridae) in Dongting Lake wetland. The suitability included four grades: poorly (0-25), generally (25-50), moderately (50-75), and highly (75-100). The results showed that the area of poplars in Dongting Lake wetland decreased significantly after PER was implemented. There was a negative correlation between poplar area and moderate grade habitat area of Anatidae and Ardeidae, and a positive correlation between poplar area and general grade habitat area. However, there was no significant change in different grades of habitat area of Charadriidae and Laridae after PER. Thus, PER improved the habitat suitability of Anatidae and Ardeidae, but had no significant effect on the suitability of habitat for Charadriidae and Laridae. These conclusions could provide reference for understanding the living conditions of Dongting Lake wetland waterbirds, determining the priority protection areas and maintaining wetland biodiversity.

The relation between interdecadal changes in weather conditions and climate warming is uncertain. Here, we analyze long-term variations of an integrated pollution-linked meteorological index (which is approximately and linearly related to aerosol pollution), the extent of changes in vertical temperature differences in the boundary layer (BL) in BIV, and northerly surface winds from Lake Baikal during wintertime to evaluate the potential contribution of climate warming to changes in meteorological conditions directly related to aerosol pollution in this area; this is accomplished using NCEP reanalysis data, surface observations, and long-term vertical balloon sounding observations since 1960. The weather conditions affecting BIV aerosol pollution are found to have worsened since the 1960s as a whole. This worsening is more significant after 2010, with PM2.5 reaching unprecedented high levels in many cities in China, particularly in BIV. The decadal worsening of meteorological conditions in BIV can partly be attributed to climate warming, which is defined by more warming in the higher layers of the boundary layer (BL) than the lower layers. This worsening can also be influenced by the accumulation of aerosol pollution, to a certain extent (particularly after 2010), because the increase in aerosol pollution from the ground leads to surface cooling by aerosol-radiation interactions, which facilitates temperature inversions, increases moisture accumulations, and results in the extra deterioration of meteorological conditions. If analyzed as a linear trend, weather conditions have worsened by similar to 4% each year from 2010 to 2017. Given such a deterioration rate, the worsening of weather conditions may lead to a corresponding amplitude increase in PM2.5 in BIV during wintertime in the next 5 years (i.e., 2018 to 2022). More stringent emission reduction measures will need to be conducted by the government.

J	Jost, MA; Hamr, J; Filion, I; Mallory, FF				Jost, MA; Hamr, J; Filion, I; Mallory, FF			Forage selection by elk in habitats common to the French River - Burwash region of Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												A study of two herds of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) introduced into the French River - Burwash regions of Ontario in the 1940s was undertaken to assess forage selection and availability. Studies in western North America have shown that the diets of elk vary seasonally, spatially, and in response to forage availability, palatability, plant phenology, plant species diversity, and habitat type. These studies have concluded that grasses, browse, and forbs were preferred forage items and that indigenous grass was used most. In an attempt to obtain a more detailed understanding of forage use in relation to habitat type, selection and availability of forage in ridge, mixed-forest, and grassland habitats was analyzed by tracking elk during a 2-year period. More than 1000 forage occasions were recorded from approximately 60 animals. It was hypothesized that Rocky Mountain elk in the French River - Burwash region would select forage species similar to those found in western North America. The results of this study support the following conclusions: (i) elk in the French River - Burwash regions of Ontario use ridge, mixed-forest, and grassland habitats for foraging; (ii) most forage consumed by elk in this region is woody species, grasses, or forbs, common in mixed-forest habitats; (iii) open grasslands increased forage diversity minimally and appeared to be the least important for foraging; (iv) uncultivated grasslands dominated by Old World agricultural gaminoid species, such as timothy (Phleum pratense), quack grass (Elymus repens), wire grass (Poa compressa), and redtop (Agrostis gigantea), or by indigenous graminoid species, such as white-grained mountain rice (Oryzopsis asperifolia), Canada blue joint (Calamagrostis canadensis), poverty oat grass (Danthonia spicata), and (or) fringed brome grass (Bromus ciliatus), may provide little nutritional support for elk in this region; (v) habitats containing large amounts of willow (Salix spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), and common hairgrass (Deschampsia flexuosa) provide a significant forage base for elk in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence ectone; and (vi) relocated Rocky Mountain elk in Ontario use forage classes similar to those utilized by elk in western North America; however, woody browse is the dominant forage used.																			0008-4301					SEP	1999	77	9					1429	1438		10.1139/cjz-77-9-1429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-77-9-1429													WOS:000084047400012

Although much is known about Burbot population dynamics, little is known about their movement patterns. Our objectives were to describe the movement dynamics of Burbot in the upper Green River system to provide information on the ecology of Burbot and insight on possible management actions. In total, 875 Burbot were tagged with PIT tags in the upper Green River and Fontenelle Reservoir; their movements were tracked from August 2016 to March 2018. Additionally, 22 Burbot were tagged with radio transmitters in Fontenelle Reservoir in November 2017, and 13 Burbot were tagged with radio transmitters in the upper Green River in November 2018. Of these fish, 11 Burbot tagged in Fontenelle Reservoir and all river-tagged Burbot were tracked as they migrated into the Green River and associated tributaries during the spawning season. Upstream and downstream movements of Burbot tagged with PIT tags in Fontenelle Reservoir and the upper Green River peaked during December-January and were synchronized with river temperatures reaching 0 degrees C. Of the total number of PIT-tagged Burbot, 10-15% of those tagged in Fontenelle Reservoir were detected in the Green River during the spawning season and 15% of those tagged in the Green River were detected moving downstream toward Fontenelle Reservoir during the spawning period. Movements of radiotelemetered Burbot were synchronized with river ice-up in mid-December. Maximum upstream distance traveled by adfluvial Burbot was 5.8 km. Fluvial Burbot primarily migrated downstream during the spawning period, and maximum downstream distance traveled was 17.7 km. Detection data suggest that both fluvial and adfluvial Burbot occupy the same reaches during the spawning period and areas near Fontenelle Reservoir are important for spawning. Results of this study will assist with the management of Burbot in this system by shedding light on Burbot movement patterns and identifying areas of high Burbot use for targeted suppression efforts. Results also contribute to our understanding of the variability in Burbot ecology.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2020	40	5					1161	1173		10.1002/nafm.10480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10480		SEP 2020											WOS:000569045200001

Here, we use pollen data from Wulagai Lake, Inner Mongolia, to reconstruct vegetation and climate changes since the middle MIS 3. The steppe biome is reconstructed as the first dominant biome and the desert biome as the second, and the results show that the vegetation was steppe over the last 43,800 years. Poaceae, Artemisia, Caryophyllaceae and Humulus were abundant from middle to late MIS 3, indicating humid climate conditions. As drought-tolerant species such as Hippophae, Nitraria and Chenopodiaceae spread during MIS 2, the climate became arid. The Holocene is characterized by the dominance of steppe with mixed coniferous-broadleaved forests in the Greater Hinggan Range, and the desert biome retains high affinity scores, indicating that the climate was semi-arid. The climate from middle to late MIS 3 was wetter than in the Holocene: this shift was related to changes in the Northern Hemisphere's solar insolation and ice volume. The humid conditions during MIS 3 were attributed to strong ice-albedo feedback, which led to evaporation that was less than the precipitation. The enhanced evaporation caused by increased solar insolation and decreased ice volume might have exceeded the precipitation during the Holocene and resulted in low effective humidity in the Wulagai Lake basin.

Comparison of 1982-1983 total P and total filtrable P concentrations with data from 1990-1991 and other published data showed little change. The measured annual primary flux of P to the sediment surface reflected rapid sedimentation of both allochthonous particles and spring diatom production. Diatoms were the dominant vector of P to the sediment surface. Terrigenous phases and autochthonous calcite were also significant. More than half of the mixed-period diatom P demand was provided by colloidal and particulate P, nearly 60% of diatom-associated P was recycled within the water column, and 55-58% of total primary P flux was recycled at the sediment surface. Ultimately 2.2% of C and 2.7% of P became incorporated into recent sediments. The amount of P supplied by resuspension was relatively small compared with water-column standing pools and major flux vectors. With its relatively long residence, the response time for P changes with respect to lending should be on the order of 5-15 years.																			0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						285	322																WOS:A1994BZ52H00009

The seismic events were recorded in the summer of 2004 using a high-density seismometer array. The seismic velocity model used in the generation of Green's functions is based on radio-echo soundings to approximate the basal topography, which beneath the study site exhibits a strong inclination. As the basal conditions are not well known, we try moment tensor inversions with seismic velocity profiles consisting of two and three media. The former case consists of homogeneous ice resting on bedrock, whereas the latter case includes a thin basal layer with slow seismic velocities representing eroded material or highly fractured ice. Effects of errors in Green's functions are estimated by sensitivity studies in which we invert 1D and 3D synthetics using Green's functions of wrong velocity models. The results show that calculations of source types and fault plane orientations of tensile cracks are rather robust with respect to errors in Green's functions. However, the quality of the waveform fits depends on strike and dip of the synthetic source. When inverting seismograms, Green's functions of the seismic model that includes the basal slow velocity layer are found to give the most realistic source types as well as the best waveform fits. The fault mechanisms derived from constrained moment tensor inversions are near-horizontal tensile cracks, which suggest a complex time-dependent basal stress field.

Data were used in conjunction with economic impact data of known-cause fish kill events, Rule 17-11.01 (animal damage valuation), Chapter 403, Florida Statutes, to estimate monetary values of the fisheries of important Lake Okeechobee vegetation communities. Mean total impact values per hectare of vegetated area ranged from $44,626 for Illinois pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis) to $59,738 for hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata). Replacement economic values made up at least 88.9% of the total impact value in the valuation of all vegetation types. Recreational values per hectare of vegetated area ranged from $447 for eel-grass (Vallisneria americana) to $5,378 for bulrush (Scirpus californicus and S. validus). Commercial values contributed nominally to the total impact values, constituting no more than 0.06% in the valuation of each vegetation type. Fish species that provided the greatest economic value were bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), eastern mosquito-fish (Gambusia holbrooki), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropertus salmoides), and redear sunfish (L. microlophus). Economic valuation of fisheries habitat may be used as a method of managing aquatic habitat in multiple resource water systems.																									1994							575	591																WOS:A1994BJ69M00068
J	Christiansen, B; Ljungqvist, FC				Christiansen, Bo; Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier			Reconstruction of the Extratropical NH Mean Temperature over the Last Millennium with a Method that Preserves Low-Frequency Variability	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A new multiproxy reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical mean temperature over the last millennium is presented. The reconstruction is performed with a novel method designed to avoid the underestimation of low-frequency variability that has been a general problem for regression-based reconstruction methods. The disadvantage of this method is an exaggerated high-frequency variability. The reconstruction is based on a set of 40 proxies of annual to decadal resolution that have been shown to relate to the local temperature. The new reconstruction shows a very cold Little Ice Age centered around the 17th century with a cold extremum (for 50-yr smoothing) of about 1.1 K below the temperature of the calibration period, AD 1880-1960. This cooling is about twice as large as corresponding numbers reported by most other reconstructions. In the beginning of the millennium the new reconstruction shows small anomalies in agreement with previous studies. However, the new temperature reconstruction decreases faster than previous reconstructions in the first 600 years of the millennium and has a stronger variability. The salient features of the new reconstruction are shown to be robust to changes in the calibration period, the source of the local temperatures, the spatial averaging procedure, and the screening process applied to the proxies. An ensemble pscudoproxy approach is applied to estimate the confidence intervals of the 50-yr smoothed reconstruction showing that the period AD 1500-1850 is significantly colder than the calibration period.

However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.

Derrick			Mapping spatial dimensions of Wilderness recreation outcomes: a study of overnight users	ECO MONT-JOURNAL ON PROTECTED MOUNTAIN AREAS RESEARCH												Grand Teton National Park (GRTE) is a popular mountain recreation destination which, like many National Park Service (NPS) units, has experienced a significant increase in visitation in recent years, with toted visits increasing by 27% between 2014 and 2017 (NPS 2020. Particularly popular within GRTE is the String and Leigh Lakes (SLL) area, which is a favoured alpine destination for numerous day-use recreation activities and also an important starting point for backcountry and overnight recreational users within GRTE's Recommended Wilderness. To better understand the visitor experience of overnight backcountry recreationists in the SLL area, data were collected using novel public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) during the summer of 2018. PPGIS data were used to identify the locations in which overnight recreationists experienced positive and negative recreation outcomes. Results indicate that they experience more positive outcomes within the Recommended Wilderness, away from high-density, trailhead-proximate areas outside the Recommended Wilderness. Findings also indicate that overnight users experience crowding and conflict more outside of the Recommended Wilderness than elsewhere on their backcountry trip While this may seem intuitive these are some of the first empirical results spatially contextualizing backcountry visitor outcomes in a popular national park, The findings thus provide managers with visitor experience baseline that can be monitored and adaptively managed in the future.

Inferring Adaptive Nature of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Polymorphism from Single Nucleotide Substitutions in Asian Sockeye Salmon Populations: II. Factors Determining Onne-DAB Gene Variability in the Kamchatka River Basin	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Variability of the Onne-DAB gene is examined using two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (One_MHC2_190v2 and One_MHC2_251v2) in datasets of early (spring) running sockeye salmon from tributaries and streams of the Kamchatka River basin. Differences in intrapopulation variability indices and interpopulation differentiation estimates in the datasets from different parts of the basin are most likely caused by action of different types of pathogen-induced selection in certain localities of the lake-river system. According to the results of factor analysis, two principal components (PC) are extracted. In sum, they explain 72% of general variability of genetic characteristics in the sockeye salmon datasets. A significant correlation between the second PC (33.4%) values and geographical distances from the corresponding tributary to Azabach'e Creek (Lake Azabach'e was selected as a reference point because it is the nursing lake for young sockeye from several tributaries and is located near the Kamchatka River mouth) is revealed. Moreover, a highly significant correlation between the second PC and prevalence of plerocercoid of Diphyllbothrium sp. in fish from the tributaries is derived.

Organic detritus made up most of the diet ash-free-dry-mass (AFDM) throughout the year, averaging 97.79%, with algae (2.12%) and bacteria (0.09%) making up the remainder of the diet AFDM. Assimilation efficiency for AFDM averaged 72% during warmer months and 53% during cooler months (annual mean = 61%). Gut fullness (amount of AFDM in the anterior one-tenth of the intestine) was low (mean = 0.10 mg diet AFDM . g(-1) ammocoete). There were no significant differences in these measures between ammocoetes collected from the Upper Peninsula and those collected throughout the Great Lakes basin. From a laboratory-determined relationship between gut fullness and feeding rate, feeding rate in the field was estimated to be extremely slow, ranging from 4.2 to 5.5 mg diet AFDM . g(-1) ammocoete . d(-1). These observations indicate that larval lampreys efficiently utilize a diet of organic detritus during warmer months when stream temperatures and food quality are more favorable for feeding, digestion, and growth.

J	Hafner, DJ; Shuster, CJ				Hafner, DJ; Shuster, CJ			Historical biogeography of western peripheral isolates of the least shrew, Cryptotis parva	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												The least shrew, Cryptotis parva, has expanded its distribution westward during the past 20-30 years in response to increased irrigation and a simultaneous trend toward more mesic climate. The species is recolonizing regions that it invaded coincident with increased summer precipitation during the late Wisconsinan (13,000 years ago) before being forced to the south and east during the establishment of modern desert-scrub vegetation 4,000 years ago. Allozymic patterns among three recently discovered peripheral populations of Cryptotis parva in eastern New Mexico compared to a population from within the continuous range of the species in Texas indicate that two populations probably resulted from recent dispersal from the east, while a third may represent a relict of late Wisconsinan and altithermal intervals. This population, at Bitter Lake along the Pecos River Valley, is isolated from eastern populations by an elevated, arid plateau and from southern populations along the Pecos River by 600 km; it has a unique allozymic complement and it resembles the southern subspecies (C. p. berlandieri) in cranial morphology. Range maps of species of mammals must be viewed with caution, particularly at their distributional limits, in light of recent documentation of substantial range shifts (up to 450 km) over periods of 2-3 decades.																			0022-2372					MAY	1996	77	2					536	545		10.2307/1382827	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382827													WOS:A1996UM56200026

The freshwater input increased the UVA diffuse attenuation coefficient (up to 2.7 m(-1)) near the Pearl River estuary and consequently influenced the UVR inhibitory effects, as VDR was significantly correlated with the UVA diffuse attenuation coefficient. UVR inhibition of PP was significantly higher in upwelled waters than downwelled waters, suggesting that the vertical mixing (i.e. upwelling and downwelling) was an important factor regulating microbial sensitivity to UVR. UVR inhibited PP and BP by similar to 15 and 25%, respectively, and the UVR inhibition of BP was significantly higher than that of PP in most of the samples; hence there was a competitive advantage for phytoplankton over bacteria under the relatively high UVR exposure. UVR increased VDR by similar to 30%, which decreased bacterial mortality by 0.12 to 0.3% h(-1) and mitigated the inhibitory effects of UVR on bacteria. In general, phytoplankton were more tolerant than bacteria and viruses to UVR in the sub-tropical northern South China Sea.

WATER QUALITY - A KEY ISSUE OF DRINKING WATER SUPPLY IN TIRANA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Albania is a small mountainous country and the total land area covers 28 748 km(2), meanwhile it has a rich hydrographic net (groundwater, streams, rivers, springs, lakes, wetlands). This net includes over 200 big natural resources of groundwater. Natural water qualities of our country generally are good, not only for groundwater but also for surface waters as: rivers, lakes or open reservoirs. However, there are many problems concerning drinking water supply in Albania and especially in the capital city, Tirana. The population of Tirana during the last 15 years is growing up every year and taking into account the so-called 'semi-urban' areas it is approximately I million. The drinking water supply in Tirana includes some sources such as groundwater, wells, and reservoir of Bovilla. All these water sources are different regarding physical and chemical characteristics, as well as microbiological ones. Another problem is safety and sanitation of drinking water distribution in network infrastructure. The network is very old and damaged (old pipes, old hydraulic and mechanical performance). Pollution water indicators are monitored aiming to support water authorities to achieve optimal operation of the available network and for the development of remote control and monitoring. The data on the operational status of network required not only to manage the water supply service but also to meet requirements set by consumers and the state.

J	LIENERT, C; SHORT, SA; VONGUNTEN, HR				LIENERT, C; SHORT, SA; VONGUNTEN, HR			URANIUM INFILTRATION FROM A RIVER TO SHALLOW GROUNDWATER	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The infiltration of uranium from the polluted River Glatt (Switzerland) into a hydraulically connected saturated aquifer was investigated during a period of almost five years. The uranium concentrations and the U-234/U-238 activity ratios (ARs) were analysed monthly in the water of the river and of four groundwater sampling wells. The speciation of uranium and its relation to other aqueous and solid components were investigated experimentally and in model calculations. The uranium concentration and the ARs in the river varied seasonally with a maximum and a minimum, respectively, in summer. Processes, such as photo-reductive dissolution of iron-oxyhydroxides or the enhanced decomposition of organic matter and calcite in the upstream, eutrophic Lake Greifen may have caused these variations. Laboratory experiments confirmed a possible release of uranium by photochemical reactions. The concentration maximum of uranium was also detected in the shallow groundwater, but with a delay of about six months to the maximum in the river. Under the assumption that the maxima in the river and the groundwater were related, an in situ distribution coefficient (K-D) for uranium of approximate to 7 mL g(-1) can be calculated for this Quaternary gravel aquifer. Uranium was present predominantly as UO2-carbonate complexes, whereas the formation of phosphate and organic complexes (e.g., UO2-humates/EDTA/NTA) was negligible. Particles and colloids played a minor role for the transport of uranium in this aquifer. In the course of this study, we observed an ongoing general decrease of the uranium concentrations and a disappearance of its summerly maxima in the River Glatt. We relate this unexpected effect to a better control of the phosphate concentration in surface waters, which diminished the growth of aquatic biota. This, in turn, led to changes in the redox conditions of lake and river sediments, and herewith to a reduced release of heavy metals, including uranium. The results of this case study can be applied to estimate the migration behavior of other actinide oxyions (e.g., PuO22+/NpO2+) in shallow heterogeneous aquifers, which abound in alpine and pre-alpine locations.																			0016-7037					DEC	1994	58	24					5455	5463		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90242-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90242-9													WOS:A1994PY69300007
J	Dotterweich, M				Dotterweich, Markus			The history of soil erosion and fluvial deposits in small catchments of central Europe: Deciphering the long-term interaction between humans and the environment - A review	GEOMORPHOLOGY					39th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	OCT 09-11, 2008	Austin, TX					During the last few decades, many case studies focused on the dynamics of fluvial systems in response to hillslope erosion, land-use impact, and climate changes. This paper will review the current state of knowledge of the dynamics of past soil erosion and gullying in small catchments (< 1 km(2)), the effects to adjacent fluvial systems and possible feedback mechanisms to land-use changes for the last 7000 years in central Europe. The discussed studies were made on hillslopes and gully systems in low mountain range areas. They are characterised by coupled slope-channel systems as well as uncoupled systems like closed depressions in Pleistocene lowlands, maars, lakes, and sunken areas. The studies show that sediment fluxes in small catchments are highly sensitive to local land-use changes while river sediments show regional trends in land-use and climate changes. Peaks of soil erosion and gullying took place during phases of rapid climate change. Particularly, extreme precipitation events Caused intensive runoff on slopes used for agriculture. The most remarkable phases occurred in the first half of 14th and in the mid- l8th to the early 19th century. Most of the gully systems in Europe today are a result of these catastrophic occurrences. These punctuated events triggered land abandonment and influenced the ecosystem and the socio-economic situation. The results imply that a future increase in land-use intensity and extreme precipitation events during climatic change might have severe consequences regarding soil erosion, flood risk, and ecological aspects.

J	Frumkin, A				Frumkin, Amos			Stable isotopes of a subfossil Tamarix tree from the Dead Sea region, Israel, and their implications for the Intermediate Bronze Age environmental crisis	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Trees growing on the Mt. Sedom salt diapir, at the southern Dead Sea shore, were swept by runoff into salt caves and Subsequently deposited therein, sheltered from surface weathering. A subfossil Tamarix tree trunk, found in a remote section of Sedom Cave is radiocarbon dated to between similar to 2265 and 1930 BCE. It was sampled in 109 points across the tree rings for carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The Sedom Tumarix demonstrates a few hundred years of C-13 and N-15 isotopic enrichment, culminating in extremely high delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Calibration using modern Tamarix stable isotopes in various climatic settings in Israel shows direct relationship between isotopic enrichment and climate deterioration, particularly rainfall decrease. The subfossil Tamarix probably reflects ail environmental crisis during the Intermediate Bronze Age, which subsequently killed the tree similar to 1930 BCE. This period coincides with the largest historic fall of the Dead Sea level, as well as the demise of the large regional urban center of the 3rd millennium BCE. The environmental crisis may thus explain the archaeological evidence of a shift from urban to pastoral culture during the Intermediate Bronze Age. This was apparently the most severe long-term historical drought that affected the region in the mid-late Holocene. (c) 2009 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

However, it can be difficult to distinguish plant waxes derived from aquatic versus terrestrial plants, causing uncertainty in climate interpretations. We test the hypothesis that Arctic lake sediment mid- and long-chain plant waxes derive from aquatic and terrestrial plants, respectively. We compare n-alkanoic acid and n-alkane chain-length distributions and n-alkanoic acid delta H-2 and delta C-13 values of the 29 most abundant modern plant taxa to those for soils, water filtrates, and lake sediments in the Qaupat Lake (QPT) catchment, Nunavut, Canada. Chain length distributions are variable among terrestrial plants, but similar and dominated by mid-chain waxes among submerged/floating aquatic plants. Sedimentary wax distributions are similar to those in submerged/floating aquatic plants and to Salix spp., which are among the most abundant terrestrial plants in the QPT catchment. Mid-chain n-alkanoic acid delta H-2 values are similar in sediments and submerged/floating aquatic plants, but 50 parts per thousand lower than Salix spp. In contrast, sedimentary long-chain n-alkanoic acid delta H-2 values fall between those for submerged/floating aquatic plants and Salix spp. We therefore infer that mid-chain waxes in QPT are primarily from aquatic plants, whereas long-chain waxes are from a mix of terrestrial and aquatic plants. In Arctic lakes like QPT, terrestrial wax transport via leaf litter and surface flow is limited by low-lying topography and sparse vegetation. If these lakes also have abundant aquatic plants growing near the sediment-water interface, the aquatic plants can contribute large portions of sedimentary waxes.

Recruitment Bottlenecks for Age-0 Walleye in Northern Wisconsin Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Some northern Wisconsin lakes have shown declines in catches of age-0 Walleye Sander vitreus in standardized fall electrofishing sampling, suggesting that recruitment bottlenecks are occurring in the first several months of life. In 2016 and 2017, we sampled six lakes with declining trends in natural Walleye recruitment (D-NR lakes) and seven lakes with a history of sustained natural recruitment (S-NR lakes) to determine if timing of potential recruitment bottlenecks for age-0 Walleye were consistent among D-NR lakes and if abiotic and biotic metrics differed between D-NR and S-NR lakes. We also examined diets of larval Walleye to assess prey items that may be important to early growth and survival and to determine if occurrence of piscivory was related to larval Walleye total length. Differential patterns in the presence and absence of age-0 Walleye at different life history stages in the first 6 months of life suggested that recruitment bottlenecks in D-NR lakes were consistently occurring before mid-July (five of six lakes). Mean Secchi depth, surface conductivity, abundance of larval Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, and most metrics of zooplankton abundance and mean size were similar between D-NR and S-NR lakes. Log(10) transformed number of adult Walleye per hectare was lower and adult mean total length was higher in D-NR lakes. Across all lakes, diets of larval Walleye consisted of zooplankton and larval fish and the occurrence of piscivory was higher than reported in previous studies and was positively related to total length of larval Walleye. Causes of recruitment bottlenecks in D-NR lakes remain unclear, making it difficult to identify management actions that might be implemented to circumvent these bottlenecks. However, our results indicate that future research should focus on the period between egg deposition and mid-July.

SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Study and control IOLs were implanted into the left eyes and right eyes of 5 New Zealand rabbits. Eyes were examined at the slitlamp from 1 through 4 weeks. At 4 weeks, the globes were enucleated and evaluated under a very-high-frequency ultrasound. Photographs were taken and capsular bag opacification scored from the posterior aspect (Miyake-Apple view), and the eyes were processed for complete histopathology. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the posterior capsule opacification score was 0.0 in the study group and 1.75 +/- 0.5 (SD) in the control group (P=.005, paired t test). Ultrasound examination showed that 2 of the study IOLs had no contact between the posterior optic surface and the posterior capsule. Minimal proliferative cortical material was confined to the peripheral space between anterior and posterior rings of the study IOL haptics in localized areas at the equatorial region of the capsular bag. Anterior capsule opacification was absent in all eyes. CONCLUSIONS: The study IOL is a modification of a previous design, incorporating haptic perforations between the peripheral rings. By maintaining an open capsular bag and enhancing endocapsular inflow of aqueous, this modified design appears to prevent capsular bag opacification.																			0886-3350					SEP	2012	38	9					1664	1670		10.1016/j.jcrs.2012.04.040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrs.2012.04.040								22795975					WOS:000308731200023
J	Christian, CS				Christian, Colmore S.			The Caribbean's Geotourism Potential and Challenges: A Focus on Two Islands in the Region	GEOSCIENCES												Geotourism is a relatively new concept in the tourism industry, a concept which apparently has not yet been formally embraced by Caribbean destinations. This paper, based primarily on a literature review supplemented by the first-hand knowledge of the author, who served for over a decade in the natural resource management and tourism sectors in the region, identifies some of the geotourism assets and assesses the geotourism potential of two selected Caribbean islands, namely the Commonwealth of Dominica and St. Lucia. Indications are that the islands of the region have outstanding geological formations, dormant and active volcanic zones and associated geomorphological features, and breath-taking terrestrial and marine landscapes, including deep river gorges and tall mountains, and beautiful beaches, which together constitute important geotourism assets. Currently, these resources are marketed and promoted as part of the region's nature tourism attractions. The feasibility of incorporating geotourism as a component of this overall nature tourism thrust is explored in this paper. As a follow-up to this study a survey of tourism officials, natural resource professionals, and selected scientists of the region is proposed for the purpose of identifying the reasons and constraints preventing the Caribbean region from formally embracing geotourism, developing and promoting the geotourism resources of the region as a unique component of the overall tourism product.

Distinctiveness in the face of gene flow: hybridization between specialist and generalist gartersnakes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Patterns of divergence and polymorphism across hybrid zones can provide important clues as to their origin and maintenance. Unimodal hybrid zones or hybrid swarms are composed predominantly of recombinant individuals whose genomes are patchworks of alleles derived from each parental lineage. In contrast, bimodal hybrid zones contain few identifiable hybrids; most individuals fall within distinct genetic clusters. Distinguishing between hybrid swarms and bimodal hybrid zones can be important for taxonomic and conservation decisions regarding the status and value of hybrid populations. In addition, the causes of bimodality are important in understanding the generation and maintenance of biological diversity. For example, are distinct clusters mostly reproductively isolated and co-adapted gene complexes, or can distinctiveness be maintained by a few 'genomic islands' despite rampant gene flow across much of the genome? Here we focus on three patterns of distinctiveness in the face of gene flow between gartersnake taxa in the Great Lakes region of North America. Bimodality, the persistence of distinct clusters of genotypes, requires strong barriers to gene flow and supports recognition of distinct specialist (Thamnophis butleri) and generalist (Thamnophis radix) taxa. Concordance of DNA-based clusters with morphometrics supports the hypothesis that trophic morphology is a key component of divergence. Finally, disparity in the level of differentiation across molecular markers (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) indicates that distinctiveness is maintained by strong selection on a few traits despite high gene flow currently or in the recent past.

Structure of the eastern Seattle fault zone, Washington State: New insights from seismic reflection data	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												We identify and characterize the active Seattle fault zone (SFZ) east of Lake Washington with newly acquired seismic reflection data. Our results focus on structures observed in the upper I km below the cities of Bellevue, Sammamish, Newcastle, and Fall City, Washington. The SFZ appears as a broad zone of faulting and folding at the southern boundary of the Seattle basin and north edge of the Seattle uplift. We interpret the Seattle fault as a thrust fault that accommodates north-south shortening by forming a fault-propagation fold with a forelimb breakthrough. The blind tip of the main fault forms a synclinal growth fold (deformation front) that extends at least 8 km east of Vasa Park (west side of Lake Sammamish) and defines the south edge of the Seattle basin. South of the deformation front is the forelimb breakthrough fault, which was exposed in a trench at Vasa Park. The Newcastle Hills anticline, a broad anticline forming the north part of the Seattle uplift east of Lake Washington, is interpreted to lie between the main blind strand of the Seattle fault and a backthrust. Our profiles, on the northern limb of this anticline, consistently image north-dipping strata. A structural model for the SFZ east of Lake Washington is consistent with about 8 km of slip on the upper part of the Seattle fault, but the amount of motion is only loosely constrained.

Galaxias brevipinnis fed almost exclusively at night on the benthos, whereas both trout species fed mostly during the day on drifting and benthic prey. Larvae of Deleatidium (Ephemeroptera), Hydrobiosis and Oxyethira (Trichoptera), and Austrosimulium and Chironomidae (Diptera) were the major prey in the diets of all three fish species. Small prey made up a greater proportion of the diet of G. brevipinnis than for either trout species. All three species of fish were found primarily in riffles and runs in water depths of 0.1-0.3 m, with G. brevipinnis frequently being in faster-flowing areas (water velocity 0.8-1.1 m s-1) than was either trout species (water velocity 0.4-0.7 m s-1). These differences in pattern of diel feeding and microhabitat use no doubt lessen the interaction between the galaxiid and salmonid fish species.																			0067-1940						1991	42	4					423	433																WOS:A1991GB00700008
J	Ringrose, S				Ringrose, S			The geomorphological context of calcrete deposition in the Dalmore Downs area, northern territory, Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This work describes and provides tentative dates for a previously briefly recorded calcrete suite from semi-arid north-central Australia. The aim is to provide further insight into the nature of carbonate deposition in this area and thereby promote further research. The calcrete deposit occupies 3750 km(2) and appears to have once served as a conduit for ground-water flow towards the Barkly Tablelands playa system. Two major phases of calcrete precipitation are distinguished tentatively as occurring during the Mid- and Late Pleistocene. Geomorphological and SEM evidence suggest that an earlier phase culminated in the direct calcium carbonate precipitation of travertine mounds. These resulted from effusive ground-water flow, possibly along spring lines. This phase was succeeded by a period of longitudinal dune formation. During a later phase, non-pedogenic calcrete was precipitated between and beyond the mounds, apparently replacing former dunes. The presence of salts within the calcrete infers strong evaporative conditions suggesting that this later precipitation took place in the proximity of a saline lake, possibly palaeo-lake Barkly. Later stage aeolian activity appears to have reworked dune surfaces since the second stage of carbonate deposition.

Results from analysis of lake water isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) show that Lake Blektjarnen water isotope composition is responsive to the balance between evaporation and input water (E/l ratio). A high E/l ratio results from a dry and probably warmer climate, decreasing the relative importance of precipitation input. Under such conditions evaporation and atmospheric equilibration probably enrich lake water in O-18 and C-13, respectively, which is reflected in the isotopic composition of the carbonates in the lake. From the relatively positive Chara delta O-18 values we infer that conditions were dry and warm between 4400 and 4000 cal. a BP, whereas more negative values indicate that conditions were wetter and probably cooler between 4000 and 3000 cal. a BP. A drier climate is inferred from more positive values between 2500 and 1000 cal. a BP. However, a successive depletion after ca. 1750 cal. a BP, also detected in several other delta O-18 records (carbonate and diatom), suggest increasingly wetter conditions in Scandinavia after that time, which is probably related to increased strength of the zonal flow.

Eddy covariance measurements of surface energy budget and evaporation in a cool season over southern open water in Mississippi	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Eddy covariance measurements of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes were made over a large southern open water surface of Ross Barnett Reservoir (the Reservoir hereafter) in Mississippi during the cool season with frequent incursions of cold fronts from 1 September 2007 to 31 January 2008. The eddy covariance tower was located in the middle of the main body of the Reservoir with the tower fetches exceeding 2.0 km in all directions. The Reservoir was ice-free in winter and the water temperatures always decreased with depth. Over the entire cool season, the averaged water surface temperatures were 1.8 degrees C higher than the overlying air (i.e., positive temperature gradients that led to thermally convective conditions) and the averaged vapor pressure near the water surface was 0.8 kPa greater than the overlying air (i.e., positive vapor pressure gradients), though occasionally negative gradients for temperature and vapor pressure were also observed for short periods. On average, the wind speeds were considerably large (3.9 m s(-1)) to maintain adequate turbulent mixing mechanically. As a consequence of the combined effect of thermally and mechanically generated turbulent mixing, consistently positive H (with a mean H of 20.0 W m(-2)) and LE (with a mean LE of 80.0 W m(-2)) occurred during the entire season. These continuous energy losses via H and LE resulted in release of a large amount of energy stored in the water to the atmosphere. The mean Bowen ratio was low for this open water surface (i.e., 0.3), suggesting that most of the energy released from the water fueled evaporation rather than sensible heating of the atmosphere. Nighttime evaporative water losses were substantial, contributing to 45% of the total evaporative water loss in this cool season. Frequent incursions of cold fronts with windy, cold, and dry air masses significantly promoted turbulent exchanges of sensible and latent heat through enhanced turbulent mixing thermally and mechanically, leading to large H and LE events. Daily H and LE (i.e., evaporation) during the passages of cold fronts were on average 2.7 and 7.3 times those in nonevent days, respectively. Given the fact that large H and LE events occurred 26% of the time for our site, these cold front events caused an increase in the seasonal H by 42% and LE by 157%. Therefore changes in frequency, intensity, and duration of synoptic weather events, particularly the incursions of cold fronts,					Sheng, Johnysheng/M-3680-2014														2169-897X	2169-8996				FEB 21	2009	114								D04110	10.1029/2008JD010891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD010891													WOS:000263612500007

However, it is unclear how urbanization and its interaction with climate impact PBs, which has implications for the management of lakes. Here, we used multi-source remote sensing data and integrated the Virtual-Baseline Floating macroAlgae Height (VB-FAH) index and OTSU threshold automatic segmentation algorithm to extract the area of PBs in Lake Dianchi, China, which has been subjected to frequent PBs and rapid urbanization in its vicinity. We further explored long-term (2000-2021) trends in the phenological and severity metrics of PBs and quantified the contributions from urbanization, climate change, and also nutrient levels to these trends. When comparing data from 2011-2021 to 2000-2010, we found significantly advanced initiation of PBs (28.6 days) and noticeably longer duration (51.9 days) but an insignificant trend in time of disappearance. The enhancement of algal nutrient use efficiency, likely induced by increased water temperature and reduced nutrient concentrations, presumably contributed to an earlier initiation and longer duration of PBs, while there was a negative correlation between spring wind speed and the initiation of PBs. Fortunately, we found that both the area of the PBs and the frequency of severe blooms (covering more than 19.8 km(2)) demonstrated downward trends, which could be attributed to increased wind speed and/or reduced nutrient levels. Moreover, the enhanced land surface temperature caused by urbanization altered the thermodynamic characteristics between the land and the lake, which, in turn, possibly caused an increase in local wind speed and water temperature, suggesting that urbanization can differently regulate the phenology and severity of PBs. Our findings have significant implications for the understanding of the impacts of urbanization on PB dynamics and for improving lake management practices to promote sustainable urban development under global change.

C-14-Dating of the cores sediment at 3 different layers led to an numerical core age of about 8000 BP and the palynomorph content of prepared samples enabled reconstruction of the vegetation and climatic history of Nam Co Area. Pollen of Alpine Steppe elements together with Cyperaceae dominates the palynoflora reflecting the existing vegetation units around the lake throughout the investigated time span. Due to availability of water/precipitation, the different vegetation units extended or had to retreat, and hence the amount of their pollen increased or decreased. The presence of arboreal plants, verified by charcoal particles, suggest the existence of woodlands in the lake's surrounding area until possibly human made fires changed the environment over time. Holocene climate history around Nam Co shows several phases of a strengthening/weakening or even an interruption of monsoonal activity. Changing conditions between dry and humid evolved from 8017 BP until 4800 BR A mostly humid and relative stable system occurred from 4800 until 700 BP whereas the last 700 years are characterized by drier conditions according to fluctuating monsoonal activity. Humid or arid periods have been different in duration and intensity. The interaction of both parts of the monsoonal system, the South Asian Monsoon and the East Asian Monsoon, influenced the climatic conditions around Nam Co. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Geological controls and tidal forcing of submarine groundwater discharge from a confined aquifer in a coastal sand dune system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into the ocean is increasingly recognized as an important component of land-ocean interaction. Numerous geological settings may be the source of terrestrially derived SGD, including spatially extensive sand dune systems, which are a common coastal setting in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions throughout the world. Within the catchment of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, numerous large-scale sand dune systems exist. Creeks and rivers draining these systems are largely absent; however, terrestrially derived groundwater discharges from discrete springs in the intertidal zone. The geological and hydrological controls of the discharge were investigated, using a combination of geological, geophysical, and hydrological methods. From sedimentary and geoelectric data it is inferred that a unit of sandy clay provides a confinement of the shallow aquifer system in the dune complex, with groundwater discharging where this layer is breached. Groundwater discharge flux was inversely correlated with tidal water level, but remained positive throughout the tidal cycle. A simple hydrological model indicates that the continuous discharge is the result of a change in hydraulic pressure of the confined aquifer in response to tidal forcing at the seaward limit of the aquitard, which is a previously undescribed effect of tidal modulation of SGD. The observed groundwater discharge is likely to have a significant effect on the biogeochemistry of the coastal environment, particularly in the absence of surface water drainage.					; Stieglitz, Thomas/C-7916-2013; Ridd, Peter/M-5871-2014	Stieglitz, Thomas/0000-0002-2946-391X; Stieglitz, Thomas/0000-0002-7349-4254; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 19	2007	112	C4							C04015	10.1029/2006JC003580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JC003580													WOS:000245953000001
J	Hafeez, MA; Inoue, T				Hafeez, Muhammad Ali; Inoue, Tetsunori			Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling of saltwater ingression and circulation in a Brackish Lake Shinji, Japan	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Lake Shinji is a mesohaline lake that has intermittent saline water intrusion from its east coast connection of Ohashi River. This intrusion is often in the shape of a very thin layer that moves along the Lake bottom and stayed at the center due to bowl shape bathymetry of the Lake having maximum depth at the center. To elucidate the intrusion mechanism a 3-D hydrodynamic model (EcoPARI) was employed in a hindcast mode covering the year 2012 from the beginning of January to the end of September. Initially, the core emphasis was given to the vertical turbulence diffusion model and optimum model parameters were determined to accurately simulate the hydrodynamics. It was highlighted by the numerical simulations that alteration of one model constant, which is the multiplying coefficient of Richardson number, "alpha", is influential instead of altering all the constants to tune the turbulence model. The possibility of using differential model constants for temperature and salinity was also tested and it helped in the improvement of simulations. Finally, the performance of the model was also assessed under extreme weather conditions and a historical upwelling event was simulated. The model was able to reproduce the intrusion in the summer months as well as the upwelling event in September due to strong westerly winds caused by a nearby passing typhoon.

The impact and significance of tephra deposition on a Holocene forest environment in the North Cascades, Washington, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution palaeoecological analyses (stratigraphy, tephra geochemistry, radiocarbon dating, pollen and ordination) were used to reconstruct a Holocene vegetation history of a watershed in the Pacific Northwest of America to evaluate the effects and duration of tephra deposition on a forest environment and the significance of these effects compared to long-term trends. Three tephra deposits were detected and evaluated: MLF-T158 and MLC-T324 from the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama, MLC-T480 from a Late Pleistocene eruption of Mount Mazama and MLC-T485 from a Glacier Peak eruption. Records were examined from both the centre and fringe of the basin to elucidate regional and local effects. The significance of tephra impacts independent of underlying long-term trends was confirmed using partial redundancy analysis. Tephra deposition from the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama approximately 7600 cal. years BP caused a significant local impact, reflected in the fringe location by changes to open habitat vegetation (Cyperaceae and Poaceae) and changes in aquatic macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton, Equisetum and the alga Pediastrum). There was no significant impact of the climactic Mazama tephra or other tephras detected on the pollen record of the central core. Changes in this core are potentially climate driven. Overall, significant tephra fall was demonstrated through high resolution analyses indicating a local effect on the terrestrial and aquatic environment, but there was no significant impact on the regional forest dependent of underlying environmental changes.

Jacquot Island hares averaged twice the density of mainland control populations and, although they show 10-year cycles, fluctuate with much lower amplitude than mainland populations. Three separate intensive studies over 6 years attempted to determine what caused these differences. We tested two hypotheses to explain the dynamics. Reproductive rates of hares were similar on Jacquot Island and the mainland. Adult survival rates were higher on the island in most years, with the exception of years of population decline. Juvenile survival rates from 0 to 30 days of life were much higher on the island than on the mainland except for decline summers. The adult- and juvenile-survival differences between the island and the mainland were explained most consistently by predation. Improved survival on the island is correlated with a reduction in the numbers and types of predators found on Jacquot Island compared with the mainland. In particular, red squirrels were rare on Jacquot Island, arctic ground squirrels were absent, and the larger predators, like lynx and great-horned owls, were sporadic in occurrence on this small island.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	2002	80	8					1442	1450		10.1139/Z02-143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z02-143													WOS:000178786400013

However, deciphering how alluvial fans respond to orbital-scale climate fluctuations remains unclear. While some alluvial fans exhibit a distinct response to glacial-interglacial cycles, others do not. This detailed outcrop study of the late Quaternary Bantanzi alluvial fan in the Daihai Lake Basin, northern China, reveals two stratigraphic intervals with distinct facies, where a lower stratigraphic succession is dominated by debris flow deposits and palaeosols and a higher stratigraphic unit by flash-flood deposits and loess. Physical correlations to well-dated successions on the Chinese Loess Plateau provide a chronological framework. The palaeosols and the elevated values in magnetic susceptibility of the debris flow-dominated interval, dated 88.1 to 73.4 ka (the last interglacial period MIS5, 130 to 70 ka), indicate a climate with intense seasonal monsoon rainfall, which facilitated chemical weathering and saturation of clay-rich sediments on hillslopes triggering debris flows. The wind-blown loess deposits together with regional data in the flash flood-dominated interval, dated 58.5 to 22.1 ka (the last glacial period MIS 2 to 4, 70 to 14 ka), indicate an arid climate with highly intermittent and short-duration rainfall. Such rainfall conditions tend to promote rapid run-off and generate flash floods, as well as hinder hillslope saturation and chemical weathering resulting in a regolith with higher permeability and erodibility, hindering high pore pressures from building up and promoting erosion by run-off. These distinct climatic conditions between interglacial and glacial periods were controlled by the latitudinal shift of the margin of the East Asian Monsoon. The Bantanzi fan's position at this climatic boundary, coupled with its small size, made it highly sensitive to glacial-interglacial cycles. Comparison with other fan systems suggests that the position of alluvial fans at distinct climate boundaries, rather than within the climate zones, is an important control on their sensitivity to climate changes and their potential as climate-change archives.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	2025	72	5					1375	1401		10.1111/sed.70006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.70006		APR 2025											WOS:001476872300001

Sedimentary facies associations and sequence stratigraphy of source and reservoir rocks of the lacustrine Eocene Niubao Formation (Lunpola Basin, central Tibet)	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Eocene Niubao Formation of the Lunpola Basin, a large Cenozoic intermontane basin in central Tibet, is an important potential hydrocarbon source and reservoir unit. It represents 20 Myr of lacustrine sedimentation in a half-graben with a sharply fault-bounded northern margin and a low-angle flexural southern margin, resulting in a highly asymmetric distribution of depositional fades and sediment thicknesses along the N-S axis of the basin. An integrated investigation of well-logs, seismic data, cores and outcrops revealed three third-order sequences (SQ1 to SQ3), each representing a cycle of rising and falling lake levels yielding Lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tracts. Lowstand systems tracts (LST) include delta and fan delta facies spread widely along the gentle southern margin and concentrated narrowly along the steep northern margin of the basin, with sublacustrine fan sand bodies extending into the basin center. Highstand systems tracts (HST) include expanded areas of basin-center shale deposition, with sublacustrine fans, deltas and fan deltas locally developed along the basin margins. Sequence development may reflect episodes of tectonic uplift and base-level changes. The southern margin of the basin exhibits two different structural styles that locally influenced sequence development, i.e., a multi-step fault belt in the south-central sector and a flexure belt in the southeastern sector. The sedimentary model and sequence stratigraphic framework developed in this study demonstrate that N2 (the middle member of Niubao Formation) exhibits superior hydrocarbon potential, characterized by thicker source rocks and a wider distribution of sand-body reservoirs, although N3 (the upper member of Niubao Formation) also has good potential.

Prey Availability, Consumption, and Quality Contribute to Variation in Growth of Subyearling Chinook Salmon Rearing in Riverine and Reservoir Habitats	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined prey availability, prey consumed, and diet energy content as sources of variation in growth of natural fall Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha subyearlings rearing in riverine and reservoir habitats in the Snake River. Subyearlings in riverine habitat primarily consumed aquatic insects (e.g., Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera), of which a high proportion was represented by adult, terrestrial forms. In the reservoir, subyearlings also consumed aquatic insects but also preyed heavily at times on nonnative lentic amphipods Corophium spp. and the mysid Neomysis mercedis, which were absent in riverine habitats. The availability of prey was typically much higher in the reservoir due to N. mercedis often composing over 90% of the biomass, but when this taxon was removed from consideration, biomass estimates were more often higher in the riverine habitat. Subyearling diets during 2009-2011were generally 17-40% higher in energy in the riverine habitat than in the reservoir. Observed growth in both length and weight were significantly higher in the riverine habitat than in the reservoir. Little is known about how temporal and spatial changes in the food web in large river landscapes influence populations of native anadromous fishes. Our results provide a glimpse of how the spread and establishment of nonnative prey species can reduce juvenile salmon growth in a large river impoundment, which in turn can affect migration timing and survival.

Ninety-nine percent of the Austrian population is supplied with spring and groundwater, whereas the share of treated surface water of 1% is very small compared to many other European countries. At present, 89% of the population is connected to public sewerage systems with corresponding wastewater treatment. Besides protecting lakes, rivers and streams, particular emphasis placed on the protection of groundwater which is used as important drinking water resource. Results show that most parameters related to drinking water quality are well below the specified limit values. In general, Austria applies the principle of country-wide groundwater protection. About 9% of the territory of Austria is subject to specific water supply protection regulations. The current status of the EU Water Framework Directive implementation in Austria includes the analysis and status assessment of the Austrian river basin districts which were rated and classified by the level of risk of failing to reach the required good status. The next activities will include the drawing up of the first national river basin management plans, adapting the water quality monitoring network and restoring those water bodies failing to meet the defined objectives.																			1871-4668		978-1-4020-8556-7				2008							21	49		10.1007/978-1-4020-8558-1_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8558-1_3													WOS:000258124000003

Azerbaijan having the world's 9 of the 11 different climatic sorts in itself has provided a great recreation and health tourism. The tourism activities in Azerbaijan are mostly on recreation which encompasses thermal springs of the Caspian Sea's beaches. In these circumstances, the recreation depending on the interior tourism, seashore tourism as well as thermal tourism has been gained popularity and this revives the health tourism. Many kinds of thermal and healing water, volcanic mud, salty healing lake mud, and healing mud which comes from oil wells show how appropriate these circumstances are for Azerbaijan's health tourism. On the other hand, Azerbaijan having high relief areas such as Buyuk Kafkas, Kucuk Kafkas and Talis Mountains has a great potential on mountains and hunting tourism. As is seen, tourism activities in Azerbaijan contain different characteristics. However, what is significant here is creating these different areas as a sector to contribute the to country's economy.																			1300-5766						2006		20					255	272																WOS:000421791300016
J	Schlichtholz, P				Schlichtholz, Pawel			Upper-tropospheric bridging of wintertime surface climate variability in the Euro-Atlantic region and northern Asia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												A remarkable feature of interannual climate variability is a robust link of wintertime anomalies of surface air temperature (SAT) in northern Asia to pan-Atlantic SAT variations associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Here statistical analyses of data from the era of satellite observations (1979-2017) are used to show that about 80% of the variance of the winter (December-March) mean area-averaged SAT anomalies in northern Asia can be explained by the anomalous surface circulation associated with an NAO-like mode of sea level pressure variability over extratropical Eurasia. These SAT anomalies are related equally strongly to the "Lake Baikal" vortex representing variations of the upper-tropospheric circulation over northern Asia. Support is given for the scenario that this vortex drives SAT anomalies in northern Asia via surface-reaching displacements of isentropic surfaces and that it is coupled to climate variability in the Euro-Atlantic sector via interactions between the North Atlantic storm track, quasi-stationary planetary waves, and zonal-mean zonal winds. The results underpin the importance of a lesser-known zonal wavenumber-3 structure of disturbances trapped over Eurasia by the polar front jet rather than the better-known zonal wave number-5 structure of disturbances trapped by the subtropical jet for NAO teleconnections.

This study aimed to explore the possibilities of estimating plant protein and phosphorus contents, with the laboratory-based hyperspectral measurements of fresh Carex leaves, which are the main food source of many wintering bird species in Poyang Lake, China. Fifty-four Carex leaf samples were collected, and their hyperspectral reflectance (at 350-2500nm) and crude protein and phosphorus contents were measured in the laboratory. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) was applied for spectral dimension reduction, and a multiple linear regression model was calibrated to estimate the crude protein and phosphorus contents from the wavelengths selected with the SPA. The model validation results showed that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of estimation were 2.51% for crude protein and 0.06% for phosphorus. Compared with a multiple linear model with randomly selected inputs and full-spectrum partial least-square regression (PLSR), the multiple linear regression model combined with the SPA method exhibited a significant advantage in terms of accuracy in estimating the crude protein and phosphorus contents of Carex leaves.					邬国锋/B-8735-2018; Fei, Teng/B-8552-2009	fei, teng/0000-0002-3415-1654; Liu, Yaolin/0000-0002-4619-5099; 													0143-1161						2013	34	5					1866	1878		10.1080/01431161.2012.730158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.730158													WOS:000323247900020
J	Pilla, RM; Williamson, CE				Pilla, Rachel M.; Williamson, Craig E.			Multidecadal trends in ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and dissolved oxygen have altered vertical habitat availability for Daphnia in temperate Lake Giles, USA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Long-term browning has resulted in increases in dissolved organic carbon and reduced water clarity that have altered the vertical physical structure of many lake ecosystems. The primary responses include reduced ultraviolet (UV) penetration, warming surface waters, and decreased deepwater dissolved oxygen concentrations that interactively alter vertical habitat suitability for zooplankton. Over 3 decades, Daphnia populations have decreased in abundance and shallowed in their vertical distribution in temperate Lake Giles (Pennsylvania, USA). Using 3 decades of corresponding long-term vertical profile data of UV radiation, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen, we modelled both the suitable vertical habitat and thermally optimal habitat for Daphnia to understand the potential role of habitat availability for their population dynamics. The vertical extent of suitable habitat increased over time primarily due to strong decreases in UV penetration. In contrast, thermally optimal habitat decreased due to strong increases in vertical thermal gradients that were especially strong in late summer. The vertical distribution of Daphnia became shallower over this time period and may be a response to lower UV exposure near the surface, but continued warming of surface waters and decreasing deepwater dissolved oxygen concentrations are likely to lead to a vertical habitat squeeze. The biological implications of long-term browning require more attention due to the complex and important implications for population dynamics, species interactions, and food web structure in lakes.

David A.; Zhang, Hucai; Duan, Lizeng; Shen, Caiming; Sun, Huiling			Dissolved oxygen concentrations influence the distribution of isoGDGTs in a deep Lake Fuxian in China: Implications for the use of TEX86 in stratified lakes	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The TEX86 (tetraether index of 86 carbon atoms) temperature proxy has been widely applied to marine settings. The application of TEX86 in lakes, however, is more complicated, as many other factors, such as dissolved oxygen (DO), also appear to influence the lacustrine TEX86 signal. In order to better understand how DO content affects TEX86 , we analyzed an annual cycle of isoGDGT distributions and abundances in the water column (0-100 m) of Lake Fuxian, in southwest China. It appears that isoGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the water column are mainly produced by aquatic Group I.1a Thaumarchaeota. The peak concentration of total isoGDGTs occurs mainly in June and December, which is probably driven by release of nutrients during phytoplankton blooms with a lag of about one month. About 95% of isoGDGTs occurred in the bottom water layer (hypolim-nion) of this thermally stratified lake, indicating that Thaumarchaeota prefer to live in suboxic water conditions in Lake Fuxian. IsoGDGT-2 is the most sensitive component to monthly variations in DO contents. This rela-tionship leads to a similar negative correlation between TEX86 and DO. When TEX86 values, especially at the hypolimnion, are lower than anticipated, this is caused by %isoGDGT-2 falling below 45%. Conversely, a warm bias of TEX86 arising from a %isoGDGT-2 greater than 45% appears to be associated with lower DO contents. Therefore, this threshold of %isoGDGT-2 could be used in future paleoclimate reconstructions (of Lake Fuxian, and possibly similar lakes), especially since Thaumarchaeota typically reside at suboxic water layers.

J	Lowe, DJ				Lowe, David J.			Using Soil Stratigraphy and Tephrochronology to Understand the Origin, Age, and Classification of a Unique Late Quaternary Tephra-Derived Ultisol in Aotearoa New Zealand	QUATERNARY												In this article, I show how an Ultisol, representative of a globally-important group of soils with clay-rich subsoils, low base saturation, and low fertility, in the central Waikato region in northern North Island, can be evaluated using soil stratigraphy and tephrochronology to answer challenging questions about its genesis, age and classification. The Kainui soil, a Typic Kandiudult (Soil Taxonomy) and Buried-granular Yellow Ultic Soil (New Zealand Soil Classification), occurs on low rolling hills of Mid-Quaternary age mainly in the Hamilton lowlands in, and north and northeast of, Hamilton city. It is a composite, multi-layered tephra-derived soil consisting of two distinct parts, upper and lower. The upper part is a coverbed typically c. 0.4-0.7 m in thickness (c. 0.6 m on average) comprising numerous late Quaternary rhyolitic and andesitic tephras that have been accumulating incrementally since c. 50 ka (the age of Rotoehu Ash at the coverbed's base) whilst simultaneously being pedogenically altered (i.e., forming soil horizons) via developmental upbuilding pedogenesis during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages (MOIS) 3-1. Any original depositional (fall) bedding has been almost entirely masked by pedogenic alteration. Sediments in lakes aged c. 20 ka adjacent to the low hills have preserved around 40 separate, thin, macroscopic tephra-fall beds mainly rhyolitic in composition, and equivalent subaerial deposits together form the upper c. 30 cm of the coverbed. Okareka (c. 21.8 ka), Okaia (c. 28.6 ka), Tahuna (c. 39.3 ka) and (especially) Rotoehu tephras make up the bulk of the lower c. 30 cm of the coverbed. Tephra admixing has occurred throughout the coverbed because of soil upbuilding processes. Moderately well drained, this upper profile is dominated by halloysite (not allophane) in the clay fraction because of limited desilication. In contrast, Otorohanga soils, on rolling hills to the south of Hamilton, are formed in equivalent but thicker (>c. 0.8 m) late Quaternary tephras <= c. 50 ka that are somewhat more andesitic although predominantly rhyolitic overall. These deeper soils are well drained with strong desilication and thus are allophanic, generating Typic Hapludands. Ubiquitous redox features, together with short-lived contemporary reduction observed in the lower coverbed of a Kainui soil profile, indicate that the Kainui soil in general is likely to be saturated by perching for several days, or near saturation for several months, each year. The perching occurs because the coverbed overlies a slowly-permeable, buried, clay-rich paleosol on upper Hamilton Ash beds, >c. 50 ka in age, which makes up the lower part of the two-storeyed Kainui soil. The coverbed-paleosol boundary is a lithologic discontinuity (unconformity). Irregular in shape, it represents a tree-overturn paleosurface that may be c. 74 ka in age (MOIS 5/4 boundary). The buried paleosol is markedly altered and halloysitic with relict clay skins (forming paleo-argillic and/or paleo-kandic horizons) and redoximorphic features. It is inferred to have formed via developmental upbuilding pedogenesis during the Last Interglacial (MOIS 5e). The entire Hamilton Ash sequence, c. 3 m in thickness and overlain unconformably by Rotoehu Ash and underlain by c. 340-ka Rangitawa Tephra at the base, represents a thick composite (accretionary) set of clayey, welded paleosols developed by upbuilding pedogenesis from MOIS 10 to 5.

Erratics perched on bedrock outboard of the Drygalski Moraines constrain local deglaciation to similar to 9.9 +/- 0.6 ka (n = 2). Three Drygalski Moraine crests yield mean Be-10 ages of 8.6 +/- 0.4 ka (n = 2), 8.5 +/- 0.2 ka (n = 3), and 7.6 +/- 0.1 ka (n = 2) from outer to inner. Perched erratics between the inner two moraines average 7.8 +/- 0.1 ka (n = 2) and are consistent with the moraine ages. Sediments from a proglacial lake with a catchment area extending an estimated 2 km beneath (inland of) the present ice sheet terminus constrain an ice sheet minimum extent from 5.4 ka to 0.6 ka. The moraine chronology paired with the lake sediment stratigraphy reveals that the ice margin likely remained within similar to 2 km of its present position from similar to 9.9 to 5.4 ka. This unexpected early Holocene stability, preceded by rapid ice retreat and followed by minimum ice extent between similar to 5.4 and 0.6 ka, contrasts with many records of early Holocene warmth and the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation maximum. We suggest ice margin stability may instead be tied to adjacent ocean temperatures, which reached an optimum in the middle Holocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Propagation of uncertainty in ecological models of reservoirs: From physical to population dynamic predictions	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecological models are widely accepted in the scientific community as tools to describe, interpret and predict ecosystem functioning. However, to be used in environmental management, model uncertainties, their magnitude and sources need to be carefully assessed. A one-dimensional coupled physical-ecological model is applied to a deep Mediterranean reservoir (Lake Beznar) to determine whether or not the uncertainty existing in physical predictions affects ecological predictions, and, then to quantify this uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty include light penetration in the water column, inflow mixing and geometry, and boundary conditions at free surface. Uncertainty in the model results was evaluated following the procedures outlined in Beven (2001), based on Montecarlo simulations. At least during summer time, the largest sources of uncertainty in the physical predictions are associated to the input variables used to construct the surface (heat and momentum) boundary conditions. Uncertainties in the physical model propagate to the ecological results. Average chlorophyll-a concentration predicted by the ecological module in the water column, their standard deviations, and the timings of the successional changes in the algal community all vary depending on the magnitude of the error accepted in the physical predictions. Our results illustrate that the analysis and quantification of model uncertainty are fundamental to properly express model results and, consequently, to optimize monitoring programmes and guide management decisions.

J	HOLKER, F; HAMMER, C				HOLKER, F; HAMMER, C			GROWTH AND FOOD OF RUFFE GYMNOCEPHALUS-CERNUUS (L) IN THE ELBE ESTUARY	ARCHIVE OF FISHERY AND MARINE RESEARCH												In summer 1991, ruffe of the Elbe River Estuary were investigated. Females were found to have a L(infinity) of 26.1 cm TL and a W(infinity) of 279 g. Values for males were 23.3 cm and 193 g, respectively. The growth performance was comparatively good with P = 2.04 for females and a value of 1.97 for males. A comparison with literature data indicates that ruffe growth performance has improved during the past decades. For the length class 16.5-20 cm (AG approx. III-IV) males were predominant, whereas for 20.5-22.5 cm (AG approx. IV-V) the females were dearly more abundant. This indicates significantly better female growth. All animals larger than 23 cm were exclusively females. The food of ruffe consisted chiefly of Neomysis integer, Crangon crangon, Osmerus eperlanus and Gammarus zaddachi. For G. zaddachi and N. integer the prey size did not increase significantly with predator size. By contrast, a significant increase of prey size with fish size was found for C. crangon, and most conspicuously for O. eperlanus. The latter were taken only by ruffe larger than 17.5 cm. Smaller individuals were evidently unable to feed on smelt.

J	Guo, XR; Guo, JP; Zhang, DL; Yun, YX				Guo, Xiaoran; Guo, Jianping; Zhang, Da-Lin; Yun, Yuxing			Vertical divergence profiles as detected by two wind-profiler mesonets over East China: Implications for nowcasting convective storms	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Low-level convergence is one of the most important dynamic variables in governing the convection initiation (CI) and development of storms. However, our ability to obtain high-resolution horizontal divergence profiles remains limited due to the lack of high-resolution vertical wind observations. In this study, horizontal divergence (and vertical motion) profiles are derived from horizontal winds measured by two radar wind-profiler (RWP) mesonets in East China, and then used to examine their relationship with CI occurring within a mesonet and an intense squall line moving across another mesonet. Results show that the RWP mesonets together with automated surface observations could provide realistically the lower-tropospheric profiles of horizontal divergence (and upward motion) associated with the CI in the presence of the urban heat island effects, and lake and sea breezes; and the evolution of the squall line respectively. High-resolution surface observations resolve better divergence induced by localized CI than the RWP measurements, whereas the latter capture well significant convergence below 4-km altitude that precedes the onset of squall precipitation. A statistical analysis of the RWP data during the summer months of 2018 indicates that the lower-tropospheric convergence can be detected up to about 40 min in advance of the occurrence of heavy rainfall, and the correlation is higher when it is closer to the heavy rainfall time. Nearly 40% of heavy rainfall moments (at 6-min intervals) are accompanied by strong convergence signals occurring mostly near the top of the boundary layer. This work indicates that the RWP and surface wind measurements should be integrated to aid in nowcasting the location and timing of CI and development of convective storms.

J	Meltzer, DJ				Meltzer, DJ			Human responses to middle Holocene (Altithermal) climates on the north American Great Plains	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The climate of the Great Plains during the middle Holocene varied considerably, but overall it was marked by a north-south gradient of increasingly warmer and drier conditions, with a reduction in effective moisture, surface water, and resource abundance, and an increase in resource patchiness, sediment weathering, erosion, and aeolian activity. Pronounced drought conditions were most evident on the Southern High Plains. Understanding the human responses to middle Holocene climates is complicated by a lack of archaeological data, which is partly a result of geomorphic processes that removed or deeply buried sites of this age, and by the varying adaptive responses of hunter-gatherers during this period. On the Southern High Plains, where drought was most severe, surface and groundwater sources dried and bison populations were diminished, prompting substantial adaptive changes, including local abandonment, well-digging to tap underground water, and a widening of the diet breadth to incorporate higher-cost, lower-return seed and plant resources. Sites of this age on the Central and Northern Plains also show a possible increase in diet breadth (with the incorporation of plant foods in the diet), and perhaps changes in settlement mobility (including possible shift into higher elevation areas, or mapping-on to extant rivers and springs). But linking those changes to middle Holocene drought is less straightforward. (C) 1999 University of Washington.

Part two: a regional modeling study	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												The impact of the changes on soil cover and land use brought about by the construction of the Sobradinho Dam in the semi-arid region of the Sao Francisco River Hydrographic Basin is analyzed by means of a numerical model RAMS. Disregarding the influence of a large scale flow, a set of factors were responsible for the creation of a rather complex circulation system that includes mountain-valley winds, lake breeze (LB) and non-conventional circulation all induced by the surface non-homogeneous aspect. Results have demonstrated that the implementation of works of such magnitude brings about environmental changes in an area that stretches far beyond the surroundings of the reservoir. The soil cover alterations due to the ever increasing development of the area with the presence of irrigated crops in a sparsely vegetated region (caatinga) does affect land surface characteristics, occasioning for that matter the splitting of the available energy into latent and sensible heat fluxes. LB behavior varies in accordance with atmospheric conditions and also in view of the type of vegetation found in the lake surrounding areas. Hydro availability in root zones, even under adverse atmospheric conditions (high temperature and low air humidity) brings up the high rates of evaporation and plant transpiration that contribute towards the increase of humidity and the fall of temperature in lower atmospheric layers.					da Silva Aragão, Maria/AAD-4633-2020; correia, magaly/AAD-3591-2020	Correia, Magaly/0000-0002-8681-7462; 													0177-7971	1436-5065				NOV	2006	94	1-4					115	128		10.1007/s00703-005-0174-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00703-005-0174-3													WOS:000241612500008
J	Mattheus, CR				Mattheus, C. Robin			Changing water levels and sandy barrier morphodynamics, eastern lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Although sandy barriers are a key component of many Great Lakes coastal wetlands, little is known about their geomorphic development in response to water-level changes, despite widespread implications for hydrology and ecology. This paper addresses the morphodynamic development of the Sandy Pond barrier, eastern Lake Ontario, which underwent a sudden change in base-level regime with the onset of regulatory practices. The creation of new inlets with coeval closing of pre-existing ones, which had previously been coupled to shifts in base water level > 1 m, has not occurred since restriction of the natural lake-level oscillatory range. Barrier breaching is facilitated by decadal lake-level highs and inlet stability by entrenchment during lake-level fall and lowstand conditions. Water-level extremes have been absent since the 1970s, with stunting of the decadal oscillatory change signature (to < 1 m of variance) and a mean level above that of the pre-regulatory period. Rather than persistence of the cyclic dynamics of barrier-breaching and channel entrenchment (associated with abandonment elsewhere), the new conditions promoted lateral migration of the present channel and the formation of recurved beach ridges along the updrift inlet side. This morphology is not recognized in relict depositional architectures associated with former known inlet positions. While estuarine flushing capacity continues to be maintained (by constant inlet-channel dimensions), there are implications of this new geomorphic trajectory for barrier-landform succession and ecology.																			1400-0350	1874-7841				OCT	2023	27	5							52	10.1007/s11852-023-00976-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-023-00976-6													WOS:001078590900001
J	Costa, M; Liss, PS				Costa, M; Liss, PS			Photoreduction of mercury in sea water and its possible implications for Hg0 air-sea fluxes	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Scientific Meeting on Studies in Chemical Oceanography in Honour of J Dennis Burton	SEP, 1997	SOUTHAMPTON OCEANOG CTR, SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND		SOUTHAMPTON OCEANOG CTR			Mercury photoreduction in the presence of humic substances was investigated in laboratory experiments by means of a radiochemical technique. The seawater samples used were from the North Sea, and the light source was natural sunlight on a summer's day at temperate latitude. The reduction reaction Hg2+ --> HgO was observed to occur at different humic concentrations and light regimes. The results presented here are in the form of the percent of initial total mercury which was reduced and degassed from the solution with time. The reaction rate increased with humic concentration and the presence of light. The reaction rates varied from near zero in the case of the dark reaction in the: absence of humic material to around 2% h(-1) in a 5-mg l(-1) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) irradiated solution. Elemental mercury fluxes calculated from data obtained during this work are compared with fluxes reported in the literature. The consequences of mercury reduction and evasion from the solution are discussed in the light of the fluxes of gaseous mercury which can potentially be generated from the water when the photochemical reduction reaction takes place. The photochemically driven fluxes calculated are shown to be potentially significant contributors to the fluxes reported in the literature for at least some of the environments tested.

J	Kostic, B; Becht, A; Aigner, T				Kostic, B; Becht, A; Aigner, T			3-D sedimentary architecture of a Quaternary gravel delta (SW-Germany): Implications for hydrostratigraphy	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												This paper investigates a Quaternary Gilbert-type gravel delta that was formed in an ice-marginal environment at the end of the last glacial period. Outcrop, sediment core and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) studies reveal the sedimentary facies and depositional architecture of the delta that comprises three major units: (1) a 2-5 m thick, gravelly topset with an erosional base, formed by accretion of bedload sheets in a braided river; (2) an up to 40 m thick, steeply. inclined (13-35 degrees) foreset, dominated by gravelly lithofacies being the product of cohesionless debris flows and debris falls as well as gravity slides while sandy lithofacies was deposited by traction currents; and (3) a 10-20 m thick, sandy bottomset comprising low-density turbidites. Syn-to postdepositional deformation of parts of the bottomset deposits largely resulted from rapid deposition of overlying gravels and differential loading of the prograding foreset beds. The development of the delta was most likely controlled by a high sediment supply and lake level fluctuations. The overall coarsening-upward succession reflects delta progradation and aggradation into a glaciolacustrine environment. Outcrop sedimentology served as a direct analogue in order to characterise the three-dimensional sedimentary and hydraulic architecture of the nearby gravel-delta aquifer. Applying a multidisciplinary approach, sedimentological, geophysical, and hydrogeological data were integrated within the 3-D modelling package Gocad (Earth Decision Sciences) to develop high-resolution 3-D aquifer models.

Although area-based gross primary productivity (1.43-11.65 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) falls within the range already established for tropical water bodies, net daily rate was negative in three water bodies. Light-saturated optimum rates were found in water bodies, with relatively high algal biomass, but photosynthetic efficiency or specific rates were higher in water bodies with low algal biomass, indicating nutrient limitation or physiological adaptation of phytoplankton. Concentrations of micronutrients and algal biomass in the reservoirs are largely altered by high flushing rate resulting from irrigation release. Underwater light climate and nutrient availability control the rate of photosynthesis and subsequent area-based primary production to a great extent. However, morpho-edephic index or euphotic algal biomass in the most productive stratum of the water column is not a good predictor of photosynthetic capacity or daily rate of primary production of these shallow tropical irrigation reservoirs.					; Amarasinghe, Upali/AAI-7435-2021	Amarasinghe, Upali S./0000-0002-0465-6950; 													0018-8158					OCT	2002	485	1-3					19	33		10.1023/A:1021310119462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021310119462													WOS:000179640500002

Annual recruitment is correlated with reproductive success in a smallmouth bass population	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Annual recruitment in fish is undoubtedly impacted by a vast number of biotic and abiotic factors. That is especially the case for fish species such as the black bass (species in the genus Micropterus), where there is extended parental care. Although much focus has been given in the past on determining the roles that many of these factors (e.g., temperatures, wind, flow rates, and habitat change) play in determining recruitment among the back basses, little attention has been given to assessing what role reproductive success plays in that determination. To address this question, we conducted a long-term study on two adjacent smallmouth bass (SMB) Micropterus dolomieu Lacepede, 1802 populations in eastern ON to assess the relationship between annual fry cohort size (FCS) (i.e., population-wide reproductive success) and annual recruitment. To measure population-wide annual FCS, we used snorkel surveys to conduct a complete census of nesting SMB males during the spawn from 1990 to 2015. During those surveys, we quantified mating success, determined which nests were successful or not, and calculated the number of independent fry produced each year by summing those numbers across all successful nests. Summer snorkel surveys from 1991 to 2016 assessed annual recruitment through visual counts of age 1+ juveniles. Results demonstrated a highly significant, positive, linear relationship between annual FCS and annual recruitment.

J	Cooperman, MS; Markle, DF				Cooperman, MS; Markle, DF			The Endangered Species Act and the National Research Council's interim judgment in Klamath Basin	FISHERIES												The controversial 2001 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service water allocation decision in the Klamath Basin has been portrayed as an example of scientific guesswork operating under a flawed Endangered Species Act. This conclusion has been based on an interim National Research Council report, quickly prepared in late fall 2001. We have reviewed several iterations of the NRC Interim Report as well as ail Biological Opinions and management documents related to Klamath Basin suckers and provide an overview. The 2001 Biological Opinion and the Interim Report illustrate the lack of consensus typical of scientists in the early stages of exploring a complex system. Unfortunately, the Biological Opinion created hardship for a small group of people and the lack of scientific consensus has politicized the debate. Politicians have assumed that the Interim Report has primacy in the scientific debate when, in fact, its speedy construction contributed to multiple errors that detract from its scientific usefulness. The NRC Interim Report has, instead, primarily served to deflect debate away from the needs of listed fishes to one about shortcomings in the Endangered Species Act. Although the process of science has been served by both the 2001 Biological Opinion and the Interim Report, both have shortcomings, and we see no justification for either side labeling the other's decisions or conclusions as "not sound science.".																			0363-2415					MAR	2003	28	3					10	19		10.1577/1548-8446(2003)28[10:TESAAT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(2003)28[10:TESAAT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181503700006

Diverse juvenile life-history behaviours contribute to the spawning stock of an anadromous fish population	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Habitat quality often varies substantially across space and time, producing a shifting mosaic of growth and mortality trade-offs across watersheds. Traditional studies of juvenile habitat use have emphasised the evolution of single optimal strategies that maximise recruitment to adulthood and eventual fitness. However, linking the distribution of individual behaviours that contribute to recruitment at the population level has been elusive, particularly for highly fecund aquatic organisms. We examined juvenile habitat use within a population of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in a watershed consisting of two interconnected lakes and a marine lagoon. Otolith microchemical analysis revealed that the productive headwater lake accounted for about half of juvenile growth for those individuals surviving to spawn in a single river in the upper watershed. However, 47% of adults had achieved more than half of their juvenile growth in the downstream less productive lake, and 3% of individuals migrated to the estuarine environment during their first summer and returned to freshwater to overwinter before migrating back to sea. These results describe a diversity of viable habitat-use strategies by juvenile sockeye salmon that may buffer the population against poor conditions in any single rearing environment, reduce density-dependent mortality and have implications for the designation of critical habitat for conservation purposes. A network of accessible alternative habitats providing trade-offs in growth and survival may be important for long-term viability of populations.

It is now possible, however, to automatically monitor many parameters using in-situ sensors and to provide remote web-based access to these data. Such data are typically provided at frequencies of minutes rather than at the weekly, fortnightly or monthly intervals typical of traditional monitoring and therefore capture both short-term change and, for inter-annual deployments, long-term trends. Here we give an overview of the use of high frequency monitoring (HFM) in Ireland and present case studies from a set of four sites, representative of the catchment-stream-lake-estuary continuum, to illustrate new insights that such deployments can provide. These include effects of cattle access on stream turbidity; biogeochemical processing in agricultural streams; effects of summer storms on dissolved organic matter in a catchment and lake; and changes in a trophic index in an estuarine setting. We discuss the additional information provided by such systems when compared to traditional monitoring, some of the challenges related to their use, and assess the future use of HFM to inform management of and policy for aquatic systems on the island of Ireland.					; Regan, Fiona/O-4809-2018; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; hUallachain, Daire/AAN-7384-2021	Mellander, Per-Erik/0000-0002-7261-6758; McCarthy, Valerie/0000-0002-9169-2043; Arnscheidt, Joerg/0000-0002-9744-9917; Linnane, Suzanne/0000-0002-5124-2996; Briciu-Burghina, Ciprian/0000-0001-8682-9116; Jordan, Philip/0000-0002-0893-4591; Wilkes, Robert/0000-0002-2943-9020													0791-7945	2009-003X					2022	122B	3					201	221		10.1353/bae.2022.0014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/bae.2022.0014													WOS:000985382800004

Annual loads (1995-2011) of suspended particulate matter (SPM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were assessed at the Lake Ontario inlet of the St. Lawrence River (SLR) (7110 m(3) s(-1)) and its estuarine outlet at Qu,bec City (12,090 m(3) s(-1)). Internal loads from the Ottawa River (1950 m(3) s(-1)), seventeen other tributaries, urban wastewaters, atmospheric deposition and erosion were also estimated. Erosion (65% of SPM, 29% of TP), inflow from Lake Ontario (42% of DOC, 47% of TN) and Ottawa River (28% of DOC) contributed important flux to the estuary. Loads from other tributaries (20 and 27% of TN and TP at Quebec City) largely exceeded municipal sources (6% of exported TN and TP) and require future remediation. Aquatic plants fixed 277,000 t of C, 49,000 t of N and 7000 t of P (May-Sept.), delaying the nutrient flux to the estuary and turning the SLR into a nutrient sink over summers of lowest discharge. Degradation of exported organic C could consume 5.4-7.1 million t O-2 year(-1) in the estuary whereas SLR flux of N and P represent 31-47% and 7-14% of total annual estuarine flux, respectively. Carbon and Nitrogen flux from freshwaters partly explain the decline in pH and oxygen concentrations in deep estuarine waters thus highlighting the need to reduce diffuse sources of nutrients in the entire watershed.

Issues with supply and demand of advanced fingerling channel catfish necessitate a more proactive approach to Iowa channel catfish management. We performed mark recapture population estimates on 17 channel catfish populations during summer from 2004 to 2008 using tandem set hoop nets baited with soybean cake. We used Pearson correlation analysis to test potential relationships between lake population density and biomass and numerous continuous variables, including channel catfish size distribution indices (proportional size distribution and proportional size distribution -preferred), catch per unit effort (CPUE), relative weight (W), and stocking rate. Channel catfish CPUE was significantly correlated with density. Channel catfish size distribution was negatively correlated with density, and negative density -dependent effects on growth (as indexed by the relative growth index [RGI]) were observed. Both density and CPUE were negatively correlated with RGI. Relative weight throughout the length range of channel catfish populations was positively correlated with RGI. A multiple regression model significantly explained channel catfish density, whereby W-r, of channel catfish less than 508 mm total length and channel catfish stocking rate explained 60% and 17% of the variability, respectively. The ability to anticipate channel catfish density and how it relates to population characteristics such as stocking rate will be a valuable asset to fishery managers.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-25-7				2011	77						545	555																WOS:000393725100045

Microbial precipitation of arsenic, however, has been studied in pure cultures and the isotopic composition of arsenic sulfides associated with some borate deposits suggests a biotic origin for those minerals. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the role of bacterial arsenic precipitation in the biogeochemical cycle of arsenic in such borate deposits. For this purpose both enrichment and pure cultures were obtained from the natural arsenic minerals and the composition and isotopic signatures of the arsenic sulfide minerals precipitated by the cultures and those associated with boron deposits from an Andean salt flat in northern Chile were compared. Based on the microbiological and chemical evidence gathered, it is concluded that bacteria contributed to the formation of the arsenic minerals. This interpretation is based on the consistent association of a variety of features that strongly indicate microbial involvement in the precipitation process. These include: (1) enrichment and isolation of cultures with arsenic precipitation capacity from arsenic mineral samples, (2) high numbers of arsenic-precipitating bacteria in the Andean minerals and brines, ( 3) chemical and mineralogical properties of precipitates experimentally formed under biotic and abiotic conditions, (4) similarities in stoichiometry between natural and laboratory obtained minerals, and (5) the consistent depletion in delta S-34 values for natural versus laboratory obtained sulfides. Thus, microbial precipitation of arsenic sulfides is a geochemically relevant metabolism.

The model uses the maximum-likelihood method with the Akaike information criterion, which provides an objective criterion for model selection. An adequate distribution for describing a single cohort is selected from available probability density functions, which are expressed by location and scale parameters. Daily relative increase rates of the location parameter are expressed by a multivariate logistic function with environmental factors for each day and categorical variables indicating animal ages as independent variables. Daily relative increase rates of the scale parameter are expressed by an equation describing the relationship with the daily relative increase rate of the location parameter. Corbicula japonica grows to a modal shell length of 0.7 mm during the first year in Lake Abashiri. Compared with the attainable maximum size of about 30 mm, the growth of juveniles is extremely slow because their growth is less susceptible to environmental factors until the second winter. The extremely slow growth in Lake Abashiri could be a geographical genetic variation within C. japonica.

Mercury flux was measured using a dynamic flux chamber technique coupled with an automatic mercury vapour-phase analyser (namely, Tekran(R)). The flux chamber shows that the rural grassy site acted primarily as a source of atmospheric mercury, its flux mimicked the solar radiation, with a maximum daytime value of similar to 8.3 ng m(-2) h(-1) of TGM. The water surface location (St. Lawrence River site located about 3 km From the land site) shows deposition and evasion fluxes almost in the same order of magnitude (-0.5 vs 1.0 ng m(-2) h(-1)). The latter is influenced to some extent by solar radiation but primarily by the formation of a layer of stable air over the water surface in which some redox reactions might promote evasion processes over the water surface. This process does not appear over the soil surface. As a whole, soil-air exchange rate is about 6-8 fold greater than the water-air exchange. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study assesses the potential anthropogenic impact on these lakes through sediment analysis. Sediment samples were collected (Spring 2023) in the Aragonese Pyrenees Mountain range and characterized using complementary analytical techniques: LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy, XRD (X-ray diffraction), ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry), and FESEM-EDS (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy with EnergyDispersive X-ray Spectroscopy). These methods were selected for their specific strengths and complementarity in providing elemental, mineralogical, and morphological data. Major elements were identified using LIBS, while quantitative analysis was performed by ICP-MS. XRD and FESEM-EDS were employed for studying the crystalline structure of the samples and individual particles, respectively.

Studies from the adjacent southwest USA have shown major changes in lake levels and vegetation distributions over the late Quaternary which have been interpreted in terms of significant variations in the relative strengths and positions of these climate systems. Palaeoclimatic data from this area have, however, left a number of unresolved questions which can only be answered by extending work into northern Mexico, closer to the major source of summer (monsoonal) rain, the Gulf of Mexico. Studies of palaeolake sediments from a series of hydrologically closed lake basins across a range of altitudes (1280 to 2200 m a.s.l.) in northern Chihuahua are in progress using geochemical, mineral magnetic, diatom and plant microfossil analyses. Preliminary results are presented from the Alta Babicora and Encinillas basins. The sites provide records of lacustrine deposition between >11000 and about 2500 yr BP. The diatom record from Babicora provides clear evidence for a deep water lake in this basin in the late glacial which persisted into the early Holocene. A dry episode coinciding with the timing of the Younger Dryas is recorded in Alta Babicora. Conditions wetter than present are indicated up to at least 7000 yr BP.					; Taylor, David/ISS-5752-2023; Metcalfe, Sarah/H-9484-2013	Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	1997	17	2					155	171		10.1023/A:1007905824147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007905824147													WOS:A1997WP40000001

Introduced yellow perch in two Southeastern US reservoirs: ecological interactions with resident fishes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Roberts CM, DeVries DR, Wright RA. 2018. Introduced yellow perch in two Southeastern US reservoirs: ecological interactions with resident fishes. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:141153.Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) has been introduced into Southeastern US drainages outside its native range; unfortunately, the effects of these introductions at the edge of their distribution on resident fishes have not been well documented. To determine the potential interactions between introduced yellow perch and resident fishes, we quantified diets of multiple life stages over 2 yr in 2 Alabama reservoirs. Temporal and spatial co-occurrence between larval yellow perch and native fishes was limited, and diet overlap was generally low at all life stages. Juvenile yellow perch were consumed by Micropterus spp. in both lakes during spring, suggesting some potential benefit for native piscivores. We suggest minimal negative effects of yellow perch on native fishes in these Southeastern US systems due to their generalist diet, early spawning period, and cool water temperature requirements. In addition, yellow perch may represent an alternative prey resource for piscivores.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2018	34	2					141	153		10.1080/10402381.2017.1402225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.1402225													WOS:000434445700004

A strong westerly wind induced an intense eastward displacement of epilimnetic water and upwelling of hypolimnetic water in the western part of the lake. This led to the formation of an internal front separating cold, hypolimnetic water depleted of chlorophyll in the western part from epilimnetic, warm water with high chlorophyll concentrations in the eastern part. Hydroacoustic detection of zooplankton (by Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) and juvenile fish (by echosounding) revealed both to be passively transported by the wind. Consequently, zooplankton and fish showed comparable horizontal distributions as temperature and chlorophyll. During periods of low wind velocities (< 6 m s(-1)), water temperature was more evenly distributed, whereas phytoplankton distribution was still heterogeneous, probably because of local differences in resource supply. The relative influence of biotic factors for the distribution of organisms increased when external forcing was low. At periods with weak wind forcing, phytoplankton typically showed highest concentrations in the metalimnion, where zooplankton also aggregated in thin layers. In conclusion, we found spatial distributions of temperature and organisms to be strongly controlled by wind forcing when wind velocities were sufficiently high, whereas the importance of internal biotic factors for distribution of organisms increased when wind velocities were less strong. Abiotic factors appeared to act over relatively large spatial scales and affected distributions within the entire ecosystem, whereas biotic factors affected distributions of algae, zooplankton, and fish on a more local scale.

Reflection spectra in spring of 2006 were measured and the simultaneous sampling and analysis were performed. The correlations between chlorophyll a concentration and reflection spectra were studied based on which different chlorophyll a algorithms were established. The results indicate that the accuracy of the linear algorithm using normalized reflectance is not high (R-2 < 0.6). The relationship between chlorophyll a concentration and the reflectance ratios R-708/R-667 can improve accuracy (R-2=0.68). The exponential algorithm between chlorophyll a concentration and the first order differential of the reflectance at 695.5nm is good (R-2=0.76). Multivariate regression models with the normalized reflectance at 708nm and 607nm and their logarithm models were also established and the accuracy is higher than the above, in which the best is the model with the logarithm of 708nm and 607nm(R-2=0.8) The study demonstrates the potential of monitoring chlorophyll a concentration using hyper-spectral remote sensing technology in Dianshan Lake.																			0277-786X		978-0-8194-6512-2				2006	6405						C4050	C4050	64050C	10.1117/12.693534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.693534													WOS:000245645300007

Stream restoration reduces elevated phosphorus levels in an urban watershed	LIMNOLOGICA												Lake Erie is located in North America with its southern shoreline bordering Ohio, as well as parts of Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. A one-year study investigated nutrient pollution in a Central Basin Lake Erie headwater tributary watershed near Cleveland Ohio. Results suggest that the 2019 annual phosphorus load entering Lake Erie from the Euclid Creek watershed was approximately 22,600 pounds, over four times the watershed's target of 5545 pounds. Multiple upstream sites were the major nonpoint sources of nutrient pollution. Four sampling sites averaged phosphorus levels 12-15 times the watershed target of 0.05 mg/L. Leaking sanitary sewers in residential areas were believed to contribute more pollution than the three golf courses and the regional airport located within the watershed. The presence of the Cleveland Metroparks along the riparian corridor in the Main Branch significantly reduced (p < 0.05) nutrients during dry weather. In particular, stream restoration within the Acacia Reservation lowered phosphorus levels by an average 0.31 mg/L. Spring storms contributed the most to the annual phosphorus load (similar to 47 %). To mitigate nutrient pollution in urban watersheds, best management practices (BMPs) would require a two-fold strategy. During dry weather, BMPs should incorporate stream restoration and forested riparian buffers where feasible. Green infrastructure should be designed to mitigate the impact of wet-weather storm-induced flows.

J	Xu, YT; Lai, ZP; Chen, TY; Gong, SL				Xu, Yantian; Lai, Zhongping; Chen, Tianyuan; Gong, Songlin			Late Quaternary optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology and environmental changes in the Hobq Desert, northern China	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Hobq Desert (HD) is distributed along the south bank of the Yellow River in northern China. Proximation to the East Asian summer monsoon limit makes this desert sensitive to fluctuations of monsoonal intensity. However, environmental changes in the HD during late Quaternary are poorly known due to lack of extensive field investigation and appropriate dating materials for radiocarbon dating. In this study, seven field profiles were examined and a chronology framework based on quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) was established to reconstruct environmental changes in the HD. The results suggested two possible periods when lake existed during late Quaternary. The older paleo-lake covering most part of the HD was likely to be formed before similar to 160 ka and vanish at similar to 100 ka, whereas the younger paleo-lake, which was much smaller, existed at similar to 10 ka. The vanishment of the older paleo-lake was probably triggered by a tectonic event, while the existence of the younger paleo-lake was assumed as a response to humid climate in the beginning of Holocene. Meanwhile, the results also showed that modern desert landscape in the HD began at similar to 27 ka, and kept expanding during the Holocene. The climate variations dominated the development of desert landscape in the beginning, and human activity enhanced the desertification at least since similar to 1 ka. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Ust' - Manychskoe, Veselovskoe, Proletarskoe, and Chograiskoe Reservoirs (a Review)	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												The main trends in the development of aquatic communities in reservoirs of the Kuma-Manych depression are considered. The ecosystem of Lake Manych-Gudilo is the most transformed as a result of the extinction of brackish flora and fauna against the background of increasing salinity. The structure of biota became simpler, and productivity decreased. The species diversity of plankton and benthos decreased considerably, and now it is represented by monodominant communities. A sharp reduction in the habitat areas of bottom and plankton organisms occurred. At present they inhabit biotopes with aquatic vegetation in desalinated mouth areas. In summer, destruction processes prevail over the productive, which affects the formation of organic matter and the concentration of nutrients in the water column. At present structural and functional characteristics of the aquatic ecosystem correspond to those before the period of the river regulation. Aquatic communities in the Veselovskoe reservoir and in the part of the Proletarskoe reservoir between dams are relatively stable despite the decrease in the volume of fresh water input, and their fish productivity is high. The restoration of the former productivity and fish resources in the Proletarskoe and Chograiskoe reservoirs is impossible without reconstruction of the soil-reclamation system and maintenance of a fresh water supply in the former volumes.					; Startsev, Alexandre/L-7409-2016; Stepanyan, Oleg/AAQ-2198-2021	Starcev, Aleksandr/0000-0001-5497-102X; 													2079-0961	2079-0988				APR	2014	4	2					91	102		10.1134/S2079096114020103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2079096114020103													WOS:000218907200007

Multivariate Nonstationary Oscillation Simulation of Climate Indices With Empirical Mode Decomposition	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The objective of the current study is to build a stochastic model to simulate climate indices that are teleconnected with the hydrologic regimes of large-scale water resources systems such as the Great Lakes system. Climate indices generally contain nonstationary oscillations (NSOs). We adopted a stochastic simulation model based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The procedure for the model is to decompose the observed series and then to simulate the decomposed components with the NSO resampling (NSOR) technique. Because the model has only been previously applied to single variables, a multivariate version of NSOR (M-NSOR) is developed to consider the links between the climate indices and to reproduce the NSO process. The proposed M-NSOR model is tested in a simulation study on the Rossler system. The simulation results indicate that the M-NSOR model reproduces the significant oscillatory behaviors of the system and the marginal statistical characteristics. Subsequently, the M-NSOR model is applied to three climate indices (i.e., Arctic Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) for the annual and winter data sets. The results of the proposed model are compared to those of the Contemporaneous Shifting Mean and Contemporaneous Autoregressive Moving Average model. The results indicate that the proposed M-NSOR model is superior to the Contemporaneous Shifting Mean and Contemporaneous Autoregressive Moving Average model for reproducing the NSO process, while the other basic statistics are comparatively well preserved in both cases. The current study concludes that the proposed M-NSOR model can be a good alternative to simulate NSO processes and their teleconnections with climate indices.

The sedimentary record reveals strong influence of the large-scale global climate patterns on the local climate in southern part of Eastern Norway. We reconstructed mean July air temperature using Chironomidae-based transfer function and fossil Chironomidae assemblages. The reconstruction was supported by a selection of climate-sensitive geochemical and paleoecological sedimentary proxies of terrestrial and aquatic origin, including Cladocera, pollen and macrofossils. Presented results revealed that summer temperatures were 1-2 degrees C warmer than the mean Millennial temperatures during the 11th, 13th, 15th and 20th centuries and 1-2 degrees C lower during the 12th, 14th, 17th-18th centuries. A persistent cold period, the Little Ice Age (LIA), occurred between 1550 and 1800 CE, was interrupted by a short warming at 1650 CE. The recognized regional climate fluctuations during the last Millennium affected the lake and its catchment, of which the strongest impact was caused by the LIA cooling. During the LIA the catchment vegetation was impacted by climate deterioration and the lake productivity reached its lowest level during the last Millennium. The current temperature reconstruction is in agreement with a previous continental scale temperature reconstruction for Europe. From obtained results it emerges that during the LIA the climate of western Scandinavia has been dictated by the atmospheric patterns originating from the North Atlantic. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Dissipation and mixing during the onset of stratification in a temperate lake, Windermere	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers and chains of temperature sensors were used to observe the spring transition to stable stratification over a 55-d period in a temperate lake. Observations of the flow structure were complemented by measurements of dissipation, based on the structure function method, near the lake bed and in the upper part of the water column. During complete vertical mixing, wind-driven motions had horizontally isotropic velocities with roughly equal barotropic and baroclinic kinetic energy. Dissipation was closely correlated with the wind-speed cubed, indicating law of the wall scaling, and had peak values of similar to 1 x 10(-5.5) W kg(-1) at ten meters depth during maximum wind forcing (W similar to 15 m s(-1)). As stratification developed, the flow evolved into a predominantly baroclinic regime dominated by the first mode internal seiche, with root mean square axial flow speeds of similar to 2-3 cm(-1); similar to 2.5-times the transverse component. At 2.8 m above the bed, most of the dissipation occurred in a number of strong maxima coinciding with peaks of near-bed flow. In the pycnocline, dissipation was low most of the time, but with pronounced maxima (reaching similar to 1 x 10(-5) W kg(-1)) closely related to the local velocity shear. The downward diffusive heat flux across the pycnocline over 27.5 d accounted for similar to 70% of the temperature rise in the water column below. Total lake kinetic energy increased by a factor of three between mixed and stratified regimes, in spite of reduced wind forcing, indicating less efficient damping in stable conditions.

A multi-proxy lacustrine record of Holocene climate change on northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Reconstructions of past environmental changes are critical for understanding the natural variability of Earth's climate system and for providing a context for present and future global change. Radiocarbon-dated lake sediments from Lake CF3, northeastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, are used to reconstruct past environmental conditions over the last 11,200 years. Numerous proxies, including chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, diatom-inferred lakewater pH, and sediment organic matter, reveal a pronounced Holocene thermal maximum as much as 5 degrees C warmer than historic summer temperatures from similar to 10,000 to 8500 cal yr B.P. Following rapid cooling similar to 8500 cal yr B.P., Lake CF3 proxies indicate cooling through the late Holocene. At many sites in northeastern Canada, the Holocene thermal maximum occurred later than at Lake CF3; this late onset of Holocene warmth is generally attributed to the impacts of the decaying Laurentide Ice Sheet on early Holocene temperatures in northeastern Canada. However, the lacustrine proxies in Lake CF3 apparently responded to insolation-driven warnith, despite the proximity of Lake CF3 to the Laurentide Ice Sheet and its meltwater. The magnitude and timing of the Holocene thermal maximum at Lake CF3 indicate that temperatures and environmental conditions at this site are highly sensitive to changes in radiative forcing.

Inferring causal impacts of extreme water-level drawdowns on lake water clarity using long-term monitoring data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although long-term ecosystem monitoring provides essential knowledge for practicing ecosystem management, analyses of the causal effects of ecological impacts from large-scale observational data are still in an early stage of development. We used causal impact analysis (CIA)-a synthetic control method that enables estimation of causal impacts from unrepeated, long-term observational data-to evaluate the causal impacts of extreme water-level drawdowns during summer on subsequent water quality. We used more than 100 years of transparency and water level monitoring data from Lake Biwa, Japan. The results of the CIA showed that the most extreme drawdown in recorded history, which occurred in 1994, had a significant positive effect on transparency (a maximum increase of 1.75 m on average over the following year) in the north basin of the lake. The extreme drawdown in 1939 was also shown to be a trigger for an increase in transparency in the north basin, whereas that in 1984 had no significant effects on transparency. In the south basin, contrary to the pattern in the north basin, the extreme drawdown had a significant negative effect on transparency shortly after the extreme drawdown. These different impacts of the extreme drawdowns were considered to be affected by the timing and magnitude of the extreme drawdowns and the depths of the basins. Our approach of inferring the causal impacts of past events on ecosystems will be helpful in implementing water-level management for ecosystem management and improving water quality in lakes.

Cheonji is covered with snow and ice for about six months of the year due to its high altitude and its surrounding environment. Since most of the sources of water are from groundwater, the water temperature is closely related to the volcanic activity. However, in the 2000s, many volcanic activities have been monitored on the mountain. In this study, we analyzed the dimension of ice produced during winter in Baekdu Mountain using Sentinel-1 satellite image data provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). In order to calculate the dimension of ice from the backscatter image of the Sentinel-1 satellite, 20 Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) layers were generated from two polarization images using texture analysis. The method used in calculating the area was utilized with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the GLCM layer which is to calculate the dimension of ice in the image. Also, the calculated area was correlated with temperature data obtained from Samjiyeon weather station. This study could be used as a basis for suggesting an alternative to the new method of calculating the area of ice before using a long-term time series analysis on a full scale.

In Lake Tjeukemeer, microcystins were present throughout summer (maximum concentration 30 mu g l(-1)) while cyanobacterial diversity was low and very constant. The dominant phototroph was Planktothrix agardhii. In contrast, Lake Klinckenberg showed a high microcystin peak (up to 140 mu g l(-1)) of short duration. In this lake, cyanobacterial diversity was higher and very dynamic with apparent genotype successions. Several genotypes derived from DGGE field profiles matched with genotypes from cultures isolated from field samples. The microcystin peak measured in Lake Klinckenberg could be confidently linked to a bloom of Planktothrix rubescens, as microscopic and genotypic analysis showed identity of bloom samples and a toxin-producing P. rubescens culture. Toxin-producing genotypes were detected in the microbial community before they reached densities at which they were detected by using microscopy. Cyanobacterial biovolumes provided additional insights in bloom dynamics. In both lakes, the microcystin content per cell was highest at the onset of the blooms. Our results suggest that while genotypic characterization of a lake can be valuable for detection of toxic organisms, for some lakes a monitoring of algal biomass has sufficient predictive value for an assessment of toxin production.

J	Veldre, I; Karlova, S				Veldre, I; Karlova, S			Precursors of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds in Lake Peipsi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The concentration of precursors of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds, nitrates and nitrites as well as ammonia, in the surface water of Lake Peipsi and its tributaries has been determined during the period 1985-1988. The nitrate and nitrite content was also analysed in bottom sediments and fish from the lake. The nitrate concentration in the water of Lake Peipsi varied from 0.01 to 2.33 mg NO3-N 1(-1), the average value from 0.27 to 1.60 mg NO3-N 1(-1), with the lowest concentrations in summer. The variations may be caused by different pollution loads, meteorological conditions, and assimilation of nitrates by plants and algae. The nitrate content in the water of rivers was on an average somewhat higher in comparison with its concentrations in the lake. The concentrations of nitrites were, as a rule, about an order of magnitude lower than those of nitrates. The amount of ammonia varied from 0.15 to 0.36 mg NH4-N 1(-1). At present the concentrations of the studied nitrogen compounds are not essential and do not prevent from using the lake for recreation and drinking water supply.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1996	338	1-3					191	198		10.1007/BF00031724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031724													WOS:A1996WC58000020

In the surface layer of bottom sediments (0-1 cm), where large PPP blooms occurred in the past 5 years, >10(5) cells cm(-3) of PPP were found to be viable throughout the year. Furthermore, the density of PPP deposited on the sediment surface (0-0.1 cm) was one order of magnitude higher (MPN = 1.3 x 10(6) cells cm(-3), direct count = 9.9 x 10(6) cells cm(-3)) than that of bulked surface sediments (0-1 cm). Even in the deeper layer (13-14 cm) of bottom mud, viable PPP were still found (10(1) cells cm(-3)). In winter, viable PPP in the aphotic bottom sediments were 10(4)-10(5) times greater per unit volume than those in the euphotic lake water. Since the aphotic bottom sediments have high levels of PPP, as well as high growth potential (high ratio of viable count/total direct count), they are likely to seed PPP blooms in the North Basin of Lake Biwa.																			0142-7873					APR	1996	18	4					539	550		10.1093/plankt/18.4.539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.4.539													WOS:A1996UF93600006

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of WRF model for simulating temperature and rainfall over Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia. The WRF model was configured for six experimental setups using three land surface models (LSMs): Noah, RUC and TD; and two land use datasets: USGS and updated New Land Use (NLU). The performances of WRF configurations were assessed by comparing simulated and observed data from March to August 2015. The result showed that temperature and rainfall simulations were sensitive to LSM and land use data choice. The combination of NLU with RUC and TD produced very small cold bias (0.27 degrees C) and warm bias (0.20 degrees C) for 2m maximum temperature (Tmax) and 2m minimum temperature (Tmin), respectively. WRF model with RUC and NLU captured well the observed spatial and temporal variability of Tmax, while TD and NLU for Tmin. Moreover, rainfall simulation was better with NLU; especially NLU and Noah configuration produced the smallest mean bias (2.39 mm/day) and root mean square error (6.6 mm/day). All the WRF experiments overestimated light and heavy rainfall events. Overall, findings showed that the application of updated land use data substantially improved the WRF model performance in simulating temperature and rainfall. The study would provide valuable support for identifying suitable LSM and land use data that can accurately predict the climate variables in the Blue Nile basin.

Summer food habits and prey taxa and size electivity of age-0 white bass in a South-Central Nebraska irrigation reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Understanding consumption patterns and preferences of particular life stages for fish species can clarify potential dietary overlap and identify energy flow within aquatic communities. Age-0 white bass (Morone chrysops) have been documented to consume a variety of prey items and zooplankton are a common occurrence. The importance of particular zooplankton taxa and available sizes will likely impact prey selectivity, which is not understood for age-0 white bass. The objectives of this study were to evaluate food habits, prey electivity, and size selectivity of age-0 white bass in an irrigation reservoir from July to September 2015 and 2016. By number, age-0 white bass consumed mostly zooplankton from July to September. Consumption of fish become an important component of the diet for 22% of fish starting at 80 mm TL. Calanoida were the primary zooplankton taxa consumed and selected for by age-0 white bass. In relation to other zooplankton taxa, Calanoida were one of the most abundant taxa groups available and age-0 white bass displayed size selective feeding by consuming the larger Calanoida available in the environment. While Calanoida are not the largest taxa available, their high density appears to result in higher consumption by age-0 white bass compared to other available taxa.

Modelling leaf wax n-alkane inputs to soils along a latitudinal transect across Australia	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Leaf wax n-alkanes provide a valuable palaeoecological proxy, but their interpretation requires an understanding of the scale of temporal and spatial integration in soils. Leaf wax n-alkanes are continually deposited into soils directly from local plants as well as from more distant plants via wind or water transport. In addition, n-alkanes can persist in soils for thousands of years, and tend to decrease in age with shallower depth. To explore whether the uppermost soils reflect recent leaf fall inputs we compared surface soils and modern vegetation from 20 sites along a transect across Australia. At each site, the three most dominant plant species and a soil sample from the top 3 cm were analysed for n-alkane concentration, average chain length (ACL), proportional abundance of C-33 and C-29 (Norm33) and carbon preference index (CPI). Chain length distributions differ between trees and grasses, with a higher proportion of C-29 in trees and C-33 in grasses. Norm33 in soils correlates with proportional grass to tree cover across the transect. To model n-alkane inputs for each site, we calculated a predicted ACL, Norm33 and CPI using the dominant plants at that site, weighted by proportional species cover and n-alkane concentration. Predicted ACL, Norm33 and CPI inputs were generally higher than the soils, demonstrating that recent and local inputs do not dominate soil n-alkanes at our study sites. Thus, n-alkane distributions in surface soils do not correlate with local, current vegetation, but do correlate with proportional grass and tree cover, suggesting they provide a faithful record of large scale ecosystem structure.

J	Villiers, G; Kleinhans, MG; Postma, G				de Villiers, Germari; Kleinhans, Maarten G.; Postma, George			Experimental delta formation in crater lakes and implications for interpretation of Martian deltas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												The morphology of delta deposits in crater lakes on Mars is indicative of upstream (e.g., flow discharge and sediment properties) and downstream (e.g., basin characteristics) parameters, from which the hydrological conditions at the time of formation can be inferred. To investigate the influences of these parameters on delta morphology, we experimentally created deltas in crater-shaped basins by feeding a range of constant flow discharges over a feeder channel of various sand textures. We reproduced three categorically different types of deltas including most of the types that have been identified on Mars. Our most striking observation is that water level behavior (itself a unique function of flow discharge, basin size and hypsometry, and basin floor permeability) can explain most delta morphologies observed on Mars. Stepped, retrograding deltas formed during water level rise, prograding deltas formed during water level still stand, and during water level fall deltas were partially destroyed by erosion. On Mars numerous retrograding and prograding deltas were preserved, most of them without indications of channel incisions or other fluvial modification. We conclude that the main difference between a single-foreset prograding delta and a multiple-foreset retrograding delta is the behavior of the water level in the basin. These simple delta morphologies cannot be reconciled with long-duration hydrological activity, because that would imply crater lake fluctuations due to inherent complex water level histories along with complex sediment delivery histories. Our experiments and numerical verifications demonstrate that such deltas preferentially form during one aqueous event, which parsimoniously argues for short-duration hydrological activity.

Biotic and abiotic determinants of finescale dace distribution at the southern edge of their range	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim The factors that set range limits for animal populations can inform management plans aimed at maintaining regional biodiversity. We examine abiotic and biotic drivers of the distribution of finescale dace (Chrosomus neogaeus) in two Great Plains basins to identify limiting factors for a threatened freshwater fish population at the edge of their range. Location Great Plains, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. Methods We investigated abiotic and biotic factors influencing the contemporary distribution of finescale dace in the Belle Fourche and Niobrara River basins with Random Forests classification models using fish surveys from multiple agencies spanning 2008-2019 and GIS-derived environmental data. Results In both basins, finescale dace occurrence exhibited a nonlinear response to mean August water temperature. Abiotic covariates, including streamflow, water temperature and channel slope, were important limiting factors in the final model fit with Belle Fourche River basin surveys (n = 131). In contrast, a biotic covariate, native minnow richness, was the most important predictor of finescale dace occurrence in the Niobrara River basin model (n = 27). In the Niobrara River, native minnow richness was lower at sites with non-native northern pike (Esox lucius). Main conclusions Basin-specific analyses revealed context dependencies for species-environment relationships, which can inform targeted restoration actions. Similar relationships between water temperature and finescale dace occurrence across both basins suggest summer thermal habitat as a regional limiting factor. The importance of biotic interactions in the Niobrara River highlights an emergent threat from invasive predators to a distinct assemblage of native prairie fishes.

Landscape changes in the Tombstone Territorial Park region (central Yukon, Canada) from multilevel remote sensing analysis	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Northern ecosystems are vulnerable to surface disturbances caused by warming climate and human activities. The Ogilvie Mountains in central Yukon are an important region that should be monitored, as it is a major transportation corridor con-necting northern communities. This study aims to characterize 35 years of landscape changes in the Tombstone Territorial Park and the surrounding region of the Ogilvie Mountains by detecting and interpreting landscape changes using a Landsat-derived trend analysis and multilevel image interpretation. Statistically significant spectral changes occurred in 24% of the study area between 1986 and 2021, and most of these changes are gradual and associated with vegetation succession and hy-drological processes (i.e., erosion and deposition). Other landscape changes included wildfires, slumps, changes to riverbanks and lake shores, earlier melting of icings in the summer, degradation on the peripheries of some ice-wedge polygonal terrain, and potential insect damage to forests. Our investigation reveals that the extent and magnitude of landscape changes in the study area are influenced by climate, geomorphic setting, ecological succession, and glacial history of the region. Given a var-ied combination of ecotypes, spatial and temporal variations are to be expected in terms of the response of the landscape to climate and anthropogenic disturbances.

To understand the ecological trajectory of lakes used as freshwater supply, we conducted a paleolimnological assessment on two supplemental sources in Igloolik, Nunavut, Arctic Canada. A stratigraphic examination of biological indicators (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) allowed for paleotemperature reconstructions with decadal and centennial resolution over the past 2000 years. Between 200 and 1900 CE, the sub-fossil chironomid community was comprised of cold-water taxa, such as Abiskomyia, Micropsectra radialis-type, and Paracladius. Reconstructed temperatures were consistent with known climate anomalies during this period. A rapid shift in the composition of the chironomid assemblages to those with higher temperature optima (Chironomus anthracinus-type, Dicrotendipes, and Tanytarsus lugens-type) in the late 20th century was observed in both systems. Our results demonstrate that these ecosystems are undergoing marked transformations to warmer, more nutrient-rich environments, and suggest that water sustainability pressures will likely continue in tandem with ongoing climate change. To contextualize the influence of recent warming and elucidate the status of freshwater resources over the longer term, paleolimnological methods can be usefully applied as components of vulnerability assessments.					; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019	Wesche, Sonia/0000-0002-8300-954X; Cincio, Paige/0000-0003-1722-0563													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2021	31	7					1175	1185	09596836211003234	10.1177/09596836211003234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211003234		MAR 2021											WOS:000638762000001

It has a complex multiphase history. The recognized speleogenetic phases are related to spring level and to old valley floors. The six most recent phases were investigated in St. Beatus cave and Barenschacht. They suggest a progressive Quarternary Aare valley incision to 890, 805, 760, 700, 660, and 558 in a.s.l. that is confirmed by statistical analysis of small caves. U/Th-datings of flowstone allowed a timing of the valley deepening phases: the valley bottom was at 760 in already before 350 ka, the one at 700 in was active between 235 and 160 ka. The cave morphology in the upper part of the cave system was coupled with sedimentological observations. This combination leads to the hypothesis that the uppermost (oldest) cave parts were already created in the Miocene, during and after the last deposition of the Molasse. Ideas about the evolution of the paleorelief suggest that today's Aare valley is a product of glacial erosion, and that the old Aare valley shifted its position several times between the Miocene and today.

Sedimentary and geomorphic evidence of Saharan megalakes: A synthesis	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												It has long been recognised that the Sahara Desert contains sediment, landform and palaeoecological evidence for phases of increased humidity during the Quaternary period. Many authors have also suggested that during some of these humid periods very large lakes, termed megalakes, developed in several basins within the Sahara. Recent work has questioned their existence. In particular it has been argued that the lack of well-developed and spatially extensive shorelines in these basins suggests that discrete groundwater and spring deposits have been misinterpreted as evidence for megalakes. In this paper we re-evaluate the evidence used to identify megalakes. Firstly, we apply a comprehensive remote sensing and GIS analyses to the megalake shorelines, their catchments and the wider Sahara. This not only supports the previously proposed existence of numerous megalakes, but also indicates a previously unrecognised megalake in the Niger Inland Delta region, here named Megalake Timbuktu. Secondly, we review the geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the megalakes, highlighting the importance of the sedimentary record in identifying lake highstands, particularly through the example of the Chotts Megalake in southern Tunisia where we provide new sedimentary information on lake shorelines. This analysis demonstrates that in much of the Sahara the dynamic aeolian systems preclude the preservation of well-developed shorelines, but the distribution of fragmented geomorphic features and localised lake deposits provide robust evidence for Quaternary megalake formation. The paper concludes by highlighting that although extensive evidence for Saharan megalake formation exists, the current chronology of lake highstands indicates that the vast majority date to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 or earlier. Only megalakes Chad and Timbuktu, which derive much of their water from outside the desert, show evidence for Holocene (African Humid Period or AHP) shorelines. The AHP record of the other megalakes indicate the existence of much smaller water bodies than those that developed earlier in the Pleistocene indicating that it was significantly drier than these earlier humid phases.

J	Anderson, MR; Neumann, RM				Anderson, MR; Neumann, RM			Factors influencing growth and body condition of alewives in Connecticut lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Alewives were collected by nighttime gill netting during summer 1999 from 12 Connecticut lakes that support landlocked populations to determine relationships between population characteristics and physicochemical lake variables. Mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) ranged from 0.2 to 16.4 age-1 and older alewives per net hour. Maximum ages of alewives among lakes ranged from two to five years, and mean back-calculated length-at-age-1, used to index growth rate, ranged from 78 to 146 mm. Mean back-calculated length-at-age-1 was positively correlated with mean relative condition factor (K-n), watershed area:lake surface area ratio, watershed area:lake volume ratio, lake surface area:lake volume ratio, conductivity, total nitrogen, alkalinity, calcium, magnesium, and chlorophyll a, and negatively correlated with retention time, maximum lake depth, mean lake depth, and transparency. Mean K-n ranged from 0.93 to 1.23 and was positively correlated with mean back-calculated length-at-age-1, watershed area:lake volume ratio, lake surface area:lake volume ratio, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and potassium, and negatively correlated with maximum lake depth and transparency. Growth and K-n of alewives were highest in shallow, productive lakes with low transparencies. CPUE was not related to growth rate or to any physicochemical lake variable.

The replacement of saltmarshes by mangroves is expected due to global warming, reflecting the long-term natural trends in the Holocene and anthropogenic impacts since the 20th century. We documented the Holocene history of wetlands dynamics in the boreal limits of the American mangroves, located at Bay Champagne, Louisiana (USA), by integrating sedimentological, palynological, geochemical (delta C-13 and C\N), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data, and radiocarbon chronology from two sediment cores. The results indicated a freshwater lake environment with herbs and wetland ferns, aswell as C-3 terrestrial plants, between similar to 8100 and similar to 6500 cal yr BP. This environment shifted into a lagoon and saltmarshes having sedimentary organic matter sourced frommarine algae between similar to 6500 and similar to 1500 cal yr BP. In the final stage, washover sediments were deposited in the lagoon during the last similar to 1500 cal yr BP. Despite the increased marine influence over the last similar to 6500 cal yr BP, mangrove pollenwere not recorded between similar to 8100 and similar to 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting that mangroves were absent in the study area during that time interval. Historical evidence and a comparative analysis of ourmulti-proxy datawith othermangrove studies fromthe Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and eastern South America revealed a gradualmangrove expansion from tropical to subtropical coasts of South and North America during the mid-late Holocene. The mangrove colonies at their current boreal (29 degrees 09' N) and austral (28 degrees 29' S) limits were established in the early and mid-20th century, respectively. This mangrove dynamics on a continental scale suggests that the polewardmangrove migrationwas likely caused by the warming climate during the Holocene.

A modeling approach for assessing the effect of multiple alpine lakes in sequence on nutrient transport	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of a single lake on downstream water chemistry may be compounded by the presence of additional lakes within the watershed, augmenting or negating the effects of the first lake. Multiple, linked lakes are a common feature of many watersheds and these resemble reactors in series often studied in engineering. The effects of multiple lakes in series on nutrient transport are largely unexplored. We populated and calibrated a simple lake model to investigate the role of a sub-alpine lake (Bull Trout Lake (BTL), Rocky Mountains, USA) on the transport of the macronutrients during the summer of 2008. Further, we developed a sequential model in which four identical lakes (copies of the BTL model) were connected in series. All lakes in the sequence retarded the flux of nutrients, thus slowing their transport downstream. The first lake in the sequence dramatically altered stream water chemistry and served as a sink for C and P and a source of N, while additional lakes downstream became sources of C, N and P. Although additional downstream lakes resulted in important changes to water chemistry and nutrient transport, the nature of the changes were similar from Lakes 2 to 4 and the magnitude of the changes diminished with distance downstream. Our lake model served as an effective tool for assessing the nutrient budget of the lake and the hypothetical effect of multiple lakes in sequence in a landscape limnology framework.

Here we examined bacterial community structure using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and evaluated the potential role of viruses in influencing them in two productive freshwater reservoirs namely, Villerest and Grangent (Central France). Two dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses indicated that bacterial communities in both reservoirs were structurally different in time and space, with Villerest harboring more diverse communities than Grangent reservoir. The bacterial communities in both reservoirs were dominated by hgcI clade (Actinobacteria) and Limnohabitans (Betaproteobacteria) which are known to have adaptive life strategies towards top-down mechanisms and resource utilization. In Villerest, thermal stratification of water column which resulted in temporary anoxia especially during summer promoted the occurrence of anoxygenic phototrophic and methanotrophic bacteria. Overall, low bacterial richness which was linked to viral lytic infection possibly suggests that a relatively small number of highly active bacterial populations sustained high bacterial activity and viral abundances. Weighted UniFrac analysis indicated that a minimum threshold viral infection and virus-to-bacteria ratio (serve as a proxy) of 10% and 10, respectively, is required to exert its impact on phylogenetic structure of bacterial community. Therefore depending on the levels of viral infection we suggest that viruses at times can prevail over other trophic or top-down factors in shaping and structuring bacterial communities in such man-made artificial freshwater systems.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Keshri, Jitendra/K-5529-2012	Angia Sriram, Pradeep Ram/0000-0002-5469-0452; Keshri, Jitendra/0000-0002-8902-1582													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2019	81	4							72	10.1007/s00027-019-0669-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0669-5													WOS:000485245400001

Factors that influence productivity and vulnerability of Inconnu, Stenodus leucichthys nelma, populations in Canada	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY					12th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes (ISBMCF)	2014	RUSSIA					In northwestern Canada, Inconnu, Stenodus leucichthys nelma, is at the far eastern part of its partially circumpolar range. Within the Mackenzie River system of Canada there are a number of distinct populations of Inconnu. There is strong evidence for distinctive life history type based on genetics and migratory patterns, however, the factors controlling the population dynamics of Inconnu remain unclear. There is evidence that vulnerability of Inconnu populations is a function of the life history type, habitat quality and fisheries. Inconnu have not done well where there are commercial fisheries such as in Great Slave Lake but support a substantial subsistence harvest at tributaries of the lower Mackenzie River, such as the Arctic Red River and the Peel River. On the other hand Inconnu population fluctuations in the Yellowknife River have occurred independently of fishing pressure, and may instead be connected to habitat degradation and recovery. These findings are similar to parallel studies in Eurasia that show Inconnu populations have declined or become extirpated through habitat losses from hydro-electric dams and fishing. We note there are substantial differences in age and size structure of different life history types which likely influence productivity and vulnerability. Much of the biology such as juvenile life history, ontogenetic shifts in diet, reproductive requirements and over-wintering ecology of this species remains poorly understood.																			1863-9135					FEB	2017	189	3					235	247		10.1127/fal/2016/0815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0815													WOS:000397045900006
J	Tokano, T				Tokano, T			Meteorological assessment of the surface temperatures on Titan: constraints on the surface type	ICARUS					Symposium on Solar System Remote Sensing	SEP 20-22, 2002	Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA	NASA, Planetary Geol & Geophys Program, Lunar & Planetary Inst	Univ Pittsburgh			The latitudinal profile of near-surface air temperature on Titan retrieved by Voyager 1 has been difficult to understand and raised several speculations about possible exotic processes that might be occurring near Titan's surface, while the thermal properties of the surface itself are unknown. This study systematically investigates the seasonal and spatial variation of the surface temperature and air temperature in the lower troposphere by a 3-dimensional general circulation model for different putative surface types (porous icy regolith, rock-ice mixture, hydrocarbon lakes). For any viable surface type the surface temperature is unlikely to be constant through the year and should more or less vary seasonally and even diurnally, most likely by a few K. Recent observations of tropospheric clouds may be evidence of seasonal variation of the surface temperature and the model predicts in the case of solid surface the development of a convective layer with superadiabatic lapse rates near the surface exactly at those latitudes and seasons where clouds have been identified. The latitudinal profile of the surface temperature retrieved from Voyager 1 infrared spectra can be explained without invoking exotic effects, provided the thermal inertia of the surface is relatively small and/or the surface albedo is low. A dominance of water ice (high thermal inertia and high albedo) at the surface is unfavorable to reproduce the observation. The latitudinal gradient of the surface temperature is particularly large at the hydrocarbon lake surface due to low albedo and small surface drag. Local anomalies of the surface albedo or surface thermal inertia are likely to cause substantial inhomogeneities of the surface temperature. Quasi-permanent accumulation of stratospheric haze at both poles would create a perennial equator-to-pole contrast of the surface temperature, but also a substantially lower global-mean surface temperature due to an enhanced anti-greenhouse effect in summer. The air temperature in the lower troposphere exhibits a tiny latitudinal gradient and a pole-to-pole gradient due to the presence of a pole-to-pole Hadley circulation, indicating that the temperature within the planetary boundary layer may exhibit a vertical profile characteristic of season, location and scenario. There may be a shallow near-surface inversion layer in cold seasons and a shallow convective layer in warm seasons. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Diggins, TP; Snyder, RJ				Diggins, TP; Snyder, RJ			Three decades of change in the benthic macroinvertebrate community and water quality in the Buffalo River Area of Concern, 1964-1993	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We present a historical review of 18 independent benthic macroinvertebrate and water quality studies of the Buffalo River, New York, Area of Concern (AOC), revealing dramatic changes between 1964 and 1993. Many results were taken from unpublished literature that is not widely obtainable. We focused on three biological metrics (invertebrate family richness, oligochaete abundance, chironomid abundance) and three water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen [DO], total suspended solids [TSS], summer temperature) consistently reported by the studies we reviewed. Most of the AOC was devoid of macroinvertebrates in 1964, but recolonization and community expansion occurred during the following decades. As many as nine families were encountered at river sites in 1990-1993 while typically no more than two could be collected before 1972. Trends suggest chironomid abundance and generic richness also increased over the study period. Water quality has improved since 1964, most notably in terms of increased DO (from near 0 to generally > 5.0 mg/L) and decreased low-flow TSS (from >100 to < 10 mg/L). These environmental improvements are encouraging, but continued dominance of the Buffalo River AOC by pollution tolerant tubificid oligochaetes and chironomids suggests further rehabilitation is needed.																			0380-1330						2003	29	4					652	663		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70468-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70468-7													WOS:000187946400012

An assessment of the size structure, distribution and behaviour of fish populations within a temporarily closed estuary using dual frequency identification sonar (DIDSON)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The fish populations within the East Kleinemonde Estuary, South Africa, were studied using Dual frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON) during March 2010 which allowed for direct comparisons of the abundance, distribution and behaviour of a wide size range of fishes along the length of the system. Small schooling fishes <100 mm in total length (L(T)) were most abundant while larger size classes 100-300 and 300-500 mm were less abundant, but evenly distributed longitudinally within the estuary. Fishes <100 mm were most abundant within the mouth region which may reflect the feeding ecology of species that fall into these size classes and the effects of higher turbidities further up the estuary. Large fishes >500 mm were similarly most abundant near the mouth, and fishes of this size being mostly piscivorous, probably showed these distribution patterns due to the location of smaller prey fishes. Differential behaviour was observed among the longitudinal sections, with small fishes forming schools in areas of low turbidity and particularly in the presence of large predatory fishes. Results from this study present a snap-shot of the composition, distribution and behaviour of the ichthyofauna within a small temporarily closed estuary, and also show that abiotic factors and interactions of various size classes can influence their distribution. There is significant potential for DIDSON in future ecological research within these systems.

J	Doner, L				Doner, L			Late-Holocene paleoenvironments of northwest Iceland from lake sediments	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Frozen sediment cores from two lakes in northwest Iceland, Vatnsdalsvatn and Thioriksvallavatn, provide a nearly 1000-year, decadal-scale record of past environmental changes, based on environmental magnetism, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy geochemistry, carbon content, and C/N analyses. Accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 and Pb-210 results provide chronologies for both sites, covering the late 20th century to 960 BP at Vatnsdalsvatn and to 480 BP at Thioriksvallavatn. These analyses reveal higher levels of sedimentary carbon during the Little lee Age, between 600 and 50 BP, at Vatnsdalsvatn. C/N analyses suggest that some of this carbon enrichment came from terrestrial plants. Higher erosion rates during the Little Ice Age may also have increased the influx of limiting nutrients, enhancing algal productivity. Erosion is the dominant mechanism for sedimentary changes at both sites and seems to occur at predictable intervals. Geochemical indicators of erosion oscillate with a distinct 80-100 yr periodicity for nine centuries at Vatnsdalsvatn and for four centuries at Thioriksvallavatn. These erosion cycles are consistent with long-term stability in the positive mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation but may also be attributed to local climatic effects associated with Great Salinity Anomalies.

Most of this research has been devoted to marine ecosystems, whereas scant research has been conducted on fresh water bodies. Lake Baikal (Russia) is a unique natural reservoir. Previous studies devoted to the amount of microplastics in the waters of Lake Baikal were carried out singularly and were not of a systemic character; therefore, previously obtained data does not reflect a complete picture of the state of the lake. Within the framework of this study, our goal was to study the composition and morphological structure of microplastic particles in the ice of Lake Baikal at different distances from the coastline. To do this, a number of ice samples were taken from the upper and lower sides at five different points in South Baikal opposite the village of Bolshiye Koty. Later these samples were analyzed for the types of microplastics and their amount. In the samples taken, two types of microplastics were found-fragments and fibers-with fibers being predominant. The median values of the number of microplastics particles are higher in samples taken at the interface between water and ice, compared to samples taken from the ice surface. Presumably, main part of microplastic fibers found opposite the village of Bolshiye Koty were brought in by a constant circular current from the opposite east coast. In turn, the low number of fragments in the samples may be due to the freezing of the coastline.					; Ermolaeva, Yana/KOD-7550-2024; Karnaukhov, Dmitry/U-3560-2019; Silow, Eugene/C-2958-2011	Maslennikova, Maria/0000-0002-2331-6310; Pushnica, Viktoria/0000-0002-7225-3889; Ermolaeva, Yana/0000-0003-3658-4821; Silow, Eugene/0000-0002-7039-3220													2383-451X	2383-4501					2022	8	2					435	446		10.22059/POLL.2021.328762.1159	http://dx.doi.org/10.22059/POLL.2021.328762.1159													WOS:000759076700005

Semi-quantitative samples from five sites, each in a 1.5 km stretch of Mountain Stream, Pine River, Salmon-Trout River and Huron River, were the basis for structural and functional comparisons between streams. Ancillary water chemistry data reflect the relative pollution free nature of these streams. Both water chemistry and macroinvertebrate data served as the first baseline data for Huron Mountain streams. No new or rare species were found among the 194 species sampled. Temporal differences in taxonomic makeup within streams were due to differences among insect species life cycles. Taxonomic makeup between streams was generally similar, but certain differences are shown to be possibly related to factors such as lake sources, interspecific interactions, and stream size. Based on relative abundance of each functional feeding group, assemblages in all streams were functionally similar and collector-dominated. ANOVA results indicated significant differences in functional feeding group abundance and biomass between streams in every case. The functional variations reflected by specific differences in taxonomic composition between stream assemblages are discussed.					; Kaspari, Michael/H-8157-2019	Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413; 													0018-8158					SEP 13	1996	330	3					195	211		10.1007/BF00024208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024208													WOS:A1996VP18400004
J	Trench-Fiol, S; Fink, P				Trench-Fiol, Stephanie; Fink, Patrick			Metatranscriptomics From a Small Aquatic System: Microeukaryotic Community Functions Through the Diurnal Cycle	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Light is an important factor for the growth of planktonic organisms, and many of them depend on the diurnal light/dark cycle to regulate key metabolic processes. So far, most of the diel responses were only studied in single species or marine and large lake communities. Yet, we lack information on whether these processes are regulated similarly in small aquatic systems such as ponds. Here, we investigated the activity of a microeukaryotic community from a temperate, small freshwater pond in response to the diurnal cycle. For this, we took samples at midday and night during the Central European summer. We extracted pigments and RNA from samples and the sequencing of eukaryotic transcripts allowed us to obtain day and night metatranscriptomes. Differentially expressed transcripts primarily corresponded to photosynthesis-related and translational processes, and were found to be upregulated at midday with high light conditions compared to darkness. Unique gene ontology classes were found at each respective condition. During the day, ontology classes including photoreception for photosynthesis, defense, and stress mechanisms dominated, while motility, ribosomal assembly and other large, energy-consuming processes were restricted to the night. Euglenophyta and Chlorophyta dominated the active phototrophic community, as shown by the pigment composition analysis. Regarding the gene expression patterns, we could confirm that the pond community appears to follow similar diurnal dynamics as those described for larger aquatic ecosystems. Overall, combining pigment analyses, metatranscriptomics, and data on physicochemical factors yielded considerably more insight into the metabolic processes performed by the microeukaryotic community of a small freshwater ecosystem.					; Fink, Patrick/A-5901-2009	Trench Fiol, Stephanie/0000-0003-1057-5732; Fink, Patrick/0000-0002-5927-8977														1664-302X				MAY 25	2020	11								1006	10.3389/fmicb.2020.01006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01006								32523568					WOS:000540566500001
J	LIVERMAN, DGE				LIVERMAN, DGE			SEDIMENTOLOGY AND HISTORY OF A LATE WISCONSINAN GLACIAL LAKE, GRANDE-PRAIRIE, ALBERTA, CANADA	BOREAS												The Grande Prairie region of northwestern Alberta was partially covered by glacial Lake Peace, which was dammed against the retreating Laurentide ice sheet. Two levels of glacial Lake Peace are identified in the study area by closely spaced groups of strandlines and minor deltas lying at 805 to 840 m a.s.l., and 655 to 710 m a.s.l. Sedimentation associated with the upper of the two lake levels is marked by rhythmites of silt and clay deposited by turbid underflow, interbedded with diamicton deposited by debris flow. Dropstones and dump structures indicate common ice-rafting. Thick sequences are only found on the axes of major valleys, where sediment gravity flows were concentrated. Thin sequences of ice proximal glaciolacustrine sediments reflect topographic setting and do not indicate a short-lived lake. Retreat of the ice front resulted in a decrease in ice-rafted material and diamicton in sediments. The fall in lake level to the second stage resulted in deposition of sequences of vaguely laminated silt and clay close to the modern Beaverlodge River. These sediments were deposited by suspension settling from interflow of overflow of the Beaverlodge River as it entered the lake. Lake sedimentation was dominated by inflow from unglaciated areas, rather than the ice front.																			0300-9483						1991	20	3					241	257																WOS:A1991GL60500004

Assessment of the impact of natural processes on the content of heavy metals Lake Onego water	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												The article presents the results of studies conducted in 2014-2015 and 2018 in the water area and shores of Lake Onego, devoted to the study of natural and anthropogenic factors that affect the water quality of different areas of the lake. Among natural factors, river flow provides 50-70 % of chemical substances into the lake. However, in areas of the lake where there are no large tributaries, abrasion or erosion processes on shores play a special role. As a result of work in 2014-2015, morphogenetic classification of shores was done and seven types were highlighted: slightly modified, abrasion, abrasion-accumulative, accumulative, deltaic, lagoon and anthropogenic. The first attempts to carry out a correlation analysis of coastal processes' impact on water quality of the lake (heavy metals intake) were made. Geoecological research including water (24 samples), bottom (17 samples) and coastal (12 samples) sediments sampling with subsequent determination of Fe, Mn, Al, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Co and Cd content was conducted in the area of abrasion (Andoma Mountain) and abrasion-accumulative (Pukhta Bay) shores of Lake Onego in October 2018. The dissolved form of metals was determined in water and the mobile form of metals was determined in sediments. Concentrations of metals reflect the chemical composition of lake water in the autumn and exceed maximum permissible concentrations by 10 times for Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb and Al. According to the results of chemical analysis, correlation analysis was conducted on abrasion and erosion of lake shores and the impact on the quality of Lake Onego coastal waters. There is no influence of bottom sediments in the coastal zone on the content of heavy metals except Al. Statistically significant correlation (correlation coefficient 0.7) has been noted for Al.					; Terskii, Pavel/E-2035-2012	Strokov, Alexander/0000-0002-7356-3707; 													2541-9668	2587-585X					2020	65	1					146	171		10.21638/spbu07.2020.108	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/spbu07.2020.108													WOS:000539086300008

Metrics of structural change as indicators of chironomid community stability in high latitude lakes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and stability is challenging, espe-cially in high latitude regions that are predicted to experience the largest increases in ambient temperature. Global warming is likely to be a key driver of ecosystem change in freshwater lakes. Increased temperature can positively or negatively affect lake community composition through the loss of cold adapted taxa and the arrival of temperate or eurytopic taxa. Here, we analyse the likely effects of temperature-induced changes in taxonomic richness and compositional turnover of environmentally sensitive chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) across three regions northern North America, Norway, and Russia using existing datasets. Structural parameters (beta diversity, compositional disorder, and network skewness) were applied to model-simulated and empirical chironomid datasets across a large spatial temperature gradient. The analyses of empirical datasets showed changes in community structure across temperature gradients, suggesting varying states of ecosystem stability or instability. The comparison with null models enabled assessment as to whether these stresses agreed with expected patterns due to covarying summer temperature conditions or whether they deviated from expectations suggesting additional stress on the ecosystems. For all three regions, lakes in the mid-temperature range showed most evidence of relative ecosystem stability, with greater beta diversity, compositional disorder, and skewness, unanticipated by the modelled simulations. This is most likely due to more diverse habitats across the ecotone boundaries and additional factors that can influence ecosystem structures. Thus, we show that structural changes typical for ecosystem stability can be detected through changes in community structure across temperature gradients. This is important for understanding how lakes may change under current and future climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These trial tests represented the first such tests performed in the world. These tests were performed in Lake Ontario, on a 323 mm diameter pipe pile driven in 8 m of water. The tests were performed using a 0.6 MN Statnamic device and hydraulic catching mechanism with a specially designed hanging structure from which a submerged steel container was used to contain a mass of water. The goal of the testing was to investigate the potential for using water to replace concrete and steel for use as reaction mass for Statnamic tests. This paper also describes Statnamic test results from the first two Statnamic testing contracts for the Port of Lake Charles, Lake Charles, Louisiana, USA. These jobs were performed by Applied Foundation Testing, Inc. of Green Cove Springs, Florida, USA. These tests were performed on square concrete piles, with test loads ranging From 4.0 MN to 5.0 MN. This paper also summarizes the theoretical research conducted by Middendorp and Courage in 1995, which influenced the design of the actual water reaction mass assemblies for the experimental, work of 1998.																					90-5809-150-3				2000							609	616																WOS:000166376500081

A set of four paleoflood SWD beds was identified at the Pingduguan (PDG) sites and studied by field observations and laboratory analysis including particle-size distribution and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Hydrological reconstruction using the HEC-RAS model shows that the paleoflood peak discharges were between 39,000 and 50,220 m(3) s(-1). They are about double the largest gauged flood (24,000 m(3) s(-1)) that has occurred since 1976 along the Jin-Shaan Gorges. These extraordinary flood events were OSL dated to between 1800 and 1600 yr BP during which climatic deterioration and disasters were documented over the Yellow River basin. Various evidences show that severe flood and drought disasters during the episode resulted in frequent harvest failures, famines, social upheavals, and population reduction, invasions by nomads, and even the fall and replacement of the dynasties. Climate decline documented by proxy records such as tree-rings, stalagmites, ice-cores and lake sediments from over the world is in agreement with the paleoflood events identified along the Jin-Shaan Gorges. These mean that the extraordinary paleoflood events are closely related to increased climatic variability and instability. This result provides solid evidence for understanding the response of hydroclimatic system to global climate change in the semi-arid and sub-humid regions of the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The Arabian Gulf, which is a semi-enclosed sea, is prone to extensive whiting that covers tens of thousands of square kilometres. Despite the extent and frequency of whiting events in the Gulf, studies documenting the whiting phenomenon are lacking. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to detect, map and document the spatial and temporal distributions of whiting events in the Gulf using daily images acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites from 2002 to 2018. A method integrating a geographic object-based image analysis, the correlation-based feature selection technique (CFS), the adaptive boosting decision tree (AdaBoost DT) and the rule-based classification were used in the study to detect, quantify and assess whiting events in the Gulf from the MODIS data. Firstly, a multiresolution segmentation was optimised using unsupervised quality measures. Secondly, a set of spectral bands and indices were investigated using the CFS to select the most relevant feature(s). Thirdly, a generic AdaBoost DT model and a rule-based classification were adopted to classify the MODIS time series data. Finally, the developed classification model was compared with various tree-based classifiers such as random forest, a single DT and gradient boosted DT. Results showed that both the combination of the mean of the green spectral band and the normalised difference index between the green and blue bands (NDGB), or the combination of the NDGB and the colour index for estimating the concentrations of calcium carbonates (CI) of the image objects, were the most significant features for detecting whiting. Moreover, the generic AdaBoost DT classification model outperformed the other tested tree-based classifiers with an overall accuracy of 97.86% and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. The whiting events during the study period (2002-2018) occurred exclusively during the winter season (November to March) and mostly in February. Geographically, the whiting events covered areas ranging from 12,000 km(2) to 60,000 km(2) and were mainly located along the southwest coast of the Gulf. The duration of most whiting events was 2 to 6 days, with some events extending as long as 8 to 11 days. The study documented the spatiotemporal distribution of whiting events in the Gulf from 2002 to 2018 and presented an effective tool for detecting and motoring whiting events.					; Al-Ruzouq, Rami/G-5564-2014; A.Gibril, Mohamed/N-5291-2018	Al Mansoori, Saeed/0000-0001-8499-2809; Al-Ruzouq, Rami/0000-0001-7111-0061; Shanableh, Abdallah/0000-0002-9808-4120														2072-4292				MAY 2	2019	11	10							1193	10.3390/rs11101193	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11101193													WOS:000480524800051

Despite strong anthropogenic influences on the species' population dynamics due to cultural eutrophication and oligotrophication, intense fishing, and large-scale stocking, the influence of climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is apparent in the data set. This influence is significant although large-scale stocking of cold-bred larvae was performed to avoid a mismatch of larvae with their food. The importance of stocking on YCS, however, is unclear and was only detectable when analysing a subset of the data. In addition to climate variability a yet unidentified factor related to zooplankton suitability as food for fish larvae, and density-dependent mortality probably related to cannibalism do significantly influence YCS. The NAO seemed to influence YCS twofold, through temperature effects on egg development time and on larval growth rate. The first of these two mechanisms is related to the NAO via a time lag of 1 year due to the specific mixing dynamics of warm monomictic Lake Constance. Hence, a warm winter in the year before spawning results in earlier hatching of larvae, that is, hatching is decoupled from the actual meteorological conditions. This should make the larvae very prone to mismatch the dynamics of their food. However, we found no evidence for such a mismatch in this 52-year data set.

ARE ELEMENTAL AND STRONTIUM ISOTOPIC MICROCHEMISTRY OF OTOLITH AND HISTOMORPHOMETRICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VERTEBRAL BONE USEFUL TO RESOLVE THE EEL ANGUILLA OBSCURA STATUS IN LALOLALO LAKE IN WALLIS ISLAND?	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												Otolith Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and vertebral bone histomorphometry were used to investigate the life-history of Anguilla obscura eels from an enclosed lake, Lalolalo (Wallis Island in the Pacific), with no apparent connection with the sea. Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratio from the core region gives evidence of indisputable marine origin of eels caught in the lake suggesting that underground connections between the lake and the sea exist. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios recorded after the elver mark are undifferentiated from seawater ones, thus limiting their used as marker of entrance in the lake and movement. However, Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratio demonstrated that: 1) eels enter in the lake just after their metamorphosis and spend their entire adult life in the lake and 2) the lake chemistry is consistent with 1 % seawater-like contribution and 99 % basalt weathering and/or geothermal spring contribution. The vertebrae do not show a particular demineralization of bone matrix (45-52 %). Reversely, the study of bone compactness shows an important loss of bone that favors the hypothesis of a genital maturation that arises in the ecological state of the lake.					; Bareille, Gilles/AAS-3113-2020	Deschamps, Marie-Helene/0000-0001-6520-2090; Meunier, Francois/0009-0006-6183-3761; PECHEYRAN, Christophe/0000-0001-6503-4859; Berail, Sylvain/0000-0002-5637-3696													0240-8759						2015	65	1	1				29	39																WOS:000356777600005

In isolated wetlands, vegetation shift occurs over short time scales and leads to water deoxy-genation and chemically reduced sediments, conditions that favor the generation, accumulation and degassing of greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e. CH4, CO2 and N2O) to the atmosphere. However, the relationship between primary producer's growth forms, hydrological connectivity and GHGs concentration is poorly studied in the literature. A set of 18 freshwater wetlands including isolated and river-connected oxbow lakes, marshes and ponds with different vegetation growth forms was therefore monitored monthly on the annual scale. Potential GHGs diffusive fluxes towards the atmosphere were calculated and compared with direct measurements reported in peer-reviewed papers within a meta-analysis. Our results demonstrate a strong link between the colonization of free-floating plants and the onset of hypoxic conditions and accumulation of dissolved methane. Methane and carbon dioxide concentration peaked in late summer, when floating-leaved and free-floating vegetation covered 100% of the water surface. Carbon dioxide accumulation was particularly evident at hydrological connected wetlands, where nitrate pollution was likely responsible for the concomitant increment of dissolved nitrous oxide. As an increasing number of studies focuses on unravelling environmental drivers of GHGs emission from small lakes and ponds, we encourage to systematically consider the vegetation growth forms and the hydro-logical connectivity as major drivers of GHGs accumulation and evasion rates.

Modelling Subarctic watershed dissolved organic carbon response to hydroclimatic regime	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Shifts in hydroclimatic regimes associated with global climate change may impact freshwater availability and quality. In high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, where vast quantities of carbon are stored terrestrially, explaining landscape-scale carbon (C) budgets and associated pollutant transfer is necessary for understanding the impact of changing hydroclimatic regimes. We used a dynamic modelling approach to simulate streamflow, DOC concentration, and DOC export in a northern Canadian catchment that has undergone notable climate warming, and will continue to for the remainder of this century. The Integrated Catchment model for Carbon (INCA-C) was successfully calibrated to a multi-year period (2012-2016) that represents a range in hydrologic conditions. The model was subsequently run over 30-year periods representing baseline and two future climate scenarios. Average discharge is predicted to decrease under an elevated temperature scenario (22-27 % of baseline) but increase (116-175 % of baseline) under an elevated temperature and precipitation scenario. In the latter scenario the nival hydroclimatic regime is expected to shift to a com-bined nival and pluvial regime. Average DOC flux over 30 years is predicted to decrease (24-27 % of baseline) under the elevated temperature scenario, as higher DOC concentrations are offset by lower runoff. Under the elevated temperature and precipitation scenario, results suggest an increase in carbon export of 64-81 % above baseline. These increases are attributed to greater connectivity of the catchment. The largest increase in DOC export is expected to occur in early winter. These predicted changes in DOC export, particularly under a climate that is warmer and wetter could be part of larger eco-system change and warrant additional monitoring efforts in the region.					; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011	Whitfield, Colin/0000-0002-7618-3363; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		3						159382	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159382		OCT 2022						36240938					WOS:000907154900008
J	Selig, U; Schlungbaum, G				Selig, U; Schlungbaum, G			Longitudinal patterns of phosphorus and phosphorus binding in sediment of a lowland lake-river system	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In the Warnow River and its tributaries in North Germany, measurements were made to characterise the longitudinal patterns of nutrients in the riverbed and lake sediments. The sediment composition was analysed based on dry weight, organic matter, mean grain size and concentration of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, aluminium and sulfur. Sediment phosphate was investigated in more detail by means of a sequential chemical extration. The phosphate was differently bound to the sediment particles in the upstream region than in the impounded section of the Warnow River and ist tributaries. Accumulation of fine sediment with high P-concentrations was recorded in the lake sediments and in the impounded section of the river. These impounded sections were the most important P-pool in the whole catchment area and played an important role in P-retention in the river system. Organic matter concentration, P-accumulation and P-binding in the sediment of the impounded section is corresponding with those of lake sediments. During the summer, anoxic P-release from the sediment in the impounded section was measured and calculated. The reductant-soluble fraction of the P-fractionation underestimated the release under anoxic condition. Adsorbed phosphorus and organic phosphate play an important role in P-release in the impounded part of the river.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2002	472	1-3					67	76		10.1023/A:1016352613368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016352613368													WOS:000176811800008

Testing the steady-state water chemistry model predictions of pre-industrial lake pH with paleolimnolognical data from northern Sweden	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					5th International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior	JUN 25-30, 2006	Univ Calf Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA		Univ Calf Santa Cruz			Criteria are needed for distinguishing naturally acid water from that acidified by air pollution, especially in the organic-rich waters of northern Sweden. The Steady-State Water Chemistry Model (SSWC) was augmented to include organic acidity so that it could predict pre-industrial pH in organic-rich waters. The resulting model predictions of pre-industrial ANC and pH were then tested against diatom predictions of pre-industrial pH and alkalinity in 58 lakes from N. Sweden (after alkalinity was converted to ANC using the CBALK method). The SSWC Model's predictions of pre-industrial lake pH in N. Sweden did not correspond well with the diatom predictions, even when accounting for the uncertainty in the diatom model. This was due to the SSWC's sensitivity to short-term fluctuations in contemporary water chemistry. Thus the SSWC Model is not suitable for judging the acidification of individual lakes in areas such as northern Sweden where the degree of chronic acidification is small, or without a good average value of contemporary water chemistry. These results should be considered when assessing the accuracy of critical loads calculated using SSWC. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

But in supporting high-stakes decisions, where the ability to explain possible solutions is key to their acceptability and legitimacy, ML can fall short. Here, we develop a method, rooted in formal sensitivity analysis, to uncover the primary drivers behind ML predictions. Unlike many methods for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), this method (a) accounts for complex multi-variate distributional properties of data, common in environmental systems, (b) offers a global assessment of the input-output response surface formed by ML, rather than focusing solely on local regions around existing data points, and (c) is scalable and data-size independent, ensuring computational efficiency with large data sets. We apply this method to a suite of ML models predicting various water quality variables in a pilot-scale experimental pit lake. A critical finding is that subtle alterations in the design of some ML models (such as variations in random seed, functional class, hyperparameters, or data splitting) can lead to different interpretations of how outputs depend on inputs. Further, models from different ML families (decision trees, connectionists, or kernels) may focus on different aspects of the information provided by data, despite displaying similar predictive power. Overall, our results underscore the need to assess the explanatory robustness of ML models and advocate for using model ensembles to gain deeper insights into system drivers and improve prediction reliability.

These lakes spanned five vegetation zones, with the southern-most lakes located in boreal forest and the northern-most lakes located in mid-Arctic tundra. The lakes in the calibration are characterized by ranges in depth, summer surface-water temperature (SSWT), average July air temperature (AJAT) and pH of 15.5 m, 10.60A degrees C, 8.40A degrees C and 3.69, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that maximum depth, pH, AJAT, total nitrogen-unfiltered (TN-UF), Cl and Al capture a large and statistically significant fraction of the overall variance in the midge data. Inference models relating midge abundances and AJAT were developed using different approaches including: weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) and partial least squares (PLS). A chironomid-based inference model, based on a two-component WA-PLS approach, provided robust performance statistics with a high coefficient of determination (r (2) = 0.77) and low root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP = 1.03A degrees C) and low maximum bias. The use of a high-resolution gridded climate data set facilitated the development of the midge-based inference model for AJAT in a region with a paucity of meteorological stations and where previously only the development of a SSWT inference model was possible.					; Porinchu, DF/S-4360-2019	Rolland, Nicolas/0000-0001-9883-8124; Porinchu, David/0000-0002-0495-3082; Moser, Katrina/0000-0001-8633-5677; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2009	41	2					349	368		10.1007/s10933-008-9233-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9233-3													WOS:000262651500008

Source attribution and process analysis for atmospheric mercury in eastern China simulated by CMAQ-Hg	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The contribution from different emission sources and atmospheric processes to gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), particulate bound mercury (PBM) and mercury deposition in eastern China were quantified using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ-Hg) modeling system run with a nested domain. Natural sources (NAT) and six categories of anthropogenic mercury sources (ANTH) including cement production (CEM), domestic life (DOM), industrial boilers (IND), metal production (MET), coal-fired power plants (PP) and traffic (TRA) were considered for source apportionment. NAT were responsible for 36.6% of annual averaged GEM concentration, which was regarded as the most important source for GEM in spite of obvious seasonal variation. Among ANTH, the influence of MET and PP on GEM were most evident especially in winter. ANTH dominated the variations of GOM and PBM concentrations with contributions of 86.7 and 79.1 %, respectively. Among ANTH, IND were the largest contributor for GOM (57.5 %) and PBM (34.4 %) so that most mercury deposition came from IND. The effect of mercury emitted from out of China was indicated by a > 30% contribution to GEM concentration and wet deposition. The contributions from nine processes - consisting of emissions (EMIS), gas-phase chemical production/loss (CHEM), horizontal advection (HADV), vertical advection (ZADV), horizontal advection (HDIF), vertical diffusion (VDIF), dry deposition (DDEP), cloud processes (CLDS) and aerosol processes (AERO) - were calculated for process analysis with their comparison in urban and non-urban regions of the Yangtze River delta (YRD). EMIS and VDIF affected surface GEM and PBM concentrations most and tended to compensate each other all the time in both urban and non-urban areas. However, DDEP was the most important removal process for GOM with 7.3 and 2.9 ng m(-3) reduced in the surface of urban and non-urban areas, respectively, in 1 day. The diurnal profile variation of processes revealed the transportation of GOM from urban area to non-urban areas and the importance of CHEM/AERO in higher altitudes which partly caused diffusion of GOM downwards to non-urban areas. Most of the anthropogenic mercury was transported and diffused away from urban areas by HADV and VDIF and increased mercury concentrations in non-urban areas by HADV. Natural emissions only influenced CHEM and AERO more significantly than anthropogenic. Local emissions in the YRD contributed 8.5% more to GEM and similar to 30% more to GOM and PBM in urban areas compared to non-urban areas.					; Bieser, Johannes/R-2583-2017; WANG, TAO/E-3449-2016	Matthias, Volker/0000-0003-0519-8805; Bieser, Johannes/0000-0003-2938-3124; Zhu, Jialei/0000-0003-2057-8996; 													1680-7316	1680-7324					2015	15	15					8767	8779		10.5194/acp-15-8767-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-8767-2015													WOS:000359949700013

Messenger RNA levels fell after 4 days, and this trend continued after 16 days of exposure. In situ hybridization indicated that CYP1A mRNA was universally elevated in the brain of BNF-exposed fish and was mainly expressed in the endothelia and occasionally in the glial cells. CYP1A immunoreactivity was induced in the olfactory bulb and valvula cerebelli of BNF-treated fish. Other brain areas showed constitutive CYP1A immunoreactivity in both control and BNF-treated fish. Some BNF-treated fish contained multifocal hemorrhages in the brain tissue, and these fish had overall depressed CYP1A immunoreactivity in the brain. The relationship between transcriptional and translational effects of BNF exposure in the brain of juvenile lake trout is discussed.					; Li, Weiming/D-9615-2013; Chung-Davidson, Yu-Wen/L-6161-2019	Yun, Sang Seon/0000-0001-6723-0482; Chung-Davidson, Yu-Wen/0000-0001-5784-2653; 													0022-0949	1477-9145				APR	2004	207	9					1533	1542		10.1242/jeb.00919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00919								15037647					WOS:000221154300020

During the 6-12 week flow season, a hyporheic zone develops in the saturated sediment adjacent to the streams. Longer Dry Valley streams have higher concentrations of major ions than shorter streams. The longitudinal increases in Si and K suggest that primary weathering contributes to the downstream solute increase. The hypothesis that weathering reactions in the hyporheic zone control stream chemistry was tested by modeling the downstream increase in solute concentration in von Guerard Stream in Taylor Valley. The average rates of solute supplied from these sources over the 5.2 km length of the stream were 6.1 x 10(-9) mol Si L-1 m(-1) and 3.7 x 10(-9) mol K L-1 m(-1), yielding annual dissolved Si loads of 0.02-1.30 mol Si m(-2) of watershed land surface. Silicate minerals in streambed sediment were analyzed to determine the representative surface area of minerals in the hyporheic zone subject to primary weathering. Two strategies were evaluated to compute sediment surface area normalized weathering rates. The first applies a best linear fit to synoptic data in order to calculate a constant downstream solute concentration gradient, dC/dx (constant weathering rate contribution, CRC method); the second uses a transient storage model to simulate dC/dx, representing both hyporheic exchange and chemical weathering (hydrologic exchange, HE method). Geometric surface area normalized dissolution rates of the silicate minerals in the stream ranged from 0.6 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) to 4.5 x 10(-12) mol Si m(-2) s(-1) and 0.4 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1) to 1.9 x 10(-12) mol K m(-2) s(-1). These values are an order of magnitude lower than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in laboratory studies and are an order of magnitude greater than geometric surface area normalized weathering rates determined in a warmer, wetter setting in temperate basins, despite the cold temperatures, lack of precipitation and lack of organic material. These results suggest that the continuous saturation and rapid flushing of the sediment due to hyporheic exchange facilitates weathering in Dry Valley streams.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC 7	2002	38	12							1279	10.1029/2001WR000834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001WR000834													WOS:000181021000001

To elucidate the factors driving phytoplankton genus richness in the Danish landscape, we analyzed data derived from late-summer samplings in 195 Danish lakes and ponds in a spatially-explicit framework. To account for the uneven sampling of lakes in the monitoring data, we performed 1,000 permutations. A random set of 131 lakes was assembled and a single sample was selected randomly for each lake at each draw and all the analyses were performed on permuted data 1,000 times. The local environment was described by lake water chemistry, lake morphology, land-use in lake catchments, and climate. Analysis of the effects of four groups of environmental factors on the richness of the main groups of phytoplankton revealed contrasting patterns. Lake water chemistry was the strongest predictor of phytoplankton richness for all groups, while lake morphology also had a strong influence on Bacillariophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Dinophyceae, and Euglenophyceae richness. Climate and land-use in catchments contributed only little to the explained variation in phytoplankton richness, although both factors had a significant effect on Bacillariophyceae richness. Notably, total nitrogen played a more important role for phytoplankton richness than total phosphorus. Overall, models accounted for ca. 30% of the variation in genus richness for all phytoplankton combined as well as the main groups separately. Local spatial structure (< 30 km) in phytoplankton richness suggested that connectivity among lakes and catchment-scale processes might also influence phytoplankton richness in Danish lakes.

In other tests adults of some carabid species responded to volatiles from habitats other than their own, and to arbitrarily selected individual components and mixtures of components of saline lakeshore volatiles. These results suggest that shore insects recognize habitat allelochemics and aggregate in areas where these compounds are emitted by resident microflora. It is proposed that some habitat allelochemics are short-range signals that indicate locations of microhabitats used by shore insects for behaviors such as feeding, mating, and resting; in constrast, long-range allelochemics allow these insects to select their habitats from a distance. This hypothesis provides a mechanism for explaining how different shore habitats are partitioned among different species of shore insects.																			0098-0331	1573-1561				MAY	1988	14	5					1441	1454		10.1007/BF01020147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01020147								24276292					WOS:A1988P024500010
J	Yao, B; Liu, QQ; Gao, Y; Cao, ZX				Yao, Bo; Liu, Qingquan; Gao, Yong; Cao, Zhixian			Characterizing vertical migration of Microcystis aeruginosa and conditions for algal bloom development based on a light-driven migration model	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Light-driven vertical migration is critical in dense aggregation of Microcystis aeruginosa during algal blooms under reduced turbulence conditions in natural water bodies. This study examined the vertical migration characteristics of Microcystis aeruginosa in calm water based on a colony migration model with consideration of cell density change, and demonstrated the effects of mucilage fraction, colony size, irradiance intensity, and water turbidity. The results suggest that colonies with larger radii and under higher irradiance usually had a larger daily averaged retention time at the water surface (DRT). In addition to colony size, mucilage was found to be important in changing the vertical migration behavior of Microcystis colonies, in which increasing mucilage volume fraction can increase the migrating velocity of the colony as well as the length of time it remains at the water surface. Increase of light extinction also favors the aggregation of colonies at the surface. An approximate critical value of 2400 mu mol photons m(2) s(-1) for maximum irradiance was found for persistent algal bloom development under the given simulation conditions. Extremely small colonies exposed to irradiance below the critical value were not likely to migrate to the water surface to form algal blooms. According to the DRT values, three regions with different ranges of irradiance and colony size were proposed as the critical conditions for algal bloom development. Rough comparisons to field observations suggested that these results were reasonable and meaningful, and have the potential to be applied in real cases following further validation by more detailed investigations.

J	Forcat, F; Roget, E; Figueroa, M; Sánchez, X				Forcat, Francesc; Roget, Elena; Figueroa, Manuel; Sanchez, Xavier			Earth rotation effects on the internal wave field in a stratified small lake: Numerical simulations	LIMNETICA												The Princeton Ocean Model was applied to the Sau Reservoir, a medium-sized Mediterranean reservoir (5.7 km(2)) located in Catalonia, Spain, during the summer season, when the water column is continuously stratified and forced by a breeze regime with velocities of up to 3-4 m/s. Based on our simulations, the internal wave field has been analysed and the numerical results compared with the field data previously analysed by other authors. The model adequately reproduces all the significant modes observed. The simulations show the importance of rotational modes on the internal wave field. The Burger number S for all rotating internal waves is on the order of 10(-1), and the internal Rossby radius R is on the order of 10(2) m, that is, smaller than the width of the lacustrine area of the reservoir (10(3) m). Specifically, two rotating third vertical modes were found during the analysed period: the first, a 24-hour period, was forced by the wind and the phase rotated clockwise; and the second, a 12-hour period, can be interpreted as a second azimuthal horizontal mode of a Poincare wave. A second vertical mode of 8 hours was observed to rotate counter clockwise, although in this case the Earth's rotation appears not to have been of importance because the same results could be obtained without taking into account the Coriolis force. Finally, two first vertical modes, one of 6 hours and the other of 5 hours, were observed, although with no rotational behaviour. These modes correspond, respectively, to the first and second horizontal stationary modes. Further analysis of the simulated velocities shows the existence of a net clockwise flow along the shore as a consequence of the dominant mode of 24 hours, with a mean velocity of 0.5 m/s that reverses at a distance of about 300 m from the coast. Preliminary results based on the simulated velocity field predict horizontal trajectories of passive particles of up to 1 km per day and vertical displacements of up to 5 m across the entire water column.

The largest part of this Region has the status of the National Park since 1983. International recognition of the importance of Skadar Lake ecosystems come in 1995, when the Lake was designated as Ramsar site. The geographical information system (GIS) that we have created has provided an excellent tool for valorization and protection of all natural values and potential of Skadar Lake Region. The GIS of Skadar Lake Region is organized for the territory of about 4500 km(2) and is divided (by type and format) into various data forms: Raster data: georeferenced raster topographic maps, satellite imaginary, digital model of precipitation, digital model of temperature; Vector data: geology, hydrogeology, hydrology (Adriatic sea, lakes, rivers, underground water, springs), soil, temperature, precipitation, irrigation areas, vegetation, biomes, border of protected areas, locality of important animal species, other important localities (archeological, cultural), border of NP, state border; Digital elevation model (DEM) - resolution 20m and Database. Except of ecological conservation this information system will be helpful to a wide circle of users in the areas of natural, biotechnical, technical, economic and social sciences.																			0350-7599	1821-2808					2007	57						483	493																WOS:000410000300057

The present study focuses on harnessing the potential of a multispectral sensor-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for cryosphere studies over the polar ice sheet in cDML (Schirmacher Oasis) region of East Antarctica, conducted as part of the 42nd and 43rd Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ISEA), under the aegis of National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, during austral summer period from 2022 to 2023. The surveyed area (similar to 100 acres) encompasses a segment of the ice sheet frontal edge outer margin, situated near the Maitri Indian research base at Schirmacheroasen, and includes a melt pond/supraglacial lake. The results indicate that the ice sheet frontal edge segment experienced a decrease in elevation of 0.25 meters with a total mass reduction of 13.6 kilotons during one-week period. The supraglacial lake accumulated meltwater with an average depth ranging from 0.25 to 1.6 meters, covering an area spanning from 9.1 x 10(3) square meters to 24.7 x 10(3) square meters. The ultra-high resolution multispectral UAV data also revealed dynamic changes in various cryo-facies classes, including water bodies/meltwater, frozen meltwater, dry and wet snow, debris/bare ice, and bedrock during the study period over the study area. This study represents a pioneering effort in assessing the region near the Maitri research base in both spatial and temporal scales. It also marks the first application of UAV surveying techniques with the integration of in-situ data from the Pressure Sensor Assembly (PSA) to examine and understand its complex intra-seasonal dynamics and characteristics. The research team is the first Indian group to employ UAVs for scientific research in the Antarctic region, which is a notable advancement in Indian scientific exploration and contributes to the expanding knowledge of the Antarctic region.

Such enrichment, called "mountain cold-trapping", is attributed to a transition from the atmospheric gas phase to particles, rain droplets, snowflakes, and Earth's surface at the lower temperatures prevailing at higher elevations. Milk sampled repeatedly from cows that had grazed at three different altitudes in Switzerland during one summer was analyzed for a range of persistent organic pollutants. Mountain cold-trapping significantly increased air-to-milk transfer factors of most analytes. As a result, the milk of cows grazing at higher altitudes was more contaminated with substances that have regionally uniform air concentrations (hexachlorobenzene, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, endosulfan sulfate). For substances that have sources, and therefore higher air concentrations, at lower altitudes (polychlorinated biphenyls, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), alpine milk has lower concentrations, but not as low as would be expected without mountain cold-trapping. Differences in the elevational gradients in soil concentrations and air-to-milk transfer factors highlight that cold-trapping of POPs in pastures is mostly due to increased gas-phase deposition as a result of lower temperatures causing higher uptake capacity of plant foliage, whereas cold-trapping in soils more strongly depends on wet and dry particle deposition. Climatic influences on air-to-milk transfer of POPs needs to be accounted for when using contamination of milk lipids to infer contamination of the atmosphere.

Regions have different physiographic characteristics with fractured mafic/intermediate and felsic rocks. Samples were taken from deep wells and springs. Concentrations were field measured by two methods: i) scintillator, coupled to a photomultiplier, and ii) passive method, using Nuclear Track Detectors. Qualitatively, results of Rn-222 measured with both techniques are comparable only when concentrations have values less than 1 Bq/l. For the Basin of Mexico City the data shows an average difference of 0.13 Bq/l. Results of Rn-222 concentrations in 46 groundwater samples indicate that the data are below 11.1 Bq/l, with both methodologies. Low concentrations of Rn-222 in the Basin of Mexico City are related to the mafic intermediate composition rocks such as basalt. The anomalies with high values are correlated with the transition zone between volcanic units and clays from ancient lakes. In San Luis Potos 10 samples show an average of 4.2 Bq/l. These concentrations compared with those of the Basin of Mexico City are related to the composition of the felsic (rhyolite) volcanic rocks.

Temporal and spatial variability in the phytoplankton community of Myall Lakes, Australia, and influences of salinity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The variability in the phytoplankton communities of the Myall Lakes, a series of four interconnected coastal lakes on the lower north coast of New South Wales, was studied between 1999 and 2002. There was considerable spatial variability across the lake system. Bombah Broadwater experienced blooms of Anabaena in 1999 and early 2000, but these were replaced from late 2000 onwards by Chroococcus and a variety of eukaryotic taxa, particularly flagellates and diatoms. In comparison, the phytoplankton community of Myall Lake was dominated for much of the study period by Chroococcus, Merismopedia and chlorophyte taxa. The sites located midway between these two main lakes represent an ecotone, with elements of the phytoplanktonic flora of both main lakes being present. Changes in phytoplankton community composition in Bombah Broadwater occurred fairly frequently. In contrast, the phytoplankton community in Myall Lake changed little during the course of the study and can be considered as being at long-term equilibrium. The reasons for this lie in the morphology and hydrology of the lake system, which in turn create gradients in a number of physico-chemical water quality attributes. Bombah Broadwater is influenced by episodic and stochastic freshwater inflows from the upper Myall River catchment, and in times of drought by saline marine incursions via the lower Myall River. Myall Lake however represents a cul-de-sac, with only a small hydraulic connection to the remainder of the lake system. As it has little input from its small catchment, the limnological conditions within this lake remain relatively constant for long periods of time. Although no patterns of seasonal succession were discernable in any of the lakes, some longer-term (annual) changes did occur, and certain taxa displayed enhanced growth in summer. Salinity was found to be an important factor in determining phytoplankton community composition and abundance. Canonical Correspondence Analysis of phytoplankton and environmental data for all sites combined, showed ammonia, total nitrogen and salinity (measured as electrical conductivity) to have the most influence on the phytoplankton community composition and abundance. Anabaena growth was positively related to ammonia concentration and negatively related to conductivity.

The results obtained show that under the same experiment conditions (slow saline, marine and rapid saline stress) the survival time of the two bacteria varies considerably. In sewage treated by stabilization ponds, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli exhibit the similar survival rates. T-90 evaluated for Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in the winter period was, respectively, 125 and 132 h. In brackish water the survival rate of Salmonella typhimurium was generally higher than that of Escherichia coli. When these two bacteria were suspended in stabilization ponds effluent and rapidly mixed with brackish water, survival time was particularly short, whereas it was prolonged when the bacteria were submitted to a gradual increase in salinity. Biological factors, and in particular predation, can play an important role in eliminating enteric bacteria during pond system treatment, but their efficiency is supposed to diminish significantly when there is an environmental change such as the discharge of pond system effluent into brackish water. This can explain the increase of enteric bacteria survival.																			0043-1354					FEB	1995	29	2					459	465		10.1016/0043-1354(94)00188-D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)00188-D													WOS:A1995QB74700008

As the lakes offer a pristine environment in a beautiful landscape and are located in the vicinity of the capital city Addis Ababa, they are highly threatened by unsustainable tourism, shoreline and crater rim modifications, water abstraction and land grabbing. We provide a first limnological description to establish baseline data against which future environmental and biological changes can be monitored. The lakes are located above 2,800 m elevation with no surface outflow and generally show low concentrations of ions, displaying an equal distribution of readily soluble components like Na or K throughout the water column, but distinct oxygen depletion in greater depths linked to rising concentrations of Fe and Mn, which indicates subterranean springs. Based on nutrients, chlorophyll a, and water transparency, lakes Dendi and Wonchi are classified as oligotrophic and Ziqualla as oligo-mesotrophic. The phytoplankton community is dominated by coccal green algae, desmids and dinoflagellates in lakes Dendi and Wonchi, typical for unpolluted dilute waterbodies; whereas chlorococcales, in particular Botryococcus braunii and benthic diatoms, prevail in Ziqualla. The zooplankton fauna is depauperate, comprising a total of 11 rotifer taxa and 13 crustaceans. Copepods were the most abundant group and contributed over 60% to the total zooplankton abundance in all three lakes, followed by rotifers and cladocerans. The conservation significance of these lakes lies predominantly in their representation of dilute, nutrient-poor highland lake systems that support diverse biota assemblages like desmids and daphnids, which are highly sensitive to eutrophication.					; Michael, Schagerl/AAC-3356-2021; Schagerl, Michael/AAC-3356-2021	Jirsa, Franz/0000-0002-4926-3261; Schagerl, Michael/0000-0002-8277-7205													1940-0829						2014	7	3					365	381		10.1177/194008291400700302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/194008291400700302													WOS:000347644000003

J.; Lev, Einat; Thelen, Wes; Fee, David			Shallowly driven fluctuations in lava lake outgassing (gas pistoning), Kilauea Volcano	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Lava lakes provide ideal venues for directly observing and understanding the nature of outgassing in basaltic magmatic systems. Kilauea Volcano's summit lava lake has persisted for several years, during which seismic and infrasonic tremor amplitudes have exhibited episodic behavior associated with a rise and fall of the lava surface ("gas pistoning"). Since 2010, the outgassing regime of the lake has been tied to the presence or absence of gas pistoning. During normal behavior (no gas pistoning), the lake is in a "spattering" regime, consisting of higher tremor amplitudes and gas emissions. In comparison, gas piston events are associated with an abrupt rise in lava level (up to 20 m), during which the lake enters a "non-spattering" regime with greatly decreased tremor and gas emissions. We study this episodic behavior using long-term multidisciplinary monitoring of the lake, including seismicity, infrasound, gas emission and geochemistry, and time-lapse camera observations. The non-spattering regime (i.e. rise phase of a gas piston cycle) reflects gas bubbles accumulating near the top of the lake, perhaps as a shallow foam, while spattering regimes represent more efficient decoupling of gas from the lake. We speculate that the gas pistoning might be controlled by time-varying porosity and/or permeability in the upper portions of the lava lake, which may modulate foam formation and collapse. Competing models for gas pistoning, such as deeply sourced gas slugs, or dynamic pressure balances, are not consistent with our observations. Unlike other lava lakes which have cyclic behavior that is thought to be controlled by deeply sourced processes, external to the lake itself, we show an example of lava lake fluctuations driven by cycles of activity at shallow depth and close to the lake's surface. These observations highlight the complex and unsteady nature of outgassing from basaltic magmatic systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hypolimnetic SO42- reduction (4.56 +/- 0.73 g (S) m(-2) d(-1)) forming Sigma H2S(44.71 +/- 17.57 mg Sigma H2S m(-2) d(-1)), leading to iron sulfide precipitation (5.62 +/- 1.72 mg FeS m(-2) d(-1)) and dissolved iron depletion in the hypolimnion has a major influence on benthic P mobilization and release. The most important inorganic S pool is the CRS (FeS2 + S-0 + H2S; 15.1% total S), being 1.3 to 6.6 times higher than the AVS (FeS + H2S) in the uppermost 0 - 8 an sediment. This diminishes the ability of the sediment to bind P (indicated by 14.6% loosely bound P (NH4Cl-P) and an exhaustion of the redox-sensitive P (BD-P) leading to interstitial water P concentrations up to 10.8 mg l(-1) and P release rates of 2.64 +/- 0.56 mg P mg d(-1). As a consequence the P content of the lake increased fourfold within 58 days.																			0049-6979					OCT	1997	99	1-4					391	399		10.1023/A:1018383221469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018383221469													WOS:A1997XW68200042
J	Yoshida, Y				Yoshida, Y			Relationships between the dominant occurrence of Uroglena americana and water quality and meteorological factors in the north basin of Lake Biwa	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												In the north basin of Lake Biwa, harmful dinoflagellate Uroglena americana occurred dominantly, causing bad-smelling tap water in late spring for several years. The relationships between the abundance of U. americana and water quality in the north basin and the meteorological conditions of Lake Biwa were examined. The changes of water quality in the north basin (Station A) of Lake Biwa in early May of 1980-1993 showed that the fluctuation of WT (water temperature), DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus), TN:TP (total nitrogen:total phosphorus), DIN:DIP (dissolved inorganic nitrogen:dissolved inorganic phosphorus), and TP:DIP ratios were remarkable. The comparison of each average water quality with regard to the dominant phytoplankton in early May of 1980-1993 showed that U. americana occurred in the Raters with water qualities near the mean values, excepting comparatively high WT. The species also occurred in the years with meteorological conditions from mid April to early May close to the mean. These features of water quality and meteorological conditions suggested that the alga was a common species in early May and the control of the dominant occurrences resulted from abnormal water quality and meteorological conditions.																			0021-5392					JUL	1997	63	4					594	599																WOS:A1997XV58500018
J	Schoner, W; Schoner, M				Schoner, W; Schoner, M			Effects of glacier retreat on the outbursts of Goesvatnet, southwest Spitsbergen, Svalbard	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Effects of the retreat of Gasbreen, southwest Spitsbergen, Svalbard, on the evolution of the ice-dammed lake Goesvatnet are shown for the period 1899-1991. The retreat and lowering of the damming ice masses have changed not only the stored lake volume, the lake geometry and the elevation, slope and length of the subglacial outlet tunnel, but also the frequency and magnitude of outburst floods of Goesvatnet. For the estimation of peak discharges of outburst floods we computed an unbiased regression equation related to the progressive enlargement of subglacial tunnels using lake volume data and peak discharge data from the literature. The derived equation is very similar to the original form of the Clague-Mathews formula and answers the question why this formula has worked well in many cases. Peak discharges of Goesvatnet in various years were estimated by means of the derived equation. Effects of the changed lake geometry as well as the changed length and slope of the subglacial outlet tunnel on the discharge during outbursts will be discussed by means of the Nye-Clarke model. Observation of an outburst of Goesvatnet in summer 1991 indicates that the outbursts may have been triggered by pressure decrease in the subglacial outlet tunnel during increased discharge, whereas flotation of the ice dam can be excluded.					; Schöner, Wolfgang/AAW-8026-2020	Schoner, Wolfgang/0000-0001-6546-0639; 													0022-1430						1997	43	144					276	282		10.3189/S0022143000003221	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/S0022143000003221													WOS:A1997YH31100008

Semi-Automated Inquiry of Fish Launch Angle and Speed for Hazard Analysis	FISHES												This study investigated the leap characteristics of rainbow trout (also known as steelhead) (Oncorhynchus mykiss) present in the Laurentian Great Lakes. To aid in the collection and annotation of leaps, a custom web application was developed and through the labeling of key markers, the launch speed, launch angle, and length of the fish were calculated. Data collection took place during migratory runs in the spring of 2022 and 2023 that resulted in 173 total leaps annotated with mean launch angles of 58.73 and 68.2 degrees, in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The mean launch speed normalized by body length was consistent across years at 8.6 body lengths per second. The integration of leaping data with computational fluid dynamics simulations revealed steelhead launch angle aligns closely with the water velocity direction as the velocity magnitude increases. Applications of this study include hazard analyses for unintended escapement and informed design of intelligent migratory barriers such as those to be developed at FishPass, an instream research facility under design for the Boardman (Ottaway) River in Traverse City, MI, USA.

J	Tanaka, LL; Ban, S; Kumagai, M				Tanaka, Lidia L.; Ban, Syuhei; Kumagai, Michio			Spring ammonium maximum in the mid-depth layer of Lake Biwa, Japan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The spatio-temporal variation in ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) profiles was investigated in the North Basin of Lake Biwa in 2002, 2004, and 2005 and in the Uso River in 2004-2005. The in-lake concentration of NH4-N was low throughout the water column, except between late April and mid-June, when a distinct maximum developed between 10 and 25 m depth, in and below the thermocline. This layer extended offshore from both east and west boundaries to the center of the lake. By comparing water temperature estimates from the Uso River with water temperatures measured in the lake, we hypothesize that cooler water intrudes into the lake during the night at depths between 8 and 28 m. The intrusions are likely more pronounced from mid to late May when the NH4-N concentration in the Uso River is highest. This suggests that riverine input is an important factor in the formation of the mid-depth ammonium maximum in Lake Biwa. These findings underscore the importance of fluvial discharge and lateral transport of dissolved nutrients in temperate lakes.

All strains were thermophilic and capable of growth on xylan. On the basis of morphological, physiological and phylogenetic studies the new aerobic isolates resemble the thermophilic species Bacillus thermoleovorans while the facultative anaerobic isolate LB3A resembles the facultative anaerobic thermophilic species Bacillus flavothermus. When grown on xylan as sole carbon source, all isolates produce thermoactive xylanases. Xylanases from strains K-3d and LB3A are active al temperatures between 40 and 90 degrees C and pH values between 5.0 and 9.0. Applying SDS-PAGE the crude xylanase complex of isolate K-3d was shown to be composed of two active bands, with molecular masses of 40 and 69 kDa. The crude xylanase complex of isolate LB3A, on the other hand, is composed of at least four activity bands with molecular masses ranging from 80 to 130 kDa. Due to the product pattern of xylan hydrolysis both enzymes are classified as endoxylanases. The xylanolytic enzyme system of isolate K-3d produces xylotriose, xylotetraose and larger xylooligosacharides, whereas the xylanases from isolate LB3A release xylotetraose as the major product of hydrolysis.

J	Ludikova, AV				Ludikova, A. V.			Diatom Assemblages in Sediment Traps in Lake Onega	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The first study of the composition and structure of the diatom assemblages from sediment traps installed in different parts of Lake Onega is presented. A total of 171 species and intraspecific diatom taxa belonging to 59 genera have been identified. The predominance of planktonic diatoms is favored by large depths of the lake and a small area of the littoral zone. Aulacoseiraislandica and A. subarctica, the most abundant species in spring phytoplankton in Lake Onega, dominate in the sediment-trap diatom assemblages. In the sites subjected to anthropogenic eutrophication, Aulacoseira ambigua is numerous as well. Lindavia radiosa and Pantocsekiella tripartita are among the subdominating species in a number of sites, while P. schumannii,Stephanodiscus neoastraea, and Stephanodiscus sp. are less common. Higher proportions of periphytic Tabellaria fenestrata are recorded at the sites with the largest areas colonized by macrophytes. Neutrophilous oligo-mesotrophic and oligo-hypereutrophic taxa prevail in the diatom assemblages in all sampling sites. The predominance of two or three species in the diatom assemblage results in low values of the floristic diversity index. More diverse diatom assemblages are found in rather isolated bays. Concentrations of diatom valves and chrysophyte cysts in sediment traps material are also calculated.

A detailed luminescence study of aeolian, fluvial and aeolian-fluvial records from the Tiekui Dunefield (TKD) and its margins in the eastern QB reveals paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes during the MIS 3 (ca. 60-32 ka). The records, dated by post -Infrared Infrared Stimulated Luminescence (pIRIR), provide the first aeolian MIS 3 ages in the QB thanks to preservation by overlaying fluvial deposition in the dunefield margins and demonstrate the aeolian expansion of the TKD compared to its modern extent. Complemented by aeolian records in nearby regions, these deposits reflect intensified dune activity in an arid and windy climate and with adequate glacier-derived alluvial -domi-nated sand supply. These results do not support a significant increase in precipitation from the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). Comparisons of new ages derived from pIRIR and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) of quartz in this study suggest that some published quartz OSL ages of the QB may be underestimated, even below 90 Gy (ca. 30 ka, with normal dose rates of 2.8 Gy/ka). The revised chronology questions previously suggested hypotheses of the existence of a mega Qaidam Lake in the upwind reaches of the basin, under an extremely strong ASM during the MIS 3. We propose a conceptual aeolian-fluvial geomorphic model that demonstrates the paleoclimatic value of aeolian-fluvial records and where and how fluvial process can erode or preserve ancient and previously untapped aeolian records.					; yu, lupeng/AAX-5883-2021	Yu, LuPeng/0000-0002-3014-705X; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106354	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106354		MAY 2022											WOS:000804506700003
J	Pantu, IM				Pantu, Ileana Maria			WATER AS ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE CAROL I PARK IN BUCHAREST	SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES B-HORTICULTURE												The Carol I Park in Bucharest was designed in 1906 by the French landscape architect Edouard Redont in a mixed style. The initial composition of the park incorporated water as one of its main elements. Water was used in various forms: lake, water mirror, jet, spring, stream and cascade. Its forms were gradually thought from the city towards the heart of the park, from artificial to natural, from the classical to the landscaping style. With a sinuous contour, a lake encapsulated three islands with expo pavilions. In front of the lake, on a hill, Redont placed a cascade with a grotto and a group of statues in a romantic French style. Water was driven from it towards the lake in two winding canals. The main alley in a geometric style was dotted by neoclassic water mirrors with jets whose breadth grows from the park's entrance towards the lake. In 1960, The Carol I Park was radically transformed and lost most of its French influence (the cascade, the basin with jets etc.). The presence of the lake was diminished through a monumental bridge that crosses it.																			2285-5653	2286-1580					2019	63	1					471	478																WOS:000489993900069
J	McCormick, JH; Leino, RL				McCormick, JH; Leino, RL			Factors contributing to first-year recruitment failure of fishes in acidified waters with some implications for environmental research	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Factors that make fish particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental acidification during their first year of life are examined. This perspective is based largely on the results of research carried on concurrently in the field (the Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, acidification study, 1984-1990) and in the laboratory using water tailored to mimic that of Little Rock Lake. We discuss ways in which seasonal changes influence both the environmental challenges encountered by fishes and their ability to deal with those challenges. The vulnerability of a species may be based as much on its life history (e.g., synchrony of sensitive or resistant life stages with maximum pH challenges) as on its anatomy and physiology. The ordering of acid sensitivity of species or of life stages is based on a dynamic balancing of energy and ion uptake, storage, and loss. These processes, in turn, are linked to the length of the growing season (net uptake phase) and the winter fasting period (net loss phase). Each species and each life stage varies in its capacity to achieve this life-sustaining balance of energy and ion flux. The season and environment have an influence both on the acid challenges present and the ability of each species and life stage to cope with those challenges. One consequence of seasonality is that, in northern latitudes, the embryo-larval stage (generally considered to be the most acid sensitive) may not be the stage most susceptible to the effects of low pH. Rather, the first-year overwintering juvenile stage may be the most vulnerable, often as a result of chronic ionoregulatory failure involving damage to gill chloride cells. Anthropogenic factors are bringing about environmental changes at rates that exceed the capacity of many organisms to adjust to them, especially early life history stages. Our results support the view that aquatic toxicological studies would often benefit from increased attention to interactions involving the season, the water chemistry, and the life history stage that is present.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1999	128	2					265	277		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0265:FCTFYR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0265:FCTFYR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000081212900005

It was found that the investigated waters were additionally contaminated by nitrogen compounds. This is illustrated by increased values of NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ concentrations of the investigated waters in 2013 to max. values 0,28 (N-NO3/dm(3)), 0,103 (N-NO2/dm(3)) and 0,34 ( N-NH4/dm(3)), causing water quality deterioration in the lake by one class of quality compared to 2008 (where the max. values amounted to 0,39 (N-NO3/dm(3)), 0,016 (N-NO2/dm(3)) and 0,13 (N-NH4/dm(3)), which led to accelerated water eutrophication in the lake in 2008-2013.

The objectives of this study were to determine, the amount of catchment-derived organic carbon accumulated in sediments of a reservoir of North Thailand and to relate it with the history of cultivation and rainfall regime in the watershed. Over a twelve-years period (1995-2006) since impoundment sediment delivery was high (ca. 19.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The yearly supply of catchment-derived material was composed of coarse sediment deposits near the main inlets and of fine laminated sediment accumulations in deep-water environments. Their stable carbon isotope composition indicated that soil organic matter was the main source of organic carbon preserved in sediments (ca. 83 wt.%). Fine sediments derived from suspended loads exported from the watershed by runoff and stream waters were related to erosive rainfall, to the extent of area under annual cropping and to crop change with a marked increase after the replacement of beans by maize. However, sediment accumulation did not respond linearly to extreme rainfall events, as shown by the supply of nearly 48% of the total amount of sediments by a single exceptional flood. Total organic carbon storage in sediments reached ca. 23.8 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2006, twelve years after impoundment, falling in the upper range of small to medium size reservoirs with agricultural catchments.

A revision of the higher taxonomy of the Afrotropical freshwater crabs (Decapoda: Brachyura) with a discussion of their biogeography	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The higher taxonomy of the 20 known genera of Afrotropical freshwater crabs is revised to reflect the evolutionary relationships revealed by the consensus of a series of recent morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies of the group. The Afrotropical freshwater crab genera fall into two monophyletic groups, one from Socotra with two genera (Potamidae) and another that includes the remaining 18 genera. The latter group, which includes the bulk of the region's freshwater crab fauna, forms a well-supported monophyletic clade. We recognize two monophyletic sister groups (subfamilies) within the Potamonautidae, one for seven genera from Africa (the Potamonautinae) and one for 11 genera from Africa, the Seychelles, and Madagascar (the Deckeniinae). The Deckeniinae includes two monophyletic groups (tribes), one with seven genera from Madagascar (the Hydrothelphusini), and one with four genera from Africa and the Seychelles (the Deckeniini). The Deckeniini is further divided here into two subtribes, the Deckeniina and the Globonautina. The Platythelphusidae is not recognized, and the Deckeniidae and Globonautinae are lowered in rank. There is no phylogenetic support for the continued inclusion of any genus from the Afrotropical region in the Gecarcinucidae which is treated here as an exclusively Oriental family. The Afrotropical freshwater crabs (excluding those from Socotra) form a monophyletic assemblage that has no representatives outside of the region.

J	McDermid, SS; Winter, J				McDermid, Sonali Shukla; Winter, Jonathan			Anthropogenic forcings on the climate of the Aral Sea: A regional modeling perspective	ANTHROPOCENE												The Aral Sea was formerly one of the world's largest lakes and supported critical ecosystem services, fisheries, and major shipping routes. It was also situated in a rapidly industrializing agricultural region and, as such, multiple anthropogenic forcings have modified the Aral's regional environmental conditions over the latter 20th century. In particular, rising atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations coupled with intensive water resource use have had significant regional climate impacts. Sustained abstractions from regional rivers as an irrigation resource for intensified agricultural production has led to the rapid desiccation of the Aral Sea. As of summer 2014, only 10% of its historic extent remained. This paper reports modeling experiments to elucidate the climatic changes resulting from both increased GHG concentrations and an idealized disappearance of the Aral Sea. We utilized the MIT Regional Climate Model to perform 30-year experiments of pre-desiccated and fully desiccated Aral Sea conditions under moderate and enhanced GHG forcings. Complete desiccation combined with the GHG forcings resulted in substantial increases in summertime net longwave radiation, sensible heating, and surface temperature. Additionally, large reductions in evapotranspiration altered the regional soil moisture - surface temperature relationship. Furthermore, a completely desiccated Aral Sea heightened the GHG-induced regional warming. These results demonstrate how a total loss of the Aral Sea might exacerbate regional climate change. At the same time, they suggest that some of the regional warming and moisture regime shifts could be alleviated with the Aral Sea's restoration, requiring the implementation of conservation practices and improved regional water governance.

East Asian monsoon evolution and reconciliation of climate records from Japan and Greenland during the last deglaciation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												East Asian monsoon (EAM) evolution during the last deglaciation has been shown repeatedly to be aligned with paleoclimatic changes in the North Atlantic based on climate reconstructions comparing Asian speleothem records with Greenland ice cores In contrast to this finding paleoclimatic reconstructions based on Lake Suigetsu sediment cores suggest that past EAM variability in Japan was not always coherent with climatic variability recorded in Greenland ice cores We resolve this discrepancy using an absolute-dated stalagmite delta O-18 record that covers the period between 15 5 and 107 thousand years before present (ka before AD 1950) This stalagmite record is from nearby Maboroshi cave Japan and shows climate changes that are synchronous with those of Chinese caves and Greenland ice cores Our results support an effective teleconnection between low and high latitudinal climate systems during the transitions into the Bolling-Allerod (BA) warming at 146 ka and the Younger Dryas cooling at 12 8 ka in the North Atlantic However our results also indicate monsoonal intensification during the BA coincident with decreasing temperatures in Greenland from 146 to 12 8 ka We explain this decoupling as a result of the interhemispheric bipolar seesaw climate system Discrepancies between Lake Suigetsu radiocarbon age data sets and other radiocarbon calibration archives can also be removed when our Maboroshi record is used to adjust the Lake Suigetsu age model as well as resolving temporal ambiguities in the Lake Suigetsu paleoclimate record (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved					; Shen, Chuan-Chou/JCE-1989-2023; lin, ke/GZM-8300-2022; , Akihiro/AAH-1500-2019	Burr, George/0000-0003-0068-7589; LIN, KE/0000-0003-3675-9054; SHEN, CHUAN-CHOU/0000-0003-2833-2771; , Akihiro/0000-0003-3678-257X; 													0277-3791					NOV	2010	29	23-24					3327	3335		10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.08.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.08.012													WOS:000283699000027

Based on changes in the absolute abundance of benthic Microcystis, the annual life cycle was subdivided into four phenological stages: reinvasion, pelagic growth, sedimentation, and overwintering. Habitat-coupling processes, such as reinvasion of the pelagic zone in spring as well as autumnal sedimentation, were particularly triggered by changes in water temperature. During reinvasion substantial losses of Microcystis were detected. Only a minor part of benthic Microcystis (about 3%) formed the inoculum for pelagic growth. Between 65% and 85% of the benthic Microcystis stock disappeared during the reinvasion phase. Because these colonies were neither detected within the sediments nor in the pelagic inoculum, it was concluded that they were subjected to decay. The occurrence of extracellular MCYSTs in the pelagic zone during this period, which cannot solely originate from the pelagic Microcystis population, supports this conclusion. Dynamics of benthic Microcystis and MCYSTs were characterized by almost identical successions with a decrease during reinvasion, an increase during sedimentation, and remarkable invariability throughout pelagic growth and overwintering. It can be deduced that MCYSTs are preserved within benthic resting stages of Microcystis because they could play a role during overwintering or reinvasion.																			0022-3646					JUN	2005	41	3					479	488		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00071.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00071.x													WOS:000229426700004

Understanding variation in trophic status of lakes on the Boreal Plain: A 20 year retrospective using Landsat TM imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												There is a critical need for spatially and temporally extensive information on the trophic status of lakes to assist in scientifically sound forest management decisions. To meet this need, this study examined the utility of Landsat TM imagery in deriving indicators of trophic status in remote and relatively undisturbed lakes on the Boreal Plain of northern Alberta. Based on data collected during a survey of lakes in 2001, normalized exoatinospheric reflectance values of the red band explained 68, 82, and 47% of the variance in chlorophyll a, turbidity, and Secchi disk depth, respectively. To understand the natural variation in trophic status in the lakes, we applied the linear regression equations to images collected during late summer (i.e., August) for 18 out of 20 years from 1984 to 2003 and performed a two-way analysis of variance to decompose the total variation into space, time, and space x time interaction factors. We found that temporal factors accounted for 10% and spatial factors accounted for 50% of the total variation in trophic status, with a minimum of 10 years and 20 lakes needed to reach stability in the contributions of these factors. This study suggests that regional factors that are external to the lake explained the majority (60%) of the variation in trophic status of the lakes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The ozonolysis of MC-LR in cyanobacterial aerosol at nighttime and its photooxidation during the daytime was observed in an outdoor chamber. The HAAR model simulates the impact of humidity and aerosol compositions on MC-LR decay. In the model, gas-particle partitioning of atmospheric oxidants onto algal aerosol was kinetically treated using the absorption and desorption processes. In the model simulation, the half-life of MC-LR estimated with its ozonolysis rate constant (3 x 10-11cc/molecules/s) is 4.6 h +/- 0.92 at 66 ppb ozone. With the reaction rate constant for MC-LR with OH radicals (6 x 10-7 cc/molecules/s), the estimated half-life of MC-LR during daytime under Florida's typical summer sunlight is 6 minutes, suggesting that the reaction with OH radicals dominates daytime MC-LR decay. Under moderate sunlight with a typical wind speed (9.2 km/h), the dispersion and HAAR models predict that 25% of aerosolized MC-LR undergoes the atmospheric process within 0.92 km from a bloom source in Florida's largest lake, suggesting the critical role of the atmospheric oxidation of MCLR decay.

Thus, they can provide insight into the Quaternary climatic history and their relationship with global climatic changes. The results of the geochemical analysis of the Xiaozhongdian Basin section at the SETP suggest that SiO2 had the highest content of the major elements followed by Al2O3. The order of the abundance of the major elements was generally as follows: SiO2 > Al2O3 > Fe2O3 > CaO > MgO > K2O > TiO2 > Na2O > MnO2. The geochemical proxies, such as chemical index of alteration (CIA), the index of compositional variability (ICV) and (CaO+K2O+Na2O)/Al2O3, indicate the weak chemical weathering and the aridification of the margin of the SETP during the Heinrich events. In addition, the aridification of the SETP during the Heinrich events may be closely related to the cold signals transmitted from the high latitudes of the North Atlantic to the TP, and the effect caused the cooling effect to be very strong on the TP as a result of the upper-level westerly jet stream and then reduced the suction action associated with the SWAM, thus accelerating the drying rate of Xiaozhongdian Basin, which was amplifying the degree of drought in Heinrich events.

Harmful algal blooms in Sodus Bay, Lake Ontario: A comparison of nutrients, marina presence, and cyanobacterial toxins	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are prominent in freshwater systems around the world. Blooms of these organisms can be problematic as they can produce powerful toxins, lead to taste and odor events, and may contribute to hypoxia upon senescence. Sodus Bay, Lake Ontario, has experienced multiple blooms of cyanobacteria since 2010. These blooms were dominated by members of the toxin-producing genera Microcystis and Dolichospermum (Anabaena). water samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 at eight locations around Sodus Bay and analyzed for cyanobacterial abundance and the presence of cyanobacterial toxins. Both hepatotoxic microcystin(s) and neurotoxic anatoxin-a were present in Sodus Bay over the course of the two-year study. Maximum microcystin concentrations of 24.9 mu g/L in 2011 and 17.6 mu g/L in 2012 were seen in the marina of Katlynn Harbor. To determine if marina location affected bloom events, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were measured on a weekly basis at several marina and non-marina sites on the bay. While the bay-wide summer means of total phosphorus exceeded New York State guidelines of 22 mu g P/L each year, no differences were observed in nutrient concentrations among the different sites. This suggests the bay is well mixed relative to the sampling period and that the bloom events were likely responsive to the general elevated nutrient concentrations of the bay.

Tracing the fate of atmospheric nitrate deposited onto a forest ecosystem in Eastern Asia using Δ17O	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The stable isotopic compositions of nitrate in precipitation (wet deposition) and groundwater (spring, lake, and stream water) were determined for the island of Rishiri, Japan, so as to use the O-17 anomalies (Delta O-17) to trace the fate of atmospheric nitrate that had deposited onto the island ecosystem, which is a representative background forest ecosystem for eastern Asia. The deposited nitrate had large O-17 anomalies with Delta O-17 values ranging from +20.8 parts per thousand to +34.5 parts per thousand (n = 32) with +26.2 parts per thousand being the annual average. The maximum Delta O-17 value of + 34.5 parts per thousand, obtained for precipitation on the 23rd to 24th of February 2007, was an extraordinarily large value among values for all samples of precipitation in Rishiri. Most nitrate in the sample might have been produced via NO3 radical in a highly polluted air mass that had been supplied from megacities on the eastern coast of the Asian continent. On the other hand, nitrate in groundwater had small Delta O-17 values ranging from + 0.9 parts per thousand to 3.2 parts per thousand (n = 19), which corresponds to an mixing ratio of atmospheric nitrate to total nitrate of (7.4 +/- 2.6)%. Comparing the inflow and outflow of atmospheric nitrate in groundwater within the island, we estimated that the direct drainage accounts for (8.8 +/- 4.6)% of atmospheric nitrate that has deposited on the island and that the residual portion has undergone biological processing before being exported from the forest ecosystem.

Treatments included three levels of biomass removal (entire aboveground woody biomass, control; control + coarse woody detritus, LS; and LS + forest floor, FF) and two levels of compaction (light compaction on winter skid roads, TRA; heavy simulated compaction with FF, COM). The study was conducted on a Typic Haplorthod and a Haplic Glossudalf of medium site quality (site index(50 years) = 21 and 23 m, respectively) on the Brule State Forest. Twelve years after treatment, the following results were noted: (1) there were no significant differences in aspen height growth among treatments at either site except for lower stocking, height, diameter, and basal area on heavily compacted plots (COM, forest floor removed before compaction) at the clay site; (2) there was considerable genotypic variation in aspen height growth; and (3) recovery of physical properties, as reflected by bulk density, occurred within 12 years of treatment but was not manifested by improved aspen growth. These results suggest that concern over long-term effects of intensified biomass removal and soil compaction should be matched by a concern over protection of the aspen gene pool in the upper Great Lakes region.																			0045-5067					JAN	2005	35	1					221	228		10.1139/X04-147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X04-147													WOS:000227073500023

This article documents GLOFs in Rongdui watershed, Western Himalayas (China), on October 5, 2021. Data records were extracted from multiple resources to thoroughly examine the climatic conditions. These data are from a local meteorological station, the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) thermal bands, pre- and post-flow high-resolution sensing maps, the small baseline subset InSAR time-series technique (SBAS-InSAR), water release, eroded moraine debris, and the topographic change. The released water approximately reached 59.5 x 104 m3, strongly affecting at least 158.6 x 104 m3 of moraine debris to form debris flows. The potential cause of this change is high temperatures in the summer season in 2020 and late September 2021, leading to a glacier lake expansion and the corresponding GLOFs events. Though a large amount of moraine debris was entrained to form debris flows, the majority of it has been deposited in the wide and low-gradient valley floor area. Results from SBAS-InSAR prove that the moraine dam failure and the glacial till exhibit obvious subsidence before GLOFs events. Importantly, a direct correlation between moraine dam displacements and temperatures was observed, which could be further examined for hazard warning in the future. This case study reveals that the characteristic of deposits is finer in midstream and on fan areas than in other locations. The interior porewater pressure is substantial, with slower dissipation downstream than upstream, which may result in a long-runout behavior of debris flows. Lastly, the possibility of long-runout debris flows could increase due to the lag effect of GLOFs after years of high temperatures, highlighting the necessity for extra attention to the potential risks in West- and Trans-Himalayas.					; Lyu, Liqun/KGK-6474-2024	Ma, Chao/0000-0001-8385-0825; 													1435-9529	1435-9537				MAY	2024	83	5							201	10.1007/s10064-024-03706-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-024-03706-w													WOS:001209730200001
J	FISHER, TR; LEAN, DRS				FISHER, TR; LEAN, DRS			INTERPRETATION OF RADIOPHOSPHATE DYNAMICS IN LAKE WATERS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Models of planktonic phosphorus dynamics over the last 30-40 yr depend on the steady-state distribution of isotope for the determination of compartment size. Radiophosphate data for P-deficient lakes in summer have shown a steady-state distribution of 1-15% of P-32 in the filtrate within 0.5-5 h. To explain this, a phosphate back-flux term from the particulate fraction has been widely accepted (phosphate is believed to be released from the internal pools of phosphate consumers and by excretion from herbivores and bacterivores). We show that dialysis of lake water at isotopic steady state provides values for the dissolved [P-32]PO4 compartment up to an order of magnitude lower than those obtained by membrane filtration and gel filtration chromatography. This apparently occurs as a result of minor cell damage during filtration when most of the [P-32]PO4 is in the particulate pool. Consequently, the size of the phosphate pool and the magnitudes of phosphate uptake and back-flux may have been overestimated by up to a factor of 10. Furthermore, the turnover time of the particulate compartment lengthens from approximately 40 min to > 1 d, which is more consistent with models describing P fluxes between functional components of the plankton.																			0706-652X					FEB	1992	49	2					252	258		10.1139/f92-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-029													WOS:A1992HE01600006

We examined effects of fire severity, post-fire climate, and topographic factors on short-term (<5 years) vegetation recovery in mixed-conifer and red fir forests in the Sierra Nevada. We hypothesized that short-term vegetation recovery patterns would be different among patches with varying fire severity, especially between low-moderate and high severity patches, and that post-fire climate would have differing impacts on short-term vegetation recovery in different ecological zones (lower montane forest vs. upper montane forest). 30-meter Landsat time series stacks were used to monitor short-term vegetation recovery following wildfire in mixed-conifer and red fir forest types. Changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) following thirty-five fires (>405 ha) between 1999 and 2006 were examined. According to the modeling results provided by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions including spatial variation coefficients, fire severity, post-fire wet eason precipitation, post-fire January minimum temperature, and topographic factors explain variations in short-term post-fire NDVI values (adjusted R-squared = [0.680, 0.688] for red fir forests; adjusted R-squared = [0.671, 0.678] for mixed-conifer forests). The modeling results indicated that burned mixed-conifer forest was sensitive to post-fire drought, while burned red fir forest, with higher summer soil moisture availability, was sensitive to post-fire temperature. We also found that differences in recovery related to fire severity disappeared more quickly in burned mixed-conifer forest than in burned red fir forest. Future efforts should focus on long-term recovery, including competition between forest and shrub species in previously burned areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to explain the spatial distribution and temporal variation of microcystins (MCs), the intracellular concentrations of MCs (MC-LR, -RR and -YR, L, R and Y are abbreviations of leucine, arginine and tyrosine) were monitored monthly from July 2013 to June 2014. Three MC variants are present simultaneously in Lake Taihu; the MC-LR and -RR variants were dominant (accounting for 40% and 39% of the total), followed by MC-YR (21%). However, MC-YR accounted for a higher proportion in colder months, especially in March. The highest concentrations of intracellular MCs were found in July and October when cyanobacteria cell density also reached the maximum. The average concentrations of MC-LR, -RR and -YR in July were 4.69, 4.23 and 2.01 mu g/L, respectively. In terms of the entire lake, toxin concentrations in northern parts were significantly higher than the eastern part in summer, when MC concentrations were several times higher than the guideline value by WHO throughout much of Lake Taihu. Results from correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that total MCs, including all variants, were strongly and positively correlated with cyanobacteria cell density, water temperature, total phosphorus (TP) and pH, whereas each variant had different correlation coefficients with each of the considered environmental variables. MC-RR showed a stronger relationship with temperature, in contrast to MC-YR and -LR. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) showed a negative relationship with each variant, suggesting that rising DIC concentrations may inhibit cyanobacterial growth and thereby reduce MC production in the future.

Restoration and Lake Management	ALTE DONAU: SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT - AN ECOSYSTEM CASE STUDY OF A SHALLOW URBAN LAKE	Aquatic Ecology Series											At the beginning of the 1990ies Alte Donau was characterized by severe eutrophication problems, leading to a deterioration of water quality. The former macrophyte-dominated state changed by a catastrophic shift to a turbid state dominated by high biomass of filamentuous cyanobacteria, associated with a significant reduction in transparency. A holistic lake management concept was developed to restore macrophyte domination. Integrated restoration plans included internal and external measures. Improvements in the catchment aimed to minimize the input of nutrients from contaminated groundwater, from sewage and from storm waters. Internal measures included aeration, water exchange, chemical flocculation and nitrate oxidation of the sediments (Riplox treatment). The main measures were followed by biomanipulation actions like selective fish stocking, planting of macrophytes and weed management after recovery. Technical measures like the simulation of low water levels to enhance the light supply for the macrophytes in early spring or partially water exchange with water from the nearby impoundment Neue Donau to stabilize the buffer capacity of the system to compensate biogenic calcium precipitation are still in progress. Restoration was successfully. Full recovery of Alte Donau was achieved in 2004, when intense macrophyte growth became apparent, consequently triggering the switch to a clear water phase. Since then Alte Donau is in a macrophyte dominated stable state, characterized by high water quality with low nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations.

J	Mills, MD; Rader, RB; Belk, MC				Mills, MD; Rader, RB; Belk, MC			Complex interactions between native and invasive fish: the simultaneous effects of multiple negative interactions	OECOLOGIA												We suggest that the ultimate outcome of interactions between native species and invasive species ( extinction or coexistence) depends on the number of simultaneous negative interactions ( competition and predation), which depends on relative body sizes of the species. Multiple simultaneous interactions may constrain the ability of native species to trade fitness components (i.e., reduced growth for reduced risk of predation) causing a spiral to extinction. We found evidence for five types of interactions between the adults and juveniles of introduced western mosquitofish ( Gambusia affinis) and the juveniles of native least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis). We added ten large ( 23 - 28 mm) and seven small ( 9 - 13 mm) young-of-the-year (YOY) least chub to replicate enclosures with zero, low, and high densities of mosquitofish in a desert spring ecosystem. Treatments with mosquitofish reduced the average survival of least chub by one-third. No small YOY least chub survived in enclosures with high mosquitofish densities. We also performed two laboratory experiments to determine mortality to predation, aggressiveness, and habitat selection of least chub in the presence of mosquitofish. Mean mortality of least chub due to predation by large mosquitofish was 69.7% over a 3-h trial. Least chub were less aggressive, selected protected habitats (Potamogeton spp.), and were more stationary in the presence of mosquitofish where the dominance hierarchy was large mosquitofish>> large least chub approximate to small mosquitofish>> small least chub. Least chub juveniles appear to be figuratively caught in a vice. Rapid growth to a size refuge could reduce the risk of predation, but the simultaneous effects of competition decreased least chub growth and prolonged the period when juveniles were vulnerable to mosquitofish predation.

A field test of the use of pop-off data storage tags in freshwater fishes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In the present study, pop-off data storage tags (pDST) without any transmitting capabilities were attached to 118 adult salmonids in a 19000km(2) freshwater system (Lake Ontario). The 93cm long cylindrical tags were externally attached to fishes using a backpack-style harness, set to record pressure (dBar approximate to depth in m) and temperature every 70s (and at some key times, every 5s) and programmed to release from the harness and float to the surface after c. 1year. Recapture of the bright-orange tags for data retrieval relied on members of the public finding tags on shore, or on anglers capturing fishes with tags attached and using the contact information displayed on each tag to mail tags to the research team in exchange for a monetary reward. Thirty-seven tags were found and returned from the 118 released (31%), while 26 of the 118 tags (22%) remained scheduled to pop-off in summer 2017. Of the 37 tags returned, 23 were from wild-caught fishes (out of 88 wild-caught and tagged fishes; 26%) and yielded useful data whereas 14 were from hatchery-reared fishes that were opportunistically tagged and appear to have been unable to acclimate to life in the wild and died days to weeks after release. The field study described here thus demonstrated that pDSTs can be a viable option for collecting large amounts of high-resolution depth and temperature data for salmonids in freshwater systems. Technical challenges, limitations and unknowns related to the use of pDSTs with freshwater fishes are discussed. In addition, pDSTs are compared with alternate electronic tagging technologies and assessed for their potential as a more widespread tool in research on freshwater fishes.

J	Hampson, G; Stollhofen, H; Flint, S				Hampson, G; Stollhofen, H; Flint, S			A sequence stratigraphic model for the Lower Coal Measures (Upper Carboniferous) of the Ruhr district, north-west Germany	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Upper Carboniferous Coal Measures strata have been interpreted traditionally in terms of cyclothems bounded by marine flooding surfaces (marine bands) and coal seams. Correlation of such cyclothems in an extensive grid of closely spaced coal exploration boreholes provides a robust stratigraphic framework in which to study the Lower Coal Measures (Namurian C-Westphalian A) of the Ruhr district, north-west Germany. Three distinct types of cyclothem are recognized, based on their bounding surfaces and internal facies architecture. (1) Type 1 cyclothems are bounded by marine bands. Each cyclothem comprises a thick (30-80 m), regionally extensive, coarsening-upward delta front succession of interbedded shales, siltstones and sandstones, which may be deeply incised by a major fluvial sandstone complex. The delta front succession is capped by a thin (<1 m), regionally extensive coal seam and an overlying marine band defining the top of the cyclothem. (2) Type 2 cyclothems are bounded by thick (approximate to 1 m), regionally extensive coal seams with few splits. The basal part of a typical cyclothem comprises a thick (15-50 m), widespread, coarsening-upward delta front or lake infill succession consisting of interbedded shales, siltstones and sandstones. Networks of major (>5 km wide, 20-40 m thick), steep-sided, multistorey fluvial sandstone complexes erode deeply into and, in some cases, through these successions and are overlain by the coal seam defining the cyclothem top. (3) Type 3 cyclothems are bounded by regionally extensive coal seam groups, characterized by numerous seam splits on a local (0.1-10 km) scale. Intervening strata vary in thickness (15-60 m) and are characterized by strong local facies variability. Root-penetrated, aggradational floodplain heteroliths pass laterally into single-storey fluvial channel-fill sandstones and coarsening-upward, shallow lake infill successions of interbedded shales, siltstones and sandstones over distances of several hundred metres to a few kilometres. Narrow (<2 km) but thick (20-50 m) multistorey fluvial sandstone complexes are rare, but occur in a few type 3 cyclothems. Several cyclothems are observed to change character from type 1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3 up the regional palaeoslope. Consequently, we envisage a model in which each cyclothem type represents a different palaeogeographic belt within the same, idealized delta system, subject to the same allogenic and autogenic controls on facies architecture. Type 1 cyclothems are dominated by deltaic shorelines deposited during a falling stage and lowstand of sea level. Type 2 cyclothems represent the coeval lower delta plain, which was deeply eroded by incised valleys that fed the falling stage and lowstand deltas. Type 3 cyclothems comprise mainly upper delta plain deposits in which the allogenic sea-level control was secondary to autogenic controls on facies architecture. The marine bands, widespread coals and coal seam groups that bound these three cyclothem types record abandonment of the delta system during periods of rapid sea-level rise. The model suggests that the extant cyclothem paradigm does not adequately describe the detailed facies architecture of Lower Coal Measures strata. Instead, these architectures may be better understood within a high-resolution stratigraphic framework incorporating sequence stratigraphic key surfaces, integrated with depositional models derived from analogous Pleistocene-Holocene fluvio-deltaic strata.					; Hampson, Gary/C-1488-2009	Flint, Stephen/0000-0002-0558-6261; Hampson, Gary/0000-0003-2047-8469; Stollhofen, Harald/0000-0002-2782-3440													0037-0746					DEC	1999	46	6					1199	1231		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00273.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00273.x													WOS:000085241800014

Environmental and individual correlates of common pochard (Aythya ferina) nesting success	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Common pochard (Aythya ferina) is a harvested diving duck that has experienced a decline in population size over the past 20 years in Europe. This decline has been hypothesized to result from reduced breeding success in strongholds of Central Europe. Thus, assessing factors underlying breeding success is a priority. To evaluate determinants of nesting success, we modelled daily survival probabilities of nests on Grand-Lieu Lake, France. Nest survival rates varied with female age and annually (range, 5% for the worst year in yearling females to 74% for the best year in adult females). The effect of year was entirely absorbed by the onset of laying, computed separately by age, with higher survival rates observed in both adults and in years of early onset of nesting. Nest survival was also positively correlated with clutch size and female body condition. Nest survival was related negatively to numbers of neighbouring nests destroyed. Area of open water, wet meadows and sedge tussocks had a positive influence on nest survival; in contrast, that of willows had a negative influence. Spring temperatures on one hand and cumulative rainfall and water levels on the other were positively and negatively correlated to the annual start of nesting, respectively, although these factors were not retained in the best-approximating models for daily survival probabilities. Nest survival seemed to depend most on female quality, including timing of nesting, and to variables affecting predation risk. Management actions targeting these variables could therefore be the best way to improve nesting success in this species.

Plant samples were maintained at the temperature under study for up to 25 days with regular determination of physiological variables (pigment ratio and photosynthetic and respiratory rates). Physiological responses to temperature did not differ significantly between mosses collected from a normal river site and from a river site with abnormally high temperature due to input from a hot spring. Simple curve-fitting procedures and summary statistics analogous to those used in toxicological research were employed to compare responses as revealed by the different physiological variables. In a second series of experiments, the capacity of F. antipyretica to recover from high-temperature stress was investigated by maintaining samples at 30 degrees C for 2, 4, or 10 days, then transferring the samples to normal conditions (16 degrees C) for 40 days. Physiological variables were again monitored at regular intervals throughout both phases of the experiment. In general, good recovery was observed even after exposure to high temperatures for 10 days. The results of these assays allow quantification of the relationship between a pigment ratio and net photosynthesis rate.

Implications for remote characterization of dark primitive asteroids targeted by sample-return missions	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												We analyse here a wide sample of carbonaceous chondrites from historic falls (e. g. Allende, Cold Bokkeveld, Kainsaz, Leoville, Murchison, Murray, Orgueil and Tagish Lake) and from NASA Antarctic collection. With the analysis of these meteorites we want to get new clues on the role of aqueous alteration in promoting the reflectance spectra diversity evidenced in the most primitive chondrite groups. The selected meteorite specimens are a sample large enough to exemplify how laboratory reflectance spectra of rare groups of carbonaceous chondrites exhibit distinctive features that can be used to remotely characterize the spectra of primitive asteroids. Our spectra cover the full electromagnetic spectrum from 0.2 to 25 mu m by using two spectrometers. First one is an ultraviolet (UV)-near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer that covers the 0.2-2 mu m window, while the second one is an attenuated total reflectance infrared spectrometer covering the 2-25 mu m window. In particular, laboratory analyses in the UV-NIR window allow obtaining absolute reflectance by using standardized measurement procedures. We obtained reflectance spectra of specimens belonging to the CI, CM, CV, CR, CO, CK, CH, R and CB groups of carbonaceous chondrites plus some ungrouped ones, and it allows identifying characteristic features and bands for each class, plus getting clues on the influence of parent body aqueous alteration. These laboratory spectra can be compared with the remote spectra of asteroids, but the effects of terrestrial alteration forming (oxy)hydroxides need to be considered.					; Rivkin, Andrew/B-7744-2016; Alonso-Azcárate, Jacinto/K-4249-2014; Llorca, Jordi/M-8134-2014; Belskaya, Irina/A-7312-2013; Martins, Zita/H-4860-2015; Trigo-Rodriguez, Josep M./L-3870-2014; Madiedo, Jose/AAD-8811-2022; Trigo-Rodríguez, Josep/L-3870-2014; Alonso-Azcarate, Jacinto/K-4249-2014	Madiedo, Jose Maria/0000-0003-0806-5194; Rivkin, Andrew/0000-0002-9939-9976; Llorca, Jordi/0000-0002-7447-9582; Belskaya, Irina/0000-0002-5796-6493; Martins, Zita/0000-0002-5420-1081; Trigo-Rodriguez, Josep M./0000-0001-8417-702X; Dotto, Elisabetta/0000-0002-9335-1656; Alonso-Azcarate, Jacinto/0000-0003-2187-9360													0035-8711	1365-2966				JAN	2014	437	1					227	240		10.1093/mnras/stt1873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1873													WOS:000328373000039

Occurrence of Waterborne Pathogens and Escherichia coli at Offshore Drinking Water Intakes in Lake Ontario	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The occurrence of waterborne pathogens was investigated at three drinking water intakes located about 2 km offshore in Lake Ontario. Water sampling was conducted over 3 years for Campylobacter spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., cultivable enteric viruses, and water quality parameters. All pathogens were detected in the offshore source water for each water treatment plant (WTP1 to WTP3), although at relatively low frequencies and concentrations. Giardia was the most common pathogen, occurring in 36% of water samples from the influent of WTP1 (n = 46), and with a maximum concentration of 0.70 cysts/liter in this influent. Cryptosporidium occurred as frequently as 15% in the WTP2 influent (n = 35), with a maximum concentration of 0.40 oocysts/liter in the WTP1 influent. The human Bacteroidales HF183 DNA marker was most common in the WTP1 influent (19%), and this was the only WTP where the Cryptosporidium hominis genotype was detected. No water quality parameter was predictive of pathogen occurrence across all three WTP influents. Escherichia coli was often below detection when pathogens were detected, and spikes in E. coli concentrations often did not coincide with pathogen occurrence. After summer rain events, river plumes had E. coli concentrations as high as 222 CFU/100 ml in surface waters 2 km offshore, without impacting drinking water intakes below the thermocline on the lake bottom. At times, prechlorination to control mussels at offshore intake cribs compromised the use of E. coli for "raw" water quality assessment, particularly for chlorine-resistant Cryptosporidium. E. coli measured by standard methods did not reliably predict pathogen occurrence at drinking water intakes in offshore ecosystems.

J	Mieleitner, J; Reichert, P				Mieleitner, Johanna; Reichert, Peter			Modelling functional groups of phytoplankton in three lakes of different trophic state	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A recently developed approach to divide phytoplankton into functional groups was implemented in the biogeochemical lake model BELAMO and tested by comparing model results with data from three lakes of different trophic state. The groups are distinguished by different values of specific growth rate (k(gro,ALG)), half-saturation light intensity of primary production (K-I,K-ALG), edibility (k(gro,zoo)), sedimentation velocity (nu(sed)), and half-saturation concentration with respect to phosphate uptake (K-P,K-ALG). After calibration, the occurrence pattern of the functional groups in the three lakes can qualitatively be represented by the model. However, some quantitative and systematic differences between model results and data remain. Furthermore, the division of total phytoplankton into functional groups makes these groups very sensitive to changes in kinetic model parameters. There is a very high sensitivity of each group not only to the parameters characterizing this group, but due to very strong interactions, also to the parameters determining the dynamics of the other groups. In contrast, the sensitivity of total phytoplankton to parameter changes remains at a similar level as in the aggregated model. The resulting high sensitivity of the composition of the phytoplankton community on model parameters indicates a poor predictability of the occurrence of functional groups in these lakes. Strong phosphorus limitation during the summer could be the cause for the better predictability of total phytoplankton concentrations in both, the aggregated and the functional group phytoplankton models.

Geochemical Evolution of Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The Great Salt Lake (GSL) of Utah, USA, is the largest saline lake in North America, and its brines are some of the most concentrated anywhere in the world. The lake occupies a closed basin system whose chemistry reflects solute inputs from the weathering of a diverse suite of rocks in its drainage basin. GSL is the remnant of a much larger lacustrine body, Lake Bonneville, and it has a long history of carbonate deposition. Inflow to the lake is from three major rivers that drain mountain ranges to the east and empty into the southern arm of the lake, from precipitation directly on the lake, and from minor groundwater inflow. Outflow is by evaporation. The greatest solute inputs are from calcium bicarbonate river waters mixed with sodium chloride-type springs and groundwaters. Prior to 1930 the lake concentration inversely tracked lake volume, which reflected climatic variation in the drainage, but since then salt precipitation and re-solution, primarily halite and mirabilite, have periodically modified lake-brine chemistry through density stratification and compositional differentiation. In addition, construction of a railway causeway has restricted circulation, nearly isolating the northern from the southern part of the lake, leading to halite precipitation in the north. These and other conditions have created brine differentiation, mixing, and fractional precipitation of salts as major factors in solute evolution. Pore fluids and diagenetic reactions have been identified as important sources and especially sinks for CaCO3, Mg, and K in the lake, depending on the concentration gradient and clays.																			1380-6165	1573-1421				FEB	2009	15	1-2					95	121		10.1007/s10498-008-9047-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-008-9047-y													WOS:000264831200005

There have been very few attempts to numerically simulate RDC due to the complexity of this process and the need to use powerful computing resources. The article presents the results of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of RDC with periodic external energy pumping, which imitates the diurnal variations in solar radiation in the subglacial layer of lakes in spring. The research is aimed at numerically studying the initial stages in the formation and development of a convective mixed layer (CML). A numerical calculation was carried out for three variants of external energy pumping that differed in intensity. A diurnal acceleration and suppression of RDC due to a change in external pumping was revealed for all three variants. The results of numerical simulations provide estimates of such integral parameters of RDC development as the rate of deepening of the lower boundary of the CML, and the rate of water temperature rise within this layer. It was shown that as the cumulative heating of the CML increases over several days, daily increments in temperature and depth slowed down; that is, the dependence of the integral RDC parameters on external pumping was nonlinear. The LES results on RDC parameters were in good agreement with our observational data.

A series of three elm declines are evident in one core (BLII) at dates of around 5200 BP. (first decline), 4940 BP (minor decline) and 4460 BP (second major decline); at least two declines are present in a shallower-water core (BLIV). Relative, concentration and accumulation rate pollen data are supplemented by information from radiocarbon-dating, loss on ignition and particle size analysis. The multiple coring strategy demonstrates the replication qualities of the general palynological patterns but reveals the dangers of reliance on a single core from lake sites. The data suggest that vegetational and erosional disturbance were features of the elm decline periods. It is not considered feasible here to favour anthropogenic over natural causes for the falls in elm pollen and both may have applied. Examples of multiple (mainly double) elm declines from European mainland sites are provided and it is suggested that closer attention should be given to multiple elm decline events where they are found in pollen diagrams.																			0305-0270					JAN	1991	18	1					71	87		10.2307/2845246	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2845246													WOS:A1991EY73900008

Based on the analysis of AMS 14C dating, loss on ignition, total carbon, total nitrogen, grain size, humification, and pollen data, the environment change was reconstructed focusing on the intervals of the Younger Dryas (YD) event, the 4.2 ka event, and modern time. The pollen record indicates that deciduous broad-leaved trees occupied most parts of the study region and subtropical trees also grew at the lower elevation areas during the deglaciation. The percentages of Quercus (D) reached the highest during the YD, suggesting lowered temperatures than that of the pre-YD. Comparing with modern pollen assemblages, the relative abundance of Tsuga was lower during the 4.2 ka event, suggesting that the temperature were lower than that of the present. Regional comparisons of multiple proxy data in eastern China revealed that the climate was wet in northern China during the YD, which was probably related to the weakening evaporation effect and the strengthening Okhotsk High under low-temperature conditions. During the YD, the climate in the area dominated by the Indian monsoon was relatively dry in the southern part of eastern China. Meanwhile, in the East Asian monsoon-affected region, the climate was relatively wet during the YD in the southern part of eastern China, which was related to the weakening of the East Asian monsoon, El Ni??o conditions, and the West Pacific Subtropical High.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				OCT	2022	305								104747	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.104747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.104747		AUG 2022											WOS:000842591400003

We hypothesized that emergence of holometabolous insects is triggered by water temperature where temperature variations occur, while light is the main stimulus for emergence at site with constant water temperature. We expected that for the emergence of hemimetabolous insects, some additional environmental stimuli might be required. We also expected weather conditions to be more important at sites that lack variations in water temperature. To test our hypotheses we placed six pyramid-type emergence traps at the two sites. Emergent aquatic insects were collected at 8-h intervals over a 13-day period, during peak emergence for most of the target species. Most taxa emerged during the afternoon at both sites. Only Hydropsyche saxonica/instabilis emerged nocturnally. At the site with constant water temperature, emergence of Drusus croaticus was stimulated by length of sunlight period. Emergence of Protonemura auberti was promoted by higher air temperature and humidity of the day before. Brachyptera tristis emerged in higher numbers when humidity and cloudiness were high the preceding day. At site with variable water temperature, an increase in water temperature, with a threshold at 16 degrees C, was a significant factor for the emergence of Hemerodromia unilineata. This study gives new insight into the complexity of relationships between aquatic insect emergence patterns and environmental drivers, and show that light and weather conditions trigger emergence of most insects under constant water temperature conditions, while temperature is a dominant trigger at variable water temperature habitat.

Trace element contaminants associated with historic gold mining in sediments of dams and pans across Benoni, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												As a historic gold mining area, the City of Benoni has numerous water bodies close to major tailings dams and mine dumps. Here we assess spatial patterns in the sediment geochemistry of five dams and four natural pans within a 5-km radius of the core mining area to determine the degree of contamination7 by mining-associated pollutants. XRF analysis was used with a geoaccumulation index to assess the degree of contamination above background levels. Prevailing winds blow from the north and north-west with less dominant winds from the east. Sediment concentrations of As, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn are highly correlated across the region, suggestive of a common source. Except for one pan showing evidence of local industrial pollution, the most contaminated sites are the dams to the west of the mine dumps where concentrations of As, Cu, Pb and Zn increase towards the central mining area, with highest trace metal concentrations in Kleinfontein Dam, adjacent to a reworked mine dump. Sites upwind of the central mining area showed little evidence of mining-related contamination. Trace contaminant concentrations in sediments of these dams are much greater than those found in the nearby Springs-Blesbokspruit wetlands adjacent to more recently active mines. The potential risks to aquatic ecosystems and recreational users of these urban and suburban water bodies from these wind-blown, legacy mining contaminants merit further investigation.

J	Ågren, A; Löfgren, S				Agren, Anneli; Lofgren, Stefan			pH sensitivity of Swedish forest streams related to catchment characteristics and geographical location - Implications for forest bioenergy harvest and ash return	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												There is concern that whole-tree harvesting may acidify soils and surface waters. This study is a first attempt to identify the landscape types within Sweden most sensitive to acidification and potentially in need of protection from excessive biomass harvest or management treatments such as ash application. The pH sensitivity was defined from stream water pH and related to catchment characteristics and stream water acid-base chemistry. At the national level, catchments with till soils and a large proportion of forested wetlands form the most pH sensitive areas. Because of regional variability in acidification history, amount and distribution of quaternary deposits, vegetation cover, etc. pH sensitivity is determined by different landscape elements in different regions. At the regional level, lakes and forests on mineral soils were also identified as sensitive landscape types. Southwestern Sweden, historically the most acidified, is the least pH sensitive due to the high buffering capacity at low pH. In order to develop effective management guidelines across Sweden, it is most critical to better understand streams with the highest pH sensitivity, those within the pH range 5-6.2. The patchy spatial distribution of sensitive landscape types, makes it difficult from an administrative point of view to develop simple guidelines for where e.g. forest slash harvest should be restricted or where ash applications should be recommended.

Measurements of Slavonian Grebes indicated that they may originate from the Icelandic and Norwegian breeding grounds, not from the Baltic area as is suggested in the literature. The mass of the bird after its nutrient reserves have been totally depleted, its ''structural size'', is best predicted by different body measurements in each of the 2 species and in the Great Crested Grebe, even though they are closely related. Total fat mass was best estimated from fresh abdominal fat mass in both species. An average Red-necked Grebe in midwinter is estimated to have enough nutrient reserves to survive 11 days starvation. The diet of both species consisted exclusively of fish, mainly Smelt, followed by Perch and Ruffe. Both species took more, smaller Smelt than expected from the food supply that is present in the habitat. This suggests that swimming speeds of the fish may be important in determining whether grebes can catch them, so that food selection may be determined more by the agility of the bird than by its bill dimensions.					; Piersma, Theunis/D-1871-2012	Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X; 													0006-3657	1944-6705				MAR	1988	35		1				13	24		10.1080/00063658809476975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063658809476975													WOS:A1988M453500003
J	CASE, RAM				CASE, RAM			SIDEROCYTES IN MAMMALIAN BLOOD	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												When citrated blood (man, cat, dog) was stored, siderocytes (erythrocytes with Fe granuels stainable by ferricyanide) appeared in 24 hrs. (5-10%) with simultaneous rise in plasma Fe and bile pigments. At 4[degree]C, siderocytosis was delayed 4 days. Glucose delayed onset of siderocytosis 14 days. Oxygenation produced irregular cyclic rise and fall of siderocytes. CO reduced siderocyte formation. Addition of 500 [gamma] % acetyl phenylhydrazine (APH) produced 20% siderocytosis in 2 hrs with simultaneous loss of 5% of Hb, although APH did not destroy Hb in laked blood. A further addition of 500 [gamma] % APH was without further effect. Following APH, erythrocytes extruded siderotic granules which were ingested by polymorphonucleocytes, and mononucleocytes ingested siderocytes. In a normal [male], 0.1 g. APH/day for 5 days lowered erythrocyte count from 5 million-2.7 million with simultaneous rise of siderocyte count to 11% and urinary sidero-sis which continued 4 days after termination of APH. Siderocytes are considered as effete erythrocytes, in which the siderotic granules are derived from a catabolic fraction of erythrocyte iron which is closely associated with the easily split blood Fe fraction. Siderocyte counts are suggested for the clinical evaluation of hemolytic processes.																			0080-4649						1946	133	872					235	248		10.1098/rspb.1946.0011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1946.0011								20994889					WOS:A1946YB68300001
J	Poikane, S; Kelly, M; Cantonati, M				Poikane, Sandra; Kelly, Martyn; Cantonati, Marco			Benthic algal assessment of ecological status in European lakes and rivers: Challenges and opportunities	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This opinion paper introduces a special series of articles dedicated to freshwater benthic algae and their use in assessment andmonitoring. This special series was inspired by talks presented at the 9th International Congress on the Use of Algae for Monitoring Rivers and Comparable Habitats (Trento, Italy, 2015), the latest of a series of meetings started in 1991. In this paper, we will first provide a brief overview of phytobenthos methods in Europe. Then, we will turn towards the 'dark side' of phytobenthos and describe four particular problems for phytobenthos assessment in the European Union: (1) over-reliance on a single group of algae (mostly diatoms) to the exclusion of other groups; (2) relatively low adoption of benthic algae for ecological assessments in lakes; (3) absence of measures of phytobenthos abundance; (4) approaches used to define boundaries between ecological classes. Following this, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of current phytobenthos assessment methods against 12 criteria for method evaluation addressing four areas: ecological rationale, performance, feasibility of implementation, and use in communication and management. Using these criteria, we identify and discuss three general challenges for those developing new methods for phytobenthos-based assessment: a weak ecological rationale and insufficient consideration of the role of phytobenthos as a diagnostic tool and for communicating ecosystem health beyond a narrow group of specialists. The papers in the special series allow a comparison with the situation and approaches in the USA, present new methods for the assessment of ecological status and acidification, provide tools for an improved management of headwaters and petrifying springs, discuss the utility of phytobenthos for lake assessments, and test the utility of functional measures (such as biofilm phosphorus uptake capacity, PUC).

Nine lacustrine pollen records with well-constrained chronologies and high-resolution data were reviewed to document regional and local patterns of alpine vegetation succession in this region, and to understand the climatic driving forces for these changes. According to the relationship between modern pollen distribution and climate condition in the central Tibetan Plateau, Cyperaceae is a moisture-favored and cold-resistant component in both the vegetation and pollen assemblages in the region, while Artemisia is a drought-tolerant and temperate component. Within an east west transect across contemporary alpine steppe zone and alpine meadow zone of the central Tibetan Plateau, Kobresia (Cyperaceae)-dominated alpine meadow expanded westwards to invade the alpine steppe (dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae), and to replace the Artemisia-rich temperate steppe on a regional scale during the mid-Holocene, probably driven by the enhanced precipitation. Vegetation within a south north transect, covered by alpine steppe and temperate steppe, underwent a turnover in steppe composition from a predominance of Artemisia during the first half of the Holocene to a predominance of Cyperaceae in the latter half on a regional scale, caused by a decline in the temperature. Furthermore, altitudinal vegetation belts in the central Tibetan Plateau shifted downwards in response to cooling climate since the early Holocene. Therefore, monsoonal precipitation and insolation-driven temperature changes may be the key climate driving forces for the Holocene vegetation successions in the central Tibetan Plateau.

The total concentrations of a large suite of elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Gd, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nd, Ni, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sc, Si, Sr, Ta, Ti, U, V, Y, W, Zn and Zr) were determined using spectroscopic techniques (ICP-AES, GF-AAS and ICP-MS). The results are similar to those obtained for the freshwater lakes of the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica, and for the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were performed to identify groups of samples with similar characteristics and to find correlations between the variables. The variability observed within the water samples is closely connected to the sea spray input; hence, it is primarily a consequence of geographical and meteorological factors, such as distance from the ocean and time of year. The trace element levels, in particular those of heavy metals, are very low, suggesting an origin from natural sources rather than from anthropogenic contamination.

Bioaccumulation of metals in tissues of Rutilus rutilus and Perca fluviatilis from lakes with poor ecological status - human health risk assessment	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The aim of this study was to determine the levels of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd in the muscle, liver and gills of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) from three polymictic and eutrophic lakes in poor ecological condition in north-western Poland. Metals in the waters of the lakes, as well as in the muscle, gills and livers of fish, were determined by atomic absorption. Oxygen deficits in summer and high concentrations of Cd and Pb were responsible for the low water quality of the lakes studied. Perch and roach showed a potential to accumulate metals from the water (bioconcentration factor >1). The lowest concentrations of Na, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd were found in the fish muscle. The highest concentrations of Cd and Pb were recorded in the liver of both species. Differences in metal concentration between the species were mainly due to significantly higher levels of Fe, Cu and Zn in the muscle of the roach than in the perch (p < 0.05). A portion of 100 g/day of roach or perch muscle can be a complementary source of elements essential to the human diet, because Dietary Reference Intakes were below 2% for Fe, 5% for Na, Ca and Cu, and 10% for K, Mg and Zn. With regard to Pb and Cd levels, consuming the muscle of these fish from the studied lakes should not pose a health risk (Acceptable Daily Intake less than 1%).

Predicting the density of zooplankton subsidy to a stream with multiple impoundments using water quality parameters	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Damming a stream inserts a lentic system (an impoundment or reservoir) into a lotic system, changing downstream hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. One such ecological effect of damming is to create a resource subsidy of easily captured and consumed zooplankton, which are preyed upon by filter-feeders and visual predators. In this study, we sought to predict the density of lentic zooplankton subsidizing downstream habitats using water quality parameters as an alternative to microscopy. We monitored zooplankton subsidy from 4 polymictic reservoirs over 3 summers and assessed 22 water quality variables for their ability to predict subsidies, ultimately finding that about half (48.3%) of the variation in zooplankton subsidy can be predicted using the water quality variables we assessed. While this level of variation explained is not sufficient to replace traditional microscopy for quantifying zooplankton density, conductivity stood out as an important and potentially useful predictor of zooplankton subsidy, and so might be very useful as a screening tool for identifying lentic-lotic transitions with higher subsidies. We also detected three different water quality regimes (high conductivity, high-colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and a remaining category) during the study, with differences in the density of zooplankton among these water quality regimes, suggesting that the reservoir's water quality does impact downstream zooplankton subsidy.					; Ruhl, Nathan/AAE-5137-2020; Richmond, Courtney/L-1173-2017	Ruggiero, Dominic/0000-0002-9972-9349; Grove, Michael/0000-0002-9634-0864; Ruhl, Nathan/0000-0002-2684-4573; Richmond, Courtney/0000-0002-8699-3589													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2023	85	1							29	10.1007/s00027-022-00931-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-022-00931-x													WOS:000910043700001

Amino acids in freshwater food webs: Assessing their variability among taxa, trophic levels, and systems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Although the amino acid composition of fishes and some marine invertebrates varies among taxa and systems, similar information is lacking for freshwater invertebrates. The objectives were to characterise and compare the amino acid composition among different aquatic species, dietary habits, and environmental conditions. Benthic macroinvertebrates from different functional feeding groups (FFG), bulk zooplankton, biofilm, and fishes representing 12 families (21 genera or species) were collected from temperate lakes in eastern Canada during the summers of 2013 and 2014. Fifteen protein-bound amino acids, including thiols, were measured in whole invertebrates, biofilm, or fish muscle. We hypothesised that the amino acid composition will differ among species and systems. Multiple discriminant analyses revealed significant differences in the amino acid composition among species-based on varying percentages of cysteine (as cysteic acid) and histidine-and among FFG/trophic designations-based on histidine and lysine-where the primary consumers were more variable than the predators. Overall, the results suggest that patterns were based on phylogenetics, biological characteristics, and the FFG/trophic designations of biota. The within-taxon variability in composition was also related to differences among lakes. Characteristics of their environment, including lake pH and the food web structure (abundance and composition of taxa), probably influenced their dietary habits and amino acid composition of diet. These results expand the currently limited knowledge of the biochemical composition of freshwater biota and provide impetus for further studies on nutritional values in predator-prey relationships, trophic guilds, and the biomagnification of protein-bound contaminants through food webs.

In the North China Plain (NCP), explosive growth of fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), which occurs during some HPES, is dominated by a two-way feedback mechanism between more unfavorable meteorological conditions and cumulative aerosol pollution. However, the existence of a two-way feedback mechanism such as this in other key haze regions in China is uncertain; these regions include the Guanzhong Plain (GZP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the Two Lakes Basin (TLB; a large outflow basin connected to Hubei Province and Hunan Province), the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, the Sichuan Basin (SB), and the Northeast China Plain (NeCP). In this study, using surface PM2.5 and radiation observations, radiosonde observations, and reanalysis data, we observed the existence of a two-way feedback mechanism in the six abovementioned regions. In the SB, this two-way feedback mechanism is weak due to the suppression of cloudy mid-upper layers. In the more polluted NCP, the GZP, and the NeCP, the feedback is more striking than that in the YRD, the TLB, and the PRD. In these regions, the feedback of worsened meteorological conditions on PM2.5 explains 60%-70 % of the increase in PM2.5 during the cumulative stages (CSs). For each region, the low-level cooling bias becomes increasingly substantial with increasing aerosol pollution and a closer distance to the ground surface. With PM2.5 mass concentrations greater than 400 mu g m(-3), the near-ground bias exceeded -4 degrees C in Beijing and reached up to approximately -4 degrees C in Xi'an; this result was caused by accumulated aerosol mass to some extent. In addition to the increase in PM2.5 caused by the two-way feedback, these regions also suffer from the regional transport of pollutants, including inter-regional transport in the GZP, trans-regional transport from the NCP to the YRD and the TLB, and south-westerly transport in the NeCP.

Here, we report the assembly of five metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of a novel lineage of Chloroflexales found in mesophilic lithifying microbial mats (microbialites) in Lake Alchichica (Mexico). Genomic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the bins shared 92% of their genes, and these genes were nearly identical despite being assembled from samples collected along a depth gradient (1-15m depth). We tentatively name this lineage Candidatus Lithoflexus mexicanus. Metabolic predictions based on the MAGs suggest that these chlorosome-lacking mixotrophs share features in central carbon metabolism, electron transport, and adaptations to life under oxic and anoxic conditions, with members of two related lineages, Chloroflexineae and Roseiflexineae. Contrasting with the other diverse microbialite community members, which display much lower genomic conservation along the depth gradient, Ca. L. mexicanus MAGs exhibit remarkable similarity. This might reflect a particular flexibility to acclimate to varying light conditions with depth or the capacity to occupy a very specific spatial ecological niche in microbialites from different depths. Alternatively, Ca. L. mexicanus may also have the ability to modulate its gene expression as a function of the local environmental conditions during diel cycles in microbialites along the depth gradient.

OH center dot acts as a strong oxidant within the irradiated water column, and affects the bioavailability, cycling, and mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the speciation and redox state of important trace metals e.g., iron and copper, and the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The generation of this species from irradiated DOM may be especially important in Arctic surface waters during the boreal summer, which contains high levels of DOM and experiences continual solar irradiance. Here, we investigate the OH center dot produced from laser irradiated Arctic DOM isolated from Toolik Lake, AK (68 degrees 38' N, 149 degrees 43' W). We measured the wavelength dependence of OH center dot production for aqueous solutions of DOM and report that the greatest OH center dot production occurs at wavelengths less than 360 nm. OH center dot production rates ranged from 1.7 (+/- 0.1)x10(-7) M h(-1) to 6.4 (+/- 0.2)x10(-7) M h(-1), with the rate depending on both irradiation wavelength and to a lesser degree the method used to isolate the DOM matrix. These findings lead to a better understanding of the potentially important photo-oxidation processes that may impact DOM cycling in the Arctic.

In the Makgadikgadi Basin of northern Botswana, a debate about the formative processes of these landforms has persisted despite numerous morphometric, sedimentary and geochronological analyses, with mound landforms variously inferred to be aeolian dunes, subaqueous dunes, spring mounds or shoreline remnants. We propose a new formative mechanism which draws on the interaction between uneven moisture distribution on the pan surface and mobile aeolian sediments. We use a numerical model (ViSTA), which couples vegetation and aeolian sand transport dynamics, together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of a mound in the Makgadikgadi Basin to investigate the feasibility of this 'sticky mound hypothesis'. We find that under a range of modelled environmental conditions, uneven moisture distribution on the pan surface can lead to the development and stabilization of crescentic aeolian dunes, with these dunes growing upwind from the point of initial deposition, corresponding with the chronological data gained from OSL dating of a mound feature. On removal of this moisture, the modelled dunes erode and dissipate. These findings suggest that the formative mechanism of the mounds could be dependent on the interaction between differential drying of the pan surface and the competence of the aeolian sediment transport system across the pan floor.					; , Sallie/AAE-5889-2020	Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504; Hills, Tiger/0000-0002-6633-1318													0197-9337	1096-9837				DEC	2021	46	15					3078	3095		10.1002/esp.5215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5215		OCT 2021											WOS:000703950700001

Oxygen- and hydrogen-isotope ratios of waters from the Abisko area suggest that in this region the evaporative flux is small and the isotopic composition of most lakes reflects that of the local precipitation. The hydrological setting of the region and sensitivity analysis of isotopic response to changing climatic parameters such as humidity, inflow and evaporation show that the downcore diatom delta O-18(si) record is primarily controlled by changes in the summer isotopic composition of the lake water. The overall 3.5 parts per thousand depletion in delta O-18(si) since the early Holocene is interpreted as an increase in the influence of the Arctic polar continental air mass that carries depleted precipitation. We estimate that this change is associated with a 2.5-4 degreesC cooling that has occurred since the early Holocene. In general, the diatom delta O-18(si) record resembles the average annual air temperature reconstructed for the Greenland ice core GISP2, especially during the past 4000 years, with a pronounced cooling starting at 2000 years BP.					; Bigler, Christian/C-4002-2008	Rosqvist, Gunhild/0000-0002-9195-607X; 													0959-6836						2001	11	4					447	454		10.1191/095968301678302887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968301678302887													WOS:000169351000007

Although acidification in Lumsden and Acid lakes started in the 1930s, rapid acidification only occurred since the 1960s. As lake water pH declined, inferred [Al] greatly increased causing the extirpation of the sport fisheries. In nearby George Lake, acidification started in the 1920s, and inferred lake water pH declined about 0.5 of a pH unit by 1960. The fish community in George Lake survived where the inferred acidification was less severe than Acid and Lumsden lakes. As in previous paleolimnological studies, chrysophytes generally indicate earlier and more marked acidification trajectories when compared with trends inferred from diatoms, probably because the vernal blooming and euplanktonic chrysophytes are tracking spring pH depressions. Although all three lakes have acidified and metal concentrations have increased during this century, our study provides evidence that these lakes, located as far as 60 km away from Sudbury, are showing signs of biological and chemical recovery as a result of recent reductions in SO2 emissions from the Sudbury smelters.

Distribution and Characterization of Actinomycetes in Mangrove Habitats (Red Sea, Egypt) with Special Emphasis on Streptomyces mutabilis M3MT483919	JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Ten sediment samples were gathered from several geographical locations around mangrove habitat, Red Sea coast, Egypt, during summer 2019. Actinobacteria are widespread in most mangrove soil samples. The average actinomycetes counts in sediment samples were ranged from 4 to 15 CFUg also physico-chemical characters for soil samples were determined. Statistical analysis was applied to assess if the geographical location and physico-chemical characters influenced the communities of actinomycetes. A total of 10 actinomycetes were isolated and characterized physiologically and biochemically. The antimicrobial activities of different actinomycetes isolates were assessed. Isolate M3 was chosen as the most promising isolate with broad antagonistic activity against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 19404, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 with inhibition zones ranged from 12.0 +/- 0.9 to 20.0 +/- 1.9 mm. Genotypic characterization of isolate M3 was made using 16S rDNA sequence analysis and identified as Streptomyces mutabilis M3 with accession number MT483919. This strain exhibited anticancer activity against breast cancer cell line (Mcf7), liver cancer cell line (HepG2) and colon cancer cell line (HCT116) and the IC50 values were 324.77, 333.71 and 354.46, respectively. Streptomyces mutabilis M3 MT483919 had high bio-flocculating activity for seawater treatment, and the recovery of the samples ranged between 71.97 and 76.05%. The crude extract of Streptomyces mutabilis MT483919 M3 was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).					; Mohamed Fahmy, Nayer/AHE-6925-2022; Kelany, Mahmoud/AGV-9145-2022	Kelany, Mahmoud/0000-0002-3049-4529; Hamed, Moaz/0000-0002-2608-085X; abdelnaby, hanan/0000-0002-1599-2511; Fahmy, Nayer Mohamed/0000-0002-8277-7715; Abdrabo, Mohamed/0000-0003-1884-3308; 													0973-7510	2581-690X				MAR	2021	15	1					246	261	6766	10.22207/JPAM.15.1.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.22207/JPAM.15.1.19													WOS:000632041100024

Such lakes tend to be transient features whose geochemistry can change markedly over short time periods. They might also vanish completely during eruption episodes or by drainage through the crater wall or floor. These lakes and their effluent streams and springs host taxonomically and metabolically diverse microorganisms belonging in the Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya. In volcanic ecosystems the relation between geosphere and biosphere is particularly tight; microbial community diversity is shaped by the geochemical parameters of the lake, and by the activities of microbes interacting with the water and sediments. Sampling these lakes is often challenging, and few have even been sampled once, especially in a microbiological context. Developments in high-throughput cultivation procedures, single-cell selection techniques, and massive increases in DNA sequencing throughput, should encourage efforts to define which microbes inhabit these features and how they interact with each other and the volcano. The study of microbial communities in volcanic lake systems sheds light on possible origins of life on early Earth, or on extraterrestrial systems. Other potential outcomes include the development of microbial inocula to promote plant growth in altered or degraded soils, bioremediation of contaminated waste or land, and the discovery of enzymes or other proteins with industrial or medical applications.					; Marasco, Ramona/ABF-3088-2021; mapelli, francesca/I-4677-2012; Donachie, Stuart/O-6220-2016; Daffonchio, Daniele/AAF-4922-2019	Donachie, Stuart/0000-0002-8322-6915; Daffonchio, Daniele/0000-0003-0947-925X; Mapelli, Francesca/0000-0002-2928-6538; Marasco, Ramona/0000-0003-4776-7519; Borin, Sara/0000-0001-7479-8199													2364-3277	2364-3285	978-3-642-36833-2; 978-3-642-36832-5				2015							507	522		10.1007/978-3-642-36833-2_23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36833-2_23	10.1007/978-3-642-36833-2												WOS:000474595400024
J	Brown, ML; Sauver, TS				Brown, ML; Sauver, TS			An assessment of yellow perch, Perca flavescens, stocking contributions in eastern South Dakota lakes	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The success and value of yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), stocking programmes are largely unknown because of the difficulties in differentiating between naturally recruited and translocated stocks. To determine stocking contributions of yellow perch, fingerlings and adults were collected from natural rearing ponds in south-eastern South Dakota. Prior to stocking, all fish were marked for 6 h in transfer tanks containing 700 mg L-1 oxytetracycline hydrochloride. Six lakes containing yellow perch populations were supplemented at low, medium and high stocking densities of about 25, 135 or 200 fish ha(-1), respectively. Yellow perch populations were subsequently sampled with experimental gill nets during late summer; two lakes were resampled with additional gears (electric fishing, trap nets and cloverleaf traps). Yellow perch were processed for routine measurements, and saggital otoliths were removed to determine the origin of the fish. Stock contribution estimates determined from gill-net samples for Island (low), Oak (low), Twin (medium) and Wall (high) lakes were approximately 18, 5, 41, and 38%, respectively. Samples from other gears provided stock contributions of 15 and 10% for Cavour Lake and 41% for Diamond Lake (high density stockings). Although these results showed that supplemental stockings were successful, variability in stock contributions among populations indicates a need for further assessment of variables that may influence the stocking success of yellow perch.																			0969-997X					AUG	2002	9	4					225	234		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2002.00299.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2002.00299.x													WOS:000177149600005

Aviation reports from 11 airports were analyzed throughout the period, and no TSSN events were found at four airports. A total of 19 TSSN events were identified, and six events were found in 2015, when the sea-effect snow (SES) mechanisms were observed four times. The majority of TSSN events were of very short duration (0-1 h), and no significant trend was observed in terms of intraday distribution. SES mechanism was observed in 17 of the 19 TSSN events, and the dominance of northern flows was detected at all airports and at the sub-inversion upstream levels. In terms of air-sea interaction, suitable temperature differences between the SS and 850/700 hPa (17 degrees C and 27 degrees C on average), and the transfer of heat-moisture fluxes from the SS to the upper-atmosphere were possible in almost all TSSN events. In this way, meteorological parameters were sufficient for the formation and strengthening of the convective layer. In addition, the presence of directional wind shear and the observation of inversion layers restricting convective movements at higher levels instead of near the surface ensured that the moisture requirement, lifting mechanism, and unstable atmospheric conditions required for the formation of TS were provided. The CAPE values were very low for winter TSs. Total Total Index and TQ Index produced the most appropriate results for TSSN prediction.

Machine Learning Quantifies Fine-Scale Hairiness in Shore Flies (Diptera: Ephydridae)	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY												Morphological analysis of fine structures on small insects is often labor intensive, scale-limited, and biased by sampling or organismal life history. We used a pixel classification machine-learning workflow with the open source programs Ilastik and Fiji to identify and quantify microtrichia in semiaquatic shore flies (Ephydridae). This methodology semi-automates quantification of hairs by counting objects or groups of class-assigned pixels and determining their percent coverage at a given magnification using scanning electron micrographs. Our results are consistent with manual counts, with Paracoenia species that tolerate hot springs having more hairs than less aquatic Parydra. However, Paracoenia hairs tend to be shorter, and the percent coverage of microtrichia per unit surface area did not differentiate species except for the anterior thoracic spiracle. Our workflow is adaptable for use in other taxonomic groups or beyond the quantification of hairs, with the upper limits of applicability determined by overlap in the feature of interest. As molecular datasets continue to grow and proliferate in the multi-omics age, efficient morphological workflows become even more critical to allowing proportionally robust, complementary biological inferences grounded in phenotypic data.																			0362-2525	1097-4687				OCT	2025	286	10							e70096	10.1002/jmor.70096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.70096								41085021					WOS:001593973300001

The vegetation on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is highly sensitive to climatic changes, but studies of long-term changes in the vegetation cover of this region are lacking. To better understand the changes in the regional vegetation cover since late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, we obtained a pollen record from Luanhaizi Lake and used it to quantitatively reconstruct changes in the cover of trees and grasses using the random forest method. The pollen spectra show that the vegetation of the Luanhaizi Lake area was probably alpine tundra from late MIS3 to the Last Glacial Maximum, after which it changed to alpine steppe with alpine shrub and sparse forest at lower elevations during the last deglaciation. Alpine steppe and alpine meadow dominated the vegetation during the Holocene, with sparse forest in the surrounding low-elevation areas. The quantitative vegetation cover reconstruction suggests that the vegetation cover of the Luanhaizi Lake area was low (20-30%) during 47.0-20.0 ka. The tree cover then increased from-3% to-10%, and the grass cover increased from-20% to-45% during the last deglaciation (20.0-11.9 ka). The increasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation caused increases in the regional temperature, meltwater supply, and monsoon precipitation, which promoted the development of steppe vegetation. The continued increases in insolation and monsoonal precipitation during the Holocene further increased the tree cover, which reached a maximum of 17.4% at-7.2 ka. Vegetation cover reconstructions from two other sites on the eastern QTP for the last deglaciation indicate contrasting patterns of changes, likely due to contrasts in elevation, climate, and environment.					; Zhang, Shengrui/P-1390-2019; Zhang, Jun/AAF-6673-2019; Xiang, Lixiong/JWP-9016-2024	Sun, Mingjie/0000-0002-1556-0575; /0000-0002-4471-8511; Xiang, Lixiong/0000-0002-7064-4384; Sun, Yuanhao/0000-0002-3083-4036; Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 15	2023	318								108292	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108292		SEP 2023											WOS:001076309300001

These events resulted in many consumer complaints from the respective communities served. During the San Diego episode, moderate numbers of Pseudanabaena and other plankton were present in the water, and MLB was detected in one sample at 23 ng/l. Two strains of Pseudanabaena that produced MIB were isolated; cultures of this organism yielded 22 and 23 mu g/l, respectively. Lake Skinner water also contained a moderate number of Pseudanabaena and other plankton when MIB levels began to rise, with MIB reaching 10 ng/l. Liquid and agar cultures derived from Lake Skinner water developed a strong MIB odor, and eventually three MIB-producing isolates were obtained. MIB levels in the cultures were all less than 1 mu g/l. This was the first known MIB episode of planktonic origin in Lake Skinner, and it was the first off-flavor event in either reservoir in which Pseudanabaena was implicated. These two events underscore the potential importance of an organism not generally recognized as a cause of off-flavor in water supplies. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

During the time period with the most intensive photochemistry (10:00-16:00 LT), secondary production of HCHO was estimated to account for approximately 69.6 % according to a multi-linear regression method based on ambient measurements of HCHO, acetylene (C2H2), and ozone (O-3). The average secondary HCHO production rate was estimated to be 0.73 ppbv h(-1) during the whole campaign (including daytime and nighttime), with a dominant contribution from reactions between alkenes and OH radicals (66.3 %), followed by OH-radical-initiated reactions with alkanes and aromatics (together 19.0 %), OH-radical-initiated reactions with oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs; 8.7 %), and ozonolysis of alkenes (6.0 %). An overall HCHO loss, including HCHO photolysis, reactions with OH radicals, and dry deposition, was estimated to be 0.49 ppbv h(-1). Calculated net HCHO production rates were in relatively good agreement with the observed rates of HCHO concentration change throughout the sunny days, indicating that HCHO was approximately produced by oxidation of the 24 hydrocarbons we took into account at the DSL site during the campaign, whereas calculated net HCHO production rates prevailed over the observed rates of HCHO concentration change in the morning/midday hours on the cloudy and rainy days, indicating a missing loss term, most likely due to HCHO wet deposition. Our results suggest the important role of secondary pollution in the suburbs of Shanghai, where alkenes are likely key precursors for HCHO.					; Wang, Lin/E-8546-2010; Wu, Shijian/AAV-7385-2021; Yao, Lei/AAJ-5063-2021; wang, Lihong/MGA-7080-2025	Fu, Qingyan/0000-0003-2192-5654; Wang, Lin/0000-0002-4905-3432; Wang, Yuwei/0009-0004-4437-6365; Yao, Lei/0000-0002-2680-1629; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				MAR 7	2023	23	5					2997	3014		10.5194/acp-23-2997-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2997-2023													WOS:000944208300001

Phytoplankton strategies to exploit nutrients in coastal lagoons with different eutrophication status during re-oligotrophication	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We studied a mesotrophic and a hypertrophic Mediterranean coastal lagoon, both of which had been simultaneously subjected to a nutrient input reduction for 9 yr. We compared these 2 lagoons to an oligotrophic coastal lagoon. Using bioassays comprising 24 h incubations with added phosphorus and/or ammonium, we investigated the response of the phytoplankton communities to nutrient enrichment during summer in terms of biomass, size class structure, abundance and growth. For nitrogen and phosphorus, we identified which nutrient limited phytoplankton growth, and what strategies of nutrient exploitation the communities adopted to cope with these limitations. Ultraphytoplankton dominated the 3 communities, but it differed in composition among the lagoons. Green algae dominated in the hypertrophic lagoon, whereas the mesotrophic lagoon presented a higher diversity of phytoplankton groups. Picocyanobacteria and small diatoms were the most abundant groups in the oligotrophic lagoon, although they accounted for less biomass than green algae. The communities of the mesotrophic and the hypertrophic lagoons strongly responded to the nutrient pulse, showing that the re-oligotrophication trajectories of these lagoons were still very vulnerable to occasional eutrophication events. On the other hand, the oligotrophic lagoon marginally responded to the enrichment, indicating its adaptation to nutrient-depleted conditions. We observed a shift along the eutrophication gradient, from a co-limitation by N and P in the oligotrophic and the mesotrophic lagoons to a single and strong N limitation in the hypertrophic lagoon. Each community demonstrated specific use of internal, external or recycled nutrient pools under experimentally induced limitation.					; Guilhaumon, francois/GPX-7180-2022; Malet, Nathalie/C-8034-2013; De Wit, Rutger/KBD-4717-2024	Guilhaumon, Francois/0000-0003-4707-8932; Malet, Nathalie/0000-0003-1922-527X; 													0948-3055	1616-1564					2019	83	2					131	146		10.3354/ame01906	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01906													WOS:000487116100003

A total of 25 obligate freshwater spawning and one catadromous species has been reported. Fishes from Atlantic and Mississippi refugia probably invaded the region from the Great Lakes basin primarily via glacial Lake Barlow-Ojibway, crossing Quebec north of Otish Mountain to the headwaters of the Churchill River system. Additional dispersal routes existed to the north and south. Euryhaline species from an Atlantic refugium first invaded coastal regions during postglacial depression and marine inundation. Remnants of these occur as landlocked populations. Labrador is divided into three major ichthyogeographic regions based on species distributions and dispersal opportunities. The Churchill River forms one region and is divided into three subregions. Upstream of Churchill Falls there is only one species, which dispersed across Quebec. Downstream areas, including accessible tributaries, have all of the common fishes present in Labrador. Less accessible watersheds south of Churchill River from the third subregion and are limited to fishes with better swimming abilities. The second major region is southeastern Labrador which has euryhaline fishes from Atlantic refugia and three species from Quebec. The third major region is loosely defined as northern Labrador (> 55.degree. N) although it is one of decreasing numbers of species with increasing latitude.

Design of a rainfall simulator for classroom demonstration and field research	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Rainfall is a key abiotic factor of ecosystems that can both provide benefits and contribute to negative environmental impacts. Due to spring precipitation levels increasing in the Midwest, there has been increased interest in developing and evaluating practices that can mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall. As this is an area of interest for both agriculture and environmental sciences, demonstrating the actions of severe rainfall can be a powerful tool in the natural sciences classroom as well as in the field. Rainfall simulators are ideal for this demonstration as they can create repeated, uniform rainfall events while introducing limited variability between events. Building on previous literature, we constructed a cost-effective, easily transportable design that can be utilized in the classroom, the lab, and the field. Here, tests were conducted to measure flow rate, rain droplet size, and uniformity of water dispersion on the cost-effective and easily obtained solid cone-style herbicide nozzle. We found no statistically significant differences among rainfall dispersion metrics or in raindrop uniformity analyses. This demonstrates the capability of constructing this type of teaching and research equipment at little cost while producing highly consistent and size-relevant artificial rainfall.																				2639-6696				JUN	2023	6	2							e20383	10.1002/agg2.20383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agg2.20383													WOS:001002265800001

Modelling extreme rain accumulation with an application to the 2011 Lake Champlain flood	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS												A simple strategy is proposed to model total accumulation in non-overlapping clusters of extreme values from a stationary series of daily precipitation. Assuming that each cluster contains at least one value above a high threshold, the cluster sum S is expressed as the ratio S=M/P of the cluster maximum M and a random scaling factor P is an element of (0,1]. The joint distribution for the pair (M,P) is then specified by coupling marginal distributions for M and P with a copula. Although the excess distribution of M is well approximated by a generalized Pareto distribution, it is argued that, conditionally on P<1, a scaled beta distribution may already be sufficiently rich to capture the behaviour of P. An appropriate copula for the pair (M,P) can also be selected by standard rank-based techniques. This approach is used to analyse rainfall data from Burlington, Vermont, and to estimate the return period of the spring 2011 precipitation accumulation which was a key factor in that year's devastating flood in the Richelieu Valley Basin in Quebec, Canada.

J	Shaw, PA; Thomas, DSG				Shaw, PA; Thomas, DSG			The quaternary palaeoenvironmental history of the Kalahari, Southern Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In the absence of closed sites, fossiliferous strata and regional or even local stratigraphic frameworks, Quaternary scenarios for the Kalahari have been developed only in the past 20 years based on deductive geomorphological studies. Landforms studied include palaeo-lakes, caves, pans, dry valleys and spring deposits, all indicative of wetter episodes. Attempts to establish the presence of episodes of aridity from the vast linear dune fields have not been successful, primarily because the function of linear dunes has been misunderstood. A chronological framework for the past 40,000 years has been established, based on a corpus of 239 radiocarbon dates, of which nearly half, using calcrete as the dating medium, require careful interpretation. One of the most important findings is that the entire Kalahari experienced a wetter episode from 16,000-13,000 B.P., followed by a period of lowering water tables and return to the present climatic mean. The Kalahari is thus out of phase with Africa north of the Equator, and with other major sub-tropical deserts. This has implications for global palaeo-climatic modelling, although the phenomenon could be explained by the orbital forcing hypothesis. The recent use of U/Th dating on cave sinters suggests this pattern extends back into earlier glacial/interglacial cycles.

Integrated water quality assessment of open water bodies using empirical equations and remote sensing techniques in Bangweulu Wetland lakes, Zambia	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality assessment is essential for conserving aquatic ecosystems and human consumption. However, monitoring several water quality parameters in open water bodies poses significant challenges, resulting in gaps and limitations. While the Water Quality Index (WQI) integrates various water quality parameters, its spatial application has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. To address these issues, this study was conducted to establish an integrated remote sensing approach for comprehensive monitoring of water quality. Utilising Sentinel 2 data alongside on-site/lab water quality measurements, various relationships were established. The calculated mean WQI from on-site/lab data was 35, while from remotely sensed data was 41. Linear relationships (R2) between WQI and various water quality parameters such as chloride (0.712), sodium (0.705), TDS (0.705), turbidity (0.628), and EC (0.704) were observed. These relationships facilitated the transformation of water quality parameter maps into WQI maps, the WQI maps were then integrated into one WQI map showing the overall water quality status of the Bangweulu Wetland lakes. Both on-site/lab and remote sensing methods indicated that the concentrations of water quality parameters in the Bangweulu Wetland lakes is lower (better) than the local and international recommended limits, with a calculated WQI falling within the 'Good' category. This indicates that the water is fresh, clean, and suitable for various purposes including ecological preservation, agriculture, aquaculture, recreation, industrial use, and human consumption. The findings offer insights into the general status of water quality in open water bodies, identifying hot spots and potential sources of water pollution with implications for future management practices.					; Banda, Kawawa/JXN-6128-2024	Chundu (PhD), Dr. Misheck Lesa/0009-0001-2424-2421; 													0380-1330					NOV	2024	50	6							102451	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102451		DEC 2024											WOS:001372302700001

Sinninghe; Harrison, John; Villanueva, Laura			Impact of Electron Acceptor Availability on Methane-Influenced Microorganisms in an Enrichment Culture Obtained From a Stratified Lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Methanotrophs are of major importance in limiting methane emissions from lakes. They are known to preferably inhabit the oxycline of stratified water columns, often assumed due to an intolerance to atmospheric oxygen concentrations, but little is known on the response of methanotrophs to different oxygen concentrations as well as their preference for different electron acceptors. In this study, we enriched a methanotroph of theMethylobactergenus from the oxycline and the anoxic water column of a stratified lake, which was also present in the oxic water column in the winter. We tested the response of thisMethylobacter-dominated enrichment culture to different electron acceptors, i.e., oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, and humic substances, and found that, in contrast to earlier results with water column incubations, oxygen was the preferred electron acceptor, leading to methane oxidation rates of 45-72 pmol cell(-1)day(-1). Despite the general assumption of methanotrophs preferring microaerobic conditions, methane oxidation was most efficient under high oxygen concentrations (>600 mu M). Low (<30 mu M) oxygen concentrations still supported methane oxidation, but no methane oxidation was observed with trace oxygen concentrations (<9 mu M) or under anoxic conditions. Remarkably, the presence of nitrate stimulated methane oxidation rates under oxic conditions, raising the methane oxidation rates by 50% when compared to oxic incubations with ammonium. Under anoxic conditions, no net methane consumption was observed; however, methanotroph abundances were two to three times higher in incubations with nitrate and sulfate compared to anoxic incubations with ammonium as the nitrogen source. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the absence of a complete denitrification pathway in the dominant methanotrophMethylobacter, but the most abundant methylotrophMethyloteneraseemed capable of denitrification, which can possibly play a role in the enhanced methane oxidation rates under nitrate-rich conditions.

Species-specific responses to white-nose syndrome in the Great Lakes region	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												White-nose syndrome is a fungal disease that is threatening bat populations across North America. The disease primarily affects cave-hibernating bats by depleting fat reserves during hibernation and causing a range of other physiological consequences when immune responses are suppressed. Since it was first detected in 2006, the disease has killed millions of bats and is responsible for extensive local extinctions. To better understand the effects of white-nose syndrome on various bat species, we analyzed summer acoustic survey data collected from 2016 to 2020 at nine US National Parks within the Great Lakes region. We examined the effect that white-nose syndrome, time of the year relative to pup volancy, habitat type, and regional variation (i.e., park) have on the acoustic abundance (i.e., mean call abundance) of six bat species. As expected, little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), both hibernating species, experienced a significant decline in acoustic abundance following white-nose syndrome detection. We observed a significant increase in acoustic abundance as white-nose syndrome progressed for hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), both migratory species that are not impacted by the disease. Contrary to our predictions, we observed an increase in big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus; hibernating) acoustic abundance and a decrease in eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis; migratory) acoustic abundance following the detection of white-nose syndrome. We did not observe any significant changes after the onset of white-nose syndrome in the seasonal patterns of acoustic activity related to pup volancy, suggesting that production or recruitment of young may not be affected by the disease. Our results suggest that white-nose syndrome is affecting the acoustic abundance of certain species; however, these changes may not be a result of reduced reproductive success caused by the disease. In addition, species population dynamics may be indirectly affected by white-nose syndrome as a result of reduced competition or a foraging niche release. We also found that for parks located at higher latitudes, little brown bat and northern long-eared bat were more likely to experience greater declines in acoustic abundance as a result of white-nose syndrome. Our work provides insight into species-specific responses to white-nose syndrome at a regional scale and examines factors that may facilitate resistance or resiliency to the disease.

Functional connectivity network between terrestrial and aquatic habitats by a generalist waterbird, and implications for biovectoring	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Birds are vectors of dispersal of propagules of plants and other organisms including pathogens, as well as nutrients and contaminants. Thus, through their movements they create functional connectivity between habitat patches. Most studies on connectivity provided by animals to date have focused on movements within similar habitat types. However, some waterbirds regularly switch between terrestrial, coastal and freshwater habitats throughout their daily routines. Lesser black-backed gulls that overwinter in Andalusia use different habitat types for roosting and foraging. In order to reveal their potential role in biovectoring among habitats, we created an inter-habitat connectivity network based on GPS tracking data. We applied connectivity measures by considering frequently visited sites as nodes, and flights as links, to determine the strength of connections in the network between habitats, and identify functional units where connections are more likely to happen. We acquired data for 42 tagged individuals (from five breeding colonies), and identified 5676 direct flights that connected 37 nodes. These 37 sites were classified into seven habitat types: reservoirs, natural lakes, ports, coastal marshes, fish ponds, rubbish dumps and ricefields. The Donana ricefields acted as the central node in the network based on centrality measures. Furthermore, during the first half of winter when rice was harvested, ricefields were the most important habitat type in terms of total time spent. Overall, 90% of all direct flights between nodes were between rubbish dumps (for foraging) and roosts in other habitats, thereby connecting terrestrial and various wetland habitats. The strength of connections decreased between nodes as the distance between them increased, and was concentrated within ten independent spatial and functional units, especially between December and February. The pivotal role for ricefields and rubbish dumps in the network, and their high connectivity with aquatic habitats in general, have important implications for biovectoring into their surroundings.

This organism, Picocystis sp, strain ML, accounts for nearly 25% of the primary production during the winter bloom and more than 50% at other times of the year. In incubations, it is heavily grazed by the brine shrimp, Artemia monica. We assessed growth and photosynthetic parameters over broad ranges of irradiance. salinity, and pH and under oxic and anoxic conditions. Picocystis appears to be particularly adapted to low irradiance: we observed an order of magnitude increase in the cellular pigment concentrations, as well as marked increases in cell-specific photosynthetic parameters for cells acclimated to low-growth irradiance. Growth rates of 0.3-1.5 d (1) were observed over a salinity range of 0-260% and a pH range of 4-12, with maximal growth at similar to50 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1), 40%, and pH 6-10. Growth and oxygenic photosynthesis were observed under anoxic conditions at rates comparable to those measured under oxic conditions. The ability of the organism to acclimate and grow under Such a broad range of environmental conditions makes it an important component of the Mono Lake ecosystem and likely contributes to its dominance of the monimolimnion/mixolimnion interface.

The C/N ratio in sediments from Lake Lielais SvA"tiA dagger u, eastern Latvia, was compared with other sediment variables that are used as proxies of past climate and environment. Analysis revealed that although the organic matter (OM) content in late glacial sediments was extremely low, the C/N ratio captured information about OM origin, and fluctuations in the ratio tracked climate oscillations. The C/N ratio was significantly positively correlated with pollen-inferred mean summer temperature. Therefore, C/N ratio was lower under colder conditions, indicating a predominantly phytoplankton origin of OM, and was higher during warmer conditions, when there was more vegetation around the lake. A strong positive correlation between C/N ratio and the paleopigment beta carotene suggested that elevated phytoplankton production resulted from higher nutrient availability that was controlled largely by the input of terrestrial OM to the lake during warmer climate episodes. Thus, C/N ratio was a good indicator of paleoclimate changes, at least for the late glacial period, when generally cold conditions prevailed. This study also demonstrates the power of multi-proxy paleolimnological analyses for investigating past environmental changes in lakes and their watersheds.

Small mammal associations were examined in six plant communities at Ruby Lake using transects of live traps. Small mammal activity was recorded for these six habitats plus an additional three other specialized habitats. A total of 11 species of small mammals were trapped from the six habitat types; from the entire study area 26 species were trapped or observed. Two greasewood shrub habitats and a shadscale-spiny hopsage habitat held the highest number of trapped species, 6, 5, and 7, respectively. The mesic haymeadow and spring habitats, as well as the big sagebrush-antelope bitterbrush habitat held 4 trapped species each. Peromyscus maniculatus and Perognathus maniculatus and Perognathus parvus made up 76% of the total captures and were found in all habitat types except marshlands. Eutamius minimus was found in four of the six habitat types, while Dipodomys ordii, Dipodomys microps, Perognathus parvus, and Microtus montanus were limited to specialized habitats.

A ∼13,000-year paleolimnological record from the Uinta Mountains, Utah, inferred from diatoms and loss-on-ignition analysis	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					24th Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM)	APR 19-22, 2009	Pacific Grove, CA					Paleolimnological research in mountainous regions of the Western United States provide baseline understanding of how these lake systems will respond to ongoing climate change. Fossil diatom assemblage and loss-on-ignition data were investigated from a similar to 13,000-year lake sediment core from the Uinta Mountains, northeastern Utah, USA. Results indicate the presence of three major zones of environmental change: 1) from similar to 12.9-10.9 cal ka, modern lake formation began, temperatures were cool, and water was turbid; 2) from similar to 10.9-3.5 cal ka conditions were warmer-than-present, and the lake stratified during the summer; and 3) beginning approximately 3.5 cal ka, temperatures decreased relative to the previous zone and the lake appears to have become increasingly alkaline. Shifts in diatom taxa relative abundances within the middle zone (ca. 8.2-6.5 and 5.0-3.5 cal ka) are probably caused by precipitation-driven decreases in alkalinity and increases in lake depth. This record reflects evolution of the lake system and suggests that currently rising temperatures will reduce ice cover and enhance lake stratification and internal nutrient cycling. Any future changes in precipitation patterns may also impact lake ecology through shifts in alkalinity and/or depth. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	WICKMAN, FE; ABERG, G				WICKMAN, FE; ABERG, G			VARIATIONS IN THE SR-87/SR-86 RATIO IN LAKE WATERS FROM CENTRAL SWEDEN	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of leak waters from eastern Central Sweden, a region consisting mainly of 1.7-2.0 .times. 109 years old granitoid rocks were reported and discussed. The ratios ranged from 0.722-0.739, and are similar to lake and stream waters in geologically similar areas. The annual variation of the isotope ratio in two small lakes varied in the range of 0.7323-0.7339 and 0.7313-0.735 respectively, except at ice clearing in spring when the ratio of surface water was lowered by a contribution from melting snow. Small lateral differences also exist in Lake Malaren, probably because its complex outline hinders complete mixing of its water. The Sr isotopic ratio variations with respect to bedrock geology suggest that a more important influence on the rations is the mineralogic composition of the Quaternary deposits (mainly till). The great difference between the ratio of rain water (0.709-0.710) and those of rocks in old Precambrian platforms with granitic rocks (0.720 and greater) results in waters (ground, lake and river) with ratios around 0.720-0.740. This means that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is an excellent tool in studies of hydrologic processes, such as mixing of waters and exchange reactions between water and mineral matter.																			0029-1277						1987	18	1					21	32																WOS:A1987H282400002
J	Kim, W; Sheets, B; Paola, C				Kim, Wonsuck; Sheets, Ben A.; Paola, Chris			Steering of experimental channels by lateral basin tilting	BASIN RESEARCH												A major issue in tectonics and sedimentation is the role of cross-stream tectonic tilting in steering channels. The general idea is that channels will be attracted to lateral maxima in subsidence rate. A physical experiment performed in 1999 at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, however, was in conflict with the idea and showed that fluvial channels and resulting stratigraphy can be insensitive to even relatively strong lateral variation in subsidence. Here, we present results from an experiment which uses a simplified relay-ramp geometry with laterally variable uplift and subsidence to test a hypothesis developed from the earlier experiment: Tectonic tilting steers channels only when the ratio of the time scales describing lateral channel mobility to tectonic deformation is sufficiently large. Occupation time by experimental channels and sand fraction in the deposit (a proxy for channel deposition) both increase with subsidence rate indicating strong steering of channels by tectonic forcing. We also found that, due to local incision, uplift lengthened the time scale for lateral channel migration relative to subsidence. Comparing channel mobility at the beginning of the experiment, with no tectonic forcing, to later tectonic stages of the experiment indicates that active tectonics increased the channel time scale. The interplay of channel steering with uplift and subsidence led to cyclic appearance and disappearance of an autogenic lake in the hanging-wall basin. This lake was associated with alternation between channels going around vs. across the adjoining upstream uplifted footwall region. This creation and filling of the lake under constant tectonic forcing (constant fault slip rate) in the hanging wall created subaerial fan-delta parasequences separated by fluvial deposits.

Because surface routing impacts the timing and discharge of meltwater entering the ice sheet through moulins, accurately modeling moulin hydrographs is crucial for correctly coupling surface energy and mass balance models with subglacial hydrology and ice dynamics. Yet surface routing of meltwater on ice sheets remains a poorly understood physical process. We use high-resolution (0.5 m) satellite imagery and a derivative high-resolution (3.0 m) digital elevation model to partition the runoff-contributing area of the Rio Behar catchment, a moderately sized (similar to 63 km(2) ) midelevation (1207-1381 m) IDC in the southwestern Greenland ablation zone, into open meltwater channels (supraglacial streams and rivers) and interfluves (small upland areas draining to surface channels, also called "hillslopes" in terrestrial geomorphology). A simultaneous in situ moulin discharge hydrograph was previously acquired for this catchment in July 2015. By combining the in situ discharge measurements with remote sensing and classic hydrological theory, we determine mean meltwater routing velocities through open channels and interfluves within the catchment. Two traditional terrestrial hydrology surface routing models, the unit hydrograph and rescaled width function, are applied and also compared with a surface routing and lake-filling model. We conclude that (1) surface meltwater is routed by slow interfluve flow (similar to 10(-3)-10(-4) m s(-1) ) and fast open-channel flow (similar to 10(-1) m s(-1) ); (2) the slow interfluve velocities are physically consistent with shallow, unsaturated subsurface porous media flow (similar to 10(-4)-10(-5) m s(-1) ) more than overland sheet flow (similar to 10(-2) m s(-1) ); (3) the open-channel velocities yield mean Manning's roughness coefficient (n) values of similar to 0.03-0.05 averaged across the Rio Behar supraglacial stream-river network; (4) interfluve and open-channel flow travel distances have mean length scales of similar to 10(0)-10(1) m and - 10(3) m, respectively; and (5) seasonal evolution of supraglacial drainage density will alter these length scales and the proportion of interfluves vs. open channels and thus the magnitude and timing of meltwater discharge received at the outlet moulin. This phenomenon may explain seasonal subglacial water pressure variations measured in a borehole similar to 20 km away. In general, we conclude that in addition to fast open-channel transport through supraglacial streams and rivers, slow interfluve processes must also be considered in ice sheet surface meltwater routing models. Interfluves are characterized by slow overland and/or shallow subsurface flow, and it appears that shallow unsaturated porous-media flow occurs even in the bare-ice ablation zone. Together, both interfluves and open channels combine to modulate the timing and discharge of meltwater reaching IDC outlet moulins, prior to further modification by englacial and subglacial processes.

J	Urbanic, G				Urbanic, Gorazd			A Littoral Fauna Index for assessing the impact of lakeshore alterations in Alpine lakes	ECOHYDROLOGY												Lakeshore deterioration is a major threat to the ecological integrity of lakes worldwide. In this study, the relationship between littoral benthic invertebrates and the Lakeshore Modification Index (LMI) was examined. The influence of the taxonomic resolution on littoral benthic invertebrate community response to LMI was assessed using the results of the canonical correspondence analysis and the relationship between the taxa richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the LMI. Benthic invertebrates were sampled in summer between 2006 and 2011 in two natural and two artificial Alpine lakes using a littoral microhabitat type sampling scheme. Ordination analyses show a similar explanation power when the lowest available taxonomic level was used in comparison with the family level. Taxa richness and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index indicate that lakeshore modifications impair littoral biological conditions with a loss of richness and diversity independently of lake type and used taxonomic level. For 64 families, a lakeshore modification indicative value between one and nine were set on the basis of distribution among five lakeshore modification classes. A Littoral Fauna Index (LFI) was then derived by summation of the lakeshore modification indicative values recorded at each site. A validation dataset from natural and artificial lakes confirmed the good relationships between LMI and LFI but revealed some differences in the relationships. The results show that the impacts of lakeshore modifications can be assessed using littoral benthic invertebrate assemblages with a family-level-based LFI, which makes this method cost effective and appropriate for routine monitoring.

J	Dorn, NJ; Mittelbach, GG				Dorn, NJ; Mittelbach, GG			Effects of a native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on the reproductive success and nesting behavior of sunfish (Lepomis spp.)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												While crayfish are traditionally considered fish prey, they are capable of feeding on substrate-bound fish eggs and their introductions have been blamed for the decline in fish populations in Europe and North America. To investigate their potential effects on fish reproductive success we measured the effects of a native crayfish (Orconectes virilis) on the reproductive success of two substrate-nesting sunfish, pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), in replicated pond experiments. Crayfish were observed feeding on eggs in both experiments. Crayfish presence delayed successful reproduction by pumpkinseeds in densely vegetated ponds, resulting in lower young-of-the-year biomass in ponds with crayfish. In the second experiment, with bluegills in less-vegetated ponds, crayfish prevented successful reproduction entirely. However, when we added crayfish-proof exclosures to the crayfish ponds late in the summer, bluegills located the crayfish-free habitat and successfully reproduced inside the exclosures (1 month after first successful reproduction in control ponds). The results of these experiments demonstrate the potential strong negative effects of crayfish on sunfish reproduction and suggest that the spatial distribution of crayfish and other egg predators may influence fish nesting behaviors and habitat choices. Further studies are needed to determine the magnitude of crayfish effects in natural lakes and ponds where sunfish and crayfish co-occur.					; Mittelbach, Gary/A-2470-2013	Dorn, Nathan/0000-0001-5516-0253; 													0706-652X					NOV	2004	61	11					2135	2143		10.1139/F04-158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-158													WOS:000227073300009

The experiment was designed to examine the effects of acidification on the zooplankton and zoobenthos assemblages of Sierran lakes. Treatments consisted of a control (pH 6.3) and pH levels of 5.8, 5.4, 5.3, 5.0 and 4.7; each treatment was run in triplicate. The experiment lasted 35 days. The zooplankton assemblage was sensitive to acidification. Daphnia rosea Sars emend. Richard and Diaptomus signicauda Lilljeborg decreased in abundance below pH 5.5-5.8, and virtually disappeared below pH 5.0. Bosmina longirostris (Muller) and Keratella taurocephala Ahlstrom became more abundant with decreasing pH, although B. longirostris was rare in the pH 4.7 treatment. These species might serve as reliable indicators of early acidification in lakes such as Emerald Lake. The elimination of D. rosea in acidified treatments probably allowed the more acid-tolerant taxa to increase in abundance because interspecific competition was reduced. Even slight acidification can therefore alter the structure of the zooplankton assemblage. In contrast to the zooplankton, there was no evidence that the zoobenthos in the enclosures was affected by acidification.

Dating North America's oldest petroglyphs, Winnemucca Lake subbasin, Nevada	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												On the west side of the Winnemucca Lake subbasin, Nevada, distinctive deeply carved meter-scale petroglyphs are closely spaced, forming panels on boulder-sized surfaces of a partially collapsed tufa mound. The large, complex motifs at this side are formed by deeply carved lines and cupules. A carbonate crust deposited between 10 200 and 9800 calibrated years B.P. (ka) coats petroglyphs at the base of the mound between elevations of 1202 and 1206 m. Petroglyphs above the carbonate crust are carved into a branching form of carbonate that dates to 14.8 ka. Radiocarbon dates on a multiple-layered algal tufa on the east side of the basin, which formed at an elevation of 1205 m, as well as a sediment-core-based total inorganic carbon record for the period 17.0-9.5 ka indicate that water level in the Winnemucca Lake subbasin was constrained by spill over the Emerson Pass Sill (1207 m) for most of the time between 12.9 +/- 0.3 and >= 9.2 ka. These and other data indicate that the lake in the Winnemucca Lake subbasin fell beneath its spill point between 14.8 and 132 ka and also between 11.3 and 10.5 ka (or between 11.5 and 11.1 ka), exposing the base of the collapsed tufa mound to petroglyph carving. The tufa-based C-14 record supports decreased lake levels between 14.8-13.2 ka and 11.3-10.5 ka. Native American artifacts found in the Lahontan Basin date to the latter time interval. This does not rule out the possibility that petroglyph carving occurred between 14.8 and 13.2 ka when Pyramid Lake was relatively shallow and Winnemucca Lake had desiccated.

Wastewater was continuously pumped into the wetland from July 2008 to June 2009 at an average rate of 22 m(3)/h. Neighboring natural wetland with high density of macrophyte was chosen as a comparison site. The removal of TN, TDN, TP, and TDP in the experimental wetlands as a whole was about 79.3,54.5, 4.5, and 3.4 kg, respectively. The decrease of nitrogen concentration was more pronounced in winter (January-March) 2009, representing a respective reduction of 46.4%, 48.0%, and 47.9% in TN, TDN, and NH4-N concentration. Results reveal a higher nutrient removal potential in wetland dominated by Typha orientalis Presl, Zizania latifolia Turcz, and Hemarthria sibirica under high nutrient load. However, areas dominated by Zizania latifolia Turcz. Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn, and Ceratophyllum demersum L. had better purification performance when the above-water-surface macrophytes were harvested frequently. Dissolved oxygen, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential decreased with the increase of the percentage of Zizania latifolia Turcz-dominated macrophytes. High nutrient concentration in the comparison site and net increase of NH4-N in Z1 indicate the possibility of water re-pollution by intense macrophyte decomposition. Furthermore, results suggest that harvesting macrophytes has potential ability in nitrogen, especially ammonium nitrogen removal, and hence could be considered in wetland construction for lake restoration.

AN EXPERIMENTAL ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE A FLY-FREE CORRIDOR THROUGH A BELT OF TSETSE-INFESTED WOODLAND	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												An area 2 miles wide and 4 miles long was treated with a coarse spray of a 4.6% w/v solution of DDT in Shell Diesoline, in an attempt to produce a fly-free corridor through a belt of savannah woodland south of Lake Victoria containing Glossina swvnnertoni. Seven applications of 0.5 gal. per acre per dosage were made at intervals of 2 weeks, so that the treatment covered 2 pupal periods. Fly density had fallen to a very low level by the end of the experiment, and the area remained virtually free of flies for the following 2 months. Since the population was maintained largely by immigrant flies and subject to wide variations, it is concluded that the effect of the applications would be considerably less upon a stable, self-supporting population. The drop spectrum of the ground deposit had a mass median diameter of 0.35 mm. Recovery of insecticide in the area was approximately 60%. Leeward and under sides of obstacles recieved no dose, although in some cases dosages were obtained on apparently leeward sides, probably because of local reversals of wind direction.																			0007-4853	1475-2670					1953	44	3					601	609		10.1017/S0007485300025645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300025645													WOS:A1953XW99700016

PHYTOPLANKTON COMPOSITION AND ECOLOGICAL TOLERANCE OF THE AUTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON IN ATANASOVSKO LAKE (BLACK SEA COASTAL LAGOON, BULGARIA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Atanasovsko Lake is a coastal lagoon used for salt extraction for many years. Its salinity varies within a wide range (from 6.3 to > 72 parts per thousand). Despite these extreme conditions, phytoplankton blooms are often observed. Therefore, our aim was to study the key abiotic drivers and ecological optimum of the picoplankton in a 5-year period (2013-2017). The taxonomic composition, long-term dynamics and abiotic drivers of the autotrophic picoplankton (APP) has been investigated in North Saltern of the coastal lagoon in Atanasovsko Lake. The APP species were identified by using a polyphasic approach based on molecular and phylogenetic analyses of 16S/18S rDNA in combination with cytomorphological and ecological characterization. Picochlorum oklahomense (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) and marine Synechococcus sp. (Synechococcales, Cyanobacteria) were the dominant genotypes within the APP. The relative biovolume of the APP to the total phytoplankton biovolume was strongly variable (from 36 to 99%) as the salinity and temperature were found to be the main abiotic drivers of its dynamics. Salinity between 30-59 parts per thousand and mid-summer temperature above 24 degrees C provide an ecological optimum for the APP development at a relative biovolume of 93%. This is the first record of Picochlorum oklahomense/Synechococcus sp. assemblage within the APP composition of a European coastal lagoon.					; Gecheva, Gana/AAB-9805-2021; Belkinova, Detelina/JCE-1296-2023; Teneva, Ivanka/J-7024-2016; Neykov, Neyko M./L-7958-2017; Naimov, Samir/Z-4258-2019; Teneva, Ivanka/ABE-2995-2021	Gecheva, Gana/0000-0001-5747-255X; Naimov, Samir/0000-0002-8535-3520; Teneva, Ivanka/0000-0002-8516-181X; Neykov, Neyko M./0000-0002-3044-0539; Belkinova, Detelina/0000-0003-0738-4871; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2021	19	2					849	866		10.15666/aeer/1902_849866	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1902_849866													WOS:000637972000003

This paper will present the proposal of three microstructure models for toponymic entries based on the theoretical assumptions of Toponymy and Terminography: one for entries whose input word designate concepts related to hydrographic elements and key concepts of the toponymic set, another for the constitution of entries that have as input word the toponymic phrases and a third remissive. The corpus that served as basis for the formulation of the models was the repertoire of lexical units that designate the name of the geographic elements referring to water, brook, bay, headland, cable, waterfall, channel, cataract, corixao, corixo, stream, estuary, lake, lagoon, spring, dam, creek, stream, creek, river, sanga, ebb and curve. These hydronyms were obtained from the Atlas Toponimico do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul - ATEMS. The proposed microstructures may be an option to subsidize the development of toponymic dictionaries that, in addition to registering proper names with their respective location and causes that motivate their nomination, also contribute to the rescue and social, historical and cultural registration of a region.																			0104-0588	2237-2083				JUL-SEP	2018	26	3					1095	1122		10.17851/2237-2083.26.3.1095-1122	http://dx.doi.org/10.17851/2237-2083.26.3.1095-1122													WOS:000435390400005

Comparisons were made between the response to Aphanizomenon filtrate and to purified saxitoxin (STX). The short-term response pattern to the filtrate included an immediate 30-50% depression of thoracic appendage beat rate and elevation of postabdominal rejection rate followed by slowly decreasing thoracic appendage beat rate and increasing postabdominal rejection rate during the IO-min exposure. Animals recovered to pretreatment activity rates in <5 min. A similar response was observed in STX, except that Daphnia began to recover immediately from the thoracic appendage beat rate inhibition. Animals recovered to similar to 60% of pretreatment activity after 1-2 h in Aphanizomenon filtrate, whereas in STX they returned to pretreatment activity levels after similar to 1 h of exposure to the neurotoxin. Water from a lake with a winter bloom of A. flos-aquae produced the same pattern of thoracic appendage beat rate and postabdominal rejection rate response as seen with the cultured Aphanizomenon. A comparison of responses to STX and the Aphanizomenon filtrate indicates the effect on D. carinata is through chemosensory stimulation rather than neuromotor inhibition.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1995	40	2					263	272		10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0263	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0263													WOS:A1995QZ60800006

Here, we sampled the original sediment columns from 12 positions in the eastern, central, and western areas of the Chaohu Lake, a representative shallow lake in China, and observed phosphate release under three levels of hydraulic disturbances in the laboratory. When the disturbance was weak and sediment on the surface of bottom mud moved individually (the Individual Motion Mode), sediment phosphate release rate was insignificant (0.24 mg/m(2)/day). When the disturbance was medium and only a small percentage (<16%) of surface sediment started to move (the Small Motion Mode), the phosphate release rate sharply increased to 4.81 mg/m(2)/day. When the disturbance was further strengthened and most (>= 16%) of the surface sediment moved (the General Motion Mode), the phosphate release rate was more than doubled (10.23 mg/m(2)/day). With the increase in hydraulic disturbance intensity, the variation range of phosphate release also became wider. Spatial distribution showed that the release rate varies the most in the western area, followed by the eastern and the central areas. By extrapolating the experimental results to the real scale, it was found that the phosphate release fluxes would probably fall within a wide range between 203.43 to 7311.01 kg/day under different levels of hydrodynamic disturbances which considerably affects phosphate release from shallow lakes. This study also has implications for the pollutant management in other shallow lakes.

An isotopic approach to partition evapotranspiration in a mixed deciduous forest	ECOHYDROLOGY												Transpiration (T) is perhaps the largest fluxes of water from the land surface to the atmosphere and is susceptible to changes in climate, land use and vegetation structure. However, predictions of future transpiration fluxes vary widely and are poorly constrained. Stable water isotopes can help expand our understanding of land-atmosphere water fluxes but are limited by a lack of observations and a poor understanding of how the isotopic composition of transpired vapour (delta(T)) varies. Here, we present isotopic data of water vapour, terrestrial water and plant water from a deciduous forest to understand how vegetation affects water budgets and land-atmosphere water fluxes. We measured subdiurnal variations of delta(18)O(T)from three tree species and used water isotopes to partition T from evapotranspiration (ET) to quantify the role of vegetation in the local water cycle. We find that delta(18)O(T)deviated from isotopic steady-state during the day but find no species-specific patterns. The ratio of T to ET varied from 53% to 61% and was generally invariant during the day, indicating that diurnal evaporation and transpiration fluxes respond to similar atmospheric and micrometeorological conditions at this site. Finally, we compared the isotope-inferred ratio of T to ET with results from another ET partitioning approach that uses eddy covariance and sap flux data. We find broad midday agreement between these two partitioning techniques, in particular, the absence of a diurnal cycle, which should encourage future ecohydrological isotope studies. Isotope-inferred estimates of transpiration can inform land surface models and improve our understanding of land-atmosphere water fluxes.

J	Crider, JG				Crider, JG			Oblique slip and the geometry of normal-fault linkage: mechanics and a case study from the Basin and Range in Oregon	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY												Map patterns of normal fault linkages near Summer Lake, Oregon, show a systematic relationship between echelon step-sense, oblique-slip sense, and the position of linking faults. Where the step sense is the same as the sense of oblique slip (e.g. left step and left-oblique slip), the faults are linked in the lower part of their relay ramp. Where the step-sense and slip-sense are opposite (e.g. left-step and right-oblique slip), the faults are linked in the upper part of the ramp. A boundary-element code is used to calculate the stress field around echelon normal faults during oblique slip, and the model results reveal a relationship similar to the field observations. If step sense and oblique-slip sense are the same, there is a greater potential for deformation ahead of the tip of the front fault and in the lower part of the ramp. If step sense and oblique-slip sense are opposite, there is a greater potential for deformation ahead of the tip of the rear fault and in the upper part of the ramp. The field-model comparison confirms that oblique slip modifies the mechanical interaction among fault segments and thus influences fault growth and the geometry of fault linkage.

J	Stewart, JQ; Whiteman, CD; Steenburgh, WJ; Bian, XD				Stewart, JQ; Whiteman, CD; Steenburgh, WJ; Bian, XD			A climatological study of thermally driven wind systems of the US Intermountain West	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												This paper investigates the diurnal evolution of thermally driven. plain-mountain winds, up- and down-valley winds, up- and downslope winds, and land-lake breezes for summer fair weather conditions in four regions of the Intermountain West where dense wind networks have been operated. Because of the diverse topography in these regions, the results are expected to be broadly representative of thermally driven wind climates in the Intermountain West. The regions include the Wasatch Front Valleys of northern Utah, the Snake River Plain of Idaho, the southern Nevada basin and range province, and central Arizona. The analysis examines wind characteristics, including the regularity of the winds and interactions of the four types of thermally driven winds, using meteorological data from the University of Utah's MesoWest network. In general, on fair weather days, winds in all four regions exhibit a consistent direction from day to day at a given hour. A measure of this wind consistency is defined. The nighttime hours exhibit a generally higher consistency than the daytime hours. Lower consistency during the day-night and night-day transition periods reflects day-to-day variations in the timing of wind system reversals. Thermally driven circulations are similar in the four regions, but the Wasatch Front Valleys are influenced by lake breezes from the adjacent Great Salt Lake, the Snake River Plain is influenced by along-plain circulations and localized outflow from the Central Idaho Mountains, and winds in both southern.					; Stewart, Jebb/D-3700-2015	Steenburgh, Jim/0000-0003-1028-4230; 													0003-0007					MAY	2002	83	5					699	+		10.1175/1520-0477(2002)083<0699:ACSOTD>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(2002)083<0699:ACSOTD>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000175755200032

High atomic C/N ratios in the sediment suggest that a large amount of organic matter in the sediments is derived from vascular plants and soil in the catchment. Based on the good agreement between cyclical variations of delta C-13(org) in the sediments and the spring drought index from historical documents, we interpret that the variation of delta C-13(org) in the sediments is an indicator of humidity or precipitation in the study area. Several notable drought periods with heavier delta C-13(org) occurred during AD 490-570, AD 780-990, AD 1360-1450, AD 1590-1670 and the last 150 years. These century-scale drought episodes correspond to solar activity. It suggests that solar forcing plays an important role for the delta C-13(org) variation in the sediments through driving the changes in humidity/vapor pressure deficit. Dinocyst concentration is high during most of the Medieval Warm Period, and low during the European Dark Age and the Little Ice Age. The increase in dinocyst concentration is generally synchronous with decrease of delta N-15 value. The delta N-15 values in the studied lake are most likely influenced by the duration and intensification of lake overturn, which regulates the amount of depleted delta N-15 nutrients (dissolved organic nitrogen and ammonium) and dinoflagellate blooms.

J	Blake, TW; Downing, JA				Blake, Timothy W.; Downing, John A.			Measuring atmospheric nutrient deposition to inland waters: Evaluation of direct methods	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Several methodological problems have been noted in analyses of atmospheric phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) deposition to inland waters. These include the quantification of contamination, rates of dry deposition of nutrients on wet and dry surfaces, and short-range dust contamination. On and around a small lake in an agricultural region, we tested bulk and automated dry- and wet-deposition samplers for the presence of insect and dust contamination and presented procedures to eliminate biases. Local (<= 100 m) dust deposition appeared negligible, so land-based measurements could be extrapolated to water; however, on- and near-shore samplers collected more insect contaminants than off-shore samplers. Insect contamination was large and most significant for estimates of P deposition, but a method to correct for it is proposed. We found that bulk and automated dry- and wet-deposition samplers yielded similar values when contamination was eliminated. Screens for atmospheric deposition samplers were tested and led to lowered insect contamination and similar deposition rates to samplers without them. Bulk sampling can provide acceptable estimates of atmospheric nutrient deposition if contamination is quantified or excluded. A wet surface does not differ significantly from a dry surface for measurement of dry- fall of P. Short-range transport of dust-borne nutrients may be insignificant. Low-cost bulk samplers yielded accurate measurements of atmospheric nutrient deposition.

Mortality of memorable-sized Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus) after photo-releases	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Mortality associated with catch-and-release (C&R) fisheries is typically estimated as a single value associated with fish that are immediately released after capture. However, with the widespread use of smartphones by anglers, memorable or rare fish may be subjected to prolonged handling time for photographs and measurements, resulting in increased air exposure and subsequent increased potential for post-release mortality. In situations of overfishing, large fish become rarer and their memorable status may increase. This may create a depensatory cycle of additional handling and mortality. The combination of mortality from prolonged handling, immediate release, and illegal harvest is a cumulative C&R-related cryptic mortality that may have population-level effects in high-effort sport fisheries. We investigated the potential post-release mortality of memorablesized (average length of 60 cm) bull trout after simulating prolonged handling (involving photographing and measuring) and immediate release in a controlled angling study at a remote Albertan lake during summer. We found that handling time and air exposure of large bull trout subjected to photography and measurement was long (112 s) and associated post-release mortality was high (10 dead / 30 fish; 33 % after 24 h observation). Immediate release mortality was also high (3 dead / 20 fish; 15 %). These levels of mortality, combined with high angler effort, can potentially lead to population-scale declines at C&R fisheries. The complexity and difficulty of population-scale and field-level measurements of cryptic mortality suggest that adaptive management experiments in reductions in angling effort and improved fish handling may be effective in increasing understanding of sustainable angling.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				MAR	2020	223								105458	10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105458													WOS:000509622800014

Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Microcystis aeruginosa was monitored in conjunction with a human-associated fecal marker (Bacteroides fragilis group; g-Bfra), microcystin, and water quality parameters at two beaches to evaluate their potential associations. During the summer of 2010, water samples were collected 32 times from both Euclid and Villa Angela beaches. The phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) and the microcystin-producing (mcyA) gene in M. aeruginosa were quantified with qPCR. PC-IGS and mcyA were detected in 50.0% and 39.1% of samples, respectively, and showed increased occurrences after mid-August. Correlation and regression analyses showed that water temperature was negatively correlated with M. aeruginosa markers and microcystin. The densities of mcyA and the g-Bfra were predicted by nitrate, implicating fecal contamination as contributing to the growth of M. aeruginosa by nitrate loading. Microcystin was correlated with mcyA (r = 0.413, p < 0.01), suggesting toxin-producing M. aeruginosa populations may significantly contribute to microcystin production. Additionally, microcystin was correlated with total phosphorus (r = 0.628, p < 0.001), which was higher at Euclid (p < 0.05), possibly contributing to higher microcystin concentrations at Euclid.

J	STOERMER, EF; THERIOT, E				STOERMER, EF; THERIOT, E			PHYTOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION IN SAGINAW BAY	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phytoplankton cell counts were made on samples taken in Saginaw Bay during each of 11 cruises from April-Nov. 1980. A spring assemblage numerically dominated by diatoms was followed by a brief period of dominance by green algae. Blue-green algae were numerically dominant from July-Oct. when diatoms again became the dominant taxonomic group. Two regions of the bay were recognized based on the results of cluster analysis and principal component analysis of the average phytoplankton assemblage. The inner bay was typified by algal species with a Saginaw River origin and/or species typical of eutrophic waters in the Great Lakes. The outer region was typified in part by species of open Lake Huron. Wild Fowl Bay and the area to the southwest of Oak Point each have unique phytoplankton assemblages and are apparently not well integrated with the rest of the bay. On occasion, stations at or near the eastern side of the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron interface have phytoplankton assemblages similar to inner bay and/or Wild Fowl Bay or Oak Point waters. These findings indicate a possible strong nearshore effect on transport of Saginaw Bay populations to Lake Huron. The nearshore effect modifies the effect of Saginaw River on the phytoplankton of the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system.																			0380-1330						1985	11	2					132	142		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71752-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71752-2													WOS:A1985AHZ9800006

Meteorological and biological monitoring is often too brief, however, to record the magnitudes of past changes in ultraviolet fluxes and their effects. This study presents an analysis of fossil pigments and environmental condi-tions in the oligotrophic Laja Lake in the Chilean Andes over a 60-year period. The age of the sediment core was determined using high-efficiency gamma spectrometry and dated with lead-210 (Pb-210). Analysis of the total and specific fossil pigments from a sediment core utilized a combination of analytical methods, spectrophotometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Environmental variables, such as stratospheric ozone concen-tration, temperature, precipitation, and ultraviolet radiation explained changes in the fossil pigment scytonemin. Results showed that low cloud cover over the high mountain lake predominated, with high ultraviolet radiation and temperature values during summer months. The most abundant group was Bacillariophyceae (diatoms). The highest concentrations of the pigments (canthaxanthin echinenone, myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll zeaxanthin and scytonemin) that represent the cyanobacteria groups were found in the upper part of the core (cm 0-15). The trend analysis further suggested that the influence of environmental features enabled generation of ultraviolet radiation-shielding pigment in the algae communities in the high mountain lake.This study advances under-standing of the interactive effects of climate change, ozone depletion, and ultraviolet radiation on aquatic ecosystems. Fossil pigments proved to be good indicators of lake-ecosystem response to climate/environmental changes, which are necessary for predicting possible effects of future climate change.

J	Gao, Y; Leung, LR; Lu, J; Masato, G				Gao, Yang; Leung, L. Ruby; Lu, Jian; Masato, Giacomo			Persistent cold air outbreaks over North America in a warming climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This study examines future changes of cold air outbreaks (CAOs) using a multi-model ensemble of global climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and high resolution regional climate simulations. Overall, climate models agree on a dip in CAO duration across North America, but the percentage change is consistently smaller from western Canada to the upper mid-western US with historically more frequent CAO. By decomposing the changes of the probability density function of daily surface temperature into changes due to mean warming and changes in standard deviation (std) and skewness/higher order moments, the contributions of each factor to CAO changes are quantified. Results show that CAO changes can be explained largely by the mean warming, but the decrease in temperature std contributes to about 20% reduction of CAO from Alaska to northeastern US and eastern Canada possibly due to the Arctic amplification and weakening of storm track. A thermodynamical modulation of the skewness called the '0 degrees C mode' effect is found to operate prominently along the 0 degrees C isotherm hemispherically and reduce CAO in western and northeastern US with winter snow cover by up to 10%. This effect also produces a manifold increase in CAO events over the Arctic sea ice. An increased frequency in atmospheric blocking also contributes to increases in CAO duration over Alaska and the Arctic region. Regional simulations revealed more contributions of existing snowpack to CAO in the near future over the Rocky Mountain, southwestern US, and Great Lakes areas through surface albedo effects. Overall, the multi-model projections emphasize that cold extremes do not completely disappear in a warming climate. Concomitant with the relatively smaller reduction in CAO events in northwestern US, the top five most extreme CAO events may still occur, and wind chill will continue to have societal impacts in that region.

Pluvial Drainage Patterns and Holocene Desiccation Influenced the Genetic Architecture of Relict Dace, Relictus solitarius (Teleostei: Cyprinidae)	PLOS ONE												Changing drainage patterns have played a significant role in the evolution of western North American aquatic taxa. Relict dace, Relictus solitarius, is a Great Basin endemic cyprinid with a native range that is restricted to four valleys in eastern Nevada. Relictus solitarius now occupies spring systems that are the remnants of Pleistocene-era pluvial lakes, although it may have occurred in the area for much longer. Here we use mitochondrial DNA sequence data to assess range-wide genetic diversity of R. solitarius, and to estimate divergence times to determine whether pluvial drainages played an important role in shaping intraspecific genetic diversity. Genetic diversification within R. solitarius began during the early to mid-Pleistocene, separating populations within two sets of valleys (Butte/Ruby and Goshute/Steptoe). Additional diversification in each of the two sets of valleys occurred more recently, in the mid-to late-Pleistocene. Holocene desiccation has further isolated populations, and each population sampled contains unique mtDNA haplotypes. Pluvial drainage patterns did contribute to the genetic structure observed within R. solitarius, but most of the intraspecific diversification does not appear to be associated with the Last Glacial Maximum. Holocene desiccation has also contributed to the observed genetic structure. The relict dace populations we sampled are all unique, and we recommend that future management efforts should strive to preserve as much of the genetic diversity as possible.

The unit consists of two main facies associations, asymmetrically distributed: (1) calcrete-palustrine-laminar crust; (2) microbialites. The first accumulated carbonate formed in the distal zone of alluvial fans (calcretes) and in shallow lakes subjected to periodic exposure (palustrine facies) that occupied the westernmost strip of the basin. The second association formed in permanent lakes (stromatolites: oncoids and planar stromatolites) located in the central areas of the basin, fed by springs associated with a concentration of vertical faults in the eastern area of the basin (travertine facies). At time of deposition, these facies communicated with the lake via a transitional lacustrine-travertine environment (transitional travertine-stromatolite facies). All facies show a restricted range of delta O-18 values around - 5.8 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, suggesting formation from paleoprecipitation largely of Atlantic derivation, brought about by westerly winds. As for the delta C-13 values, these show a wide range (- 6.4 to 11.7 parts per thousand), overall relatively high values for all facies, with the lower values corresponding to the calcrete-palustrine association and the higher ones linked to the microbialite facies. The trend in travertines probably mimics an increasing influence of carbon derived from dissolution of carbonate bedrock of the Cretaceous substrate, while that of palustrine samples records increasing respired-C contribution. The sedimentological and isotopic characteristics of the Borj Edouane Unit reflect wetter conditions at the time of deposition, and point to a humid period at the Middle-Late Pleistocene transition.					; Ghannem, Naoufel/S-8420-2018; Armenteros, Ildefonso/K-9983-2014; Recio, Clemente/I-2637-2015	Armenteros, Ildefonso/0000-0003-2570-3450; Ghannem, Naoufel/0000-0003-2262-9566; Recio, Clemente/0000-0002-2424-7249													1437-3254	1437-3262				FEB	2020	109	1					221	238		10.1007/s00531-019-01798-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-019-01798-4		DEC 2019											WOS:000501124500002

Its erosion and movement has a significant impact on the soil environment. Moreover, cohesive sediment is an important part of the sediment of lakes and oceans, -moreover, its movement and transportation also have a crucial influence over dispersion of pollutants in water. Open channel flume experiments were carried out to study the characteristics of cohesive sediment movement; simultaneously the velocity and sediment concentration vertical profile was investigated. The experimental results indicate that under the conditions of suitable hydrodynamic velocity and sediment concentration, a special-shaped sediment flow, stratified movement, takes place in the flume. Its formation and features are closely related to fluid parameters and sediment concentration. Its velocity distribution shows a V-shaped pattern falling forward. At the corner of V, the maximum velocity is vertically located in the middle of the flume. The concentration distribution is vertically stratified into three discrete layers on whose interfaces the concentrations change suddenly. To form lamination movement, different hydrodynamic conditions are required under different sediment concentrations. When the concentration increases, the corresponding flow intensity also -rises up.					he, shan/JUV-4092-2023																978-7-5509-0399-9				2015							410	416																WOS:000391415000059

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contaminants in Black-lip (Pearl) Oyster Pinctada margaritifera from Kish Island (Persian Gulf)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Twenty-four Black-lip Oysters (Pinctada margaritifera) were collected in summer (July) 2004 from six coastal locations in Kish Island (Persian Gulf) and were analyzed at the analytical laboratory of Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research at the University of Windsor according to the chemical analysis procedures which has been accredited by the Canadian Association for Environmental Analysis Laboratories (CAEAL). In order to obtain information on bioavailability of sixteen EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), concentration of 2 to 6-ring PAHs was determined for all samples with application of a gas chromatograph with a mass selective detector. Oysters from Big Coral site exhibited a wide range of total PAH concentration (1.07 to 77.66 ng/g wet weight). The lowest value (oysters from Foreigner's Pelage) and highest values were 0.7 and 36.33 ng/g wet weight respectively. Comparison of the PAH concentrations in oysters with sediments collected from the same locations showed that the overall bioaccumulation has been performed through the movement of water-soluble lower molecular weight (LMW) PAHs to the oysters in the studied area.

The model is based upon the one-dimensional reservoir simulation model DYRESM, and is extended into two dimensions using a Lagrangian formulation of self-contained parcels within the layer structure of the one-dimensional model. These parcels resolve the horizontal motions and gradients by moving vertically or horizontally and splitting and combining to simulate the various physical processes in the reservoir occurring in response to the prevailing climatological conditions. The model is not a full two-dimensional model, because not all horizontal processes are included. Algorithms to simulate inflow, selective withdrawal, and adjustment of horizontal density gradients are included, however, and the model is therefore quite useful for examining some simple scenarios in which these processes are dominant. The results of simulations of Canning Reservoir in Western Australia showing several inflow and intrusion events at different times of the year, and the return of the reservoir temperature field to a one-dimensional structure after the cessation of inflow, are presented. These results are compared with measurements taken in the field, with good agreement. The usefulness of the model in its present form for following the path and estimating the detention time of various parcels of water is discussed.

J	Rius, D; Vannière, B; Galop, D; Richard, H				Rius, Damien; Vanniere, Boris; Galop, Didier; Richard, Herve			Holocene fire regime changes from multiple-site sedimentary charcoal analyses in the Lourdes basin (Pyrenees, France)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												One lake and three peat bogs from the Lourdes glacial basin (France) were used for macrocharcoal analyses and fire frequency reconstruction over the entire Holocene (11700 years). The chronology was based upon thirty-three 14C AMS dates. Comparison of the distribution of both CHarcoal Accumulation Rate (CHAR) and fire return intervals showed that charcoal accumulation significantly differs between the lake and the peat bogs, but that frequency calculation overcomes the disparity between these site types. A composite frequency was built from the four individual records to assess regional versus local variability and fire regime controls by comparisons with regional fire activity, Holocene climatic oscillations and vegetation history. The millennial variability can be depicted as follows: relatively high frequency between 8000 and 5000 cal a BP (up to 5 fires/500 yrs), relatively low frequency between 5000 and 3000 cal a BP (down to 0 fires/500 yrs), and an increase between 3000 and 500 cal a BP (up to 4 fires/500 yrs). From 8000 to 5000 cal a BP, fire frequency displays strong synchrony between sites and appears to be mostly driven by increased summer temperature characterizing the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). On the contrary, during the last 3000 years fire frequency was heterogeneous between sites and most probably human-driven. However, higher frequency at the millennial scale during the mid-Holocene strongly suggests that the perception of human-driven fire regime depends on the strength of natural controls.

Chronologic control is provided by two well-known tephras, Glacier Peak (11200 yr B.P) and Mazama (6800 yr B.P). The presence of Glacier Peak tephra above the basal inorganic sediments indicates deglaciation prior to 11200 yr B.P. Colonizing vegetation (Zone I) after the fall of Glacier Peak tephra was dominated by Artemisia (sage) and Alnus (alder). The presence of Abies needles, Picea needles, and one Taxus needle in the core demonstrates that these taxa were at Rock Lake at the time Zone II sediments were deposited. The increase in Pinus, Picea, and Abies pollen in Zone II (10850-4750 yr B.P) suggests warmer and drier conditions prevailed, and may record the Hypsithermal. The pervasiveness of Picea and Abies pollen in Pollen Zone III (4750-3350 yr B.P) suggests the emergence of the modern subalpine forest. Pollen Zone IV (3350 yr B.P.-present) is characterized by relatively little change in the pollen assemblages. One noted change, however, is the increase of Cyperaceae (sedge), which may indicate an expansion of shore-line around the lake, possibly reflecting increased precipitation.																			0921-2728					NOV	1995	14	3					269	279		10.1007/BF00682428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00682428													WOS:A1995TD95100005

Seasonal euxinia in a coastal basin: Impact on sedimentary molybdenum enrichments and isotope signatures	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Eutrophication and global warming are leading to increased deoxygenation of coastal waters worldwide. To predict future trajectories of oxygen loss, insight into the intensity and temporal dynamics of past coastal deoxygenation is essential. Here, we assess the use of sedimentary molybdenum (Mo) enrichments and isotopic signatures (delta Mo-98) as redox proxies in sediments of a seasonally euxinic coastal basin (Scharendijke, Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands). Strong drawdown of dissolved Mo (from similar to 100 to similar to 60 nmol L-1) was observed in the euxinic bottom waters from July to September in 2021, coinciding with sedimentary enrichment of Mo (with peak values up to 19 ppm). A mass balance for Mo indicates that both deposition of Mo in the form of particles and diffusion of dissolved Mo into the sediment account for this Mo enrichment. The delta Mo-98 composition of suspended matter in the euxinic waters (0.30 to -1.95 parts per thousand) is in line with isotopic fractionation during formation of thiomolybdates, and removal of Mo by sulfur- and/or iron-rich particles. The delta Mo-98 composition of the bottom water increases from 2.42 to 3.16 parts per thousand throughout the euxinic period, thereby further supporting preferential uptake of light Mo isotopes during sulfidation in the water column and near the sediment-water interface. The exceptionally high sedimentation rate at this site (>13 cm yr(-1)) allows seasonal variations in sedimentary enrichments to be preserved in the sedimentary record. Notably, sediment delta Mo-98 values peak during the summer euxinic period, reaching 1.28 parts per thousand in 2021 and as high as 2.15 parts per thousand in 2020. The 2020 value is close to the mean ocean value of 2.3 parts per thousand, implying that sediments overlain by seasonally and permanently euxinic bottom waters can record the same isotopic signatures for Mo. Further work is needed to determine the potential role of diagenesis in altering delta Mo-98 records on time scales of months to several years.

However, long-term variability history of hydrology and ecology of these lakes, as well as the driving mechanism, is still poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the hydrological and ecological variation of these paleolakes since the past similar to 1.68 Ma based on the interpretation of multi-geochemical proxies of the organic matter including TOC and TN concentrations, C/N ratios, and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. The results show that the lakes in the Hetao Basin are dominated by relative low lake level, deteriorated aquatic plant abundances and low phytoplankton productivity during the intervals similar to 1.47 to similar to 1.30 and similar to 1.17 to similar to 1.07 Ma, and similar to 0.68 to similar to 0.60 Ma, while relative high lake level with flourishing aquatic ecosystem and high aquatic productivity occurred from similar to 0.47 Ma to the last interglacial. Meanwhile, tectonically-driven relative height of the basin outlet, preventing the Yellow River water outflows the basin to widen the Yellow River channel in the basin, may be the key factor resulting in the significant rising of the water level of the paleolake formed within the Hetao Basin from similar to 0.47 Ma to the last interglacial.

Fine-scale genetic diversity and landscape-scale genetic structuring in three foundational bulrush species: implications for wetland revegetation	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The appropriate sourcing of seeds for restoration is critical for establishing foundational plant species that support ecosystem functions and services. Genetic analyses of such species can yield insights into patterns of genetic diversity and structuring to inform seed collections. Here we document, for three foundational bulrush species, distinct genetic patterns to guide restoration of wetlands along the iconic Great Salt Lake, the largest lake in western North America. Specifically, Schoenoplectus acutus and Schoenoplectus americanus had moderate levels of site-scale genet richness and relatively low genet richness levels within 1-m(2) plots. These patterns contrast with Bolboschoenus maritimus, which had higher levels of site- and plot-level genet richness, and has therefore likely experienced more recent seedling establishment. At the landscape scale, we found some evidence for genetic isolation of individuals at more remote sites (namely Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge in the West Desert of Utah), but all species are relatively well dispersed over hundreds of kilometers, a pattern most likely to occur via avian dispersal. In our mechanistic dispersal assessment, we found abundant bulrush seeds present in waterfowl gizzards and those seeds germinated readily despite (or because of) partial digestion. Migratory waterfowl likely facilitate the broad dispersal of all species and may aid in bulrush establishment by breaking seed dormancy. These findings suggest that seeds for restoration should be collected within and among seed source sites to ensure a diverse restoration seed lot that does not disrupt gene flow patterns.

J	Wilf, P				Wilf, P			Late Paleocene-early Eocene climate changes in southwestern Wyoming: Paleobotanical analysis	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The warmest global temperatures of the Cenozoic Era occurred in early Eocene time, following a warming trend that started in late Paleocene time, The greater Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming is one of the best areas in the Rocky Mountains for paleobotanical investigation of the Paleocene-Eocene climatic transition. Intensive sampling has resulted in the recovery of an estimated 189 species of plant macrofossils from the Tiffanian, Clarkforkian, Wasatchian, and Bridgerian land mammal "ages." The leaf morphologies and taxonomic affinities of these fossils were used in combination with other indicators to evaluate Paleocene-Eocene climates, Following cool humid conditions in the Tiffanian, the Clarkforkian was humid and subtropical, and several plant families with modern tropical affinities appeared. However, as in the Tiffanian, Clarkforkian floras had low diversity and were dominated by a single species in the birch family, Mean annual temperature (MAT) rose from an estimated 12 degrees C in the Tiffanian to 19 degrees C in the Clarkforkian, while mean annual precipitation (MAP) for the Tiffanian and Clarkforkian is estimated to have been 130-150 cm, Little fossil plant material is preserved from the latest Clarkforkian or the earliest Wasatchian, which is thought to have contained an interval of cooling and drying followed by renewed warming, By the middle Wasatchian, the time of the Cenozoic thermal maximum, the inferred MAT was about 21 degrees C, and the MAP was near 1-10 cm, A second influx of plant families with tropical affinities appeared in the area, and diversity increased significantly, but most plant families known from the Clarkforkian persisted. Species turnover from the Clarkforkian to the Wasatchian was greater than 80%. A second turnover of more than 80% of species (but not families) from the Wasatchian to the early Bridgerian accompanied drying and increased seasonality of precipitation. The early Bridgerian MAT is inferred to have been near 20 degrees C and the MAP to have been about 80 cm, Except for the Tiffanian and possibly portions of the early Wasatchian, paleoclimates during the study interval were predominantly frost free. Although the moderating influence of the Green River lake system has been suggested as a possible explanation for mild Eocene winters in Wyoming, this study shows that virtually frost-free climates existed in the area prior to and independent of significant lake development.

The territorial behaviour of Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus L.) and S. isodon Turov was evaluated basing on live trapping of marked animals in experimental enclosures. The distribution of common shrew depends on the biomass of soil and terrestrial invertebrates (r = 0,97). Correlation between the number of shrews (y) and the biomass of invertebrates (x) is reflected by the equation y = 0.97x - 0.05. The territorial behaviour of overnintered females varies depending on their age and reproductive activity. The activity of breeding females is more restricted. The size of their home ranges reached its maximum value (up to 1600 m, average 1300 m). After the end of reproductive period, the females begin to move and the structure of home ranges disappears. Overwintered males are more mobile in summer and their home ranges are somewhat larger. Home ranges of juveniles (youngs of the year) significantly overlaps. Their mean area varies between 360 and 500 m. At the same time, some youngs have no home ranges. S. isodon are more mobile as compared with common shrews. However, they have home ranges as well.

The three treatments: + zooplanktivorous fish (39 bluegill, mean total length = 36 mm); + zooplankton (10x ambient); and + N + P (160 mu M NH4+ and 10.0 mu M PO43-) were duplicated and compared to ambient pond conditions and two control mesocosms. In the + N + P treatment, chl a concentrations increased 700% in four days and then decreased to initial levels; further nutrient enrichments failed to create an algal response, probably because of grazing associated with an eightfold increase in large cladocerans. After nutrients were added to the + fish treatment, the NH4+ and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations rose and then decreased rapidly, whereas chi a concentrations and rotifer numbers increased. When nutrients were added to the + zooplankton treatments, chi a increased, but less than when either fish or nutrients alone yrere added. In small eutrophic ponds, trophic manipulations may have little effect during equilibrium conditions but do alter algal responses during nutrient pulses. An increase in large cladocerans in response to a nutrient pulse may control nuisance algal blooms, even with subsequent nutrient additions.
