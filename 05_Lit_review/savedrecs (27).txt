J	Pla, S; Monteith, D; Flower, R; Rose, N				Pla, Sergi; Monteith, Don; Flower, Roger; Rose, Neil			The recent palaeolimnology of a remote Scottish loch with special reference to the relative impacts of regional warming and atmospheric contamination	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. High-resolution palaeolimnological multiproxy data were obtained from an unacidified remote Scottish loch, Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR). The sediment record of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) was used to define the onset of low-level atmospheric industrial contamination (c. 1830 AD) and discriminate between "pre-industrial" and "industrial" eras. 2. The diatom and chrysophyte cyst fossil assemblages indicated that LCFR was ecologically stable at a decadal to centennial scale prior to the 19th century. However, the species composition of both proxies changed progressively over the last 200 years. Diatom species shifts were taxonomically consistent with those reported for other remote oligotrophic lakes where regional climate warming has been proposed as the dominant driver. 3. We examined the character of species variation across the full core record and within pre-industrial and industrial periods in isolation to test competing hypotheses of climate (air temperature) and air pollution as drivers of biological change in this remote lake. We also applied SCP flux and Central England Temperature Series (CET) data as potential explanatory variables of species variation. 4. Marked decadal- to centennial-scale variability in climate is not unique to the industrial era. We hypothesised, therefore, that if climate change was the principal driver of species change in LCFR, the species diagnostic of change should provide evidence of similar counter-variation in the pre-industrial section of the core. Alternatively, were anthropogenic atmospheric contamination of primary importance, then the species dominating variation in the pre-industrial and industrial sections should differ markedly. 5. The principal component of variation in both proxies was significantly correlated with a range of CET variables. However, SCP flux was a far stronger predictor of change in diatom composition and CET variables did not account significantly for any residual variation. In contrast, while SCP flux was also the strongest individual predictor of change in chrysophyte cyst composition, CET variables remained significant when SCP flux was held covariable. 6. Species dominating the principal component of variation in diatoms in the pre-industrial period were unrelated to those dominating the principal change in the flora, but were closely related to the second component in the full core. Similarity between the second component and diatom inferred pH and DOC, therefore, indicated tentatively that pre-industrial variation in species was dominated by hydrologically driven variation and that this influence had persisted as the sub-dominant mode to the present. 7. While the overall trajectories of community change in the two assemblages were similar, changes in diatom community (largely benthic) could be linked only to the effects of atmospheric deposition, possibly through effects of nitrogen enrichment. However, shifts in the chrysophyte community (largely planktonic) were most likely explained by an interaction between atmospheric pollutants and warming. We conclude that, although the two proxies exhibit broadly similar patterns of long term change, only change in the planktonic proxy can be linked to climate change, and even here chemical contamination from the atmosphere is likely to have dominated the biological response.

The appearance of the water is, however, influenced by a number of physical and biological factors such as the frequency of storms, the hydrological balance, the water level and the growth of algae. Here we report the results of a survey designed to test the reaction of the local population to these seasonal and inter-annual variations. This survey was based on a questionnaire completed by 960 permanent inhabitants of the shoreline villages and was designed to explore their awareness of the local and regional factors responsible for the changes. About one-quarter of the respondents considered that the drying effects of global climate change had already had an effect on the Lake Balaton area. Although younger (16-26) and middle-aged (27-50) respondents benefit most from good water quality, those in the oldest age group (51-92) were more concerned about the quality of the water and broader issues such as biodiversity and the conservation of the landscape. Considering that the future of the lake depends on the youngest generation, this suggests that their environmental education could be improved to strengthen their understanding of environmental issues.

J	BENSON, LV; THOMPSON, RS				BENSON, LV; THOMPSON, RS			LAKE-LEVEL VARIATION IN THE LAHONTAN BASIN FOR THE PAST 50,000 YEARS	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Selected radiocarbon data on surficial materials from the Labontan basin, Nevada and California, provide a chronology of lake-level variation for the past 50,000 yr. A moderate-sized lake connected three western Lahontan subbasins (the Smoke Creek-Black Rock Desert subbasin, the Pyramid Lake subbasin, and the Winnemucca Dry Lake subbasin) from about 45,000 to 16,500 yr B.P. Between 50,000 and 45,000 yr B.P., Walker Lake rose to its sill level in Adrian Valley and spilled to the Carson Desert subbasin. By 20,000 yr B.P., lake level in the western Lahontan subbasins had risen to about 1265 m above the sea level, where it remained for 3500 yr. By 16,000 yr B.P., lake level in the western Lahontan subbasins had fallen to 1240 m. This recession appears synchronous with a dessication of Walker Lake; however, whether the Walker Lake desiccation resulted from climate change or from diversion of the Walker River is not known. From about 15,000 to 13,500 yr B.P., lake level rapidly rose, so that Lake Lahontan was a single body of water by 14,000 yr B.P. The lake appears to have reached a maximum highstand altitude of 1330 m by 13,500 yr B.P., a condition that persisted until about 12,500 yr B.P., at which time lake level fell .gtoreq. 100 m. No data exist that indicate the level of lakes in the various subbasins between 12,000 and 10,000 yr B.P. During the Holocene, the Lahontan basin was the site of shallow lakes, with many subbasins being the site of one or more periods of desiccation. The shape of the lake-level curve for the three western subbasins indicates that past changes in the hydrologic balance (and hence climate) of the Lahontan basin were large in magnitude and took place in a rapid step-like manner. The rapid changes in lake level are hypothesized to have resulted from changes in the mean position of the jet steam, as it was forced north or south by the changing size and shape of the continental ice sheet.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JUL	1987	28	1					69	85		10.1016/0033-5894(87)90034-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(87)90034-2													WOS:A1987J238700005
J	Akhurst, D; Jones, GB; McConchie, DM				Akhurst, D; Jones, GB; McConchie, DM			The application of sediment capping agents on phosphorus speciation and mobility in a sub-tropical dunal lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Experimental sediment cores from Lake Ainsworth, Australia, were exposed to an induced 46-day, anoxic/oxic cycle in the laboratory, mimicking the seasonal thermal stratification cycle commonly observed in the lake's waters every summer. Under oxic conditions the supply of phosphorus (P) and iron ( Fe) to the overlying water was slow, however, induced anoxia led to an enhanced release of P and Fe from the sediments to the water column. An inverse relationship between total P, Fe and redox potential suggests that Lake Ainsworth sediments are redox sensitive. Phosphorus speciation analysis of Lake Ainsworth sediments revealed the presence of a large pool of organic P, reactive Fe-bound P, and CaCO3-bound P, the latter fraction decreasing during anoxic conditions. Two sediment-capping agents, a lanthanum modified bentonite clay and Bauxsol (a waste product from the aluminium smelting industry) were assessed for their ability to reduce the levels of P released from Lake Ainsworth sediments during the 46-day, anoxic/oxic cycle. The bentonite clay was highly effective at reducing plant available P in anoxic/oxic conditions, but levels of dissolved Fe were enhanced with its use. Although the use of Bauxsol to remove plant available P is not recommended in anoxic waters, its use in suspension in oxic waters warrants further study.

Temporal Stability of Phytoplankton Functional Groups Within Two Agricultural Irrigation Ponds in Maryland, USA	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Phytoplankton functional groups and their influence on water quality have been studied in various types of water bodies but have yet to be studied in agricultural irrigation ponds. Freshwater sources (e.g., lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have been previously shown to exhibit high spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton populations. Improvements in the monitoring of phytoplankton populations may be achieved if patterns of stable spatial variability can be found in the phytoplankton populations through time. The objective of this work was to determine if temporally stable spatial patterns in phytoplankton communities could be detected in agricultural irrigation ponds using a functional group approach. The study was performed at two working agricultural irrigation ponds located in Maryland, USA over two summer sampling campaigns in 2017 and 2018. Concentrations of four phytoplankton groups, along with sensor-based and fluorometer based water quality parameters were measured. Temporal stability was assessed using mean relative differences between measurements in each location and averaged measurements across ponds on each sampling date. Temporally stable spatial patterns of three phytoplankton functional groups were found for both ponds over the two sampling seasons. Both ponds had locations where specific phytoplankton functional group concentrations were consistently higher or lower than the pond's average concentration for each sampling date. Zones of consistently higher or lower than average concentrations were associated with flow conditions, pond morphology, and human activities. The existence of temporally stable patterns of phytoplankton functional group concentrations can affect the outcome of a water quality assessment and should be considered in water quality monitoring designs.

The lakes were chosen to cover the latitudinal range of the species in Patagonia. Diet examined for a subset of these fish (N = 26 1) collected during the summer months (January through March), differed among river basins but there were no clear latitudinal trends in the consumption of any prey type. Diet may, however, have partially shaped morphology, as pelvic measures were negatively correlated with consumption of amphipods. Substantial differentiation among populations was observed, primarily in the shape and dimensions of the head, in caudal morphology and in fin length. Our results indicate that the morphology of G. platei varies with latitude, and may be related to risk of predation and diet. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.

J	PINELALLOUL, B				PINELALLOUL, B			ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF A SMALL LAKE IN THE JAMES BAY AREA	NATURALISTE CANADIEN												To describe the limnetic and littoral zooplankton of a small lake near LG-2 (53.degree.27''50" North; 77.degree.28''11" West), James Bay territory, the plankton was sampled with a Van Dorn bottle (6 l) and filtered through a Wisconsin net (mesh size 153 .mu.m). The limetic and littoral communities showed a wide variety of species (23-37) and a good specific diversity (2.72 to 3.29 bits/ind. [individual]). Although Rotifera were the most abundant group in the center and at the tributary of the lake, they amounted only to a very small part of the zooplankton biomass. Cladocera, particularly in the littoral zone, constituted the bulk of the biomass. In the center of the lake, the mean density was 121 ind./l with a maximum of 312 ind./l and the mean summer biomass was 491 and 1072 .mu.g/l (dry wt; June-Oct.) in 1974 and 1975. The maximum of density in littoral communities ranged 65-298 ind./l and the greatest biomass was observed in Aug. when the Cladocera were the most abundant. For the limnetic community, the seasonal succession of species in each group (Cladocera, Rotifera, Copepoda) was described.

In this study we investigated the still unknown diet of the Sicilian pond turtle, with special emphasis to the relationships with recently introduced alien species in the "Lake Preola and Gorghi Tondi" Nature Reserve (Sicily, Italy). A total of 83 faecal samples were collected in three different periods. Emys trinacris seems an opportunistic and generalist species. The main prey taxa were aquatic invertebrates, including the invasive Procambarus clarkii, while non-aquatic preys are found sporadically. Plant matter, mainly leaves and roots of aquatic forms, was also found in high frequency with a high occurrence of fruits and seeds in spring. We did not find a significant difference in diet composition within sex and age, while an evident divergence was found between periods and sites. In particular, we noticed a decrease in prey abundance and in food-niche breadth from pre-reproductive period to post-reproductive period. Moreover a very clear difference was found between a site with allochthonous fishes and a site fish-free, with a more abundant and wide diet spectrum in the last one, as a result of the increased availability of prey. We highlighted the importance to take any possible actions to avoid the spread of fishes in other basins and to study the indirect impact of Procambarus clarkii, as possible vector of harmful trace element.

Based on size metrics, UA 173/405 is likely associated with an already described pubic symphysis (UA 466) found nearby. The morphology of UA 173/405 was quantitatively characterized using three-dimensional landmark-based morphometrics and linear data. The Buia specimen falls within the range of variation of modern humans for all metrics investigated, making it unlikely that the shared last common ancestor of Late Pleistocene Homo species would have had an australopith-like pelvis. The discovery of UA 173/405 adds to the increasing number of fossils suggesting that the postcranial morphology of Homo erectus s.l. was variable and, in some cases, nearly indistinguishable from modern human morphology. This Eritrean fossil demonstrates that modern human-like pelvic morphology may have had origins in the Early Pleistocene, potentially within later African H. erectus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Parsons, MG; Harkins, RW				Parsons, MG; Harkins, RW			The Great Lakes Ballast Technology Demonstration Project filtration mechanical test program	MARINE TECHNOLOGY AND SNAME NEWS												The Great Lakes Ballast Technology Demonstration Project has investigated the effectiveness of automatic backwash screen filtration of ballast water during its uptake as a means of minimizing the potential for the introduction of nonindigenous species. The Great Lakes Protection Fund; the State of Minnesota, upon the recommendation of the Legislative Commission for Minnesota Resources (LCMR); the Lake Carriers' Association; Northeast-Midwest Institute; Federal agencies and universities have supported this project. Initial testing during the 1997 operating season involved testing onboard the Seaway-sized bulk carrier MV Algonorth during operations between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Great Lakes ports. This testing provided important information on system design, operations, and filtration biological effectiveness, but the mechanical test results were of limited value as benchmark experiments. During the summer of 1998, the modular system was installed on a barge located in the Duluth, Minnesota, harbor to permit more controlled, intensive mechanical and biological testing. The overall design of the shipboard and the barge ballast water filtration test installations are briefly summarized. The barge mechanical test program involved extended testing with 25 micron, 50 micron, and 100 micron filter screens at a nominal 1500 U.S. gpm using an operating profile that approximates normal ship ballast operations. The results of this test program are reported. Lessons learned in the system design, operation, and test program are discussed.																			0025-3316					SUM	2000	37	3					129	140																WOS:000168426300002

In general, the rise in air temperature and the decrease in wind speed weaken the vertical mixing and strengthen the structure of the stratification, which interrupts the transport of the substances. However, how much the change of each climate element can influence the structure of the stratification is not clarified. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effects of each element on the stratification quantitatively. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the change in air temperature and wind speed on the seasonal change of stratification in Lake Biwa by using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Numerical simulations were carried out for a baseline case using realistic meteorological data from 2007 to 2012 and hypothetical cases using meteorological data with modified air temperature or wind speed for sensitivity analysis. The analysis showed that the increase and decrease in air temperature changed the vertical water temperature uniformly in almost all layers. Thus, the strength of the stratification is hardly changed. The increase and decrease in wind speed, however, altered the water temperature near the surface of the lake, so that it significantly influenced the stratification. The increase in wind speed made the water parcels of the surface layer well mixed, and the decrease in wind speed made the mixed layer thinner.

In this article, we present sequence stratigraphic interpretations on a seismic transect across the western part of the semi-isolated Late Miocene-Pliocene Dacic Basin (Eastern Paratethys, Romania), chronologically constrained by biostratigraphic field observations and well data. They reveal significant sea level changes during the middle Pontian that are coeval with the MSC. These changes were most likely transmitted to the western Dacic Basin from the downstream Black Sea and controlled by the sill height of the interconnecting gateway. During the middle Pontian lowstand of the western Dacian Basin, sedimentation continued in a remnant similar to 300 m deep lake with a positive water balance. Our observations show that the evolution of semi-isolated sedimentary basins is strongly dependent on the communication with other depositional realms through its control on base level and sediment supply.

Infections of Dactylogyrus pectenatus (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae) on Larvae of Pimephales promelas (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) in Scott Lake, Ontario, Canada	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY												Larval Pimephales promelas Rafinesque individuals, estimated to be 2 wk posthatch, from a small temperate lake in Algonquin Park, Ontario, were examined for parasites. The monogene Dactylogyrus pectenatus Mayes, 1977 was the only parasite found. Prevalence was 71.4%; mean intensity was 2.3 +/- 1.7 (range 1-9). The presence of gravid parasite, on fish measuring 12 torn in length suggests that the larvae became infected shortly after hatching, and because P. promelas is a fractional spawner, the larvae appear to represent a significant host resource for D. pectenatits during the summer months. The infection of this parasite on these larvae is discussed within the context of assembly of parasite infracommunities of fish.																			1525-2647					JAN	2009	76	1					110	112		10.1654/4370.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1654/4370.1													WOS:000263092500014

We compared a Landsat-derived biomass estimate and modeled solar insolation from a digital elevation model to the geophysical measurements. We show correspondence between vegetation type and biomass relative to permafrost extent and seasonal freeze-thaw. Thicker permafrost (>= 25 m) was covered by greater biomass, and seasonal thaw depths in these regions were minimal (1 m). Shallow (1-3 m depth) and thin (20-50 cm) newly forming permafrost or frozen layers from the previous winter occurred below northward oriented slopes with thin biomass cover. South-facing slopes exhibited permafrost when there was enough biomass to shield incoming solar energy. We developed an artificial neural network to predict permafrost extent across the broader region by mapping GPR-observed instances of permafrost to FDEM, biomass, and terrain observations with 90.2% accuracy. We identified a strong linear correlation (r = -0.77) between permafrost probability and seasonal thaw depth, indicating that our models may also be used to explore thaw patterns and variability in active layer thickness. This study highlights the combined influence of biomass and terrain on the presence of permafrost and the value of evaluating such parameters via remote sensing to predict permafrost spatial or temporal variability. Incorporating diverse geophysical datasets with in-situ validation into machine learning models demonstrates a useful approach to upscale estimated permafrost extent across large Arctic expanses.					; Roy, Samuel/X-5581-2018	Briggs, Martin/0000-0003-3206-4132; Campbell, Seth/0000-0002-9620-8329; Roy, Samuel/0000-0002-2491-948X													1045-6740	1099-1530				JUL	2021	32	3					407	426		10.1002/ppp.2100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp.2100		FEB 2021											WOS:000614752800001

The same localities were revisited in 1994 when most of the streams had been limed. Untreated streams were used as references. Species richness and proportion of predators increased between the two years. The differences are probably due to the warm and dry summer in 1994. However, the proportions of acid-sensitive species in various groups of streams were about the same the two years, indicating that liming had an insignificant effect on the return of these species. The resilience of the bottom fauna may be attributable to biotic conditions or the failure of the practiced liming methods to maintain healthy chemical conditions.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					413	418		10.1007/BF00476864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476864													WOS:A1995UB05300022

Nitrate, nitrite and ammonia reached highest concentrations in March (3.76 .+-. 1.74 mg 1-1), July (575 .+-. 77 .mu.g 1-1) and April (404.6 .+-. 127 .mu.g 1-1) respectively. However, fish kills through nitrite toxicity was not observed at the reported nitrite concentrations. Ammonia decreased during summer mainly due to utilization by phytoplankton blooms. The highest value of soluble reactive phosphorus was observed in April (956 .+-. 44 .mu.g 1-1) attributed to sewage, domestic effluents and also release from sediments. Silica was at a maximum in October and decreased during diatom blooms in December. Clear pattern of diel variation was not observed for nitrate, nitrite and phosphorus. However, ammonia showed diel variation having higher concentrations at 6 h than 12, 18 and 24 h due to its slower uptake by phytoplankton during nights. Chlorophyll a was at a maximum in May (32 mg m-3) at N/P ratio of 5.3 with the dominance of cyanophyceae and chlorophyceae.					; Rodrigues, Nelson/AAH-8861-2020	Prasad, Majeti Narasimha Vara Prasad/0000-0002-2369-571X; 													0370-0097					DEC	1988	98	6					515	522																WOS:A1988R982100010

The surface area is 37.1 km(2), and the average and maximum depths are 19.5 m and 57 m, respectively. Long-term ice phenology time series of Lake Kilpisjarvi, available from 1952, show mean freezing and breakup dates of November 8th and June 18th, respectively. The freezing date has delayed by 2.3 days per decade but the ice breakup date does not show a significant change: A two-year field study was performed in this lake in 2007-2009 with data collected of ice, snow and weather conditions with an automatic ice station in the lake. The heat budget together with ice structure, growth and melting is analysed. It was dominated by the radiation balance. Turbulent heat fluxes were also large (in absolute values) before freeze-up in fall, but in the ice season they were small except that occasionally sensible heat flux was large. The latent heat released/consumed in ice growth/melting corresponded well the measured surface heat balance.																					978-7-89437-020-4				2012							1223	1232																WOS:000396804100115

More than modelling: Building trust for positive change in water resources management	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Hydrologic modelling plays a vital role in water resources management but often falls short of achieving the positive change modelers envision. In this position paper we argue that a key contributing factor is the lack of trust and shared understanding among modelers, decision-makers, and the public. Models need to be trusted first-a social challenge as well as a technical one. Through three case studies-involving groundwater development, a national-scale runoff model, and a declining lake ecosystem-we analyze the interactions between technical modelling, stakeholder engagement, and policy outcomes, drawing on principles from both hydrologic and social sciences. We recommend that hydrologic modelers foster transparency, balance model authority with flexibility, and tailor stakeholder engagement to overall project needs. Implementing these recommendations will enhance the legitimacy of hydrologic models, increasing the likelihood of achieving positive, sustainable change in water resource systems.

The total fraction of water surface (FWS) area, corresponding to small lakes or reservoirs (area < 25 x 25 km(2)), inundated surfaces and natural wetland areas, computed on a weekly basis and averaged over the 1988-2001 period, gives a maximum summer extent of 10.10 +/- 0.21 x 10(5) km(2) for Canada and Alaska and 12.7 +/- 0.35 x 10(5) km(2) for Eurasia, above 50 degrees N. The mean seasonal dynamics of wetland and inundated surfaces shows a maximum area extent during the months of July-August-September over North America (48 degrees N-68 degrees N) and between June and September over northern Eurasia. The interannual variations of the yearly total FWS area since 1988 show a slight increase (8% +/- 3%) in Canada-Alaska, mainly due to a decrease in the snow cover extent. The FWS interannual variability in the Ob River basin, which is well explained by the water discharge variations, shows an increase of 8.5% +/- 1.5% between 1988 and 2001. The microwave-derived FWS estimate and its dynamics present an interesting potential for studying the climate-driven variability of wetlands and inundated areas.					; mialon, arnaud/ABA-3062-2020	mialon, arnaud/0000-0001-7970-0701; 													2169-897X					SEP 3	2005	110	D17							D17102	10.1029/2004JD005697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JD005697													WOS:000231727600001

Mortality as high as 80%-90% was estimated in some of the nesting colonies. Clinical signs observed in 4- to -6wk-old cormorants included torticollis, tremors, ataxia, curled toes, and paresis or weakness of legs, wings or both, which was sometimes unilateral. No significant mortality or unusual clinical signs were seen in adult cormorants. Necropsy of 88 cormorants yielded no consistent gross observations. Microscopic lesions in the brain and spinal cord were consistently present in all cormorants from which Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was isolated. Characteristic brain lesions provided rapid identification of new suspect sites of NVND. Lesions were also present in the heart, kidney, proventriculus, spleen, and pancreas bur were less consistent or nonspecific. NDV was isolated at the National Wildlife Health Center from 27 of 93 cormorants rested. Virus was most frequently isolated from intestine or brain tissue of cormorants submitted within the first 4 wk of the epornitic. Sera collected from cormorants with neurologic signs were consistently positive for NDV antibody. The NDV isolate from cormorants was characterized as NVND virus at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Ames, Iowa. The NVND virus was also identified as the cause of neurologic disease in a North Dakota turkey hock during the summer of 1992. Although no virus was isolated from cormorants rested after the first month of submissions, brain and spinal cord lesions characteristic of NVND were observed in cormorants from affected sires for 2 mo, at which time nesting colonies dispersed and no more submissions were received. Risk to susceptible populations of both wild avian species and domestic poultry makes early recognition and confirmation of NVND in wild birds a priority.

Ladakh, India)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Since 1974, tourists are attracted in Leh district for its mountainous landscape, environment, high altitude lakes, Indus River, beautiful villages and Himalayan people living in scenography valleys filled of Buddhist heritage sites. All makes this region a great place for adventure sports, sightseen, cultural and religious tourism. Tourism industry has rapidly become one of the most important aspects of District development paths. Visitors bring hard currency and spend money contributing to monetary economic boom that can have both positive and negative impacts on the society and territory. Tourism in Leh District has a short season (from May to October) but a highly profitable business especially with national visitors increasing by the day. This study, based on data collected from the Tourism Department in Leh, analyses the international and national tourist arrivals in time series to find out pattern and trends in the historical data and investigate global and local factors affecting tourist inflows (rises or falls) in the District. Yearly arrivals depends on several factors and issues as geopolitical and global economic problems, new trends in tourist destinations, film induced tourism, climate changes, natural disasters, pandemic and more. These unpredictable factors affect tourist flows, decreasing or increasing the arrivals even drastically. The long-term sustainability of the local development must not depend mainly on mass tourism because economic dependence on only one, although promising but fluctuating sector, pose several problems (e.g. impacts and pressure on infrastructures, environment and significant socio-cultural changes.																			2239-5938	2239-6101					2021	10	1					736	745		10.14207/ejsd.2021.v10n1p736	http://dx.doi.org/10.14207/ejsd.2021.v10n1p736													WOS:000625205000027
J	Whitman, RL; Nevers, MB; Gerovac, PJ				Whitman, RL; Nevers, MB; Gerovac, PJ			Interaction of ambient conditions and fecal coliform bacteria in southern Lake Michigan beach waters: Monitoring program implications	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Excessive fecal coliform bacteria in public swimming waters can potentially threaten visitor health. Fecal coliform bacteria (1984-1989) and Escherichia coli (1990-1995) density were monitored weekly at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beaches for 12 summers, and park officials closed swimming areas when fecal coliform density exceeded the state water quality criteria (400 CFU fecal coliforms/100 ml; 235 CFU E. coli/100 mi water). Due to a 24-hour incubation in the fecal coliform and E. coli assays, beaches were closed the day after collection of high fecal coliform. Our analysis suggests that it is not possible to predict one day's fecal coliform count based on the previous day's results in waters taken from southern Lake Michigan beaches. Dispersal and deposition of bacteria were not uniform among sites or across time apparently due to interactions among environmental variables including rainfall, wind direction, water temperature, and bacteria source. Rainfall combined with northwest winds increased bacteria concentrations. Escherichia coli followed a seasonal trend with similar fluctuations in density among beaches. We suggest that the current beach monitoring protocol is inadequate for predicting fecal coliform density at the time of beach closure, and, subsequently, its use for ensuring visitor safety remains questionable.

Recent water-sampling campaigns assessed the extent of groundwater-quality impairment in the Wadi Shueib in Jordan by a comprehensive hydrogeological and hydrochemical characterization of groundwater, wastewater, and imported water with its endmembers Lake Tiberias, Yarmouk River and Mukheiba wellfield. The results of a ternary mixing model with the mass ratios of Cl-/Br- and Ca2+/Mg2+ indicate that Lake Tiberias and Yarmouk River provide most of the imported water at the time of sampling in 2017 and Mukheiba wellfield provided minor amounts. The similarity in seasonal variations of Br- concentrations in the springs and the imported water revealed that imported water has generally a greater impact on groundwater than wastewater. However, the Br- concentrations also showed that the spatial wastewater impact is more visible towards urbanized areas due to increased infiltration of pollutants. The analysis of historical data series demonstrated the long-term urban impact on groundwater by an electrical conductivity increase over several decades, particularly since the mid-1990s, which is related to a doubling of Jordan's population since that time and the associated urban growth. In this context, increased chloride and sulfate concentrations are noticeable due to the increased impact of more highly mineralized imported water and wastewater and decreasing recharge of low-mineralized rainwater. This study showed the hydrochemical differences in the Wadi Shueib groundwater system and serves as an example for the spatial and long-term response of karst aquifers to anthropogenic, seasonally variable input of imported water and wastewater.					; Xanke, Julian/AAP-5336-2021; Goeppert, Nadine/AAB-1849-2020; Goldscheider, Nico/HKN-3715-2023	Xanke, Julian/0000-0002-3528-3827; Grimmeisen, Felix/0000-0002-5228-9251; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2020	28	6					2173	2186		10.1007/s10040-020-02174-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02174-2		JUN 2020											WOS:000538233400001

Transport properties of fast ice within the nearshore	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Fast ice affects many coastlines in high- and mid-latitude regions, shaping the coastal morphology by acting as both a protective barrier from winter storms and as an erosive agent through sediment entrainment and transport. It has been hypothesized that when sediment-rich ice is dislodged and transported beyond the depth of closure by storm waves, sediment is permanently removed from the nearshore, starving the littoral system and facilitating future erosion. However, despite this large potential impact on coastal sediment budgets, the rates and mechanisms of sediment-rich ice transport are poorly constrained. This study investigates the sediment entrainment process by fast ice, the mechanisms needed for ice mobilization, and the force needed to breakup and transport sediment-rich ice. We find that the Coulomb frictional strength of the sediment regulates the fast ice system and that the viscous rheology of the ice has no direct mechanical effect. Importantly, these results show that only the frictional coefficient of the beach sediment needs to be measured to estimate the resistive strength of the fast ice, significantly simplifying the requirements for evaluating the potential for fast ice mobilization and associated sediment transport.

Sinninghe			In situ produced branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in suspended particulate matter from the Yenisei River, Eastern Siberia	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Soil-derived branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in marine river fan sediments have a potential use for determining changes in the mean annual temperature (MAT) and pH of the river watershed soils. Prior to their incorporation in marine sediments, the compounds are transported to the marine system by rivers. However, emerging evidence suggests that the brGDGTs in freshwater systems can be derived from both soil run-off and in situ production. The production of brGDGTs in the river system can complicate the interpretation of the brGDGT signal delivered to the marine system. Therefore, we studied the distribution of brGDGT lipids in suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the Yenisei River. Chromatographic improvements allowed quantification of the recently described hexamethylated brGDGT isomer, characterized by having two methyl groups at the 6/6 ' instead of the 5/5 ' positions, in an environmental dataset for the first time. This novel compound was the most abundant brGDGT in SPM from the Yenisei. Its fractional abundance correlated well with that of the 6-methyl isomer of the hexamethylated brGDGT that contains one cyclopentane moiety. The Yenisei River watershed is characterized by large differences in MAT (>11 degrees C) as it spans a large latitudinal range (46-73 degrees N), which would be expected to be reflected in brGDGT distributions of its soils. However, the brGDGT distributions in its SPM show little variation. Furthermore, the reconstructed pH values are high compared to the watershed soil pH. We, therefore, hypothesize that the brGDGTs in the Yenisei River SPM are predominantly produced in situ and not primarily derived from erosion of soil. This accounts for the absence of a change in the temperature signal, as the river water temperature is more stable. Using a lake calibration, the reconstructed temperature values agree with the mean summer temperatures (MST) recorded. The brGDGTs delivered to the sea by the Yenisei River during this season are thus not soil-derived, possibly complicating the use of brGDGTs in marine sediments for palaeoclimate reconstructions.

J	Semiletov, IP				Semiletov, IP			Aquatic sources and sinks of CO2 and CH4 in the polar regions	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES					Conference on Global Measurement Systems for Atmospheric Composition	MAY, 1997	TORONTO, CANADA	Int Global Atmospher Chem Program, Stratospher Proc & Their Role Climate, Global Atmospher Watch, Canadian Space Agcy, Atmospher Environm Serv				The highest concentration and greatest seasonal amplitudes of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 occur at 60 degrees-70 degrees N, outside the 30 degrees-60 degrees N band where the main sources of anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 are located, indicating that the northern environment is a source of these gases. Based on the author's onshore and offshore arctic experimental results and literature data, an attempt was made to identify the main northern sources and sinks for atmospheric CH4 and CO2. The CH4 efflux from limnic environments in the north plays a significant role in the CH4 regional budget, whereas the role of the adjacent arctic adjacent seas in regional CH4 emission is small. This agrees with the aircraft data, which show a 10%-15% increase of CH4 over land when aircraft fly southward from the Arctic Basin. Offshore permafrost might add some CH4 into the atmosphere, although the preliminary data are not sufficient to estimate the effect. Evolution of the northern lakes might be considered as an important component of the climatic system. All-season data obtained in the delta system of the Lena River and typical northern lakes show that the freshwaters are supersaturated by CO2 with a drastic increase in the CO2 value during wintertime. The arctic and antarctic CO2 data presented here may be used to develop understanding of the processes controlling CO2 flux in the polar seas. It is shown that Arctic seas are a sink for atmospheric CO2 though supersaturation by CO2 is obtained in areas influenced by riverine output and in coastal sites. The pCO(2) difference between the surface of the Southern Ocean and atmosphere observed in the austral autumn shows that the area east of 7 degrees W might be considered a source of CO2 into the atmosphere, whereas the area west of 7 degrees W is a net sink of CO2. This is corroborated with literature data that indicate an overestimate of the role of antarctic waters as a sink for atmospheric CO2.					; Semiletov, Igor/B-3616-2013	Semiletov, Igor/0000-0003-1741-6734; 													0022-4928	1520-0469				JAN 15	1999	56	2					286	306		10.1175/1520-0469(1999)056<0286:ASASOC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1999)056<0286:ASASOC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078226000012
J	KEMP, A; BERNATCHEZ, L; DODSON, JJ				KEMP, A; BERNATCHEZ, L; DODSON, JJ			A REVISION OF COREGONINE FISH DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE IN EASTERN JAMES-HUDSON BAY	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Recent sampling programs conducted in the estuaries of the Eastmain and La Grande rivers (James Bay) and the Great Whale, Little Whale, Innuksuac and Povungnituk rivers (Hudson Bay) revealed patterns of coregonine fish distribution that differ from previous observations. The relative abundance of cisco, Coregonus artedii, and lake whitefish, C. clupeaformis, varied among rivers but did not reveal a latitudinal cline. Previous sampling programs underestimated the abundance of cisco in the Little Whale River. In addition, cisco was the third most abundant species captured in the Povungnituk River, situated 200 km to the north of the previously proposed northern limit at Innuksuac River. As such, the low abundances of cisco in the Great Whale and Innuksuac rivers cannot be attributed to a physiological inability to cope with a reduced growing season. Immature cisco were almost totally absent from the estuaries of the Hudson Bay rivers following spring breakup whereas immature lake whitefish made up 100% of the catch in the Innuksuac River at the same time of year. Species-specific migration patterns in Hudson Bay that differ from those observed in James Bay and the existence of unique juvenile overwintering rivers are 2 hypotheses proposed to explain the discontinuous age-class distribution of cisco and lake whitefish observed in Hudson Bay.

Investigating fish migration, mortality, and physiology to improve conservation planning of anadromous salmonids: a case study on the endangered North Sea houting (Coregonus oxyrinchus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Understanding migratory behavior, mortality, and physiology is essential for conservation of many species, particularly anadromous fish. In this study, freshwater and marine migrations of the endangered salmonid North Sea houting (Coregonus oxyrinchus (Linnaeus, 1758)) were investigated using telemetry. Furthermore, physiological samples were collected from North Sea houting and from resident and anadromous populations of the closely related European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (Linnaeus, 1758)) to compare hypo-osmotic tolerances. On average, North Sea houting spent 193 days at sea where the mortality was 36%. Most fish returned from sea in the autumn, and river entry correlated inversely with river temperature and positively with discharge. Fish spent an average of 49 days in the estuarine area. Artificial lakes negatively affected migration speeds. Migration speeds did not differ consistently between individuals (i.e., not a repeatable trait) but correlated positively with water temperature. Fish arrived at spawning areas in November. In the post-spawning state, Na+/K+-ATPase activities were elevated in North Sea houting and anadromous whitefish compared with resident whitefish, while osmolality was elevated only in North Sea houting. Our study provides important information for conservation planning related to the Habitat Directive of the European Union that lists the North Sea houting as critically endangered.

Due to the different water quality properties of the rivers and creeks draining into the Broadwater, sampling sites were grouped in clusters, with cluster-specific empirical/semi-empirical prediction models developed and validated with a leave-one-out cross validation approach for robustness. For unsampled locations, a weighted-average approach, based on their proximity to sampled sites, was developed. Confidence intervals were also generated, with a bootstrapping approach and visualised through maps. Models yielded varying accuracies (R2 = 0.40-0.75). Results show that, for the most significant poor water quality event in the dataset, caused by summer rainfall events, elevated TSS concentrations originated in the northern rivers, slowly spreading southward. Conversely, high chl-a concentrations were first recorded in the southernmost regions of the Broadwater.

Solar radiation and ice melting in Lake Vendyurskoe, Russian Karelia	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Field experiments were conducted during two melting periods, April 2006 and April 2007, Lake Vendyurskoe. The observation programme included weather, ice and snow thickness and structure, water temperature and solar radiation transfer through the ice. Albedo showed a systematic decrease from 0.5-0.8 for wintertime dry ice and snow to 0.1 for wet bare ice in spring, with spatial standard deviation of about 10%. The e-folding depth of light level was 60-80 cm for congelation ice and 15cm for snow-ice. Light transmissivity of the ice cover increased from melting but decreased from ice deterioration; it varied between 0.25-0.35 in 2006, while in 2007 there was a systematic trend from 0.1 to 0.5 in six days. The heat budget was governed by net solar radiation with daily peaks up to 400-500Wm(-2) on clear days. The average daily melt was 1.2 cm at the surface, 0.5 cm at the bottom and 1-2 cm (thickness equivalent) in the interior.

Quantifying long-term phenological patterns of aerial insectivores roosting in the Great Lakes region using weather surveillance radar	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Organisms have been shifting their timing of life history events (phenology) in response to changes in the emergence of resources induced by climate change. Yet understanding these patterns at large scales and across long time series is often challenging. Here we used the US weather surveillance radar network to collect data on the timing of communal swallow and martin roosts and evaluate the scale of phenological shifts and its potential association with temperature. The discrete morning departures of these aggregated aerial insectivores from ground-based roosting locations are detected by radars around sunrise. For the first time, we applied a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect and track these large-scale behaviors. We used 21 years of data from 12 weather surveillance radar stations in the Great Lakes region to quantify the phenology in roosting behavior of aerial insectivores at three spatial levels: local roost cluster, radar station, and across the Great Lakes region. We show that their peak roosting activity timing has advanced by 2.26 days per decade at the regional scale. Similar signals of advancement were found at the station scale, but not at the local roost cluster scale. Air temperature trends in the Great Lakes region during the active roosting period were predictive of later stages of roosting phenology trends (75% and 90% passage dates). Our study represents one of the longest-term broad-scale phenology examinations of avian aerial insectivore species responding to environmental change and provides a stepping stone for examining potential phenological mismatches across trophic levels at broad spatial scales.					; Kelly, Jeffrey/B-2029-2015; Belotti, Maria/GRE-6731-2022; Perez, Gustavo/JXN-9807-2024	Zhao, Wenlong/0000-0002-6153-1396; MAJI, SUBHRANSU/0000-0002-3869-9334; Kelly, Jeffrey/0000-0002-8255-7990; Perez, Gustavo/0000-0003-3880-8075; Belotti, Maria Carolina/0000-0001-5595-8775; Simons, Victoria/0000-0001-9757-2205; Tielens, Elske/0000-0001-7940-5657; Cheng, Zezhou/0000-0001-7754-0871; Deng, Yuting/0000-0001-8110-0414; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2023	29	5					1407	1419		10.1111/gcb.16509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16509		NOV 2022						36397251					WOS:000889434700001
J	Miner, T; Sousounis, PJ; Wallman, J; Mann, G				Miner, T; Sousounis, PJ; Wallman, J; Mann, G			Hurricane huron	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												An intense cutoff low developed over the Great Lakes during the period 11-15 September 1996. As the low deepened, height falls in the lower troposphere exceeded those at upper levels, the cold-core low evolved into a warm core system, and vertical wind (speed and directional) shear decreased dramatically. The low eventually developed an eye and spiral bands of convective showers. In addition, the cyclone briefly produced tropical storm force winds and excessive rain (> 10 cm) that caused flooding. From a satellite perspective, this system bore a striking resemblance to a hurricane. It is believed to be the first time that such a feature has been documented over the Great Lakes. Because the initially cold-core cyclone moved slowly across the Great Lakes when they were near climatological peak temperature, heat fluxes, particularly latent heat fluxes, were unusually large. For this reason, it is hypothesized that the lakes, especially Lake Huron, played an integral role in the system's development. An analysis of the static stability present during the event suggests that a deep layer of conditional instability allowed lake-modified air parcels to reach altitudes not normally associated with lake-forced convection. The hypothesis that the heat and moisture fluxes from the Great Lakes played a significant role in the system's development is supported by the following: 1) The cyclone deepened considerably in the presence of very weak baroclinicity, with the most substantial height falls occurring after the system reached Lake Huron. 2) The combination of surface sensible (F-s) and latent (F-h) heat fluxes exceeded 700 W m(-2) during the low's development. This value is comparable to flux calculations during wintertime arctic air outbreaks over the Great Lakes as well as for polar low cases and category one hurricanes. 3) The low strengthened considerably more at lower levels than at upper levels. 4) The thermal structure of the cyclone appeared to evolve into a warm-core feature from its original cold-core structure, with a significant positive tropospheric thickness anomaly observed over the system's center.

Tundra lake changes from 1978 to 2001 on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, western Canadian Arctic	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Landsat scenes spanning 1978-2001 were used to classify thermokarst lake area and determine changes in lake coverage on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in northwestern Canada. Changes in total lake area between scenes were substantial, spanning a 14% increase and 11% decrease, mostly owing to changes in the area of lakes > 1.3 km(2) in area. Increases in total lake area occurred primarily between 1978-1992, and decreases between 1992-2001. Differences in total lake area between scenes from different years depend strongly on cumulative precipitation in the 12 month period preceding scene acquisition (r(2) = 0.82), and not on summer or mean annual air temperature (MAAT). Our results indicate that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the areal extent of lakes as detected by remote sensing. On the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, persistent lake area changes (if any) such as might occur by regional warming or changes in evaporation/precipitation balance over decades, are well-masked by short-term climatological changes.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 5	2008	35	3							L03502	10.1029/2007GL032303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032303													WOS:000253063400005

For highly clonal aquatic macrophytes, however, there is a lack of information on seed production and seed fate as compared with annual sexual species. The seed bank for three populations of Vallisneria americana in the Huron-Erie corridor of the Great Lakes was sampled and quantified in the spring of 1994, and related to seed production in the previous season at these sites. Seed deposition rates during 1994 were also assessed. Sites varied in the proportion of plants flowering and in their tertiary sex ratios, but did not differ in seed numbers produced per unit area. The size of the seed bank was not significantly related to the previous season's seed output, and estimates of seed deposition in the following year tended to be approximately tenfold greater than seed densities found in the seed bank. The stages between seed production and subsequent seed germination are generally very dynamic, with dispersal, mortality, and predation as likely regulating factors. The potential for seedling establishment in V. americana needs to be assessed more fully before the role of seeds in population processes can be determined.					; Lokker, Cynthia/L-4177-2017	Lokker, Cynthia/0000-0003-2436-4290; 													0002-9122					OCT	1997	84	10					1420	1428		10.2307/2446140	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2446140								21708549					WOS:A1997YB41500011

Difficulty in Discerning Drivers of Lake Ecosystem Metabolism with High-Frequency Data	ECOSYSTEMS												High-frequency measurements are increasingly available and used to model ecosystem processes. This growing capability provides the opportunity to resolve key drivers of ecosystem processes at a variety of scales. We use a unique series of high-frequency measures of potential predictors to analyze daily variation in rates of gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP - R) for two north temperate lakes. Wind speed, temperature, light, precipitation, mixed layer depth, water column stability, chlorophyll a, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and zooplankton biomass were measured at daily or higher-frequency intervals over two summer seasons. We hypothesized that light, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton biomass would be strongly related to variability in GPP. We also hypothesized that chlorophyll a, CDOM, and temperature would be most strongly related to variability in R, whereas NEP would be related to variation in chlorophyll a and CDOM. Consistent with our hypotheses, chlorophyll a was among the most important drivers of GPP, R, and NEP in these systems. However, multiple regression models did not necessarily include the other variables we hypothesized as most important. Despite the large number of potential predictor variables, substantial variance remained unexplained and models were inconsistent between years and between lakes. Drivers of GPP, R, and NEP were difficult to resolve at daily time scales where strong seasonal dynamics were absent. More complex models with greater integration of physical processes are needed to better identify the underlying drivers of short-term variability of ecosystem processes in lakes and other systems.

Both microcystin-producing Anabaena and Microcystis were identified in Lake Tuusulanjarvi samples. Microcystis transcribed the mcyE genes throughout the summer of 2006, while expression by Anabaena became evident later in August and September. Active mcyE gene expression was also detectable when microcystin concentrations were very low. Detection of Anabaena mcyE transcripts by qPCR, as well as certain cyanobacterial 16S rRNAs with the chip assay, showed slightly reduced sensitivity compared with the DNA analyses. In contrast, even groups undetectable or present in low quantities as determined by microscopy could be identified with the chip assay from DNA samples. The methods introduced add to the previously scarce repertoire of applications for mcy expression profiling in environmental samples and enable in situ studies of regulation of microcystin synthesis in response to environmental factors.

Rift nucleation, rift propagation and the creation of basement micro-plates within active rifts	TECTONOPHYSICS												In this contribution we study the dynamics of rift nucleation and the interaction of propagating rift segments. We use the East African Rift System (EARS) as a case study with special emphasis on the Albertine rift system situated within the western branch of the EARS with the 5000 in high Rwenzori horst, a basement block that was captured by two rift segments. Fieldwork in the Rwenzori mountains shows that the range is not only affected by range parallel faults but that major fault sets cut across the Rwenzoris. In order to understand these complex fault patterns and the dynamics of the process that leads to the capturing of basement blocks within the extending rift system we developed a two-dimensional visco-elasto-plastic spring model. The model shows that propagating rift faults commonly capture micro-plates with shapes similar to the Rwenzori mountains. These micro-plates rotate during successive rift opening in a clockwise or anti-clockwise sense depending on the direction of the rift segment overstep. A left-lateral overstep as is the case for the Albertine rift system produces a clock-wise rotation of the associated micro-plate indicating that the Rwenzori mountains rotate clockwise. During the rotation of the micro-plate the local stress field at the rift segment tips is perturbed so that the rifts turn 70 to 90 degrees and propagate towards each other to capture the plates completely. This perturbed stress field produces an extensional fault set that is oriented almost parallel to the far field extension direction and explains the range cutting faults that we find in the Rwenzori mountains. The large-scale geometry of the rift system seems to be strongly controlled by rigid cratons in the lithosphere leading to a curvature of the western branch of the EARS and a sinistral wrench component in the lake Albert rift north of the Rwenzori mountains. Capturing of micro-plates of various sizes within the rift system is a common phenomenon and leads to strong perturbations of the local stress field during micro-plate rotation. The resulting structures are normal and strike-slip faults that cut through the micro-plates and local reverse faults. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Surveys confirmed that P. digoneutis populations have become established throughout eastern North America and that the spread of the parasitoid continues. For unknown reasons, previous releases of P. digoneutis in Western Canada were not successful. 2 A bioclimate (climex (R); Hearne Scientific Software Pty Ltd, Australia) model for P. digoneutis in North America was developed, based on climate and ecological parameters, and then validated with actual distribution records. The current distribution of P. digoneutis in eastern North America was consistent with the predicted distribution. The model suggests that P. digoneutis will probably continue its spread westwards throughout the U.S.A. along the Great Lakes. 3 The southern distribution of P. digoneutis is expected to be limited by hot summer temperatures, whereas its northern range is limited by the number of Lygus host generations rather than cold stress. 4 Peristenus digoneutis has the potential to occur in the southern parts of the prairie ecozone of western Canada; however, Ecoclimatic Index values in the prairies indicate mainly marginal or unfavourable conditions, which may explain why earlier releases of P. digoneutis in Western Canada failed.																			1461-9555	1461-9563				FEB	2013	15	1					43	55		10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00590.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00590.x													WOS:000313885500005

The record dates, based upon a thermoluminescence chronology and other evidence, to Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5); the exact timing is impossible to ascertain given the resolution of the thermoluminescence results and the presence of an unconformity in the dated section. The presence of a cool-temperate rainforest flora, outside its modern range, and other independent evidence, suggest the sequence may represent the last interglacial (MIS 5e) rather than a later MIS 5 substage. Using coexistence methods that compare modern climatic ranges of the taxa in the assemblage we reconstruct independent beetle and plant based annual and seasonal temperate and precipitation parameters. The results imply the assemblage was deposited under a wetter summer climate and suggest conditions of enhanced temperature seasonality. It is probable that enhanced temperature seasonality is a methodological artefact reflecting the rarity of extremely equable climates (like King Island) in modern climate space. This would indicate a limitation of most methods of palaeoclimatic reconstruction that rely on modern datasets - it is only possible to reconstruct past climates as being within the range of values in that currently exist in modern climate space.

J	Copilas-Ciocianu, D; Sidorov, D				Copilas-Ciocianu, Denis; Sidorov, Dmitry			Taxonomic, ecological and morphological diversity of Ponto-Caspian gammaroidean amphipods: a review	ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION												The dynamic geological history of the Ponto-Caspian region drove the evolution of a highly adaptable endemic fauna that gave rise to notorious aquatic invaders. Amphipod crustaceans of the superfamily Gammaroidea attained considerable diversity, becoming the world's second most speciose ancient lake amphipod radiation. Nonetheless, apart from a few species that became invasive, this group remains poorly studied. Herein, we review and quantify the taxonomic, morphological and ecological diversity, as well as the phylogenetic context of Ponto-Caspian gammaroids within the adaptive radiation framework. Molecular phylogenies indicate that this radiation has a likely monophyletic mid-Miocene Paratethyan origin and is nested within the morphologically conserved Atlanto-Mediterranean Echinogammarus clade. We find extensive disparity in body shape, size, ornamentation and appendage length, along a broad ecological gradient from mountain springs to depths exceeding 500 m, on virtually all substrate types (including symbiosis). We propose four putative ecomorphs that appear convergent with distantly related oceanic and Baikal Lake taxa. Thus, the identified patterns support the adaptive radiation hypothesis, although extensive further research is needed.

Sedimentological, mineralogical, and major and trace element geochemical data indicates that: (1) the bentonite formed by devitrification of felsic volcanic ash; (2) the deposit was reworked by gentle currents in an ephemeral lake where intense chemical weathering of the volcanic ash occurred; and (3) the source of the original felsic volcanic material was probably in southwest Gondwana (now South America) where explosive silicic igneous activity has been documented not only in the Permian, but also in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic.

J	Tallberg, P				Tallberg, P			The magnitude of Si dissolution from diatoms at the sediment surface and its potential impact on P mobilization	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The magnitude of the influence of diatom-derived dissolved Si on the mobility of P at the sediment-water interface was investigated in eutrophic Lake Vesijarvi, southern Finland. The spring bloom, which consisted of small centric diatoms, depleted the Si from the water column (<100 mu g l(-1)) and was followed by a sharp increase in the diatom numbers at the sediment surface and by a peak of dissolved Si in the sediment interstitial water. The diatom cells disappeared from the surface sediment on a time scale of weeks (5 % d(-1)). Calculations based on the cell numbers and on the Si deficit in the water column indicated that the dissolution of diatoms in the sediment surface layer may produce Si pulses high enough to influence the mobility of P.																			0003-9136					MAR	1999	144	4					429	438																WOS:000079743800003

Modeling sinking rate of zooplankton carcasses: Effects of stratification and mixing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Using the carcass sinking rate and density determined in laboratory for several freshwater zooplankton species, we developed a model of zooplankton carcass sinking as affected by turbulence and stratification. The model was subsequently used to estimate the residence time of zooplankton carcasses in the water column of Lake Stechlin, a typical temperate dimictic lake in northeastern Germany. The residence time varied among the different species and was strongly affected by thermal stratification. At the peak of summer stratification, the carcasses stayed up to 5 d in the 70 m-deep water column before reaching the lake bottom. Residence time was long enough that zooplankton carcasses could serve as an important matter and energy source for bacteria in the lake's pelagic zone and hence have the potential to significantly affect aquatic carbon and nutrient cycling. The proposed model of sinking rates, based on physically sound relationships, can be easily applied to other passively sinking particles, and be integrated into large ecosystem models.

Potential impacts of climate change on water availability for crops in the Okanagan Basin, British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Crop water demand in the Okanagan Basin was determined for 1961 to 1990, 2010 to 2039, 2040 to 2069, and 2070 to 2099. Daily station temperature data were spatially interpolated to a I x I km grid and adjusted for elevation. Daily precipitation data were estimated across four climatic regions. Output from three global climate models (GCM), CGCM2, CSIROMk2 and HadCM3 was used to create future daily climate. Daily potential evapo-transpiration (grass reference) was estimated from an empirical relationship between Bellani-plate atmometer readings, temperature and extra-terrestrial solar radiation, and then modified by crop coefficients for all crops except pasture. Depending on GCM, projected water demand increased by 12-20% (2010 to 2039), 24-38% (2040 to 2069) and 40-61% (2070 to 2099). Possible elevated CO2 effects on stomatal conductance which may reduce water demand were not accounted for. Comparisons with modeled Okanagan Lake inflows indicated that, on average, high water demand and low supply scenarios coincided. In one sub-basin, supply and demand thresholds were exceeded 1 yr in 6 (HadCM3) in the 2050s and at least 1 yr in 4 for all GCMs by the 2080s, and existing water supply infrastructure may be inadequate. Crop growing seasons were defined empirically from growing degree days or threshold temperatures. The growing season lengthened up to 30-35% leading to higher demand in fall and shortages due to low stream flows.

Expect the unexpected: a new ant from a backyard in Utah	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Urban centers are not where one expects to find new species. Yet, we report here a newly recognized ant, Strumigenys ananeotes sp. nov., in an urban yard in Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, Utah, USA. The genus Strumigenys is a major radiation of litter ants that are found primarily in the wet tropics and subtropics. They are extremely rare in western North America, known only from sites hundreds of kilometers south and west of Salt Lake City. The new species is related to species from southern Arizona and is presumed native. We propose that it is normally restricted to moist, subterranean microhabitats in an otherwise arid region, but that anthropogenic activity has created an urban forest with summer conditions similar to eastern deciduous forest. Strumigenys ananeotes may now have a greatly expanded habitat and visibility, a case of a native species benefiting from human development rather than being displaced.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				JAN	2020	79	4					496	499		10.3398/064.079.0403	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.079.0403													WOS:000508134300003

The planktonic Cyclotella ocellata-complex dominates the diatom assemblage through most of the core record, persisting through a variety of climate conditions. Periphytic diatoms, although less abundant, have greater diversity and greater down-core assemblage variation. During warm climate modes, longer summer ice-free conditions may have allowed more complex diatom communities to develop in shallow-water habitats, and enhanced circulation may have increased transport of these diatoms to deeper parts of the lake. Zones of low overall diatom abundance further support inferred intervals of low lake productivity during times of extended lake ice and snow cover. More data on the modern spatial and temporal distribution of diatom species in the Lake El'gygytgyn system will improve inferences from core records.

J	Li, Y; Wang, NA; Zhang, CQ				Li, Yu; Wang, Nai'ang; Zhang, Chengqi			An Abrupt Centennial-Scale Drought Event and Mid-Holocene Climate Change Patterns in Monsoon Marginal Zones of East Asia	PLOS ONE												The mid-latitudes of East Asia are characterized by the interaction between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerly winds. Understanding long-term climate change in the marginal regions of the Asian monsoon is critical for understanding the millennial-scale interactions between the Asian monsoon and the westerly winds. Abrupt climate events are always associated with changes in large-scale circulation patterns; therefore, investigations into abrupt climate changes provide clues for responses of circulation patterns to extreme climate events. In this paper, we examined the time scale and mid-Holocene climatic background of an abrupt dry mid-Holocene event in the Shiyang River drainage basin in the northwest margin of the Asian monsoon. Mid-Holocene lacustrine records were collected from the middle reaches and the terminal lake of the basin. Using radiocarbon and OSL ages, a centennial-scale drought event, which is characterized by a sand layer in lacustrine sediments both from the middle and lower reaches of the basin, was absolutely dated between 8.0-7.0 cal kyr BP. Grain size data suggest an abrupt decline in lake level and a dry environment in the middle reaches of the basin during the dry interval. Previous studies have shown mid-Holocene drought events in other places of monsoon marginal zones; however, their chronologies are not strong enough to study the mechanism. According to the absolutely dated records, we proposed a new hypothesis that the mid-Holocene dry interval can be related to the weakening Asian summer monsoon and the relatively arid environment in arid Central Asia. Furthermore, abrupt dry climatic events are directly linked to the basin-wide effective moisture change in semi-arid and arid regions. Effective moisture is affected by basin-wide precipitation, evapotranspiration, lake surface evaporation and other geographical settings. As a result, the time scales of the dry interval could vary according to locations due to different geographical features.

To address the complexities associated with the staggered distribution of natural rivers and artificial canals within the agricultural irrigated region of the ALB, an inverse computation method to gauge canal water requirements was used in building an intelligent simulation of water diversion and conveyance, incorporating different water use methodologies for complex canal systems within the irrigated region. Additionally, this paper characterizes the interaction between the catchment and conveyance section of the Karez wells and the underground aquifer based on the seasonal river module to simulate the entire flow process of the Karez well system, from water extraction and conveyance to groundwater recharge by infiltration. This study presents a coupled simulation model of seasonal river-lake- groundwater interactions in the ALB, where groundwater is simulated under both steady and unsteady flows. The findings indicate that from 2013 to 2022, the annual average groundwater recharge within the ALB was approximately 1.048 billion m3, while the discharge was 1.221 billion m3, with an annual average groundwater overexploitation of 173 million m3. Furthermore, the long-term overexploitation of groundwater has had a direct impact on the ecological environment, resulting in a survival crisis for natural vegetation except in the upper vegetative zone of Aiding Lake, which has good groundwater recharge conditions.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2024	632								130896	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130896		FEB 2024											WOS:001196785800001
J	Tornblom, E; Rydin, E				Tornblom, E; Rydin, E			Bacterial and phosphorus dynamics in profundal Lake Erken sediments following the deposition of diatoms: a laboratory study	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The benthic microbial response to the deposition of natural seston and the microbial impact on nutrient dynamics was studied in an experimental system using whole sediment cores equipped with flow-through systems for the overlying water. For 20 days, changes in sediment bacterial activity, total metabolic activity (heat production), bacterial biomass, phosphorus fractions and basic chemistry were followed, as well as the exchange of nutrients between sediment and water. Microbial activity and biomass increased immediately in response to the deposition of seston, peaked after seven days and then decreased linearly over the remaining time of the experiment. Co-settled bacteria were suggested to play an important role in the microbial response. Changes in bacterial biomass production, bacterial biomass and the NaOH-nrP extractable phosphorus fraction were concurrent in response to seston additions. The sediment acted as a trap for SRP from the overlying water when bacterial activity was high and as a source when the bacterial activity decreased. Altogether, the results suggest an important role of bacteria in the regeneration of seston P. Mineralization rates estimated from sediment heat production showed that ca. 11% of the added seston carbon was oxidized in the sediments during the experiment.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	364		1				55	63																WOS:000074811400006

The artificial calcite precipitation was induced by hypolimnetic injection of CaO in enclosures during the summer stagnation. The hypolimnetic injection of CaO was combined with aeration for 1 day. The coprecipitation of phosphorus with calcite was shown by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The content of phosphorus in the calcite was about 0.1 wt%. Phosphorus was homogeneously distributed throughout the precipitated calcite and throughout the calcinated particles of water and sediment. The phosphorus coprecipitation efficiency was calculated from the ratio of the decrease of phosphorus to decrease of calcium in the water according to the House's coprecipitation model.

Relative impact of windblown dust versus anthropogenic fugitive dust in PM2.5 on air quality in North America	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A new windblown dust emissions module was recently implemented into A Unified Regional Air Quality Modeling System (AURAMS), a Canadian regional air quality model, to investigate the relative impact of windblown dust versus anthropogenic fugitive dust on air quality in North America. In order to apply the windblown dust emissions module to the entire North American continent, a soil grain size distribution map was developed using the outputs of 4 monthly runs of AURAMS for 2002 and available PM2.5 dust content observations. The simulation results using the new soil grain size distribution map showed that inclusion of windblown dust emissions is essential to predict the impact of dust aerosols on air quality in North America, especially in the western United States. The windblown dust emissions varied widely by season, whereas the anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions did not change significantly. In the spring (April), the continental monthly average emissions rate of windblown dust (4.1 x 10(7) kg/d) was much higher than that of anthropogenic fugitive dust (1.5 x 10(7) kg/d). The total amount of windblown dust emissions in North America predicted by the model for 2002 was comparable to that of anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions. Even with the inclusion of windblown dust emissions, however, the model still had difficulty simulating dust concentrations. Further improvements are needed, in terms of both limitations of the windblown dust emission module and uncertainties in the anthropogenic fugitive dust emissions inventories, for improved dust modeling.

This study provides evidences that the quantity of macro- and trace elements accumulated in the macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum depends strongly on the seasonality, on the vertical position of the plant material and on the biofilm cover. Element contents of macrophytes with and without biofilm cover and that of vertical plant sections were investigated by an ICP-MS technique in three different habitats, at the beginning and at the end of the vegetation period. Results demonstrated that the element concentrations of Ceratophyllum demersum dropped to one-half and one-eighth by the end of the summer; and the amount of certain elements in the lower part of plants were up to six times higher than in the upper and in plants with well-developed epiphytic microbial community 2-5-fold higher than in plants without biofilm. These results help in phytoremediation practice and in setting up future biomonitoring studies. When it is necessary to calculate the exact amount of elements which can be accumulated by plants in a polluted environment or should be removed from a contaminated water by harvesting macrophytes, it is of high importance to consider the month of the study, the plant parts harvested and the biofilm cover.

Estimating fishing effort across the landscape: A spatially extensive approach using models to integrate multiple data sources	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Measuring fishing effort is one important element for effective management of recreational fisheries. Traditional intensive angler intercept survey methods collect many observations on a few water bodies per year to produce highly accurate estimates of fishing effort. However, scaling up this approach to understand landscapes with many systems, such as lake districts, is problematic. In these situations, spatially extensive sampling might be preferable to the traditional intensive sampling method. Here we validate a model-based approach that uses a smaller number of observations collected using multiple methods from many fishing sites to estimate total fishing effort across a fisheries landscape. We distributed on-site and aerial observations of fishing effort across 44 lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin and then used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to account for seasonal and daily trends as well as lake-specific differences in mean fishing effort. Estimates of total summer fishing effort predicted by GLMMs were on average within 11 % of those produced by traditional mean expansion. These estimates required less sampling effort per lake and can be produced for many more lakes per year. In spite of the higher uncertainty associated with model-based estimates from fewer observations, the improvements associated with the addition of only three aerial observations per lake highlighted the potential for improved precision with relatively few additional observations. Thus, the combination of GLMMs and extensive data collection from multiple sources could be used to estimate fishing effort in regions where intensive data collection for all fishing sites is infeasible, such as lake-rich landscapes. By using these methods of extensive data collection and model-based analysis, managers can produce frequently updated assessments of system states, which are important in developing proactive and dynamic management policies.

J	Hopkins, D; Higham, JES; Becken, S				Hopkins, Debbie; Higham, James E. S.; Becken, Susanne			Climate change in a regional context: relative vulnerability in the Australasian skier market	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The concept of relative vulnerability allows for comparisons between analogous units in a regional context. It is utilised within tourism studies to consider how climate change might affect demand and perceived attractiveness of destinations relative to their competitors. This paper examines Australian tourists travelling to New Zealand's ski fields, responding to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) assertion that, "tourist flows from Australia to New Zealand might grow as a result of the relatively poorer snow conditions in Australia" (Hennessy et al. 2007: p 523). This travel flow is not a new phenomenon; however, it is forecast to increase as climate change impacts upon Australia's natural and man-made snowmaking capacity with implications for the viability of the ski industries in both Australia and New Zealand. The Queenstown Lakes Region (South Island, New Zealand) serves as the field area for this study. The empirical research utilises a qualitative methodology for which in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with New Zealand ski industry representatives and Australian tourists during the southern hemisphere winter season of 2011. Findings suggest that the social context of vulnerability creates difficulty in forecasting the outcomes and behaviours associated with relative vulnerability. While tourism representatives' focus on snow reliability and availability to conceptualise relative vulnerability, Australian tourists are influenced by a broader range of factors including their own travel experience. This paper demonstrates a clear need to move beyond a focus on snow reliability to consider the broad range of factors that contribute to regional variations in vulnerability. In doing so, it confirms the critical importance of situating relative vulnerability within a social context.

The organism hovers in the metalimnion by regulating its buoyancy, provided by gas vesicles. The daily integral of primary production by the organism has been calculated from its P/I curve and measurements of the vertical distributions of Planktothrix sp., irradiance and temperature in the lake, using numerical integration with Excel spreadsheets. The basic methods are described and the particular problems of analysing production by stratified populations are discussed. Daily integrals of primary production based on measured growth/irradiance (mu /I) curves of P. rubescens produce a closer correspondence to the changes in the natural population than do integrals based on P/I curves.																			1015-1621						2001	63	1					18	43																WOS:000167989200003

While the bacterial carotenoids did not produce a recognizable signal in the images, the presence of chlorophyll-containing algae in high densities in April 1992 was easily detected. The image obtained at the time of the onset of the bloom suggested that the algal bloom originated at the shallow areas near the shore of the lake, and was probably derived from resting cells that survived near the surface of the sediment. Information was also obtained on the mode of mixing of Dead Sea brines with freshwater from the Jordan River and from freshwater springs.

Mapping and identification of ice-sheet and glacier features using optical and SAR data in parts of central Dronning Maud Land (cDML), East Antarctica	POLAR SCIENCE												High-resolution satellite data is used to extract ice-sheet features in Princess-Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, in Droning Maud Land between 70 degrees and 72 degrees S and 5 degrees-20 degrees E, East Antarctica. Their mapping and monitoring is cumbersome and time-consuming using traditional survey methods. Therefore, to achieve desirable results, RS based methods were employed. The main ice-sheet and glacial features mapped are Bluelce-Area (BIA), melt water channels, glacier radar zones, crevasse, nunataks, moraine, supraglacial lakes, and wind scoop. Support-vector-machine (SVM) and supervised classification algorithm were applied over Landsat-8, RISAT-1 and Sentinel-1 data to classify these features. Surface patterns of snow and clouds were found in the continental icesheet, which becomes an obstacle to clearly extract sub-surface icesheet features in optical data. Therefore, to improve mapping of snow and ice features, high-resolution microwave data was also used. By comparing optical and microwave data, it was found that more sub-surface features could be mapped using microwave data. Further, RS was used to map the temporal change in the glacial features using two-year images for the austral summer of 2016 and 2017. It was found that diurnal as-well-as seasonal changes in surface ice features occur due to changes in local weather and can be mapped using temporal RS data.

J	Tokano, T				Tokano, Tetsuya			Latitudinal Distribution of Ethane Precipitation on Titan Modulated by Topography and Orbital Forcing and Its Implication for Titan's Surface Evolution	PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL												A general circulation model with geography constrained by Cassini is used to predict how ethane precipitation in Titan's lower stratosphere varies with latitude, season, and orbital forcing over the past 100 kyr. Ethane precipitation is generally more prevalent near the winter pole, where stratospheric ethane is transported downward toward the cold trap, and this general pattern is relatively insensitive to orbital parameter variations and geography. However, eccentricity-driven seasonal temperature variations modulate the seasonal asymmetry of ethane precipitation to some extent. The annual ethane precipitation does not monotonically increase from equator to pole but maximizes at selected sites, preferentially over empty deep basins such as Hagal Planitia. Local enhancement of ethane precipitation is caused by katabatic winds from plateau to basin and an associated regional-scale thermally direct circulation over the slope, which induces strong adiabatic cooling near the tropopause. The observed putative ethane clouds off the poles are evidence that ethane condensation is affected by topography. Preferential ethane precipitation over basins may increase the irregularity of Titan's shape by isostatic crustal subsidence after substitution of enclathrated methane by percolated ethane.

The higher station (Mt. Cimone, 2165m a.s.l.) is characterised by 360 degrees free horizon and is located on a rocky mountain while the lower (Ninfa lake, 1550m a.s.l.) is located inside the red spruce and beech forest. The different behaviour of CO2 at the two mountain stations has been registered. It shows the strong effect of nighttime soil emission and vegetation respiration on CO2 mixing ratio increases and of diurnal vegetative activity on CO2 concentration decreases at the lower measurement site. The baseline character of the higher measurement site has been confirmed by comparison of CO2 diurnal amplitudes recorded at the two stations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	SCHMIDT, U; CONRAD, R				SCHMIDT, U; CONRAD, R			HYDROGEN, CARBON-MONOXIDE, AND METHANE DYNAMICS IN LAKE CONSTANCE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The vertical distributions of dissolved H-2, CO, and CH4 and bacterial production (thymidine incorporation) were measured throughout 1987 in Lake Constance (Bodensee) and again in 1988 at a station in a small bight in the lake. Lake waters were supersaturated with respect to atmospheric H-2, CO, and CH4, especially in the epilimnion; concentrations in the surface water showed a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation with either autotrophic picoplankton, primary production, Chl a, pheophytin, or bacterial production. Dissolved H-2 and CO did not exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, but dissolved CH4 regularly increased during stratification and decreased in winter. Vertical profiles showed that surface maxima of CH4 were not due to diffusion from methanogenic profundal sediment. Lateral transects and epilimnetic mass balance indicated that CH4 may have originated from methanogenic littoral sediments along the shoreline and may also have been produced in oxic epilimnetic water by unknown processes. The water samples contained microbes able to oxidize H-2, CO, and CH4, but threshold concentrations required to sustain oxidation usually were higher than actual in situ concentrations of these gases. We therefore inferred that epilimnetic production of the gases was balanced by evasion to the atmosphere. With the stagnant film model, we determined that the mean residence times of the gases in the epilimniom were on the order of 2-16 d.																			0024-3590					SEP	1993	38	6					1214	1226		10.4319/lo.1993.38.6.1214	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.6.1214													WOS:A1993ME14700010

AGE AND GROWTH OF SPAWNING LONGNOSE GAR (LEPISOSTEUS OSSEUS) IN A NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS RESERVOIR	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												The longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus) is a primitive predaceous fish common throughout much of the east central United States, but research on its age and growth in lacustrine systems is rare. To characterize gar age and growth, I used bowfishing to collect spawning longnose gar in spring 2010 from littoral zones at Lake Arrowhead, Clay County, Texas. Females were older than males but significantly exceeded males in total length and mass when age was controlled. Von Bertalanffy growth curves suggested that males had faster growth rates, smaller maximum lengths, and shorter life spans than did females. However, females were always longer than males at any given age. Bowfishing capture beyond distances of 9 m was biased toward larger fish, bill the method was viable for collecting spawning longnose gar at close range. This study will assist fisheries managers and aquaculturists by providing growth-age relationships for longnose gar in a southern lacustrine system.																			1527-0904					APR	2012	72	1					69	77		10.3398/064.072.0108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3398/064.072.0108													WOS:000303139100008

In the benthos these species were most abundant at the sediment surface, at deeper sites and when the bottom water was oxygenated. In the plankton, in Priest Pot, they were found only in the O2 deficient summer hypolimnion. Experimental studies suggested that L. magnus and L. striatus required access to O2. Loxodes was apparently excluded from the oxygenated Priest Pot epilimnion by several adverse factors, one of which was bright light. The ecology of L. magnus and L. striatus resembles that of the advanced ciliates which were found associated with Loxodes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	72	1-2					131	158		10.1007/BF00016241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016241													WOS:A1980KE34800013

In the mid-latitude Mongolia Plateau, however, CH4 processes and fluxes have been less studied, particularly in riverine wetlands. In this study, in situ experiments were conducted in the riverine sandy wetlands of the Mongolia Plateau to gain a better understanding of CH4 emissions and their influencing mechanisms. Annual CH4 emissions were observed at 8.7 mg m(-2) h(-1) from the flowing water wetlands during November 2019 - October 2021, approximately 80% and 20% of which were emitted during the growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. In particular, CH4 emissions during the thawing period contributed < 5% to the annual total, contrary to the traditional idea that thawing plays an important role in annual CH4 emissions in boreal peatlands. CH4 emissions were significantly higher in the wetlands dominated by plant species than in that dominated by water body during the growing seasons; therefore, plant-mediated CH4 transport was explained as a favorable pathway for CH4 emissions from sandy soils to the atmosphere. Gene sequencing revealed differences in the phylogenies and taxonomies of methanogenic archaea and methanotrophs between the flowing and static water wetlands, suggesting that flowing water should bring oxygen and nutrients to microbial habitats and potentially affect the production, oxidation, and diffusion of CH4 in sandy wetlands.					王, WANGZHIPING/IZD-5413-2023; Machacova, Katerina/G-1603-2014; Han, Xingguo/K-7552-2016; Ang, li/J-6087-2012	Han, Xingguo/0000-0002-1836-975X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC 26	2024	197	1							105	10.1007/s10661-024-13488-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13488-z								39725800					WOS:001385343300009

Uniform Temperature Dependency in the Phenology of a Keystone Herbivore in Lakes of the Northern Hemisphere	PLOS ONE												Spring phenologies are advancing in many ecosystems associated with climate warming causing unpredictable changes in ecosystem functioning. Here we establish a phenological model for Daphnia, an aquatic keystone herbivore based on decadal data on water temperatures and the timing of Daphnia population maxima from Lake Constance, a large European lake. We tested this model with long-term time-series data from two lakes (Muggelsee, Germany; Lake Washington, USA), and with observations from a diverse set of 49 lakes/sites distributed widely across the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The model successfully captured the observed temporal variation of Daphnia phenology in the two case study sites (r(2) = 0.25 and 0.39 for Muggelsee and Lake Washington, respectively) and large-scale spatial variation in the NH (R-2 = 0.57). These results suggest that Daphnia phenology follows a uniform temperature dependency in NH lakes. Our approach - based on temperature phenologies - has large potential to study and predict phenologies of animal and plant populations across large latitudinal gradients in other ecosystems.

A.D. 1100) coincided with periods of abrupt, profound climate change, The timing and magnitude of climate changes are inferred from stratigraphic evidence of lake-level variation recorded in C-14-dated lake-sediment cores. Paleolake levels provide estimates of drainage basin water balance. Archaeological evidence establishes spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural field use and abandonment. Prior to 1500 B.C., aridity in the altiplano precluded intensive agriculture. During a wetter period from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 1100, the Tiwanaku civilization and its immediate predecessors developed specialized agricultural methods that stimulated population growth and sustained large human settlements, A prolonged drier period (ca. A.D. 1100-1400) caused declining agricultural production, field abandonment, and cultural collapse. (C) 1997 University of Washington.

Life history characters (body size of adults, egg diameter, egg sac length and breadth) of nineteen species of central European cyclopoid copepods were measured and sexual size dimorphism (adult female length x adult male length(-1)), relative egg size (egg weight x body weight(-1)), weight of adult females and of eggs, egg sac shape (egg sac length x egg sac breadth(-1)), and reproductive effort (clutch weight produced per female weight per day) were calculated to detect trends in life history strategies. 2. Typical planktonic species exhibited the lowest reproductive effort. Among planktonic species, the value for egg sac shape increased with clutch size. 3. Large species and small species exhibited different trends in life history characters. Large species had larger clutches, larger eggs, and a greater sex size dimorphism than small species. However, small species had a greater relative egg size. 4. Large species live in cold water and reproduce during the spring bloom of phytoplankton where the production of large clutches with relatively small eggs is advantageous. Reserves are unnecessary for juveniles because food is abundant. Small species generally are most abundant during the warm season, when conditions are less predictable, and relatively large eggs, possibly provided with reserves, are advantageous.																			0046-5070					FEB	1994	31	1					77	86		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00840.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1994.tb00840.x													WOS:A1994MV70100007

Detection and identification of lampreys in Great Lakes streams using environmental DNA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Control of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the Great Lakes requires accurate assessment of the instream distribution of this pest species and the ability to distinguish it from the four lamprey species that are native to the Great Lakes (American brook lamprey Lethenteron appendix, chestnut lamprey Ichthyomyzon castaneus, northern brook lamprey Ichthyomyzon fossor, and silver lamprey Ichthyomyzon unicuspis). We developed PCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays to distinguish among the four "genetic species" of Great Lakes lampreys (silver and northern brook lampreys were genetically indistinguishable), tested them under laboratory conditions, and demonstrated in the field that both spawning and larval sea lamprey can be detected using eDNA. In the laboratory, mean detection frequency decreased with increasing flow rate, but was not significantly related to larval density or temperature over the range of relatively high densities tested. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated in the field when sea lamprey eDNA was detected during the spawning season (when large-bodied adults, their gametes, and later their carcasses were present); sampling effort involved collection of three 1-2 L water samples at each of four transects (0.4-1.0 km apart). Mean detection frequency remained high (81-97%) until spawning ceased at the end of June, but decreased thereafter, falling to 6% by mid-August. We also demonstrated that eDNA of smaller, burrowing larvae (in water collected after mid-August) was detectable in two of four streams with medium to high larval density (1-2 larvae/m(2)), but not at low densities (<0.1 larvae/m(2)), potentially due to the exacerbating effect of high flow rates.

Community based fisheries management and fisher livelihoods: Bangladesh case studies	HUMAN ECOLOGY												Poor fishers in Bangladesh have been disadvantaged by policies that favored powerful people leasing fishing rights. Community-based management was expected to improve fisher access, livelihoods, and the sustainability of fisheries. The impacts of community management in three floodplain waterbodies differed according to the environment and property rights. Where a set of fishers jointly held exclusive rights to a small enclosed lake they increased production by stocking fish and shared the returns. This strategy is productive but attracts competition for profits and fish consumption was unchanged. Access to capture fisheries in floodplain waterbodies enables the poor to catch diverse small fish for their consumption. Yet sustainability requires limits on fishing. Fish sanctuaries were respected, yet catches per day fell when more people from several villages increased fishing effort in a large wetland, while a tightly knit community restored the fishery in a smaller floodplain. Community organizations will need recognition of their long-term use rights to overcome future threats.

In-home tests were standardized with paired samples of fish. Color of flesh, odor, flavor, texture and overall acceptability were recorded on a 9-point Hedonic scale. Sensory results indicated that brown trout raised in farm stock ponds were more acceptable than rainbow trout from similar environments, and rainbow trout from natural winter-kill lakes were more acceptable than brown trout from the same or similar lakes. Overall, we conclude that brown trout would be acceptable to consumers. Variations in acceptability related to water body of origin rather than to species of fish. Significant differences occurred in some characteristics but were inconsistent as to species.																			0022-1147					MAY-JUN	1992	57	3					572	574		10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb08045.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb08045.x													WOS:A1992HX82900009

Changes in the tree-ring anatomy of periodically flooded trees have allowed the reconstruction of historical floods in unregulated hydrological systems. In regulated rivers, the study of flood rings could recover past flood history, assuming that the effects of hydrological regulation on their production can be understood. This study analyzes the effect of regulation on the flood-ring occurrence (visual intensity and relative frequency) and on ring widths in Fraxinus nigra trees growing at five sites distributed along the Driftwood River floodplain. Driftwood River was regulated by a dam in 1917 that was replaced at the same location in 1953. Ring width revealed little, to no evidence, of the impact of river regulation, in contrast to the flood rings. Prior to 1917, high relative frequencies of well-defined flood rings were recorded during known flood years, as indicated by significant correlations with reconstructed spring discharge of the nearby Harricana River. After the construction and the replacement of the dam, relative frequencies of flood rings and their intensities gradually decreased. Flood-ring relative frequencies after 1917, and particularly after 1953, were mostly composed of weakly defined (less distinct) flood rings with some corresponding to known flood years and others likely reflecting dam management. The strength of the correlations with the instrumental Harricana River discharge also gradually decrease starting after 1917. Compared with upper floodplain trees, shoreline trees at each site recorded flood rings less frequently following the construction of the first but especially of the second dam, indicating that water level regulation limited flooding in the floodplains. Compared with the downstream site to the dam, the upstream ones recorded significantly more flood rings in the postdam period, reemphasizing the importance of considering the position of the site along with the river continuum and site conditions in relation to flood exposure. The results demonstrated that sampling trees in multiple riparian stands and along with various hydrological contexts at a far distance of the dams could help disentangle the flooding signal from the dam management signal.

Because of the huge number of potential organic and inorganic contaminants in water, we focused our study on common water quality variables and three ecological indices. In this study, we used the modified Carlson trophic status index, Shannon diversity index, and the phytoplankton functional group index to assess the changing ecological status of Zhushuqiao Reservoir, a drinking water source in central China. Stratified water sampling for abiotic and biotic variables was conducted bimonthly from April 2016 to February 2017. All three indices indicated that upper reservoir water quality and ecological condition were worse than those in the lower reservoir. Also, the dominant phytoplankton species in the upper reservoir differed significantly from those in the lower reservoir. The reservoir was eutrophic from June to October, especially in June. During the other months, it was mesotrophic, with the best water quality in winter. Water temperature was the main driver of seasonal changes in both biotic and abiotic indicators, although hydrological condition also affected water quality. Total phosphorus (TP) was the limiting factor for phytoplankton, but phytoplankton biomass increased greatly when both TP and total nitrogen increased. Each index had weaknesses; but applying all three together yielded a comprehensive ecological assessment of Zhushuqiao Reservoir and could do so for other similar reservoirs.

J	Michaloudi, E; Zarfdjian, M; Economidis, PS				Michaloudi, E; Zarfdjian, M; Economidis, PS			The zooplankton of Lake Mikri Prespa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A study from June 1990 to October 1992 revealed that the pelagic zooplankton community of Lake Mikri Prespa consists of 45 invertebrate species (28 Rotifera, 11 Cladocera, 6 Copepoda and 1 mollusc). It includes A. steindachneri, an endemic calanoid of the Western Balkans. Half of the species are first records for the lake. The total abundance and biomass ranged from 61 to 905 ind l(-1) and 58 to 646 mu g l(-1), respectively. Seasonal fluctuations agreed with the PEG-model. Copepods prevailed throughout the year. The species composition and seasonal variability were affected by temperature-dependent food conditions, competition and predation. These factors induced a seasonal succession which involved a replacement of larger species or individuals by smaller ones during summer. The cladoceran population, as a whole, was characterised by small size classes of the species present, probably due to fish predation. An examination of the horizontal distribution showed that, although seasonal variability was the same at all stations sampled, the central station showed higher abundance. Inshore-offshore diel migrations of juvenile fish is considered to account for this uneven distribution. Shannon's diversity index ranged from 0.98 to 2.95 and evenness from 0.3 to 0.9. Both were influenced by temperature.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; 													0018-8158					AUG 22	1997	351						77	94		10.1023/A:1003008306292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003008306292													WOS:A1997YG80000007

It was calculated that 98,000-162,000 waterbirds are killed annually. The number of people practicing these activities is estimated at < 2000 in a population of 35,000-40,000 fishermen. The majority of the birds are taken by < 100 men. Compared with 1930 about 30-50% fewer duck and coot are sold. This decrease is mainly caused by the decrease in numbers of pochard and tufted duck. Hunting pressure on waders was extremely high. The contribution of these activities to the regional economy is reviewed and is insignificant. A number of conservation measures are recommended.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1983	27	1					23	43		10.1016/0006-3207(83)90004-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(83)90004-6													WOS:A1983RB89000003

Prelude to the extinction: Revision of the Achchagyi-Allaikha and Berelyokh mass accumulations of mammoth	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The little known Achchagyi-Allaikha mass assemblage of mammoths and the well-known Berelyokh site (Lower Indigirka River, Arctic Siberia) were studied. Detailed study of the Achchagyi-Allaikha site provided ample data concerning its geology, stratigraphy, taphonomy, and the gender-age structure of the taphocoenosis. The Achchagyi-Allaikha assemblage included redeposited bones from numerous young (not less than 21) and some adult female mammoths, with limited quantities of Bison. Equus and Rangifer bones. Collagen from mammoth bones preserved at the Achchagyi-Allaikha site (n = 6) was radiocarbon-dated at 12,490 +/- 80 to 12,400 +/- 60 BP. At the Berelyokh site, eight mammoth bones were radiocarbon-dated at 12,720 +/- 100 to 11,900 +/- 50 BP, one bison bone was dated at 12,380 +/- 150 BP, and one mammoth bone dated at 36,500 +/- 1000 (redeposited bone included in younger sediments). The mass accumulations are synchronous and are similar in their mode of formation. The assemblage of mammoths in the Achchagyi-Allaikha and Berelyokh sites resulted from simultaneous deaths of a large number of animals (probably herd-family groups) in one or several seasons. It is very probable that the deposits in both cases were not of cultural origin. The formation of the burials is a direct consequence of short but strong climatic warming (Bolling Oscillation) that resulted in many unfavorable environmental conditions. Among these, the increase of snow cover and stronger spring floods were very notable. Belling warming is a model of the large-scale Holocene event. Mass death of mammoths during the Belling phase was a prelude to their final extinction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Xiao, X; Pei, M; Liu, X; Zhao, Y; Liang, YT				Xiao, Xian; Pei, Meng; Liu, Xiang; Zhao, Yuan; Liang, Yuting			Planktonic algal bloom significantly alters sediment bacterial community structure	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose We determined the relationship of a planktonic algal bloom with spatial and temporal changes in sediment bacterial communities in a eutrophic urban river in the Taihu Basin, China. Materials and methods Surface sediments from different locations on the river, including with and without an algal bloom, were collected monthly for 1 year. Sediment bacterial communities were assessed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons using an Illumina MiSeq. Results and discussion There were distinct spatial and temporal changes in sediment bacterial community structure. Significant decrease in the Shannon diversity corresponded with the peak chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla throughout the year; however, their relative abundances changed seasonally. At the time of peak Chl a concentrations, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes comprised a greater proportion of the bacterial community. Bacterial community structure also varied spatially at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level according to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), especially in locations with an algal bloom compared with those without an algal bloom. There were positive correlations between multiple bacterial genera and Chl a content, suggesting the potential for facilitative relationships between phytoplankton and bacteria. Based on the CCA, water temperature, NH4+-N, TN, NO3--N, and TP in the sediment and Chl a contents in the water column were significantly correlated with sediment bacterial community structure (P < 0.05). Conclusions Planktonic algal blooms may influence sediment bacterial community structure at all taxonomic levels in urban rivers. This work emphasizes the need for more comprehensive studies regarding the impact of planktonic algal blooms on sediment bacterial communities.

Temperature inversions and air quality in the Cantabrian mountains: a case study of the Campoo valley	INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN												Temperature inversions are a common meteorological phenomenon in mountainous areas whereby a warm air mass is superimposed on a cold air mass. The cold air pool (CAP) causes, among other effects, the accumulation of pollutants near their emission sources. This study analyses the main features of these events in Campoo, a mountain valley in northern Spain, and assesses their influence on local air quality. These events occur throughout the year but are stronger and more persistent in the winter months, characterised by a pronounced daily cycle of temperature and humidity, clear skies and a thin boundary layer. Winds show a weak upward circulation during the day and a downward circulation at night. Due to the strong atmospheric stability, NO2 and PM10 levels increase while the reduction of O3 is compensated by photochemical processes as the warm season progresses. The local origin of these compounds determines that their temporal evolution is subject to variations in human activity, as demonstrated by a "weekend effect" and an improvement in air quality after the COVID-19 pandemic.																			0213-4691	1989-9890					2025		83								10.14198/INGEO.27738	http://dx.doi.org/10.14198/INGEO.27738													WOS:001438635900002

A total of 93 specimens of R. arenarum (adults sexually mature) were captured during the spring. From the analysis of cell, no variations were found in terms of morphology, whereas in nuclear and cell areas and Price-Jones curves, we observed a smaller size in erythrocytes of individuals inhabiting the site most altered, "Villa Dalcar," as well as for leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils for the same site. This could be caused by presence of different pollutants in the lake. Furthermore, this was confirmed by the high levels of environmental variables (conductivity, total dissolved solids, and salinity) show that Villa Dalcar is the site most affected by human activities.

We estimated that up to 81% of the entire age-0 population in the lake system inhabited the streams by midsummer. Some age-0 fish overwintered in the streams and remained there during their second summer. Such behavior suggested fitness advantages were gained by stream residence. The inhabited streams had accessible, cold, and stable habitats that existed because the streams occurred in forested catchments where groundwater dominated base flows. This identification of these small streams as habitat for young brook trout and the importance of catchment hydrology for sustaining these habitats indicated a need to review habitat protection guidelines for lake-dwelling populations.					; Noakes, David/C-9113-2011; Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020	Curry, R.

Widespread variability in overnight patterns of ecosystem respiration linked to gradients in dissolved organic matter, residence time, and productivity in a global set of lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We characterized patterns of nighttime ecosystem respiration (ER) in 23 globally-distributed lakes using free-water changes in dissolved oxygen (DO). We considered three alternative models of ER to describe overnight changes in DO: constant ER, linearly declining ER, or logistically declining ER. Variation in ER was widespread. Each model of respiration was found to best fit observed overnight DO dynamics with some degree of frequency in every lake. Constant ER occurred with an average frequency of 62% across lakes and was most commonly the best description of DO dynamics. It never occurred with a frequency < 19% in any lake and ranged up to 90% in one dystrophic lake. The average frequency across lakes with which the linear and logistic models occurred was 21% and 17%, respectively, although they ranged as low as 3% and as high as 42% in some lakes. Although data limitations restricted the majority of our analysis to summer months, annual data records from five lakes suggest there is little seasonal variation in the frequency with which patterns occurred. As our conceptual model predicted, the frequency of constant ER among lakes increased and logistic ER decreased along a gradient of increasing terrestrial influence. However, despite significant correlations with total phosphorus and photosynthetically active radiation, the effect of lake productivity on the frequency of patterns of ER among lakes was less clear. This study suggests that diel variability in ER results from complex interactions between different components of respiration and the forcing factors that govern them.

J	Fisher, MM; Graham, JM; Graham, LE				Fisher, MM; Graham, JM; Graham, LE			Bacterial abundance and activity across sites within two northern Wisconsin Sphagnum bogs	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterial abundance, temperature, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration were compared across surface sites within and between two northern Wisconsin Sphagnum peatlands over the summer seasons in 1995 and 1996. Sites of interest were the Sphagnum mat surface, the water-filled moat (lagg) at the bug margin, and the bog lake littoral zone. Significant differences in both bacterial populations and water chemistry were observed between sites. pH was highest in the lake and lowest in the mat at both bugs; the opposite was true for DOG. Large populations of bacteria were present in surface interstitial water from the mat; abundance in this site was consistently higher than in the moat or lake. Bacterial abundance also increased across sites of increasing DOC concentration and declining pH. Bacterial activities (rates of [H-3]leucine incorporation) and growth in dilution cultures (with grazers removed) were also assessed in lake, moat, and mat sites. Results using these measures generally supported the trends observed in abundance, although high rates of [H-3]leucine incorporation were recorded in the moat at one of the bogs. Our results indicate that bacterial populations in Sphagnum peatlands are not adversely affected by acidity, and that DOC may be more important than pH in determining bacterial abundance in these environments.																			0095-3628					NOV-DEC	1998	36	3					259	269		10.1007/s002489900113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002489900113								9852506					WOS:000077586800005

Lanthanide rarity in natural waters: implications for microbial C1 metabolism	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS												Research in the last decade has illuminated the important role that lanthanides play in microbial carbon metabolism, particularly methylotrophy. Environmental omics studies have revealed that lanthoenzymes are dominant in some environments, and laboratory studies have shown that lanthoenzymes are favored over their calcium-containing counterparts even when calcium is far more abundant. Lanthanide elements are common in rocks but occur at exceedingly low levels in most natural waters (picomolar to nanomolar range) with the exception of volcanic hot springs, which can reach micromolar concentrations. Calcium is orders of magnitude higher in abundance than lanthanide elements across natural settings. Bacteria that use lanthanides for growth on simple carbon compounds (e.g. methanol and ethanol) grow optimally at micromolar concentrations. It is highly likely that bacteria in the environment have evolved specialized lanthanide sequestration and high-affinity uptake systems to overcome lanthanide deprivation. Indeed, we identified genes in soil metagenomes encoding the lanthanide-binding protein lanmodulin, which may be important for cellular differentiation between calcium and lanthanides. More research is needed on microbial adaptations to lanthanide scarcity.

Often, adult carp migrate between lakes and marshes (spawning grounds) in early spring in large synchronized events. If these fish could be directed into traps, sustainable carp management schemes could be developed for many lake-marsh systems. In this study, we used a portable low-voltage electric guidance system (EGS) to direct common carp into a mock trap in a relatively large natural stream. The system was tested on 6 occasions: 3 days with EGS off and 3 days with EGS on. Approximately 40 adult carp were used in each test. All were implanted with passive integrated transponders (PIT) and ten in each group also had visual markers. When the EGS was on, PIT data indicated that 74% of the carp were successfully guided into the mock trap, while visual markers indicated that no carp were able to cross through the EGS despite over 300 attempts. When the EGS was off, PIT data indicated that only 18% of carp swam into the mock trap, and visual markers showed that many were able to swim though the EGS (22 out of 29). The electric field generated by the EGS was mild and did not cause fish paralysis. The EGS required little on-site engineering and was deployed in 2 days. This new type of EGS might prove useful for managing invasive fish or for conservation of native species that employ seasonal migrations.																			1989-8649					SEP	2018	9	3					291	297		10.3391/mbi.2018.9.3.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2018.9.3.11													WOS:000444796900011

Most of NW Iran is located in a volcanic arc zone of Cenozoic age, including the Quaternary. The subduction of the Neo-Tethys ocean floor beneath the central block of Iran during the Cenozoic resulted in the formation of this zone. This geological setting has provided NW Iran with diverse natural geological features of high significance. Some of the main geological features include the Sahand Volcano, the Urmia Lake, salt deposits, travertine deposits, springs, limestone caves, tectonic structures and Cenozoic vertebrate fossils. This exceptional geodiversity together with the rich cultural heritage provides a valuable base for geotourism and geopark development, which is needed to diversify local economy and strengthen rural development. However, for tourism to be successful and sustainable, the planning and management must be based on up-to-date knowledge and understanding of the tourism resources, as well as on a holistic overview of the many facets of the geological and cultural heritage.

Seasonal variation and interaction of photodegradation and microbial metabolism of DOC in black water Amazonian ecosystems	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Photodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can generate labile substrates readily available for microbial consumption, thus increasing DOC removal, especially in fresh water humic ecosystems. While a few studies have evaluated the effects of sunlight on DOC removal and CO2 production in aquatic environments, none have investigated the seasonal variation and interaction of photodegradation and microbial metabolism of DOC in a large tropical black-water river system. We present the results of experiments designed to evaluate the rates of photodegradation and subsequent microbial metabolism of DOC in the Negro River and an associated floodplain lake (Lake Tupe) in the central Brazilian Amazon Basin. Water samples collected in both environments at different phases of the river hydrological cycle were filtered and exposed to natural sunlight to estimate photodegradation; they were then inoculated with natural bacteria and incubated in the dark to evaluate bacterial metabolism. Changes in incident solar radiation and in DOC concentration and quality throughout the hydrological cycle directly affected the DOC photodegradation rates and microbial metabolism. Total DOC mineralization (photodegradation plus bacterial consumption) was more intense in the falling water period. DOC photodegradation generally stimulated further microbial DOC degradation, enhancing total DOC removal in samples exposed to solar radiation in both ecosystems. While direct photodegradation represented only a small part of the total DOC mineralization (6.7 % in the high water period in the Negro River), the combined effect of photodegradation and stimulus of bacterial metabolism could account for a significant part of the CO2 production in Amazonian black water ecosystems.

We investigated the influence of two key environmental factors, temperature and NO3- availability, on N2O emission from larvae of Chironomus plumosus in field and laboratory experiments. Larvae collected from lake sediments emitted between 2 and 73 pmol N2O ind.(-1) h(-1) during the warm season, but took up maximally -27 pmol N2O ind.(-1) h(-1) during winter. Larvae kept in laboratory microcosms emitted between 14 and 122 pmol N2O ind.(-1) h(-1), and N2O uptake was never observed. For both types of larvae, the rate of N2O emission was stimulated by temperature (when the NO3- concentration in the water column was higher than 25-50 mu mol L-1) and by NO3- (when the temperature was higher than 4-10 degrees C). Modeling based on experimentally determined ventilation parameters and sedimentary O-2 and NO3- turnover rates predicted that NO3- concentrations inside the burrow and in the sediment surrounding the burrow fluctuated and were on average lower than those in the water column. In contrast, NO3- concentrations measured in the gut and hemolymph of the microcosm-incubated larvae were at least as high as in the water column. This suggests that N2O emission from C. plumosus larvae is controlled by NO3- availability in the water column, but is decoupled, by a hitherto unknown mechanism, from NO3- present in the immediate surroundings of the larva.

J	GREEN, J				GREEN, J			ZOOPLANKTON ASSOCIATIONS IN EAST-AFRICAN LAKES SPANNING A WIDE SALINITY RANGE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The zooplankton of 38 East African lakes has been analysed in terms of species richness and dominance. The conductivities of the lakes range from 48 to 72 500 muS cm-1 20-degrees-C. The lakes generally contain more species of rotifers than either Copepoda or Cladocera. The number of species of rotifers begins to decline at a conductivity below 1000 muS cm-1, and falls to 2 or 3 species above 3000 muS cm-1. Similar reductions occur in the Copepoda and Cladocera. Many species can be dominant at conductivities below 1000 muS cm-1, but the range is restricted progressively with increasing salinity. The dominant species of Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera change independently along the salinity gradient, but there are indications of interactions and modifications of community structure by predation and competition.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					249	256		10.1007/BF00018806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018806													WOS:A1993MB13700020

The amounts of sexual and asexual reproduction differ within some species relying on geographic location and environmental factors. Here, we studied the reproductive strategies of different geographic Zostera japonica populations, S1 and S2 at Swan Lake lagoon (SLL), and H1 and H2 at Huiquan Bay (HQB), in northern China. The duration of flowering at SLL was longer than at HQB, whereas flowering initiation at HQB occurred earlier than at SLL. In addition, the timing of seed maturation at HQB occurred earlier than at SLL. The allocation to sexual reproduction at SLL was greater than at HQB. The maximum potential seed production was greatest at S1 (22228.52 +/- 8832.46 seeds.m(-2)), followed by S2 (21630.34 +/- 9378.67 seeds.m(-2)), H2 (7459.60 +/- 1779.33 seeds.m(-2)), and H1 (2821.05 +/- 1280.57 seeds.m(-2)). The seasonal changes in total shoot density and biomass were small at HQB. There was a relatively large number of overwintering shoots at HQB because of the higher average temperature during winter. The allocation to sexual reproduction was lower than at SLL, and no seedlings were observed at HQB during our study. Thus, the population of Z. japonica at HQB was maintained by asexual reproduction. Compared with HQB, the biomass of overwintering shoots at SLL was less than 30 g dry weight.m(-2). The Z. japonica at SLL relied on asexual and sexual reproduction to maintain the population. The results show the necessity of understanding local reproductive strategies before starting restoration and management projects. The study provides fundamental information and guidance for the conservation and restoration of seagrass beds.

J	Zhou, ZF; Liu, K; Wang, XR; Huang, SH				Zhou, ZF; Liu, K; Wang, XR; Huang, SH			Characteristics of PM2.5 in rural areas of southern Jiangsu Province, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												To understand pollution level and possible sources of atmospheric fine particulates in rural areas of southern Jiangsu Province of China, samples of PM, were collected and analyzed in Xueyan Town and Taihu Lake Station over three seasons from July 2002 to January 2003. The mass concentrations of PM2.5 and 14 principal component elements were obtained. The results showed that pollution of PM2.5 was serious and the concentration levels of S, Zn, Pb and As were similar to city. There are different seasonal distribution laws of pollutant elements in PM2.5 between two sampling sites, probably due to contribution of local sources, medium or long distance transportation of fine particulates and complicated meteorological conditions. The enrichment levels of S, Zn, Pb, As, K were high, reflecting the influence of anthropogenic activities. Particularly enrichment level of S was much higher in summer, which was probably related to meteorological condition. The result of principal components analysis showed major sources of PM2.5 included crustal resuspension, coal burning, metal processing industry or waste incineration, vehicular emission, which suggests anthropogenic activities is of important influence on PM2.5 in rural areas of southern Jiangsu Province.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2005	17	6					977	980											16465890					WOS:000233402200020

Like most cyanobacteria, L wollei produce toxins, named lyngbyatoxin (LYNGTX), an analog of saxitoxin. In order to verify the neurotoxic potential of these filamentous cyanobacteria, we collected amphipods within local vegetation at three sites in summer months: a site rich in L wollei (Lake St-Louis [LSL]) and two urban sites composed of macrophytes but devoid of L wollei mats (Richelieu River [RICH] and L'Assomption River [ASSO] outlets). The body weight of each amphipod was measured, and the neurotoxicity was estimated with the measurement of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) activities. Levels of protein-bound phosphates were also evaluated, to rule out contamination by Microcystis sp. The results showed that the activity of acetylcholinesterase measured in amphipods in ASSO and RICH was lower than the activity found in amphipods collected in L wollei mats in LSL. In addition, amphipods found in L wollei mats at the LSL site have significantly higher GST activity than those located at the two devoid sites, RICH and ASSO. No significant change was observed for protein-bound phosphate levels. This study suggests that the presence of L wollei triggers potential toxicity.

Decadal declines in avian herbivore reproduction: density-dependent nutrition and phenological mismatch in the Arctic	ECOLOGY												A full understanding of population dynamics depends not only on estimation of mechanistic contributions of recruitment and survival, but also knowledge about the ecological processes that drive each of these vital rates. The process of recruitment in particular may be protracted over several years, and can depend on numerous ecological complexities until sexually mature adulthood is attained. We addressed long-term declines (23 breeding seasons, 1992-2014) in the per capita production of young by both Ross's Geese (Chen rossii) and Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) nesting at Karrak Lake in Canada's central Arctic. During this period, there was a contemporaneous increase from 0.4 to 1.1 million adults nesting at this colony. We evaluated whether (1) density-dependent nutritional deficiencies of pre-breeding females or (2) phenological mismatch between peak gosling hatch and peak forage quality, inferred from NDVI on the brood-rearing areas, may have been behind decadal declines in the per capita production of goslings. We found that, in years when pre-breeding females arrived to the nesting grounds with diminished nutrient reserves, the proportional composition of young during brood-rearing was reduced for both species. Furthermore, increased mismatch between peak gosling hatch and peak forage quality contributed additively to further declines in gosling production, in addition to declines caused by delayed nesting with associated subsequent negative effects on clutch size and nest success. The degree of mismatch increased over the course of our study because of advanced vegetation phenology without a corresponding advance in Goose nesting phenology. Vegetation phenology was significantly earlier in years with warm surface air temperatures measured in spring (i.e., 25 May-30 June). We suggest that both increased phenological mismatch and reduced nutritional condition of arriving females were behind declines in population-level recruitment, leading to the recent attenuation in population growth of Snow Geese.					; Douglas, David/AAU-1087-2021	Ross, Megan/0000-0001-8926-4464; Alisauskas, Ray/0000-0003-1983-020X; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104													0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	2017	98	7					1869	1883		10.1002/ecy.1856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1856								28403519					WOS:000404875100014

CURRENT STATUS OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR POPULATION DYNAMICS OF PRYMNESIUM PARVUM IN A TEXAS RESERVOIR	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Blooms of the harmful alga Prymnesium parvum have apparently increased in frequency in inland waters of the United States, especially in western Texas. A suite of mathematical models was developed based on a chemostat (or continuously stirred tank reactor) framework, and calibrated with data from Lake Granbury, Texas. Inputs included data on flows, salinity, irradiance, temperature, zooplankton grazing, and nutrients. Parameterization incorporated recent laboratory studies relating the specific growth rate of P. parvum to such factors. Models differed in the number of algal populations competing with P. parvum, and whether competition occurred only by consumption of shared nutrients, or additionally through production of an allelopathic chemical by one of the populations, parameterized as cyanobacteria. Uncalibrated models did not reproduce the observed seasonal dynamics of P. parvum in Lake Granbury, which displayed a maximum population in late February during a prolonged bloom in cooler weather, and reduced abundance in summer. Sensitivity analyses suggested two modifications leading to predictions that better resembled observations. The first modification greatly reduces the optimal temperature for growth of P. parvum, an approach that disagrees with laboratory experiments indicating a strong potential for growth at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The second modification increases the growth rate of P. parvum at all temperatures, in models including cyanobacterial allelopathy. Despite these adjustments, calibrated models did not faithfully simulate all features of the seasonal dynamics of P. parvum.

They were obtained from the FIMR database. Data on ice parameters for the four largest southern Baltic coastal lakes: Jamno, Bukowo, Gardno and Lebsko, and for Szczecin, Puck, and Vistula Lagoons, come from the Maritime Branch of Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute (in Polish: Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Panstwowy Instytut Badawczy, IMGW-PIB) in Gdynia. The time series for the lakes cover the years from 1960 to 2018, and for the lagoons - from 1946 to 2018. Three ice parameters were selected for this study: the number of days with ice, the duration of the ice season and the maximum ice thickness for a given winter. Relationships between the selected ice parameters for the studied basins and the MIB were examined using correlation and regression methods. Correlations between the MIB and values of the ice parameters for the lakes and the southern Baltic coastal lagoons do not differ significantly. Considerable differences are observed amongst the correlation coefficients for individual ice parameters and the MIB. Larger differences are found in relationships between the values of individual ice parameters in the sheltered basins and the MIB. The strongest correlation with the MIB is observed for the maximum ice thickness and the number of days with ice.																			1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2020	49	3					291	303		10.1515/ohs-2020-0026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2020-0026													WOS:000573304600008

Ecosystem responses to increased precipitation and permafrost decay in subarctic Sweden inferred from peat and lake sediments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Recent accelerated decay of discontinuous permafrost at the Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden has been attributed to increased temperature and snow depth, and has caused expansion of wet minerotrophic areas leading to significant changes in carbon cycling in the mire. In order to track these changes through time and evaluate potential forcing mechanisms, this paper analyses a peat succession and a lake sediment sequence from within the mire, providing a record for the last 100 years, and compares these with monitored climate and active layer thickness data. The peat core was analysed for testate amoebae to reconstruct changes in peatland surface moisture conditions and water table fluctuations. The lake sediment core was analysed by near infrared spectroscopy to infer changes in the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of the lake-water, and changes in delta C-13 and C, N and delta N-15 to track changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool and the influence of diagenetic effects on sediment organic matter, respectively. Results showed that major shifts towards increased peat surface moisture and TOC concentration of the lake-water occurred around 1980, one to two decades earlier than a temperature driven increase in active layer thickness. Comparison with monitored temperature and precipitation from a nearby climate station indicates that this change in peat surface moisture is related to June-September (JJAS) precipitation and that the increase in lake-water TOC concentration reflects an increase in total annual precipitation. A significant depletion in C-13 of sediment organic matter in the early 1980s probably reflects the effect of a single or a few consecutive years with anomalously high summer precipitation, resulting in elevated DIC content of the lake water, predominantly originating from increased export and subsequent respiration of organic carbon from the mire. Based on these results, it was not possible to link proxy data obtained on peat and lake-sediment records directly to permafrost decay. Instead our data indicate that increased precipitation and anomalously high rainfall during summers had a significant impact on the mire and the adjacent lake ecosystem. We therefore propose that effects of increased precipitation should be considered when evaluating potential forcing mechanisms of recent changes in carbon cycling in the subarctic.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008; Jonasson, Charlotte/JVO-4891-2024; Callaghan, Terens/N-7640-2014	Forster, Johannes/0000-0003-0174-926X; Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; Jonasson, Charlotte/0000-0003-1247-3377; Christensen, Torben R./0000-0002-4917-148X													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2009	15	7					1652	1663		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01880.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01880.x													WOS:000266700000005

In today's world, organizations recognize the vital role of data in modern business intelligence systems for making meaningful decisions and staying competitive in the field. Efficient and optimal data analytics provides a competitive edge to its performance and services. Major organizations generate, collect and process vast amounts of data, falling under the category of big data. Managing and analyzing the sheer volume and variety of big data is a cumbersome process. At the same time, proper utilization of the vast collection of an organization's information can generate meaningful insights into business tactics. In this regard, two of the popular data management systems in the area of big data analytics (i.e., data warehouse and data lake) act as platforms to accumulate the big data generated and used by organizations. Although seemingly similar, both of them differ in terms of their characteristics and applications. This article presents a detailed overview of the roles of data warehouses and data lakes in modern enterprise data management. We detail the definitions, characteristics and related works for the respective data management frameworks. Furthermore, we explain the architecture and design considerations of the current state of the art.

Vegetation graded from Carex meadow to Typha to Scirpus emergent zones along each of the 50-m transects. Abundant growth of cyanobacteria occurred on exposed soil surfaces and epiphytically below the water line in the emergent zones. The Carex meadow exhibited relatively low and variable rates of acetylene reduction, whereas the Typha and Scirpus zones had consistently high rates of activity. Estimated mean nitrogen influx rates (kg ha-1 yr-1) for the 1981 and 1982 seasons were consistently higher at Goose Lake (Carex, 0.5; Typha, 10.1-43.8; Scirpus 8.5-13.5) compared to Island Lake (Carex, 0.1; Typha, 0.9-10.6; Scirpus, 2.9-5.7). The higher rates of activity at the Goose Lake site are most likely due to the alkaline pH which is considered to favor cyanobacteria. The expansive wet meadow-emergent zones bordering the typically shallow Sandhills lakes support microbial populations which contribute large amounts of biologically fixed nitrogen to these aquatic ecosystems.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	1988	120	2					398	404		10.2307/2426012	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426012													WOS:A1988T314600019

Jake			Uncoupling indicators of water quality due to the invasive zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Cultural eutrophication of lakes due to excess loading of nutrients is a global problem affecting the provisioning of freshwater ecosystem services. Lake water quality is often described by trophic state indicators such as water clarity or concentrations of nutrients, chlorophyll, and cyanobacteria toxins. While these indicators are widely assumed to covary, capturing the same basic aspects of water quality, they can be uncoupled by changes in lake food webs. Outbreak of the invasive predatory zooplankton, Bythotrephes longimanus, in Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin (U.S.A.) in 2009 led to a decline in the herbivore, Daphnia pulicaria, and in turn, water clarity. We use 20-yr datasets for Lakes Mendota and Monona to evaluate interactions among nutrients, zooplankton, and phytoplankton that resulted in this trophic cascade. After invasion, diatoms increased in both lakes resulting in reduced water clarity, whereas cyanobacteria did not change in either lake. Multivariate time series analysis revealed that D. pulicaria grazing controlled edible diatoms in both lakes. Cyanobacteria biomass was positively associated with both D. pulicaria and summer nutrient concentrations. These results further clarify the limitations of top-down control in eutrophic lakes: grazing by zooplankton can control edible phytoplankton taxa, but largely inedible cyanobacteria may be more limited by nutrient concentrations. Accordingly, despite declining clarity in Lake Mendota, the number of beach closures due to cyanobacteria blooms declined following Bythotrephes invasion. Our study reveals how these two indicators of water quality-water clarity and cyanobacteria blooms-can become uncoupled during a food web shift.

Traditional analytical models provide valuable insights but often fall short of capturing the complex spatiotemporal interactions necessary for effective water management on a large scale. To address this gap, we develop a hybrid deep learning model for predicting water inundation frequency, integrating Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. This design enables the model to capture both temporal dependencies and spatial correlations governing inundation processes. Applied to the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYR), the model achieves high predictive accuracy and supports scenario-based simulations of agricultural and urban impacts. Results show that intensified agriculture dominates inundation changes across 46.6% of the basin, driving a 4.5% average decline in inundation frequency over a decade-particularly in seasonal water bodies with baseline frequencies of 45-50%. In contrast, urbanization primarily affects permanent water bodies but with weaker overall impacts. By linking data-driven forecasting with scenario analysis, this framework provides critical insights into how intensified human activities may alter water regimes over time, offering a robust scientific basis for managing aquatic environments amid evolving climate and land use conditions.

J	Lünterbusch, CH; Daniëls, FJA				Lünterbusch, CH; Daniëls, FJA			Phytosociological aspects of Dryas integrifolia vegetation on moist-wet soil in Northwest Greenland	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												This paper deals with the results of a phytosociological study according to the Braun-Blanquet approach of Dryas integrifolia vegetation on moist-wet soil in the Uummannaq District, Northwest Greenland. Soil chemical analyses comprise pH, conductivity, C/N-ratio and content of organic material, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ and phosphate (mg/100g soil). Based on 49 releves two associations and one community are distinguished, which were firstly described from the east coast of Greenland and so far only known from East Greenland. The Rhododendro-Vaccinietum microphylli Daniels 1982 occurs on moist soil. A subass. campylietosum stellati nov. occurs mainly along lakes and rivulets and a subass. sphaerophoretosum globosi nov. is restricted to moist soil which dries out in summer. A north-western vicariant of the Saxifrago-Kobresietum simpliciusculae Daniels & Fredskild in Fredskild 1998 mainly occurs on wet soil. A subass. ochrolechietosum frigidae nov. occurs on soil which partly dries out in summer and a subass. eriophoretosum angustifolii nov. occurs on permanent wet soil. An Eriophorum angustifolium-Rhododendron lapponicum community is confined to wet calcium- and magnesium-rich soil with permanent water supply. Literature research shows, that all vegetation types can be considered widespread in most parts of Greenland. Multivariate analyses (DECORANA and CANOCO) confirm the vegetation typology and the decisive differential role of soil moisture conditions between the vegetation types, just as do the results of a transect study along a soil moisture gradient. The vegetation types are classified within a new hygrophytic-mesophytic Rhododendrenion lapponici suballiance of the alliance Dryadion integrifoliae Ohba ex Daniels 1982, order Kobresio-Dryadetalia (Br.-Bl. 1948) Ohba 1974, class Carici-Kobresietea Ohba 1974. The synecological conception of the Dryadion integrifoliae and floristical differentiation against Caricion atrofusco-saxatilis vegetation (Caricetalia davallianae Br.-Bl. 1949, Scheuchzerio-Caricetea (Nordh. 1937) R. Tx. 1943) are reconsidered and stated more precisely. The high species richness of Rhododendro-Vaccinietum vegetation stands with a mean species number of 65 and 70 per plot of respectively 4 m(2) and 0.16 m(2) is discussed.																			0340-269X					JUN 29	2004	34	2					241	270		10.1127/0340-269X/2004/0034-0241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0340-269X/2004/0034-0241													WOS:000222395200003

Twelve C-14 dates determined on organic-rich bulk samples establish a chronological sequence for this core and yield a bottom age of similar to 16,000 cal years BP. Multiproxies including dry bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, organic carbon isotope, median grain size, silt-size fraction and total organic matter content were used to study variations of precipitation in relation to the East Asian monsoon. The core sediments are characterized by shifts between the lacustrine sediments and marshy sediments, implying hydrological variations between expansion and shrinkage of the water body in the swamp, and suggesting relatively wetter and drier conditions, respectively. Two relatively wetter episodes lasting from similar to 15,000 to 14,000 cal years BP and from similar to 13,500 to 12,800 cal years BP were revealed, possibly corresponding to the Bolling and the Allerod warming events, and three relatively drier phases occurred between similar to 16,000 and 15,000 cal years BP, between similar to 14,000 and 13,500 cal years BP and between similar to 12,800 and 11,500 cal years BP. The three events synchronize with the Oldest Dryas, the Older Dryas and the Younger Dryas cooling events, respectively. A distinctly humid period lasted from similar to 10,000 to 6,000 cal years BP in the early- and mid- Holocene was interpreted as the Holocene Optimum period. Several short dry events were revealed, including the most pronounced one at similar to 8,100 cal years BP that coincides with the "8,200 year" cooling event. Multiproxies indicate an evidently dry climate prevailing in the mid-Holocene (from similar to 6,000 to 3,000 cal years BP), reflecting a weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon. The general trend of Holocene climate shows agreement with the 25A degrees N summer solar insolation, suggesting that the orbitally induced insolation have played a key role in the Holocene climate in south China.

J	Lowe, TP; Day, DD				Lowe, TP; Day, DD			Metal concentrations in zebra mussels and sediments from embayments and riverine environments of Eastern Lake Erie, Southern Lake Ontario, and the Niagara River	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Concentrations of 14 metals were studied in the soft tissues of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and sediments from 16 Great Lakes embayments and riverine environments. Samples were collected in 1993 and 1994 during the early and late autumn period when the body mass of mussels is least affected by reproductive activities. There was a significant difference in geometric mean concentrations of all metals except Cu in mussels sampled from different sites, and there was a significant difference in the geometric mean concentrations of all metals but Cd, Mn, and Zn between years. The higher metal concentrations in mussels from this study were generally similar to those in mussels from contaminated European and U.S. locations, and those with lower concentrations were similar to those from uncontaminated European and U.S. locations. Geometric mean sediment concentrations of all metals differed significantly among sites. Sediment concentrations of metals from some sites were above EPA guidelines for moderately polluted harbor sediments. Sites where zebra mussels had higher concentrations of Al, Cr, and V tended to be the same sites as those where sediment concentrations of these metals were also higher. However, there was not a significant statistical relationship between concentrations of metals in zebra mussels and sediments, except for Mg.																			0090-4341					OCT	2002	43	3					301	308		10.1007/s00244-002-1176-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-002-1176-5								12202926					WOS:000177871800008

This study proposes a novel multi-scale analytical framework that combines spatio-temporal analysis and social network analysis to examine these patterns in Tibet, based on digital footprint data. Results revealed that tourist flows in Tibet exhibit a distinct hub-and-spoke pattern, characterized by high-frequency corridors connecting major destinations. Seasonal fluctuations are notable, with visitor volumes peaking in the third quarter and declining sharply during winter, especially in remote areas. Social network analysis identified prominent core nodes, Potala Palace, Namtso Lake, and Barkhor Street, serving as central hubs with strong radiative influence. In contrast, edge nodes attract more specialized tourist segments. This core-periphery structure underscores the spatial imbalance in tourism resource distribution, offering critical insights for targeted regional planning and balanced tourism development. These insights have practical applications in tourism planning in Tibet, thereby providing indispensable support for the sustainable development of tourism in plateau regions.

J	Maxwell, AL				Maxwell, AL			Holocene monsoon changes inferred from lake sediment pollen and carbonate records, northeastern Cambodia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Major Holocene monsoon changes in continental Southeast Asia are reconstructed from analysis of C-14-dated changes in pollen and organic/inorganic carbon in sediment cores taken from permanent, closed-basin, volcanic lakes in Ratanakiri Province, northeastern Cambodia. Analysis focuses on the nature and timing of monsoon changes, inferred from changes in vegetation and lake conditions. These data provide the first well-dated palynological record, covering most of the Holocene and continuous up to the present, from a terrestrial site in mainland Southeast Asia. The record from a 15-m core retrieved from Kara Lake, representing the last 9300 years, shows that the late Glacial conditions ended about 8500 C-14 yr B.P., more than 1000 years later than sites in southwest China. Summer monsoon intensity increased over the period ca. 8400-5300 C-14 yr B.P., similar to most other sites in the Asian monsoon region. A subsequent expansion of secondary forests at the expense of dense semievergreen forests suggest a drier climate leading to more frequent fire disturbance. After ca. 3500 C-14 yr B.P. disturbance frequency may have increased further with increasing seasonality. From ca. 2500 C-14 yr B.P. to the present, dense forest has recovered in a mosaic with annually burned dry forest, but climate may not be the main control on local vegetation dynamics in the late Holocene.

J	Walker, D				Walker, D.			The frequency of lamination in the sediments of Lake Barrine, tropical north-east Australia, during the last five millennia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												At Lake Barrine (17 degrees 15'S, 145 degrees 38'E, 721 m a.s.l.) under water >55 m deep, the uppermost sediment is composed of alternating detritus-poor and detritus-rich laminae. The former are interpreted as the continuous sedimentation (mostly plankton) from the undisturbed water body, the latter as redeposition during turbulent periods, induced by unusually cold winters, of material previously accumulated under shallower water. A continuous, 4.5 m long, stratigraphic record from beneath the deepest water (67 m) consists of about 3000 individual laminations, punctuated by characteristic, relatively thick, 'marker bands'. Each lamina was measured and allocated to one of the two categories. A chronology based on 28 radiocarbon dates, monotonically decreasing in age with decreasing depth, established a span from 5 ka cal BP to 1987 AD, the collection year. The plot of the durations of detritus-poor laminations, hence the return times of laminating events, is divisible into 20 Sections. Laminating events are not annual but 80% of return times lie between 1 and 6 years. Apart from the lowermost three Sections (5 ka-3.9 ka) having a greater number of long return times than the rest, there is no systematic change in the modes or ranges of the relative frequencies of return times between Sections. Prediction of the characteristics of a Section from those of its predecessor is impossible, nor, within a Section, is any return time a good predictor of the subsequent one. Extreme events are indicated most obviously by the marker bands which represent periods of unusual turbulence in the water body, perhaps by the occurrence of several consecutive very cold winters or the passage of a cyclonic wind directly over the lake. Long placid periods, evidenced by thick detritus-poor laminae spanning >10 years, are not systematically distributed through time except for their absence from 3.0 ka to 2.3 ka and their concentration from 5.0 ka to 4.4 ka. Uncertainties imposed by the methods used are discussed as are those relating to their palaeoclimatic application. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Surficial sediments show a reasonably uniform contaminant distribution throughout the sedimentation basins (SBs) with no strong plumes to sources. Sediment samples outside the SBs displayed very low contaminant concentrations, indicating that over the long term sediment-associated contaminants wind up in the SBs. Sediment trap studies showed that a considerable amount of sediment resuspension occurs in the lake, especially when it is unstratified during the winter. This observation helps to explain the fairly uniform concentrations found in the SBs. Sediment core studies showed peak discharges of the contaminants occurred in the late 1950s (DDT) and the mid 1960s (PCbs, mirex, and chlorobenzene) in good agreement with production and usage history. Changes in PCB and DDT composition in the cores are discussed.

Species Richness, Molecular Taxonomy and Biogeography of the Radicine Pond Snails (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) in the Old World	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The radicine pond snails represent a species-rich and widely distributed group, many species of which are key vectors of human and animal trematodoses. Here we clarify the taxonomy, distribution and evolutionary biogeography of the radicine lymnaeids in the Old World based on the most comprehensive multi-locus molecular dataset sampled to date. We show that the subfamily Amphipepleinae is monophyletic and contains at least ten genus-level clades: Radix Montfort, 1810, Ampullaceana Servain, 1881, Peregriana Servain, 1881, Tibetoradix Bolotov, Vinarski & Aksenova gen. nov., Kamtschaticana Kruglov & Starobogatov, 1984, Orientogalba Kruglov & Starobogatov, 1985, Cerasina Kobelt, 1881, Myxas G. B. Sowerby I, 1822, Bullastra Bergh, 1901, and Austropeplea Cotton, 1942. With respect to our phylogeny, species-delimitation model and morphological data, the Old World fauna includes 35 biological species of radicines. Tibet and Eastern Europe harbor the richest faunas, while East Asia and Africa appear to be the most species-poor areas. The radicine clade could have originated near the Cretaceous - Paleocene boundary. The Miocene great lakes in Eurasia seems to be the most important evolutionary hotspots shaping spatial patterns of recent species richness. Finally, we present the first DNA barcode reference library for the reliable molecular identification of species within this group.

We propose that local environmental conditions, dispersal limitation, and climate affect cladocerans and copepods differently owing to their variances in terms of life strategies. We calculated beta diversity using four dissimilarity metrics, and also the relative importance of spatial, environmental, and climatic variables by partitioning variance and forward selection procedure coupled with a partial redundancy analysis. Beta diversity patterns were characterized by a high turnover in the subbasins and a small contribution of nestedness. Forward selection evidenced the influence of total nitrogen and total suspended matter for both copepods and cladocerans, suggesting a strong role of eutrophication in controlling their turnover, but spatial distance, precipitation, and mean temperature of winter were related only to copepods. The last one suggests a likely role of geographic isolation driving speciation and endemism in Copepoda and reinforces the strong effect of climatic variation resulting in the high endemism patterns one finds in the Neotropical region.

Zooplankton Community Responses to Oxygen Stress	WATER												Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.

Interannual changes in the summer zooplankton in the lakes of the Khopyor River flood plain	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												By zooplankton indices, the lakes of the Khopyor River flood plain in the reserve area can be classified as eutrophic-hypertrophic reservoirs. In the years of intensive overflow of the Khopyor River, the trophic level of the flood plain lakes has been revealed to increase; the variety, numbers, biomass, and relative abundance of rotifers in the zooplankton increase. It is most evident in the coastal zone, where the total number and biomass of the zooplankton decreases. In the central parts of the lakes, the number and biomass of zooplankton increase, as does the proportion of crustaceans and the variety of rotifers. In the zooplankton of the central parts of the reservoirs with the longest term of coastal flooding after high water, the fraction of rotifers in the total number and the biomass of zooplankton communities increases. Simultaneously, the annually flooded lakes are characterized by maximum specific richness.

Two of the lakes (Asylum and Woods Lakes) are located in urban Kalamazoo, Michigan, and the third (Brewster Lake) is located in rural Hastings, Michigan. In summer, the water columns of all three lakes are distinctly redox stratified, with anoxic hypolimnia and significant accumulation of reduced solutes (e. g., Mn(II), Fe(II), ammonia) in the lake bottom waters. Extremely elevated conductivity, chloride, sodium, and potassium levels are observed in the urban Asylum and Woods Lakes compared to the rural Brewster Lake, presumably due to runoff of road salt deicers applied in the surrounding watershed. These significant changes in water quality are of concern because they may detrimentally impact lake mixing, biodiversity, and ecosystem function in the urban lakes.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2012	223	3					1415	1427		10.1007/s11270-011-0954-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0954-y													WOS:000303385500039

The field abundance of this copepod has been monitored for 10 years, but nothing is known about the cues that induce and terminate encystment. In the laboratory, different photoperiods and temperatures were tested for their effects on encystment and excystment. The photoperiod and temperature cues tested neither induced nor inhibited encystment in H. nunni. Encystment occurred in all treatments, regardless of temperature or photoperiod, suggesting that internal genetic cues, tied to a specific ontogenetic stage, must be the central causal factor. Copepods in the hot treatments encysted and excysted more rapidly than in the cold. Many copepods in the cold treatment encysted (though later than copepods in the hotter treatments), and most were still within the cyst at the end of the 23-week experiment. There were significantly more males within the full cysts than females. A concurrent field study confirmed the known seasonal patterns in the number of encystments relative to the number of free-living forms; i.e., encystment took place in the summer.																			0006-3185					FEB	1992	182	1					109	116		10.2307/1542185	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1542185								29304710					WOS:A1992KC97300012

Community Biological Ammonium Demand: A Conceptual Model for Cyanobacteria Blooms in Eutrophic Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (Cyano-HABs) ate enhanced by anthropogenic pressures, including excessive nutrient (nitrogen, N, and.hosphoms, P) inputs and a warming climate. Severe eutrophication in aquatic systems is often manifested as non-N-2-fixing CyanoHABs (e.g., Microcystis spp.), but the biogeochemical relationship between N inputs/dynamics and CyanoHABs needs definition. Community biological ammonium (NH4+) demand (CBAD) relates N dynamics to total microbial productivity and NH4+ deprivation in aquatic systems. A mechanistic conceptual model was constructed by combining nutrient cycling and CBAD observations from a spectrum of lakes to assess N cycling interactions with CyanoHABs. Model predictions were supported with CBAD data from a Microcystis bloom in Maumee Bay, Lake Erie, during summer 2015. Nitrogen compounds are transformed to reduced, more bioavailable forms (e.g., NH4+ and urea) favored by CyanoHABs. During blooms, algal biomass increases faster than internal NH4+ regeneration rates, causing high CBAD values. High turnover rates from cell death and remineralization of labile organic matter consume oxygen and enhance denitrification. These processes drive eutrophic systems to NH4+ limitation or colimitation under warm, shallow conditions and support the need for dual nutrient (N and P) control.

In order to better understand lakes biological status, we sampled five lakes during a six year survey one time each summer Results show that in these five lakes, diversity and abundance of phytoplankton are not high. However physico-chemical analysis reveal a good quality of water extremely unusual in modem countries. So, it is important to preserve these ecosystems to maintain this natural patrimony.																			1661-464X					MAY	2006	59	1					9	20																WOS:000246168400002

Measurements were taken from twelve randomly-selected plants at each of four depth intervals along two transects on five dates during each year from 1990 to 1992. Density, length, foliation, and biomass attributes of stems and branches were each influenced somewhat differently by depth and location. Plants growing in deep water were long and thin, while plants growing in shallow water were shorter and more robust, with greater relative amounts of foliation. Plants at most locations increased in length, but percent of total plant length (and biomass) comprised of foliated stem decreased over time.																			0270-5060					MAR	1995	10	1					19	31		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663413													WOS:A1995QM53800003

The dynamics of relative flow and Cl contributions from the major sources forming the Oswego River, and the dynamics of flow releases from 1 source, Cl polluted Onondaga Lake, were determined from these measurements, available Cl concentrations and flow data for the system, through application of a simple mass balance on Cl. The Cl concentration and load in the Oswego River was highly variable with time, and largely due to the dynamics of flow release from Onondaga Lake. The Cl distribution in the Oswego River, with its unique dynamics and chemically conservative nature, made it a valuable hydraulic tracer for the system.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1984	23	1					69	80		10.1007/BF00185132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00185132													WOS:A1984ST46200007

The onus for solution usually falls on the most severely affected jurisdiction, others do nothing until impacted. Resolution of these problems requires cooperation across political boundaries which means that local governments must be persuaded first that there is a problem, and second that action is required to solve it. This paper presents a method to supply low cost, credible information that can be used to achieve consensus on problem solution. A case study of a lake water quality management problem is described. Formative evaluation techniques was adapted to provide a minimum of evidence which was then used to persuade less impacted local jurisdictions to cooperate in the problem solution.																			0043-1370					DEC	1990	26	6					893	899																WOS:A1990FF19800002

Caddis-flies (Insecta: Trichoptera) from the Insect Limestone (Bembridge Marls, Late Eocene) of the Isle of Wight, UK	EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH												The trichopteran assemblage of the Late Eocene Bembridge Marls is revised. six species in five genera and four families are identified, with four species and two genera described as new: (Beraeidae: Beraeodes vectensis Cockerell, 1921 and B. anglicus Cockerell, 1921; Phryganeidae: Bembridgea insularia gen. sp. nov.; Polycentropodidae: ?

The assemblage is unique in being absolutely dominated by the generally uncommon family Beraeidae, and particularly by the single species Beraeodes vectensis. Except for a representative of ubiquitous Phryganaeidae, all the caddis-flies recorded apparently had oxy-and psychrophilous larvae confined to springs and cold streams (or else mosses near water), thus indicating the absence of fresh lakes or slow running waters near the depositional water body.

Shorebirds were collected from a representative playa lake where species-specific dietary and foraging site comparisons were determined. Migrant shorebirds seemed attracted to specific foraging sites where food was abundant. The occurrence of these sites within the overall playa lake regime was probably limited, but shorebirds appeared to use food resources efficiently. Based on diets, coefficients of dietary overlap, behavior and foraging sites selected by each species, shorebirds did not appear to be competing. An hypothesis is presented that shorebirds experience some population regulation during the migratory portion of their annual cycle.																			0273-8570	1557-9263					1984	55	2					220	229																WOS:A1984TK50500009

Modeling the growth response of Cladophora in a Laurentian Great Lake to the exotic invader Dreissena and to lake warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A Cladophora growth model ( CGM) is calibrated and validated here to simulate attached and sloughed Cladophora biomass in daily time-steps in an urbanized location of Lake Ontario, using two years of collected input data and independent measurements of Cladophora biomass. The CGM is used to hindcast Cladophora growth using multiplicative factors of seasonal minimal tissue phosphorus concentrations ( Q(P)) and seasonal mean nearshore light attenuation ( Kd(PAR)) of the early 1970s and 1980s relative to modern data. The possible effects of climate on growth are also forecast using additive temperature increases. Cladophora QP in Lake Ontario has declined in parallel with decreasing pelagic P concentrations, resulting in reduced Cladophora biomass at all depths in the euphotic zone. KdPAR has also declined, most strongly since the mid-1990s, following Dreissena mussel invasion, driving an increase in biomass between 3.5- and 10-m depth. Combining these effects, the CGM predicts that biomass along shorelines today is lower in Lake Ontario than in the 1980s. However, any increases in QP in this post-dreissenid-mussel period will result in greater Cladophora proliferation than in previous decades due to increased nearshore water clarity. Cladophora QP, while still currently lower than in the early 1980s, may be rising due to P supply to the littoral zone by the invasive mussels. The surface water temperature of Lake Ontario indicates warming of 0.96 degrees C decade(-1) from 1980 to 2006. With increasing surface water temperatures, the CGM predicts an earlier spring growth but only a marginal increase in peak Cladophora biomass.

Inter-annual variability and forecast of the spring ice phenomena on Lake Baikal and reservoirs of the Angara cascade	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The study of interannual variability of ice phenomena on large inland waters, as well as the ice forecasts for them are of great practical importance for navigation because any ice on water interferes with navigation. This article presents a description of the developed approach to mapping the stages of melting and destruction of ice cover on Lake Baikal, and the Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk reservoirs using data from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and shows examples of the ice condition maps in the spring. The AVHRR data, obtained for the period 1998-2015, made possible to analyze processes of the ice disappearance on aquatories of the South, Central and North parts of Lake Baikal, and the Bratsk and Ust'-Ilimsk reservoirs including determination of dates of the total ice disappearance (the first ice-free dates) on the reservoirs under investigation: the average, earliest and latest dates, and a range. It has been found that the interannual changes of these dates are the opposite to the inter-annual fluctuations of values of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index, that allows using the AO index as a predictor in regional predictive dependencies. Using results of analysis of the AO index values, averaged over different time intervals, and the data series of the first dates of the ice-free situations we constructed regional equations allowing to foresee a character of the ice situation with the average earliness from 21 to 33 days. Tests of effectiveness of the proposed predictive dependencies demonstrated a good quality of forecasts of the dates when Southern, Central and Northern parts of Lake Baikal, as well the Bratsk and Ust-Ilimsk reservoirs become totally free of ice.

The bottom topography and sediments of Lake Murakanskoye were examined using sonar and ground penetration radar (GPR) survey, whereas in the other locations only the water depth was measured. Then, the digital models of the lake bottom topography were created. As an additional indicator of the relative sea-level (RSL) position, we used data on the altitude of the coastal terraces. Evidences of two transgressions in the White Sea (late glacial and Middle Holocene) are revealed. The transgressions were interrupted by two regressions (Early and Late Holocene). Our studies do not allow us to make a clear conclusion about the time and maximum level of the late glacial transgression. However, we may suggest that its level was above 11 m a.s.l. The regression of the Early Holocene started before 10.6-10.2 ka cal BP when the water level in the study area dropped below the altitude of 11m. At 9.4-9.1 ka cal BP the RSL was at an altitude of ca 7m. The Middle Holocene transgression (Tapes) started after 8.4 ka cal BP. The maximum level was reached before 7.4 ka cal BP and did not exceed an altitude of 9.5 m. The RSL stabilized at an altitude about 8.5-8 m during 7.4-6.0 ka cal BP. During 6.0-3.9 ka cal BP RSL very slowly decreased or fluctuated by the level of 8-7 m. RSL began to fall from the 7 m altitude about 4.0-3.9 ka cal BP and by 2.7-2.3 ka cal BP the sea-level reached 4.5 m. After that RSL dropped to its modern position. During the last 4.0 ka cal BP the rate of RSL fall was approximately 0.17-0.18 cm/year.					; Shilova, Olga/AAM-6447-2021; Shilova, Olga/L-9170-2015; Yakovleva, Alena/JRW-4692-2023; Gurinov, Artem/L-9824-2015; Subetto, Dmitry/A-4467-2014; Lugovoy, Nikolay/L-9419-2015; Repkina, Tatiana/L-9353-2015	Kublitskiy, Yuriy/0000-0001-7955-8944; Shilova, Olga/0000-0002-2383-2438; Subetto, Dmitry/0000-0002-3585-8598; Yakovleva, Alena/0000-0002-8231-3515; Repkina, Tatiana/0000-0003-4345-8807; Lugovoy, Nikolay/0000-0001-8021-0953; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 20	2023	644						79	95		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.04.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.04.016		OCT 2023											WOS:001012264900001

Adamawa lakes present slightly lower concentration of volcanic instable minerals and concentration of greater eolian sands; metahalloysites are particularly abundant in the clayey fraction. Western Cameroon lakes comprise strong thermic stratification that have enabled regular flood deposits (laminites fabrica); anoxic environment increases siderite and vivianite growings. Adamawa lakes appear areas of turn-over process during the dry season atmospheric cooling, this mecanism produced frequent reworkings of the bottom deposits. Diatoms floras are related to the less anoxic and the most nutritive waters. Unsupported Pb-210 and Cs-137 dosings allow sedimentation rate evaluation from 8.1 to 64.5 mg/cm-2/an1 and, in some cases, flood periodicity measurements of 13 to 18 years. Several accelerations of the sedimentation rate are observed during the last decades, they are related to cultural developments or to overgrazing. Generally, specific erosion of the sides are triggered most by the irregularity of rain falls and the soils denudation than by the slope.																			0037-9409						1994	165	4					363	380																WOS:A1994PE25100007

This microbial community could be altered by habitat pollution and other human activities that threaten the host organisms. Here, we satellite-tracked a flock of swan geese (Anser cygnoides) migrating from their breeding area (Khukh Lake, Mongolia), with low levels of human activity, to their wintering area (Poyang Lake, China) which has been heavily impacted by human activities. Twenty fecal samples were collected from each site. High-throughput sequencing of 165 and ITS was employed to explore bacterial and fungal composition and diversity of their gut microbiome. Although general composition, alpha-diversity, functional prediction, and the central taxa in the phylogenetic networks showed some similarities between the two habitats, significant divergences were detected in terms of beta-diversity, species abundances, and interaction network topologies. In addition, disease-related and xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, and pathogenic bacteria were significantly increased in bacterial communities from samples at Poyang Lake. Our results reveal that the gut microbiome of swan geese, while somewhat altered after long-distance migration, still maintained a core group of species. We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome.					杨, 预展/J-3027-2012; Deng, Ye/X-4358-2019; Liu, Yangying/NEU-0027-2025; Xu, Meiying/AAM-1646-2020	Wang, Zhujun/0000-0003-0776-9210; Liu, Yangying/0000-0001-9662-1941; ?, ?/0000-0002-7584-0632; 													2045-2322					SEP 6	2018	8								13314	10.1038/s41598-018-31731-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-31731-9								30190564					WOS:000443800900011

The number of paleoenvironmental records is still limited in this region. Sediments of this lake were studied in order to obtain multi-proxy information about the paleoenvironmental history of this site for the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' and the 'Little Ice Age' chronozones. In combination with results from other sites across southern Patagonia, our data enhance the understanding of spatial patterns of past hydrological changes and contribute to distinguishing between the signals of temperature and precipitation. As Laguna Las Vizcachas is situated at 1100 m a.s.l. in a cool 'mountain climate', the lake system is more sensitive to changes of temperature and winter ice cover than other sites from lower elevations in this region. Our interpretation of the multi-proxy dataset is based on signals of clastic sediment input, lake productivity, organic matter sources and preservation, dilution effects and early diagenetic overprint. The record reveals a period of enhanced fluvial runoff resulting from higher precipitation from the 12th until the end of the 14th century as inferred from high concentrations of Ti, Ca, and from magnetic susceptibility. This may coincide with higher wind intensities as suggested by higher proportions of epiphytic diatoms which point to an enhanced lateral transport from their littoral habitat towards the coring position at the center of the lake. in comparison with other records from southern Patagonia, the results from Laguna Las Vizcachas suggest opposite precipitation regimes between the western and eastern parts of Patagonia during that time which corresponds partly to the 'Medieval Climate Anomaly' chronozone. However, this proposal is compromised by the chronological uncertainties of the different records under consideration. The diatom record of Laguna Las Vizcachas indicates temperature changes: highest proportions of benthic diatoms point to coldest conditions from the mid-15th until the mid-17th century, followed by relatively warm conditions until the mid-18th century as suggested by a decrease of benthic taxa and a conspicuous rise of the planktonic/non-planktonic diatom ratio that can be used as an indicator for the length or presence/absence of winter ice cover.

J	Vázquez, SH				Vázquez, SH			Water birds from Agua Dulce lake and El Ermitano estuary, Jalisco, Mexico.	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Waterbird abunclance, and seasonal and spatial distribution, were studied in two natural water pools at Jalisco,Mexico, from December 1997 through November 1998. Maximum monthly abundance in Agua Dulce lake and El Ermitano estuary was 86 471 birds (29 686 in Agua Dulce and 56 785 in Ermitano), with a total cummulative abundance of 179 808 individuals (66 976 in Agua Dulce and H 2 832 in Ermitafio). A total of 87 waterbirds species were recorded, 79 in Agua Dulce and 73 in Ermitano. The higher species richness and abundance was observed during winter, when migratory species arrived. Most species prefered shallow waters, except seabirds which prefered protected areas such as dunes in Agua Dulce. Other groups, like ducks and related species, prefered low salinity areas, for example in the south-east area of Ermitafio. The higher abundance of the shorebirds was found when the water level on the estuary was low. Herons were seen often at areas with high salinity and influenced by tides (e.g. mouth of Ermitano).																			0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR-JUN	2005	53	1-2					229	238																WOS:000232593200025

For 26 months (April 2012-May 2014), we monitored zooplankton in a warm-temperate ice-free lake in Eastern China, with an emphasis on seasonal population dynamics of the cladoceran, Daphnia galeata. There was a seasonal succession in the zooplanktonic community (composed of Cladocera, Copepoda, and Rotifera). Genetic analysis (based on 14 microsatellite loci) of the 21 monthly samples in which D. galeata was present demonstrated that several clones could successfully overwinter and/or persist for many months. However, all clones, including these long-lived clones, were completely replaced by new ones after October 2013, probably due to cyanobacteria blooms in that summer. A high clonal richness coupled with high turnover rate was observed in the D. galeata population overall, suggesting frequent sexual reproduction. Daphnia galeata experimentally fed with a diet of Microcystis aeruginosa (the most abundant toxic cyanobacterial species in the lake) had a substantially reduced survivorship, consistent with the field observations. Our findings highlight the changes of zooplanktonic population dynamics in terms of both community and clonal structure in a warm-temperate ice-free lake, and call for further investigation on ecological responses of zooplankton to cyanobacterial blooms.

Mid-Holocene humidity changes in arid and semi-arid China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Spatial changes of effective moisture during the mid-Holocene have been reconstructed based on the compilation of recently published paleoclimate records, including ice core, lake level, pollen assemblage, and loess-paleosol records. Both geological data and the spatial pattern indicate that it was dry in deserts during the mid-Holocene, but the timing of the beginning and end of dry intervals differs from place to place. Deserts having higher aridity index values remain dry longer. Dry intervals during the mid-Holocene are more possibly asynchronous than synchronous in and and semi-arid China. In the Xinjiang region, except in sites located in deserts, the climate is generally wet during 7000-5000a BP. In the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, effective moisture in most sites began to decrease after 5000a BP. The climate became dry after 4000a BP except in the deserts in the Loess Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sigua, GC; Coleman, SW; Albano, J				Sigua, Gilbert C.; Coleman, Samuel W.; Albano, Joseph			Beef cattle pasture to wetland reconversion: Impact on soil organic carbon and phosphorus dynamics	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												There is a major need to understand the historical condition and chemical/biological functions of the ecosystems following a conversion of wetlands to agricultural functions. To better understand the dynamics of soil total organic carbon (TOC) and phosphorus (P) during beef cattle pastures to wetland reconversion, soil core samples were collected from the beef cattle pasture and from the natural wetland at Plant City, FL, during five summer seasons (2002-2007). The levels of TOC and soil P were significantly affected by changing land use and hydrology. Draining natural wetlands to grazed pastures resulted in very pronounced reduction of TOC from 180.1 to 5.4 g g(-1). Cumulative concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) in soils (1134 mg kg(-1)) under drained condition are two to three times lower than those in soils (2752 mg kg(-1)) under flooded condition over the periods of land use reconversion. There was a declining trend (r=0.82**; p <= 0.01) in total soil P from natural wetland (763 mg kg(-1)) to altered pastures (340 mg kg(-1)), largely as organic-bound P (natural wetland, 48%; grazed pastures, 44%: altered pastures, 29%). These results are important in establishing baseline information on soil properties in pasture and wetland prior to restoring and reconverting pasture back to wetland conditions. The results further suggest that changes in soil properties due to changing land use and hydrologic conditions (drying and re-wetting) could be long lasting.

The optosensor response to sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate was linear from 5 x 10(-6) M to 5 x 10(-4) M which is a suitable range for the detection of anionic surfactant concentrations in polluted natural waters. The sample analysis was rapid (90% of the total response is reached in less than 30 s), convenient (no-sample pretreatment) and did not require organic reagents which are harmful to the environment. This work demonstrates the analytical potential of surfactant-protein interactions as a biorecognition mechanism using suitable luminescence probes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Natural disasters and infectious disease in Europe: a literature review to identify cascading risk pathways	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Natural disasters are increasing in their frequency and complexity. Understanding how their cascading effects can lead to infectious disease outbreaks is important for developing cross-sectoral preparedness strategies. The review focussed on earthquakes and floods because of their importance in Europe and their potential to elucidate the pathways through which natural disasters can lead to infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: A systematic literature review complemented by a call for evidence was conducted to identify earthquake or flooding events in Europe associated with potential infectious disease events. Results: This review included 17 peer-reviewed papers that reported on suspected and confirmed infectious disease outbreaks following earthquakes (4 reports) or flooding (13 reports) in Europe. The majority of reports related to food- and water-borne disease. Eleven studies described the cascading effect of post-disaster outbreaks. The most reported driver of disease outbreaks was heavy rainfall, which led to cross-connections between water and other environmental systems, leading to the contamination of rivers, lakes, springs and water supplies. Exposure to contaminated surface water or floodwater following flooding, exposure to animal excreta and post-disaster living conditions were among other reported drivers of outbreaks. Conclusions: The cascade effects of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, include outbreaks of infectious disease. The projection that climate change-related extreme weather events will increase in Europe in the coming century highlights the importance of strengthening preparedness planning and measures to mitigate and control outbreaks in post-disaster settings.

Habitat distribution of fish in late summer: changes along a nutrient gradient in Danish lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				The horizontal distribution of fish in lakes varies with species, age, predation risk, vegetation coverage and water clarity. Although sporadic data are available for specific lakes, little is known about how habitat distribution generally changes along a gradient in nutrients and clarity. Here we analyse littoral and pelagic fish catch data for 34 Danish lakes (covering 94 lake years) with contrasting total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and mean depth levels (but mainly eutrophic and shallow). Electrofishing was conducted during day along the shore or along the edge of the reed belt if such existed. Gill nets were set overnight for 18 h in open water. We calculated a littoral proportion as: LITPRO = (100 x number caught by electrofishing in the near-shore area)/(number caught by electrofishing in the near-shore area and nets in the open water). At all summer TP concentrations LITPRO was high for several 'littoral' species such as gudgeon (Gobio gobio), rudd (Scardinius erythrophtalmus) and pike (Esox lucius) and low for more typical pelagic species like pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). However, for many of these species including the dominant roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) LITPRO increased with TP or lake water chlorophyll a (CHLA) for fish > 10 cm, suggesting a more littoral distribution with increasing turbidity. Exceptions are pikeperch and bream (Abramis brama). For bream, LITPRO increased significantly with mean lake depth only. For fish <= 10 cm LITPRO showed only a weak relationship to TP, CHLA or depth. In accordance with the TP-dependent distribution, major changes occurred in the fish community structure during the monitoring period following nutrient loading reduction. A comparison of LITPRO from the first part of the monitoring period (1989-1993) with a subsequent period (1997-2003) for four abundant species showed a significant decline in LITPRO over time for large- and small-sized roach and perch and large rudd. This suggests a fast response in fish distribution to improved water quality. It further demonstrates that fish monitoring in lakes should cover both littoral and pelagic habitats to describe the recovery process.

Beside anthropogenic factors controlling jellyfish populations climate change may play an important role. The aim of this study was to assess whether climate-related factors in absence of other anthropogenically induced stressor influence medusae size. We investigated seasonal and interannual changes in the size of Aurelia in a "jelly lake" in the National Park of Mljet Island (Croatia) where minimal human impact on the environment makes the Veliko Jezero a natural mesocosm for understanding the impact of climate change on the Aurelia population. The observed changes suggest Aurelia medusa population response to changing environment, in particular to enhanced temperature, by reduced body sizes. Comparison of Aurelia population dynamics from different regions in the Mediterranean Sea revealed the unique feature of the Veliko Jezero population. Despite the similarity of the environmental windows of medusae occurrences in the Veliko Jezero and regions in the Mediterranean Sea, medusae in the Veliko Jezero are present all year round. It seems that the lake bathymetry enables medusae to vertically migrate to deeper and cooler water layer, avoiding the limiting temperatures developed in the upper layer during the summer. These conditions may prolong the Aurelia medusae life span and together with continuous strobilation support the stability of the Aurelia medusae population all year round.					; Kogovsek, Tjasa/HGD-3803-2022; Onofri, Ivona/AAG-6797-2019; Delphine, BONNET/AGO-3181-2022; Malej, Alenka/HPC-1679-2023; Hure, Marijana/HKE-6335-2023	Kogovsek, Tjasa/0000-0002-0887-4701; Malej, Alenka/0000-0001-6650-4795; 													0001-5113	1846-0453				DEC	2012	53	2					233	242																WOS:000313420800005

George; Weiss, Dominik			The influence of climate, hydrology and permafrost on Holocene peat accumulation at 3500 m on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Peatland of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau lies at the convergence of the East Asian and Indian monsoon systems in eastern Asia. To understand the evolution of this peatland and its potential to provide new insights into the Holocene evolution of the East Asian monsoon a 6 m peat core was collected from the undisturbed central part of a peat deposit near Hongyuan. The age-depth profile was determined using 16 C-14-AMS age dates, the peat analysed for a range of environmental variables including carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen concentration, bulk density, delta C-13 and the associated spring water analysed for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. The age-depth profile of the recovered peat sequence covers the period from 9.6 to 0.3 kyr BP and is linear indicating that the conditions governing productivity and decay varied little over the Holocene. Using changes in carbon density, organic carbon content and its delta C-13, cold dry periods of permafrost characterised by low density and impeded surface drainage were identified. The low delta O-18 and delta D values of the spring water emanating around the peat deposit, down to -13.8 and -102% (VSMOW), respectively, with an inverse relationship between electrical conductivity and isotopic composition indicate precipitation under colder and drier conditions relative to the present day. In view of the current annual mean air temperature of 1 degrees C this suggests conditions in the past have been conducive to permafrost. Inferred periods of permafrost correspond to independently recognised cold periods in other Holocene records from across China at 8.6, 8.2-7.8, 5.6-4.2, 3.1 and 1.8-1.5 kyr BP. The transition to a cold dry climate appears to be more rapid than the subsequent recovery and cold dry periods at Hongyuan are of longer duration than equivalent cold dry periods over central and eastern China. Light-dark banding peat on a scale of 15-30 years from 9.6 to 5.5 kyr BP may indicate a strong influence of decadal oscillations possibly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and a potential link between near simultaneous climatic changes in the northwest Pacific, ENSO, movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the East Asian Monsoon.

High-resolution analyses of lake sediments retrieved from Qionghai Lake, Sichuan Province, were conducted using a combination of variables including total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentration, low frequency magnetic susceptibility (chi(LF)), particle size, carbonate content, and delta C-13 value of organic matter (delta C-13(org)), to provide a new perspective on the detailed paleoclimate history of south-west China spanning the past 30 cal ka BP. Our findings suggest that organic matter in the Qionghai Lake was mainly derived from microorganisms, aquatic macrophytes, and terrestrial C-3 plants. From 29.1 to 23.2 cal ka BP, low carbonate contents, high median grain size (Md values), and chi(LF) values indicated a warm and wet climate. During the period 23.2 to 15.4 cal ka BP, low chi(LF), Md values, and high carbonate contents suggested a decrease in temperature and humidity. The cold and dry Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Heinrich 1 event (H1) were captured between 21.6 and 19.4 cal ka BP and 17.6 and 15.8 cal ka BP, respectively. During the interval 15.4 to 9.7 cal ka BP, low level of chi(LF) values and Md values, together with relatively high carbonates, demonstrated that a dry climate prevailed in this period. Since 9.7 cal ka BP, the climate was warm and humid in the early to mid-Holocene and shifted towards cold and dry condition in the late Holocene. A cold and dry period at 8.5 to 8.1 cal ka BP and warm and wet interval at 6.6 to 4.6 cal ka BP were identified, corresponding to the 8.2-ka cold event and Holocene climatic optimum (HCO), respectively. These climate changes may reflect variations of the intensity of the south-west summer monsoon, primarily in response to the Northern Hemisphere solar insolation on a millennial scale induced by orbital forcing. The position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) may add a complementary effect on the evolution of the monsoon strength in the Holocene.

Italy) and effects on zebra mussel spawning	CHEMOSPHERE												Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is commonly used as contaminant bioindicator in Europe and North America. We used the zebra mussel to follow DDT pollution trends from 1996 to 1997 in Pallanza bay, Lake Maggiore, near the inlet of the River Toce, after a DDT-manufacturing plant discharging residues into a tributary of the River Toce had closed down. DDT contamination fell off sharply outside the bay, but tissue concentrations of the parent compound and residues remained high in molluscs sampled within the bay a year later. Molluscs collected in Pallanza bay in June 1997 released gametes earlier than those sampled at a nearby reference station. Histological studies showed that a significant percentage of these specimens showed marked oocyte degeneration suggesting that DDTs have endocrine-disrupting effects in this species.

The objectives of this study were to: (1) present an innovative statistical approach that takes into account such nonstationarity; and (2) use this approach to analyze long-term nutrient data from four Chinese lakes, including Lake Dongting, Poyang, Chao and Tai, to investigate the temporal trends of TN and TP in the past decades. The results revealed that both TN and TP in Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang exhibited an upward trend at annual, seasonal, and monthly timescales. Nutrient concentration in Lake Dongting displayed a step change around 2003, a downward trend in April before 2003 but an upward trend in April after 2003 because of point and non-point source pollution, overexploitation, and dam construction. TN concentration for Lake Chao and Lake Tai experienced step changes around 1999 and 2002, respectively. For Lake Chao, spanning the years before the step change, significant (significance level of alpha = 0.05) upward trends in TN were detected at the annual scale as well as in summer and May, but spanning the years after the step change, significant downward trends were detected. For Lake Tai, significant upward trends before the step change and downward trends after the step change were detected at the annual scale and in October.

Astrobiology of life on Earth	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Astrobiology is mistakenly regarded by some as a field confined to studies of life beyond Earth. Here, we consider life on Earth through an astrobiological lens. Whereas classical studies of microbiology historically focused on various anthropocentric sub-fields (such as fermented foods or commensals and pathogens of crop plants, livestock and humans), addressing key biological questions via astrobiological approaches can further our understanding of all life on Earth. We highlight potential implications of this approach through the articles in this Environmental Microbiology special issue 'Ecophysiology of Extremophiles'. They report on the microbiology of places/processes including low-temperature environments and chemically diverse saline- and hypersaline habitats; aspects of sulphur metabolism in hypersaline lakes, dysoxic marine waters, and thermal acidic springs; biology of extremophile viruses; the survival of terrestrial extremophiles on the surface of Mars; biological soils crusts and rock-associated microbes of deserts; subsurface and deep biosphere, including a salticle formed within Triassic halite; and interactions of microbes with igneous and sedimentary rocks. These studies, some of which we highlight here, contribute to our understanding of the spatiotemporal reach of Earth'sfunctional biosphere, and the tenacity of terrestrial life. Their findings will help set the stage for future work focused on the constraints for life, and how organisms adapt and evolve to circumvent these constraints.

The sigma degrees evolution of three ice cover scenarios is observed and simulated using a bubbled ice sigma degrees model. The range resolution of UW-SCAT provides separation of interaction at the snow-ice interface (P1), and within the ice volume and ice-water interface (P2). Ice cores extracted at the end of the observation period indicate a P2 sigma degrees increase of approximately 10-12 decibels (dB) (HH & VV) at X-and Ku-band coincident to tubular bubble development. Similarly, complexity of the ice surface (gray ice) results in increased P1 sigma degrees (similar to 7dB). P1 observations indicate that Ku-band is sensitive to snowpack overlying lake ice, with sigma degrees exhibiting a 5 (6) dB drop for VV (HH) when 0.235 m snow is removed. X-band is insensitive to changes in overlying snowpack. A bubbled ice sigma degrees model is presented using dense medium-radiative transfer theory under the quasi-crystalline approximation (DMRT-QCA), which treats bubbles as spherical inclusions within an ice volume. Model runs demonstrate the capability of DMRT to produce observed sigma degrees magnitude using snow and ice observations as input. This study improves the understanding of microwave interaction with bubbled ice near the surface or within the volume. Results from this study indicate that further model development involves bubble shape modification within the ice from spherical to tubular.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011; Brogioni, Marco/B-7522-2015; Macelloni, Giovanni/B-7518-2015; Brogioni, Marco/Q-6583-2019	King, Joshua/0000-0002-0353-8987; Brogioni, Marco/0000-0001-6232-6020; MACELLONI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-9738-7939; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													1939-1404	2151-1535				JUL	2015	8	7			SI		3629	3642		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2420411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2420411													WOS:000359538700035

Persistence of 2,4-D and its Effects on Benthic Macroinvertebrates Following Spring Treatment of Eurasian Watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum L. in Two Lakes in Southeastern Wisconsin, USA	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The purpose of this study was to determine the persistence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) applied to two lakes (one mesotrophic and one eutrophic) for the control of Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM), and to determine the impacts of 2,4-D on benthic macroinvertebrates in one of the lakes. One lake was treated with a liquid formulation, and the other with a slow release granular formulation of 2,4-D. Concentrations of 2,4-D in the water column were highest 1 and 2 days post-treatment and declined to below detection limits by 7 and 10 days post-treatment. We observed negative correlations between days post-treatment and taxa richness, and between days post-treatment and abundance of three of 12 taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates. Lake managers need to balance control of EWM with possible impacts of 2,4-D to nontarget organisms.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				APR	2014	92	4					404	409		10.1007/s00128-014-1206-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1206-9								24458246					WOS:000332797900006

Here we investigate hemispheric, latitudinal, and regional mean time series and time-slice anomaly maps of pollen-based reconstructions of mean annual temperature, mean July temperature, and annual precipitation from 1908 records in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Temperature trends show strong latitudinal patterns and differ between (sub-)continents. While the circum-Atlantic regions in Europe and eastern North America show a pronounced Middle Holocene temperature maximum, western North America shows only weak changes, and Asia mostly shows a continuous Holocene temperature increase. Likewise, precipitation trends show certain regional peculiarities such as the pronounced Middle Holocene precipitation maximum between 40 and 50(?) N in Asia and Holocene increasing trends in Europe and western North America, which can all be linked with Holocene changes in the regional circulation pattern responding to temperature change. Given a background of strong regional heterogeneity, we conclude that the calculation of global or hemispheric means, which initiated the Holocene conundrum debate, should focus more on understanding the spatiotemporal patterns and their regional drivers.

We examined productivity and nesting habitat characteristics of goshawks in Minnesota from 1998-2001. Apparent nesting success varied annually from as low as 38% to as high as 83%. The Mayfield estimate of daily survival for nests was 0.992 +/- 0.002 (SE). The mean fledgling number across years was 1.85 +/- 0.14 for successful nests and 1.14 +/- 0.17 for all nesting attempts. Twenty-one percent of all nesting attempts failed, primarily due to predation or suspected predation (52%) and inclement weather (35%). Overall, productivity of goshawks in Minnesota was at the lower end of the range reported in other studies across western North America, which is not atypical for peripheral populations. During the 3-yr study, we recorded mortalities of nine (four males and five females; eight radio-marked and one unmarked) adult goshawks-causes of mortality were avian (33%) and mammalian (22%) predation, human persecution (22%), and unknown causes (22%). Fifty-six percent of mortalities occurred during the breeding season, and 44% occurred during the winter. Based on radiotelemetry data, we estimated adult annual survival to be 74 7.8%, which is similar to survival estimated using mark-recapture analysis in three western North America studies.

An investigation into the occurrence of geosmin responsible for earthy-musty taints in UK farmed rainbow trout, Onchorhynchus mykiss	AQUACULTURE												Earthy-musty taints have been reported in edible fish around the world. While this has no adverse health effects on either the consumer or the fish, it does have a profound effect on consumer acceptance and marketability. Earthy-musty taints have been reported in farmed rainbow trout in the UK but little was known about the source of the problem. In this study it was found that geosmin (GSM) was the main compound associated with the seasonal occurrence of earthy taints in UK farmed trout. GSM production occurred upstream in rivers supplying water to fish farms and was at its highest concentration (similar to 25 ng l(-1)) during the warmer summer months. Fish tainted with GSM above the sensory threshold (0.9 mu g kg(-1)) were typically found to have between 1.0 and 3.0 mu g GSM kg(-1) fish, with a maximum observed level of 7.2 mu g kg(-1). Levels of 2-methylisoborneol were negligible in terms of its potential to cause taint. In a river-fed northern UK farm the seasonal build up of an epilithic Oscillatoria sp. was linked to tainting episodes. Rivers supplying tainted farms were classified as being eutrophic and had very low N/P ratios. Temperature and phosphates levels were positively correlated with levels of GSM in inflow waters.

The image recognition rate and accuracy are analyzed. Experimental results and comparison analysis indicate that extreme learning machine algorithm, SVM algorithm and K-means algorithm in general is not significant. The SVM algorithm for image continuity provides better results.

However, the sources of these aeolian sediments have not been resolved due to the lack of large reference GSD sample datasets from adjacent regions that contain various types of sediments; such datasets could be used for fingerprinting based on grain-size properties. This lack of knowledge hinders our understanding of the mechanism of aeolian dust releases in these regions and the effects of forcing of atmospheric circulations on the transportation and accumulation of sediments in this region. In this study, we employed a multi-scale grain-size analysis method, i.e., a combination of the single-sample unmixing (SSU) and the parametric end-member modelling (PEMM) techniques, to resolve the component structures of sediments that had accumulated along the desert-loess transition zone of the Tengger Desert. We have also analyzed the component structures of GSDs of various types of sediments, including mobile and fixed sand dunes, lake sediments, and loess sediments from surrounding regions. Our results demonstrate that the patterns observed in coarser fractions of sediments (i.e., sediments with a mode grain size of >100 mu m) from the transition zone match well with the patterns of component structures of several types of sediments from the interior of the Tengger Desert, and the patterns seen in the finer fractions (i.e., fine, medium, and coarse silts with a modal size of <63 mu m) were broadly consistent with those of loess sediments from the Qilian Mountains. The deflation/erosion of loess from the Qilian Mountains by wind was the most important mechanism underlying the production of these finer grain-size fractions. The East Asia winter monsoon (EAWM) played a key role in transportation of the aeolian dust from these source regions to the desert-loess transition zone of the desert.

Measurements of radioactive isotopes (Be-7, Cs-137, and Am-241) along with photographic analysis of the core were used to date the deep layers: the layer located at -30 cm dates from summer 2003, and that located at -70 cm from 1990 to 1991. The physiological and morphological conditions of those benthic colonies were compared with those of planktonic colonies using several techniques (environmental scanning electron microscopy [ESEM], TEM, DNA markers, cellular esterases, and toxins). The ESEM observations showed that, as these colonies age, peripheral cells disappear, with no cells remaining in the mucilage of the deepest colonies (70 cm), an indication of the survival thresholds of these organisms. In the benthic phase, the physiological conditions (enzyme activity, cell division, and intracellular toxins) and ultrastructure (particularly the gas vesicles) of the cells surviving in the heart of the colony are comparable to those of the planktonic form, with all the potential needed for growth. Maintaining cellular integrity requires a process that can provide sufficient energy and is expressed in the reduced, but still existing, enzymatic activity that we measured, which is equivalent to a quiescent state.

J	Girardin, MP; Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y				Girardin, MP; Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y			Radial growth analysis of Larix laricina from the Lake Duparquet area, Quebec, in relation to climate and larch sawfly outbreaks	ECOSCIENCE												A dendrochronological study was performed at sis sites dominated by eastern larch, Larix laricina in Ouebec's southwestern boreal forest. The objectives were to reconstruct periods of larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii) outbreak in the region and to determine which physical factors (precipitation, temperature, water level or drought) explained the greatest variation in radial growth. From the presence of light latewood rings followed by periods of growth suppression. we identified larch sawfly outbreaks for the years 1895-1912, 1937-1942, and 1955-1962. We suspect that additional outbreaks occurred in the early 1920s, late 1970s and early 1980s as well, but at the same time as spruce budworm outbreaks (Choristoneura fumiferana). Response function analysis demonstrated negative relationships between larch radial growth and May and August precipitation and May and September current year water level, and demonstrated positive relationships with May current year drought index and September previous year drought index. These results suggest that flooding in the early growing season and excessive water levels at the end of the growing season may negatively affect larch radial growth. Our results also indicate an increase in the year-to-year variation in radial growth in larch sites subjected to flooding. This may reflect the increase in the Lake Duparquet water level at spring break up.

J	Liao, WW; Chen, HA; Peng, MJ; Chang, TW				Liao, Wenwen; Chen, Hsinan; Peng, Meijeng; Chang, Tawei			Spatio-Temporal Variation of Trophic Status and Water Quality with Water Level Fluctuation in a Reservoir	WATER												Water level fluctuation (WLF) is one of the important factors that affect reservoir water quality, habitat, species, and ecosystems. In this study, an independent sample t-test was used to evaluate the trophic status and water quality of the spatial and temporal variations with WLF in Shihmen Reservoir, Taiwan. The results of this study show that the Shihmen Reservoir has the lowest mean water level and higher potential of showing eutrophic status in April and May. This may be attributed to a lower water level, water depth, and transparency in this period. However, although there is no statistically significant difference in mean algal abundance in spring compared with other seasons, seasonal mean algae abundance and the seasonal mean Carlson's trophic status index (CTSI) show as highly and positively correlated. It means that the increase in the CTSI value may not only be caused by effects on the sediment increase but also by algal proliferation. Mean water depth seems to be one of the important key indexes for reservoir management regarding trophic status since it reflects water quality and can be easy to obtain. This study suggests that reservoir administration can use the water level as a reference threshold for controlling CTSI strategies.

If fluoride concentration of drinking water has been neglected, excess fluoride can cause serious dental and medical problems on human health, which is well known at Golcuk-Isparta region. In the research area, Egirdir lake, Golcuk lake and surrounding springs have been utilized as drinking water sources. Golcuk lake water and surrounding groundwaters have high fluoride content (1.4-4.6 mg/l), which is above the WHO standards. Fluoride is predominantly supplied by dissolution of fluoride within the fluormicas of volcanics during the circulation of water. Fluoride concentrations of waters have shown variations for dry and rainy seasons depending on the degree of interaction between groundwater and volcanic rocks. It tends to decrease in rainy seasons and increase in dry seasons for all years. In this study, temporal variations and spatial distribution of fluoride concentration in public water system of Isparta were investigated to get benefit using GIS techniques from1990 to 2003 years. Extremely fluoride concentrations were measured in the public water system in 1990 at almost every district of the city. In 2003, fluoride content of the public water system decreased in some district of city due to drinking water has started obtaining from Egirdir lake in 1995. The fluoride contents of Isparta drinking water ought to be modified with suitable mixture of lake waters and groundwater point of view to health impact.					; Şener, Şehnaz/V-4712-2017; ŞENER, Erhan/AFV-9910-2022; Davraz, Aysen/ABI-5474-2020	Sener, Sehnaz/0000-0003-3191-2291; SENER, Erhan/0000-0001-6263-8366; 													0943-0105					NOV	2008	56	1					159	170		10.1007/s00254-007-1148-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1148-1													WOS:000260065300014

We used 24 m2 enclosures in which we manipulated the presence and absence of large redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus- > 150 mm SL), and small sunfish (L. macrochirus and L. microlophus < 50 mm SL) over a 16-mo period. Here we report on effects of fish predation on gastropod grazers that appear to cascade to periphyton and macrophytes. Both large redear sunfish and small sunfish maintained low snail biomass, but snails in fish-free controls increased significantly during the first 2-mo of the experiment. By late summer of the first year of the experiment, the difference in biomass between enclosures with and without fish had increased dramatically (> 10 x). Mid-way through the second summer of the experiment, we noted apparent differences in the abundance of periphyton between enclosures containing fish and those that did not. We also noted differences in the macrophyte distribution among enclosures. To document these responses, we estimated periphyton cover, biovolume and cell size frequencies as well as macrophyte distributions among enclosures at the end of the experiment. When fish were absent, periphyton percent cover was significantly reduced compared to when fish were present. Periphyton cell-size distributions in enclosures without fish were skewed toward small cells (only 12% were greater than 200 m3), which is consistent with intense snail grazing. The macrophyte Najas flexilis had more than 60 x higher biomass in the fish-free enclosures than in enclosures containing fish; Potamogeton diversifolius was found only in fish-free enclosures. These results suggest a chain of strong interactions (i.e. from fish to snails to periphyton to macrophytes) that may be important in lake littoral systems. This contrasts sharply with earlier predictions based on cascading trophic interactions that propose that fish predation on snails would enhance macrophyte biomass.																			0029-8549					APR	1992	89	4					476	481		10.1007/BF00317152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317152								28311876					WOS:A1992HL79100004
J	HOLMES, JA				HOLMES, JA			POTENTIAL FOR FISHERIES REHABILITATION IN THE HAMILTON-HARBOR COOTES-PARADISE ECOSYSTEM OF LAKE-ONTARIO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Present and historical information on the status of the Hamilton Harbour-Cootes Paradise ecosystem is synthesized to evaluate the potential for fisheries rehabilitation. Although the Hamilton ecosystem is seriously degraded, it is the largest and most important warmwater fish habitat in western Lake Ontario. Habitat losses, hypolimnetic anoxia, contaminated sediments nutrients, and sediment inputs are impediments to rehabilitation. Rehabilitation should focus on the warmwater fish assemblage as restoration of the historic coldwater fishery appears unlikely in the foreseeable future. Carroll''s Point has the best potential for rehabilitation, the south shore does not have any potential, and the remaining areas fall in between these extremes. Cootes Paradise, which has moderate potential, is adversely affected by sediment inputs from Spencer Creek, nutrients from the Dundas sewage treatment plant, and large carp population.																			0380-1330						1988	14	2					131	141		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71541-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71541-5													WOS:A1988N631100002

These deposits in lake Ulvadalsvatnet, western Norway, are discrete, sharp-bounded units of sand-sized sediment, running from gravelly and graded to silt-rich, and characterized by low total carbon and water contents. They are rich in terrestrial macroflora detritus, dark brown in colour, and interpreted as high-density turbidity current deposits attributed to subaerial debris flows that plunged into the lake. Thirty-three C-14 AMS dates were derived from three cores, and though the ages are somewhat inconsistent (macroflora invariably younger than bulk sediment samples), they indicate a marked increase in debris-flow processes after c. 2200 cal. yr BP, considered to reflect increased occurrence of heavy rainstorms.																			0959-6836					NOV	2003	13	6					907	920		10.1191/0959683603hl673rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl673rp													WOS:000185916300010

Effects of seasonal and interannual variability in water isotopes (δ2H, δ18O) on estimates of water balance in a chain of seven prairie lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X												Stable isotopes of hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) provide important quantitative measures of lake hydrology and water balance, particularly in lakes where monitoring of fluxes is incomplete. However, little is known of the relative effects of seasonal variation in water isotopes on estimates of lake hydrology, particularly over decadal scales. To address this gap, we measured water isotopes bi-weekly May-September during 2003-2016 in seven riverine lakes within the 52,000 km(2) Qu'Appelle River drainage basin of the Canadian Prairies. Analyses revealed that within-year variation in delta O-18 values routinely exceeded that among years, reflecting rapid changes in water source, particularly in lakes with water residence times <1 year. Isotopic variation was greatest during spring following snowmelt, except in large deep lakes which exhibited limited differences among seasons or years. In contrast, large hydrological events (e.g., 1-in-140-year flood in 2011) homogenized isotopic values, even among riverine lakes separated by over 150 km, and exerted particularly strong legacy effects on large lakes. Overall, study lakes exhibited a strongly positive moisture balance (evaporation < inflow), despite regional precipitation deficits of 30 cm yr(-1), with greater reliance on rainfall (vs. snow) and possibly evaporation in downstream lakes within more humid regions. We conclude that seasonal samples of water isotopes are required to characterize the hydrology of shallow lakes, or those with unknown reliance on snowmelt waters, as well as to better quantify lake susceptibility to climate variability.

Spatial bias in aquatic monitoring programs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Citizen science aquatic monitoring programs often rely on opportunistic, incidental contributions, which can lead to spatial bias, the uneven geographical distribution of sample sites. It is less known how this spatial bias compares to professional monitoring activities, or how geospatial biases (e.g. terrain slope, population density, road density) influence aquatic citizen science and professional lake monitoring programs. This paper compares sample sites in Ontario's volunteer Lake Partner Program, against those identified by a stratified random sampling method currently used by the Province of Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. Exploration of spatial bias within each sampling method was conducted using Kernel Density Estimation, a nonparametric approach to interpolating the spatial trend of a given variable. Results indicate that two distinct patterns of sampling clusters exist between the two datasets, suggesting a cottage effect' in which volunteers are more likely to sample accessible locations associated with recreation and summer home ownership. Although professional monitoring programs are not exempt from spatial bias, our research suggests that citizen science lake monitoring programs in Ontario are more influenced by natural and demographic biases related to the location, accessibility, size and general attractiveness of lakes.					; Melles, Stephanie/NLO-5976-2025	Melles, Stephanie/0000-0002-2983-8136; 													1365-8816	1362-3087				AUG 3	2019	33	8					1612	1632		10.1080/13658816.2018.1423686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2018.1423686													WOS:000471937900007

Use of turbidometry to characterize suspended sediment and phosphorus fluxes in the Lake Tahoe basin, California, USA	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The efficacy of in-stream nephelometric turbidometry as a surrogate for total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations was evaluated for use in low turbidity (< 50 NTU) subalpine watersheds at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA. Continuous turbidity records for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 snowmelt seasons and data from water quality samples (1982-2000) were examined to determine watershed sediment delivery dynamics. Strong correlations were found between turbidity and both TSS and TP concentration. The strong con-elation indicates that turbidity can serve as a good surrogate for direct measurement in these watersheds. The watersheds displayed clockwise hysteresis: sediment flushing and depletion, on daily, seasonal and decadal time-scales. The hysteresis curves had strong concave shapes, indicating a sensitive response to peak flow. A pronounced seasonal trend was observed for the ratio of suspended sediment concentration (SSC)/discharge over time, indicating early season flushing of available sediment. Significant linear relationships (p < 0.05) were found for 12 of 17 years. Comparison of annual sediment rating curve coefficients indicated smaller coefficients during high sediment loading years and in the years following. The smaller coefficients are evidence of sediment depletion during high flow years. The effect of hysteresis on monitoring methods was illustrated by comparing turbidity estimates of TSS load with sediment rating curve estimates of SSC. After accounting for differences in SSC/TSS methods of analysis, daily loads calculated with turbidity methods were 58-98% of rating curve estimates for the spring snowmelt seasons of 1999-2001.

We conducted such investigations during the breeding seasons of 1999 and 2000 in Qinghai-Lake Bird Isle, China. Great Cormorants began to migrate to Qinghai-Lake for reproduction from the middle of March and left from early October at the end of reproduction. Nesting periods were from early April to mid June and took 50 days. Egg-laying occurred during the three weeks from the end of April to 20 May. Females typically laid an egg every 1-2 days until clutch completion. Mean clutch size in the study area over two years was 3.3 (SE +/- 0.13, N = 68, range 1-5) and most (66.18%) fell within the range 3-4 eggs. Length of eggs averaged 61.01 mm and breadth averaged 34.13 mm. Fresh egg weight averaged 57.34 g (SE +/- 0.36, range 46.0-73.7 g, N = 179). Hatching success was 48.7% and fledging success was 64.9% over two years. Decline of available fish resources in Qinghai-Lake might be one of main causes of lower reproductive success. The causes of chick loss were possibly high altitude, high winds and prolonged rain.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2007	30	2					305	309		10.1675/1524-4695(2007)30[305:RBOGCP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2007)30[305:RBOGCP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000248130200019

A late Quaternary chironomid-inferred temperature record from the Sierra Nevada, Califomia, with connections to northeast Pacific sea surface temperatures	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Chironomid remains from a mid-elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada, California, were used to estimate quantitative summer surface water temperatures during the past similar to 15,000 yr. Reconstructed temperatures increased by similar to 3 degrees C between lake initiation and the onset of the Holocene at similar to 10,600 cal yr BP (calibrated years before present). Temperatures peaked at 6500 cal yr BP, displayed high variability from 6500 to 3500 cal yr BP, and stabilized after 3500 cal yr BP. This record generally tracks reconstructed Santa Barbara Basin sea surface temperatures (SSTs) through much of the Holocene, highlighting the correspondence between SST variability and California land temperatures during this interval.

The carbon fixation rate was measured by the use of a 13C tracer after the incubation of samples under light conditions in the upper water column. Photosynthetic fixation of 13C was detected for samples collected from a depth of 500m, indicating the viability of phytoplankton in deep water. The community composition was dominated by Bacillariophyceae in deep water. The finding of lower activity at a depth of 200m than that at a depth of 500m in August suggests that the spring diatom bloom could be a significant source of viable populations at a depth of 500m.

A First Reliable Gravity Tidal Model for Lake Nasser Region (Egypt)	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												In the framework of the French-Egyptian Imhotep Project, two spring gravimeters have been installed in the area of Lake Nasser (Egypt) with the aim to establish a first reliable gravity tide model for the region. The two tidal gravity stations are located in Aswan, on the northern edge of the lake and in Abu Simbel in the south, respectively. This study was mainly aimed to obtain a reliable model of the crustal response to tidal forces and, consequently, to increase the accuracy of the geodetic observations, to be used in future geophysical studies in this region as well as to investigate the effect of the Lake level variations on the crustal deformation and related gravity changes. Nearly 3 years of gravity records (from May 2018 to April 2021) were collected. Since no scale factor was available for the two gravimeters, the first step of this study was to achieve a reliable calibration for each of the two collected gravity signals. After removing the instrumental drift, spikes, steps and tares, both gravimeters have been calibrated by fitting the output signal against a synthetic reference signal based on the body tidal gravity response due to Wahr-Dehant Earth model and FES2014 ocean tidal loading model. The calibrated signals have been analyzed with ET34-X-V80 software for tidal analyses. This enabled us to retrieve a set of frequency-dependent gravity factors (amplitude and phase) for the main tidal waves, as well as to obtain gravity residuals. It turns out that the accuracy of the amplitude estimates for the main tidal waves is 0.2 divided by 1% for LCR_ET16 in Aswan and 1 divided by 10% for the LCR_D-218 in Abu Simbel. To improve the tidal model at Abu Simbel, LCR_ET16 was stopped in Aswan and relocated there. The first 90 days of gravity recordings from ET16 at Abu Simbel provide promising results, with an accuracy of the order of 0.1% for the main tidal waves, even better than the results obtained in Aswan. The residual gravity signal after tidal subtraction at Aswan is in the range of +/- 50 mu Gal. Further analyses of the instrumental contribution are however needed before to be able to interpret this gravity signal in terms of surface loading (i.e. changes in the water level of Lake Nasser) or underground hydrology.

Diatoms of the Southern Part of the Russian Far East	DIATOMS: FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS												The Russian part of the Far East has a well-developed and dense hydrographic network, and there are many rivers (mainly those belonging to the Amur River basin), streams, springs, hot springs, lakes (the largest of which is Khanka), reservoirs, ponds and swamps in this area. The study of the species diversity of freshwater algae in the Far East began 100 years ago with the works of the famous Russian algologist Boris Vladimirovich Skvortzow (Skvortzow 1917a, b; Skvortzow 1918a, b). Studies of the diatom flora have been carried out over the course of a century by many Russian and Japanese scientists, and basic data on the diatom algae of the region are known from the papers of Russian algologists B.W. Skvortzow, I.A. Kisselew, A.P. Zhuze, A.G. Khakhina, V.V. Zhurkina, L.A. Kukharenko, L.A. Medvedeva, S.S. Barinova, and T.V. Nikulina. Currently, 1079 species (1408 intraspecies taxa) of diatom algae from three classes are known from the southern part of the Far East. A complete list of diatoms of the southern Far East has been published in a catalogue (Medvedeva & Nikulina 2014a). The diatom flora of the south part of the Russian Far East includes a number of rare species, and a description of these species is given in this publication. The combination and associations of data on the diatoms of the reservoirs of the continental and insular territories of the south of the Far East are important for determining the significance of the algal flora of the Far Eastern region on a global scale, subsequent comparative analyses using data from the algal flora of neighbouring regions, and the future biogeographic analysis of diatoms.

This is the first study to report the use of computerised tomography (CT) for studying lesions induced by anguillicolosis. Of 50 eels caught by electrofishery from Lake Balaton, Hungary, in autumn 2002 and pre-selected by a conventional X-ray method, 22 specimens were examined with a Siemens Somatom Plus S40 spiral CT scanner. Tomograms, radiographs and photographs of 5 of these, showing anguillicolosis-induced swimbladder lesions of varying severity, are presented. Computerised tomograms provide information on the inner structure, air content and wall thickness of the swimbladder as well as on the number of worms it contains. When the swimbladder is not severely affected or not completely filled with worms, computerised tomography provides adequate data on the shape of the swimbladder, thickness of the swimbladder wall and the location of worms in the lumen. However, in more severe cases, i.e. when the swimbladder is tightly packed with worms or contains no air as a result of wall-thickening, this method fails to determine the number and location of helminths or the thickness of the swimbladder wall.					; Szekely, Csaba/F-5246-2012; Székely, Csaba/V-2655-2019; Hancz, Csaba/E-8385-2016	Szabo, Andras/0000-0002-5315-0024; Molnar, Kalman/0000-0002-6138-7929; Szekely, Csaba/0000-0001-8831-9099; Muller, Tamas/0000-0002-0512-4315; Hancz, Csaba/0000-0001-9730-063X													0177-5103					MAR 10	2004	58	2-3					157	164		10.3354/dao058157	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao058157								15109137					WOS:000221208300008

The taxa richness was significantly greater than reports at the time of the reservoir creation. Spatial variability of the plankton community in the reservoir was statistically homogeneous among sites and the water layers across sites during its stratified period. The river plankton communities followed the same patterns as the reservoir, and river sites were always statistically similar to the reservoir community in terms of richness and abundance. The similarity of the communities across the reservoir and the river was highest during summer. Influential variables explaining seasonal differences in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities included physical, nutrient, and biotic factors. Our study demonstrates how a large, run-of-the-river hydroelectric generating station can regulate the plankton community up to 20 km downstream.

Brian; Fleming, Ian A.; Power, Michael			Overwinter thermal habitat use in lakes by anadromous Arctic char	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and (or) overwinter. Upon freshwater entry, feeding is reduced or absent, and movement activity is restricted. While the physiological responses to low temperatures (e.g., growth, metabolism) are understood, specifics of the use of thermal habitat for overwintering remains poorly characterized. This study used acoustic and archival telemetry data from two lakes in southern Labrador, Canada, to study thermal habitat use during the ice-covered period. Results showed that lake-dwelling anadromous Arctic char predominantly occupied a narrow range of temperatures (0.5-2 degrees C) and used cooler temperatures available within the middle and upper water column. Use of the selected temperatures is likely a strategy that lowers metabolic costs and minimizes energy expenditure, preserving stored lipids for overwinter survival and the energetic costs of preparation for seaward migration. As Arctic char are visual feeders, use of the upper water column is also thought to aid foraging efficiency by increasing the likelihood of prey capture.					; Fleming, Ian/I-7217-2012	Mulder, Ingeborg/0000-0003-1699-9077; Fleming, Ian/0000-0002-5541-824X; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2018	75	12					2343	2353		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0420													WOS:000449791000022

Apart from some advantages such as reducing influence of narrow-band noise, HFM signals provide Doppler-invariability and low power cost. The effects of multipath and Doppler shift on the proposed scheme were investigated by establishing a model of a shallow water acoustic communication system. The emulated results demonstrate that it has a good prospect for underwater acoustic communication system, especially for moving platforms. High transmission stability of this approach was validated in lake experiments carried out in the summer 2011.

We collected clones twice for the experiments, first at the beginning of thermal stratification in May and then towards the end of the season in September. The results for May showed longer postembryonic development (PED), bigger eggs in the first clutch and slightly higher somatic increments in the hypolimnetic clones. In addition, a remarkable tendency to produce ephippia was recorded in the hypolimnetic clones, but not in the epilimnetic clones. In September, the results were reversed-hypolimnetic clones had shorter PED, lower somatic increments and a slightly higher number of eggs in the first clutch. Our results suggest a differentiation of life history traits in the two D. galeata populations inhabiting contrasting microhabitats of a reservoir as a result of (i) different depth preferences of certain clones in the beginning of thermal stratification in spring and (ii) divergent selection processes due to segregation in different environmental conditions. The ability of Daphnia to live in diverse environments, causing divergent selection processes, enhances the overall phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the whole reservoir population.

J	Mitchell, JL				Mitchell, Jonathan L.			TITAN'S TRANSPORT-DRIVEN METHANE CYCLE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS												The mechanisms behind the occurrence of large cloud outbursts and precipitation on Titan have been disputed. A global- and annual-mean estimate of surface fluxes indicated only 1% of the insolation, or similar to 0.04 W m(-2), is exchanged as sensible and/or latent fluxes. Since these fluxes are responsible for driving atmospheric convection, it has been argued that moist convection should be quite rare and precipitation even rarer, even if evaporation globally dominates the surface-atmosphere energy exchange. In contrast, climate simulations indicate substantial cloud formation and/or precipitation. We argue that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance is diagnostic of horizontal heat transport by Titan's atmosphere, and thus constrains the strength of the methane cycle. Simple calculations show the TOA radiative imbalance is similar to 0.5-1 W m(-2) in Titan's equatorial region, which implies 2-3 MW of latitudinal heat transport by the atmosphere. Our simulation of Titan's climate suggests this transport may occur primarily as latent heat, with net evaporation at the equator and net accumulation at higher latitudes. Thus, the methane cycle could be 10-20 times previous estimates. Opposing seasonal transport at solstices, compensation by sensible heat transport, and focusing of precipitation by large-scale dynamics could further enhance the local, instantaneous strength of Titan's methane cycle by a factor of several. A limited supply of surface liquids in regions of large surface radiative imbalance may throttle the methane cycle, and if so, we predict more frequent large storms over the lakes district during Titan's northern summer.																			2041-8205					SEP 10	2012	756	2							L26	10.1088/2041-8205/756/2/L26	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2041-8205/756/2/L26													WOS:000308796500002

Improved detection using negative elevation angles for mountaintop WSR-88Ds. Part III: Simulations of shallow convective activity over and around Lake Ontario	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												During the winter, lake-effect snowstorms that form over Lake Ontario represent a significant weather hazard for the populace around the lake. These storms, which typically are only 2 km deep, frequently can produce narrow swaths ( 20-50 km wide) of heavy snowfall ( 2-5 cm h(-1) or more) that extend 50-75 km inland over populated areas. Subtle changes in the low-altitude flow direction can mean the difference between accumulations that last for 1-2 h and accumulations that last 24 h or more at a given location. Therefore, it is vital that radars surrounding the lake are able to detect the presence and strength of these shallow storms. Starting in 2002, the Canadian operational radars on the northern side of the lake at King City, Ontario, and Franktown, Ontario, began using elevation angles of as low as -0.1 degrees and 0.0 degrees, respectively, during the winter to more accurately estimate snowfall rates at the surface. Meanwhile, Weather Surveillance Radars-1988 Doppler in New York State on the southern and eastern sides of the lake Buffalo ( KBUF), Binghamton ( KBGM), and Montague (KTYX)-all operate at 0.5 degrees and above. KTYX is located on a plateau that overlooks the lake from the east at a height of 0.5 km. With its upward-pointing radar beams, KTYX's detection of shallow lake-effect snowstorms is limited to the eastern quarter of the lake and surrounding terrain. The purpose of this paper is to show-through simulations-the dramatic increase in snowstorm coverage that would be possible if KTYX were able to scan downward toward the lake's surface. Furthermore, if KBUF and KBGM were to scan as low as 0.2 degrees, detection of at least the upper portions of lake-effect storms over Lake Ontario and all of the surrounding land area by the five radars would be complete. Overlake coverage in the lower half ( 0-1 km) of the typical lake-effect snowstorm would increase from about 40% to about 85%, resulting in better estimates of snowfall rates in landfalling snowbands over a much broader area.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				AUG	2007	22	4					839	852		10.1175/WAF1019.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF1019.1													WOS:000248802600010
J	SHAHADY, TD				SHAHADY, TD			IMPACT OF LARVAL DOROSOMA PREDATION ON DAPHNIA-PARVULA DYNAMICS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In reservoirs of the south-eastern United States, Daphnia typically decline in abundance during the summer months. Current understanding suggests that adult shad (Dorosoma spp.), the dominant planktivore in these reservoirs, plays a limited role in Daphnia midsummer declines. The impact of shad larvae is beginning to be documented. 2. To examine the impact of larval shad on Daphnia seasonal dynamics, larval dynamics were studied over two seasons and stomach contents were analysed during one season. 3. Initial Daphnia parvula declines correlated with abundance of shad larvae. During the decline, shad stomach contents consisted of 97-100% D. parvula. After D. parvula declined, Bosmina and Diaphanosoma accounted for up to 97% of larval diets. When shad diets included other cladocerans, D. parvula abundance increased in the reservoir. 4. When this predation pattern was incorporated into a predictive model, larval shad predation accounted for an initial, temporary decline in D. parvula abundance. However, when other crustaceans were incorporated into the shad diet, D. parvula populations increased. 5. These results suggest that larval shad have a temporary, strong influence on the structure and abundance of D. parvula populations in south-eastern reservoirs of the United States.																			0046-5070					OCT	1993	30	2					279	287		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00809.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00809.x													WOS:A1993MF40100009

Myomere counts and size distributions of vendace larvae from the sampling data of springs 1988-1992 were examined in order to investigate more closely the character of this larval mortality In most years the mean pre-anal myomere counts inceased during the larval phase. Small larvae (< 15 mm) exhibited much wider variation in myomere numbers (29-39, mode 37) than early juveniles (> 20 mm) that had 36-38 myomeres (mode 38). The weekly myomere counts showed significant correlations with the larval length. We suggest that larvae with low myomere counts have inferior survival which results in the observed shifts in myomere counts and in apparently high growth rates.

The main objective of the study was to use these modeling tools in order to evaluate the local effect of thermally-induced circulations on large-scale transport of polluted air masses into that area. Results indicated a substantial modification of the transport characteristics due to the local terrain-forced circulations. Most noticeable are: (i) trapping of pollutants within the Lake Powell valley, (ii) upward and downward venting of pollutants in convergence/divergence zones associated with these circulations, and (iii) slowing of cross-valley transport as compared to equivalent situations involved with flat terrain.

There, methane is mainly produced microbially in anoxic sediments from which it can escape to the overlying water column. Aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the water column acts as a biological filter, reducing the amount of methane that eventually evades to the atmosphere. The efficiency of the MOx filter is potentially controlled by the availability of dissolved methane and oxygen, as well as temperature, salinity, and hydro-graphic dynamics, and all of these factors undergo strong temporal fluctuations in coastal ecosystems. In order to elucidate the key environmental controls, specifically the effect of oxygen availability, on MOx in a seasonally stratified and hypoxic coastal marine setting, we conducted a 2-year time-series study with measurements of MOx and physicochemical water column parameters in a coastal inlet in the south-western Baltic Sea (Eckernforde Bay). We found that MOx rates generally increased toward the seafloor, but were not directly linked to methane concentrations. MOx exhibited a strong seasonal variability, with maximum rates (up to 11.6 nmol L-1 d(-1)) during summer stratification when oxygen concentrations were lowest and bottom-water temperatures were highest. Under these conditions, 2.4-19.0 times more methane was oxidized than emitted to the atmosphere, whereas about the same amount was consumed and emitted during the mixed and oxygenated periods. Laboratory experiments with manipulated oxygen concentrations in the range of 0.2-220 mu mol L-1 revealed a submicromolar oxygen optimum for MOx at the study site. In contrast, the fraction of methane-carbon incorporation into the bacterial biomass (compared to the total amount of oxidized methane) was up to 38-fold higher at saturated oxygen concentrations, suggesting a different partitioning of catabolic and anabolic processes under oxygen-replete and oxygen-starved conditions, respectively. Our results underscore the importance of MOx in mitigating methane emission from coastal waters and indicate an organism-level adaptation of the water column methanotrophs to hypoxic conditions.

It belongs to the watershed of the Lerma River, which originates from the Mexico City area, 450 km to the east. Sediment cores, 0.5-2 m long, were collected from the lake. Magnetic susceptibility of the lake sediments generally ranges from 400 to 800 x 10(-9) m(3) kg(-1); but in some layers it exceeds 1000 or 1500 x 10(-9) m(3) kg(-1). The magnetic susceptibility vertical profiles display a thin peak (2-5 cm) or a double peak with magnetic susceptibility > 2000 x 10(-9) m(3) kg(-1). Scanning electron microscope analysis shows that the main mineral responsible for the magnetic susceptibility is titano-magnetite, which is relatively abundant in the magnetic layers. In most of the cores, the layer with magnetic susceptibility > 2000 x 10(-9) m(3) kg(-1) is coarser grained than the directly under and overlying sediments, which are composed of fine silt. But not all coarser levels are magnetic nor are all magnetic levels bound to coarser layers. The high titano-magnetic concentration probably originates from volcanic ash falls. Sedimentation rates, evaluated for several sites by means of the Pb-210 and Cs-137 methods, allow a date approximation (between 1535 and 1670) for the strong magnetic layer deposition. Since important eruptions of Colima Volcano, with ash fall, were reported from 1576 to 1623, the main peak of magnetic susceptibility in the sediment profiles is assumed to be related to these events. The main magnetic layer extends to greater depth in the profiles of the eastern part of the lake plain than at the west. It can, therefore, be suggested that a relative subsidence occurs in the eastern part of the lake; the axis of the eastern plain overlaps the area displaying the maximum subsidence rate and seems therefore to correspond to the prolongation of Citala rift.

Biogeochemical conversion of sulfur species in saline lakes of Steppe Altai	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												The aim of the present research is to identify the main mechanisms of sulfur behavior in saline lakes in the course of time and followed transformations in their chemical composition. The influence of water on chemical composition of biochemical processes involved in decomposition of organic matter was determined by the study of behavior of reduced forms of sulfur in lakes. The determination of reduced forms of sulfur was carried out by successive transfer of each form of sulfur to hydrogen sulfide followed by photometric measurements. The other chemical components were determined by standard methods (atomic absorption, potentiometric method, titration method and others). The salt lakes of the Altai steppe were studied in summer season 2013-2015. Analysis of the chemical composition of the saline lakes of Altai Krai has shown that carbonate-, hydrocarbonate- and chloride ions dominate among anions; sodium is main cation; sulfates are found in subordinate amounts. Reduced forms of sulfur occur everywhere: hydrogen and hydrosulfide sulfur S2- prevail in the bottom sediments; its derivative-elemental S-0-prevails in the lakes water. The second important species in water of soda lakes is hydrosulfide sulfur S2-, and in chloride lakes is thiosulfate sulfur S2O32-. The lag in the accumulation of sulfates in soda lakes in comparison to chloride lakes can be explained by their bacterial reduction, followed by the formation and deposition of iron sulfides in sediments. In chloride lakes gypsum is a predominantly barrier for sulfates.

A correlation of X-ray CT values, as a proxy of relative density, to the marine oxygen isotope record provides an age of 177-183 ka for this reversal excursion. It can be correlated with other excursion records from Lake Baikal, found in Core 287-K2 from Academician Ridge [King et al., Russ. Geol. Geophys. 34 (1993) 148-162] and in core BDP93-1 drilled on the Buguldeika saddle [BDP-93. Quat. Int. 37 (1997) 3-17]. We correlate the Lake Baikal reversal excursion with a well documented excursion in the Brunhes Chron, the Iceland Basin event (186-189 ka) from ODP Sites 983 and 984 in the North Atlantic [Channell, J. Geophys. Res. 104 (1999) 22937-22951]. Also the relative paleointensity record agrees well with that from ODP Site 983 [Channell. J. Geophys. Res. 104 (1999) 22937-22951]. The Lake Baikal excursion and the Iceland Basin event correspond to the minimum of relative intensity at 188 ka in Sint-800 [Guyodo and Valet, Nature 399 (1999) 249-252]. We argue that it is distinct from the Jamaica/Pringle Falls excursion, estimated at 205-215 ka [Langereis et al.. Geophys. J. Int. 129 (1997) 75-94]. This is supported by the recalibration of the age of another excursion found in Core St,16 in Lake Baikal [Sakai et al., Bull, Nagoya Univ. Furukawa Mus. 13 (1997) 11-21] with an age of similar to223 ka, which is close to the age of the Jamaica/Pringle Falls excursion, as suggested earlier [King et al., Russ. Geol. Geophys, 34 (1993) 148-162]. The VGP path of the reversal excursion (177-183 ka) consists of a southward swing through the North Atlantic, followed by a loop through Africa and the Indian Ocean, The path morphology is similar to that of the Iceland Basin event from the North Atlantic [Channell, J, Geophys.

The differences between the faunal composition in the springfed river Kraka and the river Laxa, which forms the outlet of Lake Myvatn, are discussed. Six species are exclusive to Kraka, probably mainly because summer temperatures are lower there than in Laxa. Seven species are exclusive to Laxa.

Various abiotic parameters as well as available food sources (phytoplankton and microphytes (algae and cyanobacteria) developing on epixylon, epilithon and artificially introduced microplastics called "plastisphere") were also studied. The lake was hydrologically isolated from the main river during the study, while the water level of the Drava River fluctuated, resulting in larger variations in limnological parameters. Due to stable conditions in the lake, zooplankton abundance, biomass, and species richness were higher than in the Drava River. In both environments, zooplankton species feeding on bacteria, detrital suspensions, and small algae were most abundant, with predators and microfilter-feeders being more abundant in the lake. Microphytes were diverse and mostly small and medium-sized in phytoplankton and all substrate types. Stable lake conditions promoted higher abundance of the zooplankton group, which effectively uses larger algae as a food source. The lower abundance of zooplankton feeding on larger algae and predatory species in the river suggests that the epilithon and plastisphere community was a less mature community compared to the lake, and the heterotrophic component with ciliates and/or other small heterotrophs was not well developed. The importance of plastispheres was particularly evident under the turbid hydrologic conditions that prevailed in the river at the end of the study, when phytoplankton biomass decreased and zooplankton abundance steadily increased, suggesting that microphytes colonised on microplastics were an additional food source for higher trophic levels.					; Čmelar, Karla/JFS-0126-2023; Galir, Anita/I-9678-2019; Maronic, Dubravka/AAH-3995-2021	, Karla/0009-0003-8279-7024; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				SEP	2022	212		D						113563	10.1016/j.envres.2022.113563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.113563		MAY 2022						35623443					WOS:000824030300002

Species included longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), white sucker (C. commersoni), lake chub (Couesius plumbeus), juvenile sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr and smolt and anadromous brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). In 1980, emigration for all species except the lamprey began on May 27 and ended by June 9-11; lamprey movements began on June 4-5 and peaked on June 10. Similar but slightly later patterns occurred in 1982. Onset of the runs in each year coincided with declining water levels and discharge. Thus, species of widely different habits exhibit similar and highly synchronized migratory patterns, possibly in response to strong changes in stream environment.

The nature and strength of nutrient limitation is driven both by external factors (e.g., nutrient loading) and internal processes (e.g., consumer-driven nutrient regeneration). Here we present results from a field study in 10 low productive headwater lakes in northern subarctic Sweden, where nitrogen (N) deposition is low and phytoplankton is primarily N-limited. We assessed the carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry of seston and zooplankton and estimated the N:P ratio of consumer-driven nutrient regeneration. Based on stoichiometric models, the estimated elemental imbalances between seston and zooplankton suggest that zooplankton were mainly N-limited and regenerated nutrients with low N:P ratios (median 11.9, atomic ratio). The predicted N:P regeneration ratios were consistent with results from phytoplankton nutrient limitation bioassays in mid-summer, i.e., the N:P regeneration was predicted to be low when phytoplankton were N-limited, and high when phytoplankton were P-limited. During other seasons, when water discharge was high, nutrient loading from the surrounding catchments apparently had the strongest effect on phytoplankton nutrient limitation. We propose that lakes with higher N:P ratios than the open ocean is an effect of N deposition, that N-limitation of consumers and phytoplankton is further enhanced by low nutrient regeneration N:P ratios, and that in the absence of N deposition, lake and ocean N:P stoichiometry are similar.

This study sought to evaluate whether phosphorus or nitrogen limitation is an effective approach to control cyanobacterial (Microcystis) blooms in river conditions that favor this non-nitrogen-fixing genus. These conditions include nutrient enrichment, high water temperature, and thermal stratification during summer. Mesocosm bioassays were conducted to investigate the limiting factors for cyanobacterial blooms in a river reach where severe Microcystis blooms occur annually. We evaluated the effect of five different nitrogen (3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 mg/L) and phosphorus 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/L) concentrations on algae growth. The results indicate that nitrogen treatments stimulated cyanobacteria (mostly Microcystis aeruginosa) more than phosphorus. Interestingly, phosphorus additions did not stimulate cyanobacteria, although it did stimulate Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. We conclude that phosphorus reduction might have suppressed the growth of Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae more than that of cyanobacteria; therefore, nitrogen or at least both nitrogen and phosphorus control appears more effective than phosphorus reductions alone for reducing cyanobacteria in river conditions that are favorable for non-nitrogen-fixing genera.

Both populations spawned over upwelling groundwater. In the lake site fish deposited eggs 7-19 cm in the sediment in an egg pocket that contained large-particle substrate. A similar vertical distribution of eggs (16-20 cm) and substrate occurred in the stream; however, in addition to the digging action of the female, the flow conditions in the stream appeared to produce coarser surface sediment conditions. Groundwater offered a high concentration of dissolved oxygen and, relative to lake water, less variable temperature and pH regimes for incubating eggs. Alevin emergence extended over a 71-day period, coinciding with the spring thaw and an episodic pH depression.					Curry, R./ABG-3515-2020; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Curry, R.

Classification of Groundwater Quality for Irrigation Purposes in Wetland Region by Irrigation Water Quality Index	WATER RESOURCES												The current study was conducted to classify the quality of groundwater in wetlands. This research was carried out to evaluate the groundwater quality of wells in the surrounding area according to the Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) to verify its suitability for agricultural purposes. The IWQI was developed in 2010 by Meireles; it was calculated based on the water quality parameters: EC, Na+1, Mg+2, Ca+2, Cl-1, and HCO3-1 of 37 monitoring wells. The results of the IWQI show that the water quality declined significantly in July, with the majority of wells 76% within the severe restriction category (SR), which means that it's suitable only for irrigation of crops with high salt tolerance, and 14% of wells falling within the High Restriction category (HR). The lake's discharge decreases during the dry season, and most of the water quality classified as a severe restriction (SR), this indicates that the groundwater is influenced by the saline waters of Lake Fetzara, which are already loaded with chemical elements due to evaporation. As a result, the study of groundwater suitability for irrigation revealed that these waters are generally acceptable for irrigation of salt-tolerant crops on well-drained soils but require a prior control of salinity evolution.

Here, we quantify and characterize microplastics in subsurface water and zooplankton from eight lakes in BC, Canada. By sampling water and zooplankton, we provide insight into the fraction of microplastics entering the food web. We found 0.607 +/- 0.153 microplastics per litre in subsurface water, 0.01 +/- 0.011 microplastics per copepod, and 0.02 +/- 0.014 microplastics per Daphnia. Microplastic pollution was similar in all lakes sampled and showed no relationship with local population density. Fibers were the dominant morphology observed in all lakes, and Raman spectroscopy identified polyester as the dominant polymer found both in lakes and within zooplankton. Zooplankton generally ingested microplastics that were shorter than their body length and that fell on the smaller end of the range of available microplastics. The prominence of polyester fibers and PET films and fragments suggests that the likely sources of microplastics to these lakes are recreational activities and atmospheric deposition.

J	Powell, JL				Powell, James Lawrence			Premature rejection in science: The case of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis	SCIENCE PROGRESS												The progress of science has sometimes been unjustifiably delayed by the premature rejection of a hypothesis for which substantial evidence existed and which later achieved consensus. Continental drift, meteorite impact cratering, and anthropogenic global warming are examples from the first half of the twentieth century. This article presents evidence that the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis (YDIH) is a twenty-first century case. The hypothesis proposes that the airburst or impact of a comet similar to 12,850 years ago caused the ensuing similar to 1200-year-long Younger Dryas (YD) cool period and contributed to the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna in the Western Hemisphere and the disappearance of the Clovis Paleo-Indian culture. Soon after publication, a few scientists reported that they were unable to replicate the critical evidence and the scientific community at large came to reject the hypothesis. By today, however, many independent studies have reproduced that evidence at dozens of YD sites. This article examines why scientists so readily accepted the early false claims of irreproducibility and what lessons the premature rejection of the YDIH holds for science.

Bernhart			Biogenic structures in exhumed surfaces around saline lakes: An example from Lake Bogoria, Kenya Rift Valley	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Five overprinted suites of animal and plant traces around saline, alkaline Lake Bogoria, Kenya, are described from a set of interfingering Late Pleistocene and Holocene exhumed surfaces that reveal a complex story of changes in lake level and environmental controls on trace assemblages through time. These stratigraphic surfaces are amalgamated and form a co-planar surface. The sediments were first deposited during intermediate lake levels, then reworked and cemented during low lake levels, and were subsequently overlain by transgressive lacustrine sediments during higher lake levels. Ongoing exhumation of the surface near the present shoreline has reactivated the sediments as a substrate for the activities of epifaunal and infaunal animals, as well as plant growth. The modem environmental setting at Lake Bogoria is very similar to that of the preserved exhumed surfaces, which allows comparisons between observed sets of environmental factors affecting animal behaviour and their representation in the fossilized examples. Pronounced lateral environmental heterogeneity around saline and hypersaline lakes may lead to concentrations of life around sites with vital resources, such as freshwater. At Lake Bogoria, groups of fault-controlled hot springs represent these "oases", and have been a relatively consistent feature in and around the lake during the development of the exhumed surfaces. Together, the diverse assemblage of animal trace suites from Lake Bogoria represent the Mermia and Scoyenia ichnolfacies, but can be divided into five suites that reveal details of laterally heterogeneous sets of environmental factors, and are useful indicators of lake level, substrate moisture content. substrate cohesion, etc. Suite 1 comprises the traces of chironomid larvae (Diptera: Chironomidae) formed in subaqueous lacustrine settings. Suite 2 includes the traces of flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor and Phoenicopterus tuber) formed at the shoreline. Suite 3 compares well with the Mermia ichnofacies and comprises trails and burrow systems associated with relatively fresh, saturated to extremely shallow subaqueous substrates. Suite 4 is comparable to both the pre- and post-desiccation suites of the Scoyenia ichnofacies, is the most diverse suite at Lake Bogoria, and mainly comprises the burrows of beetles, earwigs, and their larvae as well as a diverse set of rhizoliths and vertebrate tracks. Suite 5 contains a moderately diverse set of traces attributed to termites and ants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Formation of subaerial taliks in Larsemann hills, princess Elizabeth land, East Antarctica	POLAR SCIENCE												This study presents a mathematical model of heat and mass transfer for modelling the formation and evolution of taliks in the upper subsurface of the Larsemann Hills in East Antarctica. Four simulation scenarios were considered. The first one showed that thawed areas cannot form under snowfields. The second and third scenarios demonstrated the taliks did not form if the snow melted immediately after set the positive air temperatures and covered the surface 20 days before the set of negative air temperatures or immediately after that. According to the last scenario, talik forms when snow cover persists even with positive air temperature, and snow falls before the air temperature becomes negative. Modelling demonstrates that taliks in the Larsemann Hills exist, but they are mostly in an unstable state.

The Climate Research Branch (CRB) of the Meteorological Service of Canada has investigated snow-cover variations over the MAGS region using snow water equivalent (SWE) datasets derived from Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) passive-microwave satellite data for the winter seasons 1988-98. The SWE datasets were derived using four CRB algorithms for prairie, coniferous-forest, deciduous-forest and sparse-forest land-cover types and then evaluated against available in situ SAVE measurements for MAGS sub-basins. Overall, the SWE algorithms produce reliable estimates (within 10-20 mm of in situ SWE measurements) for the validated part of the MAGS region, although some areas exhibit underestimations of > 30 mm, which may be due to the presence of a high density of lakes or a decreased microwave sensitivity to high-SWE conditions (> 100 mm). A time-series dataset of SSM/I-derived SWE for I March of each year from 1988 to 1998 has been produced as a MAGS deliverable, which provides important information on the spatial and temporal variability in snow cover over the Mackenzie River basin. This dataset has been used in the assessment of snow-cover outputs from MAGS hydrological and climate-modelling investigations.																			0260-3055		0-946417-29-6				2002	34						8	14		10.3189/172756402781817680	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756402781817680													WOS:000177565100002

Two hundred eighty samples were collected in seventy stations during four different seasons. Sequential extraction procedures were carried out to define the chemical forms of the metals, in order to better understand the hazardousness of these pollutants, emphasizing the anthropogenic pressure of the sites studied. Different parameters were used to describe the contamination of these metals in the river basin: the Contamination Factor (CF), the Degree of Contamination (C-d), the Enrichment Index (El), the Individual Contamination Factor (ICF), and the Global Contamination Factor (GCF). By means of a risk assessment methodology, it was calculated that during summer the river system was exposed to a moderate potential ecological risk and that the other three seasons highlighted relatively lower degrees of contamination. Pb and Zn were the metals of most concern with respect to the system pollution, first of all in the form of oxide phases. The metal amounts in the form of oxide phases appeared to be very important also for metals such as Co and Cr. Different metals occurred in critical concentrations in various stations near Potenza town (Industrial Area). The anthropogenic pressure of Tl and V seemed to be lower than for the other metals. The relations between clay minerals and Co, Cr, Ni amounts highlighted the importance of clay minerals for favouring the complexation of these elements by organic matter. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Turbidity increases behavioural diversity in northern pike, Esox lucius L., during early summer	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY					7th Conference on Fish Telemetry	JUN 17-21, 2007	Silkeborg, DENMARK					Optimal behavioural strategies of aquatic organisms may change with environmental conditions such as turbidity. It was hypothesised that pike, Esox lucius L., adapts to low visibility and potential-reduced foraging opportunities by an increase in activity and pelagic residence in turbid conditions. Diel activity and habitat use of pike (57-85 cm) were studied in a turbid lake and a clear-water lake by tracking 31 radio-tagged pike during two diurnal tracking sessions in June 2006. A significant interaction between lake and total length of pike was found, suggesting a higher activity level in large pike in the turbid lake. In addition, pike exhibited a higher among-individual variance in movement and habitat use in the turbid lake. These results suggest a higher degree of behavioural diversity in pike in the turbid lake as a response to low visibility and a resulting change in foraging conditions.

Ecology and phenology of flowering rush in the Detroit Lakes chain of lakes, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Flowering rush, Butomus umbellatus L., has been an increasing problem in the Detroit Lakes chain of lakes for more than 40 yr. Flowering rush dominates ecosystems by crowding out native species, including hardstem bulrush, Schoenoplectus acutus (Muhl. ex Bigelow) A & D Love, a vital part of native ecosystems. Furthermore, flowering rush creates boating hazards and hampers recreational activities on the lakes. The phenological differences between flowering rush and the native hardstem bulrush were examined as part of a project to determine best management practices for controlling this invasive species. Biomass allocation, plant height, carbohydrate allocation, and reproductive structures of flowering rush were examined in the Detroit Lakes system. Flowering rush and hardstem bulrush exhibited similar times of emergence, maximal growth, and senescence, thus requiring careful management to protect the native species. Hardstem bulrush was approximately 1 m taller than flowering rush during midsummer. Flowering rush continually formed rhizome buds as its primary mode of reproduction, and approximately one bud for every 2 g of rhizome, or 393 buds m(-2), were produced within the midst of a flowering rush bed. These high densities of rhizome buds could lead to further spread of flowering rush as well as require long-term treatment of this propagule bank. The number of leaves sprouting from rhizomes was greatest in midsummer in both 2010 and 2011. Throughout summer, 69% of the biomass of flowering rush plants was found below ground, indicating treatment efforts will need to target a reduction of belowground material, potentially over several years.																			0146-6623					JAN	2015	53						54	63																WOS:000367964700008
J	Sullivan, PF; Welker, JM				Sullivan, PF; Welker, JM			Warming chambers stimulate early season growth of an arctic sedge: results of a minirhizotron field study	OECOLOGIA												We examined the effects of passive open-top warming chambers on Eriophorum vaginatum production near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA. During the 2002 growing season, chamber warming was consistent with the magnitude and seasonality observed in recent decades throughout northwestern North America. Leaf-growth rates were higher in late May and early June; maximum growth rates in each leaf cohort occurred earlier and peak biomass was observed 20 days earlier within the chambers. Consequently, plants within the chambers maintained more live leaf biomass during the period of highest photosynthetically active radiation. Annual leaf production within the chambers ( 21 +/- 2 mg tiller) was not significantly different than under ambient conditions ( 17 +/- 2 mg tiller) ( P = 0.2256) despite higher early-season growth rates. Root growth began earlier; growth rates were higher in late May and early June, and maximum growth rates occurred earlier within the chambers. Therefore, plants within the chambers maintained greater root biomass during what earlier studies have identified as a period of relatively high nutrient availability. Annual root production within the chambers ( 191 +/- 42 g m(-2)) was not significantly different than under ambient conditions ( 119 +/- 48 g m(-2\)) ( P = 0.1979), although there was a trend toward higher production within the chambers. The tendency toward higher root production within the chambers is consistent with previous laboratory experiments and with the predictions of biomass allocation theory.					; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013	Sullivan, Patrick/0000-0002-8015-3036; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				FEB	2005	142	4					616	626		10.1007/s00442-004-1764-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1764-3								15688218					WOS:000226766400013

However, the limited timespan of existing measurements has resulted in a poor understanding of the long-term processes and mechanisms underlying erosion in the region. Changes in the 14C reservoir age in enclosed lacustrine sediments are linked to the input of old carbon into lakes due to erosion. These changes can, to some extent, reflect the intensity of erosion within the surrounding catchment. In this study, we analyzed a sediment core GH09B from the central part of Gonghai Lake, a hydrologically closed alpine lake located on the northeastern margin of the CLP. The core provides a high-precision chronological framework spanning approximately the last 14.7 ka, based on 25 AMS 14C dates of terrestrial plant remains. To complement this, we obtained 24 AMS 14C dates of bulk samples within the same core (GH09B). By comparing the 14C ages of the bulk samples with those of terrestrial plant remains at corresponding depths, we reconstructed changes in the 14C reservoir age of Gonghai Lake on a millennial timescale during the Holocene. The results reveal that the 14C reservoir age was more pronounced during the early and late Holocene, while it was comparatively smaller during the middle Holocene. Drawing on high-resolution paleoclimate data from Gonghai Lake, we propose that during the middle Holocene, a relatively stronger East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) fostered greater vegetation coverage, which enhanced soil and water conservation, mitigated erosion, and, a result, reduced the carbon reservoir effect. In contrast, the weaker EASM during the early and late Holocene, coupled with lower vegetation coverage, led to increased erosion intensity and stronger carbon reservoir effect. Changes in vegetation coverage, primarily driven by fluctuations in the EASM, were the primary factor influencing catchment erosion intensity in the CLP during the Holocene.

The investigation focused on analyses of grain size, magnetic susceptibility, ratios of elemental contents, and pollen assemblage from a loess-paleosol sequence. The results indicate that the climate was wet during 5830-4900 cal yr BP, which promoted the development of early-mid Majiayao culture in eastern Qinghai Province. However, 4900-4700 cal yr BP were drought years in the region, responsible for the decline and eastward movement of prehistoric culture during the period of transition from early-mid to late Majiayao culture. The climate turned wet again during 4700-3940 cal yr BP, which accelerated the spread of Qijia culture to the middle reaches of the Huangshui River, including the Changning site.

J	Millard, ES; Myles, DD; Johannsson, OE; Ralph, KM				Millard, ES; Myles, DD; Johannsson, OE; Ralph, KM			Phytoplankton photosynthesis at two index stations in Lake Ontario 1987-1992: Assessment of the long-term response to phosphorus control	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phytoplankton photosynthesis was measured from May to late October at two stations in Lake Ontario from 1987 to 1992, and published data from the International Field Year for the Great Lakes (IFYGL) in 1972 were reanalyzed. Our measurements indicate that seasonal phytoplankton photosynthesis (May 1 - October 31) may have declined about 30% since IFYGL. An empirical relationship between seasonal phytoplankton photosynthesis and mean phosphorus concentration indicates that the estimate of offshore seasonal PP by the Lake Ontario Nutrient Assessment Study (LONAS) in 1982 was unusually low (44%) compared with that predicted from phosphorus concentration. Accurate assessment of long-term change in productivity has been hampered by lack of adequate base-line data from the past. Annual variability in seasonal phytoplankton photosynthesis was remarkably low at both stations during our study with the exception of anomalously low results in 1988. Long-term changes in phytoplankton photosynthesis are probably associated more with declining summer chlorophyll levels than with changes in photosynthetic capacity or its response to temperature. The importance of subepilimnetic photosynthesis, interstation differences in transparency, and seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity as controlling factors for areal phytoplankton photosynthesis is presented. The implication of lower lake productivity for fisheries and lake management is also discussed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1996	53	5					1092	1111		10.1139/cjfas-53-5-1092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-5-1092													WOS:A1996VM91000014

Factors affecting seasonality of lithogenic and biogenic particle flux in a large estuarine ecosystem	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Seasonal patterns of vertical flux over two years (2001-2003) at two stations in the Bras d'Or Lakes, a large estuary in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, were determined using aluminum and organic carbon in settled particles collected in moored traps to calculate lithogenic (terrigenous) and marine biogenic fractions. On an annual basis, lithogenic material comprised 53% and 81% of dry weight and 48% and 66% of organic carbon in settled particles at the deep- (128 m) and shallow-water (41 m) locations, respectively. Peaks in runoff, inferred from rain and snowfall precipitation, ice cover and possible horizontal transport of resuspended sediment coincided with maximum sedimentation rates of lithogenic material during unstratified periods between October and March. Biological factors correlated with phytoplankton and ice algal primary production and seasonal changes in zooplankton grazing inferred from phaeopigments controlled biogenic particle fluxes under stratified conditions between June and September and during winter. Year-to-year variations in deposition of lithogenic and marine biogenic material depended on seasonal differences in stratification, precipitation, freeze/melt conditions and the extent of ice cover.

Physical controls on the spatial evolution of a dinoflagellate bloom in a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A set of satellite images of chlorophyll a concentration for Lake Kinneret (Israel) from the period February to April 2007 captured the temporal evolution of horizontal patchiness that developed during the typical spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. Narrow bands of high concentration located adjacent to the shoreline at the start of the bloom were followed by progressive propagation of this high-concentration region from the shoreline toward the center of the lake as the bloom proceeded. A three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model and an analytical model for a flat-bottomed elliptical basin together explain the observed phenomenon. The spatial structure of Kelvin waves, which were demonstrated to most likely be present in February and April due to resonance, produced regions of high velocity gradient, contributing to horizontal dispersion close to the shoreline. This region of high dispersion was narrow and close to the shoreline at the start of the bloom when the Burger number was relatively small, but it widened over the course of the season as the Burger number increased due to increasing stratification. In addition, an increase in the dispersion rate with time in the lake interior was inferred from numerical simulation due to increasing wind speeds and a thinner surface layer. Physical processes, in this case, horizontal dispersion as a result of both Kelvin waves and wind, can play an important role in governing the dynamics and spatial evolution of dinoflagellate blooms in lakes.					; Hipsey, Matthew/C-3551-2009	Hipsey, Matthew/0000-0001-8386-4354; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2011	56	6					2265	2281		10.4319/lo.2011.56.6.2265	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.6.2265													WOS:000299349700026

However, the ecological responses of water quality change and phytoplankton community succession to the enclosure culture ban remain largely unknown. In this study, we conducted field investigations monthly in East Taihu Lake to present a comprehensive study of water quality and phytoplankton community variation before (2018) and after (2019) the enclosure culture ban. With the cessation of aquaculture activities, water quality significantly improved, TN and TP decreased by 54% and 34%, respectively, and eutrophic state shifted from light eutrophic (mean TSI = 59) to mesotrophic status (mean TSI = 48) in autumn. Chl-a decreased from 33.34 +/- 16.87 to 24.84 +/- 15.43 mu g/L, and SDD increased from 0.76 +/- 0.19 to 0.95 +/- 0.36 m. Meanwhile, phytoplankton abundance significantly decreased from 3.6 x 10(7) to 1.6 x 10(7) cell/L, with the contribution of Cyanophyta markedly decreasing from 82% to 63%. In addition, the heterogeneity of phytoplankton community markedly increased. The changes in water quality and phytoplankton following the enclosure culture ban were largely due to the suspension of external nutrient input from breeding activity and improved water clarity. Redundancy analysis (RDA) analysis further elucidated that water temperature and nutrients were the main factors affecting phytoplankton dynamics. Our findings showed that the ban on enclosure culture had an extremely positive ecological impact.					; li, jian/IAQ-2794-2023; Huang, Qinghui/E-5157-2011	Jing, Nan/0000-0002-2904-562X; Huang, Qinghui/0000-0001-5770-6694; 													1355-557X	1365-2109				JAN	2022	53	1					221	231		10.1111/are.15568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.15568		SEP 2021											WOS:000695856400001

Evaluating Water Lead Levels During the Flint Water Crisis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In April 2014, the drinking water source in Flint, Michigan was switched from Lake Huron water with phosphate inhibitors to Flint River water without corrosion inhibitors. The absence of corrosion control and use of a more corrosive source increased lead leaching from plumbing. Our city-wide citizen science water lead results contradicted official claims that there was no problem- our 90th percentile was 26.8 mu g/L, which was almost double the Lead and Copper Rule action level of 15 mu g/L. Back calculations of a LCR sampling pool with 50% lead pipes indicated an estimated 90th percentile lead value of 31.7 mu g/L (+/- 4.3 mu g/L). Four subsequent sampling efforts were conducted to track reductions in water lead after the switch back to Lake Huron water and enhanced corrosion control. The incidence of water lead varied by service line material. Between August 2015 and November 2016, median water lead reduced from 3.0 to <1 mu g/L for homes with copper service lines, 7.2-1.9 mu g/L with galvanized service lines, and 9.9-2.3 mu g/L with lead service lines. As of summer 2017, our 90th percentile of 7.9 mu g/L no longer differed from official results, which indicated Flint's water lead levels were below the action level.

Reservoirs are hotspots of nitrogen cycling in peatland catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study presents input-output budgets of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) for a reservoir in a peatland catchment in the south Pennines (UK). This site receives high levels of atmospheric inorganic N deposition, in the range of 26kgNha(-1) yr(-1). The results show that the reservoir retains similar to 21 to 31% of the annual TDN input (8806 +/- 741kgN). Approximately 39 to 55% of DON (3782 +/- 653kgN) and 6 to 13% of DIN (5024 +/- 349kgN) were retained/processed. A long water retention time (104days), average annual pH of 6.5, high concentrations of DIN in the reservoir water and a deep water column suggest that denitrification is potentially a key mechanism of N retention/removal. The results also demonstrate that DON is potentially photodegraded and utilized within the reservoir, particularly during the summer season when 58 to 80% of DON input (682 +/- 241kgN) was retained, and a net export of DIN (similar to 34kgN) was observed. The findings therefore suggest that DON may play a more crucial role in the biogeochemistry of peat-dominated acid sensitive upland freshwater systems than previously thought. Reservoirs, impoundments and large lakes in peatland catchments may be important sites in mediating downstream N transport and speciation. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A single mitochondrial haplotype and nuclear genetic differentiation in sympatric colour morphs of a riverine cichlid fish	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Some of the diversity of lacustrine cichlid fishes has been ascribed to sympatric divergence, whereas diversification in rivers is generally driven by vicariance and geographic isolation. In the riverine Pseudocrenilabrus philander species complex, several morphologically highly distinct populations are restricted to particular river systems, sinkholes and springs in southern Africa. One of these populations consists of a prevalent yellow morph in sympatry with a less frequent blue morph, and no individuals bear intermediate phenotypes. Genetic variation in microsatellites and AFLP markers was very low in both morphs and one single mtDNA haplotype was fixed in all samples, indicating a very young evolutionary age and small effective population size. Nevertheless, the nuclear markers detected low but significant differentiation between the two morphs. The data suggest recent and perhaps sympatric divergence in the riverine habitat.					; Koblmüller, Stephan/AFI-3908-2022; Tomljanović, Tea/ACO-2621-2022	Koblmuller, Stephan/0000-0002-1024-3220; Sefc, Kristina/0000-0001-8108-8339; 													1010-061X	1420-9101				JAN	2008	21	1					362	367		10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01443.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01443.x								18021203					WOS:000251765600035
J	Marszalek, H; Górniak, D				Marszalek, Henryk; Gorniak, Dorota			Changes in water chemistry along the newly formed High Arctic fluvial-lacustrine system of the Brattegg Valley (SW Spitsbergen, Svalbard)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Changes in water chemistry along the High Arctic fluvial-lacustrine system located in Wedel Jarlsberg Land in the SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard) were investigated during the summer season of 2010 and 2011. The newly formed river-lake system consists of three lakes connected with the Brattegg River. The first bathymetric measurements of these lakes were made by the authors in 2010. The Brattegg River catchment represents a partly glaciered Arctic water system. The studied lakes are characterized by low mineralization and temperature of water. The value of the electrolytic conductivity (EC) ranges from 30.2 to 50.5 mu S cm(-1) and the temperature of surface water from 1.5 to 7.8 degrees C. The temperature increase takes place downstream starting from Upper Lake to the outflow from Myrktjorna Lake. The waters of lakes have higher temperatures than the stream. The predominant ions are HCO3- (up to 16.5 mg L-1), Cl- (6.66-8.53 mg L-1), Ca2+ (2.40-4.45 mg L-1) and Na+ (2.65-3.36 mg L-1). The highest values of ammonium and DOC found in the lowest Myrktjorna Lake seem to be related to the presence of aquatic organisms and also birds. From the group of 10 analyzed microelements, increased concentrations of aluminum, up to almost 500 mu g L-1, are present in the lakes' water. Water isotopic composition ranges for delta O-18 and delta H-2, from -10.6 to -10.9% and from -70.8 to -72.3%, respectively. The vertical zonality of lake waters is manifested in a decrease in the temperature and increase in EC and chemical elements concentrations.

Based on 3600 scenarios in Hydrus-1D simulation, this study revealed the integrated effects of rainfall characteristics (rainfall amount, maximum rainfall intensity or MRI, time distribution characteristics of rainfall or TDC), antecedent moisture and the season on deep percolation (DP) at a forest site in Taihu Lake Basin, China. Results showed that Hydrus-1D model can well simulate the soil water dynamics at this site. Antecedent moisture had the greatest relative contribution to DP (85.7%), followed by rainfall amount (10.9%) and MRI (3.4%). As the antecedent moisture increased, the relative contribution of the season on DP increased from 0.0% to 16.4%. In comparison, that of MRI decreased from 58.7% to 38.5% and that of rainfall amount followed a bell shape pattern (greatest when the antecedent moisture was 0.26 m(3) m(-3)). The relative contribution of antecedent moisture to DP in summer was the greatest (87.8%), while that of the rainfall was the least. The TDC influenced DP by affecting the responses of DP to other factors. When the rainfall amount was >= 80 mm and the antecedent moisture content was >= 0.34 m(3) in(-3), effect of TDC on DP could be observed. The DP of TDC_B (rainfall intensity linearly increased with time) was the lowest, while that of TDC_E (rainfall intensity kept constant with time) was the greatest. Findings of this study have practical significance for investigating the water and pollutant transport in vadose zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

E. clevei is widely reported but usually rare in many north temperate large-lake systems and fossil deposits. This taxon is characterized by its large size, two rimoportulae per valve, a small pseudoseptum that is overlapped by the valvocopula, spinules on the dorsal and ventral valve margins, an internal proximal raphe hook, sternum on the valve face, coarsely areolate striae in LM, and epithemioid frustular symmetry (heteropolarity in the transapical plane) because of dorsally expanded mantles and cingular elements. This combination of characters clearly differentiates E. clevei from Eunotia sensu stricto; however, some of these characters are shared with other eunotioid genera such as Desmogonium, Semiorbis, Peronia, Actinella, and Eunophora, suggesting that Eunotia clevei, its varieties, and allied taxa may be better placed within a new genus.

While energy and matter fluxes have been more intensely studied over land surfaces, a large proportion of lakes have either been neglected or parameterised with simple bulk approaches. Therefore, turbulent fluxes were measured over wet grassland and a shallow lake with a single eddy-covariance complex at the shoreline in the Nam Co basin in summer 2009. Footprint analysis was used to split observations according to the underlying surface, and two sophisticated surface models were utilised to derive gap-free time series. Results were then compared with observations and simulations from a nearby eddy-covariance station over dry grassland, yielding pronounced differences. Observations and footprint integrated simulations compared well, even for situations with flux contributions including grassland and lake. The accessibility problem for EC measurements on lakes can be overcome by combining standard meteorological measurements at the shoreline with model simulations, only requiring representative estimates of lake surface temperature.

A positive correlation between delta C-13 of silver carp and that of seston suggested that temporal variation Of delta C-13 in seston was preserved in fish via the food chain. The differences of delta C-13 among seston, zooplankton and muscle tissue of silver carp and bighead carp ranged only 0.2-1.7%, indicating that plankton production was the primary food source of filter-feeding fishes. According to a mass balance model, we estimated that the contributions of zooplankton to the diets of silver carp and bighead carp were 45.7% and 54.3%, respectively, based on the delta N-15 values of zooplankton and planktivorous fishes.

Gary			Integrated organismal responses induced by projected levels of CO2 and temperature exposures in the early life stages of lake sturgeon	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Atmospheric CO2 and temperature are rising concurrently, and may have profound impacts on the transcriptional, physiological and behavioural responses of aquatic organisms. Further, spring snowmelt may cause transient increases of pCO(2) in many freshwater systems. We examined the behavioural, physiological and transcriptomic responses of an ancient fish, the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) to projected levels of warming and pCO(2) during its most vulnerable period of life, the first year. Specifically, larval fish were raised in either low (16 degrees C) or high (22 degrees C) temperature, and/or low (1000 mu atm) or high (2500 mu atm) pCO(2) in a crossed experimental design over approximately 8 months. Following overwintering, lake sturgeon were exposed to a transient increase in pCO(2) of 10,000 mu atm, simulating a spring melt based on data in freshwater systems. Transcriptional analyses revealed potential connections to otolith formation and reduced growth in fish exposed to high pCO(2) and temperature in combination. Network analyses of differential gene expression revealed different biological processes among the different treatments on the edges of transcriptional networks. Na+/K+-ATPase activity increased in fish not exposed to elevated pCO(2) during development, and mRNA abundance of the beta subunit was most strongly predictive of enzyme activity. Behavioural assays revealed a decrease in total activity following an acute CO2 exposure. These results demonstrate compensatory and compounding mechanisms of pCO(2) and warming dependent on developmental conditions in lake sturgeon. Conserved elements of the cellular stress response across all organisms provide key information for how other freshwater organisms may respond to future climate change.					; Thorstensen, Matt/AAC-8756-2022; Loeppky, Alison/AAG-7439-2019; Quijada-Rodriguez, Alex/GLR-8795-2022; Yoon, Gwangseok/AAH-4714-2021	Thorstensen, Matt/0000-0002-7870-3369; Yoon, Gwangseok/0000-0001-5557-8692; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				JUL	2024	33	14								10.1111/mec.17432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.17432		JUN 2024						38887831					WOS:001249453800001

The change in water export between pre(1983) and post-fire (1998 to 2000) periods was higher in the burned (4th order) than reference stream (3rd order) (P = 0.01). Burned to reference stream ratios of particulate P (PP) flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMC) and export were 1.5 and 2.8, respectively, in year 1 and 2.8 and 6.7, respectively, in year 2 post-fire. Particulate P comprised a similar proportion of total P export in the burned stream before fire and in the reference stream (65%), but a higher proportion after fire during the peakflow season only (77%) (P < 0.02). Phosphorus concentration and discharge (Q) were positively related in both streams, across all Q intensities measured in the case of dissolved P, but only at Q > 1.5 m(3) s(-1) for PP. Changes in P export after fire were evident during peakflow and were largely restricted to the PP fraction. These changes appear to be driven by higher discharge, which enhanced loading of P-rich particulates from the watershed and (or) from the stream channel.																			1496-2551						2003	2			1			S63	S72		10.1139/S03-036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/S03-036													WOS:000220376600008

Microbial abundance in the lake water was from 1.59 105 to 3.37 105 cells mL- 1, and bacteria were evenly distributed in the lake due to its uniform water physical-chemistry. Obtained isolates were affiliated with -, - and -Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, among which -Proteobacteria isolates were dominant. Retrieved bacterial 16S rRNA gene clones fell into -, - and -Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Chloroflexi. Bacterial diversity in Lake Puma Yumco was higher than that in other Tibetan lakes at levels of both phyla and clusters. A half of total clones in Lake Puma Yumco were members of the widespread typical freshwater bacterial clusters.

This is demonstratred with a data set from the pelagic area of an oligo-mesotrophic lake in Central Spain during 61 consecutive days of Autumn overturn. Abiotic variables, phytoplankton species and their total biomass were traced. Species abundance and specific biomass were considered as indices of community structure and resource partitioning, respectively. Abiotic and algal data sets were subjected to factor analyses of cases separately. Atmospheric forcing and nitrogen could be considered as the main (2) driving variables of the abiotic matrix. The coupling of motile abilities and cell size was associated to the main factors of the community structure matrix whereas phosphorus limitation and species responses to buoyancy represented the main factors of the biomass matrix. Coordinates of the two first factors could be used to mimic the trajectories in the data space. Significant short term lags (1-4 days) were found in most time series. Lagged responses of atmospheric forcing and nitrogen on phytoplankton community structure and resource partitioning at scales of 1-7 days were also shown. Overall phytoplankton biomass did not show significant delayed responses, thereby suggesting that it might be resulting from the interplay of other non-studied factors.

These varieties in habitats provide good shelters and foraging sites for migratory birds during their journeys between Eurasia and Africa. Since the beginning of the Libyan winter census of waterbirds International waterbirds census (Libya IWC) in 2005, which continued regularly until 2012, it has had relatively the same performance in the number of covered sites. However, since 2013, due to the security situation that Libya has experienced due to wars and conflict, which negatively affected the quality of the IWC in Libya, the number of sites has dramatically decreased, reaching only six locations during the middle of the previous decade. Aim: The IWC 2022 aimed to count the birds along the Libyan coast from January 10 to 29. Methods: The census activities were conducted from dawn to dusk during the study period by using high-quality Telescopes, binoculars, and digital cameras for the documentation. Point transects method was used to cover the sites. Results: The results of this year showed that a total of 64 sites were covered, and 68 species of waterbirds were counted, with an abundance of 61,850 individuals. During the census period, a total of 52 non-waterbird species found in Wetlands were recorded, and the number of individuals was 14,836 birds. A total of 18 threatened species were observed during this survey, 12 of them are mentioned in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, and nine species are mentioned in the regional activities center of specially protected areas annex II as threatened in the Mediterranean, where the species; Larus audouinii (Payraudeau, 1826), Larus genei (Breme, 1839), and Puffinus Conclusion: The lack of the number of ornithologists and bird watchers is still one of the factors affecting the quality of the IWC in Libya, as well as lack of funding remains an important factor that plays a major role in the success of the waterbirds census.

Late Occupation of the High-Elevation Northern Tibetan Plateau Based on Cosmogenic, Luminescence, and Radiocarbon Ages	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Be-10-Al-26 cosmogenic surface exposure, optically stimulated luminescence, and radiocarbon dates from the site of Xidatan 2 (approximate to 4300 m above sea level [asl] in the Kunlun Pass, northern Tibetan Plateau) suggest the site was intermittently and briefly occupied approximately 9200-6400 yr B.P. This age is substantially younger than expected given the late Upper Paleolithic character of the lithic assemblage, which is dominated by microlithic and unique discoidal prepared core technologies. Comparisons between Xidatan 2 and known surface lithic assemblages in the Kekexili and Chang Tang regions of the central high Plateau show not only that the latter are technologically similar to Xidatan 2, but also that they are demonstrably connected to Xidatan 2 through utilization of the same stone raw materials, which includes a chemically distinctive obsidian. Contrary to most accounts of Tibetan Plateau colonization, our results suggest that the earliest substantial occupations on the interior Tibetan Plateau above 4000 m asl may date to the Pleistocene/Holocene transition.

Shoreline Response to Rapid 20th Century Sea-Level Change along the Iranian Caspian Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, is characterized by rapid sea-level changes. This Provides a real physical model of coastal response to rapid sea-level change in a period of just a few years, which might take a millennium along oceanic coasts. Between 1929 and 1995, the Caspian sea level experienced the last cycle, with a range of +/- 3 m. This caused disastrous effects along the coast and destroyed many buildings, roads, farms, and other human property. During the preceding 48 years of sea-level fall, a large area of the sea bottom emerged, which was then used for the development of residential zones. That area had to be abandoned when sea level rose by almost 3 m in a period of 18 years. With the use of LANDSAT data, we calculated total shoreline shifts in 22 littoral cells, each cell containing three transects over a 3-km distance. Both landward and seaward shifts occur during rapid sea-level rise between 1977 and 2001.					; Kroonenberg, Salomon/GQI-4402-2022; Goorabi, Abolghasem/F-6820-2017	Kroonenberg, Salomon Bernard/0000-0001-7240-8425; Goorabi, Abolghasem/0000-0002-2787-8687													0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2014	30	6					1243	1250		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00173.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00173.1													WOS:000344828400013

In previous years both had experienced seasonal anoxia as a result of collapses of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae blooms followed by a massive fish kill. Additions altered the bloom magnitude and the species composition if N was added prior to the appearance of A. flos-aquae. Low additions (.apprx. 0.75-1.5 g m-3 per wk) initiated after the appearance of the cyanophyte bloom resulted in a significant reduction of the A. flos-aquae biomass, while the same addition at the time of a chlorophyte bloom (Scenedesmus and Oocystis sp.) caused a substantial shift to Microcystis aeruginosa. High additions (.apprx. 7-14 g m-3 per wk) resulted in a total absence of cyanophytes and were followed by a complete shift to small chlorophytes and cryptomonads, with a total absence of A. flos-aquae and the fish kill. Low additions of N did not show any accumulation over 3-5 mo. after discontinuation of the fertilization; high additions showed a significant accumulation of nitrate in the water.

Seasonal Survival of Adult Female Mottled Ducks	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The mottled duck (Anas fulgivula) is a non-migratory duck dependent on coastal habitats to meet all of its life cycle requirements in the Western Gulf Coast (WGC) of Texas and Louisiana, USA. This population of mottled ducks has experienced a moderate decline during the past 2 decades. Adult survival has been identified as an important factor influencing population demography. Previous work based on bandrecovery data has provided only annual estimates of survival. We assessed seasonal patterns of female mottled duck survival from 2009 to 2012 using individuals marked with satellite platform transmitter terminals (PTTs). We used temperature andmovement sensors within each PTT to indicate potential mortality events. We estimated cumulative weekly survival and ranked factors influential in patterns of mortality using knownfate modeling in Program MARK. Models included 4 predictors: week; hunting and non-hunting periods; biological periods defined as breeding, brooding, molt, and pairing; and mass at time of capture. Models containing hunt periods, during and outside the mottled duck season, comprised essentially 100% of model weights where both legal and illegal harvest had a negative influence on mottled duck survival. Survival rates were low during 2009-2011 (12-38% annual rate of survival), when compared with the long-term banding average of 53% annual survival. During 2011, survival of female mottled ducks was the lowest annual rate (12%) ever documented and coincided with extreme drought. Management actions maximizing the availability of wetlands and associated upland habitats during hunting seasons and drought conditions may increase adult female mottled duck survival.

Tracing bottom water oxygenation with sedimentary Mn/Fe ratios in Lake Zurich, Switzerland	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Redox dynamics of manganese (Mn) were studied in the sediment of Lake Zurich using precise sediment core age models, monthly long-term oxygen (O-2) monitoring data of the water column (1936-2010) and high-resolution XRF core scanning. The age models were based on bi-annual lamination and calcite precipitation cycles. If present, Mn exhibits distinct maxima, which coincide with the annual maximum deep-water O-2 concentrations in spring according to the monitoring data. In contrast, the iron (Fe) signal is mainly the result of calcite dilution, as indicated by a strong negative correlation between Fe and calcium (Ca) XRF data. The Mn/Fe ratio in the core from the maximum lake depth (ZH10-15, 137 m) revealed a moderate correlation with O-2 measurements in the lake bottom water confirming the successful application of the Mn/Fe ratio to semi-quantitatively reconstruct bottom water oxygenation in the lake. Mostly low ratios were observed between 1895 and the mid-1960s as a result of eutrophication. However, geochemical focusing and sedimentological factors can reduce the applicability of the Mn/Fe ratio in reconstructing O-2 concentrations in the bottom water of lakes. (C). 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jin, KR; Ji, ZG; Hamrick, JH				Jin, KR; Ji, ZG; Hamrick, JH			Modeling winter circulation in Lake Okeechobee, Florida	JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING												A time-dependent three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Okeechobee was validated and used to understand the physical processes associated with vertical mixing in the lake. The lake has relatively uniform water depths in the open water areas, and the localized bathymetry irregularities are small, which enables the Lake Okeechobee Hydrodynamic Model with a grid resolution of 912x923 m to represent the hydrodynamic processes reasonably well. This work presents the results of a 7-week simulation that uses measured bathymetry, relative humidity, total solar radiation, wind velocity, inflow, and outflow. Surface elevation, velocity field, and temperature are computed and compared with observed data. Conservation equations for mass, momentum, and temperature transport are solved to provide values for water depth, current velocities, and water temperatures. The statistical comparisons between the simulated and observed results indicate that the model represents the circulation and temperature distribution of the lake very well. The model was run for a 7-week verification period, during which water levels receded because of dry conditions. The model also indicates that well mixed circulation patterns for the top and bottom layers result from high wind events. Diurnal thermal stratification impacts may result in a two-layer flow and affect the horizontal dispersion in Lake Okeechobee. The model results indicate that wind is the major driving force of horizontal and vertical water movement; however, during calm periods, geostrophic currents would be significant.																			0733-950X	1943-5460				MAY-JUN	2002	128	3					114	125		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(2002)128:3(114)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(2002)128:3(114)													WOS:000175323100002
J	France, RL				France, RL			Empirically estimating the lateral transport of riparian leaf litter to lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. An experimental study found the lateral transport of riparian leaf litter to increase in relation to surface slope, exposure to precipitation, and absence of ground flora. Deciduous leaves displayed greater lateral redistribution than did coniferous needles. 2. When these results were combined with the proportional representation of different slopes, canopy exposures and ground roughness measured from transects throughout the riparian zones of sixteen north-western Ontario lakes, the average annual lateral transport distance of coniferous needles was estimated to be 0.3 m and that of deciduous leaves to be 0.5 m. 3. Data on the annual riparian litterfall and distributional proximity of trees to the shorelines suggested that the lateral input of riparian litter was 2 g m(-1) forested shoreline yr(-1), an amount which represents 6% of the total annual allochthonous input of leaf-fall to these study lakes.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0046-5070					DEC	1995	34	3					495	499		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00907.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00907.x													WOS:A1995TP03400009

Acidic South Lake had the lowest respiration rate at all seasons and the smallest net incorporation of the 35SO42-. Summer net isotope transformation into ester sulfate and non-HI reducible S (pyrite and C-bonded S) constituents was 88.6%, 89.4%, and 59.7% of total sediment isotope for Oneida, Dear, and South, respectively. Seasonal variation of net isotope incorporation was observed in each lake as were differences in 35SO42- partitioning into major S pools. Of the S constituents analyzed, HCl digestible S (volatile sulfides) was the smallest pool, while ester sulfate and non-HI reducible S together accounted for greater than 50% of S isotope transformation in all lakes. In addition, ester sulfate is the major product of dissolved SO42- transformation and its formation results in less alkalinity generation than the formation of non-HI reducible S constituents. Thus ester sulfate transformation processes must be considered in calculating alkalinity generation by lake sediments.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 8	1988	160	1					85	95		10.1007/BF00014281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014281													WOS:A1988M507200009
J	Laas, A; Noges, P; Koiv, T; Noges, T				Laas, Alo; Noges, Peeter; Koiv, Toomas; Noges, Tiina			High-frequency metabolism study in a large and shallow temperate lake reveals seasonal switching between net autotrophy and net heterotrophy	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Respiratory CO2 release from inland waters is a major process in the global carbon cycle, retaining more than half of the carbon flux from terrestrial sources that otherwise would reach the sea. The strongly lake type-specific balance between primary production and respiration determines whether a lake acts regionally as a net sink or source of CO2. This study presents two-year (2009, 2010) results of high-frequency metabolism measurements in the large and shallow polymictic eutrophic Lake Vrtsjarv (area 270 km(2); mean depth 2.8 m). We estimated the net ecosystem production (NEP), community respiration (R) and gross primary production (GPP) from continuous measurements of oxygen, irradiance, wind and water temperature. A sinusoidal model fitted to the calculated metabolic rates showed the prevalence of net autotrophy (mean GPP:R > 1) from early spring until August/September, whereas during the rest of the year heterotrophy (mean GPP:R < 1) prevailed, characterizing the lake as CO2 neutral on an annual basis. Community respiration lagged behind GPP by approximately 2 weeks, which could be explained by the bulk of the phytoplankton biomass accounted for by filamentous cyanobacteria that are considered mostly inedible to zooplankton, and the seasonally increasing role of sediment resuspension. In the warmer year 2010, the seasonal peaks of GPP, R and NEP were synchronously shifted nearly 1 month earlier compared with 2009. The strong stimulating effect of temperature on both GPP and R and its negative effect on NEP revealed by the multiple regression analysis suggests increasing metabolic rates and increasing heterotrophy in this lake type in a warmer climate.

A thick litter layer of plant material on the vegetation surface is consistent with the vegetation lacking evidence of disturbance. Plant macrofossils and graminoid cuticle analysis show the presence of a graminoid assemblage consistent with phytolith data. The pollen data indicate that trees were not local to the site and that Artemisia sp. was present in the region. The insect and bryophyte reconstructions are consistent with the vascular plant reconstruction, indicating the site was at least periodically wet. delta C-13 values from the graminoids present show a large range encompassing both the wet and dry range displayed by modern graminoids in Alaska. Sequential delta C-13 analyses conducted along the length of leaves attached to the vegetation surface indicate a seasonal shift towards relatively higher water use efficiency. The lower water use efficiency earlier in the growing season may have stemmed from the use of winter season meltwater by plants at the site - a scenario consistent with the site's cryostratigraphy. Our multi-proxy reconstruction contributes to the limited palaeoecological data available for graminoid-dominated vegetation present in Eastern Beringia and particularly the interior of Alaska during the mid-Wisconsinan interstadial.

The HFCW, planted with reeds (Phragmites communis) and irises (Iris tectorum Maxim), was operated for 227 days. The mean removal efficiency of NH4+-N was 36.7%, of total nitrogen (TN) 70.2%, of total phosphorus 75.3%, of permanganate index (CODMn) 35.8%, and of Chlorophyll a 70.0%. The effluent concentrations of these pollutants were all within the Grade III threshold of China's water quality standards for surface water. Correlation analysis showed that TN removal was related to the COD(Mn)concentration in the influent (r(2) = 0.65) and was closely related to the temperature (r(2) = 0.91). The HFCW had a water production efficiency of 98%-99% over the entire operational period, which suggests that it did not block easily. Results from 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing showed that Proteobacteria (40.65%) dominated at the phylum level. At the genus level, the relative abundance ofNitrosomonadaceae(3.57%) was highest in autumn and the spatial distribution from the front to the back varied slightly from 2.57% to 2.99%. Our results will help researchers to develop optimal designs for HFCW systems to treat slightly polluted water.

J	Grebneva, MP				Grebneva, Marina P.			FRAGRANCES OF LIFE AND DEATH IN THE WORKS ABOUT FLORENCE BY RUSSIAN AUTHORS	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY												The article examines the real and metaphoric flavors generated by Florence. In the most general form, they can be divided into two groups, those that relate to life and death. Aleksey Tolstoy, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Innokenty Annensky, Alexander Blok and Nikolay Gumilev knew the city of flowers well and created its image, which can not be imagined without the olfactory component, in their works. Tolstoy miraculously conveyed the spirit of Florence, the city of flowers, painting and love, in his letters, autobiography and especially in the poem "Portrait". The hero of the poem not only sees, touches, but also smells a fragrant flower or a faded one, which smells of wilting, and sees a beautiful flower girl, decorated with flowers, carrying flowers and emitting fragrance, a girl who descended from a picturesque canvas to the real world. The image of the heroine of the poem is associated with the scents of love, beauty, spring, miracle. Merezhkovsky believed that the fragrance of Florence is the "smell of damp dust, like that of irises", the smell of water, water dust, a moist smell, light and subtle, it falls into components and conditions its derivatives - the incense of fog, lake, river. It is present in the famous painting of Leonardo da Vinci, who perpetuated the Mona Lisa. The simple and natural smell of water joins the "barely perceptible fresh smell of lacquer and the colors of very old paintings", which emphasizes the contrast of the city of flowers, its special atmosphere of love, the beloved woman. Annensky was looking for his dream flower in Florence. It can be assumed that the symbol of the city of flowers - the lily - became such a flower. The smell of lilies is diabolical and divine, it is the focus of the hope for reciprocity and the impossibility of this reciprocity. The flowers smell of a new meeting and separation, a hope for life and the inevitability of death, they breathe fragrantly and poisonously, divinely and diabolically. The beauty of flowers and their smells cannot be separated or replaced with anything. Blok was looking for the smells of the Florence of the past in the present, in the contemporary reality. He is haunted by the cadaverous smell of roses, scorched by the fire of irises, smoke and burning, by the trading spirit that has replaced the smell of damp flowers. The trampled lilies he mentions probably emit the smell of wilting and death. Gumilev emphasized the simplicity, the artlessness of the scents of the city of flowers the smells of water, river, grass, and the artificial smells of "incense" that oppose them, as well as the smells of smoke and burning from the fires that devoured Savonarola and the painting by Leonardo. In the works of Tolstoy and Merezhkovsky, the smells of life prevail over the smells of death, in the poems of Annensky they balance on the verge of complementing each other, and in the sketches of Blok and Gumilev the scents of death dominate over the fragrances of life.

After about 6 centuries of quiescence, this eruption destroyed a large dome and opened a 1 km wide crater. A lake, formed within the crater shortly after the eruption, has been an important source of information about the evolution of the post-eruptive processes. The fluctuations of the crater lake water physicochemical parameters, observed since 1983, have allowed in identifying hydrothermal waters and H2S-rich gases, influenced by tectonic and meteorological effects, as the main contributors to its composition. Here we propose some methods to help in assessing the state of the volcano derived from the relative contribution of these factors as an easy to implement volcanic surveillance method in potentially active volcanoes with crater lakes, or other volcano-influenced water sources.

Previous studies of aquatic ecosystems revealed that zoosporic chytrid epidemics represent an important driving factor in phytoplankton seasonal successions. In this study, host-parasite dynamics in Lake Pavin (France) were investigated during the spring diatom bloom while following chytrid epidemics using next generation sequencing (NGS). Metabarcoding analyses were applied to study changes in the eukaryotic microbial community throughout diatom bloom-chytrid epidemics. Relative read abundances of metabarcoding data revealed potential "beneficiaries" and "victims" during the studied period. Subsequently, metatranscriptomic analyses on samples before and during the chytrid epidemic unveiled the active part of the community and functional/metabolic dynamics in association with the progress of chytrid infection. Diatom functions involving lipases, transporters, histones, vacuolar systems, the proteasome, proteases and DNA/RNA polymerases were more abundant during the diatom bloom. Chytrid functions related to a parasitic lifestyle including invasion, colonization and stress tolerance were up-regulated during the chytrid epidemic. In addition, functions related to the degradation/metabolism of proteins, lipids and chitin were in higher proportion in the community during the epidemic event. Results of NGS and bioinformatics analyses offered a panorama of dynamic biodiversity and biological functioning of the community.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	MONCHY, Sebastien/0000-0001-5808-4700; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				NOV	2022	31	21					5618	5634		10.1111/mec.16675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16675		SEP 2022						36028992					WOS:000850714200001

Cells of two strains under the 10 D treatment were enlarged relative to those under the 25 L treatment. This effect was very pronounced in that the length of enlarged cells was on average 130-140% of that of normal cells, and also reversible, as cells showed the opposite pattern within a week after switching treatments. In addition, many achromic drops were observed in cells cultured under the 10 D treatment. These drops are probably lipids produced by the photobiont, Chlorella variabilis.

Interactions between Hatch Dates, Growth Rates, and Mortality of Age-0 Native Rainbow Smelt and Nonnative Alewife in Lake Champlain	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Timing of hatch in fish populations can be critical for first-year survival and, therefore, year-class strength and subsequent species interactions. We compared hatch timing, growth rates, and subsequent mortality of age-0 Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax and Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, two common open-water fish species of northern North America. In our study site, Lake Champlain, Rainbow Smelt hatched (beginning May 26) almost a month earlier than Alewives (June 20). Abundance in the sampling area was highest in July for age-0 Rainbow Smelt and August for age-0 Alewives. Late-hatching individuals of both species grew faster than those hatching earlier (0.6 mm/d versus 0.4 for Rainbow Smelt; 0.7 mm/d versus 0.6 for Alewives). Mean mortality rate during the first 45 d of life was 3.4%/ d for age-0 Rainbow Smelt and was 5.5%/d for age-0 Alewives. Alewife mortality rates did not differ with hatch timing but daily mortality rates of Rainbow Smelt were highest for early-hatching fish. Cannibalism is probably the primary mortality source for age-0 Rainbow Smelt in this lake. Therefore, hatching earlier may not be advantageous because the overlap of adult and age-0 Rainbow Smelt is highest earlier in the season. However, Alewives, first documented in Lake Champlain in 2003, may increase the mortality of age-0 Rainbow Smelt in the summer, which should favor selection for earlier hatching.

The polyaluminium hydrochloride coagulant was applied repeatedly to a shallow eutrophic fishpond in spring 2005. Two cylindrical plastic enclosures were used to isolate parts of the pond as untreated controls. Selected environmental variables were measured in situ. Water samples were analyzed regularly for nutrients, chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton abundance and structure with special focus on Planktothrix agardhii. The PAX-18 treatment led to a marked increase in the N/P ratio and changes in the structure and abundance of phytoplankton in the fishpond and P. agardhii blooms were eliminated in the fishpond. By contrast, P agardhii dominated the phytoplankton in the control enclosures, as it bad in the fishpond in 2004, prior to the PAX-18 treatment.																			1802-5439					NOV	2008	8	2					147	154		10.5507/fot.2008.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5507/fot.2008.013													WOS:000259981800010

Of Canvasbacks present, 25-28% were female of which 17-27% were paired. Paired Canvasbacks spent more time in foraging aggression and initiated and won more encounters than did unpaired individuals. Paired females engaged in more courtship-related threats, chases, and neck-stretches than did unpaired females. Paired females exceeded paired males in foraging aggression and in courtship behaviors such as neck-stretches and chases, with the trend in all chases reversing just before or upon arrival at nesting sites. Thus in the early stages of pairing, females rather than males appeared to assume the primary role in foraging aggression and repelling courtship advances of other males.																				1938-5129				MAY	1990	92	2					369	378		10.2307/1368234	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1368234													WOS:A1990DF75200010

Calcium and sodium as regulators of the recovery of four Daphnia species along a gradient of metals and base cations in metal contaminated lakes in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Smelting of sulphur-rich metallic ores in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, has caused acidification and metal contamination of thousands of lakes in the region. Recent reductions in smelter emissions have resulted in much ecological recovery, but the recovery of Daphnia species has been poor. To determine if Cu and Ni toxicity could explain differences in daphniid recovery among lakes, we compared results of 14 d static with renewal bioassays in waters from Blue Chalk Lake, an uncontaminated reference lake 200 km from Sudbury, and from five Sudbury lakes ranging in distance from the smelters and varying in metal and cation concentrations. We spiked Blue Chalk Lake water with Cu and Ni to levels resembling those of the Sudbury lakes and also tested the lake waters for toxicity. Survival of Daphnia pulex, D. pulicaria and D. mendotae decreased monotonically with increasing metal concentrations in the spiked Blue Chalk Lake treatments, falling from 90% in the controls to 0% at the two highest Cu and Ni levels, reflecting levels of Middle and Hannah lakes. In contrast, survival in waters collected from the actual Sudbury lakes did not monotonically track their total metal concentrations. Rather, survival fell to 0% in Clearwater Lake water, a lake with intermediate metal contamination (8.9 and 79.9 mu g L-1 of Cu and Ni, respectively) vs 70-100% in the other lakes. We performed an additional assay with Clearwater Lake waters increasing its Ca and Na concentrations, singly and in combination to levels that reflected the levels in Middle Lake. The survival of the four daphniid species increased from 0% up to 80-100% with added Ca and from 0% to 60-90% with added Na. Lipid-ovarian indices had a similar trend to survival for D. mendotae and D. pulicaria in Bioassay 1, varying with the cation concentrations in the lakes for the daphniids in Bioassay 2. The bioassays results imply that regional recovery patterns of daphniids in Sudbury lakes cannot be understood without as a minimum considering both metal and base cation concentration differences among lakes, and give an indication of differences among Daphnia species to cope with metal stress.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75			2			36	49		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1271	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1271													WOS:000374772200008

Seasonal plasticity in photoprotection modulates UV-induced hsp gene expression in copepods from a clear lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Zooplankton from clear alpine lakes is exposed to stressful levels of solar UV radiation (UVR). As these pelagic organisms experience high UVR and large changes in solar radiation conditions between ice-free and ice-cover periods, they have evolved various strategies to minimize UVR exposure and damage. Here, we studied the relation between photoprotection levels (mycosporine-like amino adds, carotenoids), antioxidant capacities, and gene expression of heat shock proteins (hsps) as indicator of stress in the copepod Cyclops abyssorum tatricus during the course of a year. Expression of hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90 was measured in the field (baseline expression [BE]) and after UVR exposure in the laboratory. The BE differed among genes and seasons (hsp60: high during summer, hsp70 and hsp90: high during the ice-cover period). The gene expression of hsp70 was upregulated after exposure to UVR (up to 5.2-fold change), while hsp60 and hsp90 were only constitutively expressed. A strong seasonal pattern was found in the photoprotective compounds and antioxidant capacities, with highest levels during the ice-free period. The extent of upregulation of hsp70 gene expression increased with decreasing photoprotection levels and peaked 24 h post UVR exposure (9.6-fold change) at the time of lowest photoprotection (February). Our data suggest that hsp70 gene expression is modulated by seasonal plasticity in photoprotection. This ability of adequate stress response is essential for survival in highly variable ecosystems such as alpine lakes.

Children's Blood Lead Seasonality in Flint, Michigan (USA), and Soil-Sourced Lead Hazard Risks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												In Flint; MI; USA; a public health crisis resulted from the switching of the water supply from Lake Huron to a more corrosive source from the Flint River in April 2014; which caused lead to leach from water lines. Between 2010 and 2015; Flint area children's average blood lead patterns display consistent peaks in the third quarter of the year. The third quarter blood lead peaks displayed a declining trend between 2010 and 2013; then rose abruptly between the third quarters of 2013 from 3.6% blood lead levels >= 5 mu g/dL to a peak of about 7% in the third quarter of 2014; an increase of approximately 50%. The percentage of blood lead level >= 5 mu g/dL in the first quarter of 2015 then dropped to 2.3%; which was the same percentage as the first quarter of 2014 (prior to the Flint River water source change). The Flint quarterly blood lead level peak then rose to about 6% blood lead levels >= 5 mu g/dL in the third quarter of 2015; and then declined to about 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Soil lead data collected by Edible Flint food collaborative reveal generally higher soil lead values in the metropolitan center for Flint; with lower values in the outskirts of the city. The questions that are not being asked is why did children's blood lead levels display a seasonal blood lead pattern before the introduction of the new water supply in Flint; and what are the implications of these seasonal blood lead patterns? Based upon previous findings in Detroit and other North American cities we infer that resuspension to the air of lead in the form of dust from lead contaminated soils in Flint appears to be a persistent contribution to lead exposure of Flint children even before the change in the water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River.

J	PROPHET, CW				PROPHET, CW			ZOOPLANKTON CHANGES IN A KANSAS LAKE 1963-1981	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The limnetic microcrustacean fauna of Lake Reading, located near Emporia, Kansas, now consists of 11 spp. of copepods and 18 spp. of cladocerans, with the Copepoda usually constituting at least 70% of the adult and immature individuals observed in samples. The average annual standing crops from April 1979-Aug. 1981 ranged from 11.1-18.6 individuals/l for the copepods compared to 5.4 - 7.7 cladocerans/l. Leptodora kindti and Daphnia galeata mendotae have become established in the lake since 1975, and the abundance of Bosmina longirostris has declined markedly since the appearance of L. kindti. Trial stocking of the threadfin shad by Kansas Fish and Game fisheries biologists during the last 2 yr of this study was accompanied by severe reductions in zooplankton abundance by late summer.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1982	1	6					569	575		10.1080/02705060.1982.9664078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1982.9664078													WOS:A1982PT75500003

The AMS C-14 dating technique, geochemical, mineral magnetic, micro- and macrofossil analyses were applied to sediments recovered from lake Stevatnet and the results are interpreted in terms of palaeoenvironmental conditions between 9800 and 8300 C-14 BP. After the disappearance of local glaciers before ca 9800 C-14 BP, the lake productivity increased rapidly at the same time as pioneer plant communities developed on soils which gradually became more stable. Insect data indicates that strong seasonal contrasts with mean July temperatures around 9 degrees C and mean January temperatures around -12 degrees C prevailed between 9500 and 8300 C-14 BP. These high summer temperatures, possibly as much as 4-5 degrees C higher than the present, favoured the development of a flora including Dryas and Angelica cf. archangelica. The enhanced freeze/thaw processes led to an increased erosion of minerogenic and organic material. After 8000 C-14 BP the temperatures may have gradually declined. The environmental reconstruction derived from our data set supports the conceptual insolation model which proposes maximum Holocene seasonality for the Northern Hemisphere at ca 9000 C-14 BP.

Their occurrence in tropical lakes has rarely been investigated. In this study, the predominance and diversity of Vibrio spp. was investigated over a 12-month period in a coastal lagoon, Songkhla Lake, in southern Thailand. Water samples were collected at 2 stations in the estuary near Yor Island in Songkhla Lake. The predominant vibrios were detected by a culture-based method, using thiosulfate citrate bile salt sucrose agar and CHROMagar Vibrio. The diversity of Vibrio spp. was evaluated using denaturant density gradient electrophoresis (DGGE). The highest numbers of total vibrios and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in both areas were observed during the summer. There was no significant correlation between the numbers of vibrios, including V parahaemolyticus, and either the water temperature or plankton density. Variations in Vibrio species were observed with changes in salinity. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 were detected during the rainy season when the salinity dropped to nearly 0 parts per thousand. In both areas, V. alginolyticus was the most prominent species detected by the culture method, whereas Vibrio parahaemolyticus was detected by DOGE, every month. Other Vibrio spp. of potential public health concern were also detected by the culture method; they included V. vulnificus, V fluvialis, and V. mimicus.

J	Celico, P; Summa, G				Celico, P; Summa, G			Occurrence and development of groundwater in the Vulture Volcano (Basilicata)	BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA												Occurrence and development of groundwater in the Vulture Volcano (Basilicata).The groundwaters of the Vulture volcanic area are widely known in Italy because they,- are bottled and commercialised as effervescent mineral waters. In this area many hydrogeological studies have been carried out, generally analysing particular aspects of the groundwater flow on a local scale only (CASORIA, 1901; MONGELLI, 1964; REINA, 1969; CIET TAZIOLI, 1981; FIDELIBUS et alii, 1981; FUGANTl et alii, 1941). Instead systematic studies on the whole hydrogeological structure have only been recently carried out. Therefore in the hydrogeological knowledge of the Vulture there was a lack of an overall systematic scheme for groundwater flow, which could be useful for hydrogeological analysis applied to the assessment and projection of the groundwater resources. In this sense, the present paper can be considered the first contribution to a certainly complex and articulated knowledge development. Mount Vulture is a Pleistocene stratovolcano, located in the northeastern sector of the Basilicata region, along the external edge of the Apennine Chain, close to the Bradano river Miocene foredeep. Mount Vulture's volcanic structure developed during the Period 730 and 130 kyr BP (BROCCHINI et alii, 1994), with a period of maximum activity from 800 kyr to 580 kyr, BP (BOENZI et alii, 1987. Mount Vulture is different from the other volcanoes belonging to the Co-Magmatic Roman Province. In fact, it is the only one to be located along the eastern flank of the Apennine Chain, to have the hauyne as the dominant feldspathoid in the place of the leucite and to have lavas with a K2O/Na2O rate close to the HKS magma series. Moreover, the strontium isotopic composition is the lowest; known among the potassic volcanic rocks of the continental pan of Southern Italy (LA VOLPE & PRINCIPE, 1989a), besides remaining stable during the evolution of the volcano (Sr-87/Sr-86: 0,70563-626). The evolutional history of Mount Vulture can be outlined in three principal phases (BOENZI et alii, 198). The hydrogeological data have been specifically suryeved through quantitative and qualitative monitoring carried out in a period between August and September 1999, which consisted of: a piezometric levels survey in more than 90 wells; the control of more than 40 springs; the interpretation of aquifer tests executed in 16 wells, the analysis and interpretation of stratigraphy of the same wells; the measure of stream discharge in 26 Stream sections, the estimation of the mean hydrological budget (1964-1994); the determination of the principal chemical and physical parameters in 65 water points. Results of hydrogeological surveys in the volcanic area of Mount Vulture, mainly carried out in the period August-September 1999, in combination with regional and local structural data, have allowed the deepening of the knowledge about general groundwater circulation. Two hydrogeologically independent groundwater basins have been found Monticchio-Atella and Melfi-Barile. The Monticchio-Atella basin is confined between the most important faults of the volcano (Grigi valley-Corbo creek and Southern fault): the central part is the recharge area: the preferential outflow destinations (springs and stream channels) are located eastward in the Atella zone and westward in the Monticchio zone; the groundwater flow pattern is complicated by the presence of lakes; the dominant hydrogeochemical type is the sodium-bicarbonate; in the Monticchio area the acquifer has a relatively moderate transmissivity value (5divided by5x10(-3) m(2)/s), instead in the Atella area the highest transmissivity values have been estimated. In the Atella area (1divided by5x10(-3) m(2)/s) is located the most important spring of the volcanic structure ("La Francesca"), whose discharge has been decreasing over the years owing to the construction of many groundwater exploitation wells. In the Monticchio-Atella groundwater basin the representative hydrogeochemical type is sodium-bicarbonate, associated with high grade mineralization of groundwater. The latter is characterised by relative abundance of CO2 (with values up to about 4000 mg/l), by electrical conductivity ranging between 200 and 19.000 muS/cm and by temperatures ranging between 10degreesC and about 20degreesC. The highest CO2 values have been detected in the Monticchio area, where the last eruption of Monte Vulture occurred. In the Melfi-Barile basin different hydrogeochemical characteristics have been found. The water table morphology, besides representing alternating groundwater divides and preferential drainage axes, shows an approximate adaptation to topographic morphology. The preferential outflows are represented not only by springs but also by stream channels: Melfia creek (in the northern part) and the Arcidiaconata creek (in the eastern part). The acquifer transmissivity value is relatively average (5divided by10x10(-3) m(2)/s) in the western sector (Melfi area) and in the eastern sector it is the lowest of the whole volcanic structure (1divided by5x10(-3) m(2)/s) (Barile area). The groundwater in this basin is characterised by a temperature lower than 20degreesC, by insignificant CO2 concentrations and by an electrical conductivity lower than 500 muS/cm. Only one spring located near Toppo San Paolo, is not included in this, because it has a strong ascending CO2 flux (similar to274 mg/l) through deep tectonic structures, which controlled the formation of the crypto-dome of the same name. Calcium-bicarbonate and sodium-bicarbonate are the most represented hydrogeochemical types. The first, characterises a great part of Melfi-Barile groundwater basin, while the second can be detected only close to the aforesaid Toppo San Paolo structure (between Melfi and Rapolla towns) and in the area westward from Melfi. The assessment of the groundwater yield of Mount Vulture has been carried out, estimating the recharge by the actual infiltration and the groundwater outflows towards the stream channels and the springs. The hydrologic estimations have been carried out for the two basins (fig. 4): considering a reference surface of about 42,1 km(2) (except for the surface of the Monticchio lakes), for the Monticchio-Atella basin, and on a surface of about 33,4 km(2) for the Melfi-Barile basin. From the calculations a mean actual infiltration volume of about 9,85x10(-6) m(3)/year has been estimated, for the Monticchio-Atella basin, and of about 8,70x10(-6) m(3)/year for the Melfi-Barile basin (respectively equivalent to a mean annual discharge of about 312,3x10(-3) m(3)/s and of 275,9x10(-3) m(3)/s). The groundwater outflows resulted according to the recharge volumes. The validity of the calculations is indirectly confirmed by the mean specific yield of the hydrogeological structure estimated at about 8x10(-3) m(3)/s per km(2) and therefore, compatible with that indicated for other volcanic systems (CELICO et alii, 1988; 1999). Regarding the southern sector of the volcanic structure (southward from the southern fault), in contact with conglomerate-sandy-clayey deposits, the groundwater circulation was found to be relatively low. In fact, the few wells drilled in the area, reached the sedimentary impervious substrate at shallow depths, thus these wells are sterile or almost unproductive; moreover groundwater head values cannot be correlated to those of the adjacent Monticchio-Atella basin and the discharge measurements in the Fiumara of the Atella river bed, in contrast to all other stream channels, do not show any increase of discharge.					; Summa, Gianpietro/JUV-4996-2023	Summa, Gianpietro/0009-0005-3878-7106; 													0037-8763						2004	123	3					343	356																WOS:000226631700003

Although Odonata are widely used as ecological indicators of freshwater habitat integrity and health, our understanding and knowledge of their ecological requirements in urban landscapes is not yet complete. Therefore, the taxonomic and functional diversity of Odonata assemblages was analyzed in a semi-natural wetland in the Croatian capital in the summers of 2020 and 2023. The two main habitat types, anthropogenically disturbed and natural oxbow lakes, mostly had comparable assemblage metrics. However, we found significant differences in relation to the time scale, where most metrics were lower in 2023, indicating the negative impact of extreme climate events (including droughts) that occurred in this region after 2020. As even some species of conservation concern were detected, our results indicate that semi-natural urban wetlands, especially natural oxbow lakes, have great potential to function as good habitats for Odonata.Abstract As the human population in urban areas is continuously growing, urbanization is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. To mitigate the negative effects, the inclusion of blue zones (aquatic habitats) in modern urban development practices is strongly recommended, as they could be beneficial for the local biodiversity conservation. Odonata are a flagship group and are widely used in freshwater conservation as ecological indicators of habitat integrity and health. However, our understanding of their ecological requirements in urban landscapes is not yet complete. Therefore, we analyzed the taxonomic and functional diversity of Odonata in a semi-natural wetland in the Croatian capital. This study was conducted in the summers of 2020 and 2023. Most taxonomic and functional assemblage metrics were comparable between the two main habitat types, anthropogenically disturbed and natural oxbow lakes. However, significant differences were found in relation to the time scale, where most metrics were lower in 2023, indicating the negative impact of extreme climate events (including droughts) that occurred in this region after 2020. With 19 species recorded, our results indicate that semi-natural urban wetlands, especially natural oxbow lakes, have great potential to function as good habitats for Odonata, where even some species of conservation concern were detected. When developing landscape management plans in urban areas, it is essential to consider the importance of habitat heterogeneity in terms of good structure of aquatic macrophytes (presence of submerged, emergent and floating vegetation), which would ensure the most suitable habitat conditions for local Odonata species.					; Vilenica, Marina/L-2927-2019; Koren, Toni/ABI-1774-2020; Gottstein, Sanja/K-3822-2014	Brigic, Andreja/0000-0002-1012-7166; 														2075-4450				MAR	2024	15	3							207	10.3390/insects15030207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects15030207								38535402					WOS:001192707200001
J	Jacks, G				Jacks, Gunnar			Drainage in Sweden -the past and new developments	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Land drainage in Sweden has been regulated in various laws since the Middle Ages. The lowering of lake surfaces and the ditching of wetlands has been considered a valuable task to gain cultivable land, and more recently, to promote forest growth. However, in recent years the debate surrounding drainage in forests has been a matter of considerable discussion. The dry and hot summer of 2018 has awakened new views on the subject. Monitoring has shown an exceptionally low groundwater levels countrywide. Especially the islands of oland and Gotland have faced groundwater shortages and the groundwater levels are still low in both small and large aquifers. Drainage within forest land has lacked any scientific basis until rather recently. Still, it has been a supported activity during the twentieth century. However, this has gradually as knowledge on the activity has increased and the ecology of downstream water bodies has been considered. Today, only the rinsing of existing drainage is actively practised, and it is surrounded by a number of recommendations which are still under discussion.																			0906-4710	1651-1913				JUL 4	2019	69	5					405	410		10.1080/09064710.2019.1586991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2019.1586991													WOS:000474807700004

Dynamic rates of Freshwater Drum near the northern extent of their range: evidence of environment-recruitment relationships	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Estimation of population dynamic rates is one of the most established and widely recognized components of modern fisheries management, yet this information is rarely collected for non-threatened native species. Pejorative views of native, underrepresented fish have contributed to a dearth of research and management efforts for these species. We sought to reduce this knowledge gap for one of the most widely distributed freshwater fish in North America, Freshwater Drum Aplodinotus grunniens (Rafinesque, 1819). We calculated estimates of growth, mortality, and recruitment from lotic environments in the most northern drainage of their range (i.e., Hudson Bay). Our estimates of growth (K, Brody growth coefficient) are similar to studies as far south as Alabama, USA. Estimates of annual mortality (4-10%) and longevity (62 years) are consistent with latitudinal trends observed in the standing literature. We found evidence of recruitment variability (recruitment variability index = 0.53), with a positive association between growing season degree days and year-class strength. Hydrologic variables of discharge during the cold season and rise rate were found to have negative relationships to recruitment. This research gives insight into factors regulating Freshwater Drum populations and will provide useful information for the management and conservation of this widespread but underappreciated species.					; Pegg, Mark/AAG-4197-2021	Pegg, Mark/0000-0002-8235-1327; Stuart, Marshall, William/0009-0003-3159-8455; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2024	107	12			SI		1691	1708		10.1007/s10641-024-01589-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-024-01589-0		SEP 2024											WOS:001304407200001

Initial Distribution and Interannual Decrease of Suspended Sediment in a Two-Basin Lake Following a Massive Mine Tailings Spill: Quesnel Lake, BC, Canada	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												On 4 August 2014, a tailings dam failure at Mount Polley Mine in central British Columbia led to the largest short-term release of mine waste into a lake ever recorded. Once released by the breach, slurry entered the smaller of Quesnel Lake's two basins, called the West Basin, from which the lake drains northwest into the Quesnel River. An estimated 38,000 +/- 11,000 tonnes of fine solids remained suspended in the West Basin on 10 September 2014, 37 days postspill. This decreased to within background levels (<300 tonnes) by June 2015, by which time similar to 4,000 tonnes of sediment had flowed from the West Basin into the Quesnel River, and similar to 31,000 tonnes had been transported east into the main basin, the direction opposed to the mean hydraulic gradient. Here, we evaluate sediment transport in Quesnel Lake following the Mount Polley tailings dam spill. We apply conservation of mass in two ways: using data collected between 12 August 2014 and 15 October 2020 to estimate suspended sediment mass and mass flows into and out of the West Basin; and using one- and two-basin completely mixed models. Suspended sediment concentrations were highly elevated through the first three seasons postspill, then fluctuated within a gradually decreasing, seasonal cycle. The observed mass trend and an analytical mass balance model of a simplified, two-basin system suggest that suspended sediment mass will fall to below the median prespill mass by 7 +/- 5 years postspill.

During recent years it has shown serious deterioration of water quality, especially in summer, Thermocline destruction is prohibited to maintain desirable temperature downstream of the reservoir for paddy field irrigation; thus, most of the existing control devices cannot be applied to the reservoir. Algal blooms in the reservoir, two vertical curtains, having depths to cover the epilimnion thickness, were installed across the reservoir to curtail the nutrient supply from the nutrient-rich inflow to the downstream epilimnion of the reservoir. Withdrawal level was also regulated to keep the downstream epilimnion off the nutrient supply. The results of this study illustrate the consequences of curtains on algal blooms in the reservoir. This method can mostly be applied for a reservoir or lake having an elongated shape.

The specific growth rate (SGR), growth model, and length frequency distribution at each age were calculated in relation to shell length. The growth rate of bivalves was high from June to September, when the water temperature was over 15 degrees C. Because of the seasonal growth pattern, the von Bertalanffy growth model extended with a periodic function was determined as the best model when our data in the field-caging experiment were applied to several growth models. It was found that the growth of C. japonica in Lake Abashiri is markedly slower than that in other fishing grounds in Honshu during the initial stage to age 2, and is accelerated in summer when aged 2.3. In Lake Abashiri, fast-growing individuals reach commercial size (>= 23.3 mm in shell length) at age 4, whereas most individuals take 5 or 6 years to grow to that size.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2021	87	2					132	143		10.2331/suisan.20-00007	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.20-00007													WOS:000626777400008

This seasonal reproduction is critically regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals. However, the molecular mechanisms that process environmental oscillations to initiate the seasonal mating are largely unknown.ResultsA transcriptomic analysis was conducted on the brain and gonad of male and female G. przewalskii in reproductive and nonreproductive seasons. We obtained 2034, 760, 1158 and 17,856 differentially expressed genes between the reproductively active and dormant female brain, male brain, ovary and testis. Among these genes, DIO2 was upregulated in the reproductively active brain and gonad of both males and females. Neuroactive ligand-receptor genes were activated in male and female brain. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that retinol metabolism was uniquely stimulated in reproductively active males. Genes involved in GnRH signaling and sex hormone synthesis exhibited higher expression levels in brain and gonad during the reproductive season. A co-expression network classified all the genes into 9 modules. The network pinpointed CDC42 as the hub gene that connected the pathways in responsible for modulating reproduction in G. przewalskii. Meanwhile, the sex pheromone receptor gene prostaglandin receptor was identified to link to multiple endocrine receptors, such as GnRHR2 in the network.ConclusionsThe current study profiled transcriptomic variations between reproductively active and dormant fish, highlighting the potential regulatory mechanisms of seasonal reproduction in G. przewalskii. Our data suggested that the seasonal regulation of reproduction in G. przewalskii was controlled by the external stimulation of photoperiodic variations. The activated transcription of neuroendocrine and sex hormone synthesis genes contributed to seasonal reproduction regulation in G. przewalskii, which was presumably influenced by the increased day-length during the breeding season.

The mortality of AAP bacteria was estimated from diel changes of BChl a fluorescence. Net and gross growth rates were calculated from the increases in AAP cell numbers. The gross growth rates of AAP bacteria ranged from 0.38 to 5.6 d(-1), with the highest values observed during summer months. Simultaneously, the rapidly growing AAP cells have to cope with an intense grazing pressure by both zooplankton and protists. The presented results document that during the day, gross growth usually surpased mortality. Our results indicate that AAP bacteria utilize light energy under natural conditions to maintain rapid growth rates, which are balanced by a generally intense grazing pressure.

J	Cloutis, EA; Hudon, P; Hiroi, T; Gaffey, MJ; Mann, P				Cloutis, E. A.; Hudon, P.; Hiroi, T.; Gaffey, M. J.; Mann, P.			Spectral reflectance properties of carbonaceous chondrites: 8. "Other" carbonaceous chondrites: CH, ungrouped, polymict, xenolithic inclusions, and R chondrites	ICARUS												We have analyzed reflectance spectra (0.3-2.5 mu m) of a number of ungrouped or tentatively grouped carbonaceous chondrites (CCs), possible CC-type xenoliths in an aubrite (Cumberland Falls) and a howardite (PRA 04401), a CH chondrite (PCA 91467), a CC polymict breccia (Kaidun), and some R chondrites. The best approach to analysis relies largely on characterizing spectrally active phases - i.e., those phases that contribute diagnostic absorption features, involving absorption band wavelength position, band depth, shape of absorption features, combined with albedo and spectral slope. Mafic silicate (hydrous and/or anhydrous) absorption features are ubiquitous in the CCs and R chondrites we have examined. Combining information on these features along with albedo and spectral slopes allows reasonable inferences to be made concerning their uniqueness. Reflectance spectra of Coolidge show contributions from both olivine and Fe oxyhydroxides (from terrestrial weathering), and its high reflectance and mafic silicate band depths are consistent with a petrologic grade >3 and inconsistent with CVs. The CC nature of the Cumberland Falls inclusions from spectral analysis is inconclusive, but they do exhibit spectral features consistent with their overall mineralogy. DaG 430, which has petrologic characteristics of both CV and CK chondrites, has a spectrum that is not fully consistent with either group. The spectrum of EET 96029 is consistent with some, but not all CM2 chondrites. GRO 95566, a meteorite with some affinities to CM2s, most resembles the Renazzo CR2 chondrite, consistent with their similar mineralogies, and its spectral properties can be related to its major mineralogic characteristics. Spectra of Kaidun are most consistent with CR chondrites, which form the bulk of this meteorite. The reflectance spectrum of MCY 92005 is consistent with its recent classification as a CM2 chondrite. The R3 chondrite MET 01149 shares many characteristics with CKs, but differs in terms of its slightly red slope and 2 mu m region absorption feature. The combination of high reflectance, deep 1 mu m band and, to a lesser extent, slightly red slope and weak 2 mu m region absorption band, distinguishes PRE 95404 from CV3s, to which it was initially assigned. The LAP 04840 R6 spectrum is dominated by olivine, consistent with a petrologic grade >3. Its reflectance is somewhat lower than for the R3 chondrites, and falls within the range of many CCs. Its most characteristic feature is the metal-OH absorption bands in the 2.3 mu m region. Analysis and assignment of PCA 91467 (CH3) is complicated by the presence of terrestrial weathering products. Its red spectral slope is consistent with its high metal content. Reflectance spectra of the howardite PRA 04401, which contains similar to 40% CM2-like inclusions, is dominated by the howardite's pyroxene absorption bands, and expected CM2-type absorption bands near 0.7 and 1.1 mu m are not seen. The CC xenoliths do reduce overall reflectance and pyroxene absorption band depths significantly, and probably add an overall red slope, when compared to inclusion-free howardites. QUE 99038, which has been linked to CM2, CO, or CR chondrites is not spectrally consistent with any of these groups. The 2 mu m band, high overall reflectance, and dominant olivine absorption band are all generally inconsistent with CM2 and CR2-3 chondrites. It resembles the CO3 chondrite ALH 77003 in the 1 mu m region, but differs in the 2 mu m region. The red-sloped, nearly featureless spectrum of Tagish Lake is unique among carbonaceous chondrites. It probably arises from the highly aromatic nature of the organic component and its intimate association with the phyllosilicate-rich matrix, which makes up a high proportion of this meteorite. Our results suggest that the meteorites included in this study can usually be determined to be either unique or to be placed with a reasonable degree of confidence into established CC groups. Our analysis has also provided insights into the degree to which spectral analysis can be used for characterization, the spectral features that can be used for characterization, and their limitations.

THE QUALITY OF WATER OF THE MANTOVO RESERVOIR (REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA)	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The aim of the paper is to evaluate the quality of water of the Mantovo Reservoir (Southeast Macedonia) based on physico-chemical parameters and the macrozoobenthos. Monthly sampling was performed during 2003 and 2004. Temperature and DO depth profile data indicate that the Mantovo Reservoir is a dimictic lake. Based on mean nutrient concentrations, the Mantovo Reservoir can be considered as being phosphorus-deficient. During the summer stratification, very high concentrations of Mn (2,819 mu g/l) and Cu (147.6 mu g/l) were detected in the lower profundal. Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was the dominant species, which indicates the presence of organic pollution. Dominance of Chaoborus crystallinus and decline in abundance of L. hoffmeisteri in the lower profundal indicate a deterioration of environmental status in the deepest part of the lake.

The variation in abundance of this molecule allows us reconstructing the history of millet cultivation around Lake Le Bourget. Our results support the introduction of millet around -1700 BC in the region. After an intensive cultivation during the Late Bronze Age, the failure of millet cropping during the Hallstatt period coincides with a phase of climatic deterioration. Millet cultivation recovers during the Roman and Mediaeval periods before falling most probably due to the introduction of more productive cereals. These pioneering results constitute the first continuous record of an agrarian activity covering the last 6000 years and emphasize the close relationships between local hydrology, land use and agro-pastoral activities around Lake Le Bourget.

Over the 24-year period of data collection, there has been a regional-scale decline in the relative abundance of walleye (Sander vitreus) and an increase in the relative abundance of bass (Micropterus spp.) species. These changes were associated with reductions in phosphorus concentration and increases in water clarity and summer temperature. Results of a comparative field study conducted on 13 regional lakes indicate significant positive associations between concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a and zooplankton and walleye density. These data suggest that bottom-up effects are limiting walleye abundance either directly or in combination with abiotic conditions that favour bass over walleye.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2006	63	4					798	809		10.1139/F05-259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-259													WOS:000237201300008

Here we report results from the study of pinnoite deposit from DaQaidam saline lake, indicating that pinnoite minerals are primary in origin. Within the detecting limit of X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD) analysis, no other borate minerals than pinnoite are detected from the Mg-borate deposit. The cemented pinnoite orebody shows the sedimentary structure of light-dark lamination couplets, which signal marked seasonal variations in brine chemistry. The scanning electronic microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX) examination reveals that all pinnoite minerals displayed euhedral, giving no indication of diagenetic origin. A marked shift in lithology from clastic sediment to evaporitic deposit reflects a critical change in sedimentation regime associated with abrupt changes in hydroclimatic conditions. The deposition of the pinnoite ore-layer containing abundant hydromagnesite marked the beginning of the evaporite formation and the end of the clastic deposition. This suggests that aridification occurred abruptly and the saline lake was much more alkaline than today in the early-stage of the evaporite deposition. The intensified summer evaporation and seasonal variations in water chemistry brought about a shallow to nearly desiccated paleo-lake with pH exceeding 9.3, Mg/Ca ratio >39, and boron concentration >600 mg/L, which favored pinnoite precipitation and the formation of pinnoite deposit in the central DaQaidam saline lake.

The implemented methods include Seismic Refraction (SRFR), Transient Electromagnetic Method (TEM), Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT), and Ground Penetration Radar (GPR). The combination of these methods allows the delineation of the salt layer boundaries, estimating its porosity distribution, finding cavities within the salt layer, and identifying deformations in the overlying sediments. This approach is shown to be useful for anticipating the occurrence of specific sinkholes, as demonstrated on both shores of the Dead Sea. These sinkholes are observed mainly along the edge of a salt layer deposited during the latest Pleistocene, when Lake Lisan receded to later become the Dead Sea. This salt layer is dissolved by aggressive water flowing from adjacent and underlying aquifers which drain to the Dead Sea. Sinkhole formation is accelerating today due to the rapid fall of the Dead Sea levels during the last 30 years, caused by anthropogenic use of its water. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple lithological, palaeontological and geochemical proxies and 32 radiocarbon dates from the 26-m-long core FA-1 provide a time series of the lake's transformation. Our results confirm that a permanent lake appeared in the Holocene at c.10cal. ka BP. The finely laminated lake sediments consist of diatomite, in which diatoms and ostracods together with lower concentrations of ions indicate a freshwater environment at the end of the early and middle Holocene. This freshwater supply was closely associated with regular inflows of the Nile water during flood seasons, when the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrated northwards in Africa, although it has probably never reached the Faiyum Oasis. Local rainfall, possibly connected with a northern atmospheric circulation, may have been important during winter. Several phases in the lake's evolution are recognized, represented by oscillations between deep open freshwater conditions during more humid climate and shallow fresh to brackish water during drier episodes. After a long freshwater phase, the lake setting has become more brackish since c.6.2cal. ka BP as indicated by diatoms and increasing contents of evaporite ions in the sediment. This clearly shows that since that time the lake has occasionally become partly desiccated. This is a result of reduced discharge of the Nile. In the late Holocene the lake was mostly brackish and then gradually turned into a saline lake. This natural process was interrupted about 2.3cal. ka BP when a man-made canal facilitated water inflow from the Nile. The examined FA-1 core can be used as a reference age model of climate change in the Holocene and its impact on the development and decline of ancient civilizations in northeastern Africa.

The investigations of plankton analysis were carried out in Lake Muggelsee (Grosser Muggelsee, Berlin), a eutrophic, polymictic shallow lake with an area of 7.2 km2, a mean depth of 4.9 M. The lake was described as a species rich water with partially considerable developments of diatoms and blue-green algae as was shown by plankton analyses from the beginning of this century. Since the end of the 60s, when macrophytes disappeared, Lake Muggelsee has been recognized as a lake with extensive phytoplankton development characterized by dense and irregular development of blue green algae and diatoms. Especially solitary centric diatoms increased in number and in biovolume from 1979 to 1990 and occurred with greater diameters in spring during the seasonal course. The specific content of chlorophyll a was estimated according to the algal composition. It is suggested that the observed decrease in Chl a per unit biovolume is associated with species size rather than the time of development depending on the unknown portion of inactive algal cells resuspended from the sediment surface.																			0020-9309						1993	78	3					359	377		10.1002/iroh.19930780306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780306													WOS:A1993MB33000004

Ontogenetic habitat use and seasonal activity of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in the Lake Albert delta, East Africa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Crocodiles play important roles in many ecosystems, but their populations worldwide are threatened by human exploitation and habitat destruction. We studied ontogenetic changes in habitat use and seasonal activity patterns in a population of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) inhabiting the Lake Albert Delta Wetland System, a Ramsar Site of international importance in Murchison Falls National Park of western Uganda. A total of 186 crocodile observations were made from monthly surveys of five transects during October 2017 to September 2018. Crocodiles exhibited a marginally bi-modal seasonal pattern, with the fewest observations from July to August and October to November, and the highest observations from January to February and April to May. Crocodiles were most frequently encountered along the north shore of the delta, especially on riverbanks with woody vegetation, followed by Cyperus papyrus-Vossia dominated habitats, while crocodiles were infrequently observed on islands and muddy banks. Habitat niche breadth was narrowest in hatchlings and widest in sub-adults, with juveniles and large adults exhibiting intermediate values. Overlap in habitat resource use across size classes was generally high, with the lowest overlap between hatchlings and juveniles, and the highest between large and sub-adult crocodiles. Our study on Nile crocodiles in the Lake Albert delta provides insights into habitat partitioning among different demographic segments of this population that can be utilized to improve its management in one of Africa's Great Lakes by spatially and temporally focusing conservation efforts on the most used habitats and seasonal aggregations, respectively.

Nearly all waters were supersaturated with respect to atmospheric pressures Of CO2 and CH4. Gas fluxes to the atmosphere ranged from -6.5 to 59.8 mmol m-2 d-1 for CO2 and from 0. 08 to 1.02 mmol m-2 d-1 for CH4, and were uncorrelated with latitude or lake morphology. Seasonal trends include a buildup Of CO2 and CH4 under ice during winter, and often an increased CO2 flux rate in August due to partial lake turnover. Nutrient fertilization experiments resulted in decreased CO2 release from a lake due to photosynthetic uptake, but no change in CO2 release from a river due to the much faster water renewal time. In lakes and rivers the groundwater input of dissolved CO2 and CH4 is supplemented by in-lake respiration of dissolved and particulate carbon washed in from land. The release of carbon from aquatic systems to the atmosphere averaged 24 g C m-2 y-1, and in coastal areas where up to 50% of the surface area is water, this loss equals 1/5 to 1/2 of the net carbon accumulation rates estimated for tundra.

The results of surface water analyses hardly showed any differences. Marked differences were found in chemical composition of sediment interstitial water. This was explained by different wind exposition of the two habitats. One is exposed to the main wind direction and can be characterized as erosion shore, the other one is mostly protected against wind and can be characterized as sedimentation shore. In first case, locally produced organic matter is transported away from littoral zone by autumn storms onto the shore or to deeper sites of the lake, where decomposition of organic matter takes place. In the other case, decomposition of locally produced organic matter takes place directly al production site. This results in high concentrations of ammonium and sulfid in sediment interstitial water showing strictly anaerobic conditions, whereas at the wind exposed site only little concentrations of ammonium and no sulfid was detectable. Apart from different resistence against wave action of the macrophyte species, different sediment interstitial water quality is considered to be the reason for the differences in species composition of the two macrophyte habitats.																			1253-8078						1995	142	6					651	657		10.1080/12538078.1995.10515288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.1995.10515288													WOS:A1995VC13400015
J	MASSE, AK; MURTHY, CR				MASSE, AK; MURTHY, CR			ANALYSIS OF THE NIAGARA RIVER PLUME DYNAMICS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Niagara River discharges into Lake Ontario at a typical rate of 6500 m3/s, and is the lake's principal source of suspended and dissolved materials. The discharge plume is frequently warmer and thus more buoyant than the surrounding lake surface water. Using thermal satellite imagery collected over a 4-year period, it was found that the plume executes an anticyclonic turn after exiting the river mouth in 53% of the images in which the plume is visible, while in 26% of the images the plume moves offshore. The cyclonic plume was the least common trajectory occurring in only 9% of the images. Temperature and velocity data are used to examine the buoyant anticyclonic plume. Estimates of the bulk shear Froude number suggest that the plume is unstable at the offshore edges of the turning region and stable in the interior. The stability of the interior is enhanced by the presence of a strong seasonal thermocline directly beneath the plume. The momentum balance within the plume is examined using a local coordinate system. Near the river mouth the plume is vertically mixed to the bottom and the large initial flow deceleration is balanced by bottom stress. Away from the river mouth the principal balance is between Coriolis acceleration, relative acceleration (inertial turning), and the cross-stream baroclinic pressure gradient.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				FEB 15	1992	97	C2					2403	2420		10.1029/91JC02726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC02726													WOS:A1992HE09100022
J	Charpin, MF; Maurin, N; Amblard, C; Devaux, J				Charpin, MF; Maurin, N; Amblard, C; Devaux, J			Seasonal variations of phytoplankton photosynthate partitioning in two lakes of different trophic level	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to compare vertical and seasonal variations of inorganic carbon allocation into macromolecules by the phytoplankton population in a eutrophic lake (Lake Aydat) and an oligo-mesotrophic lake (Lake Pavin). Biochemical fractionation was conducted by consecutive differential extractions in order to separate proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and low molecular weight compounds (LMW). The ratio of light absorption at 480 and 665 nm by acetone extracts of phytoplankton pigments was used as an indicator of the nutritional status of natural phytoplankton populations. Our results show that in Lake Aydat, the main photosynthetic end products were polysaccharides, whereas in Lake Pavin, radioactivity was predominantly incorporated into the protein fraction. Moreover, the seasonal cycles of mixing and stratification in these two lakes affected the pattern of C-14 incorporation into LMW and macromolecules. An increase in the relative synthesis of proteins occurred during stratification periods. It was linked to an increase in temperature and nutrient limitation further complicated by the shift in species composition of the populations. Differences recorded both between the two lakes of different trophic status and between seasons confirm that the proportion of carbon incorporated into proteins might be a useful indicator of the physiological status of phytoplankton communities.																			0142-7873					MAY	1998	20	5					901	921		10.1093/plankt/20.5.901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.5.901													WOS:000074194600007
J	Parish, SB				Parish, SB			Vegetation of the Mohave and Colorado Deserts of southern California	ECOLOGY												Great changes in the lakes and drainage of Mohave Desert have taken place due to desiccation since the Pleistocene. The desert mountain ranges, saline flats, and desert springs are described, and the rainfall and temp. conditions are outlined. The vegetation of Mohave Desert is briefly described without floristic detail. Cacti are not abundant and plants with water storing bulbs or roots are few. The low and arid Chuckawalla Range separates the Mohave Desert from the Colorado Desert. There are 545 spp. of truly desert plants in the former, only 282 of which are found in the latter. It is estimated that about -3 of the spp. in the Colorado Desert extend into the Mohave. The agency of topographic barriers in maintaining the floristic difference between the 2 deserts is discussed.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1930	11						481	499		10.2307/1929213	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929213													WOS:000200209700038

Past geological studies in this region focus mainly on initiation timing and million-year timescale variations in aridification. Few studies address the relationship between aridification and insolation forcing. Here we present a paleomagnetic and evaporite mineralogic study of the 476-m-long Huatugou (HTG) section (ca. 3.9 to 2.1 Ma) from the western Qaidam Basin. The results show that the drying of this part of the basin began by at least 3.9 Ma. Furthermore, we show that the relative content variation of evaporite minerals was dominated by 100-kyr cyclicity during the Pliocene. This is consistent with the result from the Xining area during the late Eocene. These results suggest that mid-latitude lacustrine evaporite minerals in semi-arid to arid regions are particularly sensitive to eccentricity forcing, improving understanding of aridification forcing at orbital timescales.

In both wetlands, feeding was selective for soft-rayed prey, mainly carp and goldfish (Carassius auratus). There was also positive selection for larger soft-rayed prey versus spiny-rayed prey. The survival rate (13 percent) for West Marsh was low, but growth was greater than reported in the literature, and stocked northern pike successfully reproduced. In Darr Marsh, survival was not measured, growth was high, and there was no evidence of reproduction when sampling ended in summer.																			0277-5212					DEC	1992	12	3					171	177		10.1007/BF03160606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160606													WOS:A1992KF84300004
J	Loch, TP; Faisal, M				Loch, Thomas P.; Faisal, Mohamed			Infection of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) with motile Aeromonas spp. in the Laurentian Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Infections with motile Aeromonas species were detected in lake whitefish collected over a one-year period from four stocks within lakes Michigan and Huron, USA. Sixty-nine isolates were recovered from the kidneys and swim-bladders of sixty-four infected fish. Representative isolates were Gram-negative bacilli that produced cytochrome oxidase, grew in the absence of salt, were facultative anaerobes, and were resistant to the vibriostatic agent 2,4-diamino,6,7-di-isopropylpteridine. Phenotypic characterization placed twenty-two isolates into the A. hydrophila complex, twelve into the A. sobria complex, and one into the A. caviae complex, while six isolates were characterized as A. allosaccharophila, two as A. veronii by. veronii, and one as A. popoffi. The prevalence of infection by motile aeromonads varied by site and season, with lake whitefish sampled in the summer having a significantly higher prevalence. Clinical signs in lake whitefish infected only with Aeromonas spp. included congestion and hemorrhaging in the fins and musculature; generalized pallor; congestion, hemorrhaging, and multifocal necrotic foci within the liver; moderate to severe splenomegaly; congestion and swelling of the kidneys; ascites within the peritoneal cavity; and hemorrhagic enteritis. This study provides evidence on the wide spread prevalence of motile aeromonad infections in lake whitefish stocks inhabiting northern lakes Michigan and Huron.

Development of an in-stream environmental exposure model for assessing down-the-drain chemicals in Southern Ontario	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												In order to address increased interest from scientists and regulators in quantifying environmental risks associated with release of common down-the-drain consumer products, a single-medium contaminant fate model for the lower St. Lawrence drainage basin in Southern Ontario was developed. The model was built within the pre-existing framework of the iSTREEM (R) in-stream environmental exposure model, which previously only contained US geographies. Data for the model were obtained from Canadian Government sources. In order to assess the model's strengths and limitations, concentrations of the chemicals triclosan and carbamazepine in surface water were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) generated by the model for both mean and low flow scenarios. Results of the PECs and the measured surface water concentrations were comparable, with the surface water concentrations generally falling in between the mean and low flow PECs on a cumulative distribution curve.

We investigated the effect of including DCA in the modified version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and its implication on future streamflow projection for the pothole dominated Assiniboine River Basin (ARB). The fill-and-spill processes that lead to DCA were captured using a physically-based approach, with a volumetric threshold to reduce the computational demand. Despite the challenges in accurately simulating prairie pothole hydrology, both in terms of timing and volume of runoff, the modified approach improved streamflow modelling performance, and reduced model uncertainty. Further, we evaluated the effects of representing DCA on projecting future streamflow by using eight statistically downscaled CMIP5 GCMs, forced with the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. End of century projections indicate increases in annual precipitation and temperature across the ARB, with decreasing summer precipitation relative to the 1976-2005 baseline period. Compared to the standard SWAT setup that does not allow for DCA, the modified model was found to be more responsive to climatic change with relatively larger projected increases in seasonal and annual flows at the majority of evaluated stations. This advance in DCA modelling will facilitate longer-term large basin-scale simulations that are more representative for the Prairie region.

No information was available, however, for the lakes in the north-eastern part of this basin. The north-eastern and the central and southern areas represent, at present, different environmental conditions: an important gradient exists between the dry north and the moister south. To investigate the late Pleistocene to Holocene characteristics of the north-eastern lakes in the basin of Mexico two parallel cores (TA and TB) were drilled at the SE shore of Lake Tecocomulco. Stratigraphy, magnetic properties, granulometry, diatom and pollen analyses performed on these sediments indicate that the lake experienced a series of changes between ca. > 42,000 yr BP and present. Chronological control is given by five radiocarbon determinations. The base of the record is represented by a thick, rhyolitic air-fall tephra that could be older than ca. 50,000 yr BP. After this Plininan event, and until ca. 42,000 yr BP, Lake Tecocomulco was a moderately deep, freshwater lake surrounded by extended pine forests that suggest the presence of cooler and moister conditions than present. Between ca. 42,000 and 37,000 yr BP, the lake became shallower but with important fluctuations and pollen suggests slightly warmer conditions. Between ca. 37,000 and 30,000 yr BP the lake experienced two relatively deep phases separated by a dry interval. A second Plinian eruption, represented in the sequence by a dacitic an air-fall tephra layer dated at 31,000 yr BP, occurred in the area by the end of this dry episode. Between ca. 30,000 and 25,7000 yr BP Tecocomulco was a fresh to slightly alkaline lake with a trend towards lower level. After ca. 25,700 yr BP very low lake levels are inferred, and after ca. 16,000 yr BP the data indicate the presence of a very dry environment that was persistent until the middle Holocene. After 3,500 yr BP lacustrine conditions were re-established and the vegetation cover shows a change towards higher percentages of herbaceous taxa.

Pohl population in the initial zone of floating mat on an oligo-humotrophic lake in north-eastern Poland	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												In the initial phase of growth in an oligo-humotrophic lake, Cladium mariscus forms a dense and tall sawgrass bed invading the open water in the form of a floating mat. High densities of submerged evergreen perennial stems of C. mariscus, over two metres high and abundantly fruiting, ensure its persistence, and form a natural barrier to the invasion of other species. Dense mats of sawgrass are formed as a result of clonal and rhizome growth. Although diaspore production is abundant under natural conditions, only vegetative propagation of stems was observed. In different variants of the experiment only seeds wintering on stems of mother plants were capable of germinating. Hard seed coats had an important effect on the germination capacity of seeds.																			0001-6977	2083-9480					2005	74	2					167	173																WOS:000229326200010

Most of the time, O3 concentrations were within the normal range (40-70 ppbv) for the location and season, but higher concentrations were measured during the afternoon flights at several isolated locations. During three afternoon flights, high O3 concentrations (> 120 ppbv) were observed along portions of the flight path; the highest 1-min average exceeded 160 ppbv. In two flights the highest O3 concentrations were observed in the lower boundary layer over the eastern portion of the flight track; in one case the high concentrations were found over the western side of the lake throughout the boundary layer. The increased O3 was accompanied by moderately increased SO2 and NOx (10-20 ppbv); outside the region of elevated O3, the SO2 and NOx were less than 2-3 ppbv. The elevated ozone concentrations were related to emissions from the urban region located near the southern and southwestern shores of Lake Michigan.																			0004-6981					DEC	1992	26	18					3265	3277		10.1016/0960-1686(92)90342-I	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(92)90342-I													WOS:A1992KG84700003

In 2002 mass appearances of this flagellate were found in three of 12 investigated humic lakes situated in the Eastern Poland. Lakes with Gonyostomum were situated within small geographical area. The biomass of algae was usually higher than 1 mg dm(-3) and during summer its distribution was frequently uneven with higher values found in deeper layers. Based on this research we conclude, that G. semen during its spreading on the new area had preferred 6-8 m deep and small lakes with thermal and oxygen stratification as well as with low calcium content, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline pH and moderate color of water.

J	Rutherford, JC; Schroer, D; Timpany, G				Rutherford, J. C.; Schroer, D.; Timpany, G.			How much runoff do riparian wetlands affect?	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Nitrate runoff from pastoral farming is of concern because it contributes to lake eutrophication. Surface flow in wetlands is a measure of the runoff likely to experience nitrate attenuation. This study assessed the potential of small headwater wetlands to reduce catchment nitrate loads by quantifying the proportion of total runoff that occurred as surface flow at the outlet of wetlands. Surface flow can be measured from wetlands in side valleys (valley wetlands) with well defined flow channels, but not in those parallel to the stream (riparian wetlands) with distributed flow. This study, from November 2004 to June 2008: (1) measured the mean specific flow yield (mm yr(-1)) at the outlet of 6 wetlands; (2) classified wetlands into 3 types based on hydrology; (3) mapped and classified all wetlands in the catchment; and (4) calculated the area-weighted mean specific yield of wetlands for the whole catchment. The 6.6 km(2) study catchment at Taupo, North Island, New Zealand, was predominantly pasture on volcanic soils where flows were baseflow dominated. Riparian and valley wetlands occupied 5% of catchment area. Type I wetlands flowed continuously, were dominated by baseflow (81-83%), and had a mean annual yield (+/- SE) of 167 +/- 46 mm (34% of stream yield). Type 2 wetlands dried up during droughts and type 3 wetlands dried up each summer. Both latter types had a low baseflow component (20%) and a yield of 66 +/- 18 mm (13% of stream yield). In one tributary, gaugings over 4 days in summer during a wet year indicated that 27% of streamflow originated from wetlands. For the catchment as a whole, wetland baseflow accounted for 11 +/- 4% of mean annual streamflow and wetland quickflow another 8 +/- 2%, although these percentages are likely underestimates because seepages occurred downslope from measurement points. Although riparian and valley wetlands occupied only 5% of the catchment area, they could potentially have attenuated nitrogen in 11-19% of runoff. Other catchments may have different hydrology and wetland nitrate attenuation, and the methods outlined here could be used to quantify these differences.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				DEC	2009	43	5					1079	1094		10.1080/00288330.2009.9626531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2009.9626531													WOS:000273718800007

Protozoa in a stressed area of the Egyptian Mediterranean coast of Damietta, Egypt	OCEANOLOGIA												The Damietta coast is part of the Egyptian Mediterranean coast off the Nile Delta and has recently been polluted as a result of intensive human activities. The environmental parameters and protozoan community in the area were studied biweekly from January to December 2007. The results of the environmental parameters indicated low salinity, oxic and anoxic conditions, high nutrient levels and intensive phytoplankton growth. A total of 69 protozoan species were identified, belonging to Amoebozoa (8 species), Foraminifera (12 species), non-tintinnid ciliates (22 species) and tintinnids (27 species). The numerical density of protozoans was high over the whole area, with annual averages between 8.2 x 10(3) cells m(-3) and 51.4 x 10(3) cells m(-3). Spring was the most productive season for protozoans, but several distinct peaks were observed during the year at the sampling sites. The protozoan groups showed clearly different spatial patterns in both composition and abundance: whereas amoebozoans and non-tintinnid ciliates were dominant in the more polluted areas (sites IV and V), tintinnids dominated in the less polluted areas (sites, I, II and III). Several pollution indicators were recorded: amoebozoans - Centropyxis aculeata, Centropyxis sp., Cochliopodium sp., Difflugia sp.; non-tintinnids - Bursaridium sp., Frontonia atra, Holophrya sp., Paramecium sp., Paramecium bursaria, Vasicola ciliata, Vorticella sp., Strombidium sp.; tintinnids - Favella ehrenbergii, Helicostomella subulata, Leprotintinnus nordgvisti, Tintinnopsis beroidea, Stenosemella ventricosa, Tintinnopsis campanula, T. cylindrica, T. lobiancoi, Eutintinnus lusus-undae.					; El-Tohamy, Wael/KLE-2099-2024	Qin, Jianguang/0000-0003-2448-8058; Dorgham, Mohamed/0000-0002-9239-8241; Elghobashy, Ahmed/0000-0002-3793-5307; Mostafa, Wael/0000-0002-2278-6441													0078-3234	2300-7370					2013	55	3					733	750		10.5697/oc.55-3.733	http://dx.doi.org/10.5697/oc.55-3.733													WOS:000324282500011

The discharge source is an improperly abandoned oil well that is leaking crude oil through fractures in the limestone bedrock. The discharge is carried to the surface in a spring, which then flows directly into Boyd's Creek and Barren River Lake, a recreational use lake managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Some of the unique technical and policy issues of this removal action include the appropriateness of using Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) monies on this nontraditional "oil spill"; difficulties recovering the product from the karst features; cost recovery and responsible party (RP) identification; and concerns over Emergency Response Program involvement in the long-term operation and maintenance of the system.																									1997							795	797																WOS:000073241400124

The GloboLakes project aimed to use satellite remote sensing data to investigate the response of the major lakes on Earth to environmental conditions and change. The main challenge to statistical modelling is the identification of the spatial structure in global lake ecological processes from a large number of time series subject to incomplete data and varying uncertainty. This paper introduces a comprehensive modelling procedure, combining adaptive smoothing and functional data analysis, to estimate the smooth curves representing the trend and seasonal patterns in the time series and to cluster the curves over space. Two approaches, based on an irregular basis and an adaptive penalty matrix, are developed to account for the varying uncertainty induced by missing observations and specific constraints (e.g. substantive periods of measurement values of zero in winter). In particular, the adaptive penalty matrix applies a heavier penalty to smooth curve estimates where there is higher uncertainty to prevent over-fitting the noisy/biased data. The modelling procedure was applied to the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) time series from 732 largest lakes globally and the lake chlorophyll -a time series from 535 largest lakes globally.

Determining the food composition and resource differentiation of the whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) and tundra swans (C. columbianus), can facilitate efforts to protect them. In this study, fecal microscopic analysis was conducted to analyze the feeding habits of whooper swans and tundra swans migrating to the Baotou Yellow River Wetland from February to May 2020; their food niche width and overlap were calculated, and the following results were obtained. The whooper swan's diet consisted of nine species from four families of plants, mainly corn (Zea mays), reed (Phragmites australis), and halophytes (Suaeda glauca). The diet of the tundra swan comprised eleven species from five families of plants, mainly corn, quinoa (Chenopodium album) and millet (Panicum miliaceum). The food niche widths of the whooper swan and tundra swan in the Yellow River Wetland in Baotou were 2.75 and 5.18, respectively. There were five main species of food plants in total, and the index of niche overlap was 0.65. The food diversity of the tundra swan was greater than that of the whooper swan, indicating that the Yellow River wetland provides relatively diverse food resources for the tundra swans and whooper swans, thereby reducing competition and facilitating coexistence.

In the 2010-2018 summer seasons, we investigated an Arctic flow-through lake system Revvatnet, located in the vicinity of the coastal zone of Hornsund fjord in Svalbard, characterising its hydrological properties and the chemical composition of its waters. The lake system comprises of a small upper lake and a large lower one, the latter cone-shaped, with -29.1 m maximum depth. With near-neutral pH (full range 6.5-8.4) and low EC (7-147 mu S cm-1), the lake has rather similar characteristics to many Arctic lakes. Metal and metalloid concentrations were either similar across the lake system or increased downstream (except Zn, which has important ore-bearing veins in the upper part of the catchment), which is consistent with the likely slow dissolution of suspended particles within the lakes. The Sigma PAHs concentrations ranged from <MDL to 2151 ng L-1, and according to the indicator PAHs concentration ratios, they originated from a mixture of combustion processes (they were not petrogenic). Principal component analysis showed that seasonal variability was the most characteristic feature of the chemical composition of these waters, although there appear to be consistent changes with time (sampling year) as well. Future research should explore the occurrence of high maxima in the concentrations of priority pollutants, such as PAHs, metals and metalloids (e.g. As). (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bell, T; Neill, WE; Schluter, D				Bell, T; Neill, WE; Schluter, D			The effect of temporal scale on the outcome of trophic cascade experiments	OECOLOGIA												The outcome of experimental manipulations in ecology should depend on the duration of the experiment. We tested this proposition by examining the results of published trophic cascade experiments in freshwater communities and the results of our own previously unpublished pond experiment. In particular, we analyze the results of 90 published trophic cascade experiments to test the prediction that the outcome of freshwater trophic cascade experiments, in which zooplanktivorous fish are either present or absent, depends on the duration of the experiment. We present evidence that there are quantitative differences in the strength of trophic cascades among different venue types (enclosure, mesocosm, pond, and lake), but that the strength of trophic cascades does not diminish with increasing experiment duration. Despite the large number of studies, there have been few replicated studies of trophic cascades for longer than a summer field season, and none for the time required to estimate the long-term result of press perturbations. We therefore present the results of a 4-year study of trophic cascades in experimental ponds, to test the predictions that the addition of the top predator results in a sustained increase in the phytoplankton biomass. We found that, as predicted by our literature review, there was no decline in the strength of the trophic cascade as the experiment progressed.					; Schluter, Dolph/AGM-4043-2022	Schluter, Dolph/0000-0003-1683-7836; Bell, Thomas/0000-0002-2615-3932; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	2003	134	4					578	586		10.1007/s00442-002-1135-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-002-1135-x								12647131					WOS:000181582700016

Image analysis showed that the transgressive dunefield had continuously moved inland from the lakeshore and experienced three major stages between 1970 and 2020: Stage 1 (1970-1996), the dunefield moved slowly (1.40 m/yr); Stage 2 (1996-2013), the dunefield moved rapidly (15.66 m/yr); and Stage 3 (2013-2020), the movement of the dunefield slowed down (7.70 m/yr). The grain size characteristics of the surface sediments indicated that material from the lakeshore was transported inland, undergoing continuous sorting and transformation by the wind. By combining the ERA5-Land dataset and meteorological data to assess the environmental changes, it was found that the correlation between the wind and the changes in dunefield movement speed was weak, as the wind speed progressively weakened throughout the study period. However, the deceleration or acceleration of the dunefield movement often corresponded to the advance or retreat of the shoreline as the lake level rose or fell. This was because the change of the lake level and shoreline indirectly affected the movement speed by regulating the sand supply. Furthermore, the lake level and shoreline change in Qinghai Lake were still primarily controlled by climate change. In general, this study offers a valuable example of transgressive dunefield development along the lakeshore and traces its evolution over the past 50 years by multisource image data. The results suggest that transgressive dune sheets or dune fields can evolve directly from the lakeshore. It also indicates that transgressive dunefields are initiated as a response to the water level fall in cold and arid environments with abundant sand supply.

Inland Fisheries Habitat Management: Lessons Learned from Wildlife Ecology and a Proposal for Change	FISHERIES												The habitat concept in inland fisheries has been less studied than wildlife ecology. Since 1950, the cumulative number of publications about freshwater or inland habitat and fisheries management has been 60%-95% less than those considering habitat and wildlife management. The number of publications about marine, river, and stream habitat and fisheries management has also generally exceeded those for lake habitat and fisheries management. We provide a perspective comparing inland fish and wildlife habitat management systems and highlight lessons from wildlife ecology that could benefit inland fisheries. We reason that wildlife habitat management has become widespread and accepted because humans share habitats with wildlife and positive/negative responses to habitat restorations/loss are directly observable. We recommend that inland fisheries habitat studies and restorations include opportunities for humans to directly observe the ecological benefits of such practices. To support aquatic habitat management efforts, we suggest that dedicated funding solutions be considered to mitigate aquatic habitat loss. In theory, such a system would provide benefits to inland fish populations that parallel those provided to wildlife through state and federal stamps. Although aquatic habitat conservation and restoration may not solve management issues as rapidly, it will promote long-term sustainability and resiliency of diverse inland fish populations.

Based on imagery taken at summer coastal haul-out sites on the islands of the Valaam Archipelago in northern Lake Ladoga in 2019 and 2020, a photo-identifi cation database for the endangered Ladoga ringed seal (Pusa hispida ladogensis) has been developed. We based individual identifi cation on unique patterns visible on the seal pelt and demonstrated the utility of this approach to ringed seal monitoring. The current version of the database contains 537 individual seals. When possible, the sex and age class of individuals were recorded, as well as individual resightings within one day, intra- and inter-seasonal resightings. At the haul-outs, the female-to-male ratio was about 1:1.16, and 2.3% of the animals were young-of-the-year. The intra-season resighting percentage was 2% in 2019 and 2.3% in 2020, whereas the inter-annual resighting rate was only 1.3%, indicating low haul-out site fidelity and substantial rotation across seal groups using the islands during the open-water season.

Of 333 oligochaetes collected in a fish farm in the State of Sao Paulo, three (0.9%) released Aurantiactinomyxon type spores. From 86 worms collected in a fish farm in Mato Grosso do Sul State, 1 (0.9%) released actinospores with a novel morphology for which we propose the name Seisactinomyxon.

This is the first report of the involvement these two species of oligochaetes in the life cycle of myxozoans. Small subunit rDNA sequences of the Aurantiactinomyxon (1204 nt) and Seisactinomyxon (1877 nt) did not match any previously sequenced myxozoan.

After the experimental removal of fish from the Main Lake, the following effects were observed: 1. Invertebrate (chironomid and gastropod) food for ducklings and adult Tufted ducks increased substantially. 2. Tufted duckling brood use of the lake increased greatly and Tufted duckling survival appears to have increased. 3. Shoveler and Pochard nested successfully for the first time. 4. Submerged aquatic macrophytes grew profusely over the lake bed for the first time leading directly to large increases in use of the Lake by wintering herbivorous waterfowl. 5. When fish were re-introduced to the Main Lake sampling bay the increases in invertebrate abundance and, to a less marked extent, macrophyte abundance were reversed. Fish removal is advocated as a potentially potent form of habitat management for waterfowl conservation areas.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						387	392		10.1007/BF00027870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027870													WOS:A1994NK39900036

Ice thickness, hydraulic hazards, climate variability and associated warmer air temperatures have always raised safety concerns and uncertainty among those who travel floating ice road routes. One way to address safety concerns is to monitor ice conditions throughout the season. We tested ground penetrating radar (GPR) for its ability and accuracy in measuring floating ice thickness under three specific conditions: 1) presence of snow cover and overflow, 2) presence of snow cover, and 3) bare ice, all common to Interior Alaska rivers. In addition, frazil ice was evaluated for its ability to interfere with the GPR measurement of ice thickness. We collected manual ice measurements and GPR cross-sectional transects over 2 years on the Tanana River near Fairbanks, Alaska, and for 1 year on the Yukon River near Tanana, Alaska. Ground truth measurements were compared with ice thickness calculated from an average velocity model created using GPR data. The error was as low as 2.3-6.4% on the Yukon River (Condition 3) and 4.6-9.5% on the Tanana River (Conditions 1 and 2), with the highest errors caused by overflow conditions. We determined that certain environmental conditions such as snow cover and overflow change the validity of an average velocity model for ice thickness identification using GPR, while frazil ice accumulation does not have a detectable effect on the strength of radar reflection at the ice-water interface with the frequencies tested. Ground penetrating radar is a powerful tool for measuring river ice thickness, yet further research is needed to advance the ability of rural communities to monitor ice thickness using fewer time-intensive manual measurements to determine the safety of ice cover on transportation routes.

Its optimum conditions prevailed during the summer months, when densities of >500 ind, m(-3) were recorded. First, males appeared by the mid/end of August, while maximum resting egg production occurred in September. At temperatures below 10 degrees C the population declined. At high population levels, L, kindti caused suppression of its preferred prey item, the juveniles of Diaphanosoma mongolianum. Twenty-five to 45% of juvenile Diaphanosoma can be eliminated by Leptodora. This predation impact is a pronounced but short-term event. During the periods of high Leptodora densities, a significant relationship between Leptodora predation and the death rate of Diaphanosoma is found. The older developmental instars of L. kindti are themselves endangered by the impact of planktivorous fish (i.e. Pelecus cultratus, Alburnus alburnus), which show a preference for Leptodora larger than 6 mm. Frequently, elimination by fish corresponds with high death rates of Leptodora. During the periods when adult Leptodora occurred in numbers >50 ind. m(-3), 55% of the variance connected with its death rate can be attributed to fish predation. The success of this population of L. kindti is discussed within the framework of predator-prey interactions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 7	1995	307	1-3					273	282		10.1007/BF00032021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00032021													WOS:A1995RY51900033

With the refinement of sample preparation and measurement protocols, a linear relationship of dose with the peak-to-peak height of the radiation-induced signal at g = 2.0034 was established. A dedicated analysis algorithm was developed to process batches of samples, eliminating the need for manual peak-to-peak height measurement. Varying background EPR signals were identified in different sampling groups, with samples gathered in winter having a markedly lower background signal. Through optimisation of spectrum acquisition normalisation methods, it was possible to resolve doses as low as 0.2 Gy. This work provides further validation that EPR dosimetry of shelled species has the potential to contribute to better characterisation of absorbed doses in aquatic environments.																			0144-8420	1742-3406				SEP 18	2023	199	14					1626	1631		10.1093/rpd/ncad152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rpd/ncad152								37721081					WOS:001076080600028

Long-term impact of de-icing salts on tree health in the Lake Tahoe Basin: Environmental influences and interactions with insects and diseases	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Lake Tahoe, on the boundary of California and Nevada, is world renown for its natural beauty and is also a popular location for winter-sporting activities. De-icing compounds, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), are used to maintain safe winter driving conditions. Sodium chloride, however, can damage roadside vegetation and affect surface and ground water quality. Our objectives were to: investigate the relationship among salt damage to trees and other damage (from insects, diseases, and other biotic and abiotic factors), examine the effects of vegetation characteristics and environmental factors on salt damage to trees, and to quantify the long-term impacts of de-icing salts on roadside conifers in the Tahoe Basin. From 2006 to 2008, 442 square plots (0.1 ha) were established and surveyed throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin, including 176 control plots > 300 m from roads, and 137 plots originally established in 1990 that were used for long-term trends. Both incidence and severity of salt damage, diseases, insect pests, and other abiotic damage were recorded on all trees within plots (more than 10,000 trees). Soil and vegetation samples were collected from a subset of plots and analyzed for salt content. At least 15% of roadside trees were damaged by salt every year. Very large year-to-year variation in the incidence of salt damage was observed, but the severity of salt damage has decreased since 1990. A clear roadside effect on roadside conifers existed because symptoms of salt damage were only observed on trees in roadside plots and never in control plots, and foliage from trees in roadside plots had more sodium and chloride content than those in control plots for both salt symptomatic and asymptomatic foliage. Incidence of salt damage decreased with increasing distance from roads, was more frequent on rocky soils, and increased with downhill slope steepness and tree density. Pines (Pinus spp.) were more frequently and severely damaged by salt than firs (Abies spp.). Trees were more likely to be damaged by something other than salt, and the relationship among salt damage and other damages was antagonistic rather than synergistic. The results from this study have important implications for the ecology and management of conifer forests in relation to salinity and road maintenance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The timing of these events corresponds with evidence for an increase in the amount of melt on the adjacent Agassiz Ice Cap, as recorded in ice cores. There appears to have been a non-linear change in depositional energy resulting from a dramatic increase in Agassiz meltwater discharge, particularly after similar to1908. A strong correlation between the Lake Tuborg varve thickness record, the amount of melting on the Agassiz Ice Cap and Eureka 900 mb air temperature records suggests that changes in the height of the freezing level in the atmosphere have affected the extent of summer melting on the Agassiz Ice Cap, leading to high volume discharge events and associated sediment flux to Lake Tuborg.

INCA-C, a process-based model of climate effects on surface water [DOC], was used to explore the mechanisms by which changing climate controls seasonal to inter-annual patterns of [DOC] in the lake and outflow stream of a small Finnish catchment between 1990 and 2003. Both production in the catchment and mineralization in the lake controlled [DOC] in the lake. Concentrations in the catchment outflow were controlled by rates of DOC production in the surrounding organic soils. The INCA-C simulation results were compared to those obtained using artificial neural networks (ANN). In general, "black box" ANN models provide better fits to observed data but process-based models can identify the mechanism responsible for the observed pattern. A statistically significant increase was observed in both INCA-C modelled and measured annual average [DOC] in the lake. This suggests that some of the observed increase in surface water [DOC] is caused by climate-related processes operating in the lake and catchment. However, a full understanding of surface water [DOC] dynamics can only come from catchment-scale process-based models linking the effects of changing climate and deposition on aquatic and terrestrial environments.

G.; Huang, Yongsong			Alkenone-based reconstruction of late-Holocene surface temperature and salinity changes in Lake Qinghai, China	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Few proxies can provide quantitative reconstructions of past continental climatic and hydrological changes. Here, we report the first alkenone-based reconstruction of late Holocene temperature and salinity changes in Lake Qinghai, China. The alkenone-temperature proxy ( U-37(k')) indicates up to a 1 degrees C change in mean annual air temperature or a 2 degrees C change in summer lake water temperature during the late Holocene. Oscillating warm and cold periods could be related to the 20th century warm period, the Little Ice Age, the Medieval Warm Period, the Dark Ages Cold Period, and the Roman Warm Period. The relative importance of C-37: 4 alkenone to total C-37 alkenone production (% C-37: 4) fluctuated between 15 - 45%, with higher values during warm periods, suggesting that lake water was also fresher during these periods. The coupled late Holocene surface temperature and salinity changes suggest that Asian monsoons strongly influenced the climate of the Lake Qinghai region.

Nitrogen limitation of heterotrophic biofilms in boreal streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Nutrient limitation of the biofilm is fundamental to stream ecosystem processes, as microbial activity shapes the biological availability and biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. We used nutrient-diffusing substrata (NDS) to investigate heterotrophic nutrient limitation of microbial respiration (MR) across 20 streams draining boreal landscapes in northern Sweden. We also explored variation in microbial biomass and community structure of biofilms that developed on NDS using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers. Limitation was determined as a significant response of MR and biomass production on cellulose surfaces to enrichment with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or N+P, relative to controls. Microbial respiration was N-limited, with an average 3.3-fold increase on N-amended NDS. Nitrogen limitation decreased, and control rates of MR increased, with greater background concentrations of inorganic N across the sites. In contrast to MR, microbial biomass was primarily N-limited but was greatest for the N+P NDS. Accordingly, differences in respiratory versus biomass responses to nutrient addition resulted in significantly greater biomass-specific MR on N-amended NDS compared to all other treatments. In addition, PLFA biomarkers indicated distinct microbial communities on N and N+P NDS compared to controls and/or P NDS. Greater MR and biomass, and the development of distinct microbial communities, when supplied with inorganic N suggest that factors which alter aquatic N loading during autumn may have important implications for ecosystem processes and the biogeochemistry of boreal streams and rivers. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that the productivity of Fennoscandian boreal landscapes is constrained by N availability.

This article focuses on complex interactions among climate change impacts on various bio-physical and socio-economic components of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region ecosystems. The magnitude of climate change impacts can be traced from impacts, such as pre-monsoon drought to crop failure and outmigration of people. The interconnectedness of the ecosystem components makes the Climate Change impacts complex, and often has a cascading effect across various environmental systems. We shed light on how climate change effects get intensified by interacting with other anthropogenic factors. There is a need to devote more concerted efforts to generate primary data, and document evidences to understand the complexity and interconnectedness of CC impacts to address sustainable development issues in the Himalayan mountains.

Spatial-temporal variations in DOM composition and bacterioplankton community structures were evaluated using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, gray influence analysis (GINA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). Principal component analysis revealed pronounced seasonal variations of DOM in urban rivers and estuaries, whereas DOM dynamics in lakes were primarily driven by precipitation. Reservoir DOM showed significant fluctuations aligned with summer floods. GINA identified eutrophication-related DOM component C5 as the primary factor influencing microbial communities in lakes and reservoirs, while industrially derived DOM component C6 markedly affected bacterioplankton in river environments. SEM further quantified these influences, highlighting temperature and industrial inputs as critical drivers. These findings provide crucial insights into DOM-microbial interactions, emphasizing adaptive water management strategies tailored to distinct DOM sources and seasonal conditions to preserve ecological health and water quality in complex catchments.

J	CHAPMAN, LJ; MACKAY, WC				CHAPMAN, LJ; MACKAY, WC			ECOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF FEEDING FLEXIBILITY IN NORTHERN PIKE (ESOX-LUCIUS)	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We describe the summer diet and habitat use of northern pike (Esox lucius) in a small lake where potential fish prey were limited to one other species. During May, June, and July, pike fed almost exclusively on invertebrates. In August the diet was characterized by an increase in the frequency of vertebrates, a decrease in the number of prey items per stomach, an increase in mean prey size, and in increase in the percentage of empty stomachs. Direct observation by snorkel and SCUBA did not reveal a shift in the spatial distribution of pike during June, July, and August. Highest densities were recorded in shallow water with tall, penetrable vegetation. We suggest that the observed dietary change was not related to variation in habitat use, but rather to a change in the abundance of prey in the littoral zone.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1990	5	3					313	322		10.1080/02705060.1990.9665245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1990.9665245													WOS:A1990DT31200008

Due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of available satellite data, previous studies mainly focused on lake-scale investigations of melting/freezing, hindering the detection of subtle patterns within heterogeneous landscapes. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a new approach for fine-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic lake ice-off phenology. Using the Scene Classification Layer data derived from dense Sentinel-2 time series images, we estimated the pixel-by-pixel ice break-up end date information by seeking the transition time point when the pixel is completely free of ice. Applying this approach on the Google Earth Engine platform, we mapped the spatial distribution of the break-up end date for 45,532 lakes across the entire Arctic (except for Greenland) for the year 2019. The evaluation results suggested that our estimations matched well with both in situ measurements and an existing lake ice phenology product. Based on the generated map, we estimated that the average break-up end time of Pan-Arctic lakes is 172 +/- 13.4 (measured in day of year) for the year 2019. The mapped lake ice-off phenology exhibits a latitudinal gradient, with a linear slope of 1.02 days per degree from 55 degrees N onward. We also demonstrated the importance of lake and landscape characteristics in affecting spring lake ice melting. The proposed approach offers new possibilities for monitoring the seasonal Arctic lake ice freeze-thaw cycle, benefiting the ongoing efforts of combating and adapting to climate change.

Remote sensing offers a unique potential to provide synoptic monitoring at daily time scales complementing in-situ sampling activities occurring in Lake Erie. Bio-optical remote sensing algorithms require knowledge about the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water for parameterization to produce robust water quality products. This study reports new IOP and apparent optical property (AOP) datasets for western Lake Erie that encapsulate the May-October period for 2015 and 2016 at weekly sampling intervals. Previously reported IOP and AOP observations have been temporally limited and have not assessed statistical differences between IOPs over spatial and temporal gradients. The objective of this study is to assess trends in IOPs over variable spatial and temporal scales. Large spatio-temporal variability in LOPS was observed between 2015 and 2016 likely due to the difference in the extent and duration of mid-summer cyanobacteria blooms. Differences in the seasonal trends of the specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient between 2015 and 2016 suggest differing algal assemblages between the years. Other IOP variables, including chromophoric, dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and beam attenuation spectral slopes, suggest variability is influenced by river discharge and sediment re-suspension. The datasets presented in this study show how these IOPs and AOPs change over a season and between years, and are useful in advancing the applicability and robustness of remote sensing methods to retrieve water quality information in western Lake Erie.

Meanwhile, it has not been comprehensively investigated how high- and low-latitude forcings, as crucial driving factors of global climate change, impact regional hydroclimate on various timescales during the MIS 2. This study applies phytolith-based principal component 1 scores, sum proportions of grain size-based end-members 2 and 3, and values of loss-on-ignition at 550 degrees C from the Dadong profile, to provide new evidence of hydroclimate changes during the MIS 2 in NE China. The results suggest that the regional humidity was low during the Last Glacial Maximum, and gradually increased during the subsequent Last Deglaciation. Additionally, the typical climate pattern of "warm-humid/cold-dry" in the EAM region was showed during a series of millennial oscillations. Combined with multiple records from NE China, it is observed that the orbital-scale hydroclimate changes during the MIS 2 were relatively consistent in different regions, and were mainly regulated by the ice sheet extents under the control of Northern Hemisphere high-latitude summer insolation. On the millennial scale, however, the hydroclimate changes suggested significant asynchrony or even anti-phase, indicating that the climate pattern may not always be similar to the typical EAM pattern. We propose that a series of sea-land-air interactions under the coupling of North Atlantic Deep Water activities in high latitudes and El Nino-Southern Oscillation in low latitudes, may be responsible for this complicated pattern. This study provides new insights into the climate evolution in NE china and its relationship with the high- and low-latitude forcings, which is beneficial for the explanation of mechanisms behind climate variability in this region.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				JAN 1	2025	347								109084	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109084		NOV 2024											WOS:001365201100001

This research was co-designed with Inuit to investigate reported changes in anadromous Arctic char in waters near Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada. An analysis of semi-structured interviews with 26 Inuit fishers not only documented changes in Arctic char population abundance, spatial movement, appearance, and taste, but also changes in access to the fishery. Over the past several decades and becoming pronounced in recent years, fewer fish, and specifically fewer medium-sized fish, which are preferred by fishers, have been caught using nets near the settlement, with some showing poor body condition, and others appearing to originate from lakes outside of the expected spatial range, earlier in an extended, summer coastal fishing season. Inuit have observed changes in individual fish, as well as broader environmental changes that disrupt fishing activities. These changes include: an increasing prevalence of Pacific salmon; warmer air and marine sea surface temperatures; inconsistent sea and lake ice conditions; stronger and more frequent wind and wave activity; fluctuating water levels in rivers; and a seasonal tunicate bloom. Inuit have responded to these changes by altering personal subsistence fishing practices and temporarily halting a small-scale, community-based commercial fishery because of observations in stock declines and in order to prioritize the subsistence fishery.

These pelagic aggregates provide a niche for microbes that can exploit these physical structures and resources for growth, thus are local hot spots for microbial activity. However, processes underlying their formation remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of chemical signaling between two co-occurring bacteria that each make up more than 10% of the community in iron-rich lakes aggregates (iron snow). The filamentous iron-oxidizing Acidithrix strain showed increased rates of Fe(II) oxidation when incubated with cell-free supernatant of the heterotrophic iron-reducing Acidiphilium strain. Amendment of Acidithrix supernatant to motile cells of Acidiphilium triggered formation of cell aggregates displaying similar morphology to those of iron snow. Comparative metabolomics enabled the identification of the aggregation-inducing signal, 2-phenethylamine, which also induced faster growth of Acidiphilium. We propose a model that shows rapid iron snow formation, and ultimately energy transfer from the photic zone to deeper water layers, is controlled via a chemically mediated interplay.

An Investigation of Cold-Season Short-Wave Troughs in the Great Lakes Region and Their Concurrence with Lake-Effect Clouds	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The downwind shores of the Laurentian Great Lakes region often receive prolific amounts of lake-effect snowfall during the cold season (October-March). The location and intensity of this snowfall can be influenced by upper-tropospheric features such as short-wave troughs. A 7-yr cold-season climatology of 500-hPa short-wave troughs was developed for the Great Lakes region. A total of 607 short-wave troughs were identified, with an average of approximately 87 short waves per cold season. Five classes of short-wave troughs were identified on the basis of their movement through the Great Lakes region. This short-wave trough dataset was subsequently compared with the lake-effect cloud-band climatology created by N. F. Laird et al. in 2017 to determine how frequently short-wave troughs occurred concurrently with lake-effect cloud bands. Of the 607 short-wave troughs identified, 380 were concurrent with lake-effect clouds. Over 65% of these 380 short-wave troughs occurred with a lake-effect cloud band on at least four of the five Great Lakes. Short-wave troughs that rotated around the base of a long-wave trough were found to have the highest frequency of concurrence. In general, concurrence was most likely during the middle cold-season months. Further, Lake Michigan featured the highest number of concurrent events, and Lake Erie featured the fewest. It is evident that short-wave troughs are a ubiquitous feature near the Great Lakes during the cold season and have the potential to impart substantial impacts on lake-effect snowbands.

Mapping polar atmospheric features on Titan with VIMS: From the dissipation of the northern cloud to the onset of a southern polar vortex	ICARUS												We have analyzed the complete archive of the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data in order to monitor and analyze the evolution of the clouds and haze coverage at both poles of Titan during the entire Cassini mission. Our objective is to give a cartographic synopsis from a VIMS perspective, to provide a global view of the seasonal evolution of Titan's atmosphere over the poles. We leave the detailed comparison with the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) data sets to further studies. We have computed global hyperspectral mosaics for each of the 127 targeted flybys of Titan to produce synthetic color maps emphasizing the main atmospheric features. The north pole appears fully covered by a huge cloud as soon as the first observations in 2004 and up to the equinox in 2009 (Le Mouelic et al., 2012). The northern skies then became progressively clearer, after the circulation turnover in 2009, revealing the underlying lakes and seas to the optical instruments up to 2017. The reverse situation is observed over the south pole, which was mostly clear of such a high obscuring cloud during the first years of the mission, but started to develop a polar cloud in 2012. This feature grew up month after month until the end of the mission in 2017, with a poleward latitudinal extent of 75 degrees S in 2013 up to 58 degrees S in April 2017. Thanks to the spectral capabilities of VIMS, we have detected HCN spectral signatures over the north pole in almost all flybys between 2004 and 2008. These HCN signatures started then to show up over the south pole in almost all flybys between 2012 and 2017, so perfectly matching the timing and spatial extent of the northern and southern polar atmospheric features.

Material collected during the fall has multiples sources; in addition to material already in suspension and bottom material resuspended from the immediate area, some material appears to be derived from the Niagara River delta. This is the first reported instance of bottom resuspension in the Great Lakes at depths below wave base during the unstratified period that has been confirmed by current velocity measurements.																			0380-1330						1996	22	3					707	721		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70991-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70991-7													WOS:A1996VQ49100018

While the importance of the thermal environment for the growth of fish is undisputed, the relevance of maternal effects for offspring growth in the wild is largely unknown. Otoliths of 366 age-0 pike (Esox lucius L.) were sampled in a natural lake over three seasons. All offspring were assigned to more than 330 potential mothers using 16 informative microsatellites. We found temperature and past maternal environment (as represented by juvenile growth rate), but not female total length, to jointly contribute to explain within- and among-season size variation in juvenile pike. While there was no statistical evidence for maternal effects on offspring growth rate, fast female juvenile growth positively correlated with the offspring length in early summer. One mechanism could be related to fast-growing females spawning somewhat earlier in the season. However, the more likely mechanism emerging in our study was that fast-growing females could have been in better condition prior to spawning, in turn possibly producing higher numbers of high-quality eggs. Our study is among the few to reveal carry-over effects related to past maternal environments on offspring performance in a naturally reproducing fish stock. At the same time, our study underscores recent arguments that size-dependent maternal effects may not be expressed in the wild and that early hatching does not generally produce size advantages in light of stochastically varying temperature conditions.					; Wolter, Christian/F-6210-2014; Bekkevold, Dorte/AAT-1098-2021; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010	Wolter, Christian/0000-0002-2819-2900; Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X; Bekkevold, Dorte/0000-0002-5297-032X; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				AUG	2015	178	4					951	965		10.1007/s00442-015-3301-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3301-y								25894093					WOS:000358089400001

Very similar PCB patterns were observed in all samples; the main components possess the -245, -234, -2345 chlorine substitution. Contamination levels varied with the lipid content of the tissues. The highest concentrations were found in liver in the range 100-700 ng g-1 dry weight for the PCB congener No. 153 (22'44'55' hexachlorobiphenyl). The concentrations in liver and muscle increased with age for both male and female fish. Gonads from male fish showed continued low contamination. However, the contamination in gonads from mature female fish (> 2 years) varied during the year: the highest concentrations were observed in early spring, just before the spawning which is an important pathway for the elimination of these contaminants.

Most organisms belonged to taxa characteristically found in shallow waters elsewhere in New Zealand, but new distributions for the rare cladocerans Neothrix armata, Monospilus dispar and Ephemeroporus barroisi were recorded, and the presence of Simocephalus acutirostratus in New Zealand was confirmed. Darkly pigmented Daphnia carinata were recorded for the 1st time as also were co-occurring Boeckella triarticulata and B. dilatata. Cluster analysis of the data from both areas identified 3 groups of taxa with a high probability of co-occurrence. Some species were absent from all the sites in 1 area but present at several sites in the other. This may reflect differences in adaptation to drought, or the limited sampling regime, but is also consistent with the areas being in different ecological districts. Ponds which still contained water in late autumn were sampled for pH (6.7-7.0), conductivity (K20, 17-79 .mu.Siemens cm-1), Na (0.35-4.60 mg l-1), Cl (0.89-5.68 mg l-1) and osmolality (21-37 mosmolar).																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	2					197	210		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516042													WOS:A1984TM67200009

In addition to direct evaluation of means and ranges of the physical and chemical characteristics, a cluster analysis was carried out using alkalinity, color and chlorophyll a data. Three well-defined clusters emerged that appeared to be controlled by hydrology: A, dominated by surface runoff; B, dominated by groundwater; and C, dominated by precipitation. Relationships between morphometric, hydrologic and terrigenous factors that can influence lake water quality and susceptibility were further examined by discriminant analysis of 18 watershed properties across the 3 lake clusters. Hydrologic factors were important in differentiating the low and high alkalinity lakes. The potentially sensitive low alkalinity lakes in northcentral Wisconsin lack surface inlets or outlets and their chemistry is closely associated with precipitation chemistry.

In this study, the impact of accumulated algal blooms in reed wetlands in the littoral zones of Chaohu Lake was investigated seasonally from 2018 to 2019. The concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were much higher in the reed-covered littoral zones (RCLZ) than in the unvegetated littoral zones (ULZ), indicating that more algal biomass was trapped and accumulated in the RCLZ. Algal biomass could be horizontally transported to downwind littoral zones under low wind speeds, favoring the establishment of blooms. Algal accumulation levels were highest in summer due to high water temperatures and algal biomasses. Likewise, the northern littoral zones were conducive to the development of large algal blooms because of the wind pattern. The values of TN, TP, Chl a, and loss on ignition in surface sediments were higher in the RCLZ than in the ULZ. Moreover, the diffusive fluxes of ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus were also higher in the RCLZ than in the ULZ. Considering the capability of reed wetlands to trap algae, mechanical salvage and other physical methods should be adopted to eliminate algal biomass when massive blooms accumulate in the RCLZ.

Dan			Lake surface and downstream river temperature response to the retreat of a lake-terminating glacier	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Glacier contributions to streamflow moderate summer water temperatures and help keep rivers cool during periods of hot, dry weather. As glaciers retreat, the length of channel exposed to solar radiation above a given point of interest would increase, which should ultimately result in higher water temperatures. However, formation of proglacial lakes may complicate river temperature response to glacier retreat. This study examined river and lake temperature response to the retreat of lake-terminating Bridge Glacier, British Columbia, using a combination of manual spot and continuous river temperatures at a stream gauge, lake surface temperatures derived from Landsat imagery, and in situ lake temperatures made during a field campaign during summer 2013. Temperature data spanned the period from 1984 to 2022. Lake and river temperatures were relatively constant prior to and during a period of rapid retreat, but exhibited an upward trend following 2012, when iceberg density declined due to an apparent decrease in calving rate, resulting in an increase in lake surface area and river temperature of about 5 degrees C even though the glacier remained lake terminating. In addition to providing the first longitudinal study of water temperature response to the retreat of a lake-terminating glacier, this study adds to a body of literature that demonstrates that routine spot river temperatures, if collected in a consistent manner over a number of years, can provide valid information about river and stream temperature trends. Lake surface and downstream river temperatures did not initially exhibit a significant warming trend during a period of rapid glacial retreat. However, changes in glacier flow dynamics associated with thinning and a reduced area of floating ice resulted in a decline in iceberg density even though the glacier remained lake terminating. This decrease in iceberg density was associated with increases in lake and river temperatures of approximately 5 degrees C over a decade. image					Moyer, Alexis/AAA-2245-2021; Pelto, Ben/ABH-4955-2020	Browning, Billy/0009-0001-8490-3519; Bird, Lawrence/0000-0001-6541-2768													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY	2024	38	5							e15150	10.1002/hyp.15150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15150													WOS:001251018900001

Surveys were conducted between April and Oct. at 2 adjacent power plants in the southern basin and at 1 plant in the northern basin of the lake. Fish densities in plume and reference areas differed seasonally. Densities typically differed by a factor of 2-4 although on 1 occasion plume area density was 90 times greater. Highest plume densities occurred during late spring when alewife Alosa pseudoharengus) were spawning inshore. Consistently dense congregations of fish were found downstream of the interfaces between ambient shore-parallel currents and discharge flows. The general distribution of fish with depth was similar in all areas. Differences between plume and reference areas were related to the discharge type: at canal discharges fish tended to congregate inshore while at the offshore discharge they congregated in deeper zones. Fish also tended to occupy shallower depth strata in all plume areas. Positive correlation between fish density and increasing temperature was common at both plume and reference areas during all 3 seasons, but more frequent at plume areas. Temperatures selected by fish in plume areas were 1-3.degree. C higher than maximum ambient temperatures.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	2					305	315		10.1139/f82-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-042													WOS:A1982NE25700010

First we use shortwave and longwave data from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station at Bratt's Lake, Saskatchewan, and clear sky radiative fluxes from ERA-Interim, to show the coupling between the diurnal cycle of temperature and relative humidity and effective cloud albedo and net longwave flux. Then we calibrate the nearby opaque cloud observations at Regina, Saskatchewan in terms of the BSRN radiation fluxes. We find that in the warm season, we can determine effective cloud albedo to 0.08 from daytime opaque cloud, and net long-wave radiation to 8 W/m(2) from daily mean opaque cloud and relative humidity. This enables us to extend our analysis to the 55 years of hourly observations of opaque cloud cover, temperature, relative humidity, and daily precipitation from 11 climate stations across the Canadian Prairies. We show the land-surface-atmosphere coupling on daily timescales in summer by stratifying the Prairie data by opaque cloud, relative humidity, surface wind, day-night cloud asymmetry and monthly weighted precipitation anomalies. The multiple linear regression fits relating key diurnal climate variables, the diurnal temperature range, afternoon relative humidity and lifting condensation level, to daily mean net longwave flux, windspeed and precipitation anomalies have R2-values between 0.61 and 0.69. These fits will be a useful guide for evaluating the fully coupled system in models.

Most of the few records of such past sea-level changes in Antarctica are those derived from raised beach ridges. Many studies using raised beach ridges to reconstruct past sea levels across Antarctica commonly assume that they only record falling sea levels. However, their internal architecture may contain a record of other oscillations in relative sea-level (RSL) change. In this study, we examine the internal architecture of a well-developed set of raised beach ridges on Livingston Island of the Antarctic Peninsula using 10+ km of ground penetrating radar (GPR). Recalibrated published radiocarbon ages are used in combination with new optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages to compare beach morphology and stratigraphy to the glacial history of the region. Within this flight of raised beach ridges, evidence was found for both regressive and transgressive depositional patterns marked by progradational seaward dipping facies deposited during periods of RSL fall followed by erosion and deposition of landward dipping overwash and aggrading beds during interpreted periods of RSL rise. This succession is routinely located over a notch in the bedrock interpreted to represent a wave-cut feature. The ages of raised beach ridges underlain by wave-cut notches and composed of landward-dipping strata correlate with known Holocene ice advances at <500, similar to 2000, and similar to 5000 cal yrs BP. We propose that these transgressive phases are the result of glacial-isostatic adjustment (GIA). This GIA hypothesis further supports recent assertions of a much more dynamic RSL history for Antarctic coastlines, which may contaminate the Last Glacial Maximum RSL signal across Antarctica.					; Simms, Alexander/E-5609-2012	Simms, Alexander/0000-0001-5034-2189; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUL 1	2025	359								109363	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109363		APR 2025											WOS:001477379800001

This study focuses on the organic matter accumulation and carbon sequestration under the PETM by the Kongdian Formation in the Cangdong Sag, Bohai Bay Basin using petrography, geochemistry, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The PETM happened in the second member of the Kongdian Formation (Ek2) which experienced a process of warm-dry to hot-humid to warm-dry variations. Hence the Ek21-2 section has been divided into pre-, core-, and post-PETM. During the pre-PETM, a continuous hot climate strengthened the evaporation to induce the lake salinizing which aggravated water stratification and reducing condition. Intense hydrological cycle resulted in rising terrestrial flux and falling salinity, and more oxidic water column at the corePETM stage. The salinity continuously falls from the highest point at the post-PETM stage, corresponding to the evaporation weakening and terrestrial input increasing. This caused gradually weakening water stratification and oxidic water column. More saline and reducing conditions promoted the boom of aquatic organism and favorable preservation, so more saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons have been formed at the pre- and postPETM stages. By contrast, the core-PETM section contains more higher plants with unfavorable preservation, generating less asphaltene. Combined with carbonate and TOC contents, the interplay of organic-inorganic carbon sequestration occurred at the pre- and post-PETM stages, distinct from that at the core-PETM. Injection of light oil from the pre- and post-PETM sections leads to high OSI values of the core-PETM which has good shale oil potentials.																			1367-9120	1878-5786				JUL 1	2025	288								106606	10.1016/j.jseaes.2025.106606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2025.106606		APR 2025											WOS:001470792000001

An additional benefit would be formation of a low-oxygen refuge for large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton in the metalimnion. The magnitude and timing of hypolinmetic oxygenation was deliberately manipulated during summer 1997 in Irondequoit Bay, a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment (New York, USA), to maintain metalinmetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the range of 1-2 mg/L. We assessed the vertical distributions of fish and zooplankton in 1997, a year with controlled oxygenation, and 1996, a year with oxygenation but without a deliberate attempt to create amenable refuge conditions. After initiation. of oxygenation, June through early August metalimnetic DO in 1997 was 1.8 +/- 0.5 mg/L (means 2 SE), whereas metalimnetic DO in 1996 was 3.8 +/- 1.0 mg/L. Hydroacoustic surveys in 1997 and gillnet catches in both years indicated that >96% of planktivorous fish, alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides), were restricted to depths with DO > 4.0 mg/L. A refuge effect in 1996 was slight and evidenced only by significantly larger zooplankton in the metalimnion while densities of Daphnia galeata medotae and D. retrocurva were similar or significantly greater in the epilimnion. In 1997, the refuge effect was strong despite an almost twofold increase in planktivorous fish abundance compared to 1996. Overall zooplankton densities were similar in the epilimnion and metalimnion while zooplankton size and densities of both daphnids were significantly greater in the metalimnion. Densities of an invertebrate predator, Mesocyclops edax, were also significantly higher in the metalimnion compared to the epilimnion. Despite high fish abundance in 1997, mean summer (late May through August) chlorophyll a decreased 29% compared to 1996, consistent with expectations from grazing by large Daphnia protected in the refuge. Presence of large-bodied zooplankton in 1997 despite high planktivore abundance demonstrated that successful creation of a low-oxygen refuge from fish predation was possible in an open Great Lakes embayment where traditional biomanipulation via fish removal was not practical.

Circulation characteristics, such as interdecadal variations in regional persistent cold event frequencies, are the focus of this study. During the 57-year period, a subperiod from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s exhibits inactive characteristics compared with those before and after during the study period. On a subseasonal timescale, the typical circulation patterns of persistent cold events are characterized by wave-train anomalies across the Atlantic Ocean and Eurasian continent, with significantly positive height anomalies that persist over the Ural Mountains in the upper troposphere, positive SLP anomalies over Eurasian mid- to high latitudes and cold SAT anomalies from Lake Balkhash to Lake Baikal. The changes in background circulation at the interdecadal timescale correspond well with the typical circulation patterns at the subseasonal timescale, indicating their important role in modulating the frequency of persistent cold events. Interdecadal changes in the background circulation can be partially explained by transient eddy feedback forcing.					wang, xiao/HGB-7081-2022; Shi, Ning/ABP-4222-2022	Shi, Ning/0000-0002-4769-1609													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	2019	52	5-6					3729	3739		10.1007/s00382-018-4353-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4353-6													WOS:000463842700068

The succession of different taxa of phytoplankton results in a succession of zooplankton taxa, and within the genus Daphnia, into a succession of different genotypes (clones). One cause for this succession of Daphnia clones might be the production of digestive protease inhibitors by cyanobacteria, which usually bloom in summer. Here we report seasonal changes in the frequency and the abundance of Daphnia magna haplotypes in a eutrophic lake, which developed a chymotrypsin-inhibitor-producing cyanobacterial bloom in May. These seasonal changes were not related to changes of biotic and abiotic lake parameters. However, a very high content of chymotrypsin inhibitors was observed in May (but not in other months). This was assumed to have exerted a strong punctual selection pressure on the Daphnia population and on the direct targets of the protease inhibitors, i.e. the digestive chymotrypsins of Daphnia. Actually, D. magna from before and during the cyanobacterial bloom showed a different protease pattern on activity stained SDS-PAGE in comparison to clones from the month after the bloom. However, no difference in tolerance, measured as IC50 values, to inhibition by natural lake seston from May was found between the clones from before and after the bloom. Thus, the hypothesis that a seasonal adaptation of D. magna subpopulations from either April/May or June might have occurred could not be proven. This suggests that the Daphnia population investigated here is locally adapted to cyanobacterial protease inhibitors.					von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018	von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; Schwarzenberger, Anke/0000-0002-5877-8726													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2013	75	3					433	445		10.1007/s00027-013-0290-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-013-0290-y													WOS:000323901900009

The paper uses and describes the method of measuring radon in water using AlphaGUARD measuring system and method of sampling water from Modrac Lake as well as springs and wells in the seismically active zones of the Tuzla region. The results were compared with reference values from the literature and the estimated doses and risks to the health of people living in seismically active zones of the Tuzla region.																			1840-4855	2233-0046					2012		7					11	18		10.5825/afts.2012.0407.011S	http://dx.doi.org/10.5825/afts.2012.0407.011S													WOS:000445820100002
J	SCRIBNER, KT; WARREN, RJ				SCRIBNER, KT; WARREN, RJ			SEASONAL DEMOGRAPHY AND MOVEMENTS OF COTTONTAIL RABBITS ON ISOLATED PLAYA BASINS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We examined spatial and temporal changes in population density, age structure, and individual movement distances of eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) on 2 plays lake basins in the Texas Panhandle [USA]. We obtained 1,857 captures of 931 individual rabbits during 7,450 trap nights from February through November 1981. Population densities during prereproductive periods were 8.2 and 11.6 cottontails per ha on playa basins A and B, respectively. Subsequent changes in density were related to reproductive recruitment and to dispersal. Densities peaked at 28.4 and 26.9 cottontails per ha on playa basins A and B, respectively, during summer trapping periods. Adult: juvenile ratios declined coincident with the production of 7 litters. Distribution of captures within each playa basin and dispersal patterns were related to seasonal maturation and harvest of surrounding crops. A greater (P < 0.05) proportion of captures occurred in peripheral than interior portions of the playas during periods of crop maturation (May and Jun) and during or after crop harvest (Sep), indicating cottontails may have used surrounding agricultural habitats when available. Data from 223 adults and 112 juveniles captured .gtoreq. 2 times revealed that seasonal movement distances reflected the availability of habitats (i.e., crops) surrounding playa basins.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JUL	1990	54	3					403	409		10.2307/3809647	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809647													WOS:A1990DR13900007

It is of uncertain taxonomic position and was, recently classified within dinoflagellates (Ebriales). Subsurface accumulation of H. adriaticum ZACH. (UP to 380,000 cells I-1) was found around the brackish/seawater interface (BSI), in a small, saline coastal lake (Lake Rogoznica, central Adriatic coast), from March to November 1994. Dense populations of this species may be found only in stratified ecosystems with a well defined oxic/hypoxic (anoxic) - H2S enriched boundary layer. In Lake Rogoznica such conditions coincided with the BSI. The increasing gradient of phosphate, nitrate, ammonia and silicate concentrations provided evidence of a sharp chemocline below the BSI. In winter, an advective transport of H. adriaticum population was evident in the southeastern Adriatic; by an inflowing northerly current from the eastern Mediterranean.																			0003-9365					APR	1997	147	3-4					373	379		10.1016/S0003-9365(97)80061-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9365(97)80061-9													WOS:A1997WZ97100013
J	POST, JR; EVANS, DO				POST, JR; EVANS, DO			EXPERIMENTAL-EVIDENCE OF SIZE-DEPENDENT PREDATION MORTALITY IN JUVENILE YELLOW PERCH	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Adult yellow perch, Perca flavescens, when offered equal numbers of small (52-59 mm total length) and large (66-73 mm total length) conspecifics, selected more small than large prey in 9 of 11 laboratory feeding trials. The small and large groups were selected from the smallest 40% and largest 15% of a natural length-frequency distribution of young-of-the-year yellow perch captured in the fall of 1985 from Dickie Lake, Ontario [Canada]. The adult yellow perch predators ranged in size from 23.2 to 26.8 cm total length. Our experiment suggests that smaller individuals of a juvenile yellow perch cohort have a greater risk of mortality owing to size-selective predation than do larger individuals. Factors that affect the growth rate of juvenile yellow perch may therefore influence recruitment by modifying the extent of size-dependent predation mortality.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1989	67	2					521	523		10.1139/z89-076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-076													WOS:A1989T799400043

The earliest of these, Zone I, is characterized by relatively low numbers of chrysophyte cysts, oligostenothermal planktonic diatoms, and benthic diatoms associated with deepwater habitats. The transition from Zone I to II is characterized by increased production, particularly by species of the diatom genus Melosira, which reach maximum abundance in the mid-portion of Zone II. Zone III assemblages contain relatively high abundance of planktonic diatoms which grow in the summer epilimnion. Assemblages in Zone I appear to have been deposited prior to substantial human intervention in the lake Superior ecosystem. The transition from Zone I to Zone II appears to reflect settlement effects which occurred between ca. 1850 and 1900. Zone III appears to reflect further increases in nutrient loading, beginning ca 1950.

The results showed that CH4 concentrations in the Fengle, Hangbu, and Nanfei rivers ranged from 56.33-124.79, 160.82-341.03, and 213.49-716.81 nmol L-1, respectively, over a daily cycle; while the saturation of CH4 ranged from 188.72-418.07, 538.74-1142.46, and 715.23-2401.38%, respectively, which indicated that surface waters were in all cases oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere. An obvious diurnal variation pattern of the dissolved CH4 concentrations demonstrated a higher value during daytime but a lower value for night time. Additionally, the highest dissolved CH4 concentrations were detected in the Nanfei River which received substantial urban wastewater discharges. CH4 emissions measured with floating chambers ranged from 5.82-15.46, 5.77-8.41, and 13.51-49.25 mg C m(-2) h(-1) for the Fengle, Hangbu, and Nanfei rivers, respectively, over a daily cycle. Significantly higher CH4 emissions were also observed from the Nanfei River. The accumulative CH4 emissions for each river increased with time, while a decline trend on the accumulation rates was investigated over the consecutive 72 h.

The relative abundance of these remains, along with other characteristics of the core, allows the development of a coherent picture of the progress of Ace Lake from a species-poor, freshwater lake early in the Holocene to a biodiverse marine basin following a marine transgression. Subsequent sea level fall reformed Ace Lake as a saline lake and productivity initially increased after isolation. After a major event, possibly associated with overturn of the meromictic lake, biodiversity and productivity decreased, and have continued to do so until the present. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Principal component variables and more traditional climatic variables such as heat sums are presented. To facilitate comparison of spatially distributed variables, a procedure is described for estimation of climatic statistics for areas between weather stations. The procedure is objective and provides a measure of its error. Like any regression procedure, it improves with availability of more data. Extension of climatic statistics to a 5 .times. 5 km grid covering the state of Michigan was used to create contour maps for a number of climatic statistics with potential relevance for plant growth. In addition, a large number of climatic statistics were summarized using principal component analysis. Separate analyses were made for winter temperature and precipitation, growing season temperature, growing season precipitation, and a combination of variables possibly related to stressful conditions. There was a high degree of correlation among many of the statistics. The correlations were due to global climatic controls and to moderation due to the Great Lakes. Principal component variables successfully presented major climatic trends. However, for ecological use they appeared to offer few advantages over more traditional climatic statistics.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				JUL	1987	17	7					598	612		10.1139/x87-101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x87-101													WOS:A1987J856500005

Methane Bubble Size Distributions, Flux, and Dissolution in a Freshwater Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The majority of methane produced in many anoxic sediments is released via ebullition. These bubbles are subject to dissolution. as they rise, and dissolution rates are strongly influenced by bubble size. Current understanding of natural methane bubble size distributions is limited by the difficulty in measuring bubble sizes over wide spatial or temporal scales. Our custom optical bubble size sensors recorded bubble sizes and release tithing at 8 locations in Upper Mystic Lake, MA continuously for 3 months. Bubble size distributions were spatially heterogeneous even over relatively small areas experiencing similar flux, suggesting that localized sediment conditions are important to controlling bubble size. There was no change in bubble size distributions over the 3 month sampling period, but mean bubble size was positively correlated with daily ebullition flux. Bubble data was used to verify the performance of a widely used bubble dissolution model,. and the model was then used to estimate that bubble dissolution accounts for approximately 10% of methane accumulated in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, and at most 15% of the diffusive air-water-methane flux from the epilimnion.						/0000-0002-5981-2500													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 5	2017	51	23					13733	13739		10.1021/acs.est.7b04243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b04243								29116771					WOS:000417549500022

Repeating earthquakes in the Yellowstone volcanic field: Implications for rupture dynamics, ground deformation, and migration in earthquake swarms	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We evaluated properties of Yellowstone earthquake swarms employing waveform multiplet analysis. Thirty-seven percent of the earthquakes in the Yellowstone caldera occur in multiplets and generally intensify in areas undergoing crustal subsidence. Outside the caldera, in the Hedgen Lake tectonic area, the clustering rate is higher, up to 75%. The Yellowstone seismicity follows a succession of two phases of earthquake sequence. The first phase is defined between swarms. It is characterized by a decay of clustering rate and by foreshock-aftershock sequences. The second phase is confined to swarms and is characterized by an increase in clustering rate, and dominant aftershock sequences. This phase reflects tectonic swarms that occur on short segments of optimally oriented faults. For example, the largest recorded swarm in Yellowstone occurred in autumn 1985 on the northwest side of the Yellowstone Plateau which was initiated as a tectonic source sequence. Fitting experimental dependence of fluid injection with intrusion migration suggests that the 1985 swarm involved, after 10 days, hydrothermal fluids flowing outward from the caldera. The 2008-2009 Yellowstone Lake swarm exhibited a high migration rate of 1 km/day, a decrease in clustering rate without a main-shock, and appears to be associated with magma injection of 1 to 5 m(3)/s in a succession of migrating magma fronts that incrementally solidify and fracture at its brittle edges. The 2010 Madison Plateau earthquake swarm on the west side of the caldera initiated as a tectonic sequence but the expansion of the swarm front was associated with hydrothermal fluid migration.

Twenty-two hexanucleotide sequence recognition endonucleases were used, of which six (Ava I, Bst EII, Cla I, Dra I, Nco I, and Sca I) revealed polymorphisms between fish. Nine mitochondrial clones were resolved which fell into two major groups that differed in their Nco I and Sca I fragment patterns. The "A" group predominates in the eastern Great Lakes, while the "B" group predominates in the west. The geographical distribution of these two groups suggests that Great Lakes walleye persisted in at least two refugia during the last glaciation. The study revealed several rare mitochondrial genotypes which may prove useful in creting genetically marked brood stocks. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, such markers would provide information on both the survival and long-term reproductive success of stocked fish.

J	Momii, K; Ito, Y				Momii, Kazuro; Ito, Yuji			Heat budget estimates for Lake Ikeda, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Heat budget studies of takes are essential components of efficient take water management as they give direct information on evaporation and thus the take water budget. A one-dimensional heat transfer model which includes vertical turbulent mixing in take water and heat exchange between the take and the atmosphere was developed and applied to estimate heat budget of Lake Ikeda from 1981 to 2005. The take is in southern Japan has a mean water depth of 125 m, and is an important water resource for agriculture, municipal water supply, and fisheries. The computed take water temperatures were in good agreement with observed temperatures. The model reproduced both the thermal stratification characteristics and the uniform vertical 10 degrees C temperature profile that occurs in Lake Ikeda every February. When the storage heat was suitably quantified, the latent heat computed on a monthly basis by the model. also agreed well with those calculated by both the Bowen ratio and Priestley-Taylor methods. Analysis of the heat budget for a 25-year period from 1981 to 2005 showed that the take accumulates heat from March to August and releases it through latent and sensible heat under a small net radiation condition from September to February. Maximum latent heat occurs in October and minimum talent heat in April. The annual average evaporation is 938 mm and the autumn evaporation from September to November accounts for about 40% of the total annual evaporation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Adverse effects of stratification include decreasing pollutant retention capacity, causing the water at lower depths to become anoxic, degrading water quality and increasing stress on the downstream aquatic communities. The current study reports on a comprehensive field monitoring program of stratification and hydrodynamics in two ice-free seasons (May - October) in two constructed urban stormwater wetlands in Calgary, Canada, with different inlet, outlet, morphometric and vegetation designs. Despite their small sizes of 0.5 and 1.2 ha and shallow water depths of 0.8 m, stratification was strong and persistent in the wetlands. The response of stratification and mixing to atmospheric forcings (e.g., air temperature, atmospheric instability, rainfall depth, wind speed) and the impact of design characteristics (inlet/outlet design, water depth, surface area and aquatic vegetation) were examined and discussed. Thermal stratification, defined as a vertical temperature gradient >1 degrees C/m, was found to be significantly higher (up to ten times) near the inlets and last longer (up to twice) than in the main cells and the outlet basins due to the relatively cold summer inflows. The wetland with twice the permanent water volume and surface area and half the length-to-width ratio had denser submerged aquatic vegetation, higher (by up to 2 degrees C) water temperature and more severe (up to eight times) thermal stratification. Strong densimetric stratification and low wind stress on the water surface caused hypoxic conditions near the bed, potentially adversely affecting water quality and downstream aquatic communities.					; Ghobrial, Tadros/AAM-5072-2020; Loewen, Mark/E-5645-2013	Ghobrial, Tadros/0000-0002-7620-7433; Loewen, Mark/0000-0002-6854-5926; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 10	2023	872								162179	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162179		FEB 2023						36791861					WOS:000965579200001

Changes in climate and human-induced factors significantly influence the state of lake ecosystems. This study provides evidence of the driver, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR) indicators for freshwater lake ecosystem dynamics, taking Lake Malombe in Malawi as a case study. We used the DPSIR framework and Tobit model to achieve the study's objectives. The study's findings indicate that top-down processes gradually erode Lake Malombe's ecosystem state. The lake resilience is falling away from its natural state due to increasing rates of drivers, pressures, and impacts, indicating the lake ecosystem's deterioration. The study shows that demographic, socio-economic, climatic drivers, pressures, state, and responses significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the lake ecosystem's resilience. The study suggests that substantial freshwater ecosystem management under the current scenario requires a long-term, robust, and sustainable management plan. The findings from this study provide a roadmap for short-term and long-term practical policy-focused responses, particularly in implementing a freshwater ecosystem restoration programs in Malawi and Africa more broadly.					; MAKWINJA, RODGERS/AAM-5741-2020; Mengistou, Seyoum/MVU-3709-2025; Agumassie, Tena/AAL-3707-2021	Kaonga, Chikumbusko/0000-0002-0185-9357; Alamirew, Tena/0000-0001-7491-4401; Kosamu, Ishmael Bobby Mphangwe/0000-0001-5463-6897														2073-4441				FEB	2022	14	4							619	10.3390/w14040619	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14040619													WOS:000762484900001

However, how different categories of roughness lengths affect the lake surface energy exchange and the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) remains unclear in the TP lakes. In this study, we used a tuned Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.6.1 to investigate the responses of the freezeup date, turbulent fluxes, meteorological variables, and PBLH to surface roughness length variations in Ngoring Lake. Of all meteorological variables, the lake surface temperature responded to roughness length variations most sensitively; increasing roughness lengths can put the lake freeze-up date forward. The effect of momentum roughness length on wind speed was significantly affected by the fetch length. The increase in the roughness length for heat can induce the increment of the nightly PBLH in most months, especially for the central lake area in autumn. The primary factors that contribute to sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (LE) were the roughness lengths for heat and momentum during the ice-free period, respectively. Increasing roughness length for heat can increase the nightly PBLH, and decreasing roughness length for moisture can also promote growth of the PBLH, but there was no obvious correlation between the momentum roughness length and the PBLH.

Of particular interest is the relative amount of snow accumulation in talus areas, Talus areas play an important role in alpine hydrology because these areas have been shown to provide water late into the summer growing season. One reason that talus areas may provide important sources of water late into the growing season is because they accumulate more snow than other landscape types in alpine basins. The roughness of talus areas reduces the redistribution of snow by wind, which may cause an increase in accumulation. Furthermore, talus areas are often located beneath steep rock faces, and these areas may accumulate relatively high amounts of snow due to sluffs and avalanches. Snow surveys were conducted at maximum accumulation in the Green Lakes Basin in the Colorado Front Range during the years 1997 through 2000. This basin has been extensively studied in the past, and the major landscape types have been mapped and digitized onto a GIS. Using a combination of field measurements and geostatistical techniques we have estimated the distribution of snow water equivalent throughout the basin and compared it to the mapped landscape types.																			0161-0589						2001							115	118																WOS:000174272100016

The objective of this study was to identify the population dynamics and the major drivers of P. rubescens blooms. Samples for qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton were collected every month in 2014 and 2015 from stationary depths, while the main physical parameters were measured in situ along the water column. Samples for chemical analysis were collected below the surface, at mid-depth (metalimnion) and near the bottom. In the periods of thermal stratification, P. rubescens formed the maximum biomass in the metalimnion, however, its volume-weighted biomass reached the maximum value in the winter mixing period (4.40 mm(3) l(-1)). Changes in the P. rubescens population in the reservoir were related to changes in the measured environmental parameters. Significant physical, hydrological, meteorological and chemical parameters were distinguished based on the multivariate analysis.

L-1) lake, triacylglycerols (energy reserve lipids were the most abundant lipid class followed by phospholipids and sterols. Marked seasonal differences in patterns of total and energy reserve lipid content in the herbivorous calanoid Leptodiaptomus sicilis were correlated with temporal patterns in edible algal biomass and temperature. The appearance of particular algal species, or groups of similar-sized species, occurred synchronously with changes in lipid content of both L. sicilis and Daphnia pulex. These periods of changing lipid content were used to infer nutritional suitability or inadequacy (unavailability) of specific algae for wild populations ot zooplankton. Energy transfer from phytoplankton to the carnivorous calanoid Hesperodiaptomus nevadensis through L. sicilis involved a time lag of approximately 1-2 mo; this was hypothesized to result from a feeding dependency on L. sicilis copepodites due to a gape limitation of the predator. Demographics of D. pulex in this lake were unusual because the species was consistently absent during spring. In addition, total lipids and triacylglycerols were low (< 15% and < 4.5 mug . animal-1, respectively), suggesting that D. pulex had been pushed into a subsistence niche by the rising salinity levels.					; Arts, Michael/H-4973-2012; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; Arts, Michael/0000-0002-2335-4317; 													0706-652X					NOV	1993	50	11					2404	2420		10.1139/f93-265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-265													WOS:A1993MZ45600013

Potential factors leading to the formation of cyanobacterial scums in a mesotrophic softwater lake in Ontario, Canada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												While the factors linked to the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms are well studied, the specific conditions that facilitate transition of blooms to surface scums are less understood. Three Mile Lake (TML), a mesotrophic, softwater lake in south-central Ontario, Canada, experienced cyanobacterial blooms in 2005, 2006, and 2007, but a surface scum event only occurred in 2005. Our objectives were therefore to (1) determine how phytoplankton change seasonally in relation to water quality and other environmental factors; (2) examine modern and historical water quality and meteorological data to explore possible causative factors of the 2005 surface scum; and (3) examine regional predictions of future climate (temperature and precipitation) from present to 2100 to assess the risk of future cyanobacterial scums. Our evaluation suggests that while high phosphorus concentration is a predisposition for the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, meteorological and hydrological conditions play an instrumental role in the actual development of surface scums. The 2005 scum event occurred during the fall period when air temperature was unusually high and wind speed and precipitation were low. Consequently, runoff from the surrounding catchment, and thus flushing, was minimal. We believe all these factors interacted to prolong thermal stratification and increase residence time, thereby promoting the proliferation of cyanobacteria and formation of surface scums. Our modeled climate data indicate that the frequency of scum occurrence will change over time as climatic change paves the way for the meteorological conditions that promote scum development.

Changes in glacier and glacial-lake surface areas in the Reserve between 1975, 1992 and 2005 have been estimated using remote sensing and GIS techniques that have integrated field data from 2009, 1:50,000 scale topographic maps, ASTER satellite data from 2009, and Landsat MSS/TM images in 1975, 1992 and 2005. By 2005, the glacier surface area had declined from 596.52 to 451.58 km(2) with a total area loss of 144.94 km(2), and glacial lakes had increased from 3.55 to 7.87 km(2), an increase of 121.69 %. The volume of glaciers was reduced by 69.99 km(3) from 1975 to 2005. The observed changes in the extent of glaciers are in line with the observed atmospheric warming in the Rongxer basin. Records from the Tingri station and Nyalam station have revealed warming during the ablation season since the 1970s at a rate of 0.03-0.04 degrees C a(-1) in the northern and central Rongxer basin. At higher elevations in the study area, represented by the Tingri and Nyalam meteorological stations, the summer warming was accompanied by negative anomalies in annual precipitation since the 1970s, likely enhancing glacier retreat and glacial lake expansion.

The Distribution and Seasonality of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in the Vertical Water Column of a Stratified Eutrophic Freshwater Lake	ENVIRONMENTS												The vertical distribution and potential variability of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the water column of lacustrine systems is important to know for sampling and monitoring purposes, but could also relate to details of their fate, transport, and distribution. In this study, the water column of a eutrophic freshwater lake (Lake Monona, Madison, WI, USA) was sampled vertically for PFAS during summer stratification at several depths (surface microlayer to 1 m from the bottom) and then monitored at four dates and three depths the following year to assess seasonality. PFAS concentration did not exhibit vertical stratification or large variability in the water column. However, seasonal variation in PFAS concentration was detected, as well as an increase in PFAS concentration related to drought conditions. This study suggests that a surface water grab sample may be a sufficient representative of the water column for the basic monitoring of PFAS. But a single sample during the year may not provide a complete understanding of the lake, and multiple samples should be taken to capture and understand important seasonal events.																				2076-3298				FEB	2025	12	2							48	10.3390/environments12020048	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments12020048													WOS:001431724900001
J	Juggins, S				Juggins, Steve			Quantitative reconstructions in palaeolimnology: new paradigm or sick science?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Quantitative reconstructions from biological proxies have revolutionised palaeolimnology but the methodology is not without problems. The most important of these result from attempts to reconstruct non-causal environmental variables and from the effects of secondary variables. Non-causal variables act as surrogates for often unknown or unquantified ecological factors and the method assumes that these relationships are invariant in space and time. This assumption is almost never met and examples of diatom models for water depth and summer temperature demonstrate how violation leads to spurious and misleading reconstructions. In addition, comparison of published species optima indicate that a number of models have little or no predictive power outside their current spatial setting. Finally, experiments using simulated training sets of known properties demonstrate how changes in secondary "nuisance" variables can lead to large, consistent, and interpretable trends in a reconstruction that are completely spurious and independent of any real change in the reconstructed variable. These problems pervade many quantitative reconstructions in palaeolimnology and other disciplines. Palaeoecologists must give greater attention to what can and cannot be reconstructed and explicitly address the dangers of reconstructing surrogate and confounded variables if our reconstructions are to remain credible.

Mollusks in the zoobenthos of relict lakes with abnormally high biological production in the eastern European subarctic	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Species diversity and density of mollusks have been studied in Vashutkiny Lakes (Bol'shezemel'skaya Tundra, northeastern Europe). These lakes are comparable to northern boreal lakes in mollusk species diversity and density levels. Two hypotheses proposed by Zvereva are analyzed: on the relict origin of the ecosystem of these lakes and on the leading role of intrazonal factors in the formation of their abnormally high level of production. Both hypotheses are confirmed by recent data. The production of these lakes is mainly determined by their flowing regime, which offers intense convective heat exchange between water masses and suprapermafrost taliks under the lakes and leads to the accumulation of summer heat in friable Quaternary sediments, which are widespread in lake depressions. Intense water exchange together with strong wind-induced mixing hinders the stratification of water masses.

The flood-induced turbidity current plays a dominant role in the seasonal dynamic of suspended matter in the Liuxihe Reservoir (23 degrees 4550N; 113 degrees 4652E), a large, stratified reservoir at the Tropic of Cancer in southern China. Field measurements show that loading and distribution of suspended matter in the reservoir differ in typical wet, dry and medium years, as a result of different discharge volumes and water level variation patterns. Using historical data and the practical demand for water supply and flood control, we generalized two feasible reservoir operational modes: flood impounding mode (drawing down the reservoir to a low level before flood events to impound inflow during the flooding season) and moderate level change mode (drawing down the reservoir to a moderate level before flood events, then keeping the level within the flood control level during runoff events). To examine the effects of different operational modes and outlet depths on the reservoir's flood-induced turbidity current, a numerical simulation model was applied in three types of hydrological conditions. The results show that the mode with moderate drawdown and recharge processes can decrease loading of suspended matter in spring and promote turbidity current release during flood events, and upper withdrawal can improve the effects of turbid water release. We suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality management in the reservoir operation stage, severe artificial water level fluctuation being avoided and selective withdrawal becoming an optional management measure.

We analysed GPS telemetry data of 15 adult Ospreys breeding in northeast Germany, assigned to 37 non-breeding events at non-breeding sites in Africa and south-western Europe. We calculated seasonal home ranges and investigated daily movements as well as overnight roosts. The females arrived in Africa about one month before the males. The home ranges of males correlated with those reported for their respective breeding seasons and were similar in size to those of the females. Half of the non-breeding sites were established on rivers, 36% on the coast and 14% on lakes, with no difference between sexes. Ospreys tracked for more than one year always returned to the same non-breeding sites. Daily home-range sizes varied during the non-breeding period, with the largest home ranges found in January, in parallel with the dry season. The average number of nights per overnight roost was lowest for river habitats and was related to the overall home-range size of the individuals. We highlight the importance of non-breeding sites for the survival of populations and suggest further studies to detect and mitigate threats to migratory bird species.

The primary driver of the EHTE was an anomalous large-scale barotropic high-pressure (anticyclone) centered over Lake Baikal. The lower to middle levels northerlies over the southeastern flank of the anomalous anticyclone suppressed air moisture and cloud cover over northern China, which increased downward shortwave radiation and consequently elevated SAT in the region. A comparison of global circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in October 2023 with historical anomalies associated with SAT over northern China during 1979-2022 suggests that abnormal North Atlantic tripole (NAT) SST anomalies and the Indo-Pacific zonal SST gradient (IPG) were potential origins of the record-breaking EHTE. Further observations and numerical simulations demonstrated both the NAT and IPG triggered downstream- and poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains. These wave trains contributed to the formation of the anomalous high-pressure over Lake Baikal, leading to reduced cloudiness and elevated SAT over northern China. A physical-based prediction model, utilizing the precursors from the two oceanic origins, outperformed two dynamical models with lead times from zero to three months. It successfully predicted the record-breaking EHTE in 2023, a feat that the dynamical models failed to achieve.

Sharp differences in the δ13C values of organic matter and carbonate encrustations but not in ambient water DIC between two morphologically distinct charophytes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The stable carbon isotope composition of the carbonate encrustations (delta C-13(CARB)), organic matter (delta C-13(ORG)) and the dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) in the ambient lake waters were analysed for two common but morphologically different and, thus, representing different growth forms of Chara species. We hypothesized that the relationships between delta C-13(CARB), delta C-13(ORG) and delta C-13(DIC) are species specific and related to the different growth forms of the studied charophytes. For each species (Chara tomentosa and Chara globularis), 10 individuals and water samples from above the macrophytes were collected in five lakes at three sites per lake in mid-summer. Opposing shifts were found between delta C-13(CARB) and delta C-13(DIC) values with C-13 enrichment in C. tomentosa and C-13 depletion in C. globularis. In addition, C. globularis exhibited more negative values of delta C-13(ORG) than C. tomentosa, even under similar conditions. The delta C-13(CARB) and delta C-13(ORG) values were positively correlated in both species, but delta C-13(CARB) and delta C-13(DIC) as well as delta C-13(ORG) and delta C-13(DIC) were positively correlated in C. tomentosa only. The differences found result from the different proportions between C-13 and C-12 in DIC used as a CO2 source for photosynthesis, which is linked to the different growth forms represented by the two studied charophytes and, thus, are species specific as we hypothesized.

Geoffrey			A quantitative blueness index for oligotrophic waters: Application to Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The perceived blue color of a lake often contributes to its aesthetic appeal, and changes in blueness can be indicative of major shifts in water quality. We developed a quantitative blue water index (B-w) for natural waters, and used it to evaluate spatial and seasonal variations in ultraoligotrophic Lake Tahoe, where clarity and blueness are of ecological and economic value and a focus for lake management strategies. Spectral reflectance was measured using a profiling hyperspectral radiometer, and the values were converted to the axis values of a color space: the International Commission on Illumination L*a*b*, where L* is the lightness of color, a* ranges from green to magenta, and b* ranges from blue to yellow. The blue water index B-w, defined as negative b*, was similarly high at two offshore monitoring sites in Lake Tahoe, but much lower in a semienclosed bay and a small adjacent lake. Seasonal variations of B-w were determined using a hyperspectral radiometer attached to a buoy in the middle of Lake Tahoe. The B-w values were highest in summer, and there was a strong inverse correlation between B-w and phytoplankton concentrations as measured by in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence. However, there was no significant correlation between B-w and Secchi depth. Blueness and visual clarity are complementary measures of the perceived optical state of natural waters, and for many lakes may provide a powerful combination of indicators for conveying water quality to the public.

Sampling was carried out between one to three times per month from May 2001 to July 2002. Salinity ranged from 14 to 146. The air and water temperature exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, and mean annual temperatures were approximately 4.8A degrees C and 7.3A degrees C, respectively. The lowest water temperature occurred in winter from December to March at -2A degrees C and the highest in June and July at 17.7A degrees C. Forty-one phytoplankton taxa, 21 zooplankton, and 5 benthic or facultative zooplankton were identified. The predominant phytoplankton species were Gloeothece linearis, Oscillatoria tenuis, Gloeocapsa punctata, Ctenocladus circinnatus, Dunaliella salina, and Spirulina major. The predominant zooplankton species included Holophrya actra, Brachionus plicatilis, Daphniopsis tibetana, Cletocamptus dertersi, and Arctodiaptomus salinus. The mean annual total phytoplankton density and biomass for the entire lake were 4.52x10(7) cells/L and 1.60 mg/L, respectively. The annual mean zooplankton abundance was 52, 162, 322, and 57, 144 ind./L, in the three sublakes. The annual mean total zooplankton biomass in Lakes 1-3 was 1.23, 9.98, and 2.13 mg/L, respectively. The annual mean tychoplankton abundances in Bg1, 2, and 3 were 47, 67, and 654 ind./L. The annual mean tychoplankton biomass was 2.36, 0.16, and 2.03 mg/L, respectively. The zooplankton biomass (including tychoplankton) in the lake was 9.11 mg/L. The total number of plankton species in the salt lake was significantly negatively correlated with salinity.

While short-term mesocosm studies have reported temperature- and nutrient-driven effects, long-term observations from natural systems remain limited. We studied seasonal plankton communities in 10 lakes in central Poland, five warmed by power plant discharge for six decades and similar to 2 degrees C warmer (annual mean) than control lakes. Based on environmental DNA (eDNA) relative read abundance, green algae (Chlorophyta) were up to 15% more abundant in heated lakes, while golden algae (Chrysophyceae) were up to 7% more abundant in control lakes. Heated lakes exhibited higher diversity of diatoms, green algae, golden algae, cercozoans, basidiomycetes, and chytrids, especially in summer. Their plankton assemblages were compositionally distinct and showed reduced seasonal variability. Multiple regression revealed that rising temperature, interacting with elevated nutrients, reduced diversity in many plankton groups. Warming favored heat-adapted taxa, driving compositional shifts. By providing insights into the long-term impacts of anthropogenic warming, this study underscores the importance of integrating temperature-nutrient interactions in predicting ecosystem responses to climate change.

J	Hyman, LM; Kobepa, N				Hyman, Larry M.; Kobepa, Niko			On the Analysis of Tone in Mee (Ekari, Ekagi, Kapauku)	OCEANIC LINGUISTICS												In this paper we present the tonal properties of Mee, a Wissel Lakes Papuan language known also as Ekari, Ekagi, and Kapauku. Since the previous accounts in the literature have been highly inadequate, allowing contradictory claims of tone, pitch-accent, and/or stress, we document the word-prosodic system and show that it is quite simple: Mee words can have a pitch drop from H to L either after the first mora or the second mora of the word. Corresponding to this simplicity, however, is a wide range of compatible interpretations. We consider how several analyses fare with respect to noun tone patterns, as well as verb tones, which are partly determined by the verb root, partly by inflectional features. From a typological perspective, the Mee system falls into the same category as Tokyo Japanese, Somali, Western Basque, and Mayo, which have also been subject to differing interpretations.

A study of the quantitative dynamics of the food components in the course of 1 yr proved that the species feeds more intensely in spring, this being the time when zooplankton forms are more abundant in the lake. Plant dentritus, mixed with planktonic and benthic forms, served as additional and alternative food. The lack of clearly positive food component selectivity, and the low values for intestine repletion index and condition coefficient, account for the slowness in growth of T. aurea in Lake Kinneret. The low growth and feeding indices are due to the pressure brought to bear by other local fish species which compete for the same food.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1978	13	1					67	79		10.1016/0044-8486(78)90129-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(78)90129-1													WOS:A1978ER42100006

Bernhart; Renaut, Robin W.; Behrensmeyer, Anna K.; Potts, Richard			Quaternary geochemical stratigraphy of the Kedong-Olorgesailie section of the southern Kenya Rift valley	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This study uses a variety of geochemical parameters to reconstruct a Quaternary environmental history of the Kedong-Olorgesailie sector of the southern Kenya Rift Valley. Lacustrine, wetland and fluvial deposition took place between about 1.9 and 0.72 Ma at Munyu wa Gicheru in the northern part of the study area. Sedimentation continued about 40 km further south to produce the lake, wetland, fluvial and pedogenic deposits of the Olorgesailie Formation between about 1.2 and 0.5 Ma. Faulting subsequently led to basin breakup at Olorgesailie and the development of Middle to Late Pleistocene cut-and-fill fluvial deposits, as well as pond, wetland and terrestrial sediments that were locally altered by pedogenesis. Tufas and calcretes also accumulated during this latter time interval. Sedimentation in these different depositional sequences reflects several long-term trends, including: 1) an increase in carbonate deposition; 2) a decrease in biogenic silica; and 3) decreased chemical weathering indices (Chemical Index of Alteration, Vogt ratios), which imply increasing Quaternary aridity and/or erosion of catchment soils. The biophile elements Br and S also increase upwards, suggesting pulses of erosion of organic soils. Plants permineralized by silica became widespread after about 0.5 Ma, providing evidence that groundwater bodies were becoming silica-enriched, possibly as a result of deeper water circulation along active faults. Several fault-aligned fossil hot spring deposits with siliceous vent, pedogenic and swamp facies have been identified at Emerit in the central part of the Kedong-Olorgesailie rift. Tectonism also provided pathways for meteoric water that led to the formation of carbonate springs in the Olorgesailie area. REE patterns in clastic sediments are stable throughout the Quaternary, reflecting the dominant trachytic source rocks, but these patterns become variable in later Pleistocene calcretes and tufas documenting changing hydrochemical conditions. The geochemical evolution of the area partly reflects climate change through time. However, it also documents the influence of Quaternary rifting processes. Rift faulting affected the geochemistry of the basin sediments by 1) causing changes in the depth of fracture systems that controlled groundwater movements and sourcing of fluids, 2) changing accommodation space in which sediments could accumulate, and 3) altering relief and thus rainfall and evaporation patterns across the rift system, as well as erosion and weathering rates.

Long-term and seasonal nitrate trends illustrate potential prevention of large cyanobacterial biomass by sediment oxidation in Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Several studies have shown that large, experimental additions of nitrate (NO3) to eutrophic systems can mitigate large populations of nuisance cyanobacteria and that high NO3 concentrations can oxidize anoxic sediments. These studies are consistent with observations from numerous aquatic systems across a broad trophic range showing development of reduced surficial sediments precedes the formation of large cyanobacteria populations. We use 50+ years of data to explore whether high NO3 concentrations may have been instrumental both in the absence of large populations of cyanobacteria in eutrophic Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario in the 1970s when total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concen-trations were high, and in delaying large populations until August and September in recent decades despite much lower TP and TN. Our results indicate that large cyanobacteria population events do not occur at the central station in July-September when epilimnetic NO3 > 2.2 mg N L-1. The results further suggest that remedial improvements to wastewater treatment plant oxidation capacity may have been inadvertently responsible for high NO(3 )concentrations > 2.2 mg N L-1 and thus for mitigating large cyanobacteria populations. This also implies that large cyanobacteria populations may form earlier in the summer if NO(3 )concentrations are lowered. (C) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Distributions of crustacean zooplankton, rotifers, phytoplankton, and selected chemical parameters in near-surface waters were determined prior to, during, and following capacity pumping of the station, over a 2-week period. Effects of station operation on species composition or abundance of plankton occurred primarily in the immediate discharge area, affecting a region of approximately 1 km2. Similarly, reduced levels of turbidity and pH, and an increase in concentration of dissolved silica, occurred in the discharge area. These changes were attributed to relocation of cooling water, which was drawn from the hypolimnion and returned to the lake surface.																			0380-1330						1985	11	4					530	539		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71797-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71797-2													WOS:A1985AXC3300012

Measurements were made of the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in thawing soil and runoff waters in the foothills region of the Kuparuk River basin of arctic Alaska, during the thaw of May 1996. Incubations were performed using DOC and soil cores at the time of thaw from the surface layers of two major tundra types of the region, nonacidic and acidic tundra. Results indicated that there are major changes in both the quantity and quality of DOC as soil waters thaw and move to the streams and lakes. DOC concentrations were found to be reduced up to 90% as soil waters thawed and became free-flowing soil waters with leachates from thawed soil cores averaging 116 mg DOC/L at thaw and soil waters averaging 20 mg DOC/L. Stream and inlet to Toolik Lake DOC concentrations averaged 12 and 10 mg DOC/L respectively indicating further dilution of DOC. Quality differences elucidated by XAD-8/4 resin fractionation of DOC were observed for waters at various points in the ecosystem. The hydrophilic neutral fraction (HIN) accounted for 71% of the DOC in waters of thawing soil cores, but was only 23% in flowing waters of soils, and 9-20% in stream waters. A 14 day 4 degrees C incubation of DOC from thawing soil core waters reduced DOC an average of 39%, with 80% of that reduction occurring in the HIN fraction.. Soil waters and stream waters were similar in DOC fraction composition, and fulvic acid fractions were dominant. Initial 14 day DOC respiration rates with high HIN waters were 10 mg CO2-C/g DOC/d, and reduced to 1.2-1.7 mg CO2-C/g DOC/d after 34 days incubation. Respiration rates of thawed cores ranged from 0.12 to 0.06 and 0.03 mg CO2-C/g C/d for nonacidic and acidic cores, respectively.

N.; Scherba, A., V			Biogenic Migration of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Saline Drying Lakes in Crimea	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Migration of nutrients is studied in five drying salt lakes belonging to the Yevpatoriya Group (Crimea). The nutrients enter in the Crimean salt lakes from natural sources, in particular, atmospheric precipitation, erosion materials, seawater overflow during storms, products of vital activity of birds and animals grazing on coasts, processes in ecosystems (eutrophication and vital functions of aquatic organisms). Nitrogen and phosphorus are also supplied with runoff directly in water bodies and indirectly via ground waters, and recreation activity on the lake coasts. An increase of air temperature above +30 degrees C in summer caused intense evaporation and drying up of the lakes. In drying water bodies, the natural processes of the nitrogen and phosphorus migration are terminated due to cessation of biota functioning, especially of microalgae, microbial communities and crustacean Artemia. In drying periods, nitrogen, phosphorus, and pollutants are accumulated and concentrated on the bottom sediments and during strong storms and winds are propagated over adjacent territory and, respectively, represent a threat to human health. The paper discusses the possible scenario of the transformation of ecosystems of saline lakes under possible climatic warming and increasing anthropogenic impact.

J	Zheng, C; Wang, L; Liu, YY; Dong, ZZ				Zheng, Chuang; Wang, Lin; Liu, Yuyun; Dong, Zizhen			Three types of extreme cold events over East Asia and the associated atmospheric circulations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Extreme cold events (ECEs) are typical weather and climate extremes in boreal winter and could significantly influence human health and society. Based on daily data from 1958 to 2024 and the K-means cluster analysis, this study focuses on the ECEs over East Asia and divides their occurrence locations into three types, i.e., the Eastern-Moving Southward (E-MS) type, the Northwestern-Stationary (NW-S) type, and the Southwestern-Climbing (SW-C) type. The intensity and lifetime of the E-MS ECEs rank in the middle of three types of ECEs over East Asia. The cold airmass of E-MS ECEs originates from the Baikal Lake, moves southeastward towards eastern East Asia, and leads to low temperatures over the East Asian coastal regions. The associated atmospheric circulation features the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and a Rossby-wave train resembling the positive phase of the Eurasian (EU) pattern and the negative phase of the East Atlantic/West Russia pattern. The NW-S ECEs are featured by the strongest intensity with the longest lifetime. Their cold airmass is primarily located north of 40 degrees N over the northwestern East Asia with the quasi-stationary cold anomalies induced by the atmospheric blocking over the Ural Mountains. The negative phases of AO, EU, and Scandinavian pattern account for the evolution and change of NW-S ECEs over East Asia. The SW-C ECEs are characterized by the weakest cold intensity and mainly affect the southwestern East Asia. The associated cold airmass presents the evidently eastward-propagating characteristics of climbing the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which can be attributed to a weakly positive phase of AO and the southern branch of the positive EU pattern.					dong, zizhen/IAR-7986-2023														0930-7575	1432-0894				JUL 29	2025	63	8							296	10.1007/s00382-025-07777-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-025-07777-7													WOS:001538761100005

The controls on boreal peatland surface water chemistry in Northern Alberta, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Spatial and temporal variability in surface water chemistry, organic soil chemistry and hydrologic indicators were investigated at three poor-fen complexes in two boreal catchments in Northern Alberta to provide insight into the dominant controls on surface water chemistry. Improved understanding of these controls is required to enable prediction of runoff chemistry in the region under changing atmospheric deposition conditions. Surface water chemistry exhibited considerable variability; within each fen conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Cl(-) tended to decrease and pH tended to increase with increasing distance from the lake edge. Variations in evaporative isotopic enrichment in (2)H and (18)O, expressed as deuterium excess, were used to distinguish between throughflow waters and those that were more evaporatively enriched. Throughflow surface waters were more acidic primarily due to higher concentrations of DOC and NO(3)(-). Exchangeable base saturation and pH of organic soils were strongly related to surface water chemistry at two of the fen complexes, demonstrating the capacity for cation exchange to influence surface water chemistry. Fen surface water concentrations of most elements and DOC increased during the summer period (between June and August), while pH of water decreased. Evaporative concentration of the surface waters was a dominant driver, with surface water temperature increasing at both catchments. Localized groundwater discharge was an important contributor of base cations to the fens, while the organic soils are sinks for atmospherically deposited SO(4)(2-), N and Cl(-).

J	Gulyás, S; Sümegi, P				Gulyas, Sandor; Sumegi, Pal			Late Pleistocene to Holocene Palaeohydrological History of the Thermal-Spring-Fed Lake Pețea (NW Romania) Revealed by Radiocarbon Dating and Complex Sedimentological Investigations	QUATERNARY												Understanding sedimentation processes in response to past hydrogeological and climatic changes and capturing millennial-scale variations is a key focus of lacustrine paleoenvironmental research. This study presents the first high-resolution chronology and sedimentary data for the small thermal-spring-fed Lake Pe?ea, NW Romania, and unravels the evolutionary history of the lake harboring a unique endemic fauna. Its small size and single source of water make it particularly sensitive to hydrological changes. In the recent past, over-exploitation of the thermal water has led to the complete drying up of the lake and the extinction of its fauna. Nevertheless, past spatio-temporal variation of environmental factors, in particular the fluctuation of lake levels and water temperature, must have had a significant impact on the survival and evolution of the endemic mollusk fauna. This fact makes this study particularly important. Based on our results, a three-stage sedimentary evolution occurred, mainly controlled by major climate-driven hydrological changes also seen in regional records, i.e., 17.5-14.5 ka shallow eutrophic lake, 14.5-5.5 ka oligotrophic carbonate-rich lake, and 5.5-0.5 ka shallow eutrophic lake. A major lowstand at 11.7-10.2 ka due to drier climate was followed by progressively rising water levels up to 5 ka followed by a drop. The main control on lake level fluctuations and sedimentary phases was the varying input of thermal water due to recurring increased/decreased recharge of the underground shallow karst water system. The driving factor of thermal water discharge was different during the Late Glacial than the Holocene. It was the warming of the climate at 14.5 ka cal BP and melting of regional ice sheets in addition to increased precipitation that created an oligotrophic lake by recharging the underground thermal water system. Conversely, during the Holocene, increasing/decreasing moisture availability driven by major climate forcings was in control of thermal water recharge, erosion, and fluctuating lake levels.																			2571-550X					JUN	2023	6	2							37	10.3390/quat6020037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat6020037													WOS:001021109000001

Subtelocentric and subtelo-telocentric chromosomes predominated in the sets of snails from both populations. Pericentric inversions were basic factors in the interpopulational differentiation of karyotypes. Intrapopulational karyotype polymorphism (specimens with 2n = 36, 2n = 34, rarely Zn = 35) and mosaic molluscs occurred in the Ullal de Baldovi population as a result of small chromosome elimination. The rather frequent appearance of one or two non-homologue small chromosomes in hypodiploid nuclei 2n = 35, 2n = 34 was obviously connected with fragmentation of chromosomes. Karyological findings are in accordance with phenotypic diversity of M. dufouri from the Ullal de Baldovi population.																			0260-1230	1464-3766				AUG	1998	64		3				309	318		10.1093/mollus/64.3.309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/64.3.309													WOS:000075956700005

A total of 73 different g20 (viral capsid assembly protein genes) amino acid sequences were obtained from this study. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 73 segments were distributed in six major clusters (alpha to zeta), with four unique subclusters, which were identified as KRM-I, KRM-II, KRM-III, and KRM-IV. The cyanophage community in Kranji Reservoir exhibited a large degree of diversity; the clones obtained in this study showed similarities to those from many different environments, including oceans, lakes, bays, and paddy floodwater, as well as clones from paddy field soils. However, the sequences in this study were generally found to be more closely related to the g20 sequences of freshwaters and brackish waters than those from marine environments. The rarefaction curves and Chao 1 indices from this study showed that the diversity of the cyanomyovirus community was greater during the Inter-monsoon periods than the Southwest and Northeast Monsoons. A few seasonal changes in the taxa were observed: (i) Cluster zeta was absent during the Southwest Monsoon, and (ii) most of the samples fell into Group 3 in the PCA score plot during the Northeast Monsoon, and the fraction of Cluster e increased significantly.					; Gin, Karina/AIB-8230-2022	Gin, Karina Yew-Hoong/0000-0002-1266-9276; 													1342-6311						2015	30	1					12	20		10.1264/jsme2.ME14039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1264/jsme2.ME14039								25736864					WOS:000351925200002

We evaluated the WRF-lake model by applying it at a large dimictic reservoir, Miyun Reservoir, in northern China. The results show that the WRF-lake model, though ignoring inflow-outflow, yields good surface water temperature simulation through reasonable parameterization. The Minlake model, as a better physically based model in reservoirs, was used to test the effect of inflow-outflow, including heat carried by inflow-outflow water exchange and water level change on the 1D model's performance. The effect of heat carried by inflow-outflow is mainly in summer, negatively correlated with hydraulic residence time and positively correlated with temperature difference between inflow and outflow. For a reservoir with hydraulic residence time of 3 years and temperature difference between inflow and outflow about 10 degrees C in summer, the heat carried by inflow-outflow is far less than the heat exchange through the surface (<2%) and therefore has little influence on total energy balance. The effect of water level change is mainly on latent heat and sensible heat in unit area, rather than outgoing longwave radiation. Though influencing the temperature in deep layers, the water level change does not have a significant impact on the surface temperature. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of WRF-lake, an important submodule of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system, in the large dimictic reservoir. This is important because WRF-lake does not consider the effect of inflow-outflow and water level change, which are important characteristics of large reservoirs and can affect the heat budget and reservoir-atmosphere interactions. The applicability of WRF-lake in large reservoirs with frequent inflow-outflow and water level change is widely concerned but has never been discussed in previous studies. Our research explored the applicability of WRF-lake in the large dimictic reservoir and discussed the effect of inflow-outflow and water level change quantitively.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				AUG	2022	23	8					1227	1244		10.1175/JHM-D-21-0220.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-21-0220.1													WOS:000848276400002

ARCHIVES DES SCIENCES												Four campaigns were performed during the partial eclipse of sun (August 11, 1999) in order to improve the influence of light on the spatial segregation and the vertical migration of zooplankton. The fall of light intensity has engender a vertical migration of Cyclops prealpinus and Daphnia hyalina which bait an upward movement at the beginning of the eclipse which continues as far as the maximum of this last, then they sink front the end of this phenomenon. Eudiaptomus gracilis, mainly localised in the layer 20-30 m, increased its abundance in the layer 10-20 m at the maximum of the eclipse. E. gracilis begins a short surfacing slower than C. prealpinus and D. hyalina. Influence of light on these migrations would be more important in case of a total eclipse because this phenomenon induces same light conditions than during a nycthemeral cycle.																			0252-9289					DEC	1999	52	3					199	208																WOS:000087093000005

Anticipated increases in inputs of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from catchments in high-altitude lakes could affect planktonic interactions, especially if inputs occur during the winter ablation phase. However, the responses of plankton communities to added DOC interacting with nutrients during this period are still not well understood. We sampled under-ice water and used a multifactorial experimental design to investigate the DOC effect on planktonic organisms (phytoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton [HPP]) and their interactions during the winter ablation phase. The plankton community was subjected to DOC additions (0, 2, 4, and 6 mg C/L) under two nutrient-availability treatments (natural concentrations or enriched in N and P), two light conditions (dark or light), and two temperature conditions (10 or 18celcius). We found HPP to be co-limited by N, P, and C in our microcosms. Added glucose as available C-source for bacterioplankton was highly consumed at the end of the experiments. This consumption was not always related to an increase of the HPP biomass, due to a rising predatory control by ciliates and mixotrophic phytoplankton over bacteria. In dark conditions, the biomasses of both autotrophic and mixotrophic phytoplankton were substantially reduced, and the HPP biomass under DOC and nutrient additions principally depended on the predatory control exerted by ciliates. In light conditions, a diversification of top-down control over bacteria was observed, with the HPP response to DOC and nutrient additions depending on both mixotrophs and ciliates. Moreover, when heterotrophic ciliates and mixotrophs were present together in the experiments, the ciliates replaced the mixotrophs in phagotrophy over bacteria. Our experimental results indicate that DOC inputs can rapidly alter the trophic interactions of the planktonic food web, depending on nutrient limitation in high-altitude lakes. We found decreased commensalistic interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton, but increased competition and predation, after DOC additions. The expected future scenario of global change during the ablation phase is likely to change the balance between heterotrophic and autotrophic processes in planktonic food webs by increasing heterotrophic processes. These changes could have major repercussions on energy transfer from the base to the top of the food chain in high-altitude lakes. Exploring the planktonic response to rapid environmental changes during the ablation phase appears to be crucial in order to determine how vulnerable high-altitude lakes are to future change.					; Cavalli, Laurent/GVS-6751-2022; Misson, Benjamin/Z-6323-2019	DORY, Flavia/0000-0002-5083-0737; Franquet, Evelyne/0000-0002-7779-772X; Tatoni, Thierry/0000-0002-2557-4444; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2021	66	8					1648	1662		10.1111/fwb.13781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13781		JUN 2021											WOS:000662719000001

Winds and tides of Ligeia Mare, with application to the drift of the proposed time TiME (Titan Mare Explorer) capsule	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE					Titan Through Time-A Workshop on Titans Formation, Evolution and Fate	APR 06-08, 2010	MD					We use two independent General Circulation Models (GCMs) to estimate surface winds at Titan's Ligeia Mare (78 degrees N, 250 degrees W), motivated by a proposed mission to land a floating capsule in this similar to 500 km hydrocarbon sea. The models agree on the overall magnitude (similar to 0.5-1 m/s) and seasonal variation (strongest in summer) of windspeeds, but details of seasonal and diurnal variation of windspeed and direction differ somewhat, with the role of surface exchanges being more significant than that of gravitational tides in the atmosphere. We also investigate the tidal dynamics in the sea using a numerical ocean dynamics model: assuming a rigid lithosphere, the tidal amplitude is up to similar to 0.8 m. Tidal currents are overall proportional to the reciprocal of depth-with an assumed central depth of 300 m, the characteristic tidal currents are similar to 1 cm/s, with notable motions being a slosh between Ligeia's eastern and western lobes, and a clockwise flow pattern. We find that a capsule will drift at approximately one tenth of the windspeed, unless measures are adopted to augment the drag areas above or below the waterline. Thus motion of a floating capsule is dominated by the wind, and is likely to be several km per Earth day, a rate that will be readily measured from Earth by radio navigation methods. In some instances, the wind vector rotates diurnally such that the drift trajectory is epicyclic. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From an elevation of similar to 7.5 m 8000 yr ago, relative sea-level rose to a maximum similar to 9 m above present sea-level 6200 yr ago. Since then, sea-level has fallen monotonically until the present, The precision of the new record makes it suitable for constraining the recent history of the ice sheet in that region, using numerical models of glacio-hydro-isostasy. Simplified regional models suggest that the ice-sheet margin has retreated 30-40 km since the last glacial maximum, with 600-700 m of thinning occurring at the present coastline.

Analysis of N2, O2, and Ar in bubbles from Lake Hoare ice shows that, white O2 is approximately 2.4 times supersaturated in the water below the ice, only 11% of the O2 input to this lake is due to biological activity: 89% of the O2 is derived from meltwater inflow. Trapped bubbles in a subliming ice cover provide a natural "fluxmeter" for gas exchange: in Lake Hoare as much as 70% of the total gas loss may occur by advection through the ice cover, including approximately 75% of the N2, approximately 59% of the O2, and approximately 57% of the Ar losses. The remaining gas fractions are removed by respiration at the lower boundary (O2) and by molecular exchange with the atmosphere in the peripheral summer moat around the ice.

Intensified summer monsoon and the urbanization of Indus Civilization in northwest India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Today the desert margins of northwest India are dry and unable to support large populations, but were densely occupied by the populations of the Indus Civilization during the middle to late Holocene. The hydroclimatic conditions under which Indus urbanization took place, which was marked by a period of expanded settlement into the Thar Desert margins, remains poorly understood. We measured the isotopic values (delta O-18 and delta D) of gypsum hydration water in paleolake Karsandi sediments in northern Rajasthan to infer past changes in lake hydrology, which is sensitive to changing amounts of precipitation and evaporation. Our record reveals that relatively wet conditions prevailed at the northern edge of Rajasthan from similar to 5.1 +/- 0.2 ka BP, during the beginning of the agricultural-based Early Harappan phase of the Indus Civilization. Monsoon rainfall intensified further between 5.0 and 4.4 ka BP, during the period when Indus urban centres developed in the western Thar Desert margin and on the plains of Haryana to its north. Drier conditions set in sometime after 4.4 ka BP, and by similar to 3.9 ka BP an eastward shift of populations had occurred. Our findings provide evidence that climate change was associated with both the expansion and contraction of Indus urbanism along the desert margin in northwest India.

Morphological and proteomic analysis of biofilms from the Antarctic archaeon, Halorubrum lacusprofundi	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Biofilms enhance rates of gene exchange, access to specific nutrients, and cell survivability. Haloarchaea in Deep Lake, Antarctica, are characterized by high rates of intergenera gene exchange, metabolic specialization that promotes niche adaptation, and are exposed to high levels of UV-irradiation in summer. Halorubrum lacusprofundi from Deep Lake has previously been reported to form biofilms. Here we defined growth conditions that promoted the formation of biofilms and used microscopy and enzymatic digestion of extracellular material to characterize biofilm structures. Extracellular DNA was found to be critical to biofilms, with cell surface proteins and quorum sensing also implicated in biofilm formation. Quantitative proteomics was used to define pathways and cellular processes involved in forming biofilms; these included enhanced purine synthesis and specific cell surface proteins involved in DNA metabolism; post-translational modification of cell surface proteins; specific pathways of carbon metabolism involving acetyl-CoA; and specific responses to oxidative stress. The study provides a new level of understanding about the molecular mechanisms involved in biofilm formation of this important member of the Deep Lake community.					; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/D-4341-2013; BURNS, BRENDAN/B-5093-2009; YE, JUN/B-1801-2018	Charlesworth, James/0000-0001-9018-0436; BURNS, BRENDAN/0000-0002-2962-2597; Williams, Timothy/0000-0002-2738-3019; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/0000-0001-8989-6402; /0000-0002-8492-2648; Poljak, Anne/0000-0001-9953-1984; YE, JUN/0000-0002-6476-6406													2045-2322					NOV 22	2016	6								37454	10.1038/srep37454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep37454								27874045					WOS:000388231600001

This condition persisted until October, when deep mixing of the water column occurred. Carbon and phosphate assimilation were by similar size classes, and as the ratio of two rate processes, PDI was independent of both temperature and biomass. Turnover time and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) correlated with PDI. Short-term photosynthetic depression with phosphate enrichment occurred in only 7 of 23 experiments and may either reflect P-sufficient conditions or high protein to carbohydrate ratios due to physical events common to large lakes. PDI, protein to carbohydrate ratios, and photosynthetic depression respond principally to algal activity. Although turnover time and APA reflect the activity of smaller microorganisms, primarily heterotrophic bacteria, all indices were consistent.

Organic analysis (%TOC, %TN, C/N ratios and delta C-13 values) of a sediment sequence from Lake Shudu, Yunnan Province (ca. 22.6-10.5 cal ka BP) indicates generally low aquatic palaeoproductivity rates over millennial timescales in response to cold, dry climatic conditions. However, the record is punctuated by two marked phases of increased aquatic productivity from ca. 17.7 to 17.1 cal ka BP and from ca. 11.9 to 10.5 cal ka BP.

For example, migratory water birds are believed to suffer from competition with resident fish populations for shared food resources. While observational evidence in support of this hypothesis is accumulating, replicated experiments addressing this issue at the proper spatial scale are lacking. Here, we report from a replicated whole-system experiment in which we stocked large (0.07 km(2)), shallow (<= 2.5 m deep), highly eutrophic ponds in the bird protection area "Ismaninger Speichersee mit Fischteichen'' with different densities of carp and assessed the responses of water birds and their food resources during summer over several years. In all years, the biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and macrophytes as well as the densities of herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous water birds were reduced in carp ponds compared to fishshless ponds. The negative effects of carp on food resources and on the numbers of water birds feeding in carp ponds increased over the season (May-September) and were stronger at high than at low stocking densities of carp. Consequently, differences in resource densities between ponds with and without carp increased, and the ranking of ponds with respect to resource densities became more predictable over the season. These factors may have contributed to a seasonal improvement of the birds' abilities to track resource densities across ponds, as suggested by tight correlations of bird numbers on ponds with resource densities late, but not early, in the season.

J	Yu, SM; Liu, JS; Xu, JQ; Wang, H				Yu, Shumei; Liu, Jingshi; Xu, Jianqing; Wang, Hong			Evaporation and energy balance estimates over a large inland lake in the Tibet-Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The process of evaporation from the lake surface is one of the main mechanisms in the energy and water budgets of the lake hydrologic cycle, and an essential component of the water balance especially for inland lakes. In this study, using routine meteorological data as input, a one-layer potential evaporation model was employed to simulate evaporation and energy fluxes over Lake Yamdrok Yumco, the largest high-elevation inland lake in the mountain area of the Tibet-Himalaya in China. Then, the calculation results were compared with the measured values from a big pan evaporator of 20 m(2) near the lake. The results show that the average annual input radiation flux R-down arrow is 128.2 W m(-2), the lake storage heat flux G is 19.4 W m(-2), the sensible heat flux H is 20.4 W m(-2) and the latent heat flux lE is 107.8 W m(-2). The R-down arrow and G exhibit similar seasonal variations. The lE reaches a maximum in October, lagging nearly 4 months behind the R-down arrow and the G, which indicates the large heat capacity of the lake. The simulated annual evaporation ranges from 1,113.2 to 1,429.1 mm and its mean value is 1,252.5 mm during 1961-2005. The simulated annual evaporation is in good agreement with the measured value, and the measured average lake temperature is as expected when compared with the measured lake surface temperature.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2011	64	4					1169	1176		10.1007/s12665-011-0933-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-0933-z													WOS:000295845600022

Middle to late Holocene initiation of the annual flood pulse in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, possesses one of the most productive inland fisheries in the world and is a vital natural resource for the country. The lake is connected to the Mekong River via the Tonle Sap River. Flow in the Tonle Sap River reverses seasonally, with water exiting the lake in the dry season and entering the lake during the summer monsoon. This flood pulse drives the lake's biological productivity. We used Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes and elemental concentrations in lake sediment cores to track changes in the provenance of deposits in Tonle Sap Lake. We sought to determine when the lake first began to receive water and sediment input via the Mekong River, which initiated flood pulse processes. The transition from a non-pulsing lake to the Mekong-connected system is marked by shifts to values of Sr-87/Sr-86, epsilon(Nd), and Pb-207/Pb-204 that are characteristic of Mekong River sediments. In addition, magnetic susceptibility increased and sediment elemental composition changed. Elemental (P) measures point to enhanced phosphorus loading and C/N and isotope ratios of bulk organic matter indicate a shift to greater relative contribution of organic material from aquatic versus terrestrial environments, coinciding with the initiation of flood pulse processes. On the basis of radiocarbon dating in two cores, we estimate the initiation of the annual flood pulse occurred between similar to 4,450 and 3,910 cal year BP.					; Kamenov, George/AAE-6176-2020	Hodell, David/0000-0001-8537-1588; Kenney, William/0000-0002-2273-8263; Guilderson, Thomas/0000-0001-9371-7059; Kamenov, George/0000-0002-6041-6687; Brenner, Mark/0000-0001-9837-012X													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2011	45	1					85	99		10.1007/s10933-010-9482-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9482-9													WOS:000285931000007

It has been hypothesized that this can be explained by latitudinal differences in the structure of the trophic cascade. Many tropical fish species reproduce throughout the year and are omnivorous. Both properties could reduce the chances for large zooplankton to cause a clear-water phase. Continuous reproduction leads to permanent presence of planktivorous young individuals, and thus a continuously high predation pressure on large zooplankton. on the other hand, omnivory could allow fish to be more abundant, leading to a higher predation pressure on zooplankton. Data to distinguish between effects of continuous reproduction and omnivory boosted abundance are scarce. Here, we use a simple model to indicate that continuous fish reproduction in the tropics by itself can reduce the chances for top-down control of phytoplankton by Daphnia even if the carrying capacity for small fish would not be boosted by omnivory. The model predicts that only at very low fish densities, clear-water phases are possible, but these tend to occur at irregular times of the year. We also analyzed the effect of change in the mean annual temperature. This model analysis suggests that in temperate regions where fish reproduction is pulsed, climatic warming would tend to promote the chances for top-down induced clear-water phases.

Sinkhole risk assessment by ERT: The case study of Sirino Lake (Basilicata, Italy)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The presence of natural or artificial lakes and reservoirs that can drain because of natural phenomena can generate catastrophic events affecting urban and agricultural areas next to the source area. Therefore, geophysical prospecting techniques have been applied in the study of Sirino Lake, which, during the last century, was affected by the sudden opening of small sinkholes, resulting in the almost total draining of the lake and in the sudden increase of water flow rates of distal springs. Two electrical resistivity tomographies (ERTs) were carried out across the lake, using electrode arrays located on land and across the water body. Self-potential (SP) data were acquired around the lake shore and the surrounding area. The geophysical prospecting contributed significant data toward explaining the unique hydrogeological characteristics of the lake. Integration of geophysical, geological, hydrogeological, and geomorphological data allowed us to estimate the thickness of the lacustrine deposits beneath the lake, to describe the main patterns of the subsurface fluid flows in the area, and to identify possible water escape routes causing the piping phenomena.

The relation between runoff and climate change are always the core of scientific hydrological study in arid region. This paper presents a multi-variate time series controlled auto-regressive (CAR) model based on hydrological and climatic data of typical tributaries Jinghe River in Ebinur Lake Basin of Xinjiang covering the period from 1957 to 2012. The aim is to study the climate change and its effects on runoff of the Jinghe River, Northwest China. The results showed the following: the runoff of the Jinghe River was unevenly distributed and has obvious seasonal changes throughout the year. It was concentrated in summer and has along dry season with less runoff. The monthly maximum river runoff was from June to September and accounted for 74% of annual runoff. The river runoff increased since the 1980s till the 1990s; in the 21st century there was a trend of decreasing. The oscillatory period of annual runoff series in the Jinghe River Basin was 21a and 13a, and these periods were more obvious, followed by 32a and 9a. The oscillation with a time scale of 21a and 13a was a full timed domain. The MRE is 6.54%, the MAE is 0.84 x 10(8) m(3), and the RMSE is 0.039. The CAR model passed the F-test and residual test, and the change trend of calculated and measured values of annual runoff is consistence, which means that the model was reasonable.

J	Devineni, N; Sankarasubramanian, A; Ghosh, S				Devineni, Naresh; Sankarasubramanian, A.; Ghosh, Sujit			Multimodel ensembles of streamflow forecasts: Role of predictor state in developing optimal combinations	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A new approach for developing multimodel streamflow forecasts is presented. The methodology combines streamflow forecasts from individual models by evaluating their skill, represented by rank probability score (RPS), contingent on the predictor state. Using average RPS estimated over the chosen neighbors in the predictor state space, the methodology assigns higher weights for a model that has better predictability under similar predictor conditions. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithm by developing multimodel streamflow forecasts for Falls Lake Reservoir in the Neuse River Basin, North Carolina (NC), by combining streamflow forecasts developed from two low-dimensional statistical models that use sea-surface temperature conditions as underlying predictors. To evaluate the proposed scheme thoroughly, we consider a total of seven multimodels that include existing multimodel combination techniques such as combining based on long-term predictability of individual models and by simple pooling of ensembles. Detailed nonparametric hypothesis tests comparing the performance of seven multimodels with two individual models show that the reduced RPS from multimodel forecasts developed using the proposed algorithm is statistically significant from the RPSs of individual models and from the RPSs of existing multimodel techniques. The study also shows that adding climatological ensembles improves the multimodel performance resulting in reduced average RPS. Contingency analyses on categorical (tercile) forecasts show that the proposed multimodel combination technique reduces average Brier score and total number of false alarms, resulting in improved reliability of forecasts. However, adding multiple models with climatology also increases the number of missed targets ( in comparison to individual models' forecasts) which primarily results from the reduction of increased resolution that is exhibited in the individual models' forecasts under various forecast probabilities.

Horizontal distributions showed clear avoidance of the shoreline, which might be explained by the lower density of predators (Chaoborus sp. and Notonecta sp.) in the central parts of the lake. In early summer all size classes of D. longispina exhibited upward nocturnal vertical migration, descending to the upper hypolimnion in daytime. Later in summer, when the nocturnally migrating Chaoborus sp. had grown large enough to graze on small Daphnia, the latter seemed to shift towards twilight migration. However, large Daphnia individuals showed no synchronized migration; rather their bimodal vertical distributions suggested asynchronous vertical migration. Large individuals showed a particular tendency to concentrate near to the oxycline, close to the dense phytoplankton and bacteria populations in the upper part of the anoxic hypolimnion. According to vertical trap experiments, large D. longispina visited the anoxic hypolimnion and might harvest its abundant food resources. The high haemoglobin content of large individuals seems a specific adaptation to allow access to low oxygen water and hence to maximize grazing potential, in both epi- and hypolimnion, and minimize predation pressure. By staying predominantly in cooler water near the oxycline, Daphnia might also minimize its energy consumption to adjust to low food availability while sustaining a sufficiently high population density to exploit those unpredictable short periods with abundant food which are common in small headwater lakes. It is suggested that migrations of zooplankton are a complex behavioural adaptation which may not be explained by any single factor. In humic lakes with shallow stratification, vertical migrations seem to offer particularly high potential advantages, because of the short distances between dramatically different environments in the water column. In further studies more emphasis should be placed on migrations of individuals rather than populations, and migrations should be considered as a dynamic part of the structure and function of the whole planktonic ecosystem.																			0018-8158					FEB 21	1992	229						271	288		10.1007/BF00007005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007005													WOS:A1992HL35400020
J	ROWE, DK				ROWE, DK			VERTICAL SEGREGATION AND SEASONAL-CHANGES IN FISH DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS BETWEEN LAKES OF CONTRASTING TROPHIC STATUS	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												High frequency (200 kHz) echosounding was used to determine vertical structuring and seasonal changes in the depth distributions of limnetic fish in three New Zealand lakes. Juvenile (F.L. 30-50 mm) and large-sized (F.L. 50-80 mm) smelt Retropinna retropinna were segregated into discrete layers by depth in all three lakes throughout the year. Larval and post-larval bullies Gobiomorphus cotidianus (F.L. 8-20 mm) formed a further layer between the layers of small and large-sized smelt. Although the depths of the large-sized smelt and bully layers changed on a seasonal basis, vertical segregation between the three layers of fish persisted throughout the year, even when the lakes were homothermal. Seasonal movements of fish were disrupted by the autumnal deoxygenation of the hypolimnion in Lake Rotoiti. The schools of large-sized smelt were forced to ascend towards the layer of bullies, but segregation between these smelt and the bullies was maintained as the smelt occupied a much reduced depth range above the hypolimnion, and just below the bullies. The winter descent of bullies, which precedes their transition to a benthic existence failed to occur in Lake Rotoiti, even though the lake was fully mixed at this time.																			0022-1112					NOV	1994	45	5					787	800																WOS:A1994PR49400007

New results from the ca. 1.1 Ga Midcontinent Rift System of North America extend their record into wholly terrestrial depositional settings, including capping paleosols, paludal environments, and alluvial sedimentary units. The MISS are present on both sides of present-day Lake Superior, at Good Harbor Bay, Minnesota, and at Copper Harbor, Michigan, indicating a regionally widespread biosphere. MISS in the Midcontinent Rift System include abraded Kinneyia, pustulose mound structures, multidirectional wave ripples, textured bedding plane surfaces, and stromatolites. Organic carbon is also preserved in MISS from both sides of the rift, and in finely laminated sedimentary strata, indicating that the biosphere extended also into the hinterland. Independent climatic evidence indicates a temperate setting; thus. the new MISS extend both the depositional and environmental niches where MISS are preserved.

The Pliocene sediments contain many soft-sediment deformation structures, mainly located at the marginal sites of Guadix-Baza paleo-lake. This area is characterised by sandy, silty and clayey sediments with rare gravel horizons. The soft-sediment deformation structures include: load casts, pillows and water-escape structures, all indicative of sediment liquefaction or fluidization. An evaluation of these structures suggest that storm waves, overloading and artesian spring action can be rejected as possible genetic mechanism. Regional considerations favour tectonic activity during the Pliocene in this sector of the Betic Cordillera as the cause of the soft-sediment deformation structures in the Guadix-Baza basin, i.e. moderate-high magnitude seismic shocks.

Hatching began immediately after spring thaw and was terminated by rising salinity 10 days to 2 wk later. Growth rates reached maxima of 1 mm/day at 4 wk of age and then declined as mean size approached 22-23 mm at 7-8 wk. Clutch sizes varied as a function of female length. Maximum biomass of 580 mg dry wt/m2 (2700 cal/m2) was reached in late May, of which 3.9%/day was consumed by B. gigas. Source of the energy is presumed to be a bacteria-organic matter complex associated with suspended particles. Life cycle details are compared with other fairy shrimp species and the role of B. mackini in the community is discussed.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1977	55	1					161	168		10.1139/z77-020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z77-020													WOS:A1977CU59400020

Ocean Modification and Seasonality in a Northern Ellesmere Island Glacial Fjord Prior to Ice Shelf Breakup: Milne Fiord	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Understanding the impact of the break-up of northern Ellesmere Island ice shelves on fjord dynamics is limited by a lack of ocean observations prior to ice loss. Based on profiling and mooring data collected between 2011 and 2019, we describe the oceanography of Milne Fiord prior to the 2020 breakup of the Milne Ice Shelf, including, sources of ambient water, under-ice hydrography, glacial modification, and seasonality. Ambient waters originate in the Canada Basin but are modified by interaction with the 100 m thick ice shelf at the fjord entrance, and extensive glacier tongue at the head. Properties within the 436 m deep fjord are depth-dependent, with freshwater surface runoff and subglacial discharge accumulating in the upper 50 m of the fjord each summer behind the ice shelf. Freshwater export is restricted to a basal channel in the ice shelf, resulting in the fjord being more stratified and warmer than waters offshore year-round. Below the ice shelf and above a 260 m deep sill unrestricted exchange allows warm Atlantic Water to penetrate to the 150 m deep glacier grounding line where submarine melting occurs. Basal meltwater spreads down-fjord close to its depth of origin due to the strong stratification. Interannual warming of fjord deepwater is likely driven by shoaling of the Arctic Ocean thermocline and spillover at the sill, highlighting the link between fjord properties and regional oceanography. Further breakup of the ice shelf is predicted to substantially alter fjord dynamics, with consequences for ocean forcing of the Milne Glacier.

Industrial and municipal wastewaters are released without proper purification only 2 km upstream from the Krka National Park (KNP) in Croatia. The variability of dissolved metal(loid)s was studied in four seasons and eight locations: Krka River source (reference site, KRS), municipal wastewaters from the Town of Knin (KRK), industrial wastewaters from the screw factory (IWW), Brljan Lake in the KNP (KBL), and the tributaries Krcic (TKR), Kosovcica (TKO), Orasnica (TOR) and Butisnica (TBU). Water taken directly from IWW had several times higher concentrations of all elements than other locations and indicated industrial wastewater as the primary Mn, Zn, Co, Cs, and Fe source. Tributary Orasnica, flowing by IWW, was the most affected site, although higher metal concentrations were also found at other locations compared to KRS. Overall, spatial metal contamination followed the order: TOR>KRK>TKO>TBU>KBL>KRS. Seasonality was not pronounced, although the highest levels for most metals were observed in summer, dry season when the self purification processes are reduced. Almost all elements had low tendency to bind with particles, therefore showing high presence in dissolved fraction and confirming their bioavailability and potential toxicity. Although metal concentrations increased over time, they were still low compared to metal-contaminated rivers. However, observed metal exposure and inter-site differences present a warning and indicate the need for the targeted continuous monitoring of potential hotspots to protect this karst ecosystem. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

A dynamic-bioenergetics model to assess depth selection and reproductive growth by lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush)	OECOLOGIA												We coupled dynamic optimization and bioenergetics models to assess the assumption that lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) depth distribution is structured by temperature, food availability, and predation risk to maximize reproductive mass by autumn spawning. Because the model uses empirical daily thermal-depth profiles recorded in a small boreal shield lake (lake 373 at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario) during 2 years of contrasting thermal stratification patterns, we also assessed how climate-mediated changes in lakes may affect the vertical distribution, growth, and fitness of lake trout, a cold-water top predator. The depths of acoustic-tagged lake trout were recorded concurrently with thermal-depth profiles and were compared to model output, enabling an assessment of model performance in relation to the observed fish behavior and contrasting thermal conditions. The depths and temperatures occupied by simulated fish most closely resembled those of the tagged fish when risk of predation was included in the model, indicating the model may incorporate the most important underlying mechanisms that determine lake trout depth. Annual differences suggest less use of shallow (warm), productive habitats, resulting in markedly less reproductive mass, during the year with the warm stratification pattern. Mass for reproduction may be lower in warmer conditions because of reduced reproductive investment, yet survival may be inadvertently higher because risky surface waters may be avoided more often in warmer, shallower, and metabolically costly conditions. At a minimum our study suggests that lake trout reproductive mass and fitness may be expected to change under the anticipated longer and warmer stratification patterns.

We investigated the persistence and variability of the response of Peter Lake to liming by collecting all available historical data on the lakes and by monitoring the limnological properties of both lakes weekly from June-August, 1984. Physical and chemical changes in limed Peter Lake included increases in pH, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, transparency, oxygen content and summer heat content. These changes occurred rapidly in 1951 and have persisted with little variability until 1984. Several differences in algal and zooplankton community composition and dynamics were associated with the physical and chemical changes. Historical data and our observations indicate that the planktonic community structure of Peter Lake has been more variable than that of unlimed Paul Lake.

Transitions zones, such as the southern fringe of the boreal region in northern Mongolia, are expected to experience drastic changes as a result. This area is dry and cold with forests forming only on the north-facing slopes of hills and grasslands distributing on the south-facing slopes, making it difficult for continuous forests to exist. However, in the Hovsgol Lake Basin, there is a vast continuous pure forest of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica). In other words, the lake water thawing/freezing process may have created a unique climatic environment that differs with the climate of the adjacent Darhad Basin, where no lake exists. Thus, in order to compare the effect of the thawing/freezing dynamics of lake water and the active layer on the thermal regime at each basin, respectively, temperatures were simultaneously measured. The Darhad Basin has similar latitude, topography, area, and elevation conditions. As expected, the presence of the lake affected the annual temperature amplitude, as it was 60% of that in the Darhad Basin. The difference in the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles of the lake and the active layer caused a significant difference in the thermal regime, especially in winter.																				2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	18							2785	10.3390/w14182785	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182785													WOS:000857536200001

Models continue to have difficulty in replicating ozone behavior in the region. Although emissions and chemistry may play a role in model performance, the complex meteorological setting of the relatively cold lake in the summer ozone season and the ability of the physical model to replicate this environment may contribute to air quality modeling errors. In this paper, several aspects of the physical atmosphere that may affect air quality, along with potential paths to improve the physical simulations, are broadly examined. The first topic is the consistent overwater overprediction of ozone. Although overwater measurements are scarce, special boat and ferry ozone measurements over the last 15 years have indicated consistent overprediction by models. The roles of model mixing and lake surface temperatures are examined in terms of changing stability over the lake. From an analysis of a 2009 case, it is tentatively concluded that excessive mixing in the meteorological model may lead to an underestimate of mixing in offline chemical models when different boundary layer mixing schemes are used. This is because the stable boundary layer shear, which is removed by mixing in the meteorological model, can no longer produce mixing when mixing is rediagnosed in the offline chemistry model. Second, air temperature has an important role in directly affecting chemistry and emissions. Land-water temperature contrasts are critical to lake and land breezes, which have an impact on mixing and transport. Here, satellite-derived skin temperatures are employed as a path to improve model temperature performance. It is concluded that land surface schemes that adjust moisture based on surface energetics are important in reducing temperature errors.

Fossil diversity and abundance, especially for Charophytes and gastropods with the absence of palygorskite, dolomite and evaporites, suggest the presence of a fresh water lake changing to a brackish environment at certain time intervals. A lake or possibly several smaller and shallower lakes occupied an area of about 50 km wide within the Azraq Basin. The present-day and climate cannot support the presence of lakes in the eastern desert of Jordan, and thus MIS 9 in Jordan must have been much wetter.

Although evidence from loess and lake records in the Chinese sand-loess belt has shown the role of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) in duststorm activities, these records can't clearly divide the intensity grades and shifts in material components nor explain the mechanism. This study used grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio analyses, along with the grain size end-member (EM) model, fractal dimension (Dv), and MS-based paleo-precipitation reconstruction to clarify these aspects. Four grain size end-members (EMs) revealed that fine grains were predominantly derived from westerly wind and pedogenesis, while the EAWM primarily transported coarse grains. We classified aeolian activity intensity into three grades based on changes in the proportion of sand, which were the main signs of intense wind erosion in the LHG profile located in the southeastern margin of the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL). Since 150 ka, there have been three major episodes of sand expansion and three fixed or shrinking intervals. It was mostly a sand environment, except during the early L1F phase when it became a typical desert environment with mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 164.49 mm. Desert/sand evolution was constrained by moisture, vegetation, and wind field conditions. These factors were driven jointly by solar insolation and ice sheet dynamics, and synchronized recorded glacial-interglacial and millennial-scale oscillations. The findings help improve our knowledge of regional ecological environment changes and aeolian disaster monitoring and prevention.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT	2025	462								117524	10.1016/j.geoderma.2025.117524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2025.117524													WOS:001585526300003
J	Nghiem, SV; Leshkevich, GA				Nghiem, Son V.; Leshkevich, George A.			Satellite SAR remote sensing of Great Lakes ice cover, part 1. Ice backscatter signatures at C band	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												For remote sensing of Great Lakes ice cover, afield experiment campaign was conducted in the 1997 winter season across the Straits of Mackinac and Lake Superior. The campaign was coordinated in two expeditions on two different United States Coast Guard icebreaker vessels, the Biscayne Bay in February and the Mackinaw in March. Aboard these icebreakers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory C-band polarimetric scatterometer was used to measure backscatter signatures of various ice types and open water at incidence angles from 0 degrees to 60 degrees. The radar measurements include incidence angles and polalrizations of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) on ERS, RADARSAT, and Envisat satellites. The radar data together with in situ measurements form a signature library that can be used to interpret SAR data for ice classification and mapping. Results are presented for backscatter signatures of Great Lakes ice types from thin lake ice to thick brash ice with different snow-cover and surface conditions. The signature library indicates that several ice types can be identified with multi-polarization SAR data; however, single-polarization data can result in misclassification of ice and open water at different ranges of incidence angle and wind conditions. For incidence angles larger than 30 degrees, thick brash ice, the most difficult for icebreaking operations and the most hazardous for ship navigation, can be uniquely identified by co-polarized backscatter for all wind conditions below the gale force.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					722	735		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[722:SSRSOG]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[722:SSRSOG]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500002

We explored the seasonal and vertical distribution of viruses and its relative influence on prokaryotic carbon metabolism in a hypereutrophic reservoir, Lake Villerest (France). Flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses to determine viral abundance (VA; range = 6.1-63.5 x 10(7) ml(-1)) and viral infection rates of prokaryotes (range = 5.3-32%) respectively suggested that both the parameters varied more significantly with depths than with seasons. Prokaryotic growth efficiency (PGE, considered as a proxy of prokaryotic carbon metabolism) calculated from prokaryotic production and respiration measurements (PGE = prokaryotic production/[prokaryotic production + prokaryotic respiration] x 100) varied from 14 to 80% across seasons and depths. Viruses through selective lyses had antagonistic impacts on PGE by regulating key prokaryotic metabolic processes (i.e., production and respiration). Higher viral lysis accompanied by higher respiration rates and lower PGE in the summer (mean = 22.9 +/- 10.3%) than other seasons (mean = 59.1 +/- 18.6%), led to significant loss of carbon through bacterial-viral loop and shifted the reservoir system to net heterotrophy. Our data therefore suggests that the putative adverse impact of viruses on the growth efficiency of the prokaryotic community can have strong implications on nutrient flux patterns and on the overall ecosystem metabolism in anthropogenic dominated aquatic systems such as Lake Villerest.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													1664-302X					FEB 9	2016	7								81	10.3389/fmicb.2016.00081	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00081								26903963					WOS:000369840000001

Periods of high acidity and heavy metals content during the summer were coincident with heavy mortality of brook trout from a hardwater hatchery and a softwater hatchery; trout from a second hardwater hatchery, which contained zinc in its water supply, survived transfer to Honnedaga Lake. Chemical analyses of 30 nearby Adirondack lakes revealed two lakes of lower salinity, two of higher acidity, and one with a heavy metals content equal to that of Honnedaga. No other lakes exhibited the combined features of very low salinity, high acidity, and relatively high heavy metals content.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1965	94	3					227	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[227:WQIRTS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[227:WQIRTS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19656983600005

Previous studies have revealed that diapause can contribute to coexistence of competing genotypes or species in fluctuating environments via the storage effect. However, they tended to focus on differences in reproductive success (e.g. seed yield) and diapause termination (e.g. germination) timing. Here we tested whether different photoperiodic responses in diapause induction can promote coexistence of two parthenogenetic (asexual) genotypes of Daphnia pulex in Lake Fukami-ike, Japan. Through laboratory experiments, we confirmed that short day length and low food availability induced the production of diapausing eggs. Furthermore, we found that one genotype tended to produce diapausing eggs in broader environmental conditions than the other. Terminating parthenogenetic reproduction earlier decreases total clonal production, but the early diapausing genotype becomes advantageous by assuring reproduction in 'short' years where winter arrival is earlier than usual. Empirically parameterized theoretical analyses suggested that different photoperiodic responses can promote coexistence via the storage effect with fluctuations of the growing season length. Therefore, timing of diapause induction may be as important as diapause termination timing for promoting the maintenance of genetic diversity in fluctuating environments.

Here we use multi-core and multi-proxy records from a peatland near Darbin Lake in the Arxan region of Northeast China-near the southernmost limit of circum-Arctic permafrost and the northern limit of East Asian summer monsoon influence-to document peatland development and carbon accumulation histories and their responses to past climate changes during the last 2500 years. Our macrofossil results show that the peatland was characterized by a sedge-dominated fen from 500 BCE to 1450 CE, changed to a Sphagnum-dominated poor fen or bog with abundant shrubs between 1450 and 1960 CE, and finally became predominated by Sphagnum mosses after 1960 CE. The time-weighted mean apparent carbon accumulation rates from three cores ranged from 19.5 to 53.0 g C m- 2 yr- 1 with a mean value of 32.4 g C m- 2 yr- 1, but increased rapidly to 139.2 g C m- 2 yr- 1 during the last several decades. During the early stage of the peatland development, three coring sites that are only 50 m apart were all in the fen phase but they had highly variable bulk densities. The fen-bog transition at these locations occurred during the Little Ice Age but at different times owing to the various influences of local hydrology, permafrost dynamics, or fire disturbance. These observations suggest that fens are highly heterogeneous, not only in peat properties but also in ecosystem dynamics. The dramatic increases in apparent carbon accumulation rates during the late stage of the bog phase after 1960 CE cannot be entirely explained by the limited decomposition of recently accumulated young peat. Instead, our analysis suggests that this was likely due to the increasing Sphagnum dominance and low decom-position of Sphagnum-derived litter, supporting the notion of the important role of vegetation changes in con-trolling carbon accumulation rates of peatlands. Around the 1990s CE, an increase in allogenic carbon accumulation rate-after removing the effect of age-related long-term autogenic decay of peat-coincides with a period of increased regional summer precipitation, suggesting the high sensitivity of continental ombrotrophic bog ecosystems to hydroclimate changes at decadal timescales.

Fill and Merge Dynamics	WETLANDS												Intermittent surface connectivity can influence aquatic systems, since chemical and biotic movements are often associated with water flow. Although often referred to as fill and spill, wetlands also fill and merge. We examined the effects of these connection types on water levels, ion concentrations, and biotic communities of eight prairie pothole wetlands between 1979 and 2015. Fill and spill caused pulsed surface water connections that were limited to periods following spring snow melt. In contrast, two wetlands connected through fill and merge experienced a nearly continuous, 20-year surface water connection and had completely coincident water levels. Fill and spill led to minimal convergence in dissolved ions and macroinvertebrate composition, while these constituents converged under fill and merge. The primary factor determining differences in response was duration of the surface water connection between wetland pairs. Our findings suggest that investigations into the effects of intermittent surface water connections should not consider these connections generically, but need to address the specific types of connections. In particular, fill and spill promotes external water exports while fill and merge favors internal storage. The behaviors of such intermittent connections will likely be accentuated under a future with more frequent and severe climate extremes.

J	Seppä, H; Hammarlund, D				Seppä, H; Hammarlund, D			Pollen-stratigraphical evidence of Holocene hydrological change in northern Fennoscandia supported by independent isotopic data	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Pollen records from 21 sites were used to reconstruct Holocene hydrological changes in northern Fennoscandia. The inferred dominance of maritime-type Betula-forests from c. 9600 BP onwards indicate an oceanic climate in the region during the early Holocene, with high amounts of precipitation and low seasonal contrasts. This interpretation is supported by oxygen isotope records obtained on lacustrine carbonates from Abisko, northern Sweden. Enrichment of O-18 during the early Holocene suggests enhanced zonal circulation and a pronounced influence of Atlantic air-masses in northern Sweden. The pattern of Pinus expansion in the area was time-transgressive, ranging from 9200-8000 BP in the extreme north-east to 7900-5500 BP in the western and south-western parts of the region. The replacement of Betula-forests by Pinus-forests indicates a climatic change towards drier summers and increased seasonality. At Abisko, a close correlation between regional Pinus expansion and depletion of (1)8O in lacustrine carbonates suggests that the expansion of Pinus was triggered by a gradual attenuation of the influence of westerlies. Thus, in large-scale palaeohydrological terms, the early expansion of Pinus in the north-easternmost parts of Fennoscandia as compared to the successively later expansion in the west and south-west may reflect a gradually decreasing influence of Atlantic air-masses in northern Fennoscandia during the early and mid Holocene.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008	Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; 													0921-2728					JUN	2000	24	1					69	79		10.1023/A:1008169800682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008169800682													WOS:000087175000006
J	GACIA, E; BALLESTEROS, E				GACIA, E; BALLESTEROS, E			PRODUCTION OF ISOETES-LACUSTRIS IN A PYRENEAN LAKE - SEASONALITY AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE GROWING PERIOD	AQUATIC BOTANY												A leaf marking method was applied for the measurement in situ of the primary production of Isoetes lacustris L., supplemented by the description of the leaf growing pattern. Leaf production in this species in Lake Baciver was highly seasonal with maximum values in July (0.36 g cm-2 day-1 at 0.8 m and 0.93 g C m-2 day-1 at 2.3 m depth) and no winter production. Total annual production ranged from 75 g dry weight (DW) m-2 year-1 in the shallow water population (0.8 m) to 2 26 g DW m-2 year-1 in the deep water population (2.3 m). The increase in production.with depth appeared to depend directly on plant biomass. The low water temperatures and extremely reduced light levels prevented leaf production in Isoetes lacustris from mid November to early May. In June, production per irradiance unit was very low, which could be related to growth limitation by temperature, as shown by light and temperature response experiments. In situ fertilization of the sediment and a decrease in nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in tissues during the growing period showed that growth of this species in the lake is nutrient limited. The mean annual C:N:P (molar) ratio 525:26:1 suggests a strong phosphorus limitation for Isoetes lacustris in Lake Baciver.

Snowmelt and iceout did not result in episodes of low pH and alkalinity in the 3 high lakes sampled. The minimum pH was 5.8 and neither pH nor alkalinity showed a seasonal trend following iceout, although specific conductance did decrease slightly. The lack of an acidification episode was not surprising because the pH of snow from a site near the studied lakes averaged 5.3. The snow was richer in cations than had been reported earlier in precipitation from the Cascades, even though sulfate concentrations were similar. Chemical stratification was apparent in the surface 20 m layer of the lower elevation lake; the upper 50 m of the highest elevation lake was similar in alkalinity content to that observed in snow. The intermediate elevation lake showed a slight tendency to stratify in the upper 50 m. These observations suggest that snowmelt water does not mix with the whole lake volume in these deep lakes with relatively low watershed:lake surface area ratios and low flushing rates as might be expected in lakes with more extreme characteristics.																			0029-344X	2161-9859					1984	58	2					85	93																WOS:A1984TW36200001

Seasonal Comparison of Catch Rates and Size Structure Using Three Gear Types to Sample Sturgeon in the Middle Mississippi River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the efficacy of three gears commonly used to sample shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, pallid sturgeon S. albus, and lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in large rivers. We stratified habitats and randomly sampled sites with trawls, gill nets, and trotlines, in the middle Mississippi River from June 2003 through May 2005 (N = 3,476 samples). A total of 3,523 shovelnose sturgeon, 31 pallid sturgeon, and 13 lake sturgeon were captured. When sample sizes were adequate (based on power analysis), we used a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA), procedure to determine the relative impact of season and gear type on sturgeon catch per unit effort (CPUE). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to determine whether the length frequency distributions for each species differed among gears. Overall, the power analyses indicated that there were adequate sample sizes for comparing standardized CPUE for shovelnose sturgeon among seasons; however, too few pallid or lake sturgeon were collected to make statistical comparisons. Shovelnose sturgeon catch rates varied among gears and seasons: season and gear type interacted in the ANOVA model. Among gear types, 5.08-cm gill nets produced the highest standardized CPUE, and catch rates were highest during spring. The length frequency distributions of shovelnose sturgeon depended on gear type. Shovelnose sturgeon can be sampled in large rivers using stratified random sampling with this combination of gear. However, pallid sturgeon and lake sturgeon may be too rare to sample with this approach.

Physiological acclimation of Pinus flexilis to drought stress on contrasting slope aspects in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Photosynthetic gas-exchange characteristics were measured in Pinus flexilis James (limber pine) during two drought years in a xeric, subalpine ecosystem of the Rocky Mountains. Limber pine exhibited conservative water-use traits, including low specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen, stomatal conductance, transpiration (E), and light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)), but exhibited high needle longevity, water-use efficiency (A(max)/E), and stable carbon isotope composition. Net photosynthesis declined strongly with leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, resulting in a bimodal seasonal pattern of A(max). Although very little gas exchange was observed in late summer, photosynthetic activity extended into October. The avoidance of gas exchange during high atmospheric demand maximized whole-season water-use efficiency. Leaf temperature and leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit were higher on south-facing slopes during both moderate (2006) and severe (2007) drought. Severe drought caused lower stomatal conductance and E on the southeast-facing slope, but neither A(max) nor canopy reflectance indices differed among slope aspects. Although A(max) was lower in 2007 than 2006, branch-length increment did not differ. Foliar stable carbon isotope composition was higher in needles produced in dry years but did not vary among slope aspects. These results indicate that physiological acclimation to water stress prevented among-aspect differences in A(max) and that shoulder-season photosynthesis may become increasingly important in a warmer climate.					; Letts, Matthew/F-9528-2010	Letts, Matthew/0000-0001-8336-6267; 													0045-5067	1208-6037				MAR	2009	39	3					629	641		10.1139/X08-206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X08-206													WOS:000265285800014

From individual design to clusters?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Citizen science projects spring up in freshwater monitoring, with an increasing number of projects in river, lake, and groundwater monitoring around the globe. Citizen science scholars assume that these projects have different designs, including diverse characteristics of citizens, institutions, and forms of interactions, potentially affecting the outcomes of these projects. Given the strong focus on case studies or reviews in the field, there is, however, little comparative evidence of the different types of citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring. Based on a global survey, this study provides a systematic comparative analysis of the design of 85 citizen science projects in the field of freshwater monitoring. Descriptive statistics reveal how projects differ along 45 literature-based design variables raised in the survey. Factor analysis based on 31 of these variables yields ten key design factors, and cluster analysis, based on these design factors, allows to identify seven distinguished clusters of citizen science projects. While these clusters are rather heterogeneous, they reveal differences between groups of projects regarding institutional motivation, citizen characteristics, and interaction forms. These results significantly add to a systematic comparison of citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring and enable a more effective involvement of citizens in environmental management.					; Loghmani Khouzani, Seyed Taha/HKM-7449-2023; Nath, Shuvojit/HZK-7589-2023	Bennett, Christy/0000-0003-3006-7196; Loghmani Khouzani, Seyed Taha/0000-0001-6877-6671; Kirschke, Sabrina/0000-0003-1036-3756; Nath, Shuvojit/0000-0002-0021-1575													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 1	2022	309								114714	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114714		FEB 2022						35189514					WOS:000820967200004

In 1999, however, another Daphnia species suddenly appeared in the lake. Based on morphological characteristics, the species was initially identified as Daphnia pulicaria. This identification was supported by mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequences of the 12S rRNA and NADH-5 (ND5) genes. In addition, comparison of the latter sequences showed that D. pulicaria in Lake Biwa is genetically very similar to populations distributed across the western regions of North America rather than those in other regions, including Europe. Thus, it is likely that D. pulicaria in Lake Biwa is a zooplankton invader from North America. Through routine sampling, we first detected D. pulicaria in winter 1999. This species gradually increased in abundance and reached a maximum density of 10000 individuals m(-2) in mid-May 1999. Thereafter, it decreased in abundance and almost disappeared from the water column after August 1999. D. pulicaria are much larger than D. galeata and are distributed in deeper water. They showed a marked diel vertical migration, although substantial numbers of individuals stayed above and within the thermocline, both during the day and at night. Based on seasonal and vertical distributions, we discuss the ecological implications of the sudden appearance of D. pulicaria in Lake Biwa.

Marking Power Lines to Reduce Avian Collisions Near the Audubon National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Overhead power lines can pose collision risks to birds. Risks may be mitigated through marking lines with high-visibility devices, but the effectiveness of line marking remains unclear. Effectiveness is particularly poorly described for lines bisecting open water, where detection of carcasses can be difficult. We marked 3 of 9 spans (lines between adjacent structures) along a causeway crossing open water and 2 adjacent spans over lake shores between Lake Sakakawea and Lake Audubon near Audubon National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota, USA. Over 3 years, we found 1,186 avian carcasses, including 276 attributed to power-line collision. American coots (Fulica americana; n = 83) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus; n = 27) were the species most commonly associated with power-line collision, but we also found carcasses of 51 other species, including a piping plover (Charadrius melodus; n = 1). Multivariable modeling indicated line marking over open water reduced predicted collisions per span per season (mid-April through mid-October, 2006-2008) from 10.3 to 5.8. Birds with high-aspect-ratio wings benefitted most from line marking (e.g., shorebirds and gulls). If the 9 open-water spans we studied were unmarked for 30 years, we predicted 2,775 collisions. We predicted only 1,560 collisions if all of these spans were marked. Our data demonstrate that a wide variety of avian species are at risk of collision with lines bisecting open water, marking lines can reduce collision risk, and because collisions persisted and some line markers fell off power lines, improvements to effectively mark lines are needed.

J	CARTER, HR; SEALY, SG				CARTER, HR; SEALY, SG			YEAR-ROUND USE OF COASTAL LAKES BY MARBLED MURRELETS	CONDOR												Sixty-seven records (from 1909 to 1984) of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) using 33 freshwater lakes along the west coast of North America (78.6% in British Columbia [Canada], 12.1% in Alaska, 6.1% in Washington, and 3.0% in Oregon [USA]) were compiled and analyzed. The preponderance of records from southern British Columbia lakes possibly reflects the abundance of coastal lakes there that are accessible to high numbers of murrelets and observers. Fifty-three of the lake-use records were obtained during the species'' breeding season (April through September); 13 were from the nonbreeding season (October to March). Most lakes used were within 20 km of the ocean, but a few murrelets were reported at lakes 50 to 75 km inland (Cultus, Harrison, and Swan Lakes, British Columbia). The multiple records of Marbled Murrelets using Cultus and Harrison Lakes suggest that these lakes are near nesting areas, and as such, are the farthest distances inland Marbled Murrelets can be expected to nest. Five or less individuals usually were reported in each record, although up to 46 were seen in summer on Nitinat Lake, Vancouver Island. Feeding occurred on some lakes in British Columbia, apparently mainly at night: the stomachs of four murrelets contained fingerling sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), while another stomach contained the remains of salmon fry.																				1938-5129				NOV	1986	88	4					473	477		10.2307/1368273	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1368273													WOS:A1986F097900008

Components of Mortality within a Black Bass High-Release Recreational Fishery	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Mortality after release can have a substantial impact on high-release recreational sport fishes, such as Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. However, little work has explored the cumulative impact of catch-and-release mortality at the population level. We used a combined telemetry-tag return approach to estimate all components of total mortality, including instantaneous natural mortality ( M) and instantaneous fishing mortality ( F), for Florida Largemouth Bass M. salmoides floridanus ( hereafter, Florida Bass) within a popular fishing lake in northern Florida. Fishing mortality was subdivided into harvest ( F-H), recreational catch-and-release ( F-R), and tournament catch-and-release ( F-T) components. Over 2 years, we monitored the fates of 181 Florida Bass that were tagged with high-reward external dart tags and internal radio transmitters. An additional 345 fish were tagged with variable-reward external tags. Annual F-H values were seasonal, with an increase in F-H occurring in the spring of both years; F-H ranged from 0.17 ( SD = 0.04) in the first year to 0.60 ( SD = 0.09) in the second year. Estimated mean F-T ranged from 0.04 to 0.07, and mean F-R ranged from 0.03 to 0.05. Estimates of M were also seasonal, with annual M ranging from 0.29 ( SD = 0.06) to 0.46 ( SD = 0.09), and were within the expected range relative to other published estimates. Our results showed that although the total catch-and-release mortality ( F-R plus F-T) was low in comparison with the high rates of harvest ( F-H) for this Florida Bass fishery, it still made up 21% of total F. Our method combining passive tagging and telemetry tagging allowed for the estimation of all mortality sources, which can be important for high-release recreational fisheries in which harvest is not the only source of mortality.					; Hightower, Joseph/O-5867-2019	Hightower, Joseph/0000-0001-7208-7764; 													0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	3					578	588		10.1080/00028487.2015.1131742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1131742													WOS:000379058600011
J	CAMPBELL, DH; TURK, JT; SPAHR, NE				CAMPBELL, DH; TURK, JT; SPAHR, NE			RESPONSE OF NED WILSON LAKE WATERSHED, COLORADO, TO CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF SULFATE	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Ned Wilson Lake watershed responds directly and rapidly to changes in precipitation inputs of sulfate, which has important implications for effects of acid deposition on the aquatic system. Chemistry at three precipitation collection sites and three watershed sites (a pond, a lake, and a spring) has been monitored in and near the Flattops Wilderness Area in northwestern Colorado beginning in 1981-1983. Bulk snowpack concentration of sulfate in the watershed and volume-weighted annual mean concentration of sulfate in precipitation at two nearby sites generally decreased from 1981 to 1985, were small through 1987, and increased in 1988-1989. Changes in concentration of sulfate at the watershed sites are controlled by precipitation inputs. Responsiveness of the individual sites was dependent on their position along the hydrologic flow path. The fastest response was in the pond, which has a hydrologic residence time of less than 1 year; over 90% of the variance in concentration of sulfate in the pond was explained by changes in concentration in precipitation. The lake has a hydrologic residence time of 1 to 4 years; a regression model of the concentration of sulfate in the lake, as a function of the concentration in the lake during the previous year and the concentration in precipitation, explained 87% of the variance in concentration of sulfate in the lake. The hydrologic response time of the spring is unknown; it was not responsive to changes in concentration of sulfate in precipitation. The recent increase of sulfate concentration in precipitation and in the pond and lake is evidence for a rapid rather than a delayed response, which could not be determined when only a decreasing trend in sulfate concentration was reported in 1982-1987. Watersheds of this type are sensitive to acidification (acid-neutralizing capacity less than 60-mu-eq L-1), and these results indicate conservative behavior of sulfate. This is important in predicting effects of future changes in atmospheric deposition, which could potentially be caused by anthropogenic emissions or climatic change.																			0043-1397					AUG	1991	27	8					2047	2060		10.1029/91WR01189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91WR01189													WOS:A1991FZ85600025

The diverse imported organic matter, coupled with sedimentary heterogeneity and intricate microbial processes, gives rise to seasonal variations in methane emissions from reservoirs. In this study, sediment cores were supplemented with terrestrial or autochthonous carbon to emulate reservoir carbon input across different seasons, thereby investigating methane emission potential and associated microbial mechanisms within the sediment cores. Results demonstrated that autochthonous organic matter enhanced sediment organic content, thereby providing more substrates for the methanogenic process and fostering the proliferation of methanogens (with a relative abundance of 47.17 % to 60.66 %). Notably, the dominant genera of Methanosaeta, Methanosarcina, and Candidatus Methanomethylicus were boost on the surface layer of sediment. Concurrently, the introduction of autochthonous organic carbon spurred an increase in methane-oxidizing microbe, reaching up to 5.59 %, with Methylobacter and Candidatus Methanoperedens as the predominant species, which led to a downward migration of the functional microbial group in the sediment. Under the priming impact of autochthonous carbon, however, the methane oxidation probably doesn't consume the substantial methane produced in sediment. Consequently, the sediment functions as a hotspot for methane release into the overlying water, highlighting the necessity to include summer as critical periods for integrated assessments, particularly during algae bloom.

P., EAM intensity peaks between 8.6 and 7.7 ky B. P., and then gradually decrease in response to summer insolation, heat and moisture transport. Our proxy record reveals several weak monsoon intervals that correlate to low sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific and cold events in the North Atlantic, linking the tropical Pacific, North Atlantic, and Polar climates because weak EAM events at similar to 8.2, 5.4 and 4.5-2.1 ky B. P. also correspond to low values of atmospheric methane and periods of reduced North Atlantic Deep Water formation. We therefore suggest that centennial to millennial scale monsoon variability during the Holocene in the northern subtropics is globally-mediated via a sun-ocean-monsoon-North Atlantic linkage.

Results are reported for total P, total Kjeldahl N, NO3--N, NH4+-N, total N, Fe, H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42- and CL- for 2 yr (Aug. 1976-July 1978). On an equivalent basis the dominant anion in both bulk and wet precipitation was SO42-, with H+ the dominant cation. Precipitation in the study area was more acidic than that analyzed at any other location on the Canadian Shield. Concentrations of ions varied by 1-3 orders of magnitude between individual precipitation events, and annual deposition varied by as much as 2-fold in the 2 yr. Annual wet deposition contributed > 60% of bulk deposition for all substances except total P. Seasonal trends in deposition with summer maxima were noted for most ions. For Harp Lake, a small Precambrian Lake with a lake area of 12.6% of its total drainage area, precipitation input directly to the lake surface was an important source of nutrients and major ions. This was especially the case for P, N and H+ because these substances were retained by the terrestrial drainage basin.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1979	12	2					171	185		10.1007/BF01047121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01047121													WOS:A1979HW35400005

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Maggiore has reached a stable oligotrophic status after a recovery process from mesotrophy that began in the early 1980s. However, the most recent phytoplankton and water chemistry data seem to indicate that various changes are taking place, including a slight increase in TP values, and almost regular blooms have occurred since 2005. Meteoclimatic data collected over the last few decades in the Lake Maggiore watershed highlight an increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events. Here, for the period 2000-2013, we analyse the relationships between the phytoplankton dynamics and selected extreme precipitation events, in order to evaluate the possible role of rainfall in affecting the nutrient availability and phytoplankton dynamics. Among the algal groups, cyanobacteria showed the strongest relationship with the precipitation pattern, particularly on a short-term temporal scale. Our results support the hypothesis that rainfall may lead to a short-term increase in nutrients that stimulate the growth of phytoplankton and the development of blooms in summer, when epilimnetic waters are usually nutrient depleted. The almost regular cyanobacterial blooms recorded in Lake Maggiore since 2005 can be interpreted as a response to changing precipitation patterns and therefore as a sign of climate-induced eutrophication.

Some researchers have argued that oxygen supply and demand play a crucial role in these processes, but many studies conflated the effects of oxygen and temperature. We studied the body sizes of rotifers (Keratella cochlearis) at different depths in 20 European lakes, taking advantage of gradients in oxygen and temperature during summer, when dense, cool waters sink to low depths and become hypoxic. Rotifers were larger in colder waters, but only in the presence of abundant oxygen. In hypoxic waters, rotifers remained small regardless of temperature. We propose that oxygen supply generates a ceiling for maximal possible body size, especially in environments that elevate metabolic demands. Under this condition, any of several processes-developmental plasticity, genetic divergence, size-dependent mortality, or size-dependent selection of microhabitats-could cause a wider range of body sizes in more oxygenated waters, where the maximal possible size exceeds the adaptive size at any temperature.

Fifty-six species were recorded. Rotifers, were most abundant during late fall. Overall, densities ranged from 4 to 5975 ind. L-1, with mean densities of 1627 +/- 233 ind. L-1 at Zhongda and 1051 +/- 147 ind. L-1 at Huangpu. There was a positive correlation between rotifer density and chlorophyll a concentration at both sites. At Huangpu, rotifer abundance was significantly negatively correlated with salinity. Analysis of partial correlations suggested that the fluvial hydrodynamics and the physico-chemical characteristics of the river affected chlorophyll and the development of rotifer populations was determined by chlorophyll in the lower reaches of Pearl River. The results also show that rotifer density estimates are significantly affected by sampling method.

The study was carried out mainly during two winter seasons (i.e. under-ice conditions) in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994. The mean length of pikeperch in the catches was 38 cm (range 22-51 cm, S.D. = 4.6) and the mean weight 490 g (range 70-1 440 g, S.D. = 190). In the mesh size range of 30-45 mm, a 5 mm increase caused the modal length of the pikeperch catch to rise by 3-5 cm, while in the sparser mesh sizes such an increase caused the modal length to rise by 1-2 cm Any given mesh size captured fish mainly within a length range of 10-15 cm The effects of twine thickness on the catchability of gillnets was significant: the thinner twine caught on average 1.9 times as many pikeperch as the thicker twine. The size composition of the catches was the same for both twine thickness. A large proportion of the fish in the experimental catches were undersized. However, the twine thickness did not effect the proportion of undersized individuals.																			0003-455X						1996	33	3-4					621	625																WOS:A1996WB44500039

Here we present the first multi-proxy palaeoecological study from the treeline in the Northwestern Swiss Alps that covers the entire Holocene. We reconstructed climate, fire and vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee, an alpine lake at 2,065 m a.s.l., by using seismic sedimentary surveys, loss on ignition, visible spectrum reflectance spectroscopy, pollen, spore, macrofossil and charcoal analyses. Afforestation with Larix decidua and tree Betula (probably B. pendula) started at similar to 9,800 cal. b.p., more than 1,000 years later than at similar elevations in the Central and Southern Alps, indicating cooler temperatures and/or a high seasonality. Highest biomass production and forest position of similar to 2,100-2,300 m a.s.l. are inferred during the Holocene Thermal Maximum from 7,000 to 5,000 cal. b.p. With the onset of pastoralism and transhumance at 6,800-6,500 cal. b.p., human impact became an important factor in the vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee. This early evidence of pastoralism is documented by the presence of grazing indicators (pollen, spores), as well as a wealth of archaeological finds at the nearby mountain pass of Schnidejoch. Human and fire impact during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages led to the establishment of pastures and facilitated the expansion of Picea abies and Alnus viridis. We expect that in mountain areas with land abandonment, the treeline will react quickly to future climate warming by shifting to higher elevations, causing drastic changes in species distribution and composition as well as severe biodiversity losses.

The latter forms part of the plate boundary between the African and Arabian plates along which intensive tectonic and volcanic activity occurred and where a range of freshwater to hypersaline water bodies percolate. The atmosphere-normalized He-3/He-4 ratios (R/R-a) show a distinct geographic gradient, whereby fluids in the north part of the DST, near Lake Kinneret, are characterized by R/R-a approximate to 2. These values decrease gradually southward until the Arava Valley, where they are approximately 0.15, reflecting a corresponding decrease in the mantle-derived He fraction, from about similar to 30% in the north, to a few percent in the south. Freshwater springs outside the DST, in the Galilee and Judea Mountains, are characterized by R/R-a ratios close to unity, reflecting the dominance of atmosphere-derived helium, although they still contain a few percent of a mantle component. The spatial pattern of change in R/R-a ratios is independent of regional tectonic activity (rifting), which is similar around the Lake Kinneret basin and the Dead Sea, and a correlation does not exist between such activity and He concentrations and CO2/He-3 ratios. In contrast, helium concentrations, and to a lesser extent CO2/He ratios, correlate with temperatures of the sampled fluids, reflecting a dilution process of a deep, hot mantle component as it percolates upwards toward the surface. The preferential injection of a mantle He toward the surface in the north DST is facilitated by deep faults and a shallower Moho boundary, which are also associated with enhanced volcanism in the north DST, and is superimposed over a regionally scaled mantle background value. Regionally, the observations reflect a transition from a domination of a dilute mantle end member in the north, which itself is the product of a mixture between mantle and crustal helium, to a dominant crustal (radiogenic) end member in the south. The R/R-a ratio in basaltic olivines and diopside from the Golan is on average 6.6 +/- 0.7, lower than typical mantle values (similar to 8) but corresponding to comparable sub-continental mantle compositions.

Our results showed that gallery forest and lacustrine sediment were observed from 8645 until 3360 cal yr BP. After a change from a lacustrine to a swamp environment at 1700 cal yr BP, the Cerrados and the Mauritia swamp became installed 1000 years ago on our study site. The environmental changes we observed over the last 8600 years in the Ginebra record reinforce the evidence of a west-east climatic gradient with the persistence of rain forest throughout the Holocene on the western side and the presence of the Cerrados until the late Holocene on the eastern side. Moreover, the persistence of a wet forest in the early to mid-Holocene in southwestern Amazonia highlighted some local responses to the global trend that could be related to the distance from the Andes; while in the late Holocene, both an increase in insolation and strengthening of the South American summer monsoon system enabled the installation of a seasonal flooded savanna in northern Beni and of the rain forest in eastern Beni.

Remote sensing allows indirect observation of permafrost, a subsurface phenomenon, by mapping surface features or measuring physical parameters that can be used for permafrost modeling. We have explored high temporal resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence for the period between August 2012 and September 2013 to assess their potential for detecting major seasonal changes to the land surface in a variety of tundra environments within the Lena River Delta, Siberia. The TerraSAR-X signal is believed to be strongly affected by the vegetation layer, and its viability for the retrieval of soil moisture, for example, is therefore limited. In our study individual events, such as rain and snow showers, that occurred at the time of TerraSAR-X acquisition, or a refrozen crust on the snowpack during the spring melt were detected based on back scatter intensity signatures. The interferometric coherence showed marked variability; the snow cover onset and snow melt periods were identified by significant reduction in coherence. Principal component analysis provided a good spatial overview of the essential information contained in backscatter and coherence time series and revealed latent relationships between both time series and the surface temperature. The results of these investigations suggest that although X-band SAR has limitations with respect to monitoring seasonal land surface changes in permafrost areas, high-resolution time series of TerraSAR-X backscatter and coherence can provide new insights into environmental conditions.

Primary production varied with light climate both within and between days. During the 2 diurnal studies when the lake was stratified, small flagellates which constituted 60% of the biomass exhibited significant increases in the mornings and significant decreases in the afternoons. The P/B [production per mean biomass] quotients on these days were high and grazing, sedimentation, respiration and excretion could not account for the difference between assimilated C and change in biomass. On the other 3 occasions the cell numbers were fairly constant, the P/B quotients lower and all of the assimilated C could be accounted for by the above given loss factors. It is argued that cell division usually causes cell mortality and a mechanism for this is discussed.																			0003-9136						1984	100	2					219	233																WOS:A1984SS17800006

Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, populations within the northern expanse of their range in Manitoba, Canada, may be susceptible to high temperature stress and pathogenic infection. We acclimated developing lake sturgeon for 22 days to two ecologically relevant, summer temperatures (16 and 20 & DEG;C). Individuals from both acclimation treatments were then exposed to 0, 30 and 60 & mu;g ml-1 bacterial lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins), as an immune stimulus, for 48 h and sampled 4 and 48 h during trial exposures and following a 7 day recovery period. We then measured whole-body transcriptional (mRNA) responses involved in the innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses following acute exposure to the bacterial endotoxins. Data revealed that overall levels of mRNA transcript abundance were higher in 20 & DEG;C-reared sturgeon under control conditions. However, following exposure to a bacterial stimulus, lake sturgeon acclimated to 16 & DEG;C produced a more robust and persistent transcriptional response with higher mRNA transcript abundance across innate immune, stress and fatty acid responses than their 20 & DEG;C-acclimated counterparts. Additional whole-animal performance metrics (critical thermal maximum, metabolic rate, cortisol concentration and whole -body and mucosal lysozyme activity) demonstrated acclimation -specific responses, indicating compromised metabolic, stress and enzymatic capacity following the initiation of immune-related responses. Our study showed that acclimation to 20 & DEG;C during early development impaired the immune capacity of developing lake sturgeon as well as the activation of molecular pathways involved in the immune, stress and fatty acid responses. The present study highlights the effects of ecologically relevant, chronic thermal stress on seasonal pathogen susceptibility in this endangered species.

Biological scientists have used GPS satellite telemetry to determine the habitat of wild birds. However, because there is not an efficient method to process the location data sets, scientists have to devote themselves to calculating the scattering location points in the GIS and using MCP or Kernel method to find the approximate home range of bird specks. This paper presents an alternative hierarchy clustering-based methodology to build a Spatial-Tree for discovering the habitat area that overcomes the limit of human observation ability. Preliminary results showed that some nodes of the Spatial-Tree correspond to core range area providing an illusive map to depict the breeding and wintering home range of Bar-headed Goose.

In this study, the phylogeny and genetic diversity of the g23 gene in the paddy floodwater samples collected from five sampling sites at three sampling times during the rice (Oryzasativa L.) growth season in Northeast China are reported. In total, 104 different g23 clones were isolated, among which 50% of the clones exhibited the highest identities with the clones retrieved in paddy soils and upland black soils. The remaining clones had the highest identities with lake origins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 43% of the g23 clones grouped into three novel subgroups which included the clones unique to paddy floodwater, and no g23 sequences obtained in paddy floodwater fell into the paddy soil groups II, III, IV, V, VI, VII and NPC-A. UniFrac analysis of g23 clone assemblages demonstrated that T4-type phage communities in paddy floodwater were changed spatially and temporally, and the communities were different from those in paddy soils. Further comparison of the g23 clone assemblages from different environments demonstrated that T4-type phages were biogeographically distributed, and the distribution was both affected by geographical separation and ecological processes across the biomes.

However, labor-intensive sampling and gas analysis have confined evaluations of temporal variability in lakes to the seasonal time scale. We used a state-of-the-art laser-based N2O analyzer combined with a floating chamber to examine the subdaily variations in N2O emissions from a shallow eutrophic lake in Japan. We conducted intense daytime field campaigns during different seasons to reveal differences in these emissions in conjunction with the dynamics of dissolved N2O concentrations in the lake water. The study revealed that N2O fluxes varied within a day; emissions increased in response to increases in wind speed. Variations in surface dissolved N2O concentrations caused by water mixing were also important during summer, when under stably stratified conditions, accumulation of N2O initially occurred in the lake bottom water layer. In addition, in a shallow lake, the N2O production/consumption balance may vary substantially within a day because of a change in dissolved oxygen concentration, which affects dissolved N2O concentration and, in turn, atmospheric emissions. These findings demonstrate the need to consider diurnal variability to accurately estimate cumulative N2O emissions over long periods.

Deformation of an Elastic Beam on a Winkler Foundation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME												We present a simple model for geophysical systems involving sources of deformation, such as magmatic intrusions, subglacial lakes, and the subsurface storage of CO2. We consider the idealized system of a uniform elastic layer overlying a localized region of constant pressure that is surrounded by a Winkler foundation composed of springs. We investigate the effect of source depth and foundation stiffness on the resulting displacement profiles at both the surface and the level of the source. The system is characterized by three key features: the maximum uplift, the maximum subsidence, and the distance to the point of zero displacement. For each of these, we determine asymptotic scaling behavior in the limits of a thin/thick layer and a soft/stiff foundation and form composite curves that allow specific parameter values to be determined from field data. Both two-dimensional and axisymmetric pressure patches are considered, and in the thin-layer limit we derive analytical solutions.					; Neufeld, Jerome/A-2387-2016; Meyer, Colin/AAC-9138-2019	Meyer, Colin/0000-0002-1209-1881; 													0021-8936	1528-9036				MAY	2020	87	5							051010	10.1115/1.4046197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.4046197													WOS:000525408500010

Source regions contributing to excess reactive nitrogen deposition in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) of the United States	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Research has shown that excess reactive nitrogen (N-r) deposition in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) of the United States has passed critical load (CL) thresholds and is adversely affecting sensitive ecosystems in this area. To better understand the sources causing excess N-r deposition, the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), using Western Air Quality Study (WAQS) emission and meteorology inputs, was used to simulate N-r deposition in the GYA. CAMx's Particulate Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) was employed to estimate contributions from agriculture (AG), oil and gas (OG), fire (Fire), and other (Other) source sectors from 27 regions, including the model boundary conditions (BCs) to the simulated N-r for 2011. The BCs were outside the conterminous United States and thought to represent international anthropogenic and natural contributions. Emissions from the AG and Other source sectors are predominantly from reduced N and oxidized N compounds, respectively. The model evaluation revealed a systematic underestimation in ammonia (NH3) concentrations by 65% and overestimation in nitric acid concentrations by 108 %. The measured inorganic N wet deposition at National Trends Network sites in the GYA was overestimated by 31 %-49 %, due at least partially to an overestimation of precipitation. These uncertainties appear to result in an overestimation of distant source regions including California and BCs and an underestimation of closer agricultural source regions including the Snake River valley. Due to these large uncertainties, the relative contributions from the modeled sources and their general patterns are the most reliable results. Source apportionment results showed that the AG sector was the single largest contributor to the GYA total N-r deposition, contributing 34% on an annual basis. A total of 74% of the AG contributions originated from the Idaho Snake River valley, with Wyoming, California, and northern Utah contributing another 7 %, 5 %, and 4 %, respectively. Contributions from the OG sector were small at about 1% over the GYA, except in the southern Wind River Mountain Range during winter where they accounted for more than 10 %, with 46% of these contributions coming from OG activities in Wyoming. Wild and prescribed fires contributed 18% of the total N-r deposition, with fires within the GYA having the highest impact. The Other source category was the largest winter contributor (44 %) with high contributions from California, Wyoming, and northern Utah.

Traditional fishing activities enhance the abundance of selected waterbird species in a wetland in India	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: Waterbirds are globally declining as a result of habitat loss, alteration or degradation. Fishing activities may affect waterbird distribution, abundance and diversity, and traditional fishing activities often enhance waterbird abundance. We tested this hypothesis by studying the abundance and diversity of selected common waterbird species in the Kadalundi-Vallikkunnu Community Reserve, a globally significant wetland in southwestern India in relation to fishing activities. Methods: We monitored waterbird abundance four times a month from 2012 to 2015 using direct observation method during low tide. Traditional bamboo fish traps were deployed during the first and third weeks of each month. ANOVAs (one-way and multi-way) were used to examine how waterbird counts diversity varied in relation to years, seasons and period of fishing traps. Additionally we conducted a linear regression to examine the relationship between fish occurrence and waterbird counts and diversity. Results: Waterbird counts varied with years and seasons, with the maximum counts being recorded during the post-monsoon (winter). Individual species varied in their responses to trap deployment. Small waterbird species usually forage in shallow shorelines, increased during trap deployment whereas the larger waterbirds were not affected by trap deployment because they tend to hunt in deeper waters. The total fish captured was an important predictor of both waterbird abundance and diversity. Conclusion: In this study we documented a positive association between traditional fish trap deployment and waterbird counts and diversity. Providing high quality habitats for waterbirds as well as effective sustainable livelihoods through traditional fisheries is a critical management issue.					; Muzaffar, Sabir/AAP-7176-2020; KM, Aarif/AAU-4077-2021	Muzaffar, Sabir/0000-0001-9195-1677; Puthanpurayil Kandambeth, Prasadan/0000-0001-7228-8435; KM, Aarif/0000-0002-4467-2058; 													2053-7166					JUN 30	2017	8								16	10.1186/s40657-017-0073-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-017-0073-6													WOS:000405209100002

Eruption-triggered mixing of extra-caldera basalt and rhyolite complexes along the East Gallatin-Washburn fault zone, Yellowstone National Park, WY, USA	LITHOS												Though mixing and commingling of magmas is common, mixing between rhyolite and basalt magmas is not commonly preserved in volcanic rocks. The presence of at least four mixed magma complexes at Yellowstone National Park suggests that mingling is not due to random intersections of feeder dikes, geochemical analyses also show that though these magmas appear to be commingled, there is mixing between the two disparate end members. Our model combines previous work on the Grizzly Lake, Gardner River, Crystal Spring, and Appolinaris Spring mixed magma complexes with results from new analyses, recent mixing experiments, and regional structural geology. Coeval extensional tectonism, as seen in the East Gallatin-Washburn fault zone, is also present in other areas of basalt and rhyolite mixing/mingling (e.g. Iceland). The central portions, or core, of the complexes contain increased concentrations of emulsion rock, occasional basaltic pillows in a rhyolite matrix, net veining, and mixed magma with highly variable geochemistry (SiO2 ranges from 50 to 78 wt.%). Phenocrysts have been transferred between mafic and felsic portions of the complexes and suggest that these mixed magmas did not have enough time, or energy (e.g. heat), to thoroughly mix into complete hybrid intermediate magmas. This implies that mixing occurred during eruption. Furthermore, analyses at the micron-scale suggest that zones of chaotic mixing between basalt and high-silica rhyolites may be more complete than previously thought during mixing of high silica rhyolites and basalts with greater than 4 wt.% MgO. The temperature of the rhyolitic magmas was approximately 850 degrees C with a viscosity between 1 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(6) Pas. The basalt was approximately 1070 degrees C with a viscosity of 2 x 10(2) to 9 x 10(3) Pas prior to mixing. Mixing of these two extreme end members may have required decompression of the lower basaltic magma chamber during eruption of the overlying rhyolitic magma chamber into through structurally weakened zones of the upper crust. The decompression induced mixing was facilitated by coeval extensional tectonics and structures in the Norris-Mammoth Corridor. Extra-caldera rhyolites are some of the first volcanics following the collapse of the current caldera and also some of the youngest volcanics in the Yellowstone Plateau and require further understanding of volcanism in the Yellowstone Plateau.

J	Hall, CJ; Burns, CW				Hall, CJ; Burns, CW			Effects of temperature and salinity on the survival and egg production of Gladioferens pectinatus Brady (Copepodas: Calanoida)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The calanoid copepod Gladioferens pectinatus Brady occurs in Lake Waihola, New Zealand, a shallow, tidally-influenced lake. This lake experiences daily and seasonal fluctuations in salinity, and seasonal changes in temperature. To determine the potential contributions of salinity and temperature to observed seasonal population fluctuations, we tested the survival and egg production of G. pectinatus at two temperatures (10 degreesC and 20 degreesC) and in a range of 'salinities' (20 to 2700 mg l(-1) Cl). Adult survival was highest in 1000 mg l(-1) Cl at 10 degreesC, when 50% still remained alive after 23 d. Increases in salinity and temperature decreased the survival time to less than 10 d. The salinities tolerated were well below the maximum of 2500 mg l(-1) Cl recorded in the lake. There was no difference in adult survival between males and females. Eggs were produced in salinities of up to 600 mg l(-1) Cl. Only in 20 mg l(-1) Cl did an increase in temperature reduce clutch retention time, and increase the rate of egg production. The rate of increase in salinity did not affect copepod survival, but acclimation at an intermediate salinity increased survival at 10 degreesC. Our results suggest that high temperatures and salinities in summer may lower the fitness of this population of G. pectinatus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The processes leading to sedimentation of initially buoyant polymers are poorly understood for inland waters. This study investigated the impact of biofilm formation and aggregation on the density of buoyant polyethylene microplastics. Biofilm formation on polyethylene films (4 x 4 x 0.15 mm) was studied in a eutrophic reservoir (Bautzen, Saxony, Germany). Additionally, aggregation dynamics of small PE microplastics (similar to 85 mu m) with cyanobacteria were investigated in laboratory experiments. During summer phototrophic sessile cyanobacteria (Chamaesiphon spp. and Leptolyngbya spp.) precipitated calcite while forming biofilms on microplastics incubated in Bautzen reservoir. Subsequently the density of the biofilms led to sinking of roughly 10% of the polyethylene particles within 29 days of incubation. In the laboratory experiments planktonic cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp.) formed large and dense cell aggregates under the influence of elevated Ca2+ concentrations. These aggregates enclosed microplastic particles and led to sinking of a small portion (similar to 0.4 %) of polyethylene microplastics. This study showed that both sessile and planktonic phototrophic microorganisms mediate processes influenced by calcium which facilitates densification and sinking of microplastics in freshwater reservoirs. Loss of buoyancy leads to particle sedimentation and could be a prerequisite for the permanent burial of microplastics within reservoir sediments. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bellido, JL; Peltomaa, E; Ojala, A				Bellido, Jessica Lopez; Peltomaa, Elina; Ojala, Anne			An urban boreal lake basin as a source of CO2 and CH4	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Up to now, carbon gas fluxes from urban lakes in the boreal zone have seldom been studied. In summer 2005 we investigated fluxes from an urban boreal lake basin in southern Finland with long history of eutrophication and anoxia. Hypolimnetic CO2 and CH4 concentrations were high compared to other boreal lakes. During the open-water period, the lake basin acted as a source of CO2 and CH4 with fluxes of 2.10 mol m(-2) and 0.04 mol m(-2), respectively. Despite the high oxidation rate (83%), CH4 flux was higher than in other lakes and CH4 contributed 60% to Global Warming Potential. The ratio of carbon emission to accumulation was 4, i.e. emissions were an important route for carbon departure but less so than in rural lakes. Since the lake oxygen conditions affected nutrient availability, there was a positive feedback from hypolimnion to carbon uptake, which was reflected in gas concentrations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This harsh, high-elevation environment is known to exact a heavy demographic toll on recent migrants, and such costs likely erected a substantial biogeographic barrier to initial human colonization. This chapter presents a series of simple metapopulation models that link processes of colonization to mutually exclusive archeological predictions. Current archeological evidence from the northern Tibetan Plateau suggests that seasonal forays into high elevation settings were "adaptive radiations" coincident with the appearance of both Early (ca. 30 ka) and Late Upper Paleolithic (ca. 15 ka) adaptations in low-elevation source areas around the Plateau. More permanent occupation of the Plateau probably did not begin before ca. 8200 ka and may have been driven by "competitive exclusion" of Late Upper Paleolithic foragers from low-elevation environments by emerging settled agricultural groups. The appearance of specialized epi-Paleolithic blade and bladelet technologies on the high Plateau, after 8200 ka, may indicate "directional selection" impacting these new full-time residents. An adaptive radiation of agriculturalists into the mid-elevations of the Plateau, this time leading to year-round occupation, is again seen after 6000 Cal yr BP. The short chronology presented here contradicts genetic-based models suggesting that human populations may have been resident on the Tibetan Plateau for as long as 30,000 years. If the short chronology withstands further empirical scrutiny, it suggests either that initial colonists were genetically predisposed to the rapid accumulation of mutations leading to successful physiological adaptation, or that high-elevation selective pressures are much more severe than usually conceived.

On-site natural evaporation achieved high yield of lithium and a "ultra high multiple enrichment" of 134 times. Using first-principles calculations, the adsorption behavior and mechanism of Li+ on the surfaces of Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O, NaCl, and KCl crystals were investigated. It was found that the migration of lithium during mineral precipitation in brine evaporation was restricted by the adsorption capacity of Li+ on the surface of minerals (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O > NaCl > KCl). The specific surface area, adsorption concentration of Li+, and surface roughness of the three crystals were tested. The results indicated that the specific surface area and roughness of the three crystals were in the following order: Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O > NaCl > KCl, which is consistent with the simulation results. These research findings provide a reference basis for the efficient lithium extraction from Tibetan sodium sulfate subtype salt lakes.					wang, Jiacheng/A-8458-2008; ZHANG, Hongzhong/G-2931-2011														0011-9164	1873-4464				NOV 15	2023	566								116908	10.1016/j.desal.2023.116908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2023.116908		AUG 2023											WOS:001062874100001

One site in the St. Lawrence River was monitored from May 15 to October 30 for two consecutive years (1994-1995) to study the seasoned variations in the prevalence of lip neoplasms. Other sites were sampled within a few days in October 1995 or May 1996. Lesions were found in fish from four of the five sites. The prevalence at each site varied from 0 to 41.6% and, as found in the Great Lakes, was highest in fish populations from urbanized/industrialized sites. Lip neoplams were detected almost only in fish >350 mm (total length). The prevalence was slightly higher in fish captured in the spring, but the low sample size did not permit statistical detection of this seasonal variation. There was a significant positive correlation (Spearman r(s) = 0.83) between fish length and the prevalence and size of lesions. The prevalence was similar between sexes, and the condition factor was significantly lower in fish with papillomas from one site only. In future studies, fish size and season of capture should be taken into account to compare the prevalence of lip neoplasms of white sucker from different sites.

Riverine and Reservoir Influences on Year Class Strength and Growth of Upper Great Plains Paddlefish	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE												A long-term investigation (1991-2006) was conducted on the relation between Yellowstone and Missouri River discharges, water level (elevation) changes of Lake Sakakawea, a Missouri River mainstem reservoir in western North Dakota, and the ecology of the Yellowstone-Sakakawea stock of paddlefish Polyodon spathula, a zooplanktivorous Acipenseriform fish. After impoundment in December 1953, Lake Sakakawea filled gradually over a 13-year period (1953-1966). Water levels were lowered sharply and briefly in 1977 and 1981 and for much more prolonged periods of 1988-1993 and 2000-2006 associated with drought conditions in the central United States and water management decisions by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. The 1995 year class of paddlefish, by far the strongest in the 16-year study period, was associated with the sharp rise in water level from August 1993 through 1995, the longest continuous rise since the initial filling and the only period since initial filling when reservoir levels rose substantially in three consecutive years. High reservoir levels were associated with higher densities of zooplankton (all taxa combined and Leptodora kindtii, the primary food of age 0 paddlefish), stronger year classes (based on counts of age 0 fish along standard transects), greater mean weight and condition of age 0 fish in August, greater mean weights of recruits, higher growth rate of adult fish, and greater weight of gonadal fat bodies (GFBs), an indicator of energy storage, in absolute weight, as a percentage of gonad weight, and as a percentage of fish weight. Sixty-three percent of the variation in the ratio of GFB weight/gonad weight was explained by reservoir level. Fish tagged as adult migrants and recaptured in succeeding years after rearing in rising and high reservoir conditions gained an average of 0.04 kg/yr, whereas fish rearing in falling- and low-reservoir conditions lost an average of 0.19 kg/yr. Missouri River discharge during spring was significantly correlated with estimated age 0 year class strength, but a similar relationship did not hold for the Yellowstone River, which is the river used by most spawning paddlefish. Results of this study are consistent with studies from Lake Sakakawea and other reservoirs indicating that trophic upsurge in recently filled (and refilled) reservoirs favors the development of stronger year classes, faster growth, better condition, and larger size at maturity of fishes. Higher riverine discharges, thought to favor paddlefish reproductive success, were also typically associated with a rising or high reservoir. In contrast, low-reservoir levels over the period 2000-2006 have negatively affected paddlefish year class strength, growth, and energy storage. If, in succeeding years, Lake Sakakawea once again is allowed to rise to full pool as it did over the period 1993-1995, inundation of the shorelines and the vegetation can be expected to result in another upsurge period and a resulting benefit to paddlefish. Effective management of water levels in Lake Sakakawea for the benefit of paddlefish and other fishes will require a more balanced approach between upper basin and lower basin Missouri River interests.																			1064-1262	1547-6553					2009	17	2					241	266		10.1080/10641260802621791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10641260802621791													WOS:000264651000008

Lake, yearly, and seasonal variation in biomass was evaluated by quantitative, replicated seining. Species richness averaged 12.8 in our lakes, and 24 species were collected overall. Total littoral fish biomass averaged 13.5 g.m-2 overall and varied significantly among lakes (range 6.1-26.9 g.m-2) and between early and late summer. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) occurred in all lakes and were the most abundant species overall, averaging 57% of the total fish biomass. Principal component ordination of littoral fish communities showed little evidence for aggregation of community types. Species richness was positively correlated with lake surface area (r2 = 0.62), as has been shown in other studies. Total fish biomass was positively correlated with biomass of chironomids (r2 = 0.57), which constituted 24% of the littoral invertebrate biomass in our lakes and are important prey of many fish species. We found no significant correlation between total fish biomass and total invertebrate biomass or between biomass of any of the dominant fish species and limnological or prey variables.

The only fish species known to occur in Lake Van is the anadromous cyprinid Chalcalburnus tarichi PALLAS (BERG 1964). This paper presents the first report on the life history of this remarkable endemic fish species. Unpublished observations made over the past decade are combined with results obtained on fish collected and studied during an expedition to Lake Van in summer 1990. Gross morphological and anatomical characteristics of C tarichi are described and a taxonomical review is presented. An overview on growth, reproduction, nutrition, spawning migrations and adaptational abilities of the fish is given. Moreover, an update on the biological and physico-chemical living conditions in Lake Van is provided.																			0003-9136					NOV	1992	126	1					105	125																WOS:A1992KB13200007

To evaluate the size-based exposure risk from Lake Michigan fish consumption, we estimated PCB exposure probabilities for five Lake Michigan fish species using two Bayesian models. The models confirm that very few individuals of any of the five species are likely to have PCB concentrations low enough to fall into the category in which consumption is unrestricted. Among smaller fish (<50 cm), brown trout have the highest PCB levels, while lake trout are the most contaminated among larger fish (> 60 cm). Eating meals from multiple individuals of some species results in a high probability that at least one of the meals will exceed 1.9 mg/kg, the upper PCB concentration recommended for consumption in the advisory.

Along Chicago's 26 miles of public beaches the populous urban environment and this freshwater environment meet. While city-led monitoring initiatives investigate pathogenic bacteria in these nearshore waters, very little is known about other microbial species present. We collected surface water samples from two Chicago public beaches Montrose Beach and 57th Street Beach - every ten days from June 5 through August 4, 2013 as well as once in early Fall (October 4, 2013). Sixteen bacterial communities in total were surveyed through targeted sequencing of the V4 16S rRNA gene. Taxa were identified using Mothur. Raw sequence data is available via NCBI's SRA database (part of BioProject PRJNA245802). OTU calls for each read are also available at our online repository: www.lakemichiganmicrobes.com/bacteria/.

Water level change of Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile: Prediction using teleconnections with sea surface temperatures	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water level change of Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile was analyzed. Correlations between the water level change and global sea surface temperature (GSST) were calculated and teleconnections were found. Prediction of water level was performed using a recurrent artificial neural network model. First, the seasonal change of water level was divided into three phases, the rising, recession 1, and recession 2 phases. The water level increased during the rising phase, decreased rapidly during the recession 1 phase, and decreased at a uniform rate during the recession 2 phase. To find teleconnections of the water level change in the rising phase with GSST, correlations between the level change and GSST were calculated. Sea regions on the Pacific Ocean indicated significant correlations with the level change at lag 0-1 month and lag 6-7 months. There was a strongly correlated sea zone over the western Pacific Ocean at time lags of 6-7 months. To predict water level change, SST time series of the correlated zone was applied to a recurrent neural network model. Predictions of changes of the rise of the water level of Lake Tana during the rainy season from teleconnections with SSTs via the neural network model simulated the observed changes well (r = 0.795). Prediction of the changes of Lake Tana's water level with a lead time of 6-7 months can greatly facilitate management of the lake's water resources.

J	Baldantoni, D; Bellino, A				Baldantoni, Daniela; Bellino, Alessandro			On the Capability of the Epigeous Organs of Phragmites australis to Act as Metal Accumulators in Biomonitoring Studies	SUSTAINABILITY												With a view of shedding light on the accumulation capability of the epigeous organs of common reed (Phragmites australis), employed worldwide in metal biomonitoring, an accumulation study of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn was performed, focusing on leaves belonging to different whorls and culms. To this end, in five sampling sites on the littoral zone of the volcanic Lake Averno (Italy), and in one occasion (autumn) before plant senescence, leaves of different ages and culms were collected and analyzed for metal concentrations. In terms of the suitability for biomonitoring, culms demonstrated poor performances in relation to the low metal accumulation and the difficulties in sampling and processing, whereas leaves proved their effectiveness in highlighting whole plant exposure. Since the accumulation degree of Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn is unaffected by leaf age, the pooling of leaves from different whorls is advisable to improve the representativeness of samplings. This strategy becomes mandatory in the case of Ni, the non-monotonic age-dependent variations of which would affect the derivation of contamination gradients otherwise. For Mn, Cd and Pb, the accumulation patterns strictly dependent on age can instead be exploited in selecting the sensitivity of biomonitoring by focusing on the organs where they are preferentially accumulated: old leaves for Mn and young leaves for Cd and Pb.					; Baldantoni, Daniela/ABA-4273-2020	BALDANTONI, Daniela/0000-0002-6794-0107; 														2071-1050				JUL	2021	13	14							7745	10.3390/su13147745	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147745													WOS:000676958500001

Description of two new species of monoraphid diatoms	DIATOM RESEARCH												Light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations were used to describe two new species of the freshwater monoraphid genusCrenotiaWojtal. Both species,Crenotia distincta, sp. nov. andCrenotia oblonga, sp. nov. have a unique stria structure, bi- to multiseriate terminating near the axial area. Internally, these terminal areolae have C-shaped openings that are occluded by a tapering flap, a feature unique toCrenotiaspecies in China. The two species are easily distinguished from each other and from other members of the genus in both LM (size and valve outline) and SEM stria structure. The bi- to multiseriate nature of the striae suggests an affinity of this genus withPlanothidium, but further phylogenetic analyses are required before the phylogenetic position of this genus is settled. Verified records ofCrenotiaare currently known from Europe and Asia, although species included in the genus by Wojtal have also been reported from North Africa and North America. The genus was originally described from springs but seems to have a wider ecological distribution.

EFFECT OF HYALOCLASTITE BRECCIA BOULDERS ON MESO-SCALE PERIGLACIAL-AEOLIAN LANDSYSTEM IN SEMI-ARID ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT, JAMES ROSS ISLAND, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												In this study we aim to describe the processes leading to the creation of a specific periglacial and aeolian landsystem, which evolves around the hyaloclastite breccia boulders on James Ross Island, north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula. These boulders were deposited as a result of the Late Holocene advance of Whisky Glacier, forming a well-developed boulder train approximately 5-km long, stretching front Whisky Glacier moraine to Brandy Bay. The combination of ground temperature monitoring, snow cover measurements, grain size analysis and field survey were used to quantify and understand the interplay of periglacial and aeolian processes leading to the formation of the specific meso-scale landsystent around the boulders. The ground temperature probes were installed during January 2017 in the vicinity of two selected boulders. The two study sites, at Monolith Lake (large boulder) and Keller Stream (smaller boulder), were also fitted with snow stakes and trail cameras. An automatic weather station (AWS) on the Abernethy Flats, located approximately two kilometres to the north-west, was used as a reference site for ground temperature and snow cover thickness. The hyaloclastite breccia boulders act as obstacles to wind and trap wind-blown snow, resulting in the formation of snow accumulations on their windward and lee sides. These accumulations affect ground thermal regime and lead to the transport of fine particles by meltwater from the snow during the summer season. The snow cover also traps wind-blown fine sand resulting in the formation of finegrained rims on the windward and lee sides of the boulders after the snow has melted. Furthermore, the meltwater affects ground moisture content, creating favourable, but spatially limited conditions for colonisation by mosses and lichens.

Seasonal and Spatial Variations of Dissolved Organic Matter Biodegradation along the Aquatic Continuum in the Southern Taiga Bog Complex, Western Siberia	WATER												The inland aquatic ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, owing to the metabolism of terrestrially derived organic matter as it moves through fluvial networks along the water continuum. During this transport, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is microbial processed and released into the atmosphere, but the degree and intensity of this processing vary greatly both spatially and temporally. The Western Siberian Lowlands is of particular interest for a quantitative assessment of DOM biodegradation potential because the global areal-scale effects of DOM biodegradation in abundant surface organic-rich waters might be the highest in this region. To this end, we collected water samples along a typical aquatic continuum of the Bakchar Bog (the north-eastern part of the Great Vasyugan Mire) and, following standardized protocol, conducted an experimental study aimed at characterizing the seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biodegradability. The biodegradable DOC fraction (BDOC) over the exposure incubation period ranged from 2% to 25%. The natural aquatic continuum "mire-forest-stream-river" demonstrated the systematic evolution of biodegradable DOC among the sites and across the seasons. The highest biodegradation rates were measured during spring flood in May and decreased along the continuum. The maximum possible CO2 production from DOM yielded the maximum possible flux in the range of 0.1 and 0.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) day(-1) d, which is an order of magnitude lower than the actual net CO2 emissions from the inland waters of the WSL. This study suggests that although the biodegradation of the humic waters of the WSL can sizably modify the concentration and nature of the DOM along the aquatic continuum, it plays only a subordinary role in overall C emissions from the lakes and rivers of the region.

The study area, the Itumbiara Reservoir (Brazil) at the beginning of the austral winter, is characterized by the presence of a weak thermal stratification and the passage of several cold fronts. Both in situ observations and numerical modelling showed that the surface circulation is wind-driven. The strongest water current was observed at 13:00h, which lagged behind the strongest wind. The daily heat budget was negative during the period and was controlled by short-wave radiation and latent heat flux. The diurnal cycle of stratification was at its maximum at 17:00h, and the surface mixed layer deepens at night. The colder waters of the Paranaiba River contribute to the stability of the water column near the river-reservoir transition zone.					; Rennó, Camilo/B-9070-2014; Alcantara, Enner/H-4286-2012; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016; Assireu, Arcilan/AAY-2310-2021; Renno, Camilo/I-7625-2014; Curtarelli, Marcelo/H-4455-2019	Curtarelli, Marcelo/0000-0002-9316-8915; Alcantara, Enner/0000-0002-7777-2119; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/0000-0002-3950-4041; Renno, Camilo/0000-0001-9920-4473; 													1747-6585	1747-6593				DEC	2014	28	4					516	525		10.1111/wej.12066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12066													WOS:000344626600008

COASTAL AND OFFSHORE COUNTS OF MIGRATORY SPARROWS AND WARBLERS AS REVEALED BY RECORDINGS OF NOCTURNAL FLIGHT CALLS ALONG THE OHIO COAST OF LAKE ERIE	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The identification of migratory pathways is critical to understanding potential risks affecting migratory birds. The Great Lakes are an important stopover area along the migratory pathway of millions of nocturnally migrating songbirds. However, large expanses of open water can act as a geographic barrier to migrating songbirds resulting in flight "detours" and increased mortality. We recorded nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory warblers (one species and one species group) and sparrows (three species) at four sites along the Ohio coastline of Lake Erie during two spring migratory seasons. One pair of coastal and offshore sites was located in the central basin, another pair of coastal and offshore sites was located in the western basin with its associated island archipelago connecting Ohio with Ontario. Acoustic monitoring of NFCs suggested that (1) fewer birds were recorded aloft over offshore, open water sites compared to closely associated coastal sites; (2) sparrows apparently were more influenced by location in the Lake Erie basin than warblers. In summary, although many warbler and sparrow migrants cross Lake Erie, the lake appears to be a barrier for at least some members of the studied species groups. However, consistent with previous studies, the western basin appears more amenable to a lake crossing, particularly for sparrows. While interpretation of NFC data should be done with caution, our findings suggest differential passage over Lake Erie by nocturnal songbird migrants.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				SEP	2016	128	3					503	509		10.1676/1559-4491-128.3.503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491-128.3.503													WOS:000384566900004

Monitoring objectives were directed towards providing high resolution data needed to examine lake temporal and spatial variability. During the first year of post-restoration (1983), anaerobic conditions developed in the lake and a major fish kill (Ictalurus sp.) was observed. Total phosphorus concentrations at stations nearest the lake bottom were exceedingly high (> 0.400 mg L-1), suggesting the source of phosphorus was sediment release. Monitoring conducted in 1984 indicated the re-establishment of high benthic demand and internal nutrient recycling patterns. Mean phosphorus levels increased by more than 50% over the observed 1983 values, while dissolved oxygen concentrations demonstrated gradients from surface to bottom and were consistently below 2.0 mg L-1 in the bottom waters.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	1987	9	1					13	24		10.1007/BF00394212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00394212								24254097					WOS:A1987H993000002

Large-scale climatic drivers of bison distribution and abundance in North America since the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												As the dominant large herbivore in midcontinent North America since the terminal Pleistocene, bison (Bison spp.) have been a fundamental component of ecosystems and economies. Despite the importance of bison in late Quaternary North America, large-scale (regional to continental) patterns of bison biogeography are not well understood. Here we integrate archaeological and paleontological bison occurrence data with simulated climate data to better understand long-term drivers of bison distribution and abundance in North America. We used these records to model bison distribution and abundance over the past 20 thousand years at 1-thousand-year intervals. Our results show that late Quaternary changes in the distribution and abundance of bison were influenced by large-scale trends in temperature and precipitation. The distribution of bison since the BollingeAllerod Interstadial (ca. 14 ka) is primarily explained by seasonal temperature patterns (mean temperature of the coldest quarter is the most important variable for 12 of the 14 1-thousand-year intervals). The modeled climate of bison distributions progressively narrowed since the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 20 ka) as bison populations retracted from disjunct Pleistocene refugia and congregated in midcontinent rangelands. Through the Pleistocene Holocene transition, bison experienced rapidly warming summer temperatures that increased faster in midcontinent North America than other regions and the continent as a whole. Model results suggest that Holocene bison abundance was influenced by hydroclimatic shifts that affected the quality and availability of forage. Bison abundances decreased through the dry early and mid-Holocene and increased when moisture availability improved in the late Holocene. We infer that bison have thrived under a broad range of environmental conditions since the Last Glacial Maximum and that the climatic and biogeographic space occupied by bison narrowed in recent millennia. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Deterioration of Water Quality Between 2017 and 2021 in the Coronel Aquifer, Chile	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The Coronel aquifer, located in Chile (36 degrees S - 37 degrees S), has experienced significant water quality deterioration, primarily due to environmental factors and anthropogenic pressures, including increased industrial activities, rising temperatures, and reduced precipitation. These factors synergistically contribute to higher pollutant concentrations. Fluctuations in metal ion levels, particularly total iron and total manganese, have frequently exceeded the regulatory limits for human consumption (0.3 mg L-1 and 0.1 mg L-1, respectively). In response, companies exploiting these aquifers have intensified the search for alternative water sources with better quality. This study analyzed the interannual and seasonal patterns of water quality in the Coronel aquifer, focusing on the hydrogeological sectors of common use (HSCU) in North and South Coronel, alongside hydrogeological measurements and environmental variables. The findings revealed that the North Coronel HSCU is predominantly affected by allochthonous organic pollutants (NO3-), whereas the South Coronel HSCU is impacted by metal pollutants (Fe and Mn). Metal ion concentrations exhibited pronounced interannual and seasonal dynamics, peaking during the summer when precipitation drops below 100 mm month-1 and average monthly temperatures exceed 14 degrees C. In contrast, NO3- levels did not demonstrate a clear interannual or seasonal pattern. The study suggests that anthropogenic pressures in both HSCU may facilitate the presence of these contaminants.

Incorporating wind sheltering and sediment heat flux into 1-D models of small boreal lakes: a case study with the Canadian Small Lake Model V2.0	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Lake models are increasingly being incorporated into global and regional climate and numerical weather prediction systems. Lakes interact with their surroundings through flux exchange at their bottom sediments and with the atmosphere at the surface, and these linkages must be well represented in fully coupled prognostic systems in order to completely elucidate the role of lakes in the climate system. In this study schemes for the inclusion of wind sheltering and sediment heat flux simple enough to be included in any 1-D lake model are presented. Example simulations with the Canadian Small Lake Model show improvements in surface-wind-driven mixing and temperature in summer and a reduction of the bias in the change in heat content under ice compared with a published simulation based on an earlier version of the model.																			1991-959X	1991-9603				JUL 17	2019	12	7					3045	3054		10.5194/gmd-12-3045-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-3045-2019													WOS:000475762500002

In 2002, the RNA/DNA ratio responded to degree-days accumulated over periods of 7-8 days before sampling, while in 2003, no relationship with temperature was established. The growth patterns obtained each year probably reflect indices responding to different limiting variables. In 2002, temperature would have been limiting, whereas in 2003, other factors such as prey availability, food quality, and competition may have influenced growth. In addition, the discrepancy between total length and RNA/DNA ratio observed in 2003 may reflect a differential time of response to limiting variables. These results together show that the two indices reflect growth at different time scales and suggest that their combination can help identify shifts between limiting environmental variables. Also, growth in managed wetlands during springtime was systematically superior to that in the natural environment, supporting the contention that managed wetlands are highly productive habitats. In natural habitats, growth rates were higher on the south shore by summer, which is consistent with the established north-south productivity gradient in Lake Saint-Pierre.

J	Carrel, JE				Carrel, JE			Ecology of two burrowing wolf spiders (Araneae: Lycosidae) syntopic in Florida scrub:: Burrow/body size relationships and habitat preferences	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												This fourteen year long study in the Florida scrub on the Lake Wales Ridge demonstrated that visually searching for open burrows of Geolycosa spiders was an effective method for sampling populations in the winter dry season, except one year when abnormally high precipitation during an El Ni (n) over tildeo event caused many spiders to close their burrows. Not only could the two endemic Geolycosa species be identified by the architecture of their burrow entrances (G. xera archboldi McCrone was aturricolous and G. hubbelli Wallace was turricolous), but the diameter of the burrow opening was highly correlated with the size of the resident spider and the volume of its burrow. The two syntopic Geolycosa species preferred different microhabitats: G. xera archboldi regardless of size was found in barren sand (0-10% litter coverage) whereas G. hubbelli shifted preference as it grew in size (going from 20 to 80% litter coverage). In addition each species exhibited significant habitat preferences: G. xera archboldi was most common in sand pine scrub with rosemary, the most xeric and least common habitat in the scrub; G. hubbelli was most abundant in scrubby flatwoods with sand live oak and in ridge sandhill with scrub hickory, both of which are relatively mesic sites with open canopies.																			0022-8567					JAN	2003	76	1					16	30																WOS:000180874700002

In this paper we describe the limnology and biology of the Dufek Massif, using a range of observational, microscopic and molecular methods. Here two dry valleys are home to some of the southernmost biota on Earth. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms, being found in lakes and ponds, in hypersaline brines, summer melt water, relict pond beds and in exposed terrestrial habitats. Their species diversity was the lowest yet observed in Antarctic lakes. Green algae, cercozoa and bacteria were present, but diatoms were absent except for a single valve; likely windblown. Mosses were absent and only one lichen specimen was found. The Metazoa included three microbivorous tardigrades (Acutuncus antarcticus, Diphascon sanae and Echiniscus (cf) pseudowendti) and bdelloid rotifer species, but no arthropods or nematodes. These simple faunal and floral communities are missing most of the elements normally present at lower latitudes in the Antarctic which is probably a result of the very harsh environmental conditions in the area.

J	O'Hara, SL; Metcalfe, SE				O'Hara, SL; Metcalfe, SE			The climate of Mexico since the Aztec period	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Fluctuations in the climate of Mexico since the Aztec period (1345-1994) are established using a variety of primary and secondary historical sources. Drought conditions prevailed when the Aztecs entered the Basin of Mexico, but the climate became wetter shortly after this time and the period 1345-1640 appears to have been relatively wet. From 1640 to 1915 the country experienced a series of prolonged and devastating droughts which were extremely severe in the mid to late 1700s and the late 1800s. This interval coincides with periods of adverse weather conditions elsewhere in the world and may represent the period of the Little Ice Age. Since the early 1900s there has been a shift towards somewhat wetter conditions in Mexico. Variations in precipitation over this period can be explained by changes in the strength of the summer monsoon. (C) 1997 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

The decline has followed artificial control of the water level in the lake. To examine the environmental requirements at the seedling establishment stage, we investigated the survival and growth of emerged seedlings at various microsites on the lakeshore by manipulating environmental conditions such as exposure to waves, inundation, and light availability so as to include the conditions of the presumed safe sites. Seedling survival at the early stage was affected most by environmental variables relating to the susceptibility to inundation. Survival until seedling establishment was profoundly affected by light availability as well as by susceptibility to inundation. In all, 136 genets were established in quadrats less prone to inundation and with sufficient light availability, which is consistent with the presumed safe-site characteristics of the original water regime: bare ground exposed during the spring water-level drawdown. Recovering the original water regime with seasonal drawdown will be indispensable for recovering a self-sustainable population. However, as first-aid measures, active restoration efforts through adaptive management using the remnant soil seed bank are urgently needed before the soil seed bank becomes exhausted.

Central Asia Cold Case: Siberian Pine Fingers New Suspects in Growth Decline CA 1700 CE	PLANTS-BASEL												Tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus sibirica Du Tour from near the upper treeline in the Western Sayan, Southern Siberia are found to have an exceptional (below mean-3SD) multi-year drop near 1700 CE, highlighted by the seven narrowest-ring years in a 1524-2022 regional chronology occurring in the short span of one decade. Tree rings are sometimes applied to reconstruct seasonal air temperatures; therefore, it is important to identify other factors that may have contributed to the growth suppression. The spatiotemporal scope of the "nosedive" in tree growth is investigated with a large network of P. sibirica (14 sites) and Larix sibirica Ledeb. (61 sites) chronologies, as well as with existing climatic reconstructions, natural archives, documentary evidence (e.g., earthquake records), and climate maps based on 20th-century reanalysis data. We conclude that stress from low summer temperatures in the Little Ice Age was likely exacerbated by tree damage associated with weather extremes, including infamous Mongolian "dzuds", over 1695-1704. A tropical volcanic eruption in 1695 is proposed as the root cause of these disturbances through atmospheric circulation changes, possibly an amplified Scandinavia Northern Hemisphere teleconnection pattern. Conifer tree rings and forest productivity recorded this event across all of Altai-Sayan region.					; Belokopytova, Liliana/T-4345-2017; Babushkina, Elena/AAH-7355-2019; Zhirnova, Dina/AAH-7389-2019; Mapitov, Nariman/ABF-5455-2021; Vaganov, Eugene/U-2379-2019	Nariman, Mapitov/0000-0001-9994-9299; Belokopytova, Liliana/0000-0002-8475-7304; Babushkina, Elena/0000-0002-1355-4307; Meko, David/0000-0002-5171-2724; 													2223-7747					JAN	2025	14	2							287	10.3390/plants14020287	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants14020287								39861640					WOS:001403826800001

Use of the Veggie Meter® as a tool to objectively approximate fruit and vegetable intake among youth for evaluation of preschool and school-based interventions	JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS												Background Reflection spectroscopy is an emerging, non-invasive objective measure used to approximate fruit and vegetable intake. The present study aimed to use a reflection spectroscopy device (the Veggie Meter (R), Longevity Link Corporation, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) to assess skin carotenoid status in preschool, middle- and high-school students and to examine associations between skin carotenoids and self-reported dietary intake. Methods In Autumn 2018, we used the Veggie Meter (R) to assess skin carotenoids and age-appropriate validated dietary assessment measures to approximate fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Preschool participants completed a previously validated pictorial liking tool using an iPad (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA). Middle-school participants completed selected questions from the validated School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) (Michael & Susan Dell Center for Healthy Living, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA) questionnaire regarding frequency of their FV and beverage intake on the previous day, with additional questions about physical activity. High-school participants' FV intake was assessed using the Fruit and Vegetable Screener (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA). Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine bivariate associations between measures of dietary intake and Veggie Meter (R)-assessed skin carotenoid levels. Results Mean (SD) Veggie Meter (R) readings were 266 (82.9), 219 (68.1) and 216 (67.2) among preschool, middle- and high-school students. There was an inverse association between soda intake and Veggie Meter (R) readings (r = -0.22, P = 0.03) among middle-school students; and a positive association between daily fruit intake and Veggie Meter (R) readings (r = 0.25, P = 0.06) among high-school students. Conclusions The Veggie Meter (R) comprises a promising evaluation tool for preschool and school-based nutrition interventions.					; Kelley, Casey/KJK-9684-2024; Carraway-Stage, Virginia/ABI-1406-2020	May, Kimberly/0000-0002-8861-4407; Kelley, Casey/0000-0001-7770-1639; Stage, Virginia/0000-0002-6152-1438; 													0952-3871	1365-277X				DEC	2020	33	6					869	875		10.1111/jhn.12755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.12755		APR 2020						32281191					WOS:000525985900001

On a monthly basis over the course of the year, positive vertical temperature and vapor pressure differences were observed, though negative vertical temperature differences occurred occasionally during some short periods when overwater air masses were warmer than the water surface. Consequently, the unstable atmospheric surface layer (ASL) and sufficient mechanical mixing led to positive sensible H and latent lambda E heat fluxes. The quantities H and lambda E were distinctively out of phase with the net radiation Rn. The H and lambda E from the water to the ASL was still substantial on nights with a negative Rn and in winter when Rn was very small. From February to August, approximately 60%-91% of the Rn was used for H and lambda E, with the remainder being stored in the water. Fueled by the previously stored heat in the water, H and lambda E exceeded Rn by almost 3 times from September to January. Nighttime evaporation represented a large loss of water (i.e., lambda E = 82.8 W m(-2) at night versus 91.4 W m(-2) during the daytime). Intraseasonal and seasonal variations in H and lambda E were strongly affected by frequent passages of large-scale air masses that were brought in by different synoptic weather systems (e.g., cyclones or anticyclones). The authors' analysis suggested that this southern reservoir responded to atmospheric forcings on both diurnal and seasonal scales in the same ways as northern lakes of comparable sizes and depths.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				DEC	2012	13	6					1893	1910		10.1175/JHM-D-12-020.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-12-020.1													WOS:000312628700015

Detailed morphological analysis using both light and scanning electron microscopy revealed sufficient morphological differentiation from known species to describe these as new species: H. helderiana sp. nov and H. mitosis sp. nov. Formal descriptions are presented, each illustrated by light and scanning electron micrographs, and the new species are compared with similar Humidophila taxa worldwide. Additionally, eight previously described species which were also observed are discussed, and Humidophila mochalovae comb. nov., formerly belonging to the genus Diadesmis, was transferred to Humidophila. Of these known species, six have not been previously reported from Greenland, expanding their known geographic distributions. Our findings bring the total number of Humidophila species globally to 87 and contribute to a better understanding of the terrestrial Arctic diatom flora.

Poulations of both ammonia and nitrite oxidizers as estimated by most probable number (MPN) were sustained throughout extended anaerobic summer intervals, with nitrite oxidizers outnumbering ammonia oxidizers by a factor ranging from 3.0 to 8.1. Ammonia oxidation potential on a per cell basis was affected by seasonal changes and was seen to decrease as oxygen was removed from the sediments. Pure-culture isolations from a positive MPN tube inoculated with oxygenated sediment and representing a single point in a seasonal cycle produced ammonia-oxidizing strains belonging to the genus Nitrosospira. These strains did not react with known ammonia-oxidizer serotypes and, therefore, extend the serological diversity of this group of bacteria. An immunofluorescence analysis of MPN tubes from sediment collected during a period of lake stratification revealed progressive changes in the diversity of the ammonia-oxidizer population. The genera Nitrosomonas, Nitrosolobus, and Nitrosospira, including the novel serotype of Nitrosospira isolated from the sediment a year earlier, were found to coexist in well-oxygenated sediment. This diversity was seen to disappear, with Nistrosomonas surviving, as anaerobic conditions persisted.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				NOV	1991	37	11					828	833		10.1139/m91-143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m91-143													WOS:A1991GR97000005

The minimum distance between the two takes is 24 m and their difference in elevation is about 76 m. Breach risks were assessed on the basis of field surveys carried out in the summers of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Empirical formulae for breaching of moraine dams and the BREACH model for earthen dam failure were employed to simulate the breach properties and hydrograph of floods at the breaching site of the dam from the two lakes. The modeling showed that an outburst flood from Longbasaba and Pida lakes would last for about 5.5 hours and have a peak discharge of about 3-5 x 10(4) m(3)/s at about 1.8 hours after the beginning of the outburst.					; Liu, Shiyin/AAT-4278-2020; Guo, Wanqin/E-7553-2015	LIU, Shiyin/0000-0002-9625-7497; Guo, Wanqin/0000-0002-3211-9300													0276-4741	1994-7151				AUG-NOV	2008	28	3-4					310	317		10.1659/mrd.0894	http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/mrd.0894													WOS:000262029500020
J	Yoshimura, M				Yoshimura, Mayumi			Hypothesised life cycle adaptation of stonefly (Plecoptera) in response to increased water temperatures	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Water temperature is the most important and critical factor for freshwater invertebrates and it fluctuates with an increase in air temperature. In this study, the effect of water temperature on egg development was clarified in Stavsolus japonicus, and the response to climate change in stoneflies with long egg periods were considered. Water temperatures prior to 43 days before hatching likely do not affect egg development in Stavsolus japonicus. Instead, they use egg diapause as an adaptive strategy to survive hot summer conditions. Increased water temperatures may cause migration to higher elevations for stoneflies that have lower adaptability in their egg development period, with populations eventually becoming stranded where no higher elevation or cooler habitat is available. Species extinction is expected to increase with increasing temperatures, leading to reduced biodiversity in many ecosystems. Indirect effects of water warming on maturation and reproduction may lead to substantial reductions in benthic invertebrate populations.																			0306-4565	1879-0992				APR	2023	113								103533	10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103533		MAR 2023						37055137					WOS:000956404800001

Turnover times of phosphate were fast in the epilimnion (minutes) but slow (hours) at the depth of the peak. Long turnover times, high concentrations of polyphosphate, low P debt, low Vmax and high half saturation coefficient values for P all indicated that initially the peak was not more P-deficient than epilimnetic phytoplankton. With time it became P-deficient and this factor coincided with its demise in Aug. At no time was the peak population N-deficient. The peak population was not supplied by nutrients from the hypolimnion nor from the mineralization of sedimenting epilimnetic material but instead seemed to have brought cellular reserves of P when it migrated down from the epilimnion.

Preliminary stratigraphic studies and radiometric dating indicate an Early Wisconsinan age between 70 000 and 80 000 BP for the site. All of the herpetological species are cold-tolerant forms that inhabit Nova Scotia today. The turtles are important paleoclimatically, in that they suggest that the summers had a sufficient number of warm days for the successful incubation of their eggs. Together, the herpetological species indicate a quiet, well-vegetated pond or small lake, with peripheral meadows, and the presence of a meandering stream with sand or gravel banks.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				FEB	1995	32	2					210	215		10.1139/e95-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-017													WOS:A1995QQ12600009

Radars enable the simultaneous tracking of many individuals of almost all sizes within the radar range during day and night, and under low visibility conditions. We review how atmospheric conditions, geographic features and human development affect the behavior of migrating insects and birds as recorded by radars. We focus on flight initiation and termination, as well as in-flight behavior that includes changes in animal flight direction, speed and altitude. We have identified several similarities and differences in the behavioral responses of aerial migrants including an overlooked similarity in the use of thermal updrafts by very small (e.g. aphids) and very large (e.g. vultures) migrants. We propose that many aerial migrants modulate their migratory flights in relation to the interaction between atmospheric conditions and geographic features. For example, aerial migrants that encounter crosswind may terminate their flight or continue their migration and may also drift or compensate for lateral displacement depending on their position (over land, near the coast or over sea). We propose several promising directions for future research, including the development and application of algorithms for tracking insects, bats and large aggregations of animals using weather radars. Additionally, an important contribution will be the spatial expansion of aeroecological radar studies to Africa, most of Asia and South America where no such studies have been undertaken. Quantifying the role of migrants in ecosystems and specifically estimating the number of departing birds from stopover sites using low-elevation radar scans is important for quantifying migrant-habitat relationships. This information, together with estimates of population demographics and migrant abundance, can help resolve the long-term dynamics of migrant populations facing large-scale environmental changes.

Determining vertical leakage from the Great Artesian Basin, Australia, through up-scaling field estimates of phreatic evapotranspiration	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Understanding the water balance of large groundwater systems is fundamental for the sustainable management of the resource. The vertical leakage (i.e. discharge to upper aquifers or the unconfined water table) component of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) is an example of a poorly constrained but large component of the water balance of Australia's largest groundwater resource. Field estimates of phreatic evapotranspiration (ET) were made at discharge zones along the southwestern margin of the GAB using eddy covariance station and micro-lysimeter measurements, and inversion of chloride/isotope soil profile measurements. The field estimates were assigned to three major landforms associated with areas of increasingly higher evaporative discharge and progressively decreasing depths to the water table. These landforms were mapped using remote sensing and digital elevation data, with characteristically higher soil moisture, salt precipitation, and lower surface temperature compared to areas distal to discharge zones. Based on the field measurements, broad ranges of phreatic ET (0.5-10, 10-100 and 100-300 mm y(-1)) were assigned to the major land-types. The higher phreatic ET discharge zones mapped by supervised classification of satellite data are 8-28% of the total regional vertical leakage component estimated by numerical modelling of the GAB. In comparison, the higher discharge zones estimated by landform mapping are 73-251% of the total vertical leakage component estimated by modelling. The mapped distribution of the high discharge areas has important implications for modelling of the GAB. In the western sub-basin, most of the estimated recharge can be accounted for by phreatic ET in the high discharge zones located around the Basin margins, implying that vertical leakage rates distal to the margins are very low and that discharge may exceed current recharge. In contrast, the results for the eastern sub-basin suggest that vertical leakage rates around the South Australian portion of the Basin margin are low and that more of the vertical leakage component in the eastern sub-basin is occurring distal to the Basin margins. Consequently, the pathways for vertical leakage in the eastern sub-basin are likely to be more complex than for the western sub-basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

L19704	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The first verifiable reconstruction of spring ( April July) precipitation is presented for Crimea, Ukraine. It is derived from Crimean pine ( Pinus hamata) ring- width data spanning A. D. 1620 - 2002. The reconstruction accounts for 37% of the variance in observed precipitation over 1896 - 1988. Most droughts recorded in Crimean historical documents in the 17th - 19th centuries coincide with below- average reconstructed precipitation in the concurrent or following year. An 11- year filtered version of the reconstruction correlates with an annually- laminated sediment- thickness record from Saki Lake ( 4188 years in length), once this record is shifted backward by 15 years. The offset may be explained by anthropogenic changes at the lake in the late 19th century. The significant relationship between the lake sediments and reconstruction suggests that the lake record is also a moisture indicator. If so, the wettest period of the past 1500 years ( similar to AD1050 - 1250) broadly coincides with the " Medieval Warm Period'' ( MWP) in Crimea.					; Solomina, Olga/J-8353-2013	Davi, Nicole/0000-0002-4529-5418; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				OCT 4	2005	32	19							L19704	10.1029/2005GL023335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GL023335													WOS:000232551900002
J	Schallenberg, M; Burns, CW				Schallenberg, M; Burns, CW			Effects of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton production: teasing apart the influences of light, nutrients and algal entrainment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Wind-induced sediment resuspension can affect planktonic primary productivity by influencing light penetration and nutrient availability, and by contributing meroplankton (algae resuspended from the lake bed) to the water column. We established relationships between sediment resuspension, light and nutrient availability to phytoplankton in a shallow lake on four occasions. 2. The effects of additions of surficial sediments and nutrients on the productivity of phytoplankton communities were measured in 300 mL gas-tight bottles attached to rotating plankton wheels and exposed to a light gradient, in 24 h incubations at in situ temperatures. 3. While sediment resuspension always increased primary productivity, resuspension released phytoplankton from nutrient limitation in only two of the four experiments because the amount of available nitrogen and phosphorus entrained from the sediments was small compared with typical baseline levels in the water column. In contrast, chlorophyll a entrainment was substantial compared with baseline water column concentrations and the contribution of meroplankton to primary production was important at times, especially when seasonal irradiance in the lake was high. 4. Comparison of the in situ light climate with the threshold of light-limitation of the phytoplankton indicated that phytoplankton in the lake were only likely to be light-limited at times of extreme turbidity (e.g. >200 nephelometric turbidity units), particularly when these occur in winter. Therefore, resuspension influenced phytoplankton production mainly via effects on available nutrients and by entraining algae. The importance of each of these varied in time. 5. The partitioning of primary productivity between the water column and sediments in shallow lakes greatly influences the outcome of resuspension events for water column primary productivity.																			0046-5070					FEB	2004	49	2					143	159		10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01172.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2426.2003.01172.x													WOS:000188224600002

Accurate calculations of in situ temperature sensitivities of respiration (Q(10)) are vital for the prediction of future Arctic emissions. To understand the impact of spatial heterogeneity on respiration rates and Q(10), we compared respiration measured from automated chambers across the main local polygonized landscape forms (high and low centers, polygon rims, polygon troughs) to estimates from the flux-partitioned net ecosystem exchange collected in an adjacent eddy covariance tower. Microtopographic type appears to be the most important variable explaining the variability in respiration rates, and low-center polygons and polygon troughs show the greatest cumulative respiration rates, possibly linked to their deeper thaw depth and higher plant biomass. Regardless of the differences in absolute respiration rates, Q(10) is surprisingly similar across all microtopographic features, possibly indicating a similar temperature limitation to decomposition across the landscape. Q(10) was higher during the colder early summer and lower during the warmer peak growing season, consistent with an elevated temperature sensitivity under colder conditions. The respiration measured by the chambers and the estimates from the daytime flux-partitioned eddy covariance data were within uncertainties during early and peak seasons but overestimated respiration later in the growing season. Overall, this study suggests that it is possible to simplify estimates of the temperature sensitivity of respiration across heterogeneous landscapes but that seasonal changes in Q(10) should be incorporated into model simulations.					; Yanfei, Tang/JEC-0784-2023; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010	Gioli, Beniamino/0000-0001-7631-2623; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2018	123	7					2287	2302		10.1029/2017JG004227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JG004227													WOS:000450067500018

Low downstream dispersal of young-of-year common carp from marshes into lakes in the Upper Mississippi River region and its implications for integrated pest management strategies	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												In lakes of the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB), invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio) employ a reproductive strategy in which adults migrate out of lakes to spawn in seasonally unstable marshes that have few egg and larval predators. The rates with which the juveniles outmigrate from marshes into adjacent lakes have critical management implications but have not been quantified using direct approaches. We used passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to quantify outmigration of young-of-year (YOY) carp from marshes into lakes in two systems in UMRB. In both cases, marshes were located upstream of lakes and PIT antennas continuously monitored the movement of carp. In the first system, which we monitored for three years, 0.2% to 5.5% of PIT-tagged YOY carp outmigrated to the lake each year; highest outmigration occurred during mid-summer periods of low water level in the marsh. In the second system, which comprised much more extensive area of deeper marshes, 0.2% of YOY carp outmigrated to the lake. Ageing and mark-recapture analyses confirmed that relatively few YOY carp recruited into the lake populations from the marshes each year (between 5 and 50 per hectare). Our results show that YOY carp outmigration rates are low (< 6%) but can vary an order of magnitude among years. These findings are important for removal-based management strategies for carp in lakes of UMRB by showing what adult removal rates are needed to compensate for juvenile recruitment from marshy nurseries.																			1989-8649					NOV	2017	8	4					485	495		10.3391/mbi.2017.8.4.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2017.8.4.03													WOS:000412583100003

Apple orchard phenology response to desiccation and temperature changes in Urmia Lake region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Agricultural production activities, such as those for various fruits and cereals, play a significant role in the local economy and food security of the Urmia Lake region. In particular, this region has thousands of hectares of apple orchards, which have an important socioeconomic impact on the life of people. Climate and land cover changes over the past several decades threaten the apple orchards phenology (AOP). Recent studies have emphasized the effect of temperature on plant phenology; however, they have overlooked the influence of land cover changes, such as Lake Desiccation, on plant phenology. Meanwhile, how climate change and Lake Desiccation will affect the AOP is still not very well understood. Therefore, in this study, we used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) extracted from remote sensing images acquired by the MODIS sensor spanning from 2003 to 2014, in order to extract the AOP events. Furthermore, we used a random forest regression (RFR) for analyzing the relationship between temperature changes/Lake Desiccation and AOP. The results revealed that EVI is a very useful tool for estimating the AOP with a mean root-mean-square error of 6.25 days. Moreover, there is a linear trend toward the early start of season in this region. The end of season (EOS) and the growing season length have also increased in the areas closer to the lake until 2008. This seems that the delayed EOS in the area closest to Urmia Lake has been associated with the lake microclimate since 2008.					; Homayouni, Saeid/AAL-4959-2020; Rezaei-Chiyaneh, Esmaeil/V-3181-2018	Rezaie-Chiyaneh, Esmaeil/0000-0002-6208-3740; Homayouni, Saeid/0000-0002-0214-5356													1735-1472	1735-2630				SEP	2017	14	9					1865	1878		10.1007/s13762-017-1283-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1283-5													WOS:000408447000004

Since the last glacial, limnotelmatic and pure telmatic conditions, controlled mainly by karstic springs and partly by surface waters, favoured peat formation in the basin, resulting in the accumulation of a peat deposit up to 15 m thick. The present fen occupies a large area of almost 9 km2. Flora cover comprises mainly Cyperaceae (Cladium mariscus and Carex species), while Phragmites australis extend along the banks of a river flowing through the basin, as well as around a lake in the southern part of the fen.

The Nissi peatland shows many genetic similarities to the Philippi peat deposit, Eastern Macedonia. and may be considered as a recent analogue to the lignite deposits in the basins of Ptolemais, Western Macedonia and Megalopolis, the Peloponnese.

The role of flooding on inter-annual and seasonal variability of lake water chemistry, phytoplankton diatom communities and macrophyte biomass in the Slave River Delta (Northwest Territories, Canada)	ECOHYDROLOGY												Water chemistry. macrophyte biomass and planktonic diatom communities were monitored seasonally over 3 years (2003-2005) from six hydrologically diverse lakes to assess the role of river flooding, on inter-annual and seasonal variability of conditions in lakes of the Slave River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada. Results indicate that river flooding, was the dominant hydrological process controlling the temporal dynamics of the physical and chemical conditions, planktonic diatom communities and macrophyte biomass in lakes of the Slave River Delta. In the absence of river flooding,,. lakes had relatively high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of most ions, but when flooded, concentrations of nutrients decreased and ions increased. The physical and chemical conditions in frequently, flooded and non-flooded lakes were relatively stable from year to year, whereas lakes that were intermittently flooded fluctuated widely depending oil whether or not the flooded. Spring flooding from the Slave River introduced planktonic, centric diatoms that persisted only for a few Weeks in the water column before settling out. Non-flooded lakes lacked planktonic diatoms. River flooding also reduced water transparency, which decreased macrophyte biomass, while lakes that did not flood exhibited higher macrophyte biomass and clear waters. This research provides insights into the factors that control file hydroecological variability of northern deltaic landscapes, and further improves Our understanding of the complex interactions among hydrology, limnology and aquatic ecology, ultimately contributing to an improved scientific basis for future resource management decisions in the Slave River Delta and analogous systems.

Problems and pitfalls in using HPLC pigment analysis to distinguish Lake Michigan phytoplankton taxa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become a standard for analysis of phytoplankton pigment in marine and freshwaters. In marine systems, such data have been combined with optimization algorithms (e.g., CHEMTAX) to quantitatively predict the taxa present in a given sample; such studies are less common in freshwaters, particularly in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes. HPLC/CHEMTAX methods were compared with taxonomic identification and quantification using traditional microscopy and volume to chlorophyll a conversions in Lake Michigan phytoplankton communities collected on six cruises during summer (June to August) 2008. Chlorophyll a reached maxima (approximately 1.5 mu g L-1 nearshore and 0.5 mu g L-1 offshore) in late June/early July, with the exception of the offshore metalimnion where chlorophyll a peaked (3.0 mu g L-1) in early July. Taxonomic groups were consistently misidentified by HPLC/CHEMTAX, relative to microscope methods; of 18 points of comparisons, only 5 were significantly related (judged by regression of relative proportion of chlorophyll a estimated by HPLC/CHEMTAX versus cell counts/volume). Confusion between diatoms and chrysophytes was particularly serious. For example, in late July when counts indicated that biovolume at epilimnetic stations was dominated by diatoms, HPLC/CHEMTAX indicated dominance by chrysophytes. Grouping diatoms and chrysophytes as a single taxon improved comparisons, so that there was significant agreement in 7 out of 18 cases. While some specific improvement to the HPLC method (e.g., selecting a smaller subset of pigments relevant to the specific phytoplankton assemblages found) might help, our work emphasizes the point made repeatedly in the literature, that HPLC methods cannot replace microscopy.

Available techniques including satellite monitoring and phenological observations enable the detection of changes over the last few decades to centuries, but the full range of natural variability is still difficult to capture. Here we introduce a new approach to reconstruct growing season properties, by studying imprints of prolonged growing season on epidermal cell growth in Betula nana. A high correlation between cell expansion determined in annually collected B. nana leaves and subfossil leaf fragments collected from recent peat sections in northern Scandinavia, and climatic indices such as budburst date, growing-season degree-days and May September mean temperatures, enable the establishment of a new micro-phenological proxy for growing season characteristics. The applicability of the epidermal cell undulation index (UI) is tested by comparison with historical instrumental records of growing-season degree-days for the last 200 a. The results demonstrate the potential of the new leaf-morphology-based technique to reconstruct and quantify past changes in growing degree-days beyond instrumental data series. Applied to abundant B. nana leaf remains from peat and lake sediments, the UI may enable a reconstruction of growing degree-days throughout the Holocene and other parts of the late Quaternary.

J	Jin, ML; Mcbroom, DG				Jin, Menglin; Mcbroom, Douglas G.			Investigating Road Ice Formation Mechanisms Using Road Weather Information System (RWIS) Observations	CLIMATE												Ice formation on roads leads to a higher incidence of accidents and increases winter de-icing/anti-icing costs. This study analyzed 3 years (2019-2021) of Road Weather Information System (RWIS) sub-hourly measurements collected by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) to understand the first-order factors of road ice formation and its mechanisms. First, road ice is formed only when the road pavement surface temperature is equal to or below the freezing point (i.e., 32 degrees F (i.e., 0 degrees C)), while the corresponding 2 m air temperature could be above 32 degrees F. Nevertheless, when the road pavement was below 32 degrees F ice often did not form on the roads. Therefore, one challenge is to know under what conditions road ice forms. Second, the pavement surface temperature is critical for road ice formation. The clear road (i.e., with no ice or snow) surface pavement temperature is generally warmer than the air temperature during both day and night. This feature is different from a natural land surface, where the land skin temperature is lower than the air temperature on cloud-free nights due to radiative cooling. Third, subsurface temperature, measured using a RWIS subsurface sensor below a road surface, did not vary as much as the pavement temperature and, thus, may not be a good index for road ice formation. Fourth, urban heat island effects lead to black ice formation more frequently than roads located in other regions. Fifth, evaporative cooling from the water surface near a road segment further reduces the outlying air temperature, a mechanism that increases heat loss for bridges or lake-side roads in addition to radiative cooling. Additionally, mechanical lifting via mountains and hills is also an efficient mechanism that makes the air condense and, consequently, form ice on the roads. Forecasting road ice formation is in high demand for road safety. These observed features may help to develop a road ice physical model consisting of functions of hyper-local weather conditions, local domain knowledge, the road texture, and geographical environment.																				2225-1154				MAY	2024	12	5							63	10.3390/cli12050063	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli12050063													WOS:001232630900001

We reconstructed temperature changes using Pediastrum species data, verified by clumped isotopes (Delta(47)), in the carbonates of sediment cores recovered from Bosten Lake in Xinjiang Province, northwestern China. Combined with archaeological data, the results indicate an unusually warm climatic interval that peaked at similar to 4.7-4.3 kyr and promoted human occupation of the Altai Mountains. The climate cooled during 4.2-4.1 kyr and 3.6-3.5 kyr, as indicated by the decrease or absence of Pediastrum simplex. These cold events may have triggered the southward human migration out of the Altai region, resulting in the widespread distribution of archaeological sites at lower latitudes, in the Tienshan Mountains, and in the desert-oasis areas of the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang. Our data support the notion that a series of cultural transitions across the monsoonal Loess Plateau and Tibetan Plateau of China may have been linked to temperature changes during the middle to late Holocene.

An innovative web crawler tool was employed to help critically synthesize the information in the literature. The literature suggests that climate change will impact nutrient dynamics around the globe and exacerbate contemporary water-quality challenges. Nutrient leaching and overland flow transport are projected to increase globally, promoted by extreme precipitation. Seasonal variations in stream flow are expected to emulate changing precipitation patterns, but the specific local impacts of climate change on hydrology and nutrient dynamics will vary both seasonally and regionally. Plant activity may reduce some of this load in nonagricultural soils if the expected increase in plant uptake of nutrients prompted by increased temperatures can compensate for greater nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization, N deposition, and leaching rates. High-temperature forest and grass fires may help reduce mineralization and microbial turnover by altering N speciation via the pyrolysis of organic matter. In agricultural areas that are at higher risk of erosion, extreme precipitation will exacerbate existing water-quality issues, and greater plant nutrient uptake may lead to an increase in fertilizer use. Future urban expansion will amplify these effects. Higher ambient temperatures will promote harmful cyanobacterial blooms by enhancing thermal stratification, increasing nutrient load into streams and lakes from extreme precipitation events, decreasing summer flow and thus baseflow dilution capacity, and increasing water and nutrient residence times during increasingly frequent droughts. Land management decisions must consider the nuanced regional and seasonal changes identified in this review (realized and predicted). Such knowledge is critical to increasing international cooperation and accelerating action toward the United Nations's global sustainability goals and the specific objectives of the Conference of Parties (COP) 26.

J	Harris, PD; Branney, MJ; Storey, M				Harris, Pablo Davila; Branney, Michael J.; Storey, Michael			Large eruption-triggered ocean-island landslide at Tenerife: Onshore record and long-term effects on hazardous pyroclastic dispersal	GEOLOGY												An extensive debris-avalanche deposit has been discovered on Canadas volcano, Tenerife (Canary Islands). The onshore component of the 733 +/- 3 ka Abona landslide deposit exposes classic block facies and mixed facies across 90 km(2). Three lines of evidence together show that the avalanche was triggered by an ignimbrite-forming explosive eruption: (1) the deposit is enclosed by phonolitic ignimbrites and is draped by a Plinian fallout layer, all within a single eruption unit; (2) it contains prismatic-jointed pumice blocks that were hot during landslide emplacement, indicated by chilled rims and breadcrust surfaces; (3) these blocks yield the same 40Ar/39Ar date as the associated ignimbrite and fall deposit. Landslide hummocks dammed surface water, forming ephemeral lakes perched on the volcano flank. Phonolite dome growth destabilized the southeast sector of a mid-Pleistocene Canadas caldera wall, and created a major breach that affected the passage of destructive pyroclastic density currents on Tenerife for 0.5 m.y., showing that landslides can have enduring consequences for pyroclastic dispersal and hazards.					; Storey, Meredith/N-8816-2015; Harris, Pablo/H-4148-2019; Davila Harris, Pablo/C-7891-2013	Branney, Michael/0000-0002-9126-7178; Davila Harris, Pablo/0000-0002-0620-5459; Storey, Michael/0000-0002-3126-4637													0091-7613	1943-2682				OCT	2011	39	10					951	954		10.1130/G31994.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G31994.1													WOS:000294818700014

Long-Term Trends in Cloud and Rain Chemistry on Mount Washington, New Hampshire	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Growing season rain and cloud events were sampled between 1984-2010 at Lakes of the Clouds (LOC) (1,540 m above sea level (ASL)) which is 1.6 km SW of the summit of Mount Washington, NH (1,914 m ASL). Mount Washington's summit is in the clouds ca. 51 % of the time. All samples were measured for pH, while cations and anions were measured consistently from 1996 to 2010. Annual mean cloud and rain water hydrogen ion concentrations declined significantly from 1984-2010. Nighttime cloud and rain hydrogen, sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate ion concentrations were significantly greater compared to daytime. Ion mean concentrations declined over the 1996-2010 timeframe and more rapidly since 2005. Co-located filter-based aerosol measurement (PM2.5) at LOC had higher ratios of ammonium to sulfate in summer daytime samples post (1995-2010) full implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. This suggests a shift towards more neutralized sulfate aerosol dissolution into clouds with relatively more ammonium and declines in acidity. The origin of cloud water sampled, which ranges from regional fronts to orographic lower elevation air mass uplift, along with the diurnally shifting nocturnal boundary layer that often puts the LOC site in and out of the mixed layer, likely contributes to the diurnal and inter-annual variability observed.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2013	224	9							1653	10.1007/s11270-013-1653-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1653-7													WOS:000323644600010

We show that, during the last decade (2000s), atmospheric and sea surface temperatures are reaching levels last encountered millennia ago, when northern high latitude summer insolation was higher due to a different orbital configuration. Records from lake sediments in southern Greenland document major environmental and climatic conditions during the last 10,000 years, highlighting the role of soil dynamics in past vegetation changes, and stressing the growing anthropogenic impacts on soil erosion during the recent decades. Furthermore, past and present changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat advection appear to strongly influence both regional climate and ice sheet dynamics. Projections from climate models are investigated to quantify the magnitude and rates of future changes in Greenland temperature, which may be faster than past abrupt events occurring under interglacial conditions. Within one century, in response to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, Greenland may reach temperatures last time encountered during the last interglacial period, approximately 125,000 years ago. We review and discuss whether analogies between the last interglacial and future changes are reasonable, because of the different seasonal impacts of orbital and greenhouse gas forcings. Over several decades to centuries, future Greenland melt may act as a negative feedback, limiting regional warming albeit with global sea level and climatic impacts.

Holocene and Last Interglacial cloudiness in eastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This study presents Last Interglacial and Holocene vegetation and climate changes at Fog Lake (67 degrees 11'N, 63 degrees 15'W) on eastern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada. The vegetation cover is reported as vegetation structural types (or biomes). July air temperature and sunshine during the growing season (June-July-August-September) were reconstructed from pollen assemblages using the modern analogue technique. The vegetation of the Last Interglacial period evolved from a prostrate dwarf-shrub tundra to a low- and high-shrub tundra vegetation. The succession of four Arctic biomes was distinguished from the Last Interglacial sediments, whereas only one Arctic biome was recorded in the Holocene sediments. From ca. 8300 cal. years BP to present, hemiprostrate dwarf-shrub tundra occupied the soils around Fog Lake. During the Last Interglacial, growing season sunshine was higher than during the Holocene and July air temperature was 4 to 5 degrees C warmer than present. A principal component analysis helped in assessing relationship between floristic gradients and climate. The major vegetation changes through the Last Interglacial and Holocene were driven by July air temperature variations, whereas the minor, or subtle, vegetation changes seem rather correlated to September sunshine. This study demonstrates that growing season sunshine conditions can be reconstructed from Arctic pollen assemblages, thus providing information on feedbacks associated with cloud cover and summer temperatures, and therefore growing season length.					de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013	de Vernal, Anne/0000-0001-5656-724X; Frechette, Bianca/0000-0002-4986-5772													0008-4077	1480-3313				NOV	2008	45	11					1221	1234		10.1139/E08-053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E08-053													WOS:000265847200003

In order to assess this change, phytoplankton genera were identified and counted during two representative periods, 1987-88 (before zebra mussel invasion) and 1993-94 (after invasion) and major groups in 1995 and 1996. Average cell density of phytoplankton declined similar to 17-fold from 25.6 X 10(6) cells l(-1) before invasion to 1.5 X 10(6) cells l(-1) after invasion. Dominance of the phytoplankton (by cell density, assessed on an annual scale) shifted from cyanobacteria before the invasion to diatoms during the invasion; cyanobacterial density decreased 778-fold and diatoms decreased by a factor of only 2.5. Samples from 1995 and 1996, counted only to class, confirm the patterns from the more detailed counts in 1993 and 1994: a major decline in cell numbers and a dramatic decline in cyanobacteria relative to diatoms. The taxonomic composition of assemblages based on relative abundances of both genera and divisions showed significant shifts from colonial and unicellular cyanobacteria to large, colonial or benthic diatoms. Also, the large decline in cyanobacteria and some diatom genera, which had been abundant in late summer, dampened the seasonal variation in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton following the zebra mussel invasion.

Intensity of haemosporidian infection of parids positively correlates with proximity to water bodies, but negatively with host survival	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												In birds, haemosporidian parasites have been found to have direct pathogenic effects on the host with important consequences for their fitness. However, less is known about distribution patterns of parasite vectors, which may significantly affect parasite prevalence, infection intensity and, thus, pathogenicity in hosts. Here, we tested for relationships between infection intensity, survival, predation and distance from water bodies of mixed-species tit flocks. We found that the prevalence of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium infections decreased with increasing distance from forest lakes and bogs outside the bird breeding season. Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites were found to be associated with a low survival rate of willow tits (Poecile montanus) in the vicinity of water bodies, while crested tits (Lophophanes cristatus) were affected only by Haemoproteus. Crested tits, a dominant species of parid social groups, had a lower parasite prevalence and they survived better than the subordinate willow tit. This can be explained by the crested tits foraging higher in the pine canopy as parasite vectors supposedly cannot reach hosts in the upper canopy as equally as in lower parts of the canopy. We show that individuals staying in flocks further from the forest water bodies and spending more time foraging in the upper parts of the canopy have higher chances of survival into the next breeding season. This suggests that different forest and canopy areas may differ in terms of parasite risk and associated mortality. Finally, we found that the infection status of parids increases the probability of predation by the pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum). We conclude that distance from water bodies and foraging location in the forest canopy may affect the intensity of parasite infection with fitness consequences in wintering parids.

J	Dick, C; Puchta, M; Bard, J				Dick, Christian; Puchta, Matthias; Bard, Jochen			StEnSea - Results from the pilot test at Lake Constance	JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE												Storing energy offshore by means of hollow concrete spheres placed at the bottom of the sea is a very attractive solution to combine technical features of conventional pumped hydro storage systems with a huge resource potential around the globe in an economic way. However, the design, construction and installation of large concrete spheres as well as the required electro-mechanical equipment such as pump turbines and controls require R&D at system and component level as well as for the offshore logistics and grid integration. In a first scaled test using a 3 m diameter sphere a fully functional automated system has been developed, installed and tested in about 100 m water depth in Lake Constance in the South of Germany through the winter period of 2016/2017. This paper addresses the experimental work and results as well as the design and logistics in-vestigations towards full scale systems. A short outlook is provided for the next development phase currently under negotiation with funding agencies.																				2352-152X				OCT	2021	42								103083	10.1016/j.est.2021.103083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.103083		AUG 2021											WOS:000701905800002
J	Yu, SM; Liu, JS; Yuan, JG				Yu Shu-mei; Liu Jing-shi; Yuan Jin-guo			Vegetation Change of Yamzho Yumco Basin in Southern Tibet Based on SPOT-VGT NDVI	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												The area we studied is Lake Yamzho Yumco Basin (28 degrees 27'-29 degrees 12'N, 90 degrees 08'-91 degrees 45'E), the largest inland lake basin in southern Tibetan Plateau, China. Using the SPOT-VGT NDVI vegetation index from 1998 to 2007 in the basin, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of NDVI and its correlation with the major climatic factors (air temperature, precipitation) were analyzed. The results show that the average NDVI of the lake basin ranges from 0.12 to 0.31 and its seasonal change is obvious; the NDVI begins to rise rapidly in May and reaches the maximum value in early September. The average NDVI of the basin shows the slow increasing trend during 1998 to 2007, and it indicates that the eco-environment of the basin is recovering. The high value of NDVI has close relationships with water supply, altitude and vegetation types, so NDVI is relatively high near water sources and is the highest in meadow grassland. The summer air temperature and precipitation are the important climate elements that influence the vegetation in the basin, and the linear correlation coefficients between NDVI and air temperature and precipitation are 0.7 and 0.71, respectively. In recent years, warm and humid trend of the local climate is prevailing to improve the ecological environment in YamzhoYumco Basin.																			1000-0593					JUN	2010	30	6					1570	1574		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)06-1570-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)06-1570-05								20707152					WOS:000278580200028

On the radiocesium carbonate barrier in organics-rich sediments of Lake Juodis, Lithuania	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Radiocesium vertical profiles in organics-rich sediments of running shallow eutrophic Lake Juodis (Lithuania) were studied in relation to seasonal variations of vertical profiles (in water column and sedi ments) of standard variables (pH, redox potential, temperature, oxygen concentrations, conductivity). It is shown that the sedimentation rate, radiocesium mobility and its vertical profiles in sediments are controlled by the vital cycle (processes of the growth, accumulation and decomposition) of green algae covering the main bottom areas of the lake. It is also shown that calcite deposits are formed in the shallow bottom areas that are oxygenated throughout the year because of the photosynthetic activity of the green algae covering the sediment. Formation of the calcite coatings on freshly accumulated organics is remarkable for causing elevated densities of sediment solids in the upper part of the respective vertical profiles. These calcite deposits behave as a barrier for radiocesium backward flux to the bottom water making the respective bottom areas a radionuclide sink. Together with the jelly-structured sediments lying below these deposits, the calcite preserves the shape of the primary radiocesium vertical profiles formed due to free-ion diffusion after the deposition event. It was determined that bottom areas anaerobic in winter are the main radiocesium source in the water column and cause characteristic radiocesium redistribution in surface sediments.

Winter Arctic Outflow Winds Cause Upper Ocean Cooling and Reoxygenation in a Temperate Canadian Fjord	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic outflow winds bring cold air from the continent to the coastline through mountain passes. Using observational data and a 2-D model, we show that a February 2019 outflow event caused the upper 100 m in Bute Inlet, British Columbia (within the traditional territory of the Homalco Nation) to cool up to 1.9 & DEG;C and gain up to 4.1 mLL(-1) of oxygen. The cold, oxygenated water persisted for almost 1 year within the 1,023-1,023.5 kgm(-3) isopycnal range (& SIM;50-150 m). Atmospheric (from 1929 to 2022) and oceanographic (from 1951 to 2022) data showed a statistically significant relationship between continental air temperature at Tatlayoko Lake and temperature and oxygen in Bute Inlet. This local mechanism that counters some effects of climate change could create a biological refugium as surrounding waters warm and lose oxygen at a faster rate. The number of outflow events decreased from 1951 to 2018, and increased since.					; Klymak, Jody/A-3041-2008; Evans, Wiley/U-8250-2018	Holmes, Keith/0000-0001-8796-8222; Jackson, Jennifer/0000-0002-2318-8814; Klymak, Jody/0000-0003-4612-8600; Evans, Wiley/0000-0002-5450-0903; Bianucci, Laura/0000-0002-4492-8930; Hannah, Charles/0000-0002-0238-5683													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2023	50	16							e2023GL104549	10.1029/2023GL104549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104549													WOS:001057449300001

Salmonidae and associated coldwater species	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We present distributional maps and discuss native status for fish species characteristic of coldwater lakes, sampled from 203 randomly selected lakes in the northeastern USA (New England, New York, New Jersey). Eleven coldwater fish species from four families (Salmonidae, Osmeridae, Gadidae, Cottidae) were collected during the summers of 1991 to 1996 by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). The most widespread species were brook trout and rainbow smelt, collected at 23% and 18% of the sampled lakes, respectively. Stocked (put-and-take) rainbow trout occurred at 10% of the lakes, while the remaining fish species (brown trout, landlocked Atlantic salmon, lake trout, Arctic char, lake whitefish, cisco, burbot, slimy sculpin) were collected at less than 6% of the lakes. We also provide comparative data on physical (surface area, depth, elevation), chemical (pH and total phosphorus), and watershed characteristics of the lakes where these species were collected.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2001	8	2					189	206																WOS:000174240300006

A Late Pleistocene-Holocene wetland megafan in the Brazilian Amazonia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Despite the growing interest in megafans, definitions provided for this type of environmental setting have not yet been widely agreed upon. A record of sedimentary fades distribution in both space and time including a larger number of analogs is particularly needed for improving megafan facies models. This work focuses on a large fan-like feature from an Amazonian wetland in northern Brazil. Morphological data based on remote sensing, as well as sedimentary facies and radiocarbon analyses, were integrated to propose that this feature is related to a megafan system active during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. The megafan displays a divergent drainage network, gently-dipping slope, and concave-up and convex-up longitudinal and transverse profiles, respectively. Near surface deposits correspond to fining and coarsening upward sands related to active channels and overbank sand sheets/terminal fan lobes. Sediments are interbedded with abandoned channel/floodplain and lake/pond muds. Morphostructural analyses and drainage anomalies revealed a geological setting affected by reactivation of pre-existing faults contemporaneous with sediment accumulation. Establishment of a megafan system in this wetland most likely occurred within a slightly tectonically subsiding basin under favorable climatic conditions. During wet seasons, high water discharge would have favored sediment transport from highlands into this depositional site. High summer temperatures and drought under a monsoonal regime kept the water levels low. The described megafan could serve as an analog for contemporary tropical wetland megafans formed under a monsoonal climate regime. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the current study, a combination of two machine learning techniques namely K-means, and decision tree (C4.5) algorithms, are used to separate observed precipitation into clusters and classified the associated large-scale circulation indices. Observed precipitation from the Chinese Meteorological Agency (CMA) during 1961-2016 for 83 stations in the Poyang Lake basin (PLB) is used. The results from K-Means clusters show two precipitation clusters splitting the PLB precipitation into a northern and southern cluster, with a silhouette coefficient similar to 0.5. The PLB precipitation leading cluster (C1) contains 48 stations accounting for 58% of the regional station density, while Cluster 2 (C2) covers 35, accounting for 42% of the stations. The interannual variability in precipitation exhibited significant differences for both clusters. The decision tree (C4.5) is employed to explore the large-scale atmospheric indices from National Climate Center (NCC) associated with each cluster during the preceding spring season as a predictor. The C1 precipitation was linked with the location and intensity of subtropical ridgeline position over Northern Africa, whereas the C2 precipitation was suggested to be associated with the Atlantic-European Polar Vortex Area Index. The precipitation anomalies further validated the results of both algorithms. The findings are in accordance with previous studies conducted globally and hence recommend the applications of machine learning techniques in atmospheric science on a sub-regional and sub-seasonal scale. Future studies should explore the dynamics of the K-Means, and C4.5 derived indicators for a better assessment on a regional scale. This research based on machine learning methods may bring a new solution to climate forecast.					; Ullah, Waheed/Q-7552-2019	Ullah, Waheed/0000-0002-0626-0650; chai, yuanfang/0000-0003-4781-0812; Wang, Guojie/0000-0002-8613-0003; 														2073-4433				JUL	2021	12	7							834	10.3390/atmos12070834	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12070834													WOS:000675901900001

Alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, is an exemplary species to study reciprocal feedbacks between ecology and evolution, owing to repeated independent derivations of a landlocked life history from an ancestral anadromous form. In this study we analysed the reproductive allocation during the spawning season in a landlocked Alewife population in the context of eco-evolutionary feedbacks. We also compared our findings with previous results from a neighbouring anadromous population of the species. Similarities were found between the two Alewife populations in relation to their ovarian development, oocyte release strategy and fecundity type, but also differences in seasonal patterns of energy investment. Anadromous Alewives invested more in the size of the first oocyte batch of the season and subsequently tapered their reproductive allocation, while spawning batch in landlocked Alewife was invariant as the spawning season progressed. The evolutionary change from ancestral tapering to equitability of seasonal reproductive investment can be explained with reference to eco-evolutionary changes that occurred upon landlocking related to the availability of zooplankton prey and feeding opportunity.

"BAIKAL-5D" was installed during the 2020 winter expedition at a depth of 1250 m. To carry out the optical measurements, we use a device with a shaded point-like isotropic light source having a spectral resolution of about 3 nm. A wide angle light receiver is moved by a stepper motor so that the distance between the receiver and the light source can vary from 0.9m to 7.4 m. The absorption and scattering lengths were measured every week in 6 spectral points. The short-time variation of absorption length was estimated.

Twenty to twenty-five centimeter thick cores that were cut into four centimeter segments were analyzed to study the variation of concentration of radionuclide with increase in depth. This investigation shows that concentrations of radionuclide either remains constant or slightly decrease with increase in depth of the sediments. It further suggests that slightly higher levels of concentration close to the surface could be due to the new releases of the nuclides from coal fired power plant,and or which represents fall out from nuclear test weapons or industrialization.																			1077-1204						1993	28	5					1005	1015		10.1080/10934529309375926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529309375926													WOS:A1993LD83700004

To evaluate Ca transformations, the water column was monitored for a number of pertinent water-quality parameters, and sediment traps were used to collect particulate material that settled from the epilimnion. Thermodynamic calculations indicated that the epilimnion of Onondaga Lake was oversaturated with respect to the solubility of CaCO3 (pKso = 8.48) for the entire period of summer stratification. The extent of oversaturation with respect to the solubility of CaCO3, and particulate Ca deposition, was significantly correlated with primary productivity. In-lake formation of CaCO3 not only influenced Ca transport but also enhanced the downward transport of P and organic carbon, and contributed to light attenuation.

Little is known about the impact of these climatic changes on Alpine ecosystems due to the sparsity of undisturbed sediment records in the Alps and their foreland. In this study, multiple sediment-archived proxies (sediment geochemistry, stable oxygen and carbon isotopes of autochthonous carbonate, and subfossil remains of macrophytes and aquatic invertebrates) were examined in five drill cores from an ancient inner-Alpine lake at Unterangerberg (Eastern Alps) to reconstruct the palaeolake environment and to estimate summer temperature changes for the first half of MIS 3. The lacustrine sedimentation in the basin began ca. 54.6 ka, tentatively correlated with the start of Greenland Interstadial (GI) 14. We identified three distinct phases in the development of the lake. (1) A cold, oligotrophic water body influenced by snow/glacier meltwater ca. 54.6-52.2 cal ka BP. (2) A clear-water, macrophyte-dominated, productive lake ca. 52.2-44.9 cal ka BP. Submerged macrophytes were dominated by the charophyte alga Chara hispida and chironomid assemblages - by Corynocera ambigua, which is absent from the present-day fauna of the Alpine region. (3) A turbid-water, less productive lake ca. 44.9-41.5 cal ka BP. This shift towards a turbid-water state, as evidenced by the drastic reduction in the abundance of submerged macrophytes and associated invertebrates, likely occurred due to increased input of meltwater. The regime shift is tentatively correlated with the start of GI 11, for which the highest temperatures of the studied MIS 3 interval are inferred. Chironomid-based reconstructions of mean July air temperatures provide interstadial temperature estimates between ca. 11 and 12.5 degrees C (i.e. ca. 5-6 degrees C below present-day values), which concurs with reconstructions available from the northern Alpine foreland. Cooler July temperatures (ca. 9-10 degrees C) are reconstructed for MIS 3 stadials. The Unterangerberg lacustrine records provide valuable new insights into MIS 3 climate dynamics inside the Eastern Alps and contribute to a better understanding of the effects of climate change on the Alpine environment.

Here we evaluate the atmospheric deposition, storage and release of total Hg (THg) and monomethyl mercury (MeHg) on Penny ice cap, Baffin Island. This is the first such study in the Baffin region. THg levels in snow and firn (mean = 0.61 ng L-1) are comparable to those on High Arctic glaciers but MeHg levels are noticeably higher (mean = 0.11 ng L-1). We find little evidence of springtime enhancement of Hg deposition in snow attributable to atmospheric mercury depletion events. Estimated accumulation rates of THg and MeHg in firn are similar to 0.33 and 0.03 mu g m(-2) a(-1), higher than on High Arctic glaciers, possibly due to higher precipitation on southern Baffin Island. The estimated net annual release of THg by glacial snow and ice melt is small (THg: 1.86 kg; MeHg: 0.18 kg). In the study area, geogenic Hg contributions from sediment-loaded glacial meltwater could be as large or larger than those from melting ice. MeHg levels are very low in meltwater-fed streams and lakes (<= 0.01 ng L-1), suggesting that MeHg is released early in the snowmelt season and/or quickly removed from meltwater by various processes. Summer melt and percolation on Penny ice cap remobilise Hg in firn after deposition, and this imposes resolution limits of at least 3 years on depositional trends inferred from ice cores.

J	Rhodes, EM; Liburd, OE; England, GK				Rhodes, Elena M.; Liburd, Oscar E.; England, Gary K.			Effects of Southern Highbush Blueberry Cultivar and Treatment Threshold on Flower Thrips Populations	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												In Florida, southern highbush (SHB) blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L. X Vaccinium darrowi Camp) are grown for a highly profitable early season fresh market. Flower thrips are the key pest of SHB blueberries, and Frankliniella bispinosa (Morgan) is the most common species found. Flower thrips injure blueberry flowers by feeding and ovipositing in all developing tissues. These injuries can lead to scarring of developing fruit. The objectives of this study were to determine the relationship between thrips and yield in different SHB blueberry cultivars and to determine an action threshold. Experiments were conducted during early spring 2007 and 2008 on four farms; a research farm in Citra, FL; and three commercial farms, two in Hernando Co., FL., and one in Lake Co., FL. At the Citra farm, 'Emerald', 'Jewel', 'Millennia', and 'Star' blueberries were compared in 2007, and all but Star were compared in 2008. On the Hernando and Lake Co. farms, two treatment thresholds (100 and 200 thrips per trap) and an untreated control and four cultivars (Emerald, Jewel, Millennia, and 'Windsor') were compared. Emerald consistently had more thrips per trap and per flower than the other cultivars on all four farms. However, this did not always lead to an increase in fruit injury. Thrips numbers exceeded the threshold on only one farm in 2007, and there was a significantly lower proportion of injured and malformed fruit in the 100 thrips per trap threshold treatment compared with the control on this farm.																			0022-0493					APR	2012	105	2					480	489		10.1603/EC11265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC11265								22606818					WOS:000302784300023
J	Weng, CY; Jackson, ST				Weng, CY; Jackson, ST			Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation history and paleoclimate of the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sediment cores spanning the last 13,500 calendar years (cal yr) were obtained from two lakes (Fracas Lake, 2518 m; Bear Lake, 2778 m) on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona. Pollen and plant macrofossil records indicate that before similar to 12,900 cal yr B.P., high elevation landscapes of the Kaibab Plateau near Bear Lake were covered by alpine tundra, while lower elevations near Fracas Lake were occupied by Picea woodland. At similar to 12,900 cal yr B.P., Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa forest expanded upward to occupy the top of the plateau. Pinus ponderosa arrived near Fracas Lake 11,000 cal yr B.P., replacing Picea forests. Since then, Pinus ponder osa forest has dominated the Fracas Lake area. Pinus ponderosa did not appear at Bear Lake until similar to 9730 cal yr B.P. Mixed forests of Picea (mainly Picea pungens), Abies lasiocarpa, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga (after similar to 8000 cal yr B.P.) grew near Bear Lake for the remainder of the Holocene. Picea engelmannii populations reexpanded near Bear Lake after 4000 cal yr B.P. Charcoal records indicate that fire probably helped Pinus ponderosa to become established near Bear Lake. Climate changes on the Kaibab Plateau since the Late Glacial were inferred from lake levels and vegetation patterns. The Late Glacial (>11,000 cal yr B.P.) was cold and probably wet. The early Holocene (11,000 to similar to 8000 cal yr B.P.) was cooler than today and may have been the wettest period. Fracas Lake and Bear Lake were probably deepest then. During this period, a strengthened summer monsoon brought in more moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. During the dry and warm mid-Holocene, Fracas Lake and Bear Lake experienced water-level declines. The late Holocene was relatively wet and cool again, and aquatic plants were abundant in the two lakes. Increasing effective moisture in the late Holocene was related to decreasing summer insolation.

Its provision relies on multiple barriers, the first being the protection of source water. Source water refers to the bodies of water (aquifers, rivers, lakes, springs, reservoirs) from which communities and individuals take their drinking water. A large waterborne campylobacter outbreak in 2016 spurred the New Zealand government to make a suite of legislative and policy reforms to strengthen the country's drinking water supply system. However, the nitrate contamination of a municipal drinking water source, and its subsequent breach of drinking water standards, should bring renewed attention to the protection of source water. This article presents a case study of the exceedance and a review of legislation and policy governing drinking water sources. It finds that while important steps have been made since 2016, weaknesses in responsibility and accountability remain in Aotearoa's drinking water supply system.

Migrating birds reorient toward land at dawn over the Great Lakes, USA	AUK												Most landbirds migrate at night and typically make landfall in suitable stopover habitat before dawn. However, when birds find themselves over large water bodies at dawn, they must continue flying into the day and either finish crossing the water body and land on the far shore or backtrack to the near (i.e. first encountered) shore to land. Their collective decisions will influence how migrants are distributed among shoreline stopover habitats on either side of the water crossing. We studied birds during 4 spring migration seasons from 2010 to 2013 in the Great Lakes region, USA. We used 3 weather surveillance radars to observe migrating landbirds' behavior at dawn and subsequent terrestrial distributions during stopover. Mean flight heights over land and water were higher and mean flight directions were more oriented toward the closest shore at dawn when compared to peak migration earlier in the night. The wider the lake crossing, the higher that birds along the lakeshore flew at dawn. Seasonal mean stopover densities of migrants on land within 3 km of shorelines were 48% higher on the near shores of lakes (based on the seasonal mean direction of migration) than on the far shores. There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.584, P< 0.001, n = 358) between the seasonal mean density of birds aloft over water at dawn and the stopover density of birds in adjacent shorelines. Thus, birds over the water at dawn may tend to return to the near shore of the Great Lakes for stopover rather than continuing across the water. As a result, shoreline habitats on the near shores of lakes harbor greater densities of migrants and are thus critical stopover sites for migrating landbirds in the Great Lakes region.					; Buler, Jeffrey/H-3207-2019; Smith, Robert/C-1002-2009	Buler, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2696-847X; 													0004-8038	1938-4254				APR	2017	134	1					193	201		10.1642/AUK-16-123.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-16-123.1													WOS:000392206100018

A total of 172 and 217 soil CO2 efflux measurements were taken at the surface environment of Pululahua and Cuicocha calderas respectively, by means of the "accumulation chamber" method during the summer of 2006 to constrain the total CO2 output from the studied area. Soil CO2 efflux values ranged from non-detectable up to 48.5 and 141.7 g m(-2) d(-1) for Cuicocha and Pululahua calderas respectively. In addition, probability graphs were used to distinguish the existence of different geochemical populations. Sequential Gaussian Simulation was used to construct an average map for 100 simulations and to compute the total CO2 emission at each studied area: 106 and 270 t d(-1) (metric tons per day) for Cuicocha (13.3 km(2)) and Pululahua (27.6 km(2)) volcanoes respectively.

The hydrothermally altered rocks can be divided into the following mineral types: (1) smectite assemblage with iron oxides and hydroxides; (2) smectite assemblage with sulfides (pyrite); (3) kaolinite-metahalloysite assemblage with sulfates, anatase, and boehmite; and (4) siliceous assemblage. The detailed study of the hydrothermally altered rocks allowed us to elucidate some environmental features of modern fossilization and replacement of organic matter with clay minerals, iron oxyhydroxides, and silica. The fossilized microstructures have been described in rocks of the smectite and siliceous assemblages. It has been shown that the pseudobiomorphic (actually, abiogenic) micro- and nannostructures are formed in the moving water of silica deposition zone.																			0024-4902	1608-3229				NOV	2005	40	6					505	520		10.1007/s10987-005-0048-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10987-005-0048-2													WOS:000233380000002
J	Kulie, MS; Milani, L				Kulie, Mark S.; Milani, Lisa			Seasonal variability of shallow cumuliform snowfall: A CloudSat perspective	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Cumuliform snowfall seasonal variability is studied using a multi-year CloudSat snowfall rate and cloud classification retrieval dataset. Microwave radiometer sea ice concentration datasets are also utilized to illustrate the intimate link between oceanic cumuliform snowfall production and decreased sea ice coverage. Three metrics are calculated to illustrate seasonal cumuliform snowfall signatures: (a) cumuliform snowfall frequency of occurrence, (b) mean cumuliform snowfall rate, and (c) fraction of snowfall attributed to cumuliform snowfall events. Distinct seasonal cumuliform snowfall cycles are observed over the Northern Hemispheric oceans. Cumuliform snowfall frequency of occurrence (mean snowfall rate) peaks in months SON (DJF) at most latitudes. Maximum mean cumuliform snowfall rates exceed 300 mm/year in various North Atlantic Ocean locations, with DJF exhibiting the largest areal extent of higher snowfall rates. Cumuliform snow occurrence fraction frequently exceeds 0.5, but regional seasonal sensitivity is observed where transient sea ice coverage exists. Annual snowfall rate fraction attributed to cumuliform snow does not vary appreciably during SON, DJF and MAM north of approximate to 70 degrees N, but seasonal zonal variability is evident south of this latitudinal threshold. Land cumuliform snowfall features do not universally display strong seasonal signals. Southern Hemisphere seasonal results indicate a strong mean cumuliform snowfall rate maximum (minimum) in JJA (DJF) accompanied by a seasonal latitudinal shift in the snowfall rate peak. Maximum regional snowfall rates exceed 300 mm/year over a broader area compared to the Northern Hemisphere. Cumuliform snowfall production is again strongly linked to seasonal sea ice coverage. Southern Hemispheric cumuliform snowfall occurrence and snowfall rate fraction seasonality is not as obvious as in the Northern Hemisphere, but some latitudinal zones experience approximate to 5-20% seasonal variability in these quantities. Typical cumuliform snowfall fractions range from 0.4 to 0.6 in the prominent cumuliform snowfall belt covering most of the Southern Ocean. Some subtle seasonal cumuliform snowfall signatures are observed over Antarctica.

Isotopic Characterization of Precipitation, Inflow, and Outflow of Lake Toba as a First Assessment of Lake Water Balance Study	ATOM INDONESIA												Isotopic characterization of all identified hydrological units in Lake Toba such as precipitation, inflows, outflows, and lake water, as a first assessment of lake water balance study, has been conducted. The isotopic characterization was done through the interpretation of the relationship of delta D and delta O-18 values of collected samples from various water sources and their variations as a function of time and space. Rain water samples were collected from four rain collectors that were installed in the study area in a monthly sampling for a period of 12 months in 2014. Several samples from various water sources i.e., inflow streams, outflows, springs, and lake water, were also collected 2-3 times during this sampling period. From monthly sampling of rain water, local meteoric water line (LMWL) and the equation of elevations versus delta D values have been constructed. Due to the slightly higher temperature in the study area compared with the average temperature on the other parts of the world, the slope of the constructed LMWL is slightly less than the slope of global meteoric water line. Based on the equation of elevations versus delta D values, the elevations of four springs around study area have been identified. From the linear relationship of delta D and delta O-18 values of collected samples from inflow streams, it was found that most of the samples have experienced evaporation process before entering the lake. Due to mixing with other surface water and longer transit time, the delta D and delta O-18 values of those samples from streams in the Sumatran side are more enriched than those samples from streams in the Samosir side. It was also found that lake water has experienced significant evaporation as indicated by the delta D and delta O-18 values that were more enriched than any other samples. The delta D and delta O-18 of Asahan River samples, the only output of Lake Toba, were found to be very close to the delta D and delta O-18 of the lake. This is because almost all water that flowed in Asahan River originated from the lake. (C) 2018 Atom Indonesia.

INLAND WATERS												The worldwide spread of bigheaded carp (Hypophthalmichthys spp.) is considered an ecological threat and problem in many countries. The aim of this study was to consider the likelihood of bigheaded carp reproduction in Lake Balaton and its catchment area (Hungary). The within-year trends of gonadosomatic index values show that female bigheaded carp increase ovary masses from spring until midsummer, after which a decline is typical. This trend may indicate bulk egg release, but the lack of a sharp drop in fecundity (number of eggs in the ovary) values during and after the potential spawning period suggests that a general and considerable ovary evacuation does not likely explain the declining gonadosomatic index values. Rather, it is more probable that female bigheaded carp resorb their eggs, supported by the presence of atretic oocytes in the ovaries after the potential spawning season. In turn, postovulatory follicles were present in the posterior ovary segments of 2 individuals, indicating that mature eggs were released by some females. The evidence of sporadic egg release does not necessarily imply that successful reproduction has occurred, however. The genetic analyses showed remarkable deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within the stock, suggesting that bigheaded carp do not constitute a natural reproductive community in Lake Balaton. Thus, the present bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton likely derives primarily from external origin (i.e., from the surrounding fish ponds).					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019; Vitál, Zoltán/M-8322-2019; Kovács, Balázs/K-9372-2015	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; Kovacs, Balazs/0000-0003-1753-5098; Hliwa, Piotr/0000-0001-5205-608X; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					218	226		10.1080/20442041.2017.1319546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1319546													WOS:000408584600010

Palaeoenvironmental implications of evaporative gaylussite crystals from Lonar Lake, central India	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We have undertaken petrographic, mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic investigations on carbonate minerals found within a 10-m-long core from Lonar Lake, central India, with the aim of evaluating their potential as palaeoenvironmental proxies. The core encompasses the entire Holocene and is the first well-dated high-resolution record from central India. While calcite and/or aragonite were found throughout the core, the mineral gaylussite was found only in two specific intervals (46303890 and 2040560 cal a BP). Hydrochemical and isotope data from inflowing streams and lake waters indicate that evaporitic processes play a dominant role in the precipitation of carbonates within this lake. Isotopic (18O and 13C) studies on the evaporative gaylussite crystals and residual bulk carbonates (calcite) from the long core show that evaporation is the major control on 18O enrichment in both the minerals. However, in case of 13C additional mechanisms, for example methanogenesis (gaylussite) and phytoplankton productivity (calcium carbonate), play an additional important role in some intervals. We also discuss the relevance of our investigation for palaeoclimate reconstruction and late Holocene monsoon variability.

Todd			A deep chlorophyll maximum nourishes benthic filter feeders in the coastal zone of a large clear lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Water column profiles demonstrated that a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the littoral zone of Lake Ontario intersected the benthos during the development of stratification. We hypothesized that elevated food supply near the lake bottom may be nourishing littoral-zone benthic suspension feeders during this time. Chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored at three heights above the lake bottom, together with near-bottom water velocity using down-facing acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), at three coastal stations along a cross-shore transect. Concurrently, growth rates of quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) caged at the lake bottom were compared with mussels suspended 2 m above the bottom. Over a 3-month period beginning April, caged lake-bottom mussels grew rapidly (mean biomass-specific growth rate = 1.08 yr(-1)), while over a 3-month period beginning July, bottom mussels experienced a decrease in biomass (-0.74 yr(-1)). Suspended mussels always grew significantly faster than bottom mussels (2.3 and 2.2 yr(-1) in Apr and Jul experiments, respectively), affirming previously predicted growth inhibition on the lake bottom due to seston depletion. The different growth rate between seasons of the caged-bottom mussels was most likely attributable to differences in near-bottom chlorophyll concentrations. There was significantly higher chlorophyll a concentration near the lake bottom during the April experiment (average of two stations closest to shore = 2.7 mu g L-1) relative to the July experiment (0.21 mu g L-1 at the same stations). We suggest that littoral-zone quagga mussels are nourished during the onset of stratification via development of a DCM.

Reproductive ecology of a relic population of quillwort based on spore germination was studied in an acidified mountain lake in the Czech Republic. In a four-year experiment, we recorded temperature-related temporal changes in micro- and macrospore germination and sporeling establishment in (i) natural in situ conditions in Cerne jezero lake and (ii) in the laboratory at various temperatures. Germination of both micro- and macrospores increased gradually over four consecutive growth seasons. Several annual cohorts of germinating macrospores born together in a sporangium indicate that spores remain viable for up to several years and the formation of a spore bank. Minimum temperature necessary for germination was lower for microspores (6 degrees C) than macrospores (12 degrees C) and this ensured the availability of spermatozoids for the fertilization of the long-living macrogamethophytes whenever they produced archegonia during growing season(s). Macrogametophyte development started between July and October and sporeling development always followed in the next or subsequent springs. Long germination and embryo development may limit reproduction in I. lacustris by making it sensitive to both episodic and chronic changes in the environment. The relatively high minimum temperature for macrospore germination may set general limits for the reproduction of I. lacustris in lakes, by constraining its distribution along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and to particular depths. The mean length of time when the temperature (>= 12 degrees C) was high enough for the germination of I. lacustris in Cerne jezero lake was 119 days and occurred during the period June to September in 2004-2011.

Temperature and current velocity distributions were measured. The movement of the thermal bar and the horizontal heat transport were examined. The temperature off-shore the thermal bar was found to be constant within a vertical. The velocity distributions were complex and dependent on wind conditions. Calculations of changes in heat content showed that there was a horizontal heat transport from the near-shore warm zone towards the thermal bar. The observed off-shore progression of the thermal bar was compared with analytically computed progression rates. The progression rate is underestimated if it is assumed that surface heating and vertical mixing are the only mechanisms contributing to the thermal bar progression. Better agreement is obtained if mixing of warm and cold water near the thermal bar zone is considered.

J	Cottingham, KL; Carpenter, SR				Cottingham, KL; Carpenter, SR			Population, community, and ecosystem variates as ecological indicators: Phytoplankton responses to whole-lake enrichment	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We quantified the reliability of phytoplankton population, community, and ecosystem variates as indicators of whole-lake enrichment. Variates with high sensitivity to perturbation and low background variability were assumed to be more reliable indicators than variates with low sensitivity or high variability. Our data set included weekly data in four lakes (three manipulated and one reference) during two pretreatment summers and two summers of enrichment. We determined background variability by evaluating change in each variate from year to year in the reference lake throughout the experiment and in each manipulated lake during the pretreatment period. We evaluated sensitivity to enrichment using the frequency of departure from expected conditions for each variate during the period of experimental enrichment. Using this information, we then (1) tested the expectation that species populations are more reliable indicators of perturbation than ecosystem variates (biomass, chlorophyll, and primary productivity), and (2) evaluated whether community variates (genera, taxonomic divisions, allometric variates, and community diversity) were reliable indicators of enrichment. Contrary to expectations from other perturbations, phytoplankton species populations were less reliable indicators of enrichment than community and ecosystem variates. Chlorophyll, species diversity, and species evenness were the most reliable indicators of enrichment: each changed significantly only during the first year of enrichment and only in the three enriched lakes. Simultaneous changes in multiple taxonomic divisions also signaled enrichment very reliably. In contrast, the frequency of significant changes in species populations differed little between the reference lake and the enriched lakes, even after experimental enrichment. Changes in species were difficult to detect reliably due to high background variability in all four lakes: most taxa were not present often enough during a single year to assess reliably whether they had increased or decreased compared to the previous years. Genera and allometric variates were also unreliable indicators due to high variability and moderate sensitivity, respectively. Reliable indicators of phytoplankton responses to enrichment were very different from reliable indicators of animal responses to toxic stressors, suggesting that it may be difficult to make generalizations regarding the use of population, community, and ecosystem variates as indicators of a wide array of perturbations.

Mirex was detected (range = non-detectable to 25 .mu.g/kg) only in resident fish in the tributary accessible to migrating salmon. By estimating the number of salmon that spawned in the fall of 1983, the amount of mirex transported into Lake Ontario tributaries ranged from 53 g/yr to 121 g/yr, assuming a 4.4% to 10% survival rate to migration of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). With an angler harvest of 50% of the spawning run, potentially 26 to 60.5 g/yr of mirex is available for return to the lake ecosystem. Similarly, a harvest rate of 50% represents a 26 to 60.5 g/yr removal of mirex from Lake Ontario by sport fishermen.																			0380-1330						1988	14	4					388	393		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71571-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71571-3													WOS:A1988R673900003

Alum Application to Improve Water Quality in a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Nutrient removal in treatment wetlands declines during winter months due to temperature. A 3-mo (wintertime) mesocosm study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of alum in immobilizing P as well as other nutrients during this period of reduced treatment efficiency. Eighteen mesocosms, triplicate alum, and three controls or no alum were established with either Typha spp., Scboenoplectus californicus, or SAV (Najas guadalupensis-dominated). Alum was delivered by timer at a rate of 0.81 g Al m(-2) d(-1) and parameters measured included: pH, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and soluble aluminum (Al). Alum-treated mesocosms had significantly lower pH values (8.1) than controls (8.8), but well within the elevated pH range for aluminum toxicity Alum significantly reduced all measured water column nutrients with the exception of ammonium N, which remained unaffected, and particulate R which increased. This study demonstrated that seasonal low-dosage alum application to different vegetation communities in a treatment wetland can significantly improve treatment efficiencies for SRP (87 vs. 58%) and TP (62 vs. 44%) but also increase DOC (19 vs. 0%) and TKN (12 vs. -3%) removal capacity to a lesser degree. Mum applications within close proximity of the treatment wetland effluent points should be implemented with caution due to the production of alum floc-bound P which could potentially affect discharge permit compliance for total suspended solids or total P.

It is an Essential Climate Variable and associated with climate tipping points. Multi-annual time series of permafrost ground temperatures can be, however, derived through modelling of the heat transfer between atmosphere and ground using landsurface temperature, snow- and landcover observations from space. Results show that the northern hemisphere permafrost ground temperatures have increased on average by about one degree Celsius since 2000. This is in line with trends of permafrost proxies observable from space: surface water extent has been decreasing across the Arctic; the landsurface is subsiding continuously in some regions indicating ground ice melt; hot summers triggered increased subsidence as well as thaw slumps; rock glaciers are accelerating in some mountain regions. The applicability of satellite data for permafrost proxy monitoring has been demonstrated mostly on a local to regional scale only. There is still a lack of consistency of acquisitions and of very high spatial resolution observations. Both are needed for implementation of circumpolar monitoring of lowland permafrost. In order to quantify the impacts of permafrost thaw on the carbon cycle, advancement in wetland and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration monitoring from space is needed.

J	Caldwell, TJ; Wilhelm, FM; Dux, A				Caldwell, Timothy J.; Wilhelm, Frank M.; Dux, Andy			Non-native pelagic macroinvertebrate alters population dynamics of herbivorous zooplankton in a large deep lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Establishment of non-native species can alter native species populations and restructure lake food webs through complex tropic interactions such as intraguild predation or classic trophic cascades. Although the freshwater shrimp Mysis diluviana is well known for its ability to impact both primary and secondary productivity through omnivorous feeding in aquatic ecosystems in which it has been introduced, empirical evidence of mysid consumption of zooplankton prey and associated impacts on cladoceran communities from the same lake is uncommon. Furthermore, recent literature has suggested that mysids may impact other zooplankton populations outside of cladocerans. To test the hypothesis that introduced mysids negatively affect the seasonal abundance of cladocerans in Lake Pend Oreille, a large and deep (348 km(2), max. depth: 352 m) lake in Idaho, USA, we quantified the seasonal diet and consumption rates of mysids and compared them with cladoceran production rates. During isothermal conditions, mysids opportunistically fed on copepods, diatoms, and rotifers. However, during stratification, mysids strongly selected cladocerans. In addition, during isothermal conditions, mysids consumed 100% of cladoceran production and selected reproductive-sized individuals. We interpret this to show that mysids regulate the production of cladocerans when the lake is not stratified. The suppression of cladocerans in the spring coincides with the appearance of kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) fry whose growth and survival may be negatively affected by the lack of abundant cladocerans, a preferred prey. This suggests a possible cascading effect to higher trophic levels.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2016	73	5					832	843		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0144													WOS:000375425900011

Current models for estimating river ice thickness are mostly based on environmental data. They require several inputs and yield only a global estimate of ice thickness for a large heterogeneous area. Attempts have been made intending to retrieve river ice thickness from remote sensing using monopolarized C-band radar data. No reliable maps of ice thickness have been produced. In this paper, the potential of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for estimating river ice thickness is demonstrated, and a river ice thickness retrieval model is proposed. The C-band SAR images used in this paper were acquired by Radarsat-2 in the winter of 2009 over the Saint-Francois River (Southern Quebec), the Koksoak River (Northern Quebec), and the Mackenzie River (Northwest Territories) in Canada. Field campaigns were carried out to obtain ice thickness validation data at 70 locations. Polarimetric entropy was used to obtain ice thickness estimates. This approach results in spatially distributed ice thickness maps for selected ice types.

Transportat Res Board				Most individuals living in cold climates realize that on snowy days their commute will take longer. Although traffic volumes are often lower. the combination of reduced speeds and capacity causes severe congestion, particularly on signalized urban networks. Signal coordination that reduces traffic congestion in typical clear conditions results in an uncoordinated and suboptimal timing plan. Traffic parameters for developing signal timings during inclement weather conditions are examined. With the completion of the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) advanced transportation management system there is an opportunity to change signal timing plans by communicating with each controller from the Transportation Operations Center. This operation makes feasible a library of special signal timing plans, with one allocated for inclement weather. Traffic flow data were collected over a range of seven inclement weather severity conditions at two intersections for the 1999-2000 winter season. The data indicate that the largest decrease in vehicle performance occurs when snow and slush begin to accumulate on the road surface. Saturation flows decrease by 20 percents speeds decrease by 30 percent, and start-up lost times increase by 23 percent. UDOT is now developing and implementing modified inclement weather coordinated signal timing plans for the major signalized corridors in the Salt Lake Valley. The determination of when to implement an inclement weather signal timing plan is based on four general criteria: storm severity, projected duration, area of influence, and immediately projected running speeds. With these considerations, traffic engineers can determine whether to implement an inclement weather signal timing plan.

An Assessment of Development of a Transboundary Small Lake: Calibato Lake, San Pablo City and Rizal, Laguna, The Philippines	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												Commencing on the scarcity of development studies on lakes (as the field is dominated by limnology and aquaculture studies) and small-lake studies (as the field is heavily concentrated on big-lake studies), this study assesses the underdevelopment of Calibato Lake, a small transboundary lake. The article reveals the lack of development initiatives in the lake as well as definitive time table from its administrative agencies on when they will be carried out. It argues that the LLDA, the City Government of San Pablo and the Local Government of Rizal must now take action to instigate and bring development in the lake. Particularly, by initiating the crafting of a zoning-development plan which is crucial for managing the water resource, regulating aquaculture, and facilitating subsequent actions; by promoting ecotourism which is essential in extending work opportunities and community development; and by protecting the many natural springs and their watershed which is critical in the preservation of the lake and its environment.

In the littoral zones of these three lakes, the mean N2O fluxes were 3.1 +/- 6.7 mu gN(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1), 2.5 +/- 2.8 mu gN(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 7.2 +/- 6.9 mu gN(2)O-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The fluxes showed a large temporal and spatial variation in lake littoral zones. On the whole, lake littoral zones were the emission sources for atmospheric N2O although negative fluxes occurred on most of the observation sites. The mean flux significantly correlated with NO3--N concentration in the sediments at each site, suggesting that spatial variations of N2O fluxes have a connection with NO3--N concentration. The seasonal pattern of the flux was positively related to daily radiation and air temperature and negatively to water depth, indicating that these factors and alga activity had an important effect on N2O emissions. The summertime N2O budget across air-water interface was estimated to be 6.7 mg N2O-N m(-2), 5.4 mg N2O-N m(-2) and 15.6 mg N2O-N m(-2) from the littoral zones of Lake Mochou, Lake Tuanjie and Lake Darning, respectively. Our results indicated that lake littoral N2O emissions could have a regional importance in coastal Antarctica. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we characterize the temporal and spatial extents of this extreme drought at the monthly and seasonal scales and perform a first assessment on the associated impact in the hydro-meteorological fields, as well as the consequent influence on vegetation dynamics and cereal productions. This episode corresponds to the driest two-year case for the FC area since 1940, although just slightly drier than the 1998-2000 drought. Precipitation decline was mostly noticeable over Iraq (up to 70%), with the suppression of rainfall particularly acute during the first hydrological year (2007-2008). From the meteorological perspective, winter and transition months were dominated by high pressures that inhibited synoptic activity entering from the eastern Mediterranean and favoured relative north-easterly winds and drier air masses with low convective instability. The impact of the 2007-2009 drought in vegetation was evaluated with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from VEGETATION instrument. It is shown that large sectors of south-eastern Turkey, eastern Syria, northern Iraq and western Iran present up to six months of persistently stressed vegetation (negative NDVI anomalies) between January and June 2008. During the following dry year (2008-2009) dry areas are restricted to northern Iraq with up to five months of stressed vegetation. Finally we looked at the impacts on cereal production (wheat and barley) in the region and it is shown that the major grain-growing countries in the area (Syria. Iraq and Iran) were significantly affected by this drought, particularly in the year 2008. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The arid and semi-arid regions of Asia are the second largest dust source on Earth, and their release, transport and deposition of dust affect global climate change, as well as marine and terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. Over the past similar to 2000 years, human activity has outpaced natural climatic variability as the dominant control of dust storms in northern China. Thus, exploring the potential of anthropogenic Asian dust as a marker of the Anthropocene and its impacts on lake ecosystems may contribute to an improved definition of the characteristics and timing of the Anthropocene. In this context, we measured spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a from the sediments of an undisturbed alpine lake in northern China, and compared the results with dust storm data from the same cores and with regional climatic records. Asian dust is a widely distributed, globally significant signal of human activity, and it is also well preserved in various geological archives; hence, we propose anthropogenic dust can be considered as a potential marker of the Anthropocene. Anthropogenic dust signals in stratigraphic records during the past similar to 2000 years differ substantially from those during the early and middle Holocene, which demonstrates that, at least since similar to 2000 years ago, human activity has exceeded the natural forcing of dust transport in northern China. We therefore propose that there are spatial and temporal differences in the onset of the Anthropocene, as defined by anthropogenic dust deposition, which is therefore time-transgressive. Our spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a record is consistent with dust storm activity over the past similar to 2000 years (except since the 1950s), suggesting that anthropogenic dust storms were the dominant control on lake primary production. Prior to the 1950s the interactions of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), human activity, dust storms and lake ecosystems resulted in a shift from a pattern in which "human activity outpaced the EASM as the dominant control on the Earth surface system" to one in which, after the 1950s, "human activity became the dominant factor influencing the EASM and the Earth surface system". In the future this pattern may trend towards one in which there is the "sustainable development of humans and the environment". We suggest that, in order to better understand the interactions of human activity, climate and environment, future research on the Anthropocene should focus on its time-transgressive characteristics and regional differences, in addition to the "Great Acceleration".

An alternative is using models, which summarise the knowledge of the functioning of the system so that they can be used to answer specific questions. We present a model to calculate the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature of inland water bodies based on air temperature and on their geographical and morphological characteristics. The seven model parameters were parameterized by using official monitoring data and the satellite temperature data of the data set LakeSST for French water bodies. The performance of the parameterised model was compared to that of two widely used models (FLake and air2water with four parameters). The model showed a good performance in the simulation of epilimnion temperatures, especially in the summer. For hypolimnion temperatures the performance was worse, but still comparable to that of other models. Because of its good performance and the few data needed to run the model, it is a good choice for managers interested in the thermal behaviour of inland water bodies.

The measurements performed since the 1970s at the time of the maximum overturn documented an increase of water temperature around 0.0 12-0.028 degrees C yr(-1), closely resembling the warming rate found in other lakes in Europe and North America.. The DSL showed an increase of total phosphorus after the 1960s and a complete recovery after the 1990s of Lake Maggiore, which reached mean values of TP close to those of the pristine conditions (<10 mu g P l(-1)). Present TP concentrations in the other lakes are above 100 mu g P l(-1) (Lugano), 30-40 mu g P l(-1) (Como), 50-60 mu g P l(-1) (Iseo) and c. 20 mu g P l(-1) (Garda), with only Lake Garda showing a clear tendency to increasing P-concentrations in recent years. The higher trophic status of lakes Lugano and Iseo has favoured hypolinmetic anoxia due to meromixis since the 1960s and the 1990s, respectively, from which there was a partial recovery in 2005. Monthly samplings carried out in the last decades showed a strong coupling between long-term variation in algal nutrients and phytoplankton. On a shorter temporal scale, a significant relationship between the extent of water mixing during the spring months and the replenishment of nutrients and algal biomass in the growing season has also been verified in lakes Iseo, Garda and Lugano.

Hyalella azteca was the most important scoter food and made up 97% (aggregate percent dry weight) of the diet for 13 breeding females, 84% for 11 breeding males, and 100% for 10 ducklings. Hyalella azteca was consistently the most abundant food organism present in Eckman dredge samples taken at scoter feeding sites. Adults consumed H. azteca that were significantly larger than those consumed by ducklings. Both adults and ducklings fed primarily by diving at sites 1-3 m deep, but adults fed at deeper sites than ducklings. Timing of reproduction in white-winged scoters seems to be closely timed with increases in the biomass of abundance of Hyalella and possibly possibly other invertebrate foods.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	1986	64	8					1652	1654		10.1139/z86-248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z86-248													WOS:A1986E207300008

Yet due to its large breeding range in the remote steppes and deserts of Central Asia and to its cryptic behaviour, it has been difficult to obtain enough comparable data to make reliable estimates of population trends. Here, we present the results of 10 years of extensive biannual surveys throughout southern Kazakhstan, considered to host the majority of the breeding birds in Asia, and we discuss trends in the Kazakh populations for the first decade of this century. The breeding Houbara population has generally declined over the greater part of Kazakhstan between 2000 and 2009 but with important regional differences. A steep decline was observed in north-east Caspian and Karakum, and a sharp drop followed by a stabilisation occurred in Kyzylkum. Over the same period, estimated densities were stable or increased in the area surrounding Lake Balkash, and increased in the Betpak-Dala region of central Kazakhstan. Autumn surveys showed more variability and revealed little decline overall. It was also clear that Betpak-Dala and Balkash regions hosted the largest populations. Our findings suggest that it is a complex undertaking to assign a level of vulnerability for this species as a whole. Highly variable population trends between regions indicate that threats and pressures are to a considerable extent region-specific, and that conservation measures need to be adjusted locally.					; Judas, Jacky/AAA-7557-2021	combreau, Olivier/0009-0003-1705-2827; 													0959-2709	1474-0001				JUN	2011	21	2					134	141		10.1017/S0959270910000377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270910000377													WOS:000291054500002

Range Extension of the Non-native Northern Crayfish Faxonius virilis (Hagen, 1870) (Decapoda: Cambaridae) to British Columbia, Canada	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Here I report the expansion of the northern crayfish Faxonius virilis (Hagen, 1870) (Decapoda: Cambaridae), a non-native species, into the Kootenay River Basin in southeastern British Columbia. Observation of this crayfish occurred in late summer 2023 at Moyie Lake, British Columbia based on active search collections from the littoral areas of the north end of the lake. I recorded 12 F. virilis individuals in 15 minutes of search, and the abundance and the occurrence of juvenile and adult females and males suggests that they are well established in the lake. As this region has been identified as having high invasion potential and risk for impact, further research on this species' range in the area and its effects on the local ecosystem will be useful to guide management actions.

For the genetically distinct diatom Pseudo-nitzschia pungens var. pungens, we used six microsatellite markers to investigate the spatial and temporal genetic composition in the heterogeneous Southern Bight of the North Sea. Although our sampling area (ca. 100 km) comprised water bodies with different environmental conditions (marine, estuary, saline lake) and different degrees of connectivity (from complete isolation to supposedly free exchange between environments), no evidence of genetic differentiation was found. Expanding our sampling area (ca. 650 km), suggested a homogenous population structure over even larger areas in the North Sea. Our results suggest that the population structure of this diatom is mainly shaped by strong homogenizing effects of gene flow preventing genetic drift, even in water bodies with limited connectivity.

Heavy metal concentrations in the selected tissues of the Persian sturgeon, Acipenser persicus, from southern coast of the Caspian Sea	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Bioaccumulation of heavy metals, including Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in muscle, gill, liver, kidney and stomach in Acipencer persicus was studied. Fish were collected from the 'Iranian fishery zone 1' located between Astara and Kiyahshahr across five stations in the study area during the autumn catch season in 2001. Samples were analyzed by wet digestion with hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid. Analyses were testified using spike method. A sample of bovine liver (CRM 185R) was also tested to ascertain reliability of analyses. Digested samples were analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The bioaccumulation pattern for Zn in different tissues studied was stomach > liver > kidney > gllls > muscle tissue. The mean concentration of Zn in the stomach was 136.6 +/- 10.70 mu g g(-1) dry weight. Cu with the maximum concentration of 39.71 +/- 8.85 mu g g(-1) dry weight in liver showed a bioaccumulation pattern of liver > kidney > stomach > gills > muscle tissue. The bioaccumulation pattern for Pb was determined as gills > liver > kidney > stomach > muscle tissue. Maximum mean concentrations of Pb 6.87 +/- 2.25 mu g g(-1) dry weight belonged to gills. Bioaccumulation pattern for Cd in the different organs studied in A. persicus was kidney > liver > gills > stomach > muscle tissue. Maximum mean concentration of 5.1 +/- 0.97 mu g g(-1) dry weight belonged to kidneys and the minimum mean concentration of 0.05 +/- 0.007 mu g g(-1) dry weight belonged to muscle tissue. Concentration of the metals in the muscles samples were below the most guidelines for human consumption. However, the concentrations for heavy metals were higher than duidelines in some other organs this does not pose health problems as these organs are not used for human consumption.																			1562-2916					JUL	2009	8	2					175	184																WOS:000269941400007
J	Ringelberg, J; van Gool, E; Brehm, M				Ringelberg, J; van Gool, E; Brehm, M			Density and depth variations of Daphnia multilocus genotypes during a summer period in Lake Maarsseveen	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The genotype composition of a Daphnia population complex during a summer period in Lake Maarsseveen (The Netherlands) was determined by allozyme analysis. The depth distribution, diel vertical migration and several parameters of the total population were measured. Young-of-the-year (0(+)) perch (Perca fluviatilis) were caught and species and allozyme types of Daphnia in the perch gut were also analysed. During May 1997, the densities of D. hyalina, D. galeata, the back-cross D. g x h - hyalina and the multilocus allozyme genotypes of the hybrid D. g x It decreased, except one multilocus genotype (MMMF). Total population size decreased and the ratio of females with eggs to those without eggs decreased as well. Food limitation during this clear-water phase in the lake is considered responsible. All genotypes, except MMMF, gradually descended in the water column. This drift is thought to be a reaction to the abundantly present 0(+) perch or to the kairomones of this fish, although predation on the daphnids was still absent. In June, diel vertical migration started, except again part of the MMMF subpopulation. The other part migrated over a short distance compared with the other taxa and allozyme types. Within two weeks, the upper 5 m of the epilimnion was devoid of Daphnia, and guts of perch were predominantly filled with MMMF The daphnids in the gut and the lake did not differ in allozyme type composition. By the end of July, population density had increased again. The size and composition of the Daphnia population complex continuously changed during the study period, as did the depth distribution of the components. Different genotypes within the population complex seem to have developed different strategies to cope with starvation and predation and the state at a particular moment can be understood only if past and present factors are considered.

CB concentrations in the Grand and Niagara Rivers, in 4 sewage-treatment plant effluents and in 3 drinking water samples were determined. CB concentrations in the water samples were low, < 1 ng/l except in effluents and near point sources. The CB concentrations in sediments were low in Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie, but higher in Lake Ontario. Major sources of CB to Lake Ontario were chemical waste dump leachates and direct chemical manufacturing effluents located mainly around Niagara Falls, New York [USA]. Data from sediment cores indicated that CB contamination of Lake Ontario began .apprx. 40 yr ago. A limited number of fish were analyzed.

Gradual demise of a thin southern Laurentide ice sheet recorded by Mississippi drainage	NATURE												At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), about 21,000 years before present, land-based ice sheets held enough water to reduce global mean sea level by 130 metres(1). Yet after decades of study, major uncertainties remain as to the distribution of that ice(2). Here we test four reconstructions of North American deglacial ice-sheet history(3-6) by quantitatively connecting them to high-resolution oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records from the Gulf of Mexico(7-11) using a water mixing model(12). For each reconstruction, we route meltwater(3-6) and seasonal runoff(13-16) through the time-evolving Mississippi drainage basin, which co-evolves with ice geometry(3-6) and changing topography as ice loads deform the solid Earth and produce spatially variable sea level in a process known as glacial isostatic adjustment(17). The delta O-18 records show that the Mississippi-drained southern Laurentide ice sheet contributed only 5.4 +/- 2.1 metres to global sea level rise, of which 0.66 +/- 0.07 metres were released during the meltwater pulse 1A event 14,650-14,310 years before present(18), far less water than previously thought(5,12,19). In contrast, the three reconstructions based on glacial isostatic adjustment(3-5) overpredict the delta O-18-based post-LGM meltwater volume by a factor of 1.6 to 3.6. The fourth reconstruction(6), which is based on ice physics, has a low enough Mississippi-routed meltwater discharge to be consistent with delta O-18 constraints, but also contains the largest LGM North American ice volume. This suggests that modelling based on ice physics may be the best way of matching isotopic records while also sequestering enough water in the North American ice sheets to match the observed LGM sea level fall(1).

For this purpose, high-resolution multi-proxy records were used to obtain information on lake level variations and how these are related to direct precipitation proxies. Allochthonous minerogenic input as reflected by potassium (K), is directly linked to precipitation driven by variations in Indian Summer Monsoon. Negatively correlated elements such as Ca, Sr and Mg and associated carbonate mineral phases represent autochthonous sediment production, which is coupled to evaporation in these closed systems. delta C-13 and delta O-18 of bulk carbonates represent lake water conditions, i.e., salinity and lake water volume, interpreted as precipitation-evaporation (P/E) balance. In combination with geomorphological features, i.e., lake level terraces and paleo-shorelines, the multy-proxy data set from Nam Co is used to reconstruct lake level dynamics. Low lake levels of >90 m below the recent one between 20 and 16 ka cal BP are associated with most enriched delta 18Ocarb values and the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite in a shallow lake with highly dynamic allochthonous minerogenic input. Similar conditions are observed between 13.1 and 11.4 ka cal BP matching the Younger Dryas chronozone. Between 15.5 and 13.1 ka cal BP as well as during the Early Holocene (11.4 to 8.0 ka cal BP) distinctly depleted delta O-18(carb) and delta C-13(carb) coupled with high rates of allochthonous minerogenic input suggest substantial strengthening in precipitation. After 9.4 ka cal BP, the terrigenous input and thus precipitation is significantly reduced, whereas delta O-18(carb) reveals only a slight enrichment trend and thus a slowly but steady decrease in lake level througout the Mid-to Late Holocene. The decoupling of this relation between precipitation and lake level suggest that lake level terraces of large endorheic lakes on the TP and also delta O-18(carb) records are not a direct indicator of (monsoonal) precipitiation, whereas the allochtonous minerogenic input can be directly linked to precipitation dynamics. This is supported by the comparison to regional archives from the Arabian Sea and the northern Bay of Bengal, showing the very same pattern in precipitation variability. The presented monsoon precipitation record from Nam Co additionally reveals a link to supra-regional atmospheric circulation components as it is oscillating in-and anti-phase to ElNino strength and frequency. A distinct precipitation change at 2 ka cal BP seems to have affected all archives, however leaving space for future studies to find the cause of this Late-Holocene climatic shift.

Due to their role in increasing soil fertility, nebkhas (coppice dunes) are regarded as important components of arid land ecosystems. Yet, despite their frequent occurrence, little information exists regarding their dust fall effect and influence range. We investigated the grain size distribution around N. tangutorum at a small scale (within 10 m) according to four wind directions and analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of particles. The amount of non-erodible particles (>0.85 mm) increased with distance from the shrub. The amount of erodible (<0.45 mm) and semi-erodible particles (0.45-0.85 mm) showed an opposite trend, indicating that the shrubs have a protective effect. The dominant particles around the shrubs were non-erodible due to long term accelerated wind erosion and subsequent removal of fine particles.																			1195-6860	2376-7626				OCT 2	2019	26	4					347	358		10.1080/11956860.2019.1646064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2019.1646064													WOS:000487343000006

In February and March, Mn oxides reduction caused high concentrations of DGT-labile Zn (14 similar to 235 mu g L-1), as evidenced by the significant correlation between DGT-labile Zn and DGT-labile Mn in sediments. In June and July, algal blooms reduced concentrations of dissolved Zn via algal assimilation. From August through October, concentrations of dissolved Zn in overlying water (338 similar to 1023 mu g L-1) exceeded the water quality limit for fisheries in China (100 mu g L-1). This was attributed to reductive dissolution of Mn oxides in sediments caused by algal degradation followed by complexation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which was identified in a simulated algal bloom experiment. In the winter, decreased Zn mobility was mainly attributed to adsorption by Mn oxides. It was concluded that enhanced Zn pollution risk from sediments is worthy of concern especially during algal degradation in eutrophic lakes.

Titan's liquids: Exotic behavior and its implications on global fluid circulation	ICARUS												Based on a validated model for cryogenic chemical systems, referred to as CRYOCHEM ("Cryogenic Chemistry Model"), surface liquids on Titan are shown to exhibit exotic behavior of density increase with temperature but decrease with pressure, unless the temperature falls below 89.8 K. It is also the case for the atmospheric liquid condensates below an altitude where the liquid density is minimum. The exotic behavior is of compositional origin, which does not have an analog in the atmosphere and liquid water on Earth. As the latitudinal and seasonal variations of surface temperature are known, it is possible to map out the global liquid and vapor density variations as well as the equilibrium phase compositions, which will be useful as inputs for atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) and investigations of Titan's methane-equivalent of Earth's hydrological cycle, local subsurface alkanology (equivalent to hydrology on Earth), lake convection, and clastic and chemical sedimentation in the lakes. Further, the density variations can be used to derive a general idea about global fluid circulation in the upper crust based on averaged conditions on Titan. The surface liquid should tend to flow toward the hottest spot on Titan and a return flow occurs beneath the surface, thus providing analogies with thermohaline circulation in Earth's oceans. The vapor phase, on the other hand, has ordinary properties that make the global atmospheric circulation similar to the Hadley cell on Earth, but Titan's cycle reaches the polar regions. The calculated compositions of surface liquids are more methane-rich than other models indicated, thus qualitatively in the right direction to satisfy polar-lake compositions deduced from loss tangents. However, quantitatively there remains a need to find yet more accurate liquid compositions and an optimum equilibrium within constraints of the atmospheric measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A field-scale sequential hybrid constructed wetland (SHCW) system comprising of ecological floating beds with biofilms, zeolite filter beds, facultative pond, and an ecological pond with submerged plants was built for the improvement of the effluent quality. SHCW exhibited significant removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total phosphorus (TP) with average monthly removal efficiency of 72.52% +/- 3.89%, 91.58% +/- 3.12%, and 76.29% +/- 8.15%, respectively, during the survey period. After treatment, the final concentration of COD, NH4+-N, total nitrogen (TN), and TP in the effluent was 13.75 +/- 0.51, 0.39 +/- 0.03, 11.89 +/- 0.51, and 0.09 +/- 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, the treatment units showed seasonal variations in COD, NH4+-N, TN, and TP removal efficiency, and summer was the best season for pollutant removal. The treatment cost of SHCW was estimated to be 0.29 RMB/m(3) ($0.044/m(3)), which makes it a cost-effective, feasible, and favorable environmental treatment method for the improvement of treated wastewater. Therefore, WWTPs are recommended to be accompanied with SHCW to achieve acceptable effluent quality and provide a better environment.					; Hamidian, Amir Hossein/L-6250-2019; Zhu, Liying/AAN-1917-2021; Hamidian, Amir/L-6250-2019	Zhu, Liying/0000-0001-9194-6990; Hamidian, Amir Hossein/0000-0002-1813-0669; 													1092-8758	1557-9018				FEB 1	2022	39	2					168	177		10.1089/ees.2021.0041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2021.0041		OCT 2021											WOS:000706461200001

Monobothrium ulmeri, Biacetabulum meridianum and an undescribed species of Penarchigetes were recovered from the stomach, pyloric bend, and the 1st loop of the small intestine of the suckers. Infections of M. ulmeri were limited to an 8-mo. period, and were seasonally periodic in prevalence, mean intensity, maturation and length distribution. A temperature dependent rejection response is discussed as a possible factor involved in the periodicity of this species. The maturation of M. ulmeri corresponded closely to the host''s reproductive cycle, and may have been affected by changes in the host''s hormonal levels during the spring. Infections of B. meridianum were present throughout the year, and exhibited a seasonal periodicity in prevalence, maturation and length distribution. The mean intensity of infection suggests that the establishment of this species is inhibited by heavy burdens of M. ulmeri. Penarchigetes sp. was nonseasonal in prevalence, mean intensity and maturation. The continuous availability of infective procercoids and the lack of a sucker rejection response are discussed as possible explanations for this distribution. Unlike B. meridianum and Penarchigetes sp., the mean intensity of M. ulmeri showed a close relationship with host sex.																			0022-3395	1937-2345					1976	62	3					434	441		10.2307/3279154	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3279154													WOS:A1976BY08700013

Sedimentation rate varied from 26 to 700 g DW m(-2) d(-1) (DW = dry weight), with a mean value of 170 g DW m(-2) d(-1). Under the influence of prevailing westerly and south-westerly winds, the sedimentation rate was higher in the northern part, and lower in the western and southern parts of the lake. An increasing trend towards autumn could be followed in both years. The mean sedimentation rates in the dry year 1996 with a low lake water level exceeded those of the "normal" 1995 by a factor of more than two. New sedimentation formed 10-15% of the downward sediment flux in 1995 and 4-6% in 1996, while the major part of entrapped matter originated from resuspended bottom sediments. The dynamics of gross sedimentation showed no relation to the primary production but correlated significantly with the concentration of suspended solids, with the average wind speed and with the mean depth of the lake during trap exposition. The composition of entrapped matter did not show seasonal variation but differed between the sampling stations. The amount of particulate organic matter (POM) per DW varied from 11% at places where the bottom sediment consisted of moraine or sand to 28% at places with muddy bottom. N:POM was rather stable (45-61 mg g(-1), C-var = 6%). The variability of P:POM (3.5-7.1, C-var = 20%) exceeded that of P:DW (0.75-1.31 mg g(-1), C-var = 10%) showing the essential role of mineral-bound P in the settling material. In these conditions, the N:P ratio was determined by the POM content of settling matter. POM:DW in settling material was generally higher than in the 0-2 cm layer of bottom sediments.

The data were collected on a monthly or bimonthly basis. Seasonal variance of organic matter content does not exceed 30% of its total variance, while the DOC and the SAS trends are significantly negative and positive, respectively, over the whole transect. The organic matter content, however, exhibits pronounced interannual and decadal changes, with periods of high and low carbon content and evident changes in composition of the SAS content. The changes indicate altering episodes between eutrophication and oligotrophication, embedded in the overall oligotrophication trend in the considered period. Both series were correlated with the potential local and regional yearly-averaged drivers in both atmosphere and sea. DOC is most strongly (significant at 99%) correlated with the Po River discharges, at the phase lag of -1 to -2 years. For the SAS, the largest correlations (significant at 99%) are obtained with the Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System index (BiOS index), at the phase lag of -3 to -4 years. Correlations between the organic matter content and the hemispheric or the regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, East Atlantic/West Russia, East Atlantic, Scandinavian, and Mediterranean Oscillation) are much lower and only sparsely significant at 95% at some phase lags. The same was found for the other local drivers (precipitation and net heat flux). Our analysis highlights the importance of remote processes, like the BiOS, that weren't previously considered to shape the biogeochemical properties of such shallow coastal region impacted by freshwater load. To properly assess such impacts, long-termecologicalmonitoring and homogenized data series are required. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In May 1991, variations in constituent concentrations were associated with shallow regions (chlorophyll), upwelling regions (nitrate), and river inflow (silicate and total P). However, only the spatial pattern of elevated silicate concentration near the mouth of the Truckee River was consistent throughout the year. Late-spring chlorophyll enrichment in shallow regions like the south basin appeared to be part of seasonal variations between the deep, central region of the lake and shallows possibly associated with light availability. During the study period, processes associated with strong winds appeared to be an important source of spatial heterogeneity. Profiles and spatial distributions of temperature and nitrate concentration during May 1991 indicated upwelling along the northwest and southwest margins of the lake. Examination of wind data for the region revealed that winds favorable for upwelling were common at Pyramid Lake, and temperature profiles along the north-south axis of the lake indicated additional upwelling events in June and September 1990. Strong winds also transport a large quantity of dust over the lake surface, which may be a major source of particle-bound P.																			0706-652X					MAY	1993	50	5					1045	1054		10.1139/f93-121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-121													WOS:A1993LR75800020

TRIN EX STEUDEL AND Typha angustifolia (L.) GROWING IN NATURAL WATER ECOSYSTEMS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Zinc and copper play an important role in plant physiology. Nevertheless, when present in the environment at high concentrations they exhibit synergistic effects of toxicity to plants. Zinc and copper concentrations in sediments and water, as well as their accumulation in littoral plant species, were examined in this study. Five natural water ecosystems were chosen in the Poznan city area with Phragmites australis and Typha angustifolia developed zones. Plants were divided into aerial and underground organs, i.e. leaves, stems and rhizomes (P. australis), and leaves and rhizomes (T. angustifolia). The measurements were conducted at the beginning and at the end of the summer season. Our investigation revealed the possibility of Zn and Cu removal from natural water ecosystems by two littoral plant species, even at low concentrations in sediments and water. There were differences in Zn and Cu sediment and water load in the city water reservoirs studied. Higher Zn concentration in the environment restricted the Cu uptake by plants. Transportation of Zn in P. australis to above-ground plant parts makes possible the use of this plant in phytoremediation, while in T angustifolia Zn was mostly immobilized in rhizomes. Cu was mainly accumulated in rhizomes in both littoral plant species, which suggested relatively low Cu concentrations in the environment and reduced translocation to above-ground plant organs.					; Borowiak, Klaudia/O-1333-2015; Mleczek, Mirosław/MCI-7217-2025	Mleczek, Miroslaw/0000-0002-0064-6472; Golinski, Piotr/0000-0001-8129-1185; Borowiak, Klaudia/0000-0001-9879-3683; Drzewiecka, Kinga/0000-0002-8658-2691													1018-4619	1610-2304					2011	20	2					325	333																WOS:000289040000006

In this study, the sediment samples were collected from the Dahekou Reservoir in the Xilingol League, and the orthogonal simulation experiments were conducted in the laboratory. The mathematical model, which was established using multiple linear regression methods, revealed the following. The order of the significance of the influences of the environmental factors on the nitrogen release from the sediments in the Dahekou Reservoir is water temperature (T) > dissolved oxygen (DO) > pH value > hydrodynamic force (K). The total nitrogen release flux from the sediments in the Dahekou Reservoir was 14.278 t/a in 2018, accounting for 27.91% of the total nitrogen (TN) pollution load input during the same period. In particular, in winter, the contribution rate of the nitrogen released from the sediments reached the highest level (57.06-63.26%), which was significantly higher than the river's contribution to the total nitrogen pollution load of the reservoir. The nitrogen released from the sediments became the main source of nitrogen nutrients in the reservoir in the ice-sealed period.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024															2296-665X				JUL 18	2022	10								907769	10.3389/fenvs.2022.907769	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.907769													WOS:000834474900001
J	Chen, J; Xie, P				Chen, Jun; Xie, Ping			Microcystin accumulation in freshwater bivalves from Lake Taihu, China, and the potential risk to human consumption	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The potential risk through ingestion of microcystins (MC) in contaminated mollusks has not been well studied. The present paper studied seasonal changes of MC content (determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) in various organs of three species of bivalves (Cristaria plicata, Hyriopsis cumingii, and Lamprotula leai) in Lake Taihu, China, where toxic cyanobacterial blooms occurred. Coinciding with peaks of seston MC (maximum, 5.7 mu g/L) and MC in cyanobacterial blooms (maximum, 0.534 mg/g), most organs showed sharp MC peaks during the summer, indicating both fast uptake and fast depuration by bivalves. Because hepatopancreas and intestine had considerably higher MC content than other organs, they are the most dangerous for human consumption. Both the present and previous studies show that the hepatopancreatic MC and total tissue MC often are correlated in various aquatic invertebrates. During the peak of the cyanobacterial blooms, C. plicata had higher hepatopancreatic MC content than the other bivalves, whereas H. cumingii had higher intestinal MC content than the other bivalves. Estimated daily intakes for humans from the consumption of whole tissues of the three bivalves were 0.48 to 0.94 mu g MC-LR equivalent/kg body weight (12- to 23.5-fold the tolerable daily intake value proposed by the World Health Organization), which indicates a high risk for humans consuming these bivalves.

These were: a temporary pond, Laguna del Zacatal (A = 7.64 ha, z(m) = 13.0 m); and two permanent lakes, Laguna Escondida (A = 18.26 ha, z(m) = 32.5 m) and Lago de Catemaco (A = 7254 ha, z(m) = 22.0 m). Both Fl Zacatal and La Escondida are warm monomictic, whereas Lago de Catemaco is polymictic. Our results support the hypothesis that most tropical lakes are prone to winter overturn. Dissolved oxygen showed large variation, from-almost constant epilimnetic saturation in all three lakes to hypolimetic anoxia in Laguna Escondida. Differences in mixing between lakes are determined by the joint influence of morphometry, rainfall and wind.																			0018-8158					DEC 20	1996	341	2					91	99		10.1007/BF00018113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018113													WOS:A1996WN58700001

Surveillance of the chemical and microbial quality of drinking water for safe water supply in an urban area	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												To ascertain the quality of drinking water, surveillance of drinking water quality was conducted in Bhopal. The water supply to water treatment plants (WTPs) is from Kolar dam and Upper Lake. There was no significant change in water quality at the Kolar WTP on a day-to-day basis except in summer, when the manganese content of raw water was 0.3-0.4 mg/L, which was removed during treatment. The treated water quality from Birla Mandir WTP was within desirable limits during all the seasons. Filtered water from Idgah WTP showed significant coliform counts, indicating malfunctioning of filter beds. However, after chlorination coliforms were absent. For Phulphukta WTP, residual chlorine at the sump was 0.8-2.0 mg/L; therefore finished water was free from bacterial contamination. The finished water quality of all the WTPs met Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation guidelines. Although the sump water was free from bacterial contamination, it was contaminated with coliforms at the consumer end, which may be attributed to improper maintenance of service reservoirs and contamination en route. The proper maintenance of the distribution network, awareness of hygienic and sanitary conditions around public taps and proper storage of water are prerequisites for maintaining a safe water supply in the city.																			0003-7214	1365-2087					2016	65	3					220	233		10.2166/aqua.2016.062	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2016.062													WOS:000375727000003

In general, these hermaphroditic animals displayed no signs of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic variation in all but one of the endemic species was of the same extent as that in geographically wide ranging invertebrates. On the other hand, the Lake Ohrid population of the common European species Dendrocoelum lacteum was monomorphic at all loci examined. D. sanctinaumi, one of the endemic species, exhibited a clear genetic subdivision into spring and littoral subpopulations. The genetic differentiation of Crenobia alpina alpina and C. a. montenigrina proved commensurable to that of well separated species from other genera. The data suggest that the separation of particular lineages in the set of Lake Ohrid endemics was widely dispersed over time.																			0015-5497						2003	51	1-2					105	109											14686654					WOS:000184416400013
J	Hajibabai, L; Ouyang, YF				Hajibabai, Leila; Ouyang, Yanfeng			Dynamic Snow Plow Fleet Management Under Uncertain Demand and Service Disruption	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS												It is sometimes challenging to plan winter maintenance operations in advance because snow storms are stochastic with respect to, e.g., start time, duration, impact area, and severity. In addition, maintenance trucks may not be readily available at all times due to stochastic service disruptions. A stochastic dynamic fleet management model is developed to assign available trucks to cover uncertain snow plowing demand. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the cost for truck deadheading and repositioning, as well as to maximize the benefits (i.e., level of service) of plowing. The problem is formulated into a dynamic programming model and solved using an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. Piecewise linear functional approximations are used to estimate the value function of system states (i.e., snow plow trucks location over time). We apply our model and solution approach to a snow plow operation scenario for Lake County, Illinois. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can solve the problem effectively and outperforms a rolling-horizon heuristic solution.

Microbes in High Arctic Snow and Implications for the Cold Biosphere	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												We applied molecular, microscopic, and culture techniques to characterize the microbial communities in snow and air at remote sites in the Canadian High Arctic (Ward Hunt Island, Ellesmere Island, and Cornwallis Island, latitudes 74 to 83 degrees N). Members of the Bacteria and Eukarya were prevalent in the snow, and their small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene signatures indicated strong local aerial transport within the region over the preceding 8 months of winter snowpack accumulation. Many of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were similar to previously reported SSU rRNA gene sequences from the Arctic Ocean, suggesting the importance of local aerial transport processes for marine microbiota. More than 47% of the cyanobacterial OTUs in the snow have been previously found in microbial mats in the region, indicating that this group was also substantially derived from local sources. Viable cyanobacteria isolated from the snow indicated free exchange between the snow and adjacent mat communities. Other sequences were most similar to those found outside the Canadian Arctic but were from snow, lake and sea ice, glaciers and permafrost, alpine regions, Antarctica, and other regions of the Arctic, supporting the concept of global distribution of microbial ecotypes throughout the cold biosphere.

Spatial and temporal variation in suspended sediment, organic matter, and turbidity in a Minnesota prairie river: implications for TMDLs	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Minnesota River Basin (MRB), situated in the prairie pothole region of the Upper Midwest, contributes excessive sediment and nutrient loads to the Upper Mississippi River. Over 330 stream channels in the MRB are listed as impaired by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, with turbidity levels exceeding water quality standards in much of the basin. Addressing turbidity impairment requires an understanding of pollutant sources that drive turbidity, which was the focus of this study. Suspended volatile solids (SVS), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity were measured over two sampling seasons at ten monitoring stations in Elm Creek, a turbidity impaired tributary in the MRB. Turbidity levels exceeded the Minnesota standard of 25 nephelometric units in 73% of Elm Creek samples. Turbidity and TSS were correlated (r (2) = 0.76), yet they varied with discharge and season. High levels of turbidity occurred during periods of high stream flow (May-June) because of excessive suspended inorganic sediment from watershed runoff, stream bank, and channel contributions. Both turbidity and TSS increased exponentially downstream with increasing stream power, bank height, and bluff erosion. However, organic matter discharged from wetlands and eutrophic lakes elevated SVS levels and stream turbidity in late summer when flows were low. SVS concentrations reached maxima at lake outlets (50 mg/l) in August. Relying on turbidity measurements alone fails to identify the cause of water quality impairment whether from suspended inorganic sediment or organic matter. Therefore, developing mitigation measures requires monitoring of both TSS and SVS from upstream to downstream reaches.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2010	165	1-4					435	447		10.1007/s10661-009-0957-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0957-y								19437124					WOS:000277371000036

Here, based on the updated PRISM4 (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping version 4) boundary conditions from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (PlioMIP2), seven experiments are conducted to simulate the global monsoon in the late Pliocene interglacial period and further investigate the impacts from changes in the individual boundary conditions by using the Community Earth System Model (CESM 1.0.4). The simulated late Pliocene interglacial climate is generally warmer and wetter than the preindustrial period climate, with an expanded monsoon domain, particularly in North Africa, Asia and Australia. The differences in topography, vegetation and lakes outside of Greenland and Antarctica account for the greatest contribution to monsoon changes. Moreover, orbital parameter variations further significantly affect monsoon domains and lead to significant fluctuations in monsoon precipitation and winds on the orbital scale, and the changed magnitude is even larger than that between the late Pliocene and preindustrial period when orbital forcing is not considered.

Compensatory stockings of brown trout have been carried out annually since the mid-1970s. A total of 209 brown trout, which were stocked at the age of 3 yr, were studied for larval cestodes in 1994 and 1995. Diphyllobothrium dendriticum was clearly dominant among the 4 cestode larval species found. The other species were D. ditremum, Triaenophorus crassus and T. nodulosus. After 1 summer in the lake the prevalence of D. dendriticum infection was 75 % (abundance 5.3) and 46% (abundance 0.9) in 1994 and 1995, respectively. After 3 or more years in the lake (greater than or equal to 6+) every brown trout was infected with a mean number of about 130 larvae for both years. All organs in the body cavity were found to be infected. In addition, capsules containing D. dendriticum were found in muscles after the second summer in the lake and the prevalence of muscle infection was 73 % (abundance 3.2) and 95 % (abundance 7.1) in the oldest age group (greater than or equal to 6+) in 1994 and 1995, respectively. This has decreased the commercial value of the brown trout. A slight positive correlation between the number of D. dendriticum and the condition index (Fulton) of fish was found in each age group, although histological studies of heavily infected fish revealed severe chronic granulomatous peritonitis. Indications,of elimination of individuals most heavily parasitized with D. dendriticum were not obtained for the present material. D. dendriticum was not found in the potential prey fishes of the brown trout studied in Lake Inari: vendace Coregonus albula, whitefish Coregonus sp. and nine-spined stickleback Pungitius pungitius.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				OCT 28	1997	31	1					55	63		10.3354/dao031055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao031055													WOS:A1997YK73600007

A framework model for investigating the export of phosphorus to surface waters in forested watersheds: Implications to management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The present study was developed in four sub-basins of rivers Cavado and Douro, located in the North of mainland Portugal. The goal was to identify main stressors as well as driving and attenuating processes responsible for the presence of phosphorus in masses of surface water in those catchments. To accomplish the goal, the basins were selected where a quality station was present at the outlet, the forest occupation was greater than 75% and the phosphorus concentrations have repeatedly exceeded the threshold for the good ecological status in the period 2000-2006. Further, in two basins the quality station was installed in a lotic (free-flow water) environment whereas in the other two was placed in a lentic (dammed water) environment. The ArcMap GIS-based software package was used for the spatial analysis of stressors and processes. The yields of phosphorus vary widely across the studied basins, from 0.2-30 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1). The results point to post-fire soil erosion and hardwood clear cuttings as leading factors of phosphorus exports across the watersheds, with precipitation intensity being the key variable of erosion. However, yields can be attenuated by sediment deposition along the pathway from burned or managed areas to water masses. The observed high yields and concentrations of phosphorus in surface water encompass serious implications for water resources management in the basins, amplified in the lentic cases by potential release of phosphorus from lake sediments especially during the summer season. Therefore, a number of measures were proposed as regards wildfire combat, reduction of phosphorus exports after tree cuts, attenuation of soil erosion and improvement of riparian buffers, all with the purpose of preventing phosphorus concentrations to go beyond the regulatory good ecological status.

THE CARBON CYCLE AND CLIMATE CHANCE: MEMORIES OF MY 60 YEARS IN SCIENCE	GEOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVES												This manuscript presents the development of our current understanding of how the oceans operate and how past climates are reconstructed from the personal viewpoint of the author. It begins with the application of radiocarbon dating of carbonate rocks to deduce past climatic conditions. Age dating of carbonate sedi-ments and microfossils provides a history of sea level rise and fall that closely matches fluctuations in temperature, which in turn correspond with cyclic changes in the Earth's orbit. The origins of our understanding of how ocean circulation can affect global climate are reviewed and the essential role of atmospheric carbon-dioxide content is explored. Central to this climate link is the rate of CO2 flux between the various terrestrial reservoirs including seawater, glacial ice and the terrestrial biota. The manuscript concludes by describing how the collected knowledge about the carbon cycle provides insight into capture of CO2 from the atmosphere with the aim of storing it and attenuating the potentially devastating effects of fossil fuel burning on global climate change.																			2223-7755	2224-2759				APR	2012	1	2					221	340		10.7185/geochempersp.1.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.7185/geochempersp.1.2													WOS:000326941600002

Assessing the potential for Smallmouth Bass population establishment in Grand Canyon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective The expansion of nonnative Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu into the Grand Canyon ecosystem downstream of Glen Canyon Dam is widely seen as a potential threat to native fishes, particularly the Humpback Chub Gila cypha, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. This concern stems from observations in the Green and upper Colorado rivers, where dam-modified habitats and reservoir introductions have allowed Smallmouth Bass to become established and impact native fish species. Our objective was to compare habitat conditions between a Smallmouth Bass population center in the Green River-where Humpback Chub are rare-and two major Humpback Chub population centers in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, where Smallmouth Bass invasion is a conservation concern, to help assess invasion risk and inform management actions downstream of Glen Canyon Dam.Methods We developed a conceptual model of Smallmouth Bass recruitment potential emphasizing the roles of temperature, turbidity, and the timing of these conditions, based on literature for Smallmouth Bass and Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans. Using U.S. Geological Survey gauge station data, we summarized daily temperature and turbidity patterns near a known Smallmouth Bass population center in the middle Green River (near Jensen, Utah) and compared those with conditions in the Colorado River in Glen Canyon and Grand Canyon downstream from Glen Canyon Dam. We then used our conceptual model of Smallmouth Bass early life history, along with observed turbidity and temperature patterns, to explore how irregular recruitment could affect Smallmouth Bass population dynamics and individual growth potential using an age-structured population model and a bioenergetics model.Results Although warm reservoir releases due to low water storage in Lake Powell has made temperature regimes in Glen and Grand canyons more similar to those of the middle Green River, the Colorado River ecosystem in Grand Canyon has a very different turbidity regime from that of the middle Green River. The Colorado River in Grand Canyon becomes very turbid during late summer and fall, when tributaries experience flash floods during the North American monsoon season. These periods of high turbidity coincide with critical early life stages of Smallmouth Bass, likely limiting foraging efficiency, growth, and overwinter survival. Our population model indicates that rapidly growing and sustained Smallmouth Bass populations require successful recruitment at least once every 2 years, but empirical data suggest that these conditions occur only every 5-7 years in Grand Canyon. This would make long-term establishment of self-sustaining Smallmouth Bass populations in Grand Canyon unlikely or at least highly uncertain.Conclusions Despite the presence of nonnative predators, Humpback Chub populations in Grand Canyon have expanded during the past 10-15 years, very likely due to favorably warm river temperature. While Smallmouth Bass in Glen or Marble canyons (between Glen Canyon Dam and the Little Colorado River) may pose a downstream dispersal risk (and potentially a threat to Humpback Chub populations), high turbidity conditions downstream of the Little Colorado River reduce the likelihood of persistent local Smallmouth Bass recruitment. These results suggest that Smallmouth Bass invasion risk to Humpback Chub is not uniform across the Colorado River basin and should be evaluated in the context of the different site-specific water quality and flow regime conditions, other known risks to Humpback Chub, and Humpback Chub population size in different parts of the basin. Smallmouth Bass pose a potential but context-dependent threat to Humpback Chub in the Grand Canyon ecosystem. High turbidity in Grand Canyon downstream of the Little Colorado River may act as a natural barrier to sustained Smallmouth Bass recruitment, suggesting that risk assessments and management actions should be location-specific, include multiple abiotic and biotic factors, and be informed by long-term environmental conditions and time horizons.

The Dal Lake situated in Kangra re-entrant is selected as a reference lake to compare the physiochemical parameters of two lakes. During the month of April, the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, F-, Br-, and HCO3- were found to be dominant at the Rewalsar, rather than the Dal Lake. However, the SO42- and Cl- were noticed more at Dal Lake which may be due to the lithological abundance of dolomite and gypsum minerals. The box and scatter plots indicated similar pattern of variations in the physiochemical parameters from these lakes. Although the dissolved oxygen (DO) at Dal Lake was observed lowest from May to June (5.3-5.4 mg l(-1)), and it was above the stress level for fishes. The temperature during April in the Rewalsar Lake increased to 25 degrees C, which decreased the oxygen holding capacity of water; therefore, DO level dropped to 1.5 mg l(-1). The bottom deposited and floating organic material degradation, induced by rise in temperature further promoted the dissolved oxygen depletion and turned the lake greenish as well as blackish colored. The Rewalsar Lake thus turned hypoxic, and an extensive mass of fishes abruptly perished from the lake in April, which may further be considered a main limiting factor for the fish kills, repetitively ever since a long time period from April to June.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG 28	2020	13	17							872	10.1007/s12517-020-05792-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05792-y													WOS:000567415700003
J	Hall, CJ; Burns, CW				Hall, CJ; Burns, CW			Effects of salinity and temperature on survival and reproduction of Boeckella hamata (Copepoda: Calanoida) from a periodically brackish lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The freshwater calanoid copepod Boeckella hamata Brehm, occurs periodically in Lake Waihola, New Zealand, a shallow, tidally-influenced lake that experiences daily and seasonal fluctuations in salinity, and seasonal changes in temperature, To determine whether these environmental changes might contribute to the copepod's disappearance from the lake in summer, we tested the survival and egg production of B. hamata at a range of salinities (20-3000 mg l(-1) Cl) and two temperatures (10 degreesC, 20 degreesC). Adults survived for 20 days or more only at salinities less than or equal to 1000 mg l(-1) Cl; survival was higher at 10 degreesC than at 20 degreesC, and higher for females (86% at 10 degreesC, 14% at 20 degreesC) than males (43% at 10 degreesC, 0% at 20 degreesC). The mean total eggs produced per female in three successive clutches decreased with temperature from 20 eggs at 10 degreesC to 15 at 20 degreesC; egg production rates increased however, as clutches were produced more frequently. Staged increases in salinity did not increase copepod survival, indicating that B. hamata adults cannot tolerate the magnitude, or rate, of seasonal fluctuations in salinity to which they are exposed in the lake. We conclude that the ability of B. hamata to tolerate warm, saline conditions influences its presence and role in brackish ecosystems.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN	2001	23	1					97	103		10.1093/plankt/23.1.97	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.1.97													WOS:000167155300011

The stratigraphy and physical properties of the extracted cores are compared in detail with the cores which were extracted from the same sites of the bottom using piston and gravity corers. It has been established that the former cores lack a few meters of sediments. Carbon isotope dating with an accelerating mass spectrometer (AMS) shows that the core from BDP-96-2 lacks sediments formed in the last 35 ka. The Blake excursion at a depth between 7 and 8 m of this core permitted us to estimate the time interval of sediments lost from the core from BDP-96-1, which spans 12 ka.																			0016-7886						1999	40	8					1262	1268																WOS:000082777900013
J	Schmidt, JC; Yackulic, CB; Kuhn, E				Schmidt, John C.; Yackulic, Charles B.; Kuhn, Eric			The Colorado River water crisis: Its origin and the future	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												During much of the 21st century, natural runoff in the Colorado River basin has declined, while consumption has remained relatively constant, leading to historically low reservoir storage. Between January 2000 and April 2023, the amount of water stored in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest reservoirs in the United States, declined by 33.5 million acre feet (41.3 billion cubic meters). As of April 2023, total basin-wide storage was sufficient to support the 21st century average rate of basin-wide consumption for only 15 months. Runoff in spring 2023 is predicted to be large, providing a short-term reprieve. However, it will take four to five additional unusually wet years in succession to refill Lake Powell and Lake Mead if basin-wide water use remains unchanged. Increasing evapotranspiration and dry soils associated with global climate change makes such a scenario unlikely. To stabilize reservoir storage, basin-wide use needs to equal modern runoff. To recover reservoir storage, basin-wide use needs to decline even more. Based on 21st century average runoff, a 13%-20% decline in basin-wide use would allow for stabilization and some reservoir storage recovery. Future policy debate about reservoir operations will inevitably concern whether most, or all, reservoir storage should be in Lake Mead or in Lake Powell. The choice of one or the other will result in significantly different environmental and recreational outcomes for Glen Canyon and the Grand Canyon.

Methods In this study, 42 groundwater samples were collected from springs and wells in dry and wet seasons in 2015. Hydrogeochemical evaluations were made using different diagrams such as Piper and Gibbs diagrams. Groundwater quality was determined by the water quality index method (WQI) and different diagrams. Finally, health risk assessments related to arsenic were performed. Results The dominant water types are Mg-Ca-HCO3 and Mg-HCO3 in the wet season and Mg-HCO3 and Mg-HCO3-CO3 in the dry season. According to calculated WQI values ranged from 24.14 to 56.93 in the wet season ranged from 25.27 to 145.87 in dry season. This situation indicates that the quality of water samples is mostly good both seasons. As-T concentrations were between 2.1-6.3 mu g/L in the dry season and 2.9-10.5 mu g/L in the wet season. The risk of developing cancer due to arsenic exposure in healthy adults or children is very low. But arsenic has high non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic potentially harmful effect in the study area. In addition, water samples are not appropriate for use as drinking water in terms of fertilizers and trace element concentrations. Also, MH will be an important problem in waters that will be used as irrigation water. The use of some samples is not recommended as it may cause crusting on metal surfaces in industrial areas. Conclusions According to the results obtained, the quality of groundwater in the study area should be monitored and the usage areas should be determined accordingly.

J	Wang, H; Zhao, YJ; Wang, X; Liang, DF				Wang, Hua; Zhao, Yijun; Wang, Xiao; Liang, Dongfang			Fluctuations in Cd release from surface-deposited sediment in a river-connected lake following dredging	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Lakes connected to rivers have highly fluctuating hydrological conditions and therefore processes involving the retention and release of heavy metals are complex. Jinshan Lake is a typical river-connected lake in China, was selected to estimate Cd distribution in the surface-deposited sediment after dredging. Sediment samples with low, medium and high Cd contents were collected for annular flume experiments. The shear stress-induced Cd releases from these sediments were explored and incorporated into a numerical model using the finite volume method (FVM). The process of Cd release was studied for different temporal scales by numerical simulation. We observed that, because of the adequate water exchange between Jinshan Lake and the Yangtze River, the high-water year featured the largest annual release of Cd at 8777 kg, which was 2722 kg and 2033 kg higher than that of normal and low-water years, respectively. A balance between the upstreamrunoff and downstream tide resulted in the lowest Cd release in a normal-water year. The Cd release during a tidal cycle fell from 48 kg during the flood season to 11 kg during the dry period, whereas the variation coefficient increased from 0.59 to 0.67 during this period. Dredging project generally reduced the release of Cd from sediment in Jinshan Lake and this impact became more prominent in the presence of sufficient water exchange and strong bed shear stress.

Aside from laboratory and mesocosm studies, limited research has been directed towards the role neonicotinoids may have in structuring aquatic invertebrate communities in field settings. Therefore, we simultaneously collected aquatic invertebrate and surface water samples from 26 wetlands within a highly modified agricultural landscape of Nebraska's Rainwater Basin during spring 2015. Water samples were tested for six different neonicotinoids, nutrients, and physical properties. Trace levels of clothianidin and imidacloprid were the only neonicotinoids detected, occurring in 85% and 15%, respectively, of wetlands sampled. All measurements for clothianidin and imidacloprid were below chronic toxicity benchmarks set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Neonicotinoid concentrations were significantly lower (W-26,W- 0.05 = 42.5) at wetlands with vegetative buffer strips >= 50m wide compared to wetlands with vegetative buffers strips < 50 m. Although neonicotinoids were below benchmark concentrations proposed by government regulations, a significant negative association between neonicotinoid concentrations and aquatic invertebrate biomass was observed across all wetlands studied (Parameter Estimate = -0.031; SE = 0.014).

Three different types of flow evolution are identified namely, full deposition, where all the suspended particles settle after initial transients, continuous reentrainment, where the particles remain in individual jet cores without deposition, and particle interface, where the sediments disperse in the entire bottom layer, forming a lutocline between the turbid lower layer and clear upper layer, regimes. Because of its practical relevance, special attention is given to the particle interface regime. A semiempirical criterion for the appearance of this regime and an expression for the height of the resulting lutocline are delineated. Velocity measurements indicate that the intensity of turbulence above the lutocline is determined by the nature of particle-flow interactions in the sediment layer, characterized by the particle Reynolds number.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018	Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269; 													0733-9429					JUL	1999	125	7					765	770		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1999)125:7(765)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1999)125:7(765)													WOS:000080934800012

Systematic reappraisal of the diminutive Amphora thumensis and the transfer of Halamphora parathumensis to the genus Amphora	DIATOM RESEARCH												Since its description the amphoroid diatom Amphora thumensis has confounded simple taxonomic classification having been assigned to Amphora, Cymbella, and now Halamphora. Taxonomic ambiguity around this taxon stems from its small size and reduced, often contradictory, morphological features. In this investigation, we confirm the taxonomic position of A. thumensis by presenting a four-marker molecular phylogeny for a population collected from a small spring-fed lake in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. Our phylogenetic hypothesis places A. thumensis not within the genus Halamphora, but within the deep branching lineages of Amphora. We discuss this phylogenetic hypothesis in the context of the morphological and ecological diversity of the genus and evaluate the utility of putative diagnostic characters within Amphora. In light of this new evidence, the valid name Amphora thumensis (Mayer) Krieger is identified as the preferred designation for this taxon. Consequently, we transfer the morphologically similar Halamphora parathumensis to Amphora.

To improve the sustainability of agricultural land use, this paper proposes an integrated framework for risk assessment and conflict coordination to cope with these salient challenges at the administrative unit level. This framework is demonstrated using a case study conducted in the Dongting Lake area in China. Drawing upon diverse sources of statistical data concerning agricultural inputs and outputs, water resources and natural hazards as well as questionnaire surveys conducted at the household level, this paper uses the Cobb Douglas production function and the water environmental pressure index to assess food insecurity risk and environmental risk from food production, respectively. A double matrix method is used to characterize the degree of sustainability based on the risk assessment. The results indicate that the overall food security of the region can be maintained in the negligible-risk range. However, rising agro-environmental risks from grain production in the coming years are likely to threaten the sustainability of agricultural land use in most administrative units. It is suggested that optimization of land use patterns and mitigation of natural hazards could be effective approaches to improve the sustainability of local agricultural land use.

The watersheds receive similar atmospheric loadings of H+ and SO42- but are covered by different surficial deposits. The aluminum is measured in four fractions by varying the pH and time conditions during analysis. The resulting classes calculated from these fractions are Class a, containing fast-reacting monomeric aluminum, predominantly inorganic Al3+ and hydroxy compounds; Class b, containing fast-reacting complex aluminum species, mainly inorganic F- complexes and simple organic complexes; Class c, containing slow-reacting amorphous and some polymeric aluminum species; and a class containing a residue of unknown aluminum species adding to the total acid-extractable aluminum. There are significant differences in the distribution of the various aluminum species between the two watersheds, both with depth and in the predominant class identified. The generally higher values measured at one watershed are consistent with the lower carbonate content of the overburden. In both locations it appears that the controlling factor is the pH of the groundwater, with all but Class c species increasing with decreasing pH. The difference between the distributions of aluminum species in groundwater and surface water is under investigation to determine the influence of groundwater-borne aluminum on the surface water into which it flows.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1988	45			1			66	71																WOS:A1988Q784000007
J	Gourley, SA; Liu, RS; Wu, JH				Gourley, Stephen A.; Liu, Rongsong; Wu, Jianhong			Spatiotemporal Distributions of Migratory Birds: Patchy Models with Delay	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS												We derive and analyze a mathematical model for the spatiotemporal distribution of a migratory bird species. The birds have specific sites for breeding and winter feeding, and usually several stopover sites along the migration route, and therefore a patch model is the natural choice. However, we also model the journeys of the birds along the flyways, and this is achieved using a continuous space model of reaction-advection type. In this way proper account is taken of flight times and in-flight mortalities which may vary from sector to sector, and this information is featured in the ordinary differential equations for the populations on the patches through the values of the time delays and the model coefficients. The seasonality of the phenomenon is accommodated by having periodic migration and birth rates. The central result of the paper is a very general theorem on the threshold dynamics, obtained using recent results on discrete monotone dynamical systems, for birth functions which are subhomogeneous. For such functions, depending on the spectral radius of a certain operator, either there is a globally attracting periodic solution, or the bird population becomes extinct. Evaluation of the spectral radius is difficult, so we also present, for the particular case of just one stopover site on the migration route, a veri. able sufficient condition for extinction or survival in the form of an attractive periodic solution. This threshold is illustrated numerically using data from the U.S. Geological Survey on the bar-headed goose and its migration to India from its main breeding sites around Lake Qinghai and Mongolia.					; Al-Omari, Jafar/M-9330-2019	Gourley, Stephen/0000-0001-9270-0757; 													1536-0040						2010	9	2					589	610		10.1137/090767261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090767261													WOS:000278527500012
J	Pavelsky, TM; Smith, LC				Pavelsky, TM; Smith, LC			Spatial and temporal patterns in Arctic river ice breakup observed with MODIS and AVHRR time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The timing of spring river-ice break-up, a major annual event for physical, biological, and human systems on Arctic rivers, has been used to infer regional climate variations over the past century or more. Most observations of ice break-up are recorded as point data taken from selected ground-based stations. It is unknown whether these point observations are fully representative of breakup patterns elsewhere along the course of a river. Here, daily time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images are used to remotely sense spatial and temporal patterns in ice breakup along 1600-3300 km lengths of the Lena, Ob', Yenisey, and Mackenzie Rivers. The first day of predominantly ice-free water is visually identified and mapped for ten years (1992-1993, 1995-1998, and 2000-2003), with a mean precision of +/-1.75 days. The derived breakup dates show high correlation with ground-based observations, although a slight trend towards earlier satellite-derived dates can be traced to differences in the way ice breakup date is defined. Large ice jams are often observed, particularly at confluences, although smaller ice jams may not be visible due to the limited spatial resolution of the imagery used. At the watershed scale, spatial patterns in breakup seem to be primarily governed by latitude, timing of the spring flood wave, and location of confluences with major tributaries. Interestingly, channel-scale factors such as slope, width, and radius of curvature, which are known to influence ice breakup at the reach scale, do not appear to be major factors at the scale observed here. The degree of similarity between interannual trends in breakup date at distant points along a river is generally high, which supports the use of point-scale data to infer regional climate variations. This similarity does not hold true for the Mackenzie River, where substantial spatial differences in breakup trends are observed. A new variable, spatially integrated breakup date (d(i)), uses weighted spatial averaging to provide a more encompassing measure of breakup timing. The Ob' and Yenisey Rivers show similar trends in spatially integrated break-up date from year to year. In contrast, the Mackenzie and Lena show a remarkably consistent negative correlation, here attributed to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index.

[These parameters are thought to reflect the Uroglena americanum concentration, which affects water quality.] Sampling was conducted twice a week in spring and monthly in the other seasons throughout 1 yr in the south basin, and in the same way for 3 yr in the main basin from April 1978 to Dec. 1980. The concentrations of B1, biotin and B12 in water of the main basin over 3 yr ranged from 106.6-4.1, 4.17-0.14 and 5.78-0.19 ng/l, respectively. Those in the south basin ranged from 268.7-9.7, 11.50-0.12 and 6.06-0.20 ng/l, respectively. The concentrations of these vitamins in the south basin of the lake were twice as high as those in the main basin. The concentrations of these 3 types of vitamins in water remarkably changed seasonally in both the north and south basins of the lake and were generally high in Sept. and Oct. at every station in the main basin, except for B1 and biotin in the south basin of the lake.																			0301-4800	1881-7742					1981	27	4					301	309											7328439					WOS:A1981MH02500004

Increased abundance of the non-indigenous zooplanktivore, Bythotrephes longimanus, is strongly correlated with greater spring prey availability in Canadian Shield lakes	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The non-indigenous zooplanktivore, Bythotrephes longimanus, is a large Palaearctic cladoceran that is spreading rapidly in the Great Lakes watershed in North America. As a voracious predator, Bythotrephes can reduce herbivorous cladoceran abundance and diversity; however, the variables that affect its abundance are not well understood. To determine what bottom-up factors are associated with the abundance and seasonal dynamics of established Bythotrephes populations, two Bythotrephes datasets from lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada, were analysed using multiple regression and multivariate analyses: a multi-lake dataset of nine lakes sampled in 2003 and a multi-year dataset of one of these lakes, Harp Lake, sampled from 1994-1998 and 2001-2004. Bottom-up variables tested were Secchi disk depth, epilimnetic temperature, cladoceran (prey) density, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and Chlorophyll a, as well as maximum depth for the multi-lake dataset. In both analyses and datasets, springtime abundance of herbivorous cladocerans was consistently found to be a significant factor associated with Bythotrephes (June-September) abundance; Bythotrephes annual abundance was significantly and positively associated with mean May and June prey abundance, along with mean Secchi disk depth for the multi-lake dataset, and groups of lakes or years with similar Bythotrephes seasonal abundance patterns were predicted by June prey abundance. Additionally, prey availability was the dominant contributor towards changes in weekly Bythotrephes birth rates calculated for two of the study lakes. Our study suggests that prey availability influences Bythotrephes abundance, which provides evidence that Bythotrephes establishment success is affected by the abundance of its prey.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013; Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016	Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654													1387-3547	1573-1464				NOV	2011	13	11			SI		2605	2619		10.1007/s10530-011-0077-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-0077-9													WOS:000296352600013

Drought-driven lake level decline: effects on coarse woody habitat and fishes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Research testing for the effects of climate change on lentic fishes has focused on changing thermal and dissolved oxygen regimes, but has often overlooked potential influences of altered lake levels on littoral habitat availability and species interactions. Natural littoral structures such as coarse woody habitat (CWH) can be critical to fishes for prey production, refuge, and spawning. Drought-driven lake level declines may strand these structures above the waterline and thereby remove them from littoral zones. A prolonged drought in northern Wisconsin, USA, allowed us to test for effects of lake level decline on CWH and the response of a fish community. During our study (2001-2009), the lake level of Little Rock Lake South declined over 1.1 m and >75% of the previously submerged CWH was lost from the littoral zone. The loss of CWH coincided with the forage fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens) falling below detection and reduced growth of the top piscivore (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides). Our study highlights the importance of lake level fluctuations as a mechanism by which climate change may affect aquatic ecosystems and species interactions.

In these two large salt lakes, nine species of Podonidae were found, all of which were fairly euryhaline, except Caspievadne maximowitschi. Further, all of them were thermophilic, except Cornigerius bicornis, Caspievadne maximowitschi, and Pleopis polyphemoides. Sexual reproduction of the Podonidae in these two salt lakes appears to be insignificant. The possibility exists that parthenogenetic females of some species can live and reproduce even during the winter in the southern parts of the lakes. The complete disappearance of the Podonidae from the Aral Sea in 1989-1990 and the later reappearance of Podonevadne camptonyx in the north Aral in 1991, demonstrates that today it is possible to rehabilitate and conserve a small part of this lake.

This approach facilitates fast monitoring of relatively large and spatially heterogeneous waterbodies. Spatial distribution of several parameters (temperature, turbidity and salinity) was revealed in Lake Kinneret by the U-TUMS. The collected data were shown to be a useful tool in defining the processes responsible for the observed distribution patterns, suggesting the occurrence of internal seiching which, in turn, seemed to be the driving force for lake internal nutrient supply to surface water layers during the stratified period. Additionally, three-dimensional monitoring of salinity was demonstrated as a powerful tool for identification of salinity patches in Lake Kinneret for localization of both underwater salt springs and unfocused saline seepages.

The experiment was carried out in late summer when the abundance of picocyanobacteria was of its seasonal maximum (7 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and copepods (Eodiaptomus japonicus) dominated the mesozooplankton assemblage. The grazing rates of a mesozooplankton assemblage on nanoflagellates and picoplankton were determined from changes in apparent growth rates of nanoflagellates and picoplankton with increasing mesozooplankton biomass in incubation bottles. Results indicated that the mesozooplankton assemblage consumed nanoflagellates but not picoplankton directly. Dilution culture experiments revealed that the production of picoplankton was mostly consumed by protozoan grazers in the cell-size fraction of <20 mu m (nanoflagellates). Carbon flux estimates indicated that of total carbon channelled from picoplankton to nanoflagellates (630 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), only 2 % was passed to mesozooplankton. The carbon from nanoflagellates accounted for <5 % of the total carbon consumption by mesozooplankton. Thus, the picoplankton-nanoflagellate-mesozooplankton trophic link was extremely inefficient and contributed little to the production of mesozooplankton dominated by copepods during a picocyanobacterial bloom in Lake Biwa.

Source-to-Sink Evolution of Volcano-Sedimentary Li-B Deposits at Rhyolite Ridge, Southwestern Nevada	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												Volcano-sedimentary lithium (Li) and boron (B) deposits at Rhyolite Ridge, Nevada (USA), are poised for development and represent a critical opportunity to secure domestic supplies of these strategic mineral resources. Despite their significance, the sources of Li and B, the geochemical processes responsible for mineralization, and their connection to a proposed caldera in the central Silver Peak Range remain poorly understood. This study integrates detailed geologic mapping with new petrographic, geochemical, and geochronologic data from mineralized lacustrine strata of the Cave Spring formation and underlying volcanic rocks to assess the source-to-sink evolution of Li-B enrichment at Rhyolite Ridge. The Rhyolite Ridge and Argentite Canyon formations (ca. 6.1-5.8 Ma) consist of peraluminous to metaluminous rhyolitic and trachytic tuffs and lavas that include the distinctive Rhyolite Ridge tuff (ca. 6.0 Ma). These rocks exhibit unusually high Li (mean = 73 ppm; maximum = 352 ppm) and B (mean = 160 ppm; maximum = 817 ppm) concentrations, substantially higher than typical upper continental crust, with no clear correlation between Li and B; mild and spatially variable hydrothermal alteration is characterized by sericite, K-feldspar, or disseminated carbonate, along with depleted rare earth element patterns in more altered samples. Drill hole geochemical data from the overlying Cave Spring formation (ca. 5.8-4.7 Ma) indicate that mineralization occurs in stratiform claystone and marl, characterized by a depletion in transition metals and notable enrichment in Li, B, and other incompatible trace elements at concentrations 6 to 30 times higher than typical upper continental crust. Li and B were likely supplied by supergene weathering of surrounding volcanic rocks, possibly with additional input from early hydrothermal fluid circulation in the basin. We propose a regional stratigraphic correlation of the Rhyolite Ridge tuff supported by a new U-Pb date of 6.05 +/- 0.08 Ma for an Li-enriched rhyolite tuff in the nearby Montezuma Range and strong compositional similarities in mineralogy and geochemistry from both outcrop and subsurface data across Clayton Valley, the Silver Peak Range, and northern Fish Lake Valley. This correlation suggests that the Rhyolite Ridge tuff erupted from a source in the Montezuma Range and was emplaced in an similar to 80-km-long, NW-SE-oriented paleovalley and that it is the probable source of Li in brine and volcano-sedimentary deposits throughout the greater Clayton Valley region.

Climate of the Last Glacial Maximum on the western Olympic Peninsula based on insect paleoecology, palynology, and glacial geology	UNTANGLING THE QUATERNARY PERIOD: A Legacy of Stephen C. Porter	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Climate during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) varied substantially across North America, strongly influencing changes in plant and animal distributions and causing variations in the timing and relative magnitude of ice expansion and recession. The Olympic Peninsula is a mountainous maritime terrain in northwestern Washington, where the climate today is most strongly influenced by Pacific weather systems. However, what about during the LGM, when ice sheets covered most of northern North America? Fossil beetle assemblages of LGM age contain species that currently inhabit riparian and lacustrine habitats in the boreal zone of Canada and Alaska, and in higher elevations in the Cascades and Rocky Mountains. They include three Olophrum species that today are unknown from the Olympic Peninsula. Olophrum consimile is especially well represented, and its occurrence today above 1000 m elevation in the Cascades of northern Washington State indicates summers during the LGM would have been at least 4 degrees C cooler than today. The absence of wood-boring beetles, in contrast to assemblages from deposits correlating with marine isotope stage (MIS) 3, supports an open rather than a forested landscape. The insect fossils also include an undescribed species of a blind trechine ground beetle, likely endemic to the Pacific Northwest with biogeographic affinities to Asia. Pollen and plant macrofossil evidence for a Sitka spruce and mountain hemlock parkland with similarities to the vegetation of modern southeast Alaska also supports an interpretation of a climate with summer temperatures similar to 4 degrees C cooler than today. Both the vegetation and the insects provide evidence that the climate was wet with persistent snow cover and not as dry as has been reported from the Puget Lowland to the east. Glacial geology provides evidence that during the colder climate of the LGM, mountain glaciers advanced down the western valleys of the Olympic Peninsula to the lowlands but not as far as they had extended during MIS 3. The amount of climatic cooling on the Olympic Peninsula during the LGM was less than at similar latitudes in midcontinental or eastern North America, indicating a strong modulation of climate by the Pacific Ocean.

Both species are closely related and are known to form hybrids when held together. Putative hybrids of these species were found in the shallow Bardawil Lagoon on the northern coast of Sinai. The lagoon is unique in the eastern Mediterranean by being totally hypersaline without any brackish or freshwater sections. Samples were obtained using a small mesh-size experimental beach seine between April 1973 and March 1975. Among the 4,600 specimens of killifish examined, 45% belonged to A. dispar, 17% to A. fasciatus, and 38% to their putative hybrids. Seasonal abundance was similar in all three taxa; there were few fish during the winter months and from June to October, abundant fish, mostly juveniles, with peaking in July. Examination of gonads revealed that the reproductive period of the two species is from March to September when water temperatures varied between 21 and 33 degrees C. The hybrids had only rudimentary gonads. The size of A. dispar and the hybrid in the lagoon varied between 25 and 65 mm total length. A. fasciatus was smaller, not exceeding 35 mm, although in other regions it can reach 75 mm.																			0021-2210						1996	42	3					203	213																WOS:A1996VR80100001

From 1937-1977, total dissolved solids increased from 5650-10,650 mg l-1. Ionically, the lake is a chlorocarbonate one; however, as desiccation continues it should eventually have about equal amounts of chloride, sulfate and carbonate. With regard to algal nutrients, the lake appears to be N limited. The phytoplankton is currently dominated by Nodularia spumigena; at times this produces noxious blooms. The zooplankton community is depauperate and composed of 3 spp. The fish fauna is limited to 3 endemic fishes, with tui chub, Gila bicolor, dominant. Lahontan cutthroat trout, Salmo clarki henshawi, is restricted during summer to a narrow mid-water zone low enough in temperature and high enough in dissolved O2 to meet physiological requirements.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	118	3					275	292		10.1007/BF00046625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00046625													WOS:A1984AAP9900006

Coordinated hydrological regimes in the Indo-Pacific region during the past two millennia	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Instrumental data suggest that major shifts in tropical Pacific atmospheric dynamics and hydrology have occurred within the past century, potentially in response to anthropogenic warming. To better understand these trends, we use the hydrogen isotopic ratios of terrestrial higher plant leaf waxes ( delta D(wax)) in marine sediments from southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia, to compile a detailed reconstruction of central Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) hydrologic variability spanning most of the last two millennia. Our paleodata are highly correlated with a monsoon reconstruction from Southeast Asia, indicating that intervals of strong East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) activity are associated with a weaker Indonesian monsoon (IM). Furthermore, the centennial-scale oscillations in our data follow known changes in Northern Hemisphere climate ( e. g., the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period) implying a dynamic link between Northern Hemisphere temperatures and IPWP hydrology. The inverse relationship between the EASM and IM suggests that migrations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and associated changes in monsoon strength caused synoptic hydrologic shifts in the IPWP throughout most of the past two millennia.

The studied lakes seem to be especially favourable for Pediastrum, with a total of eight species (15 taxa) in the phytoplankton noted during the summer. However, the relative frequency of the genus in the overall algal communities was low. The most frequent species were P. boryanum, P. kawraiskyi and P. duplex and these were accompanied by cyanobacteria, coccal green algae (Chlorophyceae, Chlorococcales) and diatoms (Bacillariophyceae).

During the concentrating period of Meiyu precipitation for 1998, its meridional oscillation was closely related to variations of episodes of heavy rainfalls in this region. 4) The low-level easterly aircurrent to the north of the low-level southerly jet played an important role in maintenance of the frontal zone! which is also one of major factors leading to the persistent heavy rainfalls in middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. 5) The formation of the low-level jets is different in the synoptic conditions for 1998 and 1999. This difference mainly resulted from the different zonal positions of the subtropical high and activities of the summer monsoon. 6) There existed a succession of meso-scale disturbances (at least 2 and 3 meso-scale vortices for 1998 and 1999, respectively) along the Meiyu frontal zones, which mostly originated in the eastern flank of the Tibetan plateau and migrated eastward, with vortex centers located to the north of the low-level jet axis and heavy rainfalls in the southeast of the disturbances. 7) Along the Meiyu front, there was a high humidity and lower temperature conditions, while relatively dry and higher temperature conditions existed to south and north of the Meiyu front. This kind of sandwich-like temperature and humidity condition is important for the Meiyu maintenance; Zonally, the temperature field was characterized by lower temperature in the west and higher temperature in the east along the Meiyu frontal zone. 8) During the processes of heavy rains in 1998 and 1999, the patterns and the magnitudes of Q(1) and Q(2) are nearly similar to each other, indicating that the heating over the heavy rain regions was created by the moisture condensation process, due mainly to convective 'activities. However, it is now not clear how this prosess of energy and water cycle may in turn affect events of heavy rainfalls through feedback effect. The above indications of the large-scale circulation features and synaptic systems provide a starting point for further investigation of the energy and water cycle over the Huaihe River Basin.																			0026-1165	2186-9057				MAR	2001	79	1B					277	300																WOS:000168707000003

(Asteraceae) in northwest Iran and a key to the world species associated with Artemisia spp.	BIOLOGIA												To fill the gap of eriophyoid mites in Iran, a field survey was carried out in northwest Iran (Aras dam lake, West Azerbaijan Province), in summer 2022. As a result, a new vagrant Aceria species (Acari: Eriophyoidea: Eriophyidae) associated with Artemisia scoparia Waldst. & Kit. (Asteraceae) was discovered. The new species is illustrated and described herein as Aceria artemipariasp. n. No apparent damage was observed on the host. This is the second report of an eriophyoid mite species associated to A. scoparia host plant. Aceria artemipariasp. n. is unique among 24 Aceria spp. associated with Artemisia species by having a smooth prodorsal shield and 8-rayed empodium. Furthermore, we provided a checklist and morphological key of eriophyoid mites associated with Artemisia spp. of the world.					khabir, zahra/E-8565-2018; Xue, Xiao-Feng/P-2046-2015; namaghi, hussein/M-6394-2018	Xue, Xiao-Feng/0000-0002-6374-8601; hashemi khabir, zahra/0000-0003-3007-5233; Lotfollahi, Parisa/0000-0003-3139-8149; 													0006-3088	1336-9563				AUG	2024	79	8					2471	2477		10.1007/s11756-024-01721-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-024-01721-6		JUL 2024											WOS:001265444900002

The maximum number of prawns eaten by a Nile perch increased steadily, from 10 prawns for a fish in the 5-9.9 cm length group, to 913 prawns in a fish in the 60-69.9 cm length group, and then fell sharply for larger fish. The mean number of Caridina eaten by fish that were foraging on this animal followed a similar trend. Gill raker spacing increased in direct proportion to fish length and this may prevent fish larger than 70 cm in length from being effective prawn predators.																			0378-1909					MAR	1992	33	3					307	309		10.1007/BF00005875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005875													WOS:A1992HM34500010

The magnitude of response, however, is very small. Increased diatom accumulation and modified species composition indicates some relaxation of silica limitation, particularly in early spring. Abundance of some diatom species associated with grossly polluted areas of the Great Lakes has been reduced, but most recently deposited assemblages are composed of species tolerant of eutrophic conditions. No reappearance of species assemblages abundant in Lake Ontario prior to 1935 and presently associated with oligotrophic conditions in the upper Great Lakes were noted.

J	Liu, Y; Ji, XL; Zhou, LZ				Liu, Yuan; Ji, Xianglin; Zhou, Lizhi			Assessment of Waterbird Habitat Importance and Identification of Conservation Gaps in Anhui Province	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Wetlands are one of the most important habitats for waterbirds. Due to the increase in human activities, waterbird habitats have been severely disturbed. Limited availability of human and natural resources makes effective habitat protection particularly important. Therefore, in this study, we developed an index system to evaluate habitat waterbird importance in Anhui Province based on habitat status. This allowed us to identify distribution and change patterns over time in important waterbird habitats. We also examined gaps in the protection of these crucial habitats and identified the key environmental influences. We found that Anhui Province has 73 important waterbird habitats, mainly concentrated in the Yangtze River floodplain. Gap analysis showed that 42 of these suffered from protection gaps, accounting for 57.53% of the total area. The importance of waterbird habitats was significantly correlated with elevation, normalized vegetation index, lake area, and lake circumference but not with distance from roads or population density. This study presents scientific information for waterbird habitat conservation in Anhui Province and provides reference cases for waterbird habitat conservation and maintaining wetland ecosystem functions.Abstract Wetlands are among the most important habitats of highly wetland-dependent waterbirds but are subject to ongoing habitat loss and degradation owing to intensified anthropogenic activities. The scarcity of human and natural resources makes effective habitat protection an important concern. Here, we aimed to investigate waterbird habitat protection methods for Anhui Province, China, a critical stopover and wintering area on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway that features rich wetland resources subject to significant habitat loss and degradation. We evaluated the status and importance of 306 wintering waterbird habitats and identified the key environmental influences and current protection gaps using the entropy weights method and generalized additive modeling. We found 73 important habitats for waterbirds in Anhui Province, which were classified into levels of importance (descending from I to V) according to the natural discontinuity method. Level I and Level II habitats were mainly located in the Yangtze River floodplain and Level IV habitats in the Huaihe River floodplain. The gap analysis showed that 42 important waterbird habitats had protection gaps, accounting for 57.53% of the total area. Waterbird habitat importance was significantly correlated with elevation, normalized vegetation index, lake area, and lake circumference but not with distance from roads or population density. The results of this study provide scientific information for waterbird habitat conservation planning, which is crucial for maintaining wetland ecosystem functions.					xianglin, ji/AAI-2277-2019; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021														2076-2615					APR	2024	14	7							1004	10.3390/ani14071004	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14071004								38612243					WOS:001200873700001
J	Morton, B; Velkovrh, F; Sket, B				Morton, B; Velkovrh, F; Sket, B			Biology and anatomy of the 'living fossil' Congeria kusceri (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) from subterranean rivers and caves in the Dinaric karst of the former Yugoslavia	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The cave-dwelling Congeria kusceri is described and aspects of its unique ancestry and biology elucidated in the context of its, for a bivalve, similarly unique habitat. The species lives in subterranean waters of the Dinaric karst of the former Yugoslavia. C. kusceri is acutely heteromyarian in form commensurate upon its lifestyle of byssal attachment to the walls of either permanently or periodically inundated karst caves. Shells are sometimes covered by travertine, precipitated calcium carbonate, and the tubes of the, similarly unique, serpulid Marifugia cavatica. Neither species occurs outside such caves and, as a consequence, the shell and tissues of C. kusceri are colourless and there are few sense organs, i.e. no statocysts and light receptors, although the pallial papillae possess tiny sense cells and there is a supra-branchial osphradium. Mantle fusions are extensive and involve the inner folds posteriorly to create the siphons, but also the inner surfaces of the middle folds ventrally so that here the mantle is largely covered by a thin (4-5 mu m), fibrous, periostracum and there are, on the separated middle folds around the pedal gape, external ciliary cleansing tracts. There are internal cleansing tracts too, but the former have been identified, hitherto, only in representatives of the Pectinidae. In terms of general anatomy, Congeria kusceri has large ctenidia and tiny labial palps as an adaptation to the mineral waters of its habitat containing little food and, thus, that little is rejected when collected. There are few sorting currents in the stomach either and the intestine is short. The aragonitic shell comprises two layers, outer and inner, both with a homogeneous crossed-lamellar structure. Each shell valve, however, contains many growth checks, represented by thin prismatic layers. Assuming that a growth check is formed once each year, possibly in late summer when water levels fall in the caves, making them accessible for investigation, an individual of, for example 12.7 mm shell length, was possibly 25 years of age. If so, an individual of 25 mm would be very much older. Because, with age, the species lays down growth checks at progressively reduced increments, a lifespan of many decades may be possible. Extreme reduction in shell growth causes marginal thickening and incurving. The species is dioecious, i.e. separate sexes, with females brooding lecithotrophic (70 mu m) eggs in the ctenidia, the filament bases of which become highly glandular. Mature and brooding individuals occur when water levels are low in the caves, suggesting that internal fertilization takes place at this time too, sperm transfer being in the film of surrounding water to prevent loss. Fertilized eggs probably hatch either as larvae with a short planktotrophic life or as crawl-away juveniles. Analysis of large samples suggests that recruitment is probably low, and there is evidence that the species is threatened by pollution of its habitat.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				JUN	1998	245		2				147	174																WOS:000075199000004

Considering their ecological importance, wetlands are rightly appraised as 'natural kidneys'. In this current study, the city wetlands of Guwahati were viewed for the first time through the angle of lesser explored bottom dwellers. Guwahati, a rapidly expanding metropolis, is the gateway to northeast India, part of an Indian biodiversity hot-spot region. This case study comprised the bridge between abiotic and biotic factors, thus directing the pave for characterization of wetlands through benthos analysis. The study, covering seasons, viz. winter, premonsoon and monsoon, revealed 15 definite taxa belonging to 10 orders. The dominance of Chironomidae and Culicidae in certain wetlands indicated high tolerance of Dipterans in a wide range of aquatic environments, including polluted water bodies. Similarly, the presence of Trichopterans, only in the wetland located distant from the mainland city, marked that with less anthropogenic impacts. The Shannon indices for benthos were in the range from 0.17 to 0.97. Density was found to have a significant positive correlation with dissolved oxygen (r = 0.567) and a negative correlation with free carbon dioxide (r = -0.377). In contrast to significant site wise variation in density, there was no significant difference in benthic diversity across the sites and no significant seasonal variation of benthic density and diversity from the statistical point of view.

We report results of a detailed study on the occurrence, sources and fate of aromatic hydrocarbons and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in a typical holomictic lake, Lake Zurich, that supplies drinking water for the largest Swiss city. Emphasis of the investigation was on the fuel oxygenate MTBE, which was found in concentrations up to 1.4 mug/L in the epilimnion and up to 0.05 mug/L in the hypolimnion of the lake. The concentration difference was due to the stratification of the lake during the boating season with very limited water exchange across the thermocline. MTBE and BTEX nearly completely volatilized before vertical take mixing occurred in winter. Spatial and temporal variations of MTBE concentrations in the lake were observed and successfully predicted using two complementary box models (MASAS Light and Aquasim). The drinking water supply from holomictic lakes is not at risk for the scenarios studied if water is extracted from well below the thermocline. Since emissions of unburned gasoline into such water bodies are caused predominantly by boating activities, restrictions of highly emitting two-stroke engines could substantially reduce the MTBE and BTEX load of the epilimnion during the boating season.

Spatial and seasonal variations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the Arctic atmosphere	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Weekly high-volume air samples were collected between 2000 and 2003 at six Arctic sites, i.e., Alert, Kinngait, and Little Fox Lake (LFL) in Canada, Point Barrow in Alaska, Valkarkai in Russia, and Zeppelin in Norway. Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were quantified in all samples. Comparison showed that alpha-HCH and HCB were homogeneously distributed in the circumpolar atmosphere and uniform throughout the seasons. However, significantly higher atmospheric concentrations of alpha-HCH and HCB and stronger temperature dependence of alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH were found at LFL in Yukon (YK), which is unique among the sites by virtue of its high altitude and low latitude, resulting in higher precipitation rates and summer temperatures. Strong temperature dependence of alpha- and gamma-HCH at this location suggests that secondary emissions, i.e., re-evaporation from surfaces, were more important at this site than others. It is hypothesized that a higher precipitation rate at LFL facilitated the transfer of alpha-HCH from the atmosphere to surface media when technical HCH was still in use worldwide. On the other hand, higher temperature at LFL enhanced re-evaporation to the atmosphere after the global ban of technical HCH. In contrast to alpha-HCH and HCB, larger spatial and seasonal differences were seen for gamma-HCH (a currently used pesticide), which likely reflect the influence of different primary contaminant sources on different Arctic locations. Fugacity ratios suggest a net deposition potential of HCB from air to seawater, whereas seawater/air exchange direction of alpha-HCH varies in the circumpolar environment.

J	Valdiya, KS				Valdiya, KS			Late Quaternary movements and landscape rejuvenation in southeastern Karnataka and adjoining Tamil Nadu in Southern Indian Shield	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Late Quaternary movements on N-S trending segmented faults in the Southern Indian Shield have given rise to en echelon linear hills and isolated hillocks that abruptly rise 300 to 400m above the 900 m Bangalore peneplain covered thickly with red soil. and are made up of remarkably fresh Precambrian rocks devoid of soil capping. Tilting of soil-covered regolith on the fault-delimited hill flanks together with extraordinarily severe gully erosion in the confines of narrow fault zones bear testimony to continuing movements on these active faults, which also gave rise to many tectonic lakes following stream pending. Further south, > 1800 m high Biligirirangan-Mahadeswaramalai Hills represent fault-lined horsts, drained by meandering streams that fall and cascade down their steep scarps. Folding of Recent fluvial gravel, development of spectacular knee bend in an otherwise very straight fault valley, and abrupt pronounced northward shift of the Kaveri River from its original southeasterly course indicate Holocene movements on the faults delimiting the horsts. The >2500 m high Nilgiri massif amidst the 300-150 m Tirupattur-Coimbatore plain is characterized by gently undulating top with very thick soil cover and lazily flowing streams that drop down precipitous scarps (of 1800 to 2000 m sheer fall) through chasms and gorges. Ponding of streams due to reactivation of faults gave rise to lakes comprising 20,000 to 5000 year-old peat within black clays. Thrusting up of the Nilgiri block on the E-W oriented Moyar Shear Zone (which separates the Southern Granulite Terrane from the Dharwar Craton) is a continuing phenomenon, as evident from spectacular rejuvenation of meandering streams, development of multitudes of deep demes and waterfalls, presence of unfurrowed straight planar valley slopes, and recurrent seismicity in the Moyar Shear Zone. The thrust movements on the E-W shear zones have been, and are being transmitted northwards as strike-slip and oblique-slip movements on the N-S trending faults in the Dharwar Craton. Close association of epicentres with the fault zones implies that the strain accumulated in the Peninsular Shield is being relaxed through reactivation of these active faults of Precambrian antiquity.																			0016-7622					FEB	1998	51	2					139	166																WOS:000071874500002

Major hydrological changes, which affected the main physical and chemical features, were observed in the stream according to the meltwater pulses. The enrichment of the stream by seabird inputs was evident from the high nutrient concentrations and their increase downstream. The presence of a snowbank in the middle reach produced a major discontinuity influencing the main variables analyzed. The stream showed a similar algal composition to other water courses of Hope Bay, with Prasiola crispa, Hydrurus foetidus, Phaeogloea mucosa and Phormidium fragile as the dominant species.

A simple modification of the model accounts well for the effects of ice cover. The modified model predicts that, all else being equal, the oxygen regimes of eutrophic lakes will tend to be affected more by ice cover than those of oligotrophic lakes; that a short period of ice cover is of no great consequence for the oxygen regime of the lake, whereas a long period of ice cover results in a disproportionately large decrease in the mean lake oxygen concentration; and that the later break-up occurs, the greater will be the effect of the ice cover on the oxygen regime of the lake.																			0020-9309						1993	78	4					465	480		10.1002/iroh.19930780402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780402													WOS:A1993MP82600001

Enzyme activities peaked in summer. This phenomenon can be attributed to high temperature and sediment organic matter accumulation, which could be traced to the breakdown of algal bloom. In addition, sediment enzyme activities exhibited apparent spatial heterogeneity across the lake, but individual enzymes showed similar spatial patterns of activity. Moreover, sediment enzyme activities were found to be closely related to the water quality of Erhai Lake. Enzyme activities were also significantly correlated with sediment total nitrogen and organic matter, implying that the sediment enzyme can be used as a biological indicator that reflects the sediment status. The investigation of sediment enzyme activities can facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the process of nutrient cycling and the mechanisms underlying lake eutrophication.

J	Sakata, M; Marumoto, K				Sakata, M; Marumoto, K			Wet and dry deposition fluxes of mercury in Japan	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Wet and dry deposition fluxes of mercury were measured concurrently from December 2002 to November 2003 at 10 sites in Japan (nine sites for dry deposition measurements). Precipitation and dry deposition (gases and particles) were collected every half-month using an automatic wet and dry deposition sampler. This sampler is composed of a precipitation sampler and a water surface sampler for dry deposition. The results showed that wet deposition fluxes of mercury increase generally during summer when the precipitation amount increases. In contrast, the seasonal variations of the dry deposition fluxes were very small compared to those of the wet deposition fluxes. It was found that wet deposition plays a dominant role in mercury deposition in Japan, contributing fluxes ranging from 0.99 to 2.2 times (1.6 times on average at nine sites) those of the dry deposition fluxes. There was a high correlation between the annual wet deposition flux of mercury and annual precipitation amount (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.01). Thus, about 70% of the variance of mercury wet deposition in Japan is explained by precipitation amount. This is probably because mercury wet deposition is dominated by the scavenging of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) by precipitation via oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg-0) in the gas and aqueous phases. In addition, a similar relationship between the annual wet deposition flux and precipitation amount (r(2) = 0.55, P < 0.001) was observed at the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) sites in North America, suggesting that about 55% of the variance of mercury wet deposition is due to precipitation amount.

J	Khim, BK; Jung, HM; Cheong, D				Khim, BK; Jung, HM; Cheong, D			Recent variations in sediment organic carbon content in Lake Soyang (Korea)	LIMNOLOGY												Four gravity cores were taken from Lake Soyang, which was created by the construction of an artificial dam in 1973. The variation of organic carbon content of the bottom sediments since the construction was interpreted using a variety of sedimentological and geochemical measurements. Based on the textural properties of sediments and the total organic carbon (TOC) content, it is clear that sediment organic carbon has been deposited very consistently throughout the postconstruction period, except for local sudden inputs caused by summer flooding events near fish farms or farmland areas. The autochthonous input resulting from the enhanced primary production led by phytoplanktons each year is likely to become a major problem at downstream sites within Lake Soyang. The vertical variation of VC values of sediment organic matter also reflects the fact that the level of autochthonous supply of organic carbon becomes high downstream.																			1439-8621					APR	2005	6	1					61	66		10.1007/s10201-004-0134-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0134-5													WOS:000228456000008
J	Watson, V; Kooi, H; Bense, V				Watson, Vanessa; Kooi, Henk; Bense, Victor			Potential controls on cold-season river flow behavior in subarctic river basins of Siberia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Results are presented of an inter-basin comparison of cold-season (October-April/March) river flow characteristics for 17 undisturbed catchments in Siberia for the period 1980-1998. Flow and recession metrics for each basin and mean annual cold-season catchment-averaged drainage depth, Q(cold) (mm), were analyzed with various basin attributes in an attempt to detect potential controls of recession behavior. There is a marked behavioral distinction between basins on non-continuous (n = 6) permafrost coverage (discontinuous/sporadic/isolated) and those on continuous (n = 11) permafrost. The first group is characterized by slow recession, relatively high discharge in April before spring freshet, and high values for Q(cold) up to about 80 mm, which corresponds to more than 10% of total annual rainfall. Although positive correlations with several catchment attributes (annual precipitation regime; peat land fraction) are found, higher abundance of through-taliks and greater active layer depth (ALD) are presumed to be the most likely controls of the distinctive hydrological behavior of catchments containing non-continuous permafrost. Within the group of catchments on continuous permafrost, characteristics of cold-season flow vary conspicuously as some rivers exhibit very fast recession and cessation of flow for 3-4 months, while others show strongly reduced, but continuous discharge throughout the cold season. Our analysis shows that lake area fraction, peatland fraction and morphological metrics may play a role in favoring prolonged cold-season flow in this group. Whether prolonged cold-season flow in areas of continuous permafrost also signals contributions to river flow from intra- and/or sub-permafrost groundwater remains an intriguing but so far unresolved question.

However, far more is known about which groups are dominant than about the cellular processes they perform in order to become dominant. In the Southern Ocean, eukaryotic phytoplankton are the dominant primary producers. In this study we used metagenomics and metaproteomics to determine how the dominant bacterial and archaeal plankton processed bloom material. We examined the microbial community composition in 14 metagenomes and found that the relative abundance of Flavobacteria (dominated by Polaribacter) was positively correlated with chlorophyll a fluorescence, and the relative abundance of SAR11 was inversely correlated with both fluorescence and Flavobacteria abundance. By performing metaproteomics on the sample with the highest relative abundance of Flavobacteria (Newcomb Bay, East Antarctica) we defined how Flavobacteria attach to and degrade diverse complex organic material, how they make labile compounds available to Alphaproteobacteria (especially SAR11) and Gammaproteobacteria, and how these heterotrophic Proteobacteria target and utilize these nutrients. The presence of methylotrophic proteins for archaea and bacteria also indicated the importance of metabolic specialists. Overall, the study provides functional data for the microbial mechanisms of nutrient cycling at the surface of the coastal Southern Ocean.					; Wilkins, David/AAT-1802-2020; DeMaere, Matthew/D-9002-2012; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/D-4341-2013	LONG, Emilie/0000-0003-0922-381X; DeMaere, Matthew/0000-0002-7601-5108; Wilkins, David/0000-0002-3385-8981; Cavicchioli, Ricardo/0000-0001-8989-6402; Williams, Timothy/0000-0002-2738-3019													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAY	2013	15	5			SI		1302	1317		10.1111/1462-2920.12017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12017								23126454					WOS:000318041800006

Using daily precipitation observation data from 108 meteorological stations during 1960-2020, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in the Dongting Lake Basin (DLB) are revealed, and the mechanisms driving extreme precipitation variation in the DLB are investigated. The results showed that with the increase in the frequency, intensity and amount of extreme precipitation, the DLB is trending towards increased humidity. However, consecutive wet days have declined significantly at a rate of -0.015 days/year, indicating that more short-duration but high-intensity extreme precipitation are likely to occur in the future. These changes have intensified with the increase in regional average warming. In contrast, the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) amplifies changes in extreme precipitation through nonlinear enhancement mechanisms, particularly when interacting with other climate drivers. Additionally, extreme precipitation exhibits a sensitive response to elevation. Specifically, low-altitude areas tend to experience more frequent and intense extreme events, whereas high-altitude regions are more prone to short-duration heavy rainfall. The fastest growth in extreme precipitation was observed in the hilly-valley transition zone between the northern Xuefeng Mountains and southern Wuling Mountains. At the sub-basin level, the Lishui River Basin exhibits relatively minor variations in most extreme precipitation indices, while the Xiangjiang River Basin records the greatest increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation. These patterns may be explained by differences in the categories of dominant climate drivers and the strength of their associated impacts.

Reconstructing past atmospheric circulation changes using oxygen isotopes in lake sediments from Sweden	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Here we use lake sediment studies from Sweden to illustrate how Holocene-aged oxygen isotope records from lakes located in different hydrological settings, can provide information about climate change. In particular changes in precipitation, atmospheric circulation and water balance. We highlight the importance of understanding the present lake hydrology, and the relationship between climate variables and the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation ( delta O-18(p)) and lake waters (delta O-18(lakewater)) for interpretation of the oxygen isotopic record from the sediments (delta O-18). Both precipitation reconstructions from Northern Sweden and water balance reconstructions from South and Central Sweden show that the atmospheric circulation changed from zonal to a more meridional airflow over the Holocene. Superimposed on this Holocene trend are delta O-18(p) minima resembling intervals of the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), thus suggesting that the climate of Northern Europe is strongly influenced by atmospheric and oceanic circulation changes over the North Atlantic.

To study the effects of seawater flow on the convective heat transfer, experiments are performed at the bottom and surface of the seawater. The heat transfer coefficients of the HCHE in seawater are studied in this article in consideration of the flow of seawater. The effects of parameters such as the water-inlet temperature and the velocity in the HCHE on heat transfer are discussed with respect to cooling and heating conditions. In addition, the heat transfer analysis of the HCHE in icy conditions in winter is performed. The results show that 90% of the transferred heat energy is transported on the first 50m of the HCHE. The external convective heat transfer coefficients under various conditions are calculated iteratively.

For most village residents, the Maoist era was a period of attacks on their religious beliefs and practices. It was also a time of often costly attempts to secure a more reliable supply of water. Village politics and factional disputes attended all these efforts and closely track the rise, fall, and ultimate reinstatement of the Ninth Dragon God, an important deity in Chinese pantheon, who many believe has full charge of rainwater, rivers, lakes, and seas. Those associated with the god constitute a source of authority and respect in addition to that of local state sanctioned leaders.																			0300-7839	1572-9915				FEB	2011	39	1			SI		81	91		10.1007/s10745-011-9378-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-011-9378-y													WOS:000288258500009

Limnological analyses revealed that the lake had,despite a 3 m thick ice cover, a completely mixed water column during austral summer 2001/2002. High oxygen contents, low ion concentrations, and lack of planktonic diatoms throughout the water column indicate that Radok Lake is ultra-oligotrophic today. The late glacial and postglacial lake history is documented in a succession of glacial, glaciolimnic, and limnic sediments at different locations in the lake basin. The sediments record regional differences and past changes in allochthonous sediment supply and lake productivity. However, the lack of age control on these changes, due to extensive sediment redeposition and the lack of applicable dating methods, excluded Radok Lake sediments for advanced paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

However, studies on relationships between AAPB and cyanobacterial blooms are in scarcity. The dynamics of the abundance and diversity of AAPB was compared based on pufM gene in Meiliang Bay (featured by cyanobacterial blooms) and East Bay (featured by macrophyte) of Taihu Lake, a shallow subtropical lake in the East China plain. AAPB abundance was not significantly different between the two sites, and they were positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The ratios of AAPB to total bacteria varied from 3.4% to 11.5% and peaked in winter in both sites. No significant differences of AAPB community compositions were detected between the two sites, but there was a separation between warm seasons (June, August, and October) and cold seasons (December, February, and April). Rhizobiales and Limnohabitans-like pufM sequences were significantly contributors for the difference between two seasons, and specially enriched in cold seasons. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and DOC were the most significant variables influencing the AAPB community structure. Furthermore, Porphyrobacter and Rhodospirillales-like pufM sequences were positively correlated with Chl a, indicating potential influence of cyanobacterial blooms on these AAPB taxa. These results suggested that diverse AAPB ecotypes coexisted in Taihu Lake, and their ecological role in carbon cycling in the lake may not be ignored.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023														2096-5508	2523-3521				SEP	2022	40	5			SI		1855	1867		10.1007/s00343-022-1348-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-022-1348-2		JUL 2022											WOS:000824950200008
J	Takano, B; Zheng, Q; Ohsawa, S				Takano, B; Zheng, Q; Ohsawa, S			A telemetering system for monitoring aqueous polythionates in an active crater lake	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We have developed an in-situ monitoring system for aqueous polythionates in the Yugama crater lake at Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. A commercially available nitrate-selective electrode has a Nemstian response to the concentration of polythionates in solution in the range of pH 2.5-11. However, many active crater lakes contain highly acidic water (pH ranges from 0.2 to 2). The monitoring system reduces the acidity of the lake water to pH 4 without changing the concentration of polythionates using a high efficiency cation-exchange membrane technique. The monitoring system was placed in a submersed station, because the Yugama surface lake water freezes in mid-winter. The system is described and preliminary data are reported.

This peculiar situation makes Taal prone to frequent, and sometimes catastrophic, hydrovolcanic eruptions. Fumaroles, hot springs, and lake waters were sampled in 1991, 1992, and 1995 in order to develop a geochemical model for the hydrothermal system. The low-temperature fumarole compositions indicate strong interaction of magmatic vapors with the hydrothermal system under relatively oxidizing conditions. The thermal waters consist of highly, moderately, and weakly mineralized solutions, but none of them corresponds to either water-rock equilibrium or rock dissolution. The concentrated discharges have high Na contents (>3500 mg/kg) and low SO4/Cl ratios (<0.3). The Br/Cl ratio of most samples suggests incorporation of seawater into the hydrothermal system. Water and dissolved sulfate isotopic compositions reveal that the Main Crater Lake and spring discharges are derived from a deep parent fluid (T approximate to 300 degrees C), which is a mixture of seawater, volcanic water, and Lake Taal water. The volcanic end member is probably produced in the magmatic-hydrothermal environment during absorption of high-temperature gases Into groundwater. Boiling and mixing of the parent water give rise to the range of chemical and isotopic characteristics observed in the thermal discharges, Incursion of seawater from the coastal region to the central part of the volcano is supported by the low water levels of the lakes and by the fact that Lake Taal was directly connected to the China sea until the sixteenth century:. The depth to the seawater-meteoric water interface is calculated to be 80 and 160 m for the Main Crater Lake and Lake Taal, respectively. Additional data are required to infer the hydrologic structure of Taal, Geochemical surveillance of the Main Crater Lake using the SO4/Cl, Na/K or Mg/Cl ratio cannot be applied straightforwardly due to the presence of seawater in the hydrothermal system.

Societal Benefits of the Real-Time Coastal Observation Network (ReCON): Implications for Municipal Drinking Water Quality	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Environmental conditions on Lake Erie in summer 2006 produced hypoxic waters (1.2 mg/l dissolved oxygen), with characteristic low pH (7.2), low temperature (18 degrees C) and high manganese levels, negatively impacting water processing at the Cleveland Water Department.

Internal waves initiated by winds can propagate around the central basin of Lake Erie for several days explaining the cyclical nature of the event. Future deployments of a ReCON buoy system in Lake Erie's central basin will provide real-time observations of temperature and dissolved oxygen to water department managers.

Stimulation of Lake Michigan plankton metabolism by sediment resuspension and river runoff	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Previous work during a major sediment resuspension event (March 1988) in southern Lake Michigan demonstrated that nutrients and carbon derived from resuspended sediment stimulated intense winter heterotrophic production while simultaneously decreasing light availability and autotrophic biomass. However, the role of riverine inputs on plankton metabolism remained unclear. Here we present results from a simulated enrichment experiment (March 2000) designed to examine the influence of resuspended sediments and riverine inputs on Lake Michigan plankton dynamics. Lake water amended with realistic levels of river water, coastal resuspended sediment and river water + sediment till showed enhanced heterotrophic bacterial production and plankton respiration rates, relative to the lake water control. Bacterial production increased by approximately 4x in river water treatments and by a factor of 2.5x for the sediment only treatment compared to lake water controls. Rates of net primary production were stimulated by river water (8.5x) and resuspended sediment (3x), but most by a combination of river water + sediments (11X). Community respiration showed a similar response with rates approximately 8x higher in river water amendment treatments and 3.5x higher in the sediment treatment. Extrapolating experimentally determined production rates to the southern Lake Michigan basin indicated that heterotrophic and autotrophic production in this nearshore region may be enhanced by as much as 3x and 5.2x due to these source inputs. Indeed, field measurements throughout southern Lake Michigan from 1998-2000 support these experimental results. Experimental and field observations suggest that both seasonal riverine inputs and episodic resuspended sediments influence the regional scale ecosystem metabolism and biogeochemistry in Lake Michigan.

Isotopic and hydrologic responses of small, closed lakes to climate variability: Hydroclimate reconstructions from lake sediment oxygen isotope records and mass balance models	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Hydroclimate sensitivity simulations were conducted with a lake-catchment hydrologic and isotope mass balance model adapted to two small, closed lakes (Castor and Scanlon) located in the Pacific Northwest. Model simulations were designed to investigate the combined influences of persistent disequilibrium, reddening, and equifinality on lake water and sediment (i.e., biogenic and endogenic carbonate mineral) oxygen isotope (delta O-18) values and to provide a basis for quantitative, probabilistic climate reconstructions using lake sediment delta O-18 records. Simulation results indicate that within closed-basin lakes changes in long-term (i.e., multi-decadal) precipitation amounts produce inconsistent responses in lake water and sediment delta O-18 values that are strongly influenced by lake basin outseepage and morphometry. Simulations of variable initial conditions in which randomly generated monthly climate data (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) were used to force the model during the equilibration period (which precedes the application of instrumental climate data) demonstrate that Castor Lake and Scanlon Lake have a somewhat limited isotopic 'memory' of similar to 10 years. Additional tests conducted using a Monte Carlo ensemble (in which random climate data were used to force the model) combined with delta O-18 analyses of water samples collected from 2003 to 2011 AD, indicate that within small, closed lakes in the Pacific Northwest November-February precipitation is the strongest seasonal, climatic control on sediment oxygen-isotope values. Further, a Monte Carlo based reconstruction of 20 year average November-February precipitation amounts strongly correlates (R-2 = 0.66) to instrumental values from the 20th century (with all observed values falling within modeled 95% prediction limits), indicating that probabilistic, quantitative paleoclimate interpretations of lake sediment delta O-18 records are attainable.

We investigated sex-and age-related hepatic concentrations of inorganic contaminants in common loons (n = 53) that died from botulism and were salvaged at a Great Lakes staging area (i.e., Long Point, Lake Erie) during November 2005. We also investigated if hepatic concentrations of inorganic contaminants influenced lipid, protein, and mineral in our sample of migrant common loons. Last, we determined if there was correlation between Hg and selenium (Se). Consistent with data from breeding grounds, mean concentrations of Hg in liver were approximately 2.5 times greater in adult ((x) over bar = 14.64 +/- 16.69 mu g g(-1)) compared with juvenile birds ((x) over bar = 3.99 +/- 2.27 mu g g(-1)). Elements detected in liver at potentially harmful levels were Hg and Se, of which lipid reserves varied negatively with Hg concentrations but positively with Se concentrations. In addition, Hg and Se were correlated (r = 0.65) at greater then a demethylation threshold (total Hg C 8.5 mu g g(-1) dw) but not lower than that. Concentrations of inorganic contaminants did not influence protein and mineral levels in our sample of common loons. Our results suggest that Hg accumulation negatively affects lipid levels in migrant common loons. Results are also consistent with a nontoxic Hg-Se protein complex protecting loons migrating through areas that are relatively Se rich. Although the acquisition of Se during the nonbreeding season may decrease the toxicity of Hg, future research should consider the synergistic Hg-Se effect on reproduction in common loons that migrate through Se-rich locales, such as the Great Lakes.					chen, yuwei/U-9491-2017; Schummer, Michael/FDB-4240-2022; Belzile, Nelson/J-4607-2019														0090-4341	1432-0703				MAY	2012	62	4					704	713		10.1007/s00244-011-9724-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9724-5								22042040					WOS:000302809500015

Macrozoobenthos of Subarctic Lakes as an Indicator of Climate Change	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Changes in the macrozoobenthos of two northern lakes differing in degree of humification of water over the 50-year period that have passed since the first studies were considered. In the lake with water uncolored by humus, the benthos biomass increased, and in the humified one, it decreased. The changes that have occurred are due to climate warming, especially pronounced in winter. It was concluded that even closely located bodies of water can respond differently to climate change. Depending on the nature of the catchment area and the morphology of the lakes, either an increase in their productivity due to the supply of nutrients or a decrease due to humification can be observed.

Thane			Cell sorting analysis of geographically separated hypersaline environments	EXTREMOPHILES												Biogeography of microbial populations remains to be poorly understood, and a novel technique of single cell sorting promises a new level of resolution for microbial diversity studies. Using single cell sorting, we compared saturated NaCl brine environments (32-35 %) of the South Bay Salt Works in Chula Vista in California (USA) and Santa Pola saltern near Alicante (Spain). Although some overlap in community composition was detected, both samples were significantly different and included previously undiscovered 16S rRNA sequences. The community from Chula Vista saltern had a large bacterial fraction, which consisted of diverse Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. In contrast, Archaea dominated Santa Pola's community and its bacterial fraction consisted of the previously known Salinibacter lineages. The recently reported group of halophilic Archaea, Nanohaloarchaea, was detected at both sites. We demonstrate that cell sorting is a useful technique for analysis of halophilic microbial communities, and is capable of identifying yet unknown or divergent lineages. Furthermore, we argue that observed differences in community composition reflect restricted dispersal between sites, a likely mechanism for diversification of halophilic microorganisms.					; Mohan, Nikhil/Y-2077-2019; Zhaxybayeva, Olga/A-9665-2009	Papke, Robertson/0000-0003-1371-2341; Zhaxybayeva, Olga/0000-0002-1809-3909; Ram Mohan, Nikhil/0000-0002-7761-2772; Stepanauskas, Ramunas/0000-0003-4458-3108													1431-0651	1433-4909				MAR	2013	17	2					265	275		10.1007/s00792-013-0514-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-013-0514-z								23358730					WOS:000315574600007

Operating water quality monitoring networks is a challenge from both the scientific and economic points of view, especially in the case of river sections ranging over hundreds of kilometers. Therefore, spatiotemporal optimization is vital. In the present study, the optimization of the monitoring system of the River Tisza, the second largest river in Central Europe, is presented using a generally applicable and novel method, combined cluster and discriminant analysis (CCDA). This area for the study was chosen because, spatial inhomogeneity of a river's monitoring network can more easily be studied in a mostly natural watershed - as in the case of the River Tisza - since the effects of man-made obstacles: e.g water barrage systems, hydroelectric power plants, artificial lakes, etc. are more pronounced. Furthermore, since the temporal sampling frequency was bi-weekly, the opportunity of optimizing the monitoring system on a temporal (monthly) scale arose. In the research, 15 water quality parameters measured at 14 sampling sites in the Hungarian section of the River Tisza were assessed for the time period 1975-2005. First, four within-year sections ("hydrochemical seasons") were determined, characterized with unequal lengths, namely 2, 4, 2, and 4 months long starting with spring. Homogeneous groups of sampling sites were determined in space for every season, with the main separating factors being the tributaries and man-made obstacles. Similarly, an overall pattern of homogeneity was determined. As an overall result, the 14 sampling sites could be grouped into 11 homogeneous groups leading to the possibility of reducing the number of sampling locations and thus making the monitoring system more cost-efficient.

Diurnal studies of carbohydrate content, which is closely correlated with the rate of dark respiration, showed a consistent diurnal fluctuation in carbohydrate levels at depths of 2.5 m or less, with maximum values occurring in the late afternoon and minimum values in the early morning. The radiation maximum preceded the carbohydrate maximum by some hours. A seasonal study of carbohydrate content at 3 depths suggested that there were frequent biochemical gradients in the apparently homogeneous lake and that there might be nutrient limitation during the summer months. Laboratory experiments showed that N limitation caused the accumulation of carbohydrate in cells, but that this carbohydrate might be utilized if nitrate was added in the dark. Natural phytoplankton samples incubated in continuous light in the laboratory accumulated carbohydrate initially, but attained a plateau value after some hours. Calculations of the amount of carbohydrate accumulating in field populations of phytoplankton showed that at 0.5 m depth it represented a high proportion of the total C fixed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1978	66	1					97	115		10.2307/2259183	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259183													WOS:A1978EY13100006

The species include Alburnus alburnus, Blicca bjorkna, Carassius carassius, Chondrostoma nasus, Coregonus lavaretus, C. pidschain, Esox lucius, Leuciscus cephalus, L. leuciscus, Perca fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus, Salmo sp., Stizostedion lucioperca and Tinca tinca. In the mesotrophic Upper Lake Constance 8 summer-pelagic species apparently grow faster now than during earlier oligotrophic lake status. Trends of growth, feeding and yield in Upper Lake Constance produced 4 fish groups suggesting that planktivores were favored by eutrophication. In the more shallow eutrophic Lower Lake Constance only coregonids have grown slower than in the mesotrophic Upper Lake. Factors causing growth differences are probably food density and water temperature.																			0036-7842						1978	40	1					32	39		10.1007/BF02502370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02502370													WOS:A1978GA11300002

The spatial variability of snow and snow-derived white ice exerted a substantial influence on the quantity of light reaching the unfrozen water beneath the cover. An empirical model, based on a large in situ sample, demonstrates that the transmission of light relative to surface irradiance varies from < 0.02% in marginal and downwind areas to 4.50% in the central areas of the lake. The spatial distribution of light transmission is inversely related to the spatial distribution of depths of snow and/or white ice. Comparison of light reaching the unfrozen water surface based on both a single sample point and an areal estimate, suggests that the conventional single sample approach overestimates the quantity of light by more than 700%.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful multivariate statistical technique commonly used to assess environmental contamination. Ergene River Basin is the most important aquatic habitat of Thrace Region and is located in the north-western part of the Marmara Region of Turkey. The basin is intensively exposed to agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the macro and micro element accumulations (Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl, Pb) in water of the lotic (lakes) and lentic (reservoirs) components of the Ergene River Basin by using Pearson Correlation Index (PCI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this purpose, water samples were collected in the spring season of 2018 from a total of 36 stations selected on the basin and some micro and macro element accumulations were determined. According to the results of PCI, significant relationships were found between the investigated macro and microelements in p<0.05 and p<0.01 significance levels. According to the PCA results, four factors explained 87% of the total variance in terms of total percentage variances after rotation.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													1302-7050	2146-5894					2020	17	2					137	148		10.33462/jotaf.561653	http://dx.doi.org/10.33462/jotaf.561653													WOS:000566801800003

We collected 65 samples covering different regions of the two lakes over four seasons to unveil spatial and temporal patterns of PPEs community composition. The use of flow cytometry sorting largely improved the efficiency of detecting PPEs sequences and over 70% of the retrieved reads belonged to PPEs. Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta dominated PPEs in most of the samples. A distinct but complex seasonality of PPEs composition emerged at the OTUs level. NGS-based Miseq sequencing facilitates an in-depth view of numerous rare OTUs. Nearly 80% of the PPEs OTUs were rare and lots of them were detected only in one season, whereas most of the abundant OTUs were frequently detected in all seasons but only changed in relative abundances. Besides, a close relative of the marine PPEs species Ostreococcus sp. (OTU_ 1144, 99% identity) was discovered in freshwater systems for the first time and was abundant especially in winter. The diversity and community composition of PPEs were more dependent on season rather than sampling sites. Temperature, phycocyanin and NO(3)AN concentrations in Lake Taihu explained the PPE composition variations, whereas in Lake Chaohu TN/TP ratios, temperature, pH and nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) seemed to be the most important factors. In addition, a great number of OTUs belong to nonpigmented picoeukaryotes, especially Chytridiomycota, Perkinsozoa, Ciliophora and Cercozoa, which are known to include algae parasites as well as predators. The results of mantel test also showed that the community of photosynthetic and nonpigmented picoeukaryotes were significantly correlated in both lakes.					; Li, Shengnan/AAR-4992-2020	Bronner, Gisele/0000-0002-4863-4518; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2017	19	6			SI		2286	2300		10.1111/1462-2920.13724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13724								28276185					WOS:000404007700017

E.; Takacs-Vesbach, Cristina			Spatial and temporal patterns of snow accumulation and aerial ablation across the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Snow in the McMurdo Dry Valleys is a potential source of moisture for subnivian soils in a cold desert ecosystem. In a water-limited environment, enhanced soil moisture is expected to provide more favourable conditions for subnivian soil communities. In addition, snow cover insulates the underlying soil from air temperature extremes. Quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal snow accumulation and ablation is necessary to understand these dynamics. Repeat high-resolution imagery acquired for the 2009-2010 austral summer was used to map the seasonal distribution of snow across Taylor and Wright valleys, Southern Victorialand, Antarctica. An edge detection algorithm was used to perform an object-based classification of snow-covered area. Coupled with topographic parameters obtained from a 30-m digital elevation model, unique distribution patterns were characterized for five regions within the neighbouring valleys. Time lapses of snow distribution in each region provide insight into spatially variable aerial ablation rates (change in area of landscape covered by snow) across the region. A strong coastal to interior gradient of decreasing snow-covered area was evident for both Taylor and Wright valleys. The surrounding regions of Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, Lake Bonney, Lake Brownworth, and Lake Vanda exhibited losses of snow-covered area of 9.61km(2) (-93%), 1.63km(2) (-72%), 1.07km(2) (-97%), 2.60km(2) (-82%), and 0.25km(2) (-96%), respectively, as measured from peak accumulation in October to mid-January. Differences in aerial ablation rates within and across local regions suggest that both topographic variation and regional microclimates influence the ablation of seasonal snow cover.

We conducted mist-netting and passive surveys in a variety of habitats on the island from January-March 2012 and December 2012-March 2013. We captured four warblers and sighted at least six other individuals, including two color-banded birds originally banded near Mack Lake, Michigan, USA. Warblers were primarily captured or observed in coastal scrub and inland low coppice habitats where vegetation height is <4 m, has a scrub/shrub appearance, and openings because of disturbance. These habitats are similar to habitats preferred by Kirtland's Warblers on other Bahamian islands, and also have fruiting plants the warblers prefer such as Erithalis fruticosa, and Lantana involucrata. To our knowledge, these are the first confirmed cases of observed Kirtland's Warblers on the island in over 46 years.					; Jones, Todd/KGK-8630-2024	Akresh, Michael/0000-0002-8577-2063; 													1559-4491	1938-5447				SEP	2013	125	3					637	642		10.1676/13-007.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/13-007.1													WOS:000324718700021

Growth rates of rainbow smelt in Lake Champlain: effects of density and diet	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We estimated the densities of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) using hydroacoustics and obtained specimens for diet analysis and groundtruthed acoustics data from mid-water trawl sampling in four areas of Lake Champlain, USA-Canada. Densities of rainbow smelt cohorts alternated during the 2-year study; age-0 rainbow smelt were very abundant in 2001 (up to 6 fish per m(2)) and age-1 and older were abundant (up to 1.2 fish per m(2)) in 2002. Growth rates and densities varied among areas and years. We used model selection on eight area-year-specific variables to investigate biologically plausible predictors of rainbow smelt growth rates. The best supported model of growth rates of age-0 smelt indicated a negative relationship with age-0 density, likely associated with intraspecific competition for zooplankton. The next best-fit model had age-1 density as a predictor of age-0 growth. The best supported models (N = 4) of growth rates of age-1 fish indicated a positive relationship with availability of age-0 smelt and resulting levels of cannibalism. Other plausible models were contained variants of these parameters. Cannibalistic rainbow smelt consumed younger conspecifics that were up to 53% of their length. Prediction of population dynamics for rainbow smelt requires an understanding of the relationship between density and growth as age-0 fish outgrow their main predators (adult smelt) by autumn in years with fast growth rates, but not in years with slow growth rates.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2011	20	4					503	512		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00472.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2010.00472.x													WOS:000296448500002

The Lauca Basin (northern Chilean Altiplano) contains variably fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary sequences spanning the interval from 8.7 to 2.3 Ma. Field samples were collected from paleo-lacustrine sediments in the basin. Sediments were dated using detrital zircon geochronology on volcanic tuffs, yielding an age range between similar to 5.57 and 5.44 Ma. These new age constraints provided an opportunity to evaluate changes in the Lauca Basin ecosystem across this dynamic Miocene-Pliocene transition. We employed multiple proxies (lithofacies analysis, diatoms, pollen, and oxygen stable isotopes of authigenic carbonates) to interpret ancient lacustrine and terrestrial paleoenvironments. Alternations among mudstone, carbonate, and evaporitic facies indicate lake-level variability through time. The diatom assemblage is characterized by meso- to hypersaline and alkaline-tolerant taxa typical of shallow lakes. The delta O-18 values ranged from -8.96 to -2.22 parts per thousand indicating fluctuations in water balance. Pollen taxa in the outcrop are typical of a transitional stage between seasonal cloud forest and open grassland. Together, these proxies indicate that the Lauca paleolake sediments were deposited under a wetter-than-modem climate with high temporal variability. Our results refine previous studies in the Lauca Basin and are consistent with other regional studies suggesting that the South American summer monsoon at the Miocene-Pliocene transition was more intense than it is at present.

However, the trade-offs among the adaptation mechanisms used by submersed macrophytes to low-light stress remain unclear. Moreover, the experimental period used in most previous studies was relatively short, and plant traits were not monitored multiple throughout the experimental period. In the present study, we examined the growth of a representative submersed macrophyte, Potamogeton maackianus, under four light regimes (2.8%, 7.1%, 17.1% and 39.5% of ambient light) over a course of 12 months and assessed various plant traits at monthly and quarterly intervals. The results showed that P. maackianus exhibited a lower leaf moisture content and a higher stem moisture content under decreased light conditions. Under the lowest light regime, P. maackianus had low soluble carbohydrate (SC) contents in the leaves and low starch contents in the stems at all the seasons. P. maackianus showed different allometric relationships among different treatments reflected different adaption strategies resulting from different light environment. P. maackianus exhibited a relatively stable biomass allocation pattern characterized by a continual increase in the stem mass fraction of total biomass under relatively high light transmittance (17.1% and 39.5%), which is a response of P. maackianus that can ensure a high initial biomass in the next spring season. However, under low light transmittance, the biomass allocation pattern fluctuated early in the experiment, and the amplitude increased with decreases in the light transmittance (2.8% and 7.1%). P. maackianus exhibited trade-offs between the stem (plant height) and leaf mass (leaf area) fractions of the total biomass, which help improve the adaptation of the macrophyte to a low-light environment. Our results can be useful for estimating light-use conditions of P. maackianus according to regression relationships between the leaf/stem mass fractions of the total biomass and time.

GEOGRAPHICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WATER QUALITY OF BOVAN LAKE, SERBIA	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In this work we performed a complex geographical analysis of the Bovan Lake basin, Serbia, as well as an analysis of the physical, chemical and biological parameters of water reservoir during a one-year period. The basic sanitary characteristics and physical, chemical and biological parameters, necessary for understanding locality conditions, were studied, and the saprobity index, class of quality, index O/H, degree of saprobity, degree of trophicity and category based on the phosphatase activity index (PAI), were determined. Our results classify the ecosystem as polytrophic. The degree of saprobity is oligosaprobic - beta mesosaprobic, with a catarobic degree in winter, classifying the water as III - IV class of quality. Due to the presence of organic residues, a domination of heterotrophic bacteria in comparison to oligotrophic bacteria is evident. The ability of autopurification is weak. The results indicate the need for continual monitoring of the water quality and environmental protection of Bovan Lake.					; Zlatkovic, Slobodan/Y-9549-2018; Stanković, Slaviša/S-6273-2018; Zlatković, Slobodan/Y-9549-2018; Stankovic, Slavisa/S-6273-2018	Knezevic-Vukcevic, Jelena/0000-0002-8138-6579; Zlatkovic, Slobodan/0000-0003-0464-8202; Stankovic, Slavisa/0000-0003-0527-8741; Milincic, Miroljub/0009-0004-0003-9957													0354-4664						2010	62	4					1083	1089		10.2298/ABS1004083Z	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS1004083Z													WOS:000287217500026
J	Biro, PA; Post, JR; Parkinson, EA				Biro, PA; Post, JR; Parkinson, EA			Population consequences of a predator-induced habitat shift by trout in whole-lake experiments	ECOLOGY												In a replicated whole-lake experiment, we (a) tested for the existence of a flexible habitat shift in response to predator presence in age-0 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at risk of cannibalism and (b) evaluated the population-level consequences of habitat shifts in terms of growth and survival over their first growing season. Daphnid food and adult trout predators were substantially more abundant in pelagic than in littoral habitats. Age-0 trout used all habitats in populations without adult trout predators, whereas age-0 trout were observed only in the less profitable littoral habitat in populations with adult trout. Consequently, mean fall mass of age-0 trout in the presence of predators was almost half that observed in populations without adult trout. Despite the shift in habitat use, age-0 trout experienced 90% mortality when adult trout predators were present, in comparison to only 36% mortality when absent. We conclude that the commonly observed habitat shifts by fish at risk of predation, observed at smaller scales, do in fact occur at the whole-system scale over long time intervals. These results suggest that fish are able to perceive risk at large spatial scales and thus take advantage of profitable (but normally risky) habitats when predators are absent, or move to less profitable refuge habitats when predators are present.

Small tundra takes and ponds located within the system of raised marine terraces on the eastern coast of Petuniabukta (the northern tip of Billefjorden in Central Spitsbergen) were investigated for hydrological, hydrochemical and sedimentological purposes in summer seasons 2001-2003 and 2006. Despite small extent of the area of investigations, lake waters are characterised by high variability of specific electrical conductivity (376-1201 mu S/cm) and concentration of cations and anions. Principal components analysis indicate, that chemical composition is under constant influence of crustal components reflecting geological setting (carbonate rocks, anhydrite and gypsum outcrops) and marine components, which amount depends on the distance from the coast and the exposure to marine aerosols. Tundra wetlands play an important role as the local geostorage of mineral matter delivered by aeolian and niveo-aeolian processes and solutes supplied by precipitation and marine aerosols, the seasonal activity of permafrost active layer, and the production of biomass in tundra ecosystem. Today, the area of lakes is in the stage of significant decrease and is replaced by freshwater marshes. Results from the limnologic investigation of the lakes enrich data from arid polar climate tundra zone on Spitsbergen where lake monitoring up to now has been rare.

C for 30 days and allowed to feed ad lib on white suckers (Catostomus commersoni). Increases in water temperature and in lamprey size caused the rate of host mortality to increase in agreement with observations that mortality in the Great Lakes is seasonal. Instantaneous growth rates were maximal at 20.degree. C for lampreys of 10-30 g, the optimal temperature for growth shifting to 15.degree. C for larger lampreys of 30-90 g. Growth rates were intermediate at 10.degree. C and lowest at 4.degree. C for lampreys of all size. Host mortality increased with temperature over the 4-20.degree. C range. At all experimental temperatures, increases in lamprey weight were accompanied by an exponential decline in instantaneous growth rates, a phenomenon also observed for teleosts. Laboratory growth rates at temperatures of 5-15.degree. C were comparable to rates observed for lampreys in Lake Huron between April and Nov. and agree with the observation that lampreys feed in deeper waters between April and June before moving to warmer, shallower waters during the summer when growth rate increases.																									1977	34	9					1373	1378		10.1139/f77-197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-197													WOS:A1977DS97700009

Landscape-scale evaluation of pesticide pollution and ecological risks in a protected mediterranean wetland	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Conventional prospective Environmental Risk Assessments (ERAs) often fail to account for the complex spatialtemporal dynamics of pesticide transport and exposure, limiting their ecological relevance. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit modelling approach to assess pesticide exposure and risks in the Albufera Natural Park (ANP), a protected Mediterranean coastal wetland heavily influenced by intensive rice cultivation. The model chain integrates hydrological simulations (erahumed), pesticide dynamics in rice paddies (RiceWQ), and hydrodynamic transport (Delft3D), allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of pesticide emissions from rice paddies to drainage channels, and to the Albufera Lake. Surface water concentrations were calculated for 8 pesticides applied to three rice varieties over a period of 10 years. Ecotoxicological risks were calculated for single compounds and for pesticide mixtures using acute and chronic Species Sensitivity Distributions. The model accurately reproduced hydrological dynamics and pesticide concentrations, with the fungicide Azoxystrobin showing the best agreement with monitoring data. Through mass balance analysis, we quantified substantial pesticide inputs into the ANP and showed that their dispersion and degradation were driven by application timing, hydrological flows, and pesticide specific properties. Acute pesticide risks were identified in the rice fields, with individual pesticide PAFs (Potentially Affected Fraction) reaching up to 12 % of species for Azoxystrobin, and mixture pesticide PAFs exceeding 22 %. In the Albufera lake, the maximum acute risk reached 7 %. Chronic risks calculated based on 21-day time weighted average concentrations were driven by Azoxystrobin and Difenoconazole in late summer, with additional contributions from Penoxsulam and MCPA in early summer. Mixtures of up to five substances exceeding the chronic 5 % PAF were identified, resulting in potential risks for 40 % of species in the Albufera Lake. This study highlights the importance of considering full pesticide application schemes and landscape-scale models for assessing pesticide risks to non-target aquatic organisms in protected aquatic ecosystems.

A two-year, high-frequency meteorological and water-column dataset from the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, in Mexico, at an altitude of about 4200 m above sea level, allowed for the study of temporal changes in the thermal structure, water level, and water balance in the Lakes El Sol and La Luna, separated by about 500 m by a lava dome. Annual fluctuations in the water level of the lakes and calculations of the annual variability of the water balance showed that the lakes accumulated almost four times less water from rainfall than expected. Furthermore, the temperature measured at a depth of 15 cm in the bottom sediments of Lake El Sol revealed an unexpected warming during the cold season. Estimated heat fluxes through the lake bottom were less than 0.3 W m(-2) during the winter and less than 0.1 W m(-2) during the rest of the year. Although the variability of the hydrometeorological regime of high-mountain lakes remains relatively poorly understood, our results significantly improve the understanding of these complex processes of stratification and mixing in these unique lake ecosystems.					, Lyd/GPT-4924-2022; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Tereshchenko, Iryna/A-4244-2011; Barba-López, María del Refugio/GPP-1404-2022	Filonov, Anatoliy/0000-0001-7355-191X; Pantoja-Gonzalez, Diego Armando/0000-0002-7521-6274; Ladah, Lydia/0000-0003-4009-4817; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Tereshchenko, Iryna/0000-0002-3643-2898; Barba Lopez, Maria del Refugio/0000-0003-2627-757X; 														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	7							1104	10.3390/w14071104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14071104													WOS:000781874100001

Cassini RADAR Team	Transient surface liquid in Titan's polar regions from Cassini	ICARUS												Cassini RADAR images of Titan's south polar region acquired during southern summer contain lake features which disappear between observations. These features show a tenfold increases in backscatter cross-section between images acquired one year apart, which is inconsistent with common scattering models without invoking temporal variability. The morphologic boundaries are transient, further supporting changes in lake level. These observations are consistent with the exposure of diffusely scattering lakebeds that were previously hidden by an attenuating liquid medium. We use a two-layer model to explain backscatter variations and estimate a drop in liquid depth of approximately 1-m-per-year. On larger scales, we observe shoreline recession between ISS and RADAR images of Ontario Lacus, the largest lake in Titan's south polar region. The recession, occurring between June 2005 and July 2009, is inversely proportional to slopes estimated from altimetric profiles and the exponential decay of near-shore backscatter, consistent with a uniform reduction of 4 +/- 1.3 m in lake depth. Of the potential explanations for observed surface changes, we favor evaporation and infiltration. The disappearance of dark features and the recession of Ontario's shoreline represents volatile transport in an active methane-based hydrologic cycle. Observed loss rates are compared and shown to be consistent with available global circulation models. To date, no unambiguous changes in lake level have been observed between repeat images in the north polar region, although further investigation is warranted. These observations constrain volatile flux rates in Titan's hydrologic system and demonstrate that the surface plays an active role in its evolution. Constraining these seasonal changes represents the first step toward our understanding of longer climate cycles that may determine liquid distribution on Titan over orbital time periods.

Molecular Rotors and Motors: Recent Advances and Future Challenges	ACS NANO												At the "Molecular Rotors and Motors" symposium of the Spring 2009 ACS National Meeting in Salt Lake City (March 22-26), a diverse mix of talks addressed many current issues in the field. Speakers described topics that varied from single-molecule rotors and nanomachines to exquisite synthetic approaches toward building functional materials and mathematical and computational methods aimed at uncovering design opportunities and highlighting the fundamental limitations of molecular motors. While the realization of building useful nanomachines remains far off, a general consensus abounded that investigating biological systems and understanding the implications of the laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics for the behavior of nanostructures will help drive important advances in the quest for molecular machinery. Molecular rotors were demonstrated to have practical applications as probes for microviscosity, and many speakers presented experimental studies that indicated that highly directed translation and rotation of individual molecules, as well as interacting dipolar arrays, are just around the corner. While this Nano Focus is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the subject, it will focus on several key advances that were presented at the ACS meeting and highlight future challenges for the field of molecular rotors and motors.

J	Panov, VE; McQueen, DJ				Panov, VE; McQueen, DJ			Effects of temperature on individual growth rate and body size of a freshwater amphipod	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Individual growth rates of the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure) were measured in the littoral zone of two small oligotrophic Ontario lakes and in growth experiments over a natural temperature gradient (10, 15, 20, and 23 degrees C). Field observations showed that a temperature of 20 degrees C is important for both the induction and termination of reproductive resting stages in H. azteca. Growth rates were more affected by temperature in small than in large individuals. Growth parameters are related to rearing temperature by linear regressions, which can be used as a simple model for bioenergetics calculations in crustaceans. A negative relationship between water temperature and maximum size attained by the amphipods was found. The largest adults were absent in studied populations when summer temperatures were high, and this phenomenon, which has also been observed in other aquatic invertebrates, was bioenergetically determined. Energy-budget estimations showed negative net growth efficiency (K-2) in the largest adults at temperatures above 20 degrees C. The relationship between K-2 and temperature showed a dome-shaped pattern, K-2 values for larger amphipods being maximal at lower temperatures. Seasonal migrations of adult H. azteca from shallow littoral to deeper cold habitats, observed in lakes during the warmest periods, appear to be temperature-induced and bioenergetically advantageous, despite probable increases in predation risk experienced in spatially simple deep-water habitats.					; Panov, Vadim/E-3927-2016	Panov, Vadim/0009-0003-0738-0800; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				JUN	1998	76	6					1107	1116		10.1139/cjz-76-6-1107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-76-6-1107													WOS:000077327300013

The basic inputs to the model are air temperature and snow depth as recorded at the U.S. National Weather Service station, Barrow Alaska. The simulated long-term mean maximum ice thickness was 1.91 +/- 0.21 m with a range from 1.33 m (1962) to 2.47 m (1976). Variations in the seasonal snow cover played a much greater role than air temperatures in controlling ice-thickness variability during the 50 year simulation period. The sensitivity of lake-ice growth to extremes of snow depth, air temperature and snow bulk thermal conductivity is investigated. This study shows that lake-ice thickness has varied significantly from year to year in northern Alaska. Continued variability combined with potential climate change could affect the area of ice that freezes completely to the bottom of lakes each winter, resulting in changes in water storage and availability, permafrost thermal regime and talik dynamics beneath lakes, and methane efflux and energy fluxes to the atmosphere. It is concluded that quantification and a full understanding of these potential effects will require systematic and continuous field measurements that will provide better forcing and validation fields for improved models.					; ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020	ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501; 													0260-3055		0-946417-26-1				2000	31						339	347		10.3189/172756400781819905	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756400781819905													WOS:000166916600054

It occurred in the Western sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campanian Region, South Italy) at the intersection of two active fault systems, oriented NE and NW. The morphologically complex crater area, largely filled by the Averno lake, resulted from vent activation and migration along the NE-trending fault system. The eruption generated a complex sequence of pyroclastic deposits, including pumice fall deposits in the lower portion, and prevailing surge beds in the intermediate-upper portion. The pyroclastic sequence has been studied through stratigraphical, morphostructural and petrological investigations, and subdivided into three members named A through C. Member A was emplaced during the first phase of the eruption mainly by magmatic explosions which generated columns reaching a maximum height of 10 km. During this phase the eruption reached its climax with a mass discharge rate of 3.2 10(6) kg/s. Intense fracturing and fault activation favored entry of a significant amount of water into the system, which produced explosions driven by variably efficient water-magma interaction. These explosions generated wet to dry surge deposits that emplaced Member B and C, respectively. Isopachs and isopleths maps, as well as areal distribution of ballistic fragments and facies variation of surge deposits allow definition of four vents that opened along a NE oriented, 2 km long fissure. The total volume of magma extruded during the eruption has been estimated at about 0.07 km(3) (DRE). The erupted products range in composition from initial, weakly peralkaline alkali-trachyte, to last-emplaced alkali-trachyte. Isotopic data and modeling suggest that mixing occurred during the Averno 2 eruption between a more evolved, less radiogenic stored magma, and a less evolved, more radiogenic magma that entered the shallow reservoir to trigger the eruption. The early phases of the eruption, during which the vent migrated from SW to the center of the present lake, were fed by the more evolved, uppermost magma, while the following phases extruded the less evolved, lowermost magma. Integration of the geological and petrological results suggests that the Averno 2 complex eruption was fed from a dyke-shaped shallow reservoir intruded into the NE-SW fault system bordering to the west the La Starza resurgent block, within the caldera floor.

Two main types of fodder could be detected, which were both consumed in winter. The more frequent type is characterized by remains of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus s. 1.) probably showing the use of pasture in the near surroundings of the settlement. The second type is dominated by leaf fragments of silver fir (Abies alba) and by pollen and anthers of early-flowering shrubs such as hazel (Corylus avellana) and alder (Alnus sp.), pointing in the latter cases to additional foddering of twigs to livestock inside the settlement in times of shortage.

The cores, separated by ca. 57 km, were analyzed for fossil pollen, charcoal and loss-on-ignition. The Maxus 4 core encompasses the last 9500 years, while the Maxus I core provides a record for approximately the last 2000 years, As neither core registered evidence of human impacts or land use, an unobscured image of Holocene vegetation and climate change was obtained, Alternating wet and drier periods on a millennial scale characterized much of the Holocene. The unusually high values of Cecropia in the pollen sum between 8700 and 5800 cal yr BP suggest frequent disturbance or the presence of early successional habitat. After 5800 cal yr BP a series of taxa rising and falling in prominence reveals a hydrarch succession that culminated in a relatively dry period between ca. 4900 and 3700 cal yr BP. Seasonal flooding of the site is evident as local water tables rose between 3700 and ca. 1000 cal yr BP. After 1000 cal yr BP the modem wooded wetland was established. The second site Maxus 1 reveals a detailed history of approximately last 2000 years. The principal feature of the record is a disturbance event at about 1000 cal yr BP, followed by a period of hydrarch succession. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Location Lakes and rivers of Patagonia. Methods We compared, and eventually reconsidered, general data about distribution based on the original literature about capture sites, incorporating several published and unpublished data to the analysis of the biological traits and distribution of Galaxiidae. Results The more consistent issue in the comprehension of galaxiid biogeography in South America is the ability to establish landlocked populations. Different founding events in landlocked populations of Galaxias maculatus suggest the possible existence of older and younger landlocked populations. This difference in the time since the establishment of lacustrine populations could have been expressed in their ability for colonization of post-glacial areas. Galaxias maculatus, Aplochiton and Brachygalaxias are more clearly excluded from the post-glacial area than G. platei. For all the species we could note a more abundant record of lake populations at the area of glacial refuges. It could be noted that the most successful species, Galaxias platei, is a specialized deep bottom dweller. Deep bottom dwelling helps to endure winter constraints and it appears to be an alternative to the colonization of the littoral and limnetic zones of post-glacial lakes, the prefered habitat of the other Patagonian fish species. Main conclusions At the end of this process of post-glacial colonization, in the beginning of twentieth century, man introduced several salmonid species in Patagonia. In addition, antropogenic actions had its more recent consequences in global warming. Nowadays we were able to observe new localities for Brazilian fishes into the Austral Subregion and expect some changes in the distribution of Galaxiidae. Northern limits for all species and southern limits for landlocked G. maculatus, Brachigalaxias bullocki and Aplochiton zebra, could be displaced southward. Probably, the species less affected by the changes will be G. platei. These predictions could be accurately formulated using the model of B.J. Shuter & J.R. Post (1990) Transactions of the American Fisheries Society119, 314-336, when biological database on these species are completed.

J	DUPONT, J				DUPONT, J			QUEBEC LAKE SURVEY .1. STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT OF SURFACE-WATER QUALITY	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The Quebec Lake Survey (QLS) was conducted as part of the Quebec Spatial Lake Acidity monitoring network (RESSALQ). A total of 1253 lakes were visited at winter-time between 1986 and 1990, to quantify and to extrapolate the water quality status of a statistically representative set of lakes to the target lake population of five subregions. Water quality is strongly influenced by terrain characteristics. The airborne anthropogenic pollution also influences greatly the water chemistry of lakes in areas receiving high SO4 depositions. Within the QLS study area, the Cote-Nord subregion is the most sensitive and the most affected by acidity. Yet, these acidic conditions can be mostly explained by the combination of an important organic acid contribution and the extreme sensitivity of the area. The Outaouais and Abitibi areas also present great proportions of acidic lakes. The acidity of these lakes originates mostly from anthropogenic sources.																			0049-6979					JAN	1992	61	1-2					107	124		10.1007/BF00478369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478369													WOS:A1992HB33200008
J	Craddock, JP; Magloughlin, JF				Craddock, JP; Magloughlin, JF			Calcite strains, kinematic indicators, and magnetic flow fabric of a proterozoic pseudotachylyte swarm, Minnesota River valley, USA	TECTONOPHYSICS												Near Granite Falls, Minnesota sub-parallel pseudotachylyte, mafic dikes, and calcite veins crosscut Archean granulite tacies rocks in the Minnesota River valley adjacent to the north-dipping Yellow Medicine Shear Zone (YMSZ; N80 degrees E) that separates the Montevideo and Morton tectonic terranes. The docking of these two Archean terranes occurred prior to intrusion of the 2.067 Ga Kenora-Kabetogama dike swarm as demonstrated by aeromagnetic anomalies (correlated with field exposures) that cross the YMSZ without offset. Tectonic adjustments along the YMSZ associated with the Penokean Orogeny (similar to 1.8 Ga) are likely responsible for pseudotachylyte formation. Pseudotachylyte is exposed in 22 sub-parallel veins (similar to NSO degrees E, 90 degrees) each less than 2 cm wide across an outcrop width of 45 in. The pseudotachylyte matrix is commonly banded, and contains crystal fragments (quartz, plagioclase, amphibole, rutile, apatite, ilmenite, ulvospinel), magnetite microlites, flow banding swirls, amygdules (filled with calcite, ankerite and siderite), collapsed vesicles, and abundant lithic clasts. Pseudotachylyte formed in a number of phases. Kinematic reconstruction is complex, utilizing winged porphyroclasts, S-C structures in the country rock, and fault drag indicators along the pseudotachylyte zones. Dextral motion along the YMSZ is the most common observation. Mechanically twinned calcite within amygdules in the pseudotachylyte preserves horizontal shortening normal to the pseudotachylyte strike. Calcite veins are apparently contemporaneous with the pseudotachylyte; one set preserves twinning strains identical to the calcite amygdule strains, and the second set contains a horizontal, vein-parallel (N70 degrees E) shortening strain. The pseudotachylyte contains a flow fabric, as determined by AMS techniques, that is a proxy for vertical flow (K,,,, is vertical). The Kenora-Kabetogama dikes, identified geochemically, are locally parallel to the pseudotachylyte and the adjacent YMSZ tectonic suture and preserve a vertical-to-horizontal, dike-parallel AMS fabric from east (Franklin) to west (Granite Falls). Homblende andesite dikes (055 degrees, similar to 1.8 Ga) are not found south of the suture, are not associated with pseudotachylyte and have a different paleopole and AMS fabric.

Measurements of Pb-210 geochronology and sediment profiles of organic carbon, nitrogen, organic phosphorus, inorganic phosphorus, and biogenic silica (BSI) were used to develop temporal concentration trends. Recent sediments have 2-3 times as much organic carbon and nitrogen as sediments from 80 to 100 yr ago, but the increases result from both changes in organic matter deposition and time-dependent changes in organic matter decomposition rates, Despite increases in phosphorus loading, no major changes in phosphorus concentration were noted throughout most of the century; anthropogenic phosphorus deposition, though not evident in sulfidic mid-bay sediments, must occur in more oxidizing sediment environments in both the northern and southern bays. Temporal trends in BSi concentrations are much less evident and the lack of substantial increases in this century suggest that BSi inputs may be capped by late spring-sumner Si limitation.

J	Witt, JC; Webster, CR				Witt, Jill C.; Webster, Christopher R.			Regeneration dynamics in remnant Tsuga canadensis stands in the northern Lake States: Potential direct and indirect effects of herbivory	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We examined the effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory and microsite limitation on Tsuga canadensis regeneration in 39 randomly selected remnant T. canadensis stands in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Deer of the region migrate to and congregate in T. canadensis stands in winter resulting in strong seasonal habitat use patterns. In each study stand, we quantified vegetation, microsite availability, and deer use (via pellet counts). While some stands contained high densities of T. canadensis regeneration (stems < 4.0 cm dbh), we found complete T. canadensis regeneration failures in 6 out of 39 stands. Additionally, 17 and 22 stands respectively, had complete failures in the small and large sapling categories. General linear models suggested that deer use was the primary limiting factor in the small sapling size class, even at relatively low levels of deer use. T. canadensis seedling density was positively associated with the availability of high-decay coarse woody debris and negatively associated with basal area of Acer saccharum in the overstory. This latter association may be due, at least in part, to negative effects of broadleaf litter on T. canadensis establishment and a general trend toward increasing Acer abundance in the regeneration layer. Our results suggest that differential tolerance to browsing (Tsuga vs. Acer) in conjunction with reduced germination substrate availability may set up a scenario where successful T. canadensis establishments is more limited by legacy and indirect than direct effects given contemporary levels of deer use.

All Isoetes originally present below 0.6 m died, and only plants standing between 5.8 and 6.1 m (new depth) survived. As irradiance decreased, remaining individuals produced fewer leaves, but their biomass production was higher, as leaf length increased in response to the diminished available irradiance. Because leaf mortality was excessive, regeneration capacity, population performance and dynamics were adversely affected. In 1992, no new production occurred in Isoetes lacustris individuals surviving after the winter. We suggest that low surface oxygen levels at the water column under the ice, and total anoxia below 6 m depth, caused the demise of the I. lacustris population in Lake Baciver.

This study investigated several surface water quality parameters and their relationships with the water quality index (WQI) and trophic status index (TSI) of Shahu Lake from 2011 to 2018. A health risk assessment was conducted, and the correlations among water recharge, climatic conditions, and the aforementioned elements were determined. Results show that the water quality in this lake went from good to moderate and back to good as reflected in the changes in its WQI values from 2011 to 2018. The relative water quality inferiority of this lake in 2015 and 2016 was attributed to the significant increase in its CODMn, TP, TN, NH3-N, and fluoride (F-) concentrations during these years. A combination of these parameters could rapidly predict water quality through a stepwise multiple linear regression. During the study period (except in the frozen season), Shahu Lake maintained a eutrophic status every month (especially in July) irrespective of the spatial changes resulting from low secchi depth and high TP. The limiting nutrient of Shahu Lake changed from phosphorus to both nitrogen and phosphorus, especially during summer, due to seasonal variations and exogenous inputs. The lake had an acceptable health risk level, and water recharge both had positive and negative effects on this lake as reflected in the significant decrease or increase in the concentrations of its principal parameters. This condition was also attributed to temperature and precipitation, which resulted in significant TSI variations. The findings of this study provide ways of estimating and forecasting water quality and trophic status and a basis for managing and improving similar brackish-water lakes.

J	Liang, SL; Zhong, B; Fang, HL				Liang, Shunlin; Zhong, Bo; Fang, Hongliang			Improved estimation of aerosol optical depth from MODIS imagery over land surfaces	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimation of aerosol loadings is of great importance to the studies on global climate changes. The current Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol estimation algorithm over land is based on the "dark-object" approach, which works only over densely vegetated ("dark") surfaces. In this study, we develop a new aerosol estimation algorithm that uses the temporal signatures from a sequence of MODIS imagery over land surfaces, particularly "bright" surfaces. The estimated aerosol optical depth is validated by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. Case studies indicate that this algorithm can retrieve aerosol optical depths reasonably well from the winter MODIS imagery at seven sites: four sites in the greater Washington, DC area, USA; Beijing City, China; Banizoumbou, Niger, Africa; and Bratts Lake, Canada. The MODIS aerosol estimation algorithm over land (MOD04), however, does not perform well over these non-vegetated surfaces. This new algorithm has the potential to be used for other satellite images that have similar temporal resolutions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All rivers show high MIS3 and MIS2 Q(bf), declining in the Holocene. The Q(bf) of modern MDB rivers is correlated with total catchment precipitation but comparison with palaeochannel Q(bf) estimates shows that while enhanced runoff efficiency is necessary to account for much larger late Pleistocene palaeochannels, either lower or higher precipitation rates could have prevailed. A strong association between relative palaeo- Q(bf) enhancement and temperature suggests a temperature-mediated mechanism controlling river discharge, such as the fraction of precipitation stored as snow and thawing in spring, the enhancement of orographic rainfall, or CO2 feedbacks with vegetation cover. Significantly enhanced MIS3 Q(bf) requires an additional mechanism, such as increased rainfall. These findings are consistent with others that increased moisture availability was associated with past colder climates, although this was not necessarily the result of enhanced precipitation.

Phytoplankton were dominated by the euplankter dinoflagellate Peridiniopsis penardii. The major fatty acids were (in decreasing order of abundance), 16:1omega7, 16:0, 22:6omega3, 14:0, 20:5omega3, 24:1omega9, 16:4omega1 and 16:3omega4. The phytoplankton lipids contain relatively low proportions of some of the typically major fatty acids of dinoflagellates (e.g. 18:1omega9 and 18:4omega3). Furthermore, the phytoplankton lipids exhibited only trace amounts of 3,6,9,12,15-octadecapentaenoic acid. Octadecapentaenoic acid (18:5omega3) is a predominant and potentially toxic fatty acid characteristic of dinoflagellates. This fatty acid profile differed substantially from those reported for marine and cultivated dinoflagellate species.

This study aims to quantify how the recent changes affected to investigate the trend of land surface albedo in Iran between 2000 and 2018. Accessing field data from the Iran is difficult, and thus the common understanding of climate change in the region is strongly based on satellite data. We use remotely sensed data of land surface albedo, land surface temperature (LST), number of snow-covered days (SCDs), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land cover type, obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results show decreasing trends in albedo and SCDs by - 0.02 and - 0.52, respectively, and upward trends in the LST and NDVI data by 0.07 degrees C and 0.009, respectively. Due to the recent drought condition in Iran, SCDs decreased significantly, which might explain the reason behind the albedo decreases in winter time in Iran.					karbalaee, Ali Reza/AAD-6661-2022; Masoodian, Seyed Abolfazl/O-9912-2016; Masoodian, Seyed/N-4193-2019	karbalaee, alireza/0000-0002-1877-5045; Masoodian, Seyed Abolfazl/0000-0001-6227-6713; Keikhosravi Kiany, Mohammad Sadegh/0000-0002-8221-6264													0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2022	150	1-2					389	403		10.1007/s00704-022-04171-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04171-9		AUG 2022											WOS:000839545700002
J	Loso, MG				Loso, Michael G.			Summer temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age inferred from varved proglacial lake sediments in southern Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												For the heavily glaciated mountains of southern Alaska, few high-resolution, millennial-scale proxy temperature reconstructions are available for comparison with modern temperatures or with the history of glacier fluctuations. Recent catastrophic drainage of glacier-dammed Iceberg Lake, on the northern margin of the Bagley Icefield, exposed subaerial outcrops of varved lacustrine sediments that span the period 442-1998 AD. Here, an updated chronology of varve thickness measurements is used to quantitatively reconstruct melt-season temperature anomalies. From 1958 to 1998, varve thickness has a positive and marginally significant correlation with May-June temperatures at the nearest coastal measurement stations. Varve sensitivity to temperature has changed over time, however, in response to lake level changes in 1957 and earlier. I compensate for this by log-transforming the varve thickness chronology, and also by using a 400-year-long tree-ring-based temperature proxy to reconstruct melt-season temperatures at Iceberg Lake. Regression against this longer proxy record is statistically weak, but spans the full range of occupied lake levels and varve sensitivities. Reconstructed temperature anomalies have broad confidence intervals, but nominally span 1.1A degrees C over the last 1500+ years. Maximum temperatures occurred in the late twentieth century, with a minimum in the late sixth century. The Little Ice Age is present as three cool periods between 1350 and 1850 AD with maximum cooling around 1650 AD. A Medieval Warm Period is evident from 1000 to 1100 AD, but the temperature reconstruction suggests it was less warm than recent decades-an observation supported by independent geological evidence of recent glacier retreat that is unprecedented over the period of record.

After 20 kg MLS were sprayed in the whole water pond (400 m(2)), the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration was decreased from 42 to 18 mu g L-1 within 2 h and remained below 20 mu g L-1 in the following 15 months, while the average Chl-a was 36 mu g L-1 in the control pond throughout the experiment. In situ nutrient addition bioassay experiments indicated that the nutrient limitation was shifted from nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co-limitation to P limitation after MLS treatment from October 2013 to March 2014 compared to the control pond. In the cyanobacterial bloom season of June 2014, N and P co-limitation remained and N was the primary limiting nutrient and P was a secondary one in the control pond where phytoplankton biomass showed significant increase by N addition and further increase by N P additions, while both N and P became the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth where only combined N and P additions showed significant Chl-a stimulation in the treatment pond. In the next summer (June 2014), a cyanobacteria-dominated state still remained in the control pond but chlorophytes, bacillariophytes and cyanophytes distributed equally and submerged vegetation was largely restored in the treatment pond. Meanwhile, the upper limiting concentration of DIN was enhanced from 0.8 to 1.5 mg L-1 and SRP from 0.1 to 0.3 mg L-1 compared to the control pond. This study indicates that nutrient limitation can be manipulated by using MLS technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Together with other ecological data these chemical parameters can be used to interpret hydrological and hydrochemical conditions in ancient lake basins where analogous faunas have been recorded. An example of such a utilization of the biological record is presented for Miocene clastic-dominated lacustrine deposits of the Tertiary Ebro Basin of NE Spain, which contain marine-like fossils. Comparison of the deduced chemical parameters for the Miocene lake waters with the chemical composition of recent groundwaters and saline springs in the same area allows us to infer a similar mode of solute acquisition. This implies that there were important Cl-SO4 saline inflows to the Miocene lakes.

By day, planktonic bullies inhabited the metalimnion and after sunset moved to the epilimnion where water temperatures were close to the preferred temperature for growth of this species. Feeding activity increased at night but more so for the larger (13-18 mm) bullies, which preyed mainly on Bosmina, than for the smaller (5-12 mm) ones, which preyed mainly on copepods. The diel vertical migration of planktonic bullies was therefore associated with both increased feeding at night as well as with a thermoregulatory benefit, although smaller fish may have obtained more of a thermoregulatory benefit than a feeding one.																			0003-9136					FEB	1996	135	4					485	497																WOS:A1996TY05200004

J	Porter, D; Roychoudhury, AN; Cowan, D				Porter, Donovan; Roychoudhury, Alakendra N.; Cowan, Donald			Dissimilatory sulfate reduction in hypersaline coastal pans: Activity across a salinity gradient	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The impact of salinity on the metabolic activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in five highly saline to hypersaline coastal pans was studied using a radioactive tracer ((SO42-)-S-35) technique. We recorded sulfate reduction at in situ porewater salinities of up to 422. Furthermore, enumeration of sulfate reduction rates in whole core incubations conducted under in situ conditions suggested a high variability in the activity of sulfate-reducers. Average reduction rates (27-3685 nmol cm(-3) d(-1)) varied according to depth, season and site sampled. The highest reduction rates measured in the hypersaline pan were comparable to the highest reported rates from highly productive salt marsh and microbial mat ecosystems. Correspondingly, the depth-integrated rates (integrated to 12 cm) varied from 6 to 241 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and were also among the highest ever reported rates. The reduction rates decreased down-core and, surprisingly, were highest in the winter season when the lowest sediment temperatures were encountered. High salt concentrations did not inhibit sulfate reduction rates. Rather, higher rates were measured at pans with higher in situ salinities. In laboratory slurry incubation experiments, sediments from the saltpans were treated with increasing salt concentrations. Regression analysis suggested that the short term response of microbial consortia to up-shock was an increase in sulfate reduction activity up to salinities of 272-311 and 134-244, in hypersaline and highly saline pans, respectively. Beyond these salinities, the cells showed evidence of reduced activities. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	HONGVE, D				HONGVE, D			CHEMICAL STRATIFICATION AND STABILITY OF MEROMICTIC LAKES IN THE UPPER ROMERIKE DISTRICT	SCHWEIZERISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR HYDROLOGIE-SWISS JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The investigation includes 8 biogenic meromictic lakes in the Upper Romerike district in southeast Norway. Both the chemical gradients and stabilities were weak. In all lakes the stratification varied seasonally according to the autumnal circulation of the mixolimnion which also introduced some changes in the monimolimnion. The major part of the chemical stability was exerted by substances which originate from decomposition of organic matter. Most important was accumulation of CO2. Methane, ammonia and phosphate were accumulated in considerable amounts, while nitrate and sulfate became reduced. The reducing conditions were favorable for reduction and solution of Fe and Mn from the sediments. In most lakes Fe predominated. Two expressions for stability are defined. The instantaneous stability denotes the work required to circulate the lake in a manner which elevates all dissolved substances to the new center of gravity. The net stability is a minor value; it is the amount of work required for full circulation when O2 has been introduced into the monimolimnion and precipitation and sedimentation of Fe and Mn have taken place. The annual variation in monimolimnetic temperature increased with decreasing maximum depth, from 0.02.degree. C in the deepest lake (Zmax = 23 m) to 0.5.degree. C in the shallowest one (Zmax = 7 m). The work of the wind in warming a lake was used as an expression for its exposure to the wind. The values show that the lakes are very well sheltered. Up to 50% of the distribution of heat was performed by direct insolation. During a short period before freezing, full circulation was prevented by the chemical gradient in density. Some lakes possessed only a negligible chemical stability after this period; they may circulate in years with favorable weather conditions during the autumn. Some lakes are probably developing from meromixis to holomixis because of a successive filling of their basins with sediments.																			0036-7842						1981	42	2					171	195																WOS:A1981LP57100005

The research was conducted in 47 lakes with different trophic conditions in the middle of summer. Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones. We found 119 zooplankton species of which 32 were Cladocera, 16 were Cyclopoida, 4 were Calanoida, and 67 were Rotifera. We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.

The cryosphere environment, such as ice core samples, provides valuable palaeoclimate data. Palynology and dendroclimatology are also effective ways to study long-term changes in vegetation and reconstruct past climates using pollen and tree proxies. Sediment cores from various locations in Slovenia have been studied to understand past environmental changes. Borehole temperature profiles as well as historical records were also used to reconstruct past climate conditions.

Agricultural land management alters the biogeochemical cycling capacity of aquatic and sediment environments	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Nutrient loading from agricultural landscapes continues to pose a threat to downstream aquatic systems, contributing to degraded water quality and eutrophication. Nutrient loading to adjacent aquatic environments is influenced by the type of applied fertilizer (chemical and manure), field management, and seasonal weather patterns. The risk these nutrients pose to downstream systems may be mitigated by the capacity of the microbial community in receiving water catchments to process those nutrients. This study evaluated the interactive effects of agricultural practices and seasonal weather patterns on nutrient cycling communities in catchment ponds within a long-term Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research trial, located in the Lake Erie watershed in Ontario, Canada. Microbial nitrogen (N) and P (phosphorus)-cycling functions in water and sediment environments, receiving direct tile drainage and surface runoff flow, were quantified with respect to nutrient loads from liquid cow manure, solid cow manure, inorganic phosphorus, and a control fertilizer treatment, over a full year. High bacterial nitrification potential in the water column coincided with nitrogen loading, which was driven by manure/fertilizer application, tillage practices, and precipitation. The highest overall phosphorus concentrations occurred in the liquid cow manure treatment, but the availability of phosphorus in all treatments was strongly associated with microbial phosphorus mobilization capacity in both aquatic and sediment environments. Seasonality also influenced the aquatic environment, where N and P- cycling potential significantly increased during the winter months. Microbial functional potential in the water column was strongly influenced by the external environment, including season and precipitation, while the functional potential in the sediment was more resistant to environmental fluctuations, and was primarily influenced by long-term management fertilizer/ manure practices. Overall, this study provides evidence that agricultural management alters the capacity of the microbial communities in adjacent aquatic environments to process nutrients.

These habitats are valuable environmental assets. We analysed the impact of the surrounding land use on plant species composition, vegetation structure and water quality of 15 dune lakes in the coast of Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico. The physical and chemical characteristics were determined for water during both the dry and rainy seasons, and vegetation was sampled once. Ammonium, nitrate, orthophosphate and total phosphorus varied between seasons and among lakes. Multivariate analysis revealed a gradient from lakes in a good state (water and wetland vegetation) to degraded lakes. These lakes fall into two groups: the first one has five lakes with a higher nutrient content, and surrounded by land where livestock is pastured and sugarcane is grown. The vegetation of these lakes consists of a combination of aquatic plants and flood-tolerant grasses introduced to feed cattle (Cynodon dactylon, Pennisetum purpureum, Setaria geniculata). Oligotrophic and mildly eutrophic lakes are characterised by little human activity, and aquatic species predominate (Cabomba palaeformis, Nymphaea ampla, Acrostichum aureum). Rural activities such as sugarcane cultivation and cattle rearing are likely the main factors causing changes in water enrichment and affecting the composition and structure of wetland vegetation. Management measures should be implemented to recover these areas and prevent further deterioration.

Mortality was attributed largely to chlamydiosis. Necropsy findings in nine carcasses included splenomegaly (n = 9), hepatomegaly (n = 4), and pericarditis (n = 1). Livers from three California gulls and two ring-billed gulls, and spleens from the same five birds plus a third ring-billed gull were positive for Chlamydia psittaci by the direct immunofluorescence test. Chlamydia psittaci was isolated from separate pools of liver and spleen from one California gull and one ring-billed gull. This is believed to be the first record of epizootic chlamydiosis in gulls and the second report of epizootic chlamydial mortality in wild birds in North America.

Waterbirds as indicators of ecosystem health in the coastal marine habitats of southern Florida: 1. Selection and justification for a suite of indicator species	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The coastal marine environment is currently under threat from many anthropogenic pressures that were identified by the MARES project. Indicators of ecosystem health are needed so that targets can be set to guide protection and restoration efforts. Species of birds that are dependent on coastal habitats are ubiquitous along the coasts of southern Florida. Generally referred to as waterbirds, these species, although not all taxonomically related, share a common dependency on the marine environment for food, nesting habitat, or both. A suite of waterbirds was selected based on their perceived sensitivity to pressures in multiple coastal habitat types. The list of species was refined on the basis of a review of life history for characteristics that might make the species particularly vulnerable. Each selected species was then evaluated for sensitivity to the identified pressures using a hierarchical assessment that took into account the sensitivity, severity, and the temporal and spatial scales of the indicator to the given pressures. The selected suite of indicators was collectively sensitive to all the pressures except one. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	ELLIOTT, CCH				ELLIOTT, CCH			HARVEST TIME METHOD AS A MEANS OF AVOIDING QUELEA DAMAGE TO IRRIGATED RICE IN CHAD CAMEROON	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Studies on bird damage to irrigated rice were conducted from 1975-1977 on irrigated farms at Bongor, Chad and Yagoua, Cameroun. The level of damage in relation to the timing of the harvest was measured in order to assess the effectiveness of the harvest timing method of avoiding damage by migratory birds. The quelea [Quelea quelea] was considered the only serious bird pest. Observations on the movements of the Lake Chad Basin quelea population and on the time of arrival of the birds in the rice fields, suggested that the safe periods for the vulnerable stages of the rice crop was relatively short, from about mid-May to mid-June. In 1 season, the Yagoua harvest fell within this period and damage was negligible at < 1%. On the other occasions, when the harvest overlapped with the birds'' arrival, damage varied from 13-26%. The reasons for these differences are discussed. While the harvest timing method can eliminated quelea damage in some years, the practical difficulty of timing the crop to a precise period means that, in other years, when the harvest is late because of unforeseen circumstances, the spraying of nearby roosts with avicides by bird control units will be necessary.																			0021-8901	1365-2664					1979	16	1					23	35		10.2307/2402725	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2402725													WOS:A1979HE05600002

The gas and condensate were collected from the active crater in bocca, which was formed in June 2010. The chemical composition and the delta O-18 and delta D values of the condensate and lake water were analyzed. In comparison with the isotopic data on volcanic condensates of the adjacent Mutnovskii volcano, the data points of samples from Gorelyi volcano fall to the mixing line of meteoric and magmatic water. The isotopic characteristics of the water component of the fluid mostly correspond to the high-temperature equilibrium with silicate rocks or melts; the portion of local meteoric water is 25%. The high metal content of gases of the volcano is determined. The total removal of Cu, Zn, Pb, Mo, Cd, In, Sn, Tl, and Bi by gases of Gorelyi volcano (30 t/year) comparable to that of the Kudryavyi volcano (20-80 t/year) indicates the high ore-bearing capacity of the volcanic gas fluids.					; Chaplygin, Ilya/D-9136-2015; Dubinina, Elena/A-8694-2014	Chaplygin, Ilya/0000-0001-6762-6727; 													1028-334X	1531-8354				JUL	2015	463	1					690	694		10.1134/S1028334X15050104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1028334X15050104													WOS:000358795300008

Quantifying Recruitment Compensation in Florida Largemouth Bass, with Implications for Fisheries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish populations that undergo heavy exploitation and those for which the act of fishing can influence individual brood success are at risk of recruitment effects due to angling. The angling of brood-guarding male black bass Micropterus spp. has been shown to decrease brood success, although there is no evidence that a loss of individual broods has population-level impacts. Therefore, some level of recruitment compensation may influence juvenile bass survival. We sought to measure recruitment compensation and the form of the stock-recruit relationship for a brood-guarding species, the Florida Largemouth Bass M. salmoides floridanus ( hereafter, Florida Bass). The study was conducted in four north-central Florida lakes during 4 years ( 2010-2013). We quantified adult stock density by using mark-recapture electrofishing surveys. The estimated broods produced in each spawning season, the number of those broods that were successful, and the age-1 recruit density were quantified via snorkel surveys. We evaluated three models for describing the effects of stock density or successful brood density on recruitment: a proportional ( linear; i.e., no compensation) model, a Ricker ( dome-shaped) model, and a Beverton-Holt ( asymptotic) model. Recruit density was better indicated by the number of successful broods produced than by spawning stock density. Model comparisons indicated that the density-dependent models had the most support, whereas there was no apparent support for the proportional or density-independent model. The Ricker model had the most empirical support overall ( estimated parameters: a = 2.2, b = 0.009). Our results indicate that the number of successful broods would have to fall below about 5 broods/ha to generate direct declines in observed average recruitment of Florida Bass.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	3					462	475		10.1080/00028487.2015.1131744	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1131744													WOS:000379058600003

In Washington State the bass tapeworm apparently infects salmonids only in environments shared with largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), an essential definitive host of the cestode. Infection of trout occurs during the summer in correlation with warm water temperatures (60 - 67 F.) and the reproduction of adult cestodes in bass. Young cutthroat (Salmo clarki) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) also readily acquire the parasites, but lacustrine coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) appear relatively resistant. Elimination of the bass tapeworm from lakes of the Pacific Northwest through modification of routine rehabilitation and stocking procedures is discussed. Only uninfected bass should be planted in lakes intended primarily for trout production.																			0033-0779						1968	30	2					76	+		10.1577/1548-8640(1968)30[76:TBT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1968)30[76:TBT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1968A992600002

Seasonal and Flood-Induced Variations in Groundwater-Surface Water Exchange in a Northern Coldwater Fishery	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Groundwater upwelling is important to coldwater fisheries survival. This study used stable isotopes to identify upwelling zones within a watershed, then combined isotope analyses with reach-scale monitoring to measure surface water-groundwater exchange over time. Research focused on Amity Creek, Minnesota, a basin that exemplifies conditions limiting coldwater species survival along Lake Superior's North Shore where shallow bedrock limits groundwater capacity, lowering baseflows and increasing temperatures. Groundwater-fed reaches were identified through synoptic isotope sampling, with results highlighting the importance of isolated shallow surficial aquifers (glacially derived sands and gravels) for providing cold baseflow waters. In an alluvial reach, monitoring well results show groundwater was stored in two reservoirs: one that reacts quickly to changes in stream levels, and one that remained isotopically isolated under most flow conditions, but which helps sustain summer baseflows for weeks to months. A 500-year flood demonstrated the capacity of high-flow events to alter surface water-groundwater connectivity. The previously isolated reservoir was exchanged or mixed during the flood pulse, while incision lowered the water table for years. The results here provide insight for streams that lack substantial groundwater inputs yet maintain coldwater species at risk in a warming climate and an approach for managers seeking to protect cold baseflow sources.					; Gran, Karen/NXX-5369-2025	Magner, Joseph or Joe/0000-0001-8775-5112; Gran, Karen/0000-0001-9832-3016; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2018	54	5					1109	1126		10.1111/1752-1688.12674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12674													WOS:000446264500009

Warming and nutrient enrichment in combination increase stochasticity and beta diversity of bacterioplankton assemblages across freshwater mesocosms	ISME JOURNAL												The current climate warming and eutrophication are known to interactively threaten freshwater biodiversity; however, the interactive effects on lacustrine bacterioplankton diversity remain to be determined. Here, we analyzed the spring bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) in 24 outdoor, flow-through mesocosms (mimicking shallow lake environments) under 3 temperature scenarios and 2 nutrient regimes. Our results revealed that neither long-term warming (8.5 years) nor nutrient enrichment had significant effects on bacterioplankton alpha diversity, whereas long-term enhanced warming (elevated 50% above the IPCC A2 climate scenario) and nutrient enrichment in combination increased bacterioplankton beta diversity. We also found that BCC shifted significantly under enhanced warming and nutrient-enriched conditions towards decreased relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria, whereas the percentages of Cyanobacteria, total rare phyla and unclassified phyla significantly increased. Null-model tests indicated that deterministic processes played a more important role than stochastic processes in determining BCC. However, the relative importance of stochasticity, primarily ecological drift, was enhanced and contributed to the increased beta diversity of BCC under enhanced warming and nutrient-enriched conditions.

The modeling revealed that wind stress was the key driver of the observed internal waves while the role of water withdrawal was negligible. Our results also showed that within the range of wind speeds considered, wind-induced upwelling greatly enhanced mixing between the hypolimnion and epilimnion with a rate that varies approximately as the square of the wind speed. This numerical correlation affirmed that processes connected to wind stress, i.e. internal waves or direct upwelling, were responsible for the mixing of the hypolimnetic water into the surface water rather than direct input of turbulent kinetic energy.

J	Varol, S; Köse, I				Varol, Simge; Kose, Ilknur			Effect on human health of the arsenic pollution and hydrogeochemistry of the Yazir Lake wetland (Cavdir-Burdur/Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this study, the physicochemical parameters, major ions and arsenic (As) contents of water resources in the Yazir lake wetland, were evaluated. In addition, water resources in this region were investigated from the point of water quality and health risk assessment. Thirty water samples were collected from the area in dry and wet seasons. Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Ca-HCO3 were the dominant water types. The Gibbs diagram suggests that most of the samples fall in rock-dominance zone, which indicates the groundwater interaction between rock chemistry. When compared to drinking water guidelines established by World Health Organization and Turkey, much greater attention should be paid to As, Fe, and Mn through varied chemicals above the critical values. According to the pH-ORP diagram, the predominant species is arsenate (H2AsO4-2). The high concentrations of As in the surface water and groundwater are related to oxidative and reductive dissolution reaction of Fe and Mn hydroxides within the Kizilcadag ophiolite and melange. In addition, the seasonal changes in As concentrations depend on the increase in pH of water samples. The major toxic and carcinogenic chemical within water samples is As for groundwater and surface water. From the results of hazard index, it is verified that As which is taken by ingestion of water was the main contaminant, and toxic human risk in the study area. The obtained results will help define strategies for As problems in the water resources in future.

J	Branfireun, BA; Hilbert, D; Roulet, NT				Branfireun, BA; Hilbert, D; Roulet, NT			Sinks and sources of methylmercury in a boreal catchment	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												A simple, catchment-scale, cascade model was used to assess the importance of sinks and sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in a boreal catchment that contains a forested upland, a lowland peatland and a small lake. The three compartment model was run using realistic flow rates and atmospheric loading of MeHg, and the model was constrained by observed concentrations of MeHg in each compartment. Assuming no internal sinks and sources of MeHg, modelled catchment yields showed reasonable agreement with field observation, but the predicted internal MeHg concentrations in each compartment were implausible. Only when sources and sinks of MeHg are added to the three compartments do MeHg-pool concentrations fall into the range of those measured in the field. To maintain both catchment-scale and compartment-scale continuity, the upland and peatland were net sources of MeHg (0.0007 and 0.1065 mg ha(-1) d(-1) respectively), and the lake a net sink (-0.2215 mg ha(-1) d(-1)). These source/sink rates are 1.73, 259 and -539 times the input of MeHg via wet precipitation input for the modelled ice-free season. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the volume of runoff delivered to the peatland by the upland area, peatland size and porewater MeHg concentration in the peatland an important controls on catchment MeHg yield, and that contemporary atmospheric deposition of MeHg is insignificant compared to the sources of MeHg within the catchment.

J	WEISS, W; LEHN, H; MUNNICH, KO; FISCHER, KH				WEISS, W; LEHN, H; MUNNICH, KO; FISCHER, KH			DEEP-WATER TURNOVER OF LAKE CONSTANCE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												From the distribution of tritium and temperature in Lake Constance (1963-1976) the deep water renewal rate is estimated. A long-term mean of the annual renewal rate of about 1.permill. per day is estimated. The renewal is by 2 processes; the overturn of the lake in winter and vertical mixing across the thermocline during the stratification period. The corresponding turnovertimes are 5 and 7 yr, respectively. Vertical mixing in the lake exhibits a strong seasonal and year to year variability. The seasonal variability is related to the stability of the water column: vertical mixing during the stratification is characterized by apparent eddy diffusivities between 0.2-1 cm2/s whereas much higher figures up to 20 cm2/s are observed in March and April. Temperature data indicative that part of the renewal is by downwelling of the Alpenrhine. As the outflow is restricted to the epilimnion such downwelling events must be compensated by areal or local upwelling. From the temperature data of 1964 (dry year) and 1965 (wet year) vertical mixing in the lake strongly depends on the the inflow rate of the Alpenrhine. During the stratification, P recycling from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion is of the same order of magnitude as the external P load of the lake.																			0003-9136						1979	86	4					405	422																WOS:A1979HR18200001

The total OCPs fell in the range of n.d-49.74 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (dw), which was dominated by DDTs and endosulfan. Identification of pollution sources indicated new input of DDTs for malaria control in Kenya. The total PCBs ranged from n.d. to 55.49 mu g kg(-1) dw, dominated by penta- and hexa-PCBs, probably associated with the leakage of obsolete transformer oil. The soils were less contaminated by PBDEs, ranging from 0.19 to 35.64 mu g kg(-1) dw. The predominant PBDE congeners were penta-, tri- or tetra-BDEs, varying among different sampling sites. Risk assessment indicated potential human health risks posed by OCs in soils from Kenya, with PCBs as the most contributing pollutants. The local authorities are recommended to make best efforts on management of OC pollution, particularly from DDTs and PCBs to meet the requirement of Stockholm Convention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of ikaite precipitation on phosphate (PO4) concentration has not been considered so far. Experiments were set up at pH from 8.5 to 10.0, salinities from 0 to 105, temperatures from -4 degrees C to 0 degrees C, and PO4 concentrations from 5 to 50 mu mol kg(-1) in artificial sea ice brine so as to understand how ikaite precipitation affects the PO4 concentration in sea ice under different conditions. Our results show that PO4 is coprecipitated with ikaite under all experimental conditions. The amount of PO4 removed by ikaite precipitation increases with increasing pH. Changes in salinity (S35) as well as temperature have little impact on PO4 removal by ikaite precipitation. The initial PO4 concentration affects the PO4 coprecipitation. These findings may shed some light on the observed variability of PO4 concentration in sea ice.					; Dieckmann, Gerhard/B-4307-2010; Hu, Yubin/AAV-9749-2021; Nehrke, Gernot/LZG-2902-2025; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter/E-7666-2010	Nehrke, Gernot/0000-0002-2851-3049; Hu, Yubin/0000-0003-0897-2210; Wolf-Gladrow, Dieter/0000-0001-9531-8668; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT	2014	119	10					7007	7015		10.1002/2014JC010079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010079													WOS:000345499700028

Hens began leaving Suisun Marsh in late May, and 50% had departed by mid-June. We located 27 of 34 hens from late June through September during aerial searches; 25 hens had migrated north out of the study area, and two remained near the nesting area. We determined the molting areas of 20 hens: nine in Oregon and 11 in California. These molting areas were 12-536 km from nesting sites. Wetlands used by molting Mallards were dominated by bulrush (Scirpus spp.) and cattail (Typha spp.), were traditionally flooded during summer, and often associated with lakes or rivers. Molting areas of seven hens located at least once after leaving the study area were not determined, and seven other hens were never relocated indicating probable migration north of the search area. Two hens were recaptured in 1988 and radio-tracked to molting areas used the previous year, 121 and 484 km north of the breeding area. Mallards appear to exhibit site fidelity to molting areas. Migrating to an area with preferred molting habitat may enhance survival during the flightless period and early part of the hunting season.																			0010-5422	1938-5129				FEB	1994	96	1					36	45		10.2307/1369061	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369061													WOS:A1994MZ18900004

In this paper, we estimate gillnet catchability of Walleye for two standard sampling protocols: the North American (NA) and the Fall Walleye Index Netting (FWIN), allowing the conversion of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) into absolute estimates of fish density or abundance. We combined mark-recapture studies from 14 lakes in Ontario and Quebec, 11 of which were concurrently sampled using NA and FWIN methods, totalling 53 recapture surveys from 1996 to 2012. To account for lake-specific influences on catchability, we analyzed the data with Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) using lake as a random factor and a model-averaging approach to calculate mean estimates and variances. Catchability for Walleye >= 350mm total length was L04 ha/gang for the, FWIN, meaning each fish caught in a FWIN net gang (1.8 x 61 m) represents roughly one fish per hectare. Catchability for one gang of NA net (1.8 x 24.8 m) was 0.52 ha/gang, which is 20% higher than FWIN catchability after accounting for net area. Two important sources of variation in catchability were: (i) lake-specific differences and (ii) seasonal changes within the NA protocol. The mechanisms underlying such variation arc still not clear and will require additional studies covering a broader geographic range to reveal potential environment-catchability relationships. We provide recommendations for estimating Walleye density and confidence intervals, and for how to combine our catchability estimates with size-selectivity curves to predict density at any specific size interval.					; Chu, C/C-9091-2009	Giacomini, Henrique/0000-0002-6932-464X; Chu, Cindy/0000-0002-1914-3218													0165-7836	1872-6763				APR	2020	224								105433	10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105433													WOS:000514752000008

Using noble gases to analyze the efficiency of artificial aeration in Lake Hallwil, Switzerland	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Eutrophic Lake Hallwil (Switzerland) is equipped with an artificial aeration system to prevent anoxic conditions developing in the deep water during stratification in summer. The aeration system consists of diffusers releasing oxygen- rich gas containing noble gases into the deep water at the bottom of the lake. The deep water is strongly supersaturated with He, Ne, and Ar, while Kr and Xe are present at concentrations corresponding to their respective atmospheric equilibria. The observed noble gas excesses are related to the operation of the aeration system and to the composition of the injected aeration gas. We show how noble gas data were used successfully to estimate the fraction of the injected aeration gas that effectively remains dissolved in the water body. In particular, as the physical properties of Ar (e.g., atomic mass, solubility, diffusion coefficient) are similar to those of oxygen, the measured noble gas concentrations allow the efficiency of the aeration system to be quantified.					; Tomonaga, Yama/ABG-9540-2020	Tomonaga, Yama/0000-0003-2871-8826; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP 20	2012	48								W09531	10.1029/2012WR012030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012WR012030													WOS:000309137400004

The saline Rogoznica Lake ("Dragon Eye"), situated on the Eastern Adriatic coast is such a system (10 276 m(2), 15 m deep) typical of many stratified, sulfide rich water bodies. The depth of mixolimnion changes seasonally and it is greatly influenced by meteorological conditions, i.e. temperature and rainfall. Vertical mixing usually occurs during winter when cold, oxygen-rich water from the surface sinks downwards. In 2009 we monitored seasonal distribution and variation of copper complexing capacity (L-T), related apparent stability constants (K-app), concentration of Cu2+ ions, surfactant activity (SAS), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and reduced sulfur species (RSS). Our results have shown that LT is increasing with depth up to 8 m depth, while the concentrations of copper ions decrease with the depth due to the higher amount of RSS species in deeper layers. The values of log Kapp are also decreasing with depth as a consequence of a competition of organic ligands and sulfide ions for binding Cu. Below 8 m depth the presence of high amounts of RSS (similar to 1 mM) influences the electrochemical measuring of copper ion and LT determination, contributing to the copper ion binding.

To determine the influences of such differences in seagrass life cycles on fish assemblage structures, fish sampling and environmental measurements were conducted in annual and perennial seagrass beds, as well as on bare sand/mud flats, in Lake Hamana, central Japan. The perennial and annual seagrass beds harbored similar levels of fish species richness and abundances when the latter beds were flourishing, whereas the numbers of fish species and individuals showed a relative decrease in the annual beds and sand/mud flats during seasonal die-off. Such fish occurrence patterns were primarily determined by permanent seagrass habitat residents, seasonal residents and transients, which showed different occurrence patterns in each seagrass bed. Permanent residents preferred perennial seagrass beds, with the constant availability of seagrass vegetation structure likely being an essential habitat requirement. Seasonal residents showed different occurrence patterns, being abundant in the annual seagrass beds during periods of flourishing growth, sometimes exceeding levels in the perennial beds. Such fishes may use complex seagrass structures for only restricted periods. In contrast, transients did not show any elevated habitat use for a particular seagrass habitat structure, probably because of the lesser importance of the seagrass habitat as a feeding ground.

Improved understanding of the impact of atmospheric circulation on stream discharge variability into the Lakes is thus important. In this analysis, monthly surface and mid-tropospheric circulation patterns suggest that surface pressure variations over Missouri and Illinois are most strongly correlated to disc charge. The mid-tropospheric patterns most directly related to discharge place the Great Lakes in a trough-to-ridge flow pattern. The analysis confirms that at this scale, lee shore advection resulting in 'lake-effect' precipitation is not very important to regional discharge, and neither are variations in the Pacific-North American teleconnection.

Ladinian ?) are described and interpreted on the basis of lithology, sedimentary structures are sequential pattern. The basal Kolledalen Member consists in the northwestern part of the area of coarse-grained alluvial-fan deposits overlain by cross-bedded aeolian sandstones and finer-grained sabkha or shallow desert-lake deposits. The overlying Kap Seaforth Member displays well-developed cyclic sedimentation. In the southeastern part of the area the ideal cycle consists of, from bottom to top: cross-bedded aeolian sandstone, structureless or wave-rippled sandstone of sabha flat-marginal desert-lake origin, thin wave-rippled sandstone and irregularly bedded mudstone of marginal desert-lake origin and horizontally laminated mudstone deposited in an expanded desert lake. Foreset dips of the cross-bedded aeolian sandstones suggest alternating periods of north-northeast and south-southeast palaeowinds. The aeolian deposits of the Gipsdalen Formation were apparently deposited at low palaeolatitudes in the northern hemisphere. In the Middle Triassic summer seasons the Intertropical Convergence Zone probably lay north of the Jameson Land Basin, which was reached by south-southeast trade winds. During the rest of the year the zone was situated to the south and the area came under the influence of north-northeast trade winds.

Temporal and spatial variation in planktonic abundance, biomass and composition were determined in Lake Hoare (McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica) over two summer seasons (1996-97 and 1997-98). 2. Phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN) dominated planktonic biomass, with a mean monthly biomass ranging between 27.3 and 40.4 mug C L-1. The deep chlorophyll maximum was mainly composed of cryptophytes (>87% of total PNAN biomass) and varied in depth between 6 and 12 m. 3. Maximum bacterial concentration was 11.8 x 10(5) cells mL(-1). Bacterial abundance showed relatively little temporal variation, with the exception of a drop in numbers that occurred in late November of both years studied. 4. Ciliates were the most successful heterotrophic protozoan group, with a mean monthly biomass (1.2-3.2 mug C L-1) being typically at least double that of heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNAN) biomass (0.1-0.7 mug C L-1). 5. Microbial processes within this lake appear to be dominated by bottom up control. The relative importance of allochthonous inputs into the lake (from the ice-cover and stream flow) and autochthonous recycling (by microzooplankton regeneration) are considered. 6. Results from a horizontal transect indicate that the permanence of the main sample hole may have enhanced planktonic biomass over a relatively small spatial scale.																			0046-5070					JUL	2004	49	7					853	869		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01230.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01230.x													WOS:000222069900001
J	Torma, P; Wu, CH				Torma, Peter; Wu, Chin H.			Temperature and Circulation Dynamics in a Small and Shallow Lake: Effects of Weak Stratification and Littoral Submerged Macrophytes	WATER												In this paper, the effects of littoral submerged macrophytes on weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are investigated. Diverse submerged macrophytes occupying a large portion of the littoral zone act as resistance to water motions and affect lake hydrodynamics. Strong solar radiation and mild wind forcing typically occurring during the summer season result in weak stratification characterized by a diurnal cycle with a temperature differential of 1-3 degrees C. Temperature and circulation dynamics of a small and shallow lake are depicted by extensive field measurements and a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model with a generic length scale (GLS) approach for the turbulence closure and drag forces induced by macrophytes. Results show that the effects of macrophytes on velocity profiles are apparent. In the pelagic area, the circulation patterns with and without macrophytes are similar. The velocity profile is generally characterized by a two-layer structure with the maximum velocity at both the water surface and the mid-depth. In contrast, inside the littoral zone, the mean flow is retarded by macrophytes and the velocity profile is changed to only one maximum velocity at the surface with a steeper decrease until 2.0 m depth and another slight decrease to the lake bottom. From the whole lake perspective, littoral macrophytes dampen the horizontal water temperature difference between the upwind side and download side of the lake. Macrophytes promote a stronger temperature stratification by retarding mean flows and reducing vertical mixing. Overall, this study shows that the temperature structures and circulation patterns under weak stratification conditions in a small and shallow lake are strongly affected by littoral vegetation.

J	Díaz-Espejo, A; Serrano, L; Toja, J				Díaz-Espejo, A; Serrano, L; Toja, J			Changes in sediment phosphate composition of seasonal ponds during filling	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Most ponds from the Donana National Park are shallow temporary freshwater bodies on eolian sands. The total phosphate concentration and the fractional P-composition of the sediments from two small ponds were studied before and inmediately after they were filled (autumn, 1996). Total phosphorus concentration was measured in 2 different size fractions: 2-0.1 mm (coarse) and <0.1 mm (fine). In both ponds, the total phosphorus concentration of the fine sediment increased by 20% at the beginning of the filling period, whereas 5 weeks later it did not increase further. The percentage of organic matter of the fine sediment was relatively high (between 13-18%) and did not change significantly during filling. The concentration of sediment total iron and Fe(OOH) increased significantly in both ponds during filling. The sequential P fractionation of the fine sediment included, besides the determination of two inorganic fractions (Ca-bound P and Fe-bound P), an organic-P fraction extracted with acid, another extracted with alkali, two organic-P fractios from the Ca-EDTA/dithionite and the Na-2-EDTA extracts which contained high concentrations of humic substances. The pond sediments were rich in organic P compounds as the sum of all organic-P fractions ranged between 267 and 320 mu g g(-1) (68% and 79% of the sum of all fractions). Significant changes (P<0.01) in the fractional P-composition of sediments were found after filling. Acid soluble organic phosphate increased about 30% in both ponds. Iron-bound phosphate increased significantly (about 40%) only in the pond where a higher concentration of Fe(OOH) was measured after filling. An adsorption experiment was carried out for each sediment to simulate P input during filling. Both the iron-bound phosphate and Ca-bound P increased significantly (P<0.01) suggesting that these two fractions were involved in the P-adsorption during the laboratory experiment.

The pre-dam topography was reconstructed based on archival aerial imagery and old maps. The benefits and drawbacks of these methods were tested and explained with emphasis on the fact that not all processed archival data are suitable for pre-dam topography modeling. Bathymetric surveying of a reservoir bottom is presently routine, but in this study, we used a wide combination of bathymetric mapping methods (sonar, ground penetration radar, and sub-bottom profiler) and topographic survey tools (LiDAR and photogrammetry), bringing great benefits for bottom dynamic analysis and data cross-validation. The data that we gathered made it possible to evaluate the formation of the inflow deltas in the reservoirs studied and assess the sediment reworking during recent seasonal drawdowns. A typical inflow delta was formed in the deeper of the two studied reservoirs, while the summer 2019 drawdown caused the formation and incision of a temporary drawdown channel and erosive downstream transport of approximately 1/10 of the delta body thickness in approximately 1/10 of the delta transverse size. No inflow delta was formed in the shallower of the studied reservoirs, but unexpectedly extensive sediment reworking was observed in the inflow part of the reservoir. Both the studied reservoirs and the pre-dam river floodplain have accumulated historical contamination by risk elements such as As, Hg, Pb; thus, the enhanced erosion of existing sediment bodies expected in the future, owing to more frequent droughts and global climate change, will endanger the ecological quality of the water and solids outflowing from the reservoirs.					; Štojdl, Jiří/ABB-5609-2020; Dolejs, Martin/A-5704-2018; Pacina, Jan/C-7500-2015; Lenďáková, Zuzana/MBH-3879-2025; Dolejš, Martin/A-5704-2018	Stojdl, Jiri/0000-0002-8076-1007; Dolejs, Martin/0000-0002-7821-897X; Pacina, Jan/0000-0002-7241-0274; 														2220-9964				APR	2020	9	4							258	10.3390/ijgi9040258	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9040258													WOS:000539535700073

A silty clay bed formed in the study area at 11 200-9300 cal yr BP, according to ostracod subfossils (e. g. Tonnacypris estonica, Leucocythere mirabilis, Limnocytherina sanctipatricii) in an oxygen-rich cool and oligotrophic profundal lacustrine environment, with an inflow of surface waters through springs. The record of specific ostracods (e. g. Cyclocypris ovum, Cypridopsis vidua, Metacypris cordata) reflects littoral environments, ongoing eutrophication, temperature increase and a progressive shallowing of the lake in the early Holocene (9300-7400 cal yr BP) when the tufa bed accumulated. A slight cooling and productivity decrease at 9100-8600 cal yr BP preceded further temperature rise and water level lowering, leading to the development of a eutrophic lake and cease of tufa precipitation (8600-7400 cal yr BP).

J	Matveev, VF				Matveev, Vladimir F.			Assessing the biomass of small fish with a split-beam sonar in the Murray River, Australia	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Split-beam hydroacoustics revealed large numbers of small fish in the lower reaches of the Murray River in autumn. At slow-flow sites, acoustically estimated fish biomass could reach 102 kg/ha in mid channel, which compares with the biomass level of planktivorous fish in eutrophic lakes. These results were confirmed by direct catches with a push net of Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and juvenile bony herring (Nematalosa erebi) ranging in length from 18 to 150 mm. Fish densities in the river channel doubled at night compared to the day. The density and total biomass estimates from net catches were strongly correlated with the acoustic data. However, the catch estimates were only 50-60% of the acoustic measurements, which is explained by the limited netting efficiency. The two methods produced similar estimates of fish mean weights. These results suggest that the density and biomass of small fish in open water habitats of the river can be reliably determined with acoustics. The high biomass of planktivorous fish and the diverse zooplankton community found in the same habitat suggest that the fish probably exploit an advantageous ecological niche in the main channel of the Lower Murray. The high biomass of small fish in this reach of the river, which has previously been underestimated, provides a large potential food source for native predators.

J	Boyce, ES; Motyka, RJ; Truffer, M				Boyce, Eleanor S.; Motyka, Roman J.; Truffer, Martin			Flotation and retreat of a lake-calving terminus, Mendenhall Glacier, Southeast Alaska, USA	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Mendenhall Glacier is a lake-calving glacier in southeastern Alaska, USA, that is experiencing substantial thinning and increasingly rapid recession. Long-term mass wastage linked to climatic trends is responsible for thinning of the lower glacier and leaving the terminus vulnerable to buoyancy-driven calving and accelerated retreat. Bedrock topography has played a major role in stabilizing the terminus between periods of rapid calving and retreat. Lake-terminating glaciers form a population distinct from both tidewater glaciers and polar ice tongues, with some similarities to both groups. Lacustrine termini experience fewer perturbations (e.g. tidal flexure, high subaqueous melt rates) and are therefore inherently more stable than tidewater termini. At Mendenhall, rapid thinning and simultaneous retreat into a deeper basin led to flotation conditions along approximately 50% of the calving front. This unstable terminus geometry lasted for approximately 2 years and culminated in large-scale calving and terminus collapse during summer 2004. Buoyancy-driven calving events and terminus break-up can result from small, rapidly applied perturbations in lake level.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2007	53	181					211	224		10.3189/172756507782202928	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756507782202928													WOS:000248073500006

Both oxygen and carbon isotope ratios show consistent trends through time, apparently in response to significant environmental changes. Maximum .delta.18O levels of -12.0 on average are found in the Boreal Chronozone and minimum levels of -13.3 on average in the Subboreal Chronozone, with intermediate values during Atlantic time. A sharp decline occurs at the Atlantic/Subboreal transition between 5,000 and 4,000 years B.P. The .delta.18O trends are primarily believed to reflect trends in summer temperatures. The results from Lake Vanhalampi are compared with those from Lake Narotch in northwestern Belorussia [USSR].

Developing a better understanding of the short-term and long-term development of these features is needed to constrain DCG evolution and the hazards posed to downstream communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure from rapid drainage. In this study, we present an analysis of supraglacial lakes on eight DCGs in the Khumbu region of Nepal by automating SGL identification in PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 5-9 images. We identify a regular annual cycle in SGL area, with lakes covering approximately twice as much area during their maximum annual extent (in the pre-monsoon season) than their minimum annual extent (in the post-monsoon season). The high spatiotemporal resolution of PlanetScope imagery ( similar to daily, 3 m ) shows that this cycle is driven by the appearance and expansion of small lakes in the upper debris-covered regions of these glaciers throughout the winter. Decadal-scale expansion of large, near-terminus lakes was identified on four of the glaciers (Khumbu, Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ambulapcha), while the remaining four showed no significant increases over the study period. The seasonal variation in SGL area is of comparable or greater magnitude as decadal-scale changes, highlighting the importance of accounting for this seasonality when interpreting long-term records of SGL changes from sparse observations. The complex spatiotemporal patterns revealed in our analysis are not captured in existing regional-scale glacial lake databases, suggesting that more targeted efforts are needed to capture the true variability of SGLs on large scales.

J	Jokela, J; Taskinen, J; Mutikainen, P; Kopp, K				Jokela, J; Taskinen, J; Mutikainen, P; Kopp, K			Virulence of parasites in hosts under environmental stress: experiments with anoxia and starvation	OIKOS												Most environments periodically impose severe stress that may cause high mortality and alter population structure, for example, by removing sick and old individuals. We examined how anoxic conditions and starvation of the host affect virulence of two closely related trematode parasites, Rhipidocotyle campanula and R. fennica. These parasites differ by prevalence of infection and by exploitation rate of individual hosts (freshwater clam, Anodonta piscinalis). Infection by R. campanula is rare (<5% prevalence of infection) and destroys on average 90% of the gonad tissue of the individual host. Infection by R. fennica is more common (20-60% prevalence of infection) and leads to on average 30% gonad destruction. In the end, both infections lead to host infertility. We predicted that R. campanula induces higher host mortality than R. fennica under host stress. In two laboratory experiments, we exposed naturally-infected and uninfected clams to anoxia and to starvation. Anoxia occasionally takes place during winter in eutrophic lakes, while some degree of starvation should occur seasonally. We found that mortality rate of clams was much higher under anoxia than under starvation, and that infection increased mortality rate under both types of host stress. As predicted, R. campanula induced higher host mortality than R. fennica. Host survival was population-specific, suggesting that clams of different origins carried different amount of energy reserves. Severe environmental perturbation may remove R. campanula infected individuals from the host population, but recolonization from the fish host is likely to prevent extinction of the parasite suprapopulation. The observed high host mortality induced by R. campanula may be one ecological explanation for the consistently lower prevalence of infection of R. campanula when compared to R. fennica.					; Taskinen, Jouni/AAK-5979-2020; Kopp, Kirstin/G-3513-2010	Jokela, Jukka/0000-0002-1731-727X; Kopp, Kirstin/0000-0001-5485-5379; 													0030-1299					JAN	2005	108	1					156	164		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13185.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13185.x													WOS:000225578700015

Species numbers were positively related to lake surface area but not trophic state. There were some shifts in species composition with changes in trophic state, though only a few species showed significant changes in their standing crops. In particular the recreationally important centrarchids did not show important changes with trophic state, and there were no critical points on the trophic spectrum where there were dramatic changes in fish abundance or standing crops. The facts that Florida lakes do not have deep, cold hypolimnia, do not have salmonid species, and have no ice in the winter are among the possible reasons that the more eutrophic Florida lakes do nor show the same changes in fish populations often described for northern lakes.

J	James, WF; Barko, JW; Field, SJ				James, WF; Barko, JW; Field, SJ			Phosphorus mobilization from littoral sediments of an inlet region in Lake Delavan, Wisconsin	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rates of P release from littoral sediments of the inlet region of Lake Delavan, Wisconsin, were examined in the laboratory under different redox and pH regimes using sediment systems and also in situ using sediment peepers. In the laboratory, rates of P release from sediments increased about two-fold (i.e., to 7 mg m(-2) d(-1)) under oxic conditions as a result of adjusting the pH of the overlying water from 8.5 to about 9.0. Laboratory rates increased to a maximum of 23 mg m(-2) d(-1) under anoxic conditions. Both in situ pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) exhibited marked seasonal fluctuations due, primarily, to metabolism by submersed macrophytes, which occupied over 50% of the inlet region. Using continuous records of in situ pH and DO and ranges in rates of P release measured in the laboratory, we estimated an overall mean rate of P release of 5.7 mg m(-2) d(-1) from the littoral sediments during the summer (April-September) of 1994. Rates of P release estimated from Fickean diffusional fluxes were similar to rates estimated from pH and DO. Our results suggest that aquatic macrophyte communities of the inlet region enhance the mobilization of P from littoral sediment by regulating pH and DO in the surrounding environment.																			0003-9136					DEC	1996	138	2					245	257																WOS:A1996VY76100008

The abundance of small eukaryotes ranged from 1,692 to 10,782 cells ml(-1). The dominant groups were the Chrysophyceae and the Chlorophyceae, which represented 19.6% and 17.9% of small eukaryotes, respectively. The results also confirmed the quantitative importance of putative parasites, Fungi and Perkinsozoa, in the small heterotrophic eukaryotic assemblage. The relative abundances recorded for the Perkinsozoa group reached as much as 31.6% of total targeted eukaryotes during the summer. The dynamics of Perkinsozoa clade 1 coincided with abundance variations in Peridinium and Ceratium spp. (Dinoflagellates), while the dynamics of Perkinsozoa clade 2 was linked to the presence of Dinobryon spp. (Chrysophyceae). Fungi, represented by chytrids, reached maximal abundance in December (569 cells ml(-1)) and were mainly correlated with the dynamics of diatoms, especially Melosira varians. A further new finding of this study is the recurrent presence of Cercozoa (6.2%) and LKM11 (4.5%) cells. This quantitative approach based on newly designed probes offers a promising means of in-depth analysis of microbial food webs in lakes, especially by revealing the phylogenetic composition of the small heterotrophic flagellate assemblage, for which an important fraction of cells are generally unidentified by classical microscopy (on average, 96.8% of the small heterotrophic flagellates were identified by the specific probes we used in this study).

Rainfall erosivity reflects soil erosion potential driven by rainfall, which is essential for soil erosive risk assessment. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall erosivity and its impacts on sediment load over the largest freshwater lake basin of China (the Poyang Lake Basin, abbreviate to PYLB). The spatiotemporal variations of rainfall erosivity from 1961 to 2014 based on 57 meteorological stations were detected using the Mann-Kendall test, linear regression, and kriging interpolation method. The sequential t test analysis of regime shift (STARS) was employed to identify the abrupt changes of sediment load, and the modified double mass curve was used to assess the impacts of rainfall erosivity variability on sediment load. It was found that there was significant increase (P<0.05) in rainfall erosivity in winter due to the significant increase in January over the last 54years, whereas no trend in year and other seasons. Annual sediment load into the Poyang Lake (PYL) decreased significantly (P<0.01) between 1961 and 2014, and the change-points were identified in both 1985 and 2003. It was found that take annual rainfall erosivity as the explanatory variables of the double mass curves is more reasonable than annual rainfall and erosive rainfall. The estimation via the modified double mass curve demonstrated that compared with the period before change-point (1961-1984), the changes of rainfall erosivity increased 8.0 and 2.1% of sediment load during 1985-2002 and 2003-2014, respectively. Human activities decreased 50.2 and 69.7% of sediment load during the last two periods, which indicated effects of human activities on sediment load change was much larger than that of rainfall erosivity variability in the PYLB.

This was less apparent In young juveniles, when allometric growth stabilised. The presence of allometry caused the diminishing of the initial differences, registered in young juveniles in early summer, for most of the traits at the end of the first year of life. Nevertheless, certain characters had strong allometric growth in this period. In the older stages, allometric growth in perch from the lake biotope contrasted the new absence of allometry in perch from the River Danube. These differences probably arise from the stronger allometric growth in subadult and adult perch in the lake biotope.

Despite previous research, there is still not enough accurate data on ecosystem response (i.e. changes in the physico-chemical variables and phytoplankton composition in shallow lakes) to the sustainable restoration based on simultaneous application of several methods The restoration of shallow urban hypertrophic Swarzcdzkie Lake started in autumn 2011. Three methods: were applied: (i) aeration of waters above the bottom sediments using a wind-driven aerator, (ii) phosphorus inactivation in water column using small doses of iron sulphate and magnesium chloride and (iii) biomanipulation with cyprinids catching and pike fry stocking. The aim of the study was to analyse the phytoplankton succession as well as physico-chemical variables of water quality in a shallow urban lake as a response to restoration measures. Samples were taken monthly from 2012 to 2014 at the deepest place of the lake, every 1m in the depth profile. Due to the restoration process, the Secchi depth increased to 1.00m. The oxygenation improved, as the anaerobic period in the deep water layer shortened to one month. The concentration of nutrients slightly decreased (mainly total nitrogen, from 5.5 to 4.0 mg N 1(-1)), especially above the bottom. These changes had an impact on phytoplankton, which decreased twofold.

Nevertheless, the observed changes were not stable yet, so the restoration process should be continued to achieve permanent improvement.

Incubation of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos in cooling water discharge and the impacts of fluctuating thermal regimes on development	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Thermal discharges released from industrial cooling water systems represent a potential environmental risk to fish species that spawn in nearshore waters. We investigated the impacts of in situ incubation of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) embryos in the vicinity of a nuclear generating station. Over 3 consecutive years, fertilized embryos were deployed in Lake Huron using custom-built incubation chambers coupled with data loggers to monitor water temperature. Temperatures at sites in the vicinity of the thermal discharge were significantly elevated compared with reference locations, with mean winter temperatures up to 3 degrees C warmer. Temperatures were also more variable at these sites, with a significantly greater daily temperature range and rate of change. Embryos developing at discharge sites were significantly larger with smaller yolks than those from the reference stations, suggesting an advanced growth. This increased growth was supported by thermal data, with discharge sites predicted to be more than 10% advanced based on growth rate modelling. These temperature changes and increase in development rate are below thresholds for embryonic mortality but could potentially impact posthatch larval survival.

Kinetic analyses of whole lake water on three dates demonstrated that the maximal rate (V(max)) for phosphate uptake was highest (5.2 nM min-1) in spring. On all dates, size fractionation of plankton and kinetic analyses of uptake indicated that most (>50%) uptake of phosphate was by phytoplankton at V(max) and by bacteria at ambient concentrations. Isotope dilution assays, with either unlabeled phosphate or various dissolved organic P (DOP) compounds, demonstrated that phosphate was the preferred substrate for uptake into both algae and bacteria. Phytoplankton had greater capacity for uptake of P from both phosphate and DOP than bacterioplankton. We concluded that phytoplankton use both phosphate and DOP, particularly at high substrate concentrations, and that bacterial utilization of P may be limited by the availability of organic C or other nutrients.

Rock magnetic investigations revealed changes of the magnetic mineralogy along the hemi-pelagic sedimentary sequence but the reconstruction of past direction and relative paleointensity variations of the geomagnetic field remained feasible. Four successive paleointensity drops are recorded between 30 and 50 ka BP. The largest one is associated with an abrupt swing of declination and inclination interpreted as a smoothed signature of the Laschamp excursion (similar to 41 ka BP). The Succession of four events of weak intensity between 30 and 50 ka BP introduces a complex behaviour of the geomagnetic field in the time interval spanning over the Laschamp and the Mono Lake excursions.

We analyse the temporal (TC) and spatial (SC) coherence of floods in 554 catchments over Great Britain. TC was assessed using the dispersion-index and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson regression, with both methods applied to aggregation windows of 1-5 years. SC was investigated using the flood susceptibility index. Results show that i) most of the UK peak floods are overdispersed and ii) a positive relationship exists between winter mean North Atlantic Oscillation anomalies and the annual number of peak floods across western Britain. The susceptibility to widespread floods is higher for the southeast parts of Britain and for the Clyde-Forth valleys, and it increases with catchment permeability and with the influence of lakes/reservoirs. These findings are relevant to enhance existing flood hazard estimation methods and, in turn, will lead to more realistic flood risk quantification.

Horseshoe Island is situated in Marguerite Bay, in the western Antarctic Peninsula. In this research, we purpose to determine the limnological characteristics of four lakes on Horseshoe Island (Col 1, Col 2, Skua and Zano). Water samples were taken once (during the summer period) from one station in each of the lakes for chemical analysis. The Trophic State Index (TSI) was calculated based on Secchi depth, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus concentrations. Phytoplankton were sampled from the same stations, except for Lake Zano, because of the ice cover. Phytoplankton community indice (Q) was calculated. Total phosphorus concentration for Lake Col 1, Col 2, Skua and Zano were measured as 0.6, 0.65, 3.0, 4.6 mg/m3, respectively. Based on total phosphorus, these four lentic systems are oligotrophic. TSI values pointed out oligotrophy and mesotrophy in the lakes. Lake Skua was found to be excellent quality (0.59 mg/l) while Lake Col 1 (0.72 mg/l) and Lake Col 2 (0.68 mg/l) were found to be good quality according to total phytoplankton biomass. The ecological status of the lakes is prediction to be of medium quality based on cyanobacteria biomass. This may be due to the rapid increase of Cyanobacteria in the short summer period as well as nutrient enrichment. Based on the Q indice, Lake Skua (4.2) is of excellent quality, Lake Col 2 (4) is of good quality, and Lake Col 1 (2.73) is of moderate quality in ice-free period. Because these lakes are under stressors such as climatic pressure (duration of ice cover) and natural eutrophication processes, regular monitoring of the lakes on the Antarctic continent is recommended					GULLUCE, Medine/AAX-5429-2021; Demir, Nilsun/H-7762-2012	, Gokce/0000-0003-2044-9609													1303-2712	2149-181X				DEC	2024	24			I					TRJFAS27099	10.4194/TRJFAS27099	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/TRJFAS27099													WOS:001421265600003

Here, we present a new sedimentary record covering the past similar to 8,000 years from Lago di Baratz, north-west Sardinia. Vegetation and fire history are reconstructed by pollen, spores, macrofossils and charcoal analyses and environmental dynamics by high-resolution element geochemistry together with pigment analyses. During the period 8,100-7,500 cal bp, when seasonality was high and fire and erosion were frequent, Erica arborea and E. scoparia woodlands dominated the coastal landscape. Subsequently, between 7,500 and 5,500 cal bp, seasonality gradually declined and thermo-mediterranean woodlands with Pistacia and Quercus ilex partially replaced Erica communities under diminished incidence of fire. After 5,500 cal bp, evergreen oak forests expanded markedly, erosion declined and lake levels increased, likely in response to increasing (summer) moisture availability. Increased anthropogenic fire disturbance triggered shrubland expansions (e.g. Tamarix and Pistacia) around 5,000-4,500 cal bp. Subsequently around 4,000-3,500 cal bp evergreen oak-olive forests expanded massively when fire activity declined and lake productivity and anoxia reached Holocene maxima. Land-use activities during the past 4,000 years (since the Bronze Age) gradually disrupted coastal forests, but relict stands persisted under rather stable environmental conditions until ca. 200 cal bp, when agricultural activities intensified and Pinus and Eucalyptus were planted to stabilize the sand dunes. Pervasive prehistoric land-use activities since at least the Bronze Age Nuraghi period included the cultivation of Prunus, Olea europaea and Juglans regia after 3,500-3,300 cal bp, and Quercus suber after 2,500 cal bp. We conclude that restoring less flammable native Q. ilex and O. europaea forest communities would markedly reduce fire risk and erodibility compared to recent forest plantations with flammable non-native trees (e.g. Pinus, Eucalyptus) and xerophytic shrubland (e.g. Cistus, Erica).

A multi-metric index was developed and used to examine the interconnectivity between aquatic, biotic environment, shore and riparian areas along Lake Siutghiol in Constanta, Romania. The shoreline development index was developed as part of an International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project funded by the US National Science Foundation, and applied first in summer of 2008, for Tabacarie Lake and in the summer of 2011 for Siutghiol Lake. Both lakes are located in urbanized landscapes in the vicinity of Mamaia seaside resort and are heavily used for recreational and leisure activites leading to drastic anthropogenic impacts on the shorelines. Aquatic, riparian and shore variables were observed along the shoreline by using a modified transect methodology. Metrics related to vegetation, waste, organic debris, soil cover and land use were observed at each station around the lake. Biotic components were evaluated by observing wildlife at each station. Landuse and landscape aspects were characterized using a qualitative assessment of the quality of "natural" space, "cultural" areas and "built" environments (e. g. parking lots, damaged buildings or shopping areas) located along the shore. The data collected were processed in a scale point, and given a score for 147 transects around Siutghiol Lake. Together with the shoreline development index we performed analyses for water quality at different points around the lake/functional zones in order to correlate water chemistry with the other shoreline metrics. These scores obtained by applying this methodology serve as integrative indicators of environmental health and human activities for this complex human-environmental system. They can also help to monitor the progress toward sustainable development around Siutghiol Lake.					; Tofan, Lucica/GYJ-5147-2022	Tofan, Lucica/0000-0002-3589-496X; 													1314-2704						2012							67	74																WOS:000348536400010

Influence of subhumid climate and water table depth on groundwater recharge in shallow outwash aquifers	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Hypothetical one-dimensional models of unsaturated flow were used to estimate the probability of groundwater recharge to shallow, glacial outwash aquifers. Simulations were supported by field data, previous three-dimensional modeling, and cross-sectional models of water table response to precipitation events for a research area in northern Alberta, Canada. Groundwater recharge rates were found to depend on the year-to-year climate variation, the depth to the water table, and were largely driven by annual snowmelt. Simulations indicate that in summer months, when transpiration and canopy interception were considered explicitly, groundwater recharge was negligible. For water table depths less than 6 m below ground surface, the occurrence of recharge depends on climatic conditions (water deficit or surplus) of the current and previous year, and can vary from 0 to 266 mm yr(-1). For water table depths of 6 m or more, recharge will depend on climate conditions from the most recent decade, have less annual variability, and a mean annual rate of approximately 45 mm yr(-1).					; Smerdon, Brian/C-5422-2011	Mendoza, Carl/0000-0002-2731-0004; 													0043-1397					AUG 22	2008	44	8							W08427	10.1029/2007WR005950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR005950													WOS:000258651700001

Evaluation of Empirical Statistical Downscaling Models' Skill in Predicting Tanzanian Rainfall and Their Application in Providing Future Downscaled Scenarios	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Projections of three important seasonal rainfall parameters-total precipitation (p(t)), wet-day mean (mu(w)) and wet-day frequency (f(w))-considered to be relevant to crop agriculture were performed. Links between large-scale climate variables and local precipitation in Tanzania were investigated during the March-May (MAM), October-December (OND), and December-April (DJFMA) rainfall seasons. Variables found to have strong links were used to downscale the local precipitation for three future periods; near term, midcentury, and end of century. Downscaling models for p(t), mu(w), and f(w) were calibrated using observed large-scale seasonal rainfall and projected downscaled parameters were obtained based on rainfall simulations from ensembles of GCMs. The models' skill scores were found to be sensitive to the domain size and number of leading EOFs used. The common EOF method employed in the downscaling modulated the skills depending on the GCMs used. The spread in the rainfall projections was found to be larger in OND and moderate in MAM and DJFMA. The multimodel mean projections in response to two RCPs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) suggest a shift toward wetter (drier) conditions (p(t)) for OND (DJFMA) for all three periods. There is no uniform projection for MAM; some stations are projected to feature wetter and some drier conditions. In the midcentury and end of century, there is an increase of precipitation to about 40% for some areas getting OND rainfall and a decrease of precipitation up to about 10% for some areas getting MAM or DJFMA rainfall. Generally, the magnitude of change strongly differs across the areas.

Utilization of reserves can be related to maintenance during periods of reduced food supply, to reproduction, particularly during periods of poor food availability, and to migration. Published data on the seasonal cycles of reserves and reproduction in Sebastes suggest that reserves are important for maintenance during wintertime periods of low food availability. Unlike many other ectothermic vertebrates, some species of Sebastes deposit fat reserves at the same time as gametogenesis, a pattern consistent with the longevity and iteroparity evident in the genus. Other species of Sebastes have similar seasonal timing of fat cycles, but since reproduction takes place later in the year, the decline in reserves during winter coincides with the main period of reproductive activity. The significance of this is not clear. Interspecific differences in amounts of reserves may be related to geographical differences in the seasonality or abundance of food. Intraspecific variation in reserves, marked most strongly by allometry of reserves with regard to fish length, bears further study, since it may link the proces of sexual maturation and the responses of repeat spawners to variability in food supply and other environmental factors.																			0378-1909					JAN	1991	30	1-2					57	70		10.1007/BF02296877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02296877													WOS:A1991EU35500008

A comprehensive review on emerging trends in industrial wastewater research	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY												Rapid industrialization is one of the intricate factors that is linked to the depletion of water resources and increased generation of wastewater. Due to various obstructions and impediments, such as ineffective treatment solutions, exorbitant prices, lack of basic amenities, insufficient financial assistance, and technical expertise, sustainable treatment of industrial effluents has become an onerous process in most parts of the world. The majority of current treatment solutions are conventional and outdated, and thus fall short to remove all the contaminants efficiently from the industrial wastewater. Moreover, poorly treated or untreated industrial effluents are indiscriminately dumped into water bodies such as lakes, ponds, and rivers, causing substantial health hazards to humans and animals and serious threats to the aquatic ecosystem. Thus, there is a need for highly efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable technologies for the treatment of industrial wastewater. Employment of microbial technologies such as microbial fuel cells and microalgal technologies, treatment of wastewater can be coupled with the production of bioelectricity and valuable biomass, respectively. Moreover, with nanofiltration and biochar technologies, the efficiency of the overall treatment procedure can be increased to a greater extent. The present review aims to highlight opportunities and challenges associated with some of the emerging trends in industrial wastewater research.

Patterns of spatial and temporal variability of UV transparency in Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake Tahoe is an ultra-oligotrophic subalpine lake that is renowned for its clarity. The region experiences little cloud cover and is one of the most UV transparent lakes in the world. As such, it is an ideal environment to study the role of UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems. Long-term trends in Secchi depths showed that water transparency to visible light has decreased in recent decades, but limited data are available on the UV transparency of the lake. Here we examine how ultraviolet radiation varies relative to longer-wavelength photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm, visible wavelengths) horizontally along inshore-offshore transects in the lake and vertically within the water column as well as temporally throughout 2007. UV transparency was more variable than PAR transparency horizontally across the lake and throughout the year. Seasonal patterns of Secchi transparency differed from both UV and PAR, indicating that different substances may be responsible for controlling transparency to UV, PAR, and Secchi. In surface waters, UVA (380 nm) often attenuated more slowly than PAR, a pattern visible in only exceptionally transparent waters with very low dissolved organic carbon. On many sampling dates, UV transparency decreased progressively with depth suggesting surface photobleaching, reductions in particulate matter, increasing chlorophyll a, or some combination of these increased during summer months. Combining these patterns of UV transparency with data on visible light provides a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure, function, and effects of environmental change in highly transparent alpine and subalpine lakes such as Tahoe.

This study attempts to calculate the groundwater discharge in a lake using a simple water balance model, water level measurements, aerial photographs and GIS technologies. In particular, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) for the lake has been developed, which in combination with GIS (Geographical Information System) software and water level fluctuations has provided the lake's monthly water storages. Additional hydrologic elements, including land and water uses, overland flow and evapotranspiration, have been estimated and incorporated in a water balance model which after extensive analysis have provided credible monthly values for the groundwater recharge in Lake Trichonis. This particular methodology can be widely applied in catchments with similar hydrologic regimes and can provide reliable, cost-efficient estimations of groundwater recharges into water bodies.

A comparison of 4 isolates each of Cenococcum geophilum and Lacccaria laccata revealed striking infraspecific differences in response to pH. Species also differed in their effect on pH of the medium over the duration of the experiment. Isolates that grew best in vitro at high pH levels did not originate from high pH soils.

Estimation of gas exchange coefficients from observations on the Yenisei River, Russia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The gas exchange between water bodies and air is difficult to measure, thus the approximations of air-water gas exchange coefficient based solely on wind speed has been widely used. However, such approaches may not work well in river environments. In rivers, water currents may govern gas exchange. Thus, a new approximation for calculating the gas exchange coefficient (k) based on the near-surface velocity scale (u(s)) is suggested and compared to wind-based estimates. Our velocity scale estimates are based on field observations during summer 2016 on the Yenisei River using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, high-frequency temperature profilers and a vessel-mounted meteorological sensors-suite. The results demonstrate that u(s)-derived gas exchange coefficients are higher than those based solely on wind speed. The results demonstrate that the wind approximation underestimates gas exchange coefficients during low-wind conditions.

Temporal Variability in Reservoir Surface Area Is an Important Source of Uncertainty in GHG Emission Estimates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Ebullitive methane (CH4) emissions in lentic ecosystems tend to concentrate at river-lake interfaces and within shallow littoral zones. However, inconsistent definitions of the littoral zone and static representations of the lake or reservoir surface area contribute to major uncertainties in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates, particularly in reservoirs with large water-level fluctuations. This study examines temporal variation in littoral and total surface areas of US reservoirs and demonstrates how different methods and data sources lead to discrepencies in reservoir GHG emissions at large scales and over time. We also explore variability in remotely sensed water occurrence according to maximum surface area, reservoir purposes, and hydrologic regions. Notably, the largest relative variability in surface area is exhibited by small reservoirs with a maximum surface area <1 km(2) and non-hydroelectric reservoirs. Additionally, we use a case study of measured CH4 emissions from the southeastern United States (Douglas Reservoir) to illustrate the effects of varying surface area on reservoir-wide GHG estimates. Upscaled CH4 emissions in Douglas Reservoir differed by nearly two-fold depending on the source of total surface area data and whether estimates accounted for seasonal fluctuations in surface area. During seasonal drawdown in Douglas Reservoir, relative littoral area varies non-linearly; periods of lower pool elevation (and thus larger relative littoral area) likely contribute disproportionately high CH4 emission rates compared to the commonly sampled summer season when water levels are at full-pool elevation. Improved GHG monitoring and upscaling techniques require accounting for temporal variability in reservoir surface extent and littoral area.					; Matson, Paul/AAB-9767-2019; Griffiths, Natalie/C-3087-2012; Jager, Henriette/OGQ-5439-2025; Hansen, Carly/AAW-5192-2021	Hansen, Carly/0000-0001-9328-0838; Griffiths, Natalie/0000-0003-0068-7714; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2025	61	1							e2024WR037726	10.1029/2024WR037726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037726													WOS:001389949000001

Birds inhabiting wetlands are exposed to pollutants. In this study, a method for exposure risk assessment of migratory herbivorous birds and identification of priority pollutants/areas was developed and employed in East Dongting Lake wetland (EDT). Four heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd) in sedge and soil samples from ten lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) habitats in EDT were investigated. Results showed that negative effect of Cr and Pb on lesser white-fronted goose may occur while the concentrations of Cu and Cd are considered to be relatively safe. Prioritize threats were decreased in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd. Cr and Pb were considered to be the priority pollutants. Spatial interpolation based on geostatistical methods showed that Spring Breeze Lake should draw much attention. Furthermore, regions with high hazard index were identified to be priority areas of EDT for risk management.

Lough Derg has the most downstream population of three lakes in the Shannon catchment. We report on the occurrence of recently hatched larvae from a river section captured above Lough Derg during March 2011. This is the first indication of a downstream movement of larval pollan to a lake, which could have important implications for conservation of this red-listed teleost. This finding is consistent with earlier reports of adult pollan, in spawning condition, captured in fyke nets upstream of Lough Derg. There are also accounts of pollan spawning in the river section below Lough Derg during the 1960s, when they were once common.

Here, the integration of multi-archive flood series from the Hasli-Aare, Lutschine, Kander, Simme, Lombach, and Eistlenbach catchments in the Bernese Alps constitutes a unique approach to the reconstruction of flooding events over the last six centuries and to the development of a temporal-spatial model of past flood behavior. Different types of flood archive, be they of natural or anthropogenic origin, record different processes and legacies of these physical phenomena. In this study, paleoflood records obtained from floodplains (four flood series) and lake sediments (four series), together with documentary data (six series), were analyzed and compared with instrumental measurements (four series) and the profiles of lichenometric-dated flood heights (four series) to i) determine common flood pulses, ii) identify events that are out-of-phase, iii) investigate the sensitivity of the different natural archives to flood drivers and forcing, iv) locate past flooding in an alpine region of 2117 km(2), and v) simulate atmospheric modes of climate variability during flood-rich periods from 1400 to 2005 CE. Asynchronous flood response across the sites is attributed to differences in their local hydrologic regimes, influenced by (i) their physiographic parameters, including size, altitude, storage capacity and connectivity of basins, and (ii) their climate parameters, including type, spatial distribution, duration, and intensity of precipitation. The most accurate, continuous series, corresponding to the period from 1400 to 2005 CE, were integrated into a synthetic flood master curve that defines ten dominant flood pulses. Six of these correspond to cooler climate pulses (around 1480, 1570, 1760, 1830, 1850 and 1870 CE), three to intermediate temperatures (around 1410, 1650 and 1710 CE), while the most recent corresponds to the current pulse of Global Warming (2005 CE). Furthermore, five coincide with the positive mode of the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation, characterized by a strong blocking anticyclone between the Scandinavia Peninsula and Great Britain. For two of the most catastrophic flood events in the Bernese Alps (those of 1762 and 1831 CE), the location and magnitude of all the flood records compiled were plotted to provide an accurate mapping of the spatial pattern of flooding. This was then compared to the pattern of atmospheric variability. The comprehensive 4-D picture of paleofloods thus achieved should facilitate an in-depth understanding of the floods and flood forcing in mountain catchments.					; Carvalho, Filipe/AAA-6854-2019; Wilhelm, Bruno/B-9265-2013; Peña, Juan/Y-5376-2019; Gómez Bolea, Antonio/HKW-4303-2023; Ferreira Carvalho, Filipe/F-4743-2016	Wirth, Stefanie B./0000-0002-1276-8506; Amann, Benjamin/0000-0002-0101-0433; Pena, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8784-6142; Schulte, Lothar/0000-0001-5829-3166; Ferreira Carvalho, Filipe/0000-0002-8152-0467													0921-8181	1872-6364				SEP	2019	180						66	88		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.05.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.05.011													WOS:000478709700005

This study applies a comprehensive multimedia regional pesticide fate and chemical transport modeling system that we developed to investigate the atmospheric transport and deposition of toxaphene to the Great Lakes. Simulated results predict a significant amount of toxaphene (similar to 350 kg) being transported through the atmosphere and deposited into the Great Lakes in the simulation year. Results also show that U.S. residues and global background are major sources to toxaphene deposition into the Great Lakes and atmospheric concentrations in the region. While the U.S. residues are the dominant source in warm months, the background dominates during winter months. In addition, different sources have different influences on the individual Great Lakes due to their proximity and relative geographical positions to the sources; U.S. residues are the dominant source to Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Michigan, but they are a much less important source to Lake Superior. These results shed light on the mystery that observed toxaphene concentrations in Great Lakes' lake trout and smelt declined between 1982 and 1992 in four of the Great Lakes except Lake Superior. While monthly total depositions to Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Michigan have clear seasonal variability with much greater values in April, May, and June, monthly total depositions to Lake Superior are more uniformly distributed over the year with comparatively greater levels in cold months.

Recharge of a subglacial lake by surface meltwater in northeast Greenland	NATURE												In a warming climate, surface meltwater production on large ice sheets is expected to increase. If this water is delivered to the ice sheet base it may have important consequences for ice dynamics. For example, basal water distributed in a diffuse network can decrease basal friction(1,2) and accelerate ice flow(3-8), whereas channelized basal water can move quickly to the ice margin, where it can alter fjord circulation and submarine melt rates(9,10). Less certain is whether surface meltwater can be trapped and stored in subglacial lakes beneath large ice sheets. Here we show that a subglacial lake in Greenland drained quickly, as seen in the collapse of the ice surface, and then refilled from surface meltwater input. We use digital elevation models from stereo satellite imagery and airborne measurements to resolve elevation changes during the evolution of the surface and basal hydrologic systems at the Flade Isblink ice cap in northeast Greenland. During the autumn of 2011, a collapse basin about 70 metres deep and about 0.4 cubic kilometres in volume formed near the southern summit of the ice cap as a subglacial lake drained into a nearby fjord. Over the next two years, rapid uplift of the floor of the basin (which is approximately 8.4 square kilometres in area) occurred as surface meltwater flowed into crevasses around the basin margin and refilled the subglacial lake. Our observations show that surface meltwater can be trapped and stored at the bed of an ice sheet. Sensible and latent heat released by this trapped meltwater could soften nearby colder basal ice(11) and alter downstream ice dynamics(12,13). Heat transport associated with meltwater trapped in subglacial lakes should be considered when predicting how ice sheet behaviour will change in a warming climate.																			0028-0836	1476-4687				FEB 12	2015	518	7538					223	U165		10.1038/nature14116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14116								25607355					WOS:000349190300036

Land-water meteorology driven build-up of precursor pollutants (NOX and VOC) from mobile and stationary sources undergo photochemical O3 production and result in seasonal high O3 episodes during the spring and summertime. Routine and specialized surface measurements coupled with airborne and remotely sensed measurements from the 2017 Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS) provide an opportunity to evaluate photochemical grid model representation of these processes. The Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) was applied at a 4-km grid resolution for the Lake Michigan region and compared against routine and field study measurements to determine how well the modeling system captures emissions, meteorology, and chemical production during O3 episodes. The model captured day to day and diurnal variability in observed O3 along Lake Michigan but often missed peak O3. Surface level NO2 was generally well characterized, but the model seemed to be missing a significant source of VOC, likely both regional and local (not necessarily the same source sector) based on model sensitivities. On June 2, 2017, the model captured the timing of the lake to land breeze but underestimated nearsurface wind speed which coincided with peak O3. The underestimation of surface O3 north of Chicago at Zion, Illinois, on this afternoon may be related to over-water vertical mixing, the modeled lake breeze being too weak to transport ozone and precursors back onshore, regional and aloft underprediction of O3, or some combination of each of these factors. Despite underpredictions of peak O3 at some monitors on certain days, the modeling system is useful for developing control scenarios for this region. Model-predicted O3 sensitivity to precursors matched other assessments and suggests both NOX and VOC anthropogenic emissions are important to reduce O3 in the Chicago area.

Distribution functions of the ice freeboard changed considerably depending on ice concentrations in contrast with the decreasing function for the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The mean ice freeboard, however, correlated very well with the ice concentration, which is very important for estimating total ice amounts in regions of drifting ice.

In the brackish waters a mixture of common freshwater species and marine species was found with 13 species exclusively occurring in brackish waters. Lowest ciliate cell numbers were observed for deep freshwater lakes, highest cell numbers were determined for brackish waters. Highest species richness was found in artificial peat ponds with an average of 24 pelagic ciliate species in spring samples. The range of occurrence for the identified species was wide for most common species. However, the influence of some environmental factors could be enlightened.

Here, we present a robust, routinely usable approach to identify viruses from two freshwater lakes of the lower Great Lakes region, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie. We collected water samples from six different beaches of these two lakes during the summer period of 2012 and 2013, and separated into three distinct fractions, namely a bacterial fraction, a virus like particle (VLP) fraction, and a fraction of eDNA (environmental DNA). DNA extracted from all three fractions was sequenced and bioinformatic analyses of sequences revealed the presence of viruses from major viral families. The analyzed viral sequences were dominated by bacteriophage sequences, but also contained many plant and animal viruses. Within the context of this study, geographic location does not appear to have a major impact on viral abundance and diversity, since virome composition of both lakes were similar. Comparative analyses between eDNA and viral fractions showed that eDNA can be used in combination with VLP fractions to identify viruses from the environment.

The data were used to characterize the variability in basic meteorological variables (air temperature and humidity, water surface temperature, and wind velocity) and in evaporation rates. Analysis of the data on an hourly basis reveals the combined effect of local physical processes occurring during airflow over water surfaces and the diurnal regional phenomena of the inland penetration of the Mediterranean sea breeze downslope into the area during the afternoon hours. The resulting strong, hot and dry westerly winds at the western coast become weaker, cooler, and more humid as they reach the eastern shore after a delay of 1-2 h. Consequently, the maximum evaporation rate at Sapir was occasionally twice the corresponding rate at fin Gev. The data on a daily basis depicted the influence of synoptic systems on the regional climate. Commonly, the mean evaporation rate from the entire lake is assumed to be equal to that evaluated at a specific site. Considering the observed variability, this assumption might lead to errors as large as 100% on the daily basis and of 15% on the seasonal basis.																			0894-8763					JUL	1996	35	7					1076	1084		10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1076:SATVIM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1076:SATVIM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1996UV29500005

Sarcodine protozoa were of little significance, the plankton was dominated by ciliates and flagellates. Ciliate density peaked in late May to early June with densities reaching 9.2 .times. 103 l-1. There was considerable variation in spatial distribution and greatest species diversity occurred in March/April. After the establishment of summer stratification the planktonic ciliates were confined to water of >25% oxygen saturation in the water column. Oligotrichs, particularly the genus Strombidium and tintinnids, and peritrichs dominated the ciliate assemblages. There was no correlation between chlorophyll .alpha. concentrations and ciliate numbers, but a correlation was apparent between ciliate numbers and flagellate density.

Therefore, habitat separation is assumed to be the main mechanism to reduce interspecific competition in these two cooccurring species of eels.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				JUN	2005	39	4					931	939		10.1080/00288330.2005.9517363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2005.9517363													WOS:000230698300011

Where Lakes Were Once Rivers: Contrasts of Freshwater Turtle Diets in Dams and Rivers of Southeastern Queensland	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												We contrasted diets of three turtles (Elseya albagula, Myuchelys latisternum, Emydura krefftii) from free-flowing or impounded rivers in southeastern Queensland, Australia, to evaluate the effects of flow regulation. The turtle species encompassed the herbivorous, carnivorous, and omnivorous feeding guilds, respectively. The study design simultaneously considered ontogenetic dietary shifts and seasonal effects on prey availability. Relative to the river samples, diets for three turtles in impoundments were substantially reduced in prey abundance, species richness, and dietary breadth. Turtles with narrower dietary preferences in free-flowing rivers were more affected by dams than was the dietary generalist. For the most omnivorous turtle, qualitative differences were evident in diets from impoundments and rivers; yet considering its greater dietary breadth, quantitative effects on diet were minor. Diets of turtles in impoundments included fewer subaquatic plants and wind fallen fruits than did the diets of turtles in rivers. For the largely carnivorous turtle, fewer aquatic invertebrates were ingested in impoundments than in riverine habitats, and scavenging behavior was noted mainly in impoundments. Multidimensional scaling of the site characteristics identified dams or weirs with back-ups exceeding 20 km as being relatively similar in impacts on prey diversity. Canonical correspondence analysis identified factors of habitat alteration and turtle size as major determinants of underlying variance in the diets. The results suggest that turtle food webs are altered by river regulation. A general finding that turtle diets in impoundments were depleted of aquatic plants or macro-invertebrates pertains to other turtles of conservation importance.

A millennial perspective on Arctic warming from 14C in quartz and plants emerging from beneath ice caps	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Observational records show that the area of ice caps on northern Baffin Island, Arctic Canada has diminished by more than 50% since 1958. Fifty C-14 dates on dead vegetation emerging beneath receding ice margins document the persistence of some of these ice caps since at least 350 AD. In situ cosmogenic C-14 in rock surfaces, and C-14 in plant macrofossils from lake-sediment cores demonstrate that the plateau remained ice-free through the middle Holocene, but has supported ice caps for more than 2000 of the past 2800 years. The rapid disappearance of these ice caps over the past century, despite decreasing summer insolation, further demonstrates the unusual character of 20th Century warmth. Widespread ice-cap expansion similar to 1280 AD early in the Little Ice Age, and intensified expansion similar to 1450 AD, coincide with peak stratospheric volcanic aerosol loading and reduced solar luminosity, suggesting that these mechanisms may have initiated ice-cap growth, subsequently maintained by strong positive feedbacks.					briner, jason/JDM-4641-2023; Lifton, Nathaniel/M-2017-2015	Lifton, Nathaniel/0000-0002-6976-3298													0094-8276	1944-8007				JAN 11	2008	35	1							L01502	10.1029/2007GL032057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032057													WOS:000252362000003

Quantitative estimations of algal standing crop were made by culturing samples from water and sediment on nutrient agar plates. Different patterns of distribution and periodicity were exhibited by the algal species. C. vulgaris var. vulgaris was most widespread and present in large numbers in both algal communities at all 4 study sites. C. moewusii var. eumetabletos was common. All microgreen algae exhibited rapid increases in standing crop, but these were irregular. Minimum numbers were recorded during winter. Some species, such as A. falcatus and C. neglectum were of limited distribution. Ordination analyses by reciprocal averaging confirmed differences between the growth of microgreen algae within sites and between lakes. The standing crops of microgreen algae were greater in Llyn Padarn the lower lake, and changes in these algae were greater in the plankton at the inflow than the outflow site of the lower lake. On the sediments, there was more change in the microgreen algae at the outflow site in Llyn Padarn than at the inflow site in Llyn Peris.																			0007-1617						1979	14	4					361	375		10.1080/00071617900650411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071617900650411													WOS:A1979JC01700008

Exposure of adults to water below pH 5.0 during pulses of acid snowmelt, or of juveniles to below pH 5.5 through gradual lake acidification, could result in population decline. Hyalella azteca from moderately acidic Ontaria [Canada] lakes (pH 5.6-5.7) survived longer at lethal pH than did amphipods from circumneutral lake (pH 6.4-7.2) where spring pH depressions do not occur. Resistance and tolerance to low pH was neither readily lost by tolerant amphipods exposed to neutral water for 10 d nor readily gained by nontolerant amphipods exposed to sublethal low pH for a similar duration. This absence of physiological plasticity of individual H. azteca suggests that population differences in acid tolerance may result from processes of selective mortality with or without a genetic basis.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1987	44	6					1102	1111		10.1139/f87-133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-133													WOS:A1987J496900001
J	Janssen, J; Luebke, MA				Janssen, J; Luebke, MA			Preference for rocky habitat by age-0 yellow perch and alewives	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We determined the preference for rocky versus sandy bottom of age-0 alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and newly demersal age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The catch rate of both species in gill nets at rocky sites was approximately four times greater than at sand sites along the Wisconsin shoreline during mid-August through mid-September 2002. For yellow perch the preference for rocky habitat was probably related to shelter and food; diet analysis showed that young perch from rocky habitat primarily consumed amphipods and isopods, prey associated with rocks. The reasons why alewives associate with rocky habitat are not obvious, but may be related to feeding on emerging insects. These results indicate that a preference for rocky habitat by yellow perch, noted earlier for larger and/or reproductive individuals, begins during their first summer. The results also indicate that assessments Of age-0 yellow perch and alewife that sample only soft substrates may seriously underestimate abundance.																			0380-1330						2004	30	1					93	99		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70332-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70332-9													WOS:000220858500009

Morphological Comparison of the Chesapeake Logperch Percina bimaculata with the Logperch Percina c. caprodes and Percina c. semifasciata in Pennsylvania	FISHES												The Chesapeake logperch, Percina bimaculata (Halderman) has a disjunct distribution when compared to other species in the subgenus Percina. Members of this subgenus in Pennsylvania include Percina caprodes caprodes (Rafinesque), Percina caprodes semifasciata (DeKay), and P. bimaculata. Historically the Chesapeake logperch was known only from the Susquehanna River and Potomac River basins. Its range is now restricted to the Susquehanna River below Holtwood Dam and upper Chesapeake Bay. It has been extirpated from the Potomac River and the type locality near Columbia, PA. Attempts are being made to reintroduce it into tributaries of the Susquehanna River near Columbia, PA. We postulate that P. bimaculata diverged from a population of Percina caprodes semifasciata. A naked nape and the fact that both of these species do not occur above the fall line in Pennsylvania support such a relationship.

A total of 77 healthy subjects (43 males, 34 females) were exposed to a simulated altitude of 4500 m for 12 hours. Peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and Lake Louise AMS scores were recorded before and during (30 minutes, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours) hypoxic exposure. Blood pressure dips were observed at 3-hour mark. However, systolic blood pressure fell more pronounced from baseline during the initial 30 minutes in normobaric hypoxia (-17.5 vs. -11.0 mmHg, p = 0.01) in subjects suffering from AMS (AMS(+); n = 56) than in those remaining unaffected from AMS (AMS(-); n = 21); values did not differ between groups over the subsequent time course. Our data may suggest a transient autonomic dysfunction resulting in a more pronounced blood pressure drop during initial hypoxic exposure in AMS(+) compared with AMS(-) subjects.

J	Jin, G; Li, Z; Xie, P				Jin, G; Li, Z; Xie, P			The growth patterns of juvenile and precocious Chinese mitten crabs, Eriocheir sinensis (Decapoda, Grapsidae), stocked in freshwater lakes of China	CRUSTACEANA												Stocking experiments with Eriocheir sinensis were conducted in two small, shallow lakes to study its growth pattern in 1994-1997. For the initially immature crabs, carapace width (CW) increases from 21.2 +/- 0.4 mm (mean +/- s.e.) for females and 22.3 +/- 0.5 mm for males in January, to 65.4 +/- 0.5 mm for females and 66.9 +/- 0.6 mm for males in October. There is no significant difference in CW and carapace length (CL), although there is a large difference in body weight (BW) between sexes in every month from January to August when crabs are juvenile, however, there are significant differences in CW, CL. and BW between sexes after September when the crabs become sexually mature. The growth curve from January to October fits a logistic equation and may be expressed as CW = 75.7 (1 + exp (0.914 - 0.011t))(-1) for females, and CW = 77.5 (1 + exp (0.889 - 0.011t))-1 for males, where CW is in mm, t in days. For precocious crabs (reaching maturity by the first autumn, CW does not change much from January to July, which indicates that precocious crabs stop growing. Like juveniles, the precocious crabs show no differences in CW and CL, but do show a statistically significant difference in BW between sexes.

This includes a shift in nesting sites and an expansion of nesting to anthropogenic habitat. Using a 50-year record of monitoring data (1970-2020), we assessed factors influencing nesting ecology (number of nests, nest morphology, success rate, and habitat use) from a total of 3,013 nests recorded across South Florida. We detected a change in nesting success rate, increasing from 61% in the 1970's to near 90% since 2010. Our hot spot analysis illustrates that nesting sites in northeastern Florida Bay and Flamingo/Cape Sable (Everglades National Park) were important for American crocodiles. Anthropogenic habitats, such as canals provided vital habitat nesting in areas such as Flamingo/Cape Sable (Everglades National Park), Turkey Point Power Plant, and Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge for the current Florida population. Environmental parameters suspected to affect nesting success have shown an increasing trend over the past 50 years and minimum temperature and rainfall, during the summer season, are correlated with increased nesting success and temporal variation across South Florida. The adaptive capacity that American crocodiles exhibited in Florida gave the species advantages to face changes in climate and landscape over the last 50 years, however, it does not imply that the adaptive capacity of the species to face these changes (evolutionary potential) cannot reach a limit if changes continue. Here, we document C. acutus nesting ecology population responses to ecosystem restoration efforts in Florida; and further demonstrate the value of protecting and restoring habitat to support recovery of listed species.

Frequent sampling is needed to determine how species distributions change in response to climatic and environmental changes. Twenty-two of the 65 Quebec species were collected in the present study. One new species for Quebec was collected (Prosimulium magnum complex), and new distribution areas were found for some species. Exhaustive sampling clearly showed time- and space-related distribution variations of the univoltine and polyvoltine species. Seasonal appearance of species was synchronized at the two sites studied, but generation number was smaller at Lac du Barrage than at Lac Souris. The species-colonizing process seems to be environmentally determined stream-width and substrate-type influenced, as Simulium annulus, S. jenningsi. S. pictipes, and S. innoxium, were found in high-current-velocity falls. Artificial site colonization by S. aureum in a pen-urban environment had not been observed among simuliids prior to this study, in contrast to many mosquito species.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2011	18	2					127	148																WOS:000302829600001
J	Hill, B; Dove, A				Hill, Brad; Dove, Alice			Concentrations and loads of nutrients and major ions in the Niagara River, 1975-2018	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Environment and Climate Change Canada has monitored Niagara River water quality in support of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement since establishing a fixed site at Niagara-on-the-Lake in 1975. Using over 40 years of data from this site along with the Fort Erie location added in 1983, we examine the status and trends of concentrations and loadings of nutrients and major ions and assess evidence of sources between the two stations. Trends were observed for the majority of measured parameters and there is strong agreement between trends in concentrations and loadings which are generally higher at the downstream site; however, upstream/downstream differences indicate relatively little loading occurs along the length of the river itself. For total phosphorus (TP), inputs from Lake Erie via the Niagara River account for the majority of loading to Lake Ontario and, in some years, exceed the 7000 MTA Lake Ontario target. Between 2014 and 2018, we calculate the mean Niagara River TP loading to be 5275 MTA. We highlight the major changes in water quality constituents over time, including TP, and reveal increased seasonal consumption of TP and SiO2, reflecting potential increases in the biological productivity in Lake Erie. The long and rich Niagara River dataset, which comprises year round sampling (including rare winter data), provides detailed tracking of changing Great Lakes water quality and could be further utilized to assess the impacts of climate change, improve understanding of diatom and harmful algal bloom dynamics, and enhance knowledge of in-lake major ion and nutrient dynamics.

Data from ongoing hydrogeological monitoring were compared with earlier observations conducted during the reclamation process. The results demonstrate that the placement of dredged fill led to the development of suprapermafrost thaw zones (taliks). The anthropogenic taliks vary in thickness from 10 to 15 m in areas of buried bars to 20 m or more in the former locations of oxbow lakes. There is similarity in seasonal groundwater fluctuation patterns and response to river stage variations across the study area suggesting that a continuous aquifer connected to surface water. The connection with the river is most evident during the spring flood period. Two mechanisms of ground saturation are identified during this time. One is lateral seepage flow from the Lena River into the fill mass. The zone of its influence is limited to 150-170 m from the stream. The second is hydraulic pressure transmission from the river through the subchannel flow connected with the anthropogenic suprapermafrost aquifer. Its influence extends across the entire fill area. Continuous water movement at the base of the fill prevents permafrost aggradation from below. The study results should be taken into account when developing and implementing design and construction standards for engineering structures in the reclaimed floodplains of the permafrost zone.					; Popov, Vladimir/AAA-3015-2021; Pavlova, Nadezhda/W-2163-2018	Ogonerov, Vasilii/0000-0002-4032-1744; Pavlova, Nadezhda/0000-0001-5473-7778; Popov, Vladimir/0000-0001-9854-2825; Danzanova, Marina/0000-0002-2559-7590														2076-3263				MAY	2020	10	5							192	10.3390/geosciences10050192	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences10050192													WOS:000541470700007

Effects of Smallmouth Buffalo, Ictiobus bubalus Biomass on Water Transparency, Nutrients, and Productivity in Shallow Experimental Ponds	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The smallmouth buffalo Ictiobus bubalus is a native benthivore to floodplain lakes in the Yazoo River Basin, USA. Based on evidence from other benthivorous fish studies we hypothesized high biomasses of I. bubalus contribute to poor water quality conditions. We tested this hypothesis in shallow (< 1.5 m) 0.05 ha earthen ponds at three stocking biomasses over a 10-week period during the summer of 2012. The most notable results from the permutational multivariate analysis of variance suggest I. bubalus at high and moderate biomasses significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced turbidity and suspended solid levels while decreasing Secchi depth. Our results suggest that effects of I. bubalus on water clarity may have considerable ecological implications in natural habitats such as shallow floodplain lakes.

J	HELLER, J				HELLER, J			VISUAL VERSUS NON-VISUAL SELECTION OF SHELL COLOR IN AN ISRAELI FRESH-WATER SNAIL	OECOLOGIA												The Israeli fresh-water snail T. jordani exhibits high variability both in shell color and shell pattern. In most localities in Israel, more than 80% of the snails are black regardless of the color of their background. Within Lake Kinneret there is a significant association between the relative frequency of dark patterned shells and the distribution of a black (basalt) background. Predators of T. jordani include the fish Barbus longiceps, Blennius fluviatilis and the crab Potamon potamon. In Israel, the former 2 are limited in their distribution to the Kinneret. The distribution of cryptic variants of the snail is positively correlated to the distribution of some of its predators. Beyond the Kinneret, shells are black probably as a result of selection by the injurious effects of UV radiation. Within the Kinneret, snails can manage without an anti-radiation shield probably because the penetration of UV light into the water is considerably reduced, due to the daily summer storms and to the seasonal bloom of unicellular algae. Outside the Kinneret, selective forces for crypsis are partly relaxed and their effects are overidden by selective pressures for solar radiation devices; within the Kinneret, selective pressures for anti-radiation devices are partly reduced and their effects overridden by selective pressures of crypsis.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	44	1					98	104		10.1007/BF00346406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00346406								28310472					WOS:A1980JA23800019

Photic depth decreased by 30% compared with pre-whiting conditions and August volumetric gross photosynthesis was five times lower than the previous year. Levels of phosphorus did not appear affected by CaCO3 precipitation. Aragonite was the major crystalline phase of CaCO3 precipitated. A second whiting was observed in August 1980 and historic lakewater calcium data and satellite photographs also indicated whitings in 1968 and 1973. Lakewater calcium concentrations increased rapidly following whitings but only about 50% of total calcium influx was due to allochthonous inputs. Dissolution of sediment CaCO3 into supersaturated lakewater was experimentally demonstrated. Nucleation of aragonite by a nanoplanktonic alga, Aphanothece clathrata, and influx of high temperature and high calcium content water from geothermal springs and Truckee River are proposed as agents initiating CaCO3 precipitation.																			0003-9136						1985	105	2					137	159																WOS:A1985AWV3900001

Southwestern China is a key Indian summer monsoon region-where continuous land temperature records since late Marine Isotope Stage 3 are scarce. Here we present a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) record based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers membrane lipids (brGDGTs) since 40.2 cal ka BP from Lake Xingyun in southwestern China. The results show the MAAT during the Last Glacial Maximum (26.5-19.0 cal ka BP) was similar to 2 degrees C lower than the present-day. An similar to 3 degrees C increase in MAAT characterized the last deglaciation (19.0-11.7 cal ka BP). The maximum MAAT that occurred during the Early to Middle Holocene (9.5-6.7 cal ka BP) was similar to 3 degrees C higher than the present-day. Five millennial-scale cold events (i. e., Heinrich Events 4 to 1 and the YD) were recorded in the period from glacial to last deglaciation. However, compiled results demonstrate a spatial heterogeneity in the timing of Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in southwestern China, which may be closely related to different climate responses of studied lakes to adjacent Tibetan Plateau and Indian Ocean. These findings provide a perspective for understanding the regional differences in the HTM.

Trevis, Anabaena spiroides Klebahn f. crassa (L.) Elenkin, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs, Melosira granulata (E). Ralfs and Coscinodiscus lacustris Grun. was studied using a close-interval water sampler on a calm summer day in Lake Kasumigaura. Many colonies of Microcystis were observed at the middle of the water column (.apprx. 1.5 m depth) in the afternoon, and at the surface in the early morning. Anabaena occurred mostly in the upper layer; Aphanizomenon tended to be uniformly distributed. The difference in migration patterns suggests that Microcystis is superior to Anabaena and Aphanizomenon in obtaining both light and nutrients from this lake. Among diatoms, Melosira remained at the bottom of the water column throughout day and night, but Coscinodiscus was uniformly distributed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	112	1					53	60		10.1007/BF00007666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007666													WOS:A1984SS09100006

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425													WOS:000410570900004

The urban water and green spaces can help improve cooling and humidifying conditions. However, the synergistic control of both water and neighbouring green spaces on air temperature (T) and humidity (RH) requires the identification of their interactive factors, which has rarely been undertaken. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability of air T and RH effects of urban lake wetlands and four structural composition of green spaces neighbourhoods within a 500 m buffer in the summer in Wuhan, China using a land use regres-sion (LUR) approach. The results indicated that models for air T and RH were successfully developed, with adjusted R-2 of 0.414-0.968 and 0.574-0.984 (P < 0.05), respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that the water area (Area_W), green space area (Area_G), and distance from the wetland (DL) were excellent predictors of air T and RH, whereas wind speed (Wind_S) was the crucial impact variable on RH (P < 0.05). Additionally, urban lake wetlands can significantly strengthen the cooling and humidifying capacity of green spaces within 200 m of the surrounding area. Large lake wetlands consider-ably enhanced T and RH variances across green spaces with different structural compositions, and the air T and RH in the tree-shrub-herb (TSH) green space were the most significant with 0.4-0.9 ? lower T and 1.3-2.1% RH higher than that in herb (H) in the summer.

Species diversity was higher in the hypertrophic area, primarily due to a higher number of Anatid species. Contents of crops, gizzards, and intestines were analysed in 321 of the 361 birds collected. Diet was similar in certain species (Aythya fuligula, A. f ferina, Anas querquedula) despite differences in the trophic state of their habitats. However, in other species (Anas p. platyrhyncha, Aythya nyroca, Bucephala c. clangula), percentage distribution of food items more or less reflected the food resources of the two areas in the digestive tracts. I concluded that the former species are highly selective in their feeding.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						63	69		10.1007/BF00027841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027841													WOS:A1994NK39900007

Northward Shifts in the Polar Front Preceded Bolling and Holocene Warming in Southwestern Scandinavia	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The last deglaciation in northern Europe provides an opportunity to study the hydrologic component of abrupt climate shifts in a region with complex interactions between ice sheets and oceanic and atmospheric circulation. We use leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (delta H-2) to reconstruct summer precipitation delta H-2 and aridity in southwestern Norway from 15.8 to 11.5 ka. We identify transitions to a more proximal moisture source before the ends of Heinrich Stadial 1 and the Younger Dryas, prior to local warming and increased primary productivity in both instances. We infer these changes in moisture delivery to southwestern Norway to be a response to northward shifts in the polar front caused by warm water intrusion into the North Atlantic, which preceded abrupt warming in the circum-North Atlantic. These results suggest that moisture transport pathways shift northward as warm surface ocean water reaches higher latitudes in the North Atlantic.

J	Lee, J; An, SM				Lee, Jiyoung; An, Soonmo			High ammonium recycling in an anthropogenically altered Yeongsan River Estuary, South Korea	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Regenerated nitrogen (N) cycling was studied in a turbid and nutrient-rich estuary located in the southeast region of the Yellow Sea (Yeongsan River Estuary; YRE), in order to elucidate the biogeochemical consequences of coastal development. Ammonium regeneration and potential uptake rates were measured from March 2012 to June 2013 using N-15 tracer techniques. Size fractionation suggested that small-sized bacteria (<0.7 mu m), rather than zooplankton, were responsible for most of the ammonium regeneration. Intermittent freshwater discharge events might have prevented stable zooplankton community development and caused the insignificant role of zooplankton in ammonium regeneration. Ammonium regeneration and potential uptake rates were relatively high (0.1-1.2 and 0.2-1.5 mu mol L-1 h(-1), respectively), and were highest during summer. Ammonium turnover times were shorter than water residence times throughout the study period. These results indicate that ammonium is actively recycled and is likely to supply enough N required to sustain the high primary productivity observed in the YRE (50%-450%). Reduced turbidity and increased water residence times caused by the construction of an estuarine dam in the YRE have probably resulted in the formation of optimal conditions for the high ammonium regeneration.																				2296-7745				DEC 8	2022	9								1017434	10.3389/fmars.2022.1017434	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1017434													WOS:000901520000001

Solitary Impulse Wave Transformation to Overland Flow	JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING												Impulse waves are generated by avalanches, landslides, rock slides, rock falls, or glacier calving impact into natural lakes or reservoirs. Similar to tsunamis, the generated long waves imply a large damage potential to the surrounding infrastructure and settlements. The current hazard assessment is mainly limited to plane wave run-up because previous studies were related to linearly inclined slopes. The presented study therefore focuses on solitary impulse wave-induced overland flow on a horizontal shore. Physical experiments involved a two-dimensional test setup in a wave channel including a piston-type wave generator and an inclined shore with a connected horizontal overland flow plane. Particular focus is given to the transition from the inclined to the horizontal portion, where the orbital wave motion is transformed into a shore-parallel flow. The overland flow features were investigated by means of ultrasonic distance sensors and particle image velocimetry for various values of relative wave height, shore slope, and freeboard. Prediction equations are specified for the maximum flow depths, flow velocities, and the maximum discharge. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Field investigations in the highly eutrophic Bautzen Reservoir and flow-through experiments in the laboratory were combined in a study on the mid-summer decline of Daphnia galeata. We tested the hypothesis that the inability of adult Daphnia to reduce the size of their large and dense feeding appendages in response to fast increasing food levels after a clear-water phase enhances adult mortality. Adult survival in the laboratory (predation excluded) drastically decreased exactly at that time when the Daphnia population in Bautzen Reservoir declined. However, enhanced adult mortality was found irrespective of different food conditions offered during the experiments. We conclude that increased mortality of adult daphnids is not a direct effect of their inability to adapt to high seston concentrations.

Ecosystem Effects of a Tropical Cyclone on a Network of Lakes in Northeastern North America	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Here we document the regional effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene on thermal structure and ecosystem metabolism in nine lakes and reservoirs in northeastern North America using a network of high-frequency, in situ, automated sensors. Thermal stability declined within hours in all systems following passage of Irene, and the magnitude of change was related to the volume of water falling on the lake and catchment relative to lake volume. Across systems, temperature change predicted the change in primary production, but changes in mixed-layer thickness did not affect metabolism. Instead, respiration became a driver of ecosystem metabolism that was decoupled from in-lake primary production, likely due to addition of terrestrially derived carbon. Regionally, energetic disturbance of thermal structure was shorter-lived than disturbance from inflows of terrestrial materials. Given predicted regional increases in intense rain events with climate change, the magnitude and longevity of ecological impacts of these storms will be greater in systems with large catchments relative to lake. volume, particularly when significant material is available for transport from the catchment. This case illustrates the power of automated sensor networks and associated human networks in assessing both system response and the characteristics that mediate physical and ecological responses to extreme events.

The investigation was carried out during the dry season, when previous investigations showed that the spatial heterogeneity is more stable. A multi-parameter Yellow Springs Instruments probe coupled to a TechGeo D-GPS was used. This system is equipped to measure and store in a continuous recording mode, several physical and chemical parameters linked to geographical coordinates obtained with a precision of less than 1 m. We used different geostatistical approaches to determine the optimal number of sampling points required to reflect the real spatial patterns of water quality in the system. This approach was tested in a small tropical reservoir (Ibirite) that receives effluents from an oil refinery (the state-owned RECAP oil refinery, PETROBRAS) located near the city of Belo Horizonte. The study showed not only that the spatial patterns of water quality are significantly affected by sampling effort but also it was demonstrated that the establishment of an adequate sampling program is a critical point for the precise identification of source points of pollution. The results of this investigation enabled us to demonstrate the potential uses and limits of this method for rapid assessment of the water quality of lakes and reservoirs that receive external inputs of water contaminants or nutrients.

The primary objective of the study was to correlate the seasonal fluctuations in phytoplankton abundance to the environmental variables. Total chlorophyll content and FCM based cell counts were used to characterize and quantify the phytoplankton population. Multivariate statistical methods were employed in predicting the possible relationships between biotic and abiotic variables. Distinct seasonal variations characterized by high abundance during the pre-summer period compared to other seasons were detected. The results indicated that environmental factors like water temperature and nutrients, such as various forms of nitrogen and phosphate, influenced the seasonal phytoplankton accumulation. Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling helped analyze the seasonal distribution of phytoplankton based on their composition. The dominant genera among the entire phytoplankton community were Scenedesmus spp. of Chlorophyta, followed by Merismopedia spp. of Cyanoprokaryota. Around 3.7 x 10(5) phytoplankton mL(-1) were recorded during the study period. Due to the very high count of individual species in the community, FCM based counting was applied for determination of Species Diversity Index. The entire population was divided into 13 subpopulations based on the cell sorting method and the seasonal abundance in each sub-population was illustrated.					; Mondal, Pronoy Kanti/GLR-4171-2022	Gorain, Prakash Chandra/0000-0002-4951-7567; PAL, RUMA/0000-0002-8017-7222														2046-2069					2018	8	17					9530	9545		10.1039/c7ra12761h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra12761h								35541887					WOS:000431972600060
B	Williams, M		Daniels, JA		Williams, Martin			RIVER RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE TROPICS: A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR HISTORY OF THE NILE	ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH, VOL 4	Advances in Environmental Research-Nova											The complex response of big tropical rivers to climate change is often hard to discern when the available instrumental records span only a few decades, so that the hydrological record from the past provides an invaluable guide to present and future climate change. The Nile is the longest river in the world with a total length of 6 670 km, spanning 35 degrees of latitude between 3 degrees S and 32 degrees N and has the longest historical flood record of any river in the world. The Nile basin presently covers nearly three million km(2) but was even larger as recently as 7 000 years ago. The Nile consists of three very distinct hydrological systems: the Ugandan lakes and the White Nile, the Ethiopian volcanic highlands and the Blue Nile, and the main or Saharan Nile. The Blue Nile provides much of the summer discharge and sediment load to the main Nile, but the White Nile provides over 80% of Nile discharge during the month of lowest flow and is responsible for maintaining perennial flow in the Nile during drought years in Ethiopia. During the last 300 000 years the summer monsoon has fluctuated in response to astronomically controlled changes in tropical insolation, with times of low and variable Nile river discharge coinciding with cold, dry glacial climates in the headwaters and enhanced flow with warm, wet interglacial climates. Over the past five centuries, at least, times of low flow coincide with El Nino events in Peru and times of high flow with La Nina years. Years of low Nile flow are synchronous with drought years in India, China, Java, Thailand and Australia, and conversely. This pattern is likely to persist into the future, albeit with subtle variations.																					978-1-61668-169-2				2010	4						39	59																WOS:000284283100002

Based on this, we study the composition, spatiotemporal changes, and primary sources of DOM using the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The relationship between DOM composition and water quality was also discussed. It was found that the DOM in the North Canal River watershed was composed of two similar humic acid-like components (230, 335/400 nm and 260, 360/450 nm) and a tryptophan-like component (280/290-350 nm). The intensity of DOM shows obvious seasonal spatiotemporal variations. In terms of time, the relative concentration of DOM in winter is significantly higher than that in other seasons due to the influence of water volume, temperature, and photochemical degradation factors. As for the aspect of space, under the combined effect of land use and multiple sources of pollution, the relative concentration of tryptophan-like in the mainstream was significantly higher than tributaries, while the relative concentration of humic-like components in the tributaries was higher than that in the mainstream. The chief sources of DOM in the North Canal River watershed include human-derived point sources and agricultural non-point sources in the main channel, as well as terrestrial and microbiological sources in the tributaries. Moreover, the composition of DOM is significantly related to water quality indicators, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, which shows that DOM can have an indicative impact on the trophic status in the North Canal River. The findings of this study could have a predictive effect and provide a scientific foundation for water quality monitoring and pollution control in the North Canal River watershed.

However, little is known about the holistic pattern of agricultural land use change across China, especially from the perspective of intensity since the evidence has been gathered mainly through case studies at local levels. This study conducts a systemic review of agricultural land use change and its underlying drivers in China by aggregating 169 relevant case studies from 123 publications. The cases related to intensification and disintensification, which are the two types of agricultural land use change, are generally equal, accounting for 50% of the total number of cases. Intensification and disintensification can be further divided into the same three categories: expansion/contraction of agricultural land, changes in agricultural land use activities and changes in land management intensity. Demographic, economic, technological, and institutional drivers, together with location factors, are frequently noted as significant underlying drivers, while sociocultural drivers and farm(er) characteristics are less frequently recognized. Finally, three major land use change trajectories are summarized mainly concerning rising labor costs and the concomitant increase in off-farm employment, the ecological improvement policy, and advances in agricultural technology.

Among the 22 forest types classified, multi-temporal image analysis aided in separating 13 types. Of greatest significance, trembling aspen, sugar maple, northern red oak, northern pin oak black ash, and tamarack were successfully classified. The overall classification accuracy was 83.2 percent and the forest classification accuracy was 80.1 percent.

C, 56% of the warm water plankton isolates and 48% of the warm water periphyton isolates were incapable of growth and therefore probably could not be important components of the winter algal community. At 25.degree. C, 25% of the cold water plankton isolates and 13% of the cold water periphyton isolates were incapable of growth. Thus, temperature alone probably is an important variable regulating seasonal changes in algal community structure. Pollution of these habitats by a thermal enrichment averaging +5.degree. C year-round could effect a pronounced change in algal species composition because many more taxa could be perennial and more taxa would be incapable of growth during naturally warm periods.																				1529-8817					1983	19	4					380	386		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1983.00380.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1983.00380.x													WOS:A1983SC96200002
J	Caruso, BS				Caruso, BS			Spatial and temporal variability of stream phosphorus in a New Zealand high-country agricultural catchment	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Spatial and temporal variability of stream total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and loadings was evaluated over a year in a high-country agricultural catchment. One storm event was also sampled at the inflow to a lake. An upland tributary had the highest median concentration (0.064 mg l(-1)), but the maximum (0.614 mg l(-1)) occurred at the inflow during the storm. Values near the lake surface were low but increased with depth in summer. There was a large difference between two streams, and values exceeded water quality guidelines in several locations. Seasonality in concentrations was not evident. Mean and median loadings at the inflow were approximately 7000 and 680 g day(-1) respectively, and the maximum was 81 540 g day(-1) during the storm. TP loadings to the lake during a synoptic survey were 470 g day(-1) or 13 g km(-2) day(-1). The lower half of the catchment contributed 72% of the loading to the lake. Baseflow, snowmelt, and one storm accounted for 47%, 30%, and 23%, respectively, of the total annual loading. Fertiliser, livestock waste, and trampling of stream banks by livestock contribute to the problem and can be minimised though use of best management practices in areas identified in this study.

Patterns of alluvial deposition in Andean lake consistent with ENSO trigger	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The laminated sediment record from Laguna Pallcacocha, Ecuador, is widely used as a sensitive recorder of past variability in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, limited knowledge of local meteorology, hydrogeomorphic processes, and the lateral variability of the lacustrine stratigraphy have resulted in some ambiguity in proxy interpretation. In this study, we report new high-resolution meteorological data, hydrogeomorphic mapping of the catchment and geochemistry of the lake's sediments. We show that the fine clastic layers are deposited from alluvial activity in the catchment related to intensive rainfall events originating from the Pacific. Frequency analyses of the geochemistry of the sediments indicates that the clastic layers in L. Pallcacocha fall into the characteristic ENSO frequency band and most likely record Eastern Pacific and Coastal Pacific El Nino events. We also illustrate that recent debris flow deposition has resulted in an abrupt avulsion of the main fluvial channels, redirecting sediment input between the lake's two basins and possibly influencing the lithostratigraphy of the sediment package of L. Pallcacocha. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Pigment budgets showed that chlorophyll production and pigment resuspension were both major sources of water column pigments. Photodegradation rates were rapid and indicated that detritus particles that remained in the epilimnion for periods longer than about 3 days lost nearly all detectable pigments. Therefore, only rapidly sinking detrital particles or those produced in deep layers at low light intensity could make appreciable contributions to sedimentary chlorophyll degradation products. Pheophorbide a, a grazing indicator, was the dominant chlorophyll a degradation product found in sediment traps. Pigment sedimentation increased significantly with mean size of cladocerans and omnivorous copepods. In contrast, sedimentation rates of chlorophyll degradation products did not increase with primary production. In these lakes,the deposition of chlorophyll degradation products in sediments dependent primarily on the size and biomass of grazers.

The peak odor rating of the fishy odor was 7 according to flavor profile analysis. Among the dominant algal species (two diatom and one chrysophyte species) observed during the survey, the chrysophyte Dinobryon sp. was the most abundant species, with the peak density recorded at 88,520 cells/mL. Seven potential algal metabolites including heptanal, 2,4-heptadienal, 2,4-decadienal, nonanal, 2-octenal, 2,6-nonadienal and hexanal were detected. The principal component analysis result showed that n-hexanal, n-heptanal and 2,4-decadienal, possibly the metabolites of diatoms, and 2,4-heptadienal, possibly the metabolite of Dinobryon sp., might have contributed to the fishy odor episode. This study demonstrated that the fishy odor episode in this reservoir might be caused by the abnormal growth of chrysophytes and diatoms under the ice-cover.

This study seeks to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of water salinity and their implication on the downstream water availability in the marginal grabens of northern Ethiopia. We measured the electrical conductivity (EC) of flash floods, baseflows, springs, wells, and lakes. A total of 1,168 samples was collected from 177 spatially distributed water sources (2016-2017). This study shows that there was a significant difference in the EC values of the water points between rainy (1,403 +/- 425 mu S cm(-1)) and dry seasons (2,261 +/- 258 mu S cm(-1)). Besides, there is an inverse relationship between the river discharges and the runoff EC in the study area. The average value of the water EC was also higher in the limestone area than in the basalt sites. In addition, the water EC increased from the escarpments (396 +/- 176 mu S cm(-1)) towards the outlets of the graben basins (1,670 +/- 942 mu S cm(-1)). These water EC hotspots in the dry season imply that the river basins are in a closing status due to the erratic rainfall and water extraction by humans. However, the rising water EC and moisture stress endanger the existing agricultural development. Because of the extent and seriousness of salinity, integrated catchment management strategies are needed to tackle the degrading water quality and quantity in the marginal grabens along the northern Ethiopia Rift Valley.					frankl, amaury/J-5908-2012; Nyssen, Jan/B-8280-2009; Abraha, Amanuel Zenebe/JFA-0811-2023; Demissie, Biadgilgn/AAR-1330-2021; Meaza, Hailemariam/AID-1700-2022; , Veerle Van Eetvelde/HII-8269-2022; Frankl, Amaury/J-5908-2012	frankl, amaury/0000-0002-1685-2780; Nyssen, Jan/0000-0002-2666-3860; Asfaha, Tesfaalem Ghebreyohannes/0000-0002-9094-8414; Van Eetvelde, Veerle/0000-0003-2382-6182; Gebregergs, Hailemariam Meaza/0000-0003-3720-208X; Demissie, Biadgilgn/0000-0002-3082-9560; ABRAHA, Amanuel Zenebe/0000-0001-6571-9065; POESEN, Jean/0000-0001-6218-8967													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 30	2019	30	12					1407	1422		10.1002/ldr.3321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3321													WOS:000475471300002

The Middle Stone Age of West Turkana, Kenya	JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY												Research on the origins of Homo sapiens and the development of our species' unique behavior is focused on the Middle Stone Age (MSA) period in Africa (in comparison with the European Upper Palaeolithic). Although archaeological and paleontological fieldwork in the Turkana Basin in northwestern Kenya has contributed greatly to our understanding of human evolution in Africa, the Basin's MSA archaeological record remains poorly known. We report on a reconnaissance of MSA sites in West Turkana, Kenya, which included known archaeological/paleoanthropological localities at Eliye Springs and Kabua Waterhole (Kadokorinyang). A newly-discovered site, Nakechichok 1 (GdJh 5), preserves MSA tools stratified beneath Late Stone Age assemblages. The MSA lithic artifacts from Nakechichok 1 differ from those known from other MSA localities in nearby regions, and, they expand the known scope of MSA variability in the Turkana Basin, demonstrating that the MSA is not "missing" in this region, but just hard to find.																			0093-4690	2042-4582				DEC	2010	35	4					355	364		10.1179/009346910X12707321358630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/009346910X12707321358630													WOS:000289155600002

Fish were introduced into five of ten channels and the epilithic algae growing on tiles were sampled four times during summer to determine biomass, algal physiognomy and species composition in relation to presence of fish and invertebrate community structure. Diatom biomass showed distinctive development patterns, increasing at the beginning of fish introduction and decreasing towards the end of the experiment. The responses were the reverse in the absence of fish. Chrysophyceae increased in the absence of fish, particularly at the end of the experiment. From the seven algal physiognomic types considered, epilithon overstory, attached erected algae and loosely attached algae were generally more abundant in the presence of fish. Species' biomass was markedly different in both treatments and followed contrasted temporal patterns. In the presence of fish, attached erected diatoms species rapidly reached a complex spatial overstory structure, while in the absence of fish the epilithic community remained at a younger successional stage. Partial redundancy analysis showed that those changes were mediated by large grazing invertebrates, which had lower abundance over the bottom surfaces in the presence of fish. Variance partitioning analysis reinforced the hypothesis that most of the variability in epilithic community structure was explained by fish-invertebrate interactions and that the effect of fish presence alone was not significant. The results show that reduction in total epilithic algal biomass was a transient top-down effect, but the three-trophic level control on major taxa, species composition and community physiognomy remained along the summer experiment.

J	Olsen, P; Doran, B				Olsen, P; Doran, B			Climatic modelling of the Australian distribution of the grass owl (Tyto capensis):: is there an inland population?	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The Australian distribution of the grass owl (Tyto capensis) is poorly understood. It has been proposed that there are two centres of distribution: a resident coastal population in the north-east, and a less stable inland population from which there is Australia-wide dispersal when good seasons are followed by deteriorating conditions. We analysed records of the grass owl and modelled its bioclimatic profile and distribution, which was typically subtropical, warm to hot humid with no dry season or a dry winter. This predicted a north-east sub-coastal to coastal, permanently occupied, core distribution for the owl. We found no evidence for a permanent or isolated inland population, nor for inland populations being the sole source of dispersers, as has been suggested previously. Most inland and northern records were made in the 1970s when grass owls colonised the arid inland, the Kimberley and the far north of the country in association with events leading to the flooding of Lake Eyre. The data suggest that grass owls disperse from their core range after exceptionally good breeding seasons to areas made temporarily favourable by exceptional rainfall or flooding, only to disperse again when conditions become drier. These dispersal events are not tied uniquely to outbreaks of the long-haired rat (Rattus villosissimus), but to a variety of terrestrial prey with dynamic life histories driven by rainfall.					; Doran, Bruce/A-4946-2008	Doran, Bruce/0000-0002-4214-2205; 													1035-3712						2002	29	2					117	125	UNSP 1035-3712/02/020117	10.1071/WR01030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR01030													WOS:000176127300001

The results were compared with the values or ranges mentioned by standard organizations (WHO and BIS) for assessing the water quality and these revealed that the lake water was turbid and under DO distress. Various water quality indices like water quality index (WQI), Canadian Council Ministry of Environment (CCME)-WQI and comprehensive pollution index (CPI) were used to assess the water quality status in the Sukhna Lake. The range of WQI (59.74-83.49) indicated that the water quality status of the lake belonged to good category while those of CCME-WQI (52.4-81.61) revealed that water quality fallen from marginal to good category and those of CPI (0.4-0.7) indicated fair state of water in the lake.

Petrographic, morphological, and microscopic techniques were applied to describe samples collected from three sites on an ooid shoal. Observations made on dominant grains (ooids) are size distribution, mineralogy, morphology, internal cortical architecture. Mean grain sizes of ooids for the three stations are 329, 429, and 412 mu m and the samples fall into two textural categories, described as poorly to moderately sorted medium-grained sand, and poorly sorted sand. Microorganisms in symbiotic relationships with the ooids belong to cyanobacteria and foraminifera. They were found boring or attached to the surfaces of the ooids and were taxonomically described.

Flooding of the pit began by the end of March, 2008 and, since then, a large mine lake (similar to 2 km(2) surface and up to 210 m depth) is being formed. To follow the flooding process, a comprehensive hydrochemical survey has been initiated. The data available to date show that the lake has developed a pronounced stratification that responds to the differences in the source of flooding waters and geochemical processes involving the progressive consumption of oxygen from the water column. At its present stage of evolution, Meirama is a meromictic lake structured in a thick monimolimnion (similar to 50 m) that is evolving towards hypoxic conditions, beneath a mixolimnion that, within the studied two-year time frame, has experienced, at least, one winter turnover.

Late Miocene (Tortonian) gonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts from the Vienna Basin, Austria	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												During the Late Miocene (Tortonian or Pannonian regional stage), at around 11.6 Ma, a glacioeustatically-driven sea-level fall caused the final closure of the Paratethys Ocean and Lake Pannon was formed in central Europe. Tile lake was initially brackish, but slowly freshened and became slightly alkaline. These unusual changes in water chemistry produced the radiation of a characteristic assemblage of gonyaulacacean dinoflagellate cysts. This study examined 94 samples from the Pannonian of Hennersdorf Clay Pit, south of Vienna, Austria. From this material, Achomosphaera brevis sp. nov., Seriliodinium? imperfecta sp. nov. and Spiniferites hennersdorfensis sp. nov. were apparently endemic to the Central Paratethys during the Late Miocene. Spiniferites bentorii (Rossignol 1964) Wall and Dale, 1970 subsp. oblongus Sutone-Szentai 1986 and Spiniferites bentorii (Rossignol, 1964) Wall and Dale 1970 subsp. pannonicus Sutone-Szentai 1986 are elevated to species status. The genus Spiniferites exhibited significant morphological variability especially in terms of general shape, apical boss development and process morphology.

Nutrient Variation in an Urban Lake Chain and its Consequences for Phytoplankton Production	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												In the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) ecosystem, managers divert mixed stream water and groundwater to maintain an artificial lake chain in Indian Bend Wash (IBW), a historically flashy, ephemeral, desert stream. Nutrient concentrations in the CAP ecosystem's groundwater, stream water, and floodwater differ: stream water has low concentrations of both inorganic N and P, while groundwater is low in inorganic P but rich in nitrate (NO3-). Consequently, groundwater contribution drives inorganic N concentrations in the lake chain. In contrast, floodwater typically has high P concentrations while remaining low in N. Thus we expected N and P concentrations in IBW lakes to vary with the mix of water flowing through them. Elevated NO3- and low inorganic P concentrations were predicted when groundwater pumping was pronounced and this prediction was supported. We hypothesized that these predictable changes in water chemistry would affect nutrient limitation of phytoplankton. Laboratory nutrient-addition bioassays demonstrated that phytoplankton growth was P-limited throughout the summer of 2003 when N/P was high. However, after a late-season flood drove N/P below 31:1, the expected threshold between N and P limitation, N limitation was observed. Our results indicate that effects of floods, the preeminent historic drivers of Sonoran Desert stream biogeochemistry, are mitigated in urban ecosystems by decisions about which spigots to turn. Consequently, nutrient limitation of urban streams is driven as much by management decisions as by natural hydrologic variation.

J	Allen, KR				Allen, KR			Some observations on the biology of the trout (salmo trutta) in Windermere	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												From a study of scales, mean annual growth was found to remain nearly constant throughout life, at about 7 cm. per year. The majority of young fish enter the lake from the streams where hatched when 2 years old. The fish grow most rapidly during the summer time, and their relative weight is greatest during period of most rapid growth.

Mortality due to non-predation factors is often ignored even though anecdotal evidence of non-predation mass mortality of zooplankton has been reported repeatedly. One way to estimate non-predation mortality rate is to measure the removal rate of carcasses, for which sinking is the primary removal mechanism especially in quiescent shallow water bodies. Objectives and Results We used sediment traps to quantify in situ carcass sinking velocity and non-predation mortality rate on eight consecutive days in 2013 for the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris in the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Stechlin; the outcomes were compared against estimates derived from in vitro carcass sinking velocity measurements and an empirical model correcting in vitro sinking velocity for turbulence resuspension and microbial decomposition of carcasses. Our results show that the latter two approaches produced unrealistically high mortality rates of 0.58-1.04 d(-1), whereas the sediment trap approach, when used properly, yielded a mortality rate estimate of 0.015 d(-1), which is more consistent with concurrent population abundance data and comparable to physiological death rate from the literature. Ecological implications Zooplankton carcasses may be exposed to water column microbes for days before entering the benthos; therefore, non-predation mortality affects not only zooplankton population dynamics but also microbial and benthic food webs. This would be particularly important for carbon and nitrogen cycles in systems where recurring mid-summer decline of zooplankton population due to non-predation mortality is observed.

Such variability does not result from a simple mixing process between surface freshwaters and deeper saline waters. The variability, observed at the scale of a few square kilometers, would preferentially result from a secondary concentration processes (evaporation and/or cryogenesis) of lake waters of variable intensity from one lake to another. The U-disequilibria data suggest that the duration of the secondary process is certainly an important parameter to be considered to account for the variable salinity of these lakes. The data indicate that the lakes, however modest in size, could be as old as several ky, confirming therefore that the lake sedimentary deposits could represent relevant paleoenvironmental recorders for the last thousands years.

Charcoal morphotypes in lake sediments from British Columbia (Canada): an assessment of their utility for the reconstruction of past fire and precipitation	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Quantitative analysis of variations in morphological types of charcoal were undertaken in sediment cores from three lakes on the Interior Plateau (BC, Canada) over the period AD 1919-2000. Seven distinct morphological types of charcoal were identified based on particle shape and structural features and were compared with seasonal precipitation and recorded area burned within 20 km-radius of study lakes. Fragile-type charcoal fragments, termed type M, displayed significant relationships to recorded area burned in sediment cores from Prosser (r(2)p = 0.5; p = 0.0001) and Opatcho (r(2)p = 0.2; p = 0.02) lakes. However, nonsignificant correlations (p > 0.05) were found between total charcoal and area burned. Robust and highly elongated morphotypes C and F were correlated to recorded spring precipitation (r(2)p = 0.5; p = 0.002) in Opatcho Lake. Charcoal from a sediment core from Big Lake, the lake with the largest watershed, was significantly but inversely related to past fires (r(2)p = 0.44; p = 0.0003), suggesting important contributions from secondary transportation and deposition. Models were developed to infer relative area burned and precipitation for the study lakes. Our results suggest that charcoal morphotypes are related to the biogeoclimatic and lake watershed characteristics. This study also suggest that charcoal morphotypes can provide insights on past fire and climate, which was not possible based on traditional analysis of total charcoal.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2007	38	3					347	363		10.1007/s10933-006-9084-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9084-8													WOS:000249406400004
J	Perotti, MG; Diégeuz, MD				Perotti, Maria Gabriela; del Carmen Diegeuz, Maria			Effect of UV-B exposure on eggs and embryos of patagonian anurans and evidence of photoprotection	CHEMOSPHERE												In Patagonia, enhanced levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are affecting not only the southernmost territories but the northern as well, and there is a growing body of evidence indicating effects on terrestrial and aquatic communities. Anurans occur along a wide geographical gradient in Patagonia and are common in shallow waters, usually breeding during spring when seasonal UV-B radiation is at its highest level. In this paper we analyse the effective irradiances (I) experienced in nature by eggs and embryos of the patagonian anurans Pleurodema bufoninum, Pleurodema thaul and Bufo spinulosus papillosus, considering water and egg jelly optical properties. Besides, we deter-mine photoprotective pigments in eggs and embryos of the different species, and ontogenetic shifts in pigment concentration. Finally, we studied the effects of natural and enhanced levels of UV-B on eggs of P. bufoninum aiming to evaluate the role of the jelly envelope in screening the damaging radiation. The evidence gathered in this work shows that natural and enhanced UV-B levels did not induce significant changes on the survivorship but incremented the occurrence of malformations. Also, the species experiencing high levels of exposure presented high concentrations of melanin suggesting that exposure to sunlight triggers photoprotection by pigments. Collectively our results suggest that the studied species bear certain levels of adaptation to cope with high ambient UVR conferred by environmental and biological factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	KRECHMAR, AV				KRECHMAR, AV			ECOLOGY OF CYGNUS-CYGNUS IN THE ANADYR RIVER BASIN	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The whooper swan is a common nesting bird in particular landscapes of the middle Anadyr flow where it populates small and medium size lakes in alas depressions. In spring the swans appear earlier than all other water birds and begin to nest soon after, during the third 10-day period of May. The nestlings appear in the end of June-beginning of July and keep to overgrown shoals until the time for flight. In the case of early frosts the birds can actively prevent ice formation, allowing the fledglings to become more robust before the flight. Embryonic mortality is insignificant but the mortality of nestlings during the 1st weeks of life can be high. In spite of the shortage in the time necessary for the full reproductive cycle, the Anadyr population of whooper swans is very stable.																			0044-5134						1982	61	3					402	410																WOS:A1982NK05600010

However, well-dated research spanning periods exceeding 50 ka in the late Quaternary remains scarce because of the limited dating range of the C-14 method. Therefore, we collected a 33.9-m long lacustrine sedimentary core (PT2) from SW China for a chronology study in the late Quaternary using geomagnetic excursion (GE) and relative paleointensity (RPI) correlation. This study will improve our understanding of the dynamics and evolutionary rules of the ISM. Detailed rock magnetic analyses showed that single domain- and vortex-state magnetite (and/or maghemite) dominated the magnetic properties in moderate and strong magnetic intervals. Moderate variations in concentration-dependent (SIRM, ARM) and grain size-dependent (ARM/SIRM) parameters satisfied the criteria for RPI research. Consequently, we present the magnetostratigraphy and RPI record of the PT2 lacustrine sedimentary core based on stepwise alternating field demagnetization. Five GEs were identified by at least three continuous reversed inclinations. Using the radiocarbon dating results as constraints, we identified the Hilina Pali, Mono Lake, and Laschamp excursions. By proxy correlation with the adjacent sedimentary core, an age tie of 140.07 ka was obtained. Subsequently, four RPI lows matched the NRM/ARM troughs in the adjacent HQ2002 drill core according to their synchronous changes. Based on the age ties above, post-Blake and Blake excursions were identified. Accordingly, three RPI lows were correlated with troughs in the global target curve PISO-1500 between 60 and 100 ka. Using AMS C-14 dates, proxy-matched ties, magnetic excursions, and RPI correlation ties as constraints, we established an age-depth model of the PT2 lacustrine sequence since similar to 184 ka.					xu, xinwen/OEN-8727-2025; yang, ziyi/JGD-5349-2023	xu, xinwen/0000-0003-4826-8703													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 15	2024	640								112067	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112067		FEB 2024											WOS:001188880600001

Furthermore, it is necessary to control lake sediment outflow in order to preserve the ecological balance of the lake. Soil stabilization methods could be used to prevent the erosion of bottom sediment. Therefore, this study explored the physical and mechanical condition of the lake bed in situ to aid the identification of an effective erosion prevention scheme based on solidification methods. Two locations on the lake bottom were investigated and compared: one where the sediment dried up in summer, and the other where the sediment was saturated with water throughout the year. Undisturbed samples were collected using a thin-walled stainless steel tube sampler. The shear strength and its depth distribution in the lake bed were measured using the vane shear test. The depth distributions of the shear strength at the two sampling locations studied were found to be rather different. The shear strength was highest in the surface layer at the location that was dry in summer, whereas the shear strength was lowest in the surface layer at the location that was always wet. The shear strength of the surface layer (20 mm depth) at the wet/dry location was 3.3 kPa and there was 93.1% moisture, while the shear strength at this depth at the permanently wet location was 1.8 kPa and there was 95.7% moisture. The strength of the wet/dry sediment, which underwent shrinkage when drying, was greater than that of the permanently wet sediment. This finding could facilitate the classification of areas that require soil improvement as well as the rational design of an erosion prevention plan.

It appears that the lakes may be colder than the open sea during wintertime by as much as 2-3 degrees C and warmer at the surface during summer by as much as 4 degrees C. Several interesting processes were captured within the series of which we investigated the wintertime cooling that occurred in 2006, diurnal and semidiurnal temperature changes driven by the tides within the connecting channel and the occurrence of turbulence in BL close to the connecting channel. The latter seems to have large implications for the thermocline/pycnocline deepening during the summertime, as incoming open ocean waters are much denser than the BL waters.					zuljevic, ante/R-7455-2016; Vilibic, Ivica/AAE-5160-2019; Nikolic, Vedran/I-6037-2013														0001-5113	1846-0453				DEC	2010	51	2																						WOS:000287612400001

Simulations of fully coupled lake-groundwater exchange in a subhumid climate with an integrated hydrologic model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[ 1] A fully coupled, integrated surface water/groundwater model was used to study hydrologic controls on lake-groundwater interaction in the subhumid, Boreal Plains of northern Alberta, Canada. Findings from a previous water budget study indicate that lakes on the outwash landscape capture groundwater as a major source of water input and function as evaporation windows. Transient hydrologic responses of a flow-through style lake and outwash groundwater flow system were simulated for a three-dimensional model. Hydraulic heads, surface water depth, and the corresponding exchange fluxes between the surface and the subsurface were all simulated simultaneously and compared to field observations for the summers of 2002 and 2003. Replication of the transient flow regime required an anisotropy ratio of 10: 1 for the outwash deposits and inclusion of riparian peatlands, which control lake-groundwater interaction and maintain surface water on permeable northern landscapes. Spatially and temporally variable evapotranspiration governed the water table configuration and lake-groundwater seepage patterns.

Quentin			Optimal groundwater extraction under uncertainty: Resilience versus economic payoffs	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper evaluates the trade-off between resilience and economic payoffs in terms of groundwater extraction where there is a risk of an irreversible and catastrophic event. A dynamic and spatial model is developed that incorporates a stochastic recharge process and the risk of an irreversible catastrophic event (such as saltwater intrusion) that arises when hydraulic heads fall below a given threshold. The results show that if the threshold is uncertain then controlling both the rate and depth of extraction can generate a higher economic return and a lower probability of crossing the threshold than only controlling the rate of extraction. This occurs even if the extraction rate is set optimally and is less than the extraction rate than when two forms of control are used. The model and findings provide an applied framework to understand and to quantify where there might be 'win-win' outcomes, and trade-offs between economic payoffs and resilience in terms of groundwater extraction.

For both lakes, a trend towards shorter ice duration and earlier ice-off can be observed in the 86 and 81 year data records, respectively. For Lake Neusiedl, significant trends for ice-on (+2.3 days decade (-1)), ice-off ( -1.8 days decade (-1)) and ice duration (-3.1 day decade (-1)) are detected. At Lake Balaton, however, trends for ice-on (0 day decade (-1)), ice-off (-0.7 days decade (-1)) and ice duration ( -1.2 days decade (-1)) are not significant. The temporal trends have accelerated for Lake Neusiedl in the past 60 years (ice duration -5.6 days decade (-1)). The variability of the ice parameters has increased during the 80 year observation period for Lake Neusiedl, but not for Lake Balaton. The number of melt-refreeze cycles at Lake Balaton increased at first, but then decreased during the last 20 years at both lakes. Warming trends in mean surface water temperatures for all seasons are more distinct than temporal trends of mean air temperatures. Increases of winter air temperature by 1 degrees C are related to an ice-on delay, a decrease in ice duration (Lake Balaton: -12 days degrees C (-1), R-2=0.72; Lake Neusiedl: -11 day degrees C (-1), R-2=0.54) and an earlier ice-off.

The abundance of planktivorous juvenile yellow perch, Perca flavescens, was manipulated in three 750 m3 enclosures in a eutrophic lake. 2. There was a significant negative relationship between fish and zooplankton biomasses. At high fish densities the zooplankton community was dominated by small filter-feeding cladocera, primarily bosminids. At low fish densities the zooplankton community was dominated by large filter-feeding cladocera, primarily daphnids. 3. There was no significant relationship between zooplankton and phytoplankton biomasses when considered over the whole experiment but there was a trend towards lower phytoplankton biomass in the enclosure dominated by daphnids during mid-summer. 4. We conclude that although planktivorous fish have a strong negative impact on zooplankton community biomass and size structure, the relationship at the next lower trophic level, zooplankton and phytoplankton, is much weaker. Therefore, the biomanipulation of planktivorous fish populations as a management technique to control phytoplankton abundance is largely ineffective.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1987	17	1					79	89		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01030.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01030.x													WOS:A1987G318300007

Among these contributors, approximately half of the inflow is attributed to the Zarrineh River and the Simineh River. Remarkably, Lake Urmia lacks a natural outlet, with its water loss occurring solely through evaporation processes. This study employed a comprehensive methodology integrating ground surveys, remote sensing analyses, and meticulous documentation of historical landslides within the basin as primary information sources. Through this investigative approach, we preciselyidentified and geolocated a total of 512 historical landslide occurrences across the Urmia Lake drainage basin, leveraging GPS technology for precision. Thisarticle introduces a suite of hybrid machine learning predictive models, such as support-vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), logistic regression (LR), fuzzy logic (FL), and the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS). These models were strategically deployed to assess landslide susceptibility within the region. The outcomes of the landslide susceptibility assessment reveal that the main high susceptible zones for landslide occurrence are concentrated in the northwestern, northern, northeastern, and some southern and southeastern areas of the region. Moreover, when considering the implementation of predictions using different algorithms, it became evident that SVM exhibited superior performance regardingboth accuracy (0.89) and precision (0.89), followed by RF, with and accuracy of 0.83 and a precision of 0.83. However, it is noteworthy that TOPSIS yielded the lowest accuracy value among the algorithms assessed.					; Azarafza, Mohammad/AAP-2136-2020; Sabonchi, Arkan/KAM-4903-2024; SABONCHI, Arkan kh shakr/AAX-8403-2020	Mao, Yimin/0000-0002-6540-6971; SABONCHI, Arkan kh shakr/0000-0001-9970-1090; Azarafza, Mohammad/0000-0001-7777-3800														2073-4441				FEB	2024	16	3							380	10.3390/w16030380	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16030380													WOS:001160233200001

Results show that prokaryotic cells-in terms of abundance, shape, and size-change in relation with environmental changes. Prokaryotic abundance was high, where a strong condition of eutrophication was detected. Sizes of cells showed the prevalence of very small forms (> 0.1 mu m(3)), but larger morphotypes were observed in high trophic conditions (till 0.4 mu m(3)). In Antarctic marine systems, such prokaryotic parameters can be used to evaluate environment status.					azzaro, Maurizio/AAE-6784-2019; azzaro, maurizio/A-9559-2017	azzaro, maurizio/0000-0001-7885-2340; la ferla, rosabruna/0000-0003-1029-7349; AZZARO, FILIPPO/0000-0002-5194-3856													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2015	761	1					181	194		10.1007/s10750-015-2426-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2426-7													WOS:000362964400010

The non-indigenous species Corbicula flianinea (Muller, 1774) is one of the most invasive bivalves in freshwater ecosystems. This Asian clam was first reported in the River Minho estuary in 1989. After a short period of time, it became the major component of the local benthic fauna in terms of abundance and biomass. 2. In the autumn of 2004 and 2005, spatial and temporal variations in abundance, biomass and population structure of C. fluminea were investigated at 16 sites in the freshwater subtidal area of the River Minho estuary. Mean abundance and biomass per site ranged from 80 to 4185 ind. m(-2) and 8.5 to 465.9 g AFDW m(-2), respectively. 3. The environmental characterization of the area was performed through multivariate analysis, which revealed three distinct areas subjected to different abiotic conditions. C. fluminea population structure is well correlated with these three distinct areas. 4. The combination of several abiotic variables determining C. fluminea biomass distribution was evaluated through a stepwise multiple regression. This model showed that redox potential, nutrient concentrations, hardness, organic matter and sediment characteristics explained almost 60% of the variation in C. fluminea biomass in the freshwater subtidal area of the River Minho estuary (R-2 = 59.3%, F-[9,F-86] = 13.9, p < 0.001). 5. Improved ecological knowledge is essential for future C. fluminea management, in order to protect local habitats and biodiversity, and to reduce the economic impact of this non-indigenous invasive species.

By the end of the summer, i.e., 17 weeks after hatching, detected dispersion was mainly downstream and less than 1 km. Within this distance, three families that had been stocked together showed different patterns of dispersion, with the relative abundance of each family changing systematically with distance downstream from the nest, but with no monopolization of any area or habitat type by any one family. The length of fry also changed systematically with distance downstream, with the patterns of change depending on family. For each family, fry were larger closer to the nest. Changes in habitat type had a common effect on the density and length of fry from all the families.

The binary solvent system was used to improve the extraction efficiencies of all analytes in comparison to the single extraction solvents. A comprehensive univariate optimization was performed to determine optimum experimental conditions based on the type and amount of extraction and dispersive solvents, and mixing period. The optimum parameters obtained were binary solvent (100 mu L dichloromethane + 100 mu L 1,2-dichloroethane), 2.5 mL ethanol and 15 s of mixing by vortex. Under the optimum conditions, satisfactory analytical figures of merit were calculated for the analytes. The limits of detection (LODs) obtained for alachlor, nitrofen and bifenox were 0.30, 0.60 and 2.0 ng mL(-1), respectively. Spiked recovery experiments were carried out on dam lake, river and well water samples and the percent recoveries calculated fell within the range of 83-121%.

Analysis of Prey Selection by Double-Crested Cormorants: A 15-Year Diet Study in Oneida Lake, New York	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Piscivorous birds, in particular cormorants Phalacrocorax spp., have been reported to cause declines in some fish populations in both Europe and North America, but not in others. This difference may be due to prey selection by cormorants that is further dependent on the composition of the fish assemblage present. We present 15years of diet data collected from Oneida Lake, New York, where we have previously documented negative effects of double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus on two fish populations valued by anglers: Walleye Sander vitreus and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens. The Oneida Lake fish community changed through the study period and this change was reflected in cormorant diet samples. Diet samples were variable based on season and year with Emerald Shiner Notropis atherinoides, Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, Lepomis spp., Logperch Percina caprodes, Walleye, and Yellow Perch having the highest overall relative importance. In years when age-0 Gizzard Shad were abundant they dominated double-crested cormorant diets in the fall after the shad reached a length of 45mm. Consumption of Emerald Shiner and Gizzard Shad was positively related to each species' abundance, but no significant correlation between availability and consumption was found for Walleye, White Perch Morone americana, or Yellow Perch. Double-crested cormorants may be displaying prey-switching behavior and selecting for smaller, soft-rayed, prey species. We conclude that variation in fish recruitment influences double-crested cormorant food selection habits and highlight the importance of continued monitoring with changing fish communities to reliably assess potential impacts of cormorants on a fish community over time.

J	Safarudin; Moore, TC Jr				Safarudin; Moore, TC Jr			The history and architecture of lacustrine depositional systems in the northern Lake Michigan basin	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The post-glacial history of the Great Lakes has involved changes in lake levels that are equivalent in vertical extent to the Pleistocene changes in global sea level and changes in sediment accumulation by at least two orders of magnitude. In the sediments of the northern Lake Michigan basin, these radical changes in base level and sediment supply are preserved in detailed records of changing depositional environment and the impact of these changes on depositional architecture. The seismic sequences of the sediment fill previously described in Lake Huron have been carried into northern Lake Michigan and used to map the history and architecture of basinal deposition. As the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated northward in the early Holocene, it opened progressively deeper channels to the east that allowed the larger lakes to drain through the North Channel, Huron, and Georgian Bay basins. At the end of the Main Algonquin highstand, about 10,200 (radiocarbon) yrs ago, the eastern drainage passage deepened in a series of steps that defined four seismic sequences and lowered lake levels by over 100 m. Near the same time a new source of sediment and meltwaters poured across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and into the northern Lake Michigan basin from the Superior basin ice lobe. A marked increase in deposition is seen first in the northern part of the study area, and slightly later in the Whitefish Fan area at the southern end of the study area. Accumulation rates in the area gradually decreased even as lake levels continued to fall. Drainage directly from the Superior basin ended before the beginning of the main Mattawa phase about 9,200 (radiocarbon) yrs ago. Although individual lowstand systems tracts are at the most a few hundred yrs in duration, their geometries and seismic character are comparable to marine systems tracts associated with sea level falls of similar magnitudes. In some of the thicker lowstand deposits a second order cyclicity in sedimentation can be detected in the high resolution seismic records.

Two hundred and forty seven water samples were collected from the Gonghe East Basin, Gonghe West Basin and Chaka Basin. The three groundwater systems of Gonghe Basin from west to east display different geochemical signatures. Based on Na/Cl ratios and Langelier-Ludwig diagram, it is inferred that the groundwater recharge potential of the Gonghe East Basin is much prosperous than the other areas. The renewability of the aquifers in alluvial-proluvial fan of Wahonghe and Gonghe East Basin margin is much faster than in the other basins. The groundwater quality in Chaka Salt Lake, Shazhuyu and Qiabuqia River Valley plains is low due to strong evaporation and cation exchange. The groundwater quality of the phreatic aquifers in the Qiabuqia River Valley plain is further deteriorated by mixing of high-arsenic and high-mineralization water from the deep fault structures.

The mineral magnetic and textural analyses, along with chronology, distinctly record variation in the monsoon intensity since 15000 cal yrs BP in the sediment core collected from the Kanwar Lake in the Central Ganga Plain (CGP) of India. This unique high-resolution data allowed us to analyse monsoon fluctuation in the CGP with respect to changes in the North Atlantic process (internal) and external (solar cycles) forcing. During this period, several palaeoclimatic events, such as the B empty set lling-Aller empty setd (B/A), Older and Younger Dryas, and the high-frequency fluctuations in the Holocene viz., Greenlandian, Northgrippian, and Meghalayan stages, were observed. The B/A event is correlated with the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) intensification period of the CGP. Eleven dry events are recorded at 13600-13200, 13000-11700, 11000, 10600, 9800-9000, 8200, 6100-5300, 4300-4200, 3800, 1800-900 and 300 cal yrs BP. During the Holocene, the sustained episodes of weaker monsoon centered around 10600, 9600, 8200, 6000, 4200, 2800, 1400 and 600 cal yrs BP, where the variability of the proxy data is mostly synchronous with the reduced upwelling intensity in the western Arabian Sea as well as roughly align with similar to 1500 years cyclic signals in the drifted ice proxy recorded Bond Events indicating weakened ISM circulation during colder North Atlantic. Two distinct short cycles, spanning 172-344 and 172-688 years, are evident around 12,000 and 14,000 cal yrs BP with an additional occurrence from 86 to 344 years during 2000 and 6000 cal yrs BP, affirming the significance of external forcing, particularly solar activity. For the 1492 years cycle in ISM fluctuation, we postulate it may represent a combined forcing of external (solar) and internal (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)) factors during the Holocene. This is the first high-resolution record available in the CGP, which brings out crucial monsoon reconstruction during the last 15000 years.

The lake is located within an intermediate-altitude crater in Costa Rica, Central America. It has steep sides and reaches a maximum depth of 18.8 m. The lake has no surface outlet, nevertheless, its water has a low concentration of solutes, possibly because of rain fall and underground seepage. Water column stratification was observed in ail visits with a clinograde oxygen curve and anoxic conditions below 15 m. The Phytoplankton was composed mainly of small chlorophytes and other algae, with a total of 43 species. The diversity was low due to strong dominance of Arthrodesmus bifidus, and the Zooplankton, dominated by Tropocyclops prasinus prasinus, included four species of Cladocera. Large filter feeders were not observed which may partially explain dominance of small algae.

Good correspondence between the palaeo-vegetation and the sedimentological profile suggests that both records are mainly controlled by variations in the past climatic conditions. Periods of frequent coal deposition generally coincide with high abundance of thermophilous and xeric indicators suggesting warm and dry climate. Pollen and sediment records show two large-scale warming and shallowing-upward cycles and smaller-scale cyclicity. The high relative percentage of warn pollen taxa in the entire record, with Engelhardia as the main component, generally indicates a subtropical humid climate for this area during the early Middle Miocene, probably related to the Miocene Climatic Optimum. This study shows a response of the vegetation to climate change at short-term, probably related to orbital cyclic variations in summer insolation during the Middle Miocene. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Water quality improvement was expected from maintenance of farm village drainage and waterfront function was carried out for town activation in 1992. However, no blue-green algal bloom outbreak had occurred before. We studied the water quality and compositions of the zooplankton and phytoplankton before and after building a bulkhead maintenance construction. Large decreased values for NO3-N, NH4-N and NO2-N were 1.87 -> 0.50 gNm(-2) (26.7%), 1.49 -> 0.78 gNm(-2) (52.3%) and 0.085 -> 0.030 gNm(-2) (35.3%), respectively. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Cyanophyceae) were dominant in the summer; some species of the genus Fragilaria were dominant among phytoplankton during study periods. The dominant species of zooplankton during study periods were Keratella cochlearis (Rotatoria); smaller than Cyclops vicinus (Crustaceae) were dominant species of zooplankton before the construction.																			2186-2982	2186-2990				JUN	2016	10	22					1983	1988																WOS:000376281900004
J	Boucher, J; Weathers, KC; Norouzi, H; Steele, B				Boucher, Jonah; Weathers, Kathleen C.; Norouzi, Hamid; Steele, Bethel			Assessing the effectiveness of Landsat 8 chlorophyll a retrieval algorithms for regional freshwater monitoring	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Predicting algal blooms has become a priority for scientists, municipalities, businesses, and citizens. Remote sensing offers solutions to the spatial and temporal challenges facing existing lake research and monitoring programs that rely primarily on high-investment, in situ measurements. Techniques to remotely measure chlorophyll a (chl a) as a proxy for algal biomass have been limited to specific large water bodies in particular seasons and narrow chl a ranges. Thus, a first step toward prediction of algal blooms is generating regionally robust algorithms using in situ and remote sensing data. This study explores the relationship between in-lake measured chl a data from Maine and New Hampshire, USA lakes and remotely sensed chl a retrieval algorithm outputs. Landsat 8 images were obtained and then processed after required atmospheric and radiometric corrections. Six previously developed algorithms were tested on a regional scale on 11 scenes from 2013 to 2015 covering 192 lakes. The best performing algorithm across data from both states had a 0.16 correlation coefficient (R-2) and P <= 0.05 when Landsat 8 images within 5 d, and improved to R-2 of 0.25 when data from Maine only were used. The strength of the correlation varied with the specificity of the time window in relation to the in-situ sampling date, explaining up to 27% of the variation in the data across several scenes. Two previously published algorithms using Landsat 8's Bands 1-4 were best correlated with chl a, and for particular late-summer scenes, they accounted for up to 69% of the variation in in-situ measurements. A sensitivity analysis revealed that a longer time difference between in situ measurements and the satellite image increased uncertainty in the models, and an effect of the time of year on several indices was demonstrated. A regional model based on the best performing remote sensing algorithm was developed and was validated using independent in situ measurements and satellite images. These results suggest that, despite challenges including seasonal effects and low chl a thresholds, remote sensing could be an effective and accessible regional-scale tool for chl a monitoring programs in lakes.

However, the importance of the lakes as a temporary site for migrant bird populations has not been adequately studied. The point count method was used to study waterbird species diversity and abundance in Lake Ashenge, in the semi-arid region of northern Ethiopia, with the main aim to underscore the lake's importance as a stop-over site for Palaearctic and other migratory birds. A total of 36 species belonging to 14 waterbird families were encountered. Fifteen of the species were resident birds, including the endemic Wattled Ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), and 14 of the species were Palaearctic migrants, including the globally Near-Threatened Ferruginous Duck (Ayithya nyroca) and Maccoa Duck (Oxyura maccoa). Significant temporal variation in diversity and abundance was observed during the study period; diversity was highest (Shannon-Wiener H' = 1.98) in the dry season (December/January) and lowest (H' = 1.11) in the rainy season (August/September), whereas mean abundance was highest (c. 4219 individuals) in the post-rainy season (October/November) and lowest (c. 2631 individuals) in the dry season. Increased abundance of Palaearctic species towards the dry season increased species diversity, but may have caused displacement of resident birds resulting in lower overall abundance in this season. This study provides a new distributional record for Maccoa Duck, highlights the significance of the lake for several waterbird species and calls for its protection.					; Meheretu, Yonas/AAQ-8265-2021; null, Kiros Welegerima/NAX-5163-2025	, Kiros Welegerima/0000-0002-5871-0019; Meheretu, Yonas/0000-0002-5406-1672; 													2410-7220	2410-8200				APR	2017	47	1					1	9		10.3957/056.047.0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3957/056.047.0001													WOS:000399234700001

Five long drill cores of lacustrine sediments at Tulelake, northern California, recovered a nearly continuous 331-m-thick record spanning the past 3 m.y. The Brunhes Normal-Polarity, Matuyama Reversed-Polarity, and Gauss Normal-Polarity Chronozones are recognized; within these, the Jaramillo, Olduvai, Reunion(?), and Kaena(?) Subchronozones are present. Six short stratigraphic intervals exhibit anomalous remanent inclinations that may record excursions and brief subchrons within the Brunhes and Matuyama Chronozones. Age estimates suggest correlation of five of the anomalous intervals with (1) one of the Biwa excursions at about 18,000 yr B.P., (2) the Mono Lake excursion at about 27,000 yr B.P., (3) the Blake Reversed-Polarity Subchron at about 114,000 yr B.P., (4) the Kamikatsura Normal-Polarity Subchron at about 850,000 yr B.P., and (5) the Cobb Mountain Normal-Polarity Subchron at about 1.10 Ma. Age of the sixth interval of anomalous inclination is broadly constrained between 117,000 and 180,000 yr B.P. Sixty-three individual tephra layers were characterized by electron-microprobe and X-ray fluorescence analyses of volcanic glass shards. Identified tephra of relatively well known age include (1) the basal airfall pumice at Llao Rock, 7015 yr B.P.; (2) the Trego Hot Springs Bed, 23,400 yr B.P.; (3) the Olema ash bed, between 55,000 and 75,000 yr B.P.; (4) the airfall pumice at Cloudcap Road ("Pumice Castle-like tephra 2"), about 120,000 yr B.P.; (5) the Rockland ash bed, about 410,000 yr B.P.; (6) the Lava Creek-B ash bed, 620,000 yr B.P.; (7) the Rio Dell ash bed, about 1.45 Ma; and (8) the Bear Gulch ash bed, about 1.9 Ma. A sedimentation-rate curve based on independently dated tephra and polarity reversals is used to infer age estimates of undated or previously unidentified ash beds. Some of these ash beds are found over large areas of the western United States and eastern Pacific Ocean basin and provide widespread horizons for correlation. Most of the tephra at Tulelake records eruptions from the nearby southern and central Cascade Range of Oregon and northern California, and the Medicine Lake Highland of northern California. Deposition took place during most of the past 3 m.y. within the Tulelake basin; notable periods of slow or sporadic accumulation, or erosion, occurred between about 620,000 and 200,000 yr B.P. and between about 2.5 and 2.1 Ma. Rapid deposition occurred during marine oxygen-isotope stage 6, between about 170 and 125 ka. Regional volcanism during the past 3 m.y. was markedly episodic, with notable volcanic activity from about 2.1 to 1.9 Ma and from 0.4 Ma to the present.																			0016-7606					APR	1992	104	4					409	428		10.1130/0016-7606(1992)104<0409:MATOAU>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1992)104<0409:MATOAU>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992HL91000003

M.			LakeMIP Kivu: evaluating the representation of a large, deep tropical lake by a set of one-dimensional lake models	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The African great lakes are of utmost importance for the local economy (fishing), as well as being essential to the survival of the local people. During the past decades, these lakes experienced fast changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and their future evolution is a major concern. In this study, for the first time a set of one-dimensional lake models are evaluated for Lake Kivu (2.28 degrees S; 28.98 degrees E), East Africa. The unique limnology of this meromictic lake, with the importance of salinity and subsurface springs in a tropical high-altitude climate, presents a worthy challenge to the seven models involved in the Lake Model Intercomparison Project (LakeMIP). Meteorological observations from two automatic weather stations are used to drive the models, whereas a unique dataset, containing over 150 temperature profiles recorded since 2002, is used to assess the model's performance. Simulations are performed over the freshwater layer only (60 m) and over the average lake depth (240 m), since salinity increases with depth below 60 m in Lake Kivu and some lake models do not account for the influence of salinity upon lake stratification. All models are able to reproduce the mixing seasonality in Lake Kivu, as well as the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the lake enthalpy change. Differences between the models can be ascribed to variations in the treatment of the radiative forcing and the computation of the turbulent heat fluxes. Fluctuations in wind velocity and solar radiation explain inter-annual variability of observed water column temperatures. The good agreement between the deep simulations and the observed meromictic stratification also shows that a subset of models is able to account for the salinity- and geothermal-induced effects upon deep-water stratification. Finally, based on the strengths and weaknesses discerned in this study, an informed choice of a one-dimensional lake model for a given research purpose becomes possible.

Therefore, we installed automatic measurement systems with Vaisala CARBOCAP CO2 probes (Vaisala Oyj, Vantaa, Finland) in the riparian zone soil matrix around a small headwater lake, in the lake itself, and in the out flowing brook and followed the seasonal and diurnal variation in CO2 concentration as well as rain event-driven changes in this natural-state soil-lake-brook continuum in Southern Finland. Seasonal variation was greatest and concentrations highest deep in the soil and in the lake, but were also noticeable in the brook. On the other hand, diurnal variation was highest in shallow soil layers and the lake surface. In the brook, the influence of the riparian zone superseded that of the lake at less than 150 m distance, which resulted in wider variation and higher concentrations of CO2 . After the rain event, the normal diurnal pattern was changed, and the CO2 concentration in the soil increased as water filled the soil pores and slowed down the diffusion. Even though the water with lower CO2 concentration from the lake diluted the CO2 concentration in the brook, the input from the soil dominated the flow after the rain and concentrations increased. On an annual basis, the flow of terrestrial dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into the aquatic ecosystem was 1-13% of terrestrial net ecosystem production (NEP).

J	Schulz, DJ				Schulz, David J.			Troy D. Zars: a personal tribute to a scientist, colleague, and friend	JOURNAL OF NEUROGENETICS												I knew Troy for nearly 15 years, and in that time I don't recall hearing any childhood stories like those in seemingly every personal statement I've read from aspiring scientists or medical students. No stories about hours spent gazing at an anthill. I don't recall hearing about shelves crowded with insects collected on Styrofoam, or animal skulls kept in a shoebox under his bed. If these collected crania existed, it was more likely because Troy was a crack shot with a pellet gun than a need to know adaptations in the dentition of local squirrel populations. I don't recall hearing about science projects taken to the Iowa State Capitol to share with politely interested legislators. But I do recall hearing about spending the entirety of the daylight hours in the summer, with his brother Doug, finding where the crappie were biting. About crystal clear water on a lake in Minnesota that you didn't quite need to know the exact location of, just in case you were thinking of going and plundering the walleye within. I definitely heard about triumphs as a starting lineman not only for his high school football team, but the mighty Norse of Luther College. I heard about summer warehouse jobs in sweltering Iowa Julys. And I saw, firsthand, love and commitment and family. Troy's story demonstrates that the finest scientists are not just cultivated in narrow STEM curricula that begin at age 5. They are just as likely to be football-playing fishermen, fathers, husbands, and friends who can navigate an operant conditioning paradigm during the week, and dance a polka and produce a magnificent smoked pork shoulder on Saturday. Nature and an independent spirit and a little bit of mischief is a different kind of Magnet school. And it gave us truly one of the best.																			0167-7063	1563-5260				JAN 2	2020	34	1			SI		5	8		10.1080/01677063.2020.1713118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01677063.2020.1713118								32233837					WOS:000522835600003

Effects of feeding regimes and early maturation on migratory behaviour of landlocked hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The migratory behaviour of hatchery-reared landlocked Atlantic salmon Salmo salar raised under three different feeding regimes was monitored through the lower part of the River Klaralven, Sweden. The smolts were implanted with acoustic transmitters and released into the River Klaralven, 25 km upstream of the outlet in Lake Vanern. Early mature males, which had matured the previous autumn, were also tagged and released. Tomonitormigration of the fish, acoustic receivers were deployed along the migratory route. The proportion of S. salar that reached Lake Vanern was significantly greater for fish fed fat-reduced feed than for fish given rations with higher fat content, regardless of ration size. Fish from the early mature male group remained in the river to a greater extent than fish from the three feeding regimes. Smolt status (degree of silvering), as visually assessed, did not differ among the feeding regime groups, and moreover, fully-silvered fish, regardless of feeding regime, migrated faster and had a greater migration success than fish with less developed smolt characteristics. Also, successful migrants had a lower condition factor than unsuccessful ones. These results indicate that the migration success of hatchery-reared S. smolts released to the wild can be enhanced by relatively simple changes in feeding regimes and by matching stocking time with smolt development.

In 2019 and 2020, pollinators were sampled using pan-traps in three landscape types: Crop field margins, Perennial hayfields, and Natural habitats. Bee and hoverfly populations were dominated by a few species throughout the study area. Crop field margins contained greater floral availability and attracted more individuals and species of bees than other landscape types. Although hoverflies were not affected by either land-use type or flooding, the abundance and species richness of bees appeared to be reduced when spring flooding lasted longer, suggesting a mortality effect of flooding on their populations. Implications for insect conservation Our results make a case for the key role of field margins in the conservation of pollinating insects in agricultural landscapes, especially in a floodplain context.					; Watson, Christopher/M-6856-2013	Proulx, Raphael/0000-0002-9188-9225; McCune, Frederic/0000-0002-2710-6580; Watson, Christopher/0000-0003-3320-431X													1366-638X	1572-9753				DEC	2022	26	6					919	932		10.1007/s10841-022-00437-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-022-00437-9		NOV 2022											WOS:000878470400001

On the Upper Nelson River, station flows at Jenpeg Generating Station are reduced during freeze-up to promote formation of a smooth ice cover in often turbulent upstream areas. This ice cover reduces the risk of frazil generation, which could otherwise result in blockages and subsequent energy losses. In this study, a characterization of freeze-up conditions for the Upper Nelson River is presented through 15 years of historical observations, supplemented by a short-term detailed monitoring program (2015-2018). Observations of rapid leading edge celerity are associated with increased ice production under dampened hydraulic conditions. Analysis of ice cores and drone footage highlights the role of skim ice runs in early cover formation, while predictions of skim ice formation show agreement with ice floe taxonomy from the literature. Establishing a baseline of freeze-up conditions for the region will assist in the development of predictive tools, such as numerical models, to optimize flow control decisions for this significant hydropower system.

Tracing the active genetic diversity of Microcystis and Microcystis phage through a temporal survey of Taihu	PLOS ONE												Harmful algal blooms are commonly thought to be dominated by a single genus, but they are not homogenous communities. Current approaches, both molecular and culture-based, often overlook fine-scale variations in community composition that can influence bloom dynamics. We combined homology-based searches (BLASTX) and phylogenetics to distinguish and quantify Microcystis host and phage members across a summer season during a 2014 Microcystis- dominated bloom that occurred in Lake Tai (Taihu), China. We found 47 different genotypes of the Microcystis-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rpoB), which included several morphospecies. Microcystis flos-aquae and Microcystis wesenbergii accounted for similar to 86% of total Microcystis transcripts, while the more commonly studied Microcystis aeruginosa only accounted for similar to 7%. Microcystis genotypes were classified into three temporal groups according to their expression patterns across the course of the bloom: early, constant and late. All Microcystis morphospecies were present in each group, indicating that expression patterns were likely dictated by competition driven by environmental factors, not phylogeny. We identified three primary Microcystis-infecting phages based on the viral terminase, including a novel Siphoviridae phage that may be capable of lysogeny. Within our dataset, Myoviridae phages consistent with those infecting Microcystis in a lytic manner were positively correlated to the early host genotypes, while the Siphoviridae phages were positively correlated to the late host genotypes, when the Myoviridae phages express putative genetic markers for lysogeny. The expression of genes in the microcystin-encoding mcy cassette was estimated using mcyA, which revealed 24 Microcystis-specific genotypes that were negatively correlated to the early host genotypes. Of all environmental factors measured, pH best described the temporal shift in the Microcystis community genotypic composition, promoting hypotheses regarding carbon concentration mechanisms and oxidative stress. Our work expounds on the complexity of HAB events, using a well-studied dataset to highlight the need for increased resolution of community dynamics.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008	Pound, Helena/0000-0002-6505-9789; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077													1932-6203					DEC 28	2020	15	12							e0244482	10.1371/journal.pone.0244482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244482								33370358					WOS:000603611900026

J	WASHBURN, JO; CORNELL, HV				WASHBURN, JO; CORNELL, HV			PARASITOIDS, PATCHES, AND PHENOLOGY - THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE LOCAL EXTINCTION OF A CYNIPID GALL WASP POPULATION	ECOLOGY												The cynipid gall wasp Xanthoteras politum (Bassett) and its associated chalcid and inquiline parasitoid community were studied from 1976-1978 at a postfire site near Lake Oswego in the New Jersey (USA) Pine Barrens. X. politum and 2 other cynipid species selectively attacked new sucker shoots growing from larger fire-damaged trees. Chalcid and inquiline parasitoid attack was the major mortality factor in the population in all 3 yr. In each successive year a higher frequency of the host population was killed by parasitoid attack, and by 1978 only 76 host galls occurred at the site. Inquiline cynipids were minor parasitoid elements in the 1st yr of the gall outbreak, but dominated the parasitoid guild in subsequent seasons. Their dominance is attributed to 2 major factors: they attack galls earlier than other parasitoids, and those galls attacked remained at a smaller size and were not chosen for oviposition by later arriving chalcids. Inquilines did not emerge in spring and infest other gall species as did the chalcid parasitoids. These inquilines remained in the leaf litter and reinfested the next asexual generation of X. politum which appeared on trees in mid-July. The parasitoid community displayed neither strong stability nor consistent composition. The apparent overexploitation of the host population by parasitoids may be to their selective advantage as phenological changes in host plants eventually eliminate X. politum from postfire sites.

Twenty-five ponds were sampled in four distinct geographic locations, including the Lower and Upper Wright Valleys, Ross Island and the McMurdo Ice Shelf. For morphological identification, benthic mat samples were thawed and a subsample was directly observed by light microscopy. Remaining sample material was stored in 50 ml sterile polycarbonate bottles containing the mineral nutrient medium MLA for future studies, maintained at a temperature of 21 degrees C. Ten morphological criteria were used to describe the morphotypes (trichome shape, number of trichomes in sheath, presence or absence of terminal attenuation of trichome, calyptra on mature apical cell, shape of apical cell, presence or absence of constrictions at transverse walls, granules, branching, range in width of trichomes and range of cell length) with reference to available identification literature. All morphospecies were documented using photomicrography. In total, 29 morphospecies were described, four assigned to the order Chroococcales, three to Nostocales and 22 to Oscillatoriales. The four geographic locations had similar taxonomic richness, sharing many morphospecies. However, each also contained distinct floristic elements that were rare or absent from the others.					; Schaefer, Carlos/AAY-4977-2020	Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; 													0001-3765	1678-2690					2022	94			1					e20210814	10.1590/0001-3765202220210814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202220210814								35442301					WOS:000798819200001

Calcareous root tubes (CRTs), a form of pedogenic carbonate, are widely distributed in the hinterland of the Tengger Desert, Northwest China. The investigations of delta C-13 and delta O-18 values within CRTs from the Tengger Desert have a great potential to provide new significant archives for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in this area. In this study, 30 CRT samples from the Tengger Desert were collected. All the samples were described using cathodoluminescence (CL), and their delta C-13 and delta O-18 values were measured. The results revealed that limited marine carbonate was incorporated in the CRTs in the Tengger Desert and delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the inner belt of the CRTs were not affected by recrystallization. Therefore, delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the CRTs could accurately record environmental conditions in the Tengger Desert. The carbon source of the CRTs was a mixture of soil CO2 derived from root respiration and atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, delta C-13 values of most samples were lower than - 3.0%, indicating that C-3 vegetation was the main vegetation in the Tengger Desert during the middle and late Holocene. Moreover, delta O-18 values of the CRTs were ultimately inherited from summer precipitation. Influenced by the 'amount effect' in summer and strong evaporation, the lower delta O-18 values of the CRTs revealed that relatively higher effective moisture occurred from 7 to 4 cal kyr BP while the higher delta O-18 values indicated that relatively lower effective moisture occurred from 4 to 2 cal kyr BP in the Tengger Desert. The Holocene millennial-scale moisture changes in the hinterland of the Tengger Desert suggest an arid early Holocene (11.7-7 cal kyr BP), a relatively humid mid-Holocene (7-4 cal kyr BP), and a humid to arid late Holocene (4-2 cal kyr BP). The discrepancy of effective moisture change reconstruction based on the CRTs in the Tengger Desert and adjacent lake sediments during the early Holocene demonstrated that the reliability of the reconstructed results from lake sediments during this period needs further investigation.					; Li, Zhuolun/GYE-1649-2022	Li, Zhuolun/0000-0003-4164-8551; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2020	195								104846	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104846													WOS:000580366300066

Terminal Doppler Weather Radar Retrievals in Complex Terrain during a Summer High Ozone Period	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Out of the 45 radars composing the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) network, 21 are located in areas of complex terrain. Their mission to observe low-level wind shear at major airports prone to strong shear-induced accidents puts them in an ideal position to fill critical boundary layer observation gaps within the NEXRAD network in these regions. Retrievals such as velocity azimuth display and velocity volume processing (VVP) are used to create time- height profiles fi les of the boundary layer from radar conical scans, but assume that a wide area around the radar is horizontally homogeneous. This assumption is rarely met in regions of complex terrain. This paper introduces a VVP retrieval with limited radius to make these profiling fi ling techniques informative for flows affected by topography. These retrievals can be applied to any operational radar to help examine critical boundary layer processes. VVP retrievals were derived from the TDWR for Salt Lake City International Airport, TSLC, during a summertime high ozone period. These observations highlighted thermally driven circulations and variations in boundary layer depth at high vertical and temporal resolution and provided insight on their influence fluence on air quality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Residents in many urban areas of the United States are exposed to elevated ozone concentrations during the summer months. In complex terrain, thermally driven circulations and terrain-forced flows affect chemical processes by modulating mixing and transport. A novel technique to monitor local boundary layer conditions on small horizontal length scales was applied to data from the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar located near Salt Lake City International Airport during a multiday high ozone event, and effects of these flows on ozone concentrations are illustrated. This technique can be applied to other operational weather radars to create long-term and realtime records of near-surface processes at high vertical and temporal resolution.																			0739-0572	1520-0426				OCT	2024	41	10					909	920		10.1175/JTECH-D-23-0162.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-23-0162.1													WOS:001337630600001

Monitoring decadal lake dynamics across the Yangtze Basin downstream of Three Gorges Dam	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Yangtze River Basin downstream of China's Three Gorges Dam (TGD) (thereafter referred to as "downstream" basin) hosts the largest cluster of freshwater lakes in East Asia. These lakes are crucial water stocks to local biophysical environments and socioeconomic development. Existing studies document that individual lakes in this region have recently experienced dramatic changes under the context of enduring meteorological drought, continuous population growth, and extensive water regulation since TGD's initial impoundment (i.e., June, 2003). However, spatial and temporal patterns of lake dynamics across the complete downstream Yangtze basin remain poorly characterized. Using daily MODIS imagery and an advanced thematic mapping scheme, this study presents a comprehensive monitoring of area dynamics in the downstream lake system at a 10-day temporal resolution during 2000-2011. The studied lakes constitute similar to 76% (similar to 11,400 km(2)) of the total downstream lake area, including the entire + 70 major lakes larger than 20 km2. The results reveal a decadal net decline in lake inundation area across the downstream Yangtze Basin, with a cumulative decrease of 849 km(2) or 7.4% from 2000 to 2011. Despite an excessive precipitation anomaly in the year 2010, the decreasing trend was tested significant in all seasons. The most substantial decrease in the post-TGD period appears in fall (1.1% yr(-1)), which intriguingly coincides with the TGD water storage season. Regional lake dynamics exhibit contrasting spatial patterns, manifested as evident decrease and increase of aggregated lake areas respectively within and beyond the Yangtze Plain. This contrast suggests a marked vulnerability of lakes in the Yangtze Plain, to not only local meteorological variability but also intensified human water regulations from both the upstream Yangtze main stem (e.g., the TGD) and tributaries (e.g., lakes/reservoirs beyond the Yangtze Plain). The produced lake mapping result and derived lake area dynamics across the downstream Yangtze Basin provides a crucial monitoring basis for continuous investigations of changing mechanisms in the Yangtze lake system.

J	JACKSON, LJ; RASMUSSEN, JB; KALFF, J				JACKSON, LJ; RASMUSSEN, JB; KALFF, J			A MASS-BALANCE ANALYSIS OF TRACE-METALS IN 2 WEEDBEDS	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A mass-balance approach was used to examine the role of macrophyte beds as a sink or source for 7 metals over time scales varying from two months (the growing season of the plants) to one year. During the growing season the macrophyte beds were found to be net sinks for particulate metals but were net sources of dissolved metals. During senescence, ca. 15-20% of the Al, Fe, and Mn and ca. 25-30% of the Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn within the macrophyte tissues at maximum seasonal biomass was lost to the surrounding waters in a dissolved form. The export of metals from the weeds during senescence was a very small fraction (<0.01% of Al, Fe to 3.5% of Zn) of the annual allochthonous metal loading to Fitch Bay in L. Memphremagog, Quebec. In L. Weedon however, metal export during senescence was 34% (Mn) to 57%(Cu) of the annual allochthonous load. The time estimated for the plants to recycle the metals within the rooting zone of the sediments was on the order of hundreds of years. These results demonstrate that while weedbeds are net sources of metals during the summer, only a small fraction of metals in littoral sediments are not permanently buried over the longer term.																			0049-6979					MAY	1994	75	1-2					107	119		10.1007/BF01100403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01100403													WOS:A1994NL60200008

We measured CH4 and CO2 fluxes at high temporal (hourly) and spatial resolution (approx. 13 m) using 24 automatic floating chambers equipped with continuously recording sensors that enabled the determination of diffusive and ebullitive gas fluxes. Additionally, wemeasured potential drivers such as weather patterns, water temperature, and O-2 above the sediment. During five days in autumn 2021, we conducted measurements at 88 sites in a small, shallow eutrophic Danish Lake. CH4 ebullition was intense (mean 54.8 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and showed pronounced spatiotemporal variation. Ebullition rates were highest in deeper, hypoxicwater (5-7m). Diffusive CH4 fluxes were 4-fold lower (mean 15.0 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and spatially less variable than ebullitive fluxes, and significantly lower above hard sediments and submergedmacrophyte stands. CO2 concentration in surface waters was permanently supersaturated at the mid-lake station, and diffusive fluxes (mean 919 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) tended to be higher from deeper waters and increased with wind speed. To obtain mean whole-lake fluxes within an uncertainty of 20 %, we estimated that 72 sites for CH4 ebullition, 39 sites for diffusive CH4 fluxes and 27 sites for diffusive CO2 fluxes would be required. Thus, accurate whole-lake quantification of the dominant ebullitive CH4 flux requires simultaneous operation of many automated floating chambers. High spatiotemporal variability challenges the identification of essential drivers and current methods for upscaling lake CH4 and CO2 fluxes. We successfully overcame this challenge by using automatic floating chambers, which offer continuous CH4 and CO2 flux measurements at high temporal resolution and, thus, are an improvement over existing approaches.					; Polauke, Emma/KHW-6541-2024; Sø, Jonas Stage/HPD-5343-2023	Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571; So, Jonas Stage/0000-0002-3222-3706; Polauke, Emma Ditte Rohmann/0009-0006-6486-2621; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 20	2023	878								162895	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162895		MAR 2023						36958559					WOS:000971937600001
J	Massé, H; Rochefort, L; Gauthier, G				Massé, H; Rochefort, L; Gauthier, G			Carrying capacity of wetland habitats used by breeding greater snow geese	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Because geese can damage their arctic breeding habitats through overgrazing, there is debate about limiting the rapid growth of the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica) population and setting a population goal. To answer these questions, we assessed the nutritional carrying capacity of freshwater wetland habitats for breeding greater snow geese at the Bylot Island colony, Nunavut, Canada. Specifically: we (1) mapped the different types of wetlands on the island: (2) estimated net aboveground primary production of these habitats; (3) compared total food availability with predicted total food requirements of the current population; and (4) validated our predictions of plant biomass consumed by comparing them to the intensity of goose grazing measured. Freshwater wetlands represented 173 =/- 6 km(2) or 11% of the total area of the south plain of Bylot Island. Streams and wet polygons were the most important habitats in terms of availability of suitable forage plants for geese. The average net aboveground primary production ranged from 21.0 +/- 4.6 along lakes to 46.0 +/- 9.8 g/m(2) in polygon channels, We estimated the total food supply available for geese in wetlands at 2,625 +/- 461 tons in 1997 but only 1,247 +/- 473 tons in 1996, a year of low plant production. We predicted a summer food requirement for goslings at 8.1 +/- 0.6 kg/bird, for breeding adults at 7.9 +/- 2.3. and for nonbreeding adults at 4.7 +/- 1.5, and we predicted the total summer food requirements of the goose population at 1,201 +/- 160 tons. The predicted amount of biomass removed (32 +/- 7%) agreed well with the actual amount of biomass removed measured in mid-August (39 +/- 11%) in 1997, but not in 1996 (67 +/- 27% vs 26 +/- 17%, respectively), possibly because the goose population was lower that yt ar due to poor breeding success. In 1997, the goose population was at 46 +/- 10% of the theoretical short-term earning capacity (341,000 geese) of the wetlands of Bylot Island. We recommend keeping the goose population below this theoretical carrying capacity.

J	HADAS, O; PINKAS, R				HADAS, O; PINKAS, R			SULFATE REDUCTION PROCESSES IN SEDIMENTS AT DIFFERENT SITES IN LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Lake Kinneret, Israel, is a warm (13-30 degrees C) monomictic lake that stratifies in April and turns over in December. Between January and June each year, a heavy bloom (up to 250 g wet weight m(-2)) of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense dominates the phytoplankton biomass. In early summer, the bloom collapses, and the sinking Peridinium biomass serves as a trigger for intense sulfate-reduction activity throughout the hypolimnion and within the sediments. The availability of organic matter and sulfate was high shortly after the bloom crash and the beginning of stratification and was lowest in December before overturn. Sulfate-reduction rates at three different sites in the lake were studied. In the sediments, the rates varied seasonally and among stations from 5 to 1600 nmol SO4-2 reduced cm(-3) day(-1), with respect to the distance from the Jordan River, depth, organic content, and stratification period. During years of low lake water levels, intense sulfate reduction occurred in the hypolimnion, resulting in anoxia and high concentrations of H2S (>400 mu M). In years with high water levels, early bloom, and delayed stratification, higher rates of sulfate reduction were recorded in the sediments, probably as a result of a greater fraction of the primary production (organic matter) reaching the bottom.																			0095-3628					JUL-AUG	1995	30	1					55	66											24185412					WOS:A1995RF81800005

New insights into Holocene atmospheric circulation dynamics in central Scandinavia inferred from oxygen-isotope records of lake-sediment cellulose	BOREAS												Cellulose-inferred lakewater oxygen-isotope records have been obtained from two hydrologically open basins (Lake Spaime and Lake Svartkalstjarn), located on a west east transect across central Sweden, to investigate changes in atmospheric circulation patterns during the Holocene. The Lake Spaime delta O-18 record is sensitive to changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation in the Scandes Mountains of west-central Sweden, and thus generally portrays variations in delta O-18 of precipitation (delta O-18(P)) that are governed predominantly by the influence of air masses originating from the North Atlantic. In contrast, the Lake Svartkalstjarn delta O-18 record appears to reflect the varying influence of air masses delivering moisture from the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. A comparison of inferred changes in delta O-18(P) over the Holocene between the two sites reveals systematic patterns of variability over widely different time scales. These include: (1) a previously recognized long-term regional decline in delta O-18(P), possibly in response to the declining vigour of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation related to decreasing summer solar insolation; (2) newly identified inverse centennial- to millennial-scale delta O-18(P) fluctuations at the two sites that may be linked to changes in modes of atmospheric circulation analogous to those described at interannual to multidecadal time scales by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index; and (3) a prolonged interval of apparent climatic stability in the mid-Holocene (c. 6300-4200 cal. yr BP) characterized by persistently negative NAO-like circulation.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008	Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2010	39	4					770	782		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00169.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00169.x													WOS:000282223100010
J	Lin, P; Klump, JV; Guo, LD				Lin, Peng; Klump, J. Val; Guo, Laodong			Dynamics of dissolved and particulate phosphorus influenced by seasonal hypoxia in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Despite major investments in point source reductions, portions of the Great Lakes, like Green Bay, remain hypereutrophic and are subject to persistent seasonal hypoxia. Phosphorus (P) is generally a limiting nutrient in the Great Lakes ecosystem, but not all P species are equally bioavailable, and the dynamics of nutrients and their correlation to algal bloom remain poorly characterized, in part, due to a lack of adequate quantification of P chemical speciation. During summer 2014, water samples were collected from seasonally hypoxic Green Bay for measurements of dissolved and particulate inorganic and organic P to examine P cycling dynamics along a steep nutrient gradient ranging from Fox River inflow dominated eutrophic waters in the southern bay to mesotrophic northern waters near the bay's connection with open Lake Michigan. River-derived dissolved and particulate P was quickly removed from the water column in southern Green Bay through biological uptake and sedimentation. Concentrations of phosphate or dissolved inorganic P (DIP) dramatically decreased from 828 +/- 216 nM in the Fox River, comprising 57 +/- 1% of the total dissolved P, to 24 +/- 9 nM in northern Green Bay where dissolved organic P (DOP) became predominant (>80%). Generally low phosphate concentrations and extremely high dissolved organic C/P ratios (2090 +/- 1160 in August 2014) suggested high DOP turnover rates and active transformation between DOP and DIP through organic degradation during P-limited conditions in Green Bay. Elevated DIP levels were accompanied by low dissolved oxygen in deeper waters (10-15 m) of central Green Bay where hypoxia-development occurred, suggesting the release of DIP through particle regeneration under hypoxic conditions enhanced by lateral transport and sediment resuspension. High partition coefficients (K-d) of both inorganic and organic P and their significant negative correlation with suspended particulate matter concentrations indicated the particle-reactive nature of P in freshwater environments and may imply that DOP could also be bioavailable under P-limitation.

However, little is known about the role of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation in affecting nitrogen removal efficiency. This study investigated how cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation affects the efficiency, at which a CW removes nitrogen from an associated artificial lake (AL) in Beijing. For this purpose, we measured cell densities of N-fixing and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria, the aquatic nitrogen fixation rate (R-Nfix), and the concentration of various nitrogen fractions over the growing season (April-November) of 2014 in both AL and CW. We found that the removal of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) contributed to >90% of the total nitrogen removal in the CW. The removal efficiency of PON was lower during August-October (55.45 +/- 27.49%) than during April-July (68.86 +/- 8.83%). Phytoplankton proliferation in summer, as one of the main sources of PON, may have exceeded the capacity of the CW and led to declines in PON removal efficiency. R-Nfix peaked in July-October (3-169 ng N.L-1.h(-1)) and was positively correlated with both PON concentration and the cell density of N-fixing Anabaena sp. over the growing season, suggesting that aquatic nitrogen fixation (primarily in the AL) may increase PON and thereby reduce the its removal efficiency in the CW.

Thereby, we analyzed various samples collected along the Han River and from its surrounding areas (South Korea, n = 34). The OH-GDGTs were found in all samples investigated. OH-GDGT-0 was the dominant OH-GDGT component in the estuary and marine samples while OH-GDGT-2 was generally dominant in the soils, the lake sediments and the river suspended particulate matter (SPM). Our results thus suggests a possible warm bias of the RI-OH-derived summer SSTs in the coastal zone to which a large amount of terrestrial organic matter is being supplied. Further studies are necessary to better assess the applicability of the RI-OH proxy in the eastern Yellow Sea.					; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/AAD-6999-2021	Shin, Kyung-Hoon/0000-0002-3169-4274; 													2096-0956	2365-7499				SEP	2017	36	3			SI		367	369		10.1007/s11631-017-0165-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-017-0165-3													WOS:000414376100005

One conventional paradigm states that the magnitude of internal loading through P diffusion is constrained by the presence of iron (Fe) oxides in surface sediments under oxic conditions near the sediment-water interface (SWI). However, biogeochemical P dynamics in Fe-rich sedimentary systems are still not fully understood, especially in eutrophic lakes where intensively coupled organic matter (OM) remineralization and reductive dissolution of Fe-bound P (Fe-P) exist concurrently. Here, we assess the diagenetic processes that govern sedimentary P cycling in two eutrophic Fe-rich lakes in southern Finland, Lake Hiidenvesi and Lake Kytajarvi, using a combination of porewater and solid-phase analyses. Coupled reductive dissolution of Fe-P and OM remineralization controlled P regeneration in both lakes, with Fe-P acting as the dominant source for porewater P. Vivianite formation likely immobilized sedimentary P in the deepest basin of Hiidenvesi. Elevated P diffusion rates were observed at shallow sites under oxic bottom water conditions in summer in both lakes, stimulated by enhanced remineralization of both freshly- (mostly phytoplankton-origin) and earlier-deposited OM under elevated temperatures. Areas overlain by oxic bottom water contributed more benthic P fluxes to the water column compared to anoxic/hypoxic areas in both lakes during all sampling seasons. Our study suggests that in shallow eutrophic settings with high OM deposition and elevated temperatures, remineralization in upper sediments regenerates P efficiently enough to support a significant amount of P release to the water column even under sedimentary molar Fe/P ratios >20. We also discuss the implication of our findings for lake restoration strategies.

The same experimental methodology was tested during the decline of a diatom spring bloom in a eutrophic, temperate lake. A significant increase in bacterial biomass was observed due to the grazing activity of in situ mesozooplankters during the clear-water phase.

Hydrologic impacts of past shifts of Earth's thermal equator offer insight into those to be produced by fossil fuel CO2	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Major changes in global rainfall patterns accompanied a northward shift of Earth's thermal equator at the onset of an abrupt climate change 14.6 kya. This northward pull of Earth's wind and rain belts stemmed from disintegration of North Atlantic winter sea ice cover, which steepened the interhemispheric meridional temperature gradient. A southward migration of Earth's thermal equator may have accompanied the more recent Medieval Warm to Little Ice Age climate transition in the Northern Hemisphere. As fossil fuel CO2 warms the planet, the continents of the Northern Hemisphere are expected to warm faster than the Southern Hemisphere oceans. Therefore, we predict that a northward shift of Earth's thermal equator, initiated by an increased interhemispheric temperature contrast, may well produce hydrologic changes similar to those that occurred during past Northern Hemisphere warm periods. If so, the American West, the Middle East, and southern Amazonia will become drier, and monsoonal Asia, Venezuela, and equatorial Africa will become wetter. Additional paleoclimate data should be acquired and model simulations should be conducted to evaluate the reliability of this analog.

J	Caldwell, CA; Canavan, CM; Bloom, NS				Caldwell, CA; Canavan, CM; Bloom, NS			Potential effects of forest fire and storm flow on total mercury and methylmercury in sediments of an arid-lands reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A study was conducted from July 1995 to June 1996 to examine the spatial and temporal changes of mercury concentrations in sediments of an arid-lands reservoir. Prior to the first sample collection in July, a forest fire burned 2930 ha of mixed conifer and ponderosa pine in the watershed of Caballo Reservoir in south-central New Mexico. The fire was eventually extinguished by summer rains and storm runoff resulting in the mobilization and transport of charred vegetative material into an intermittent tributary (Palomas Creek) that drains the watershed into Caballo Reservoir. Concentrations of total mercury (THg), monomethlymercury (MMHg), and total organic carbon (TOC) in surficial sediments revealed fire, followed by storm runoff, enhanced the transport of mercury and organic matter to the reservoir. Concentrations of THg in sediments increased from 7.5 eta g/g in July to 46.1 eta g/g by November 1995 at one site (Palomas) nearest the outflow of Palomas Creek. No other spatial or temporal trends were observed for THg at other sites throughout the remainder of the study. Concentrations of MMHg in sediments at the Palomas site increased from 0.428 eta g/g in July to 12.46 eta g/g by October 1995 compared to concentrations in sediments at the remaining sites which ranged from 0.11 to 1.50 eta g/g throughout the study. The ratio of MMHg to THg (a gross index of methylation activity) was greatest in sediments from the Palomas site (5.4-33.8%) compared to the remaining sites (0.01-3.60%). The ratio was mirrored by elevated TOC in sediments at the Palomas site (2.5-11.8%) that remained elevated throughout the study. Fire and subsequent late-summer rains may have had a twofold effect on mercury concentrations in Caballo Reservoir.

The objectives were to examine the light conditions, to map optically active substances (OAS), and to develop remote sensing methods. Altogether 14 Estonian and 7 Finnish lakes representing different types of water, from oligotrophic to hypertrophic and dystrophic were included. We performed extensive analyses of concentrations of three main OAS, light attenuation and Secchi depth. They varied among lakes and with seasons, but no systematic temporal change could be detected during the 10-year period. We studied the underwater light field using a spectrometer and two PAR quantum sensors, and elaborated three versions of optical classification of lake waters based on: (1) apparent optical properties and the amount of OAS, (2) irradiance reflectance spectra, and (3) light attenuation coefficient and the predominant OAS. We developed two models for determining the diffuse attenuation spectra of light, using data for (1) one wavelength and (2) three wavelengths, and elaborated a semiempirical model for quantitative description of the underwater light regime. We developed a bio-optical model for interpretation of remote sensing data that allows simulation of the reflectance spectra based on the concentrations of OAS. Winter expeditions were undertaken to examine the optical properties of ice and snow and the light conditions in the water beneath the ice cover. Gas pockets are the main optically active impurity in snow and ice. The transparency of ice is similar to that of lake water. The ice cover lowers the light level and makes the light more diffuse in the near surface liquid water layer.					; Kutser, Tiit/H-1304-2015; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Kutser, Tiit/0000-0001-9679-1422; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564													1239-6095	1797-2469				APR 28	2008	13	2					133	158																WOS:000255872300006

Seasonal variability of circulation and air-sea interaction in the Caspian Sea based on a high resolution circulation model	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Caspian Sea is the largest closed basin on Earth, with unique physical characteristics and complex bathymetry. Sparse measurements and coarse resolution models have not yet provided a full picture of its dynamics. In this study, a high resolution (similar to 3.3 km) Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was used to study its annual and seasonal circulation patterns, and distributions of salinity and temperature. Temperature and salinity nudging were implemented which forced the model to follow in situ observations. This approach effectively limited the model error in predicting the temperature and salinity. The model successfully reproduced sea surface temperature and salinity over the entire basin. The simulated sea surface salinity showed three salinity fronts over the Caspian Sea. The salinity profile was vertically uniform in deep waters of the Caspian Sea. In contrast, the vertical thermal structure formed the seasonal thermocline at a depth of 15-40 m which was intensified in summer. In general, the seasonal variability of water temperature or salinity was confined to the upper 100 m of the water column. Simulations revealed an impermanent weak northward current along the eastern coasts of the Middle Caspian Sea, a persistent strong southward current along its western coasts and a permanent deep anticyclonic gyre over the Southern Caspian Sea. Using a high resolution model, this study also reports several mesoscale and small scale structures in the Caspian Sea which have not been reported before.

Satellite estimates and subpixel variability of rainfall in a semi-arid grassland	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS												Uncertainties in satellite rainfall estimation may derive from both the local rainfall characteristics and its subpixel variability. To study this issue, Micro Rain Radars and a rain gauge network were deployed within a 9-km satellite pixel in the semi-arid Xilingol grassland of China in summer 2009. The authors characterized the subpixel variability with the coefficient of variation (CV) and evaluated the satellite rainfall estimation for this semi-arid area. The results showed that rainfall events with a high CV were mostly convective with a small amount of rainfall. Spatially inhomogeneous rainfall was most likely to occur at the edges of small clouds producing rain. The performance of the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) 3B42V7 product for daily rainfall was better than that of the CMORPH (Climate Prediction Center morphing technique) and PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks) products, although the TRMM product tended to overestimate rainfall in a lake area of the semi-arid grassland.

J	Mehnert, G; Rücker, J; Wiedner, C				Mehnert, Grit; Ruecker, Jacqueline; Wiedner, Claudia			Population dynamics and akinete formation of an invasive and a native cyanobacterium in temperate lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Most cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales in the temperate zone survive winters in the sediment as akinetes. The present study compared seasonal population dynamics and the formation of akinetes of the invasive cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii with the native species Aphanizomenon gracile in three German lakes. The effect of light, temperature and growth rate on akinete formation was investigated in the field over a 3-year period and additionally in a culture study with nine different C. raciborskii and A. gracile strains. The results of the field study showed, for both species, a strong negative correlation between akinete formation and light and temperature, and a weaker negative correlation between akinete formation and the net growth rate of the populations. Akinete formation of the isolates was mainly affected by temperature and not by light intensity. The investigation of the seasonal population dynamics showed that the growth period of C. raciborskii in the pelagic zone was on average 64 days shorter compared with A. gracile. However, the amount of akinetes produced by C. raciborskii during 1 year was, in more than half of the cases, similar or higher than that produced by native A. gracile. The ratio of akinetes to total cell number was significantly higher for C. raciborskii compared with A. gracile, 9 and 2%, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that C. raciborskii populations in temperate lakes have a similar potential for an akinete-based life cycle performance as do the native A. gracile populations.

Comparing nearshore benthic and pelagic prey as mercury sources to lake fish: the importance of prey quality and mercury content	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in fish poses well-known health risks to wildlife and humans through fish consumption. Yet fish Hg concentrations are highly variable, and key factors driving this variability remain unclear. One little studied source of variation is the influence of habitat-specific feeding on Hg accumulation in lake fish. However, this is likely important because most lake fish feed in multiple habitats during their lives, and the Hg and caloric content of prey from different habitats can differ. This study used a three-pronged approach to investigate the extent to which habitat-specific prey determine differences in Hg bioaccumulation in fish. This study first compared Hg concentrations in common nearshore benthic invertebrates and pelagic zooplankton across five lakes and over the summer season in one lake, and found that pelagic zooplankton generally had higher Hg concentrations than most benthic taxa across lakes, and over a season in one lake. Second, using a bioenergetics model, the effects of prey caloric content from habitat-specific diets on fish growth and Hg accumulation were calculated. This model predicted that the consumption of benthic prey results in lower fish Hg concentrations due to higher prey caloric content and growth dilution (high weight gain relative to Hg from food), in addition to lower prey Hg levels. Third, using data from the literature, links between fish Hg content and the degree of benthivory, were examined, and showed that benthivory was associated with reduced Hg concentrations in lake fish. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that higher Hg content and lower caloric content make pelagic zooplankton prey greater sources of Hg for fish than nearshore benthic prey in lakes. Hence, habitat-specific foraging is likely to be a strong driver of variation in Hg levels within and between fish species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several methods of statistical analysis were used, including two-way hierarchical ANOVA, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis. No of the used methods could demonstrate that ecological and local races were present in the studied set of populations. Even in the cases, when the statistically significant differences among the populations in the morphology of shells were revealed, the interpopulation differences were very small and did not correspond to the "race" notion used by malacologists in the past. Perhaps, the formation of intraspecific races in Lymnaeidae is possible only in populations dwelling in suboptimal conditions, such as thermal springs and great depths of large mountain lakes.

J	Zárate-del Valle, PF; Simoneit, BRT				Zárate-del Valle, PF; Simoneit, BRT			The generation of hydrothermal oil in sediments of the Chapala Lake and its relation with the geothermal activity in the Citala rift, Jalisco State, Mexico	REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS GEOLOGICAS												Lake Chapala, located in the Citala Rift in western Mexico, is characterized by its active and fossil geothermal activity, which includes terresterial and sublacustrine hot springs, alterations halos, carbonated sinster deposits and mud volcanoes. Sub-lacustrine hot springs and asphalt emanations that constitute islets coexist in the lake. Oil generated in geothermic zones has an hydrothermal origin because circulating hot water generates both thermic alteration of organic matter and mass transference. For this reason, this oil is named hydrothermal petroleum (HP). Analyses by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the HP from Lake Chapala show that it consists of mature biomarkers and an unresolved complex mixture of branched and cyclic hydrocarbons (UCM). The mature biomarker, derivated from lacustrine microbiaota, consist mainly of 17 alpha(H),21 beta(-H)-hopanes from C-27 to C-34 (no C-28); gammacerane, tricyclic terpanes (C-20-C-26, no C-22); carotane and its cracking products; C-28 and C-29 steranes and drimanes (C-14-C-16). The hydrothermal petroleum of the Chapala Lake does not contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) no n-alkanes. The composition of this HP does not fit with conventional biodegraded petroleum residues. The absence of n-alkanes and isoprenoids and presence of UCM, mature hopanes, steranes and carotenoid biomarkers are consistent with rapid hypdrothermal oil generation, similar to hydrothermal petroleum from the East African Rift. We propose that the HP from Lake Chapala was generated rapidly from lacustrine organic matter at temperatures below that required fro hydrothermal cracking of alkanes from kerogen (250 degrees C). The hydrothermal petroleum of Lake Chapala was forced by tectonic activity to the lake bed from a depth estimated in 300-500 m. where the sediments have C-14 ages > 40 ka. The bulk carbon of the HP of Lake Chapala has a mean delta C-13(PDB) of -21.4% which is a typical value for lacustrine organic matter. The occurrence of hydrothermal petroleum in continental rift systems is now well understood and should be included as a target in exploration for future energy resources in such regions.

J	Qiu, XH; Zhu, T				Qiu, Xinghua; Zhu, Tong			Using the o,p′-DDT/p,p′-DDT ratio to identify DDT sources in China	CHEMOSPHERE												Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been banned in China for decades, and yet high DDT concentrations are still being detected in the Chinese environment. This might be at least partly due to the current use of dicofol formulation, which contains DDT as an impurity. In this study, a method based on the ratios of two DDT isomers, o,p '-DDT and p,p '-DDT, was established and used to estimate the relative contributions of dicofol formulation and those of technical DDT to overall environmental DDT. Based on this method and field data from the literature, we calculated that dicofol formulation contributed >72% of atmospheric DDT in 2004 in the Taihu Lake region, China, and this value was >84% in summer when dicofol was applied for agricultural purposes. Sediment and soil, however, contained mostly residual DDT from the historical use of technical DDT. In most other regions of China, we found that dicofol contributed to a significant fraction of DDT in air samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Field Study to Investigate Repeat Homing in Pacific Lampreys	BIOLOGY, MANAGEMENT, AND CONSERVATION OF LAMPREYS IN NORTH AMERICA	American Fisheries Society Symposium				American-Fisheries-Society Symposium 72 on Biology and Conservation of Lampreys in North America	SEP 06, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Amer Fisheries Soc				In-season homing of Pacific lampreys Lampetra tridentata was investigated using radiotelemetry in the lower Columbia River from 1998 through 1999. A total of 50 Pacific lampreys were captured: 25 at Willamette Falls (river kilometer [rkm] 45 on the Willamette River, a tributary to the Columbia River, with its confluence at rkm 163) and 25 at Bonneville Dam (rkm 238 on the Columbia River). Each fish was fitted with a radio transmitter, transported, and released in the Columbia River approximately 26 km downstream from the confluence of the Willamette River. Movement of the radio-tagged Pacific lampreys was monitored for several months using mobile and fixed receiver stations to observe rates of homing towards the site of original capture. Results indicated that the lampreys exhibited nonsignificant in-season homing fidelity (p = 0.622) based on the null expectation that one-half of the total recoveries would home and the other half would stray. Final location classifications were 17 homed, 20 strayed, and 13 undetermined. The undetermined classification included individuals that were not detected upstream of the confluence of the Willamette River or in other Columbia River tributaries. Final location classifications were not influenced by fish length (p = 0.594). Although considered weak swimmers, Pacific lampreys were capable of traveling at velocities near 2.5 km/h and sustaining that activity for at least 24 h.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-13-4				2009	72						191	201																WOS:000277990500011

However, the long-term lake evolution and underlying mechanisms, especially on the exorheic southern TP, remain unclear. Here, we reconstructed the lake level variations of Mabu Co and Gala Co on the southern TP through detailed paleo-shoreline dating using post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) signals of K-feldspar single grains, and explored the driving forcings based on a comparison of paleoclimate records and geomorphological analysis. The results show that a unified paleolake at Mabu Co and Gala Co at a level -20 m above the modern level (a.m.l.) of Mabu Co developed during the late MIS 3 (35.9 +/- 1.9-29.1 +/- 1.4 ka) in response to increased glacial meltwater and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall. Under intensive glacier melting, the paleolake reached its maximum level (-29 m a.m.l.) and area (190 km2, -22 times larger than the modern areas of Mabu Co and Gala Co) during the last deglacial (16.8 +/- 1.0-13.6 +/- 0.7 ka) and began to outflow, which triggered incision and lowering of the spill-point. The lake level showed an overall decreasing trend since the last deglacial largely influenced by the lowering of the spill-point. During the last deglacial-early Holocene (12.7 +/- 0.6-9.8 +/- 0.6 ka), a high-stand lower than that in the previous stage (-24 m a. m.l.) was maintained by the strengthened ISM and glacial meltwater. In the mid-Holocene (8.7 +/- 0.9-4.1 +/- 0.3 ka), the paleolake experienced two rapid lake level drops in response to the weakening events of the ISM. The exposed shoreline terrace between the two lakes following the lake level drop after -6 ka provided an ideal living surface for the inhabitants at the Mabu Co site during 4.5-4.0 ka. We found that glacial meltwater and lake spillover processes, apart from the ISM, have exerted great impacts on the hydrological history of Mabu Co and Gala Co. The paleolakes have provided critical resources for humans at the Mabu Co site living in the alpine anoxic environment. Additionally, we suggest that lakes with low spill-points adjacent to exorheic basins on the southern TP should be given more attention regarding flooding hazard risks against increasing precipitation and glacial meltwater in the future.

S	Yazicigil, H; Ekmekci, M		Harmancioglu, NB; Altinbilek, D		Yazicigil, Hasan; Ekmekci, Mehmet			Groundwater	WATER RESOURCES OF TURKEY	World Water Resources											About 18% of the total water resources potential of Turkey is made up of groundwater resources. Significant portion of the streamflow of major rivers is supplied by groundwater through springs and baseflow. In 1960s and early 1970s, the financial capacity of Turkey did not allow construction of large dams for irrigation. Development of groundwater resources in alluvial plain aquifers where the agriculture was concentrated has been a priority. In 1990s, the building of large dams has been boosted and irrigation by surface waters preferred due to the lower operational cost. From 1990s, not enough funds have been allocated to explore and develop groundwater resources. In spite of its strategic significance, much more has been invested to investigate and develop the "visible" resource. This unbalanced policy of water resources management has reflected also in the organizational and institutional structure of Turkey. Groundwater resources of Turkey mainly occur in alluvial and karstic aquifers. Large coastal plains and deltas, grabens and pull-apart basins constitute the major alluvial aquifers. The thick and extensive carbonate rocks along the Taurus mountain belt favor formation of productive karst aquifers. The fractured rock aquifers are either low yield or of local importance. Igneous rocks have no permeability and they have very limited outcrops. Groundwater occurs in younger volcanic rocks with limited extension. However, volcanic rock aquifers at foothills of volcanoes, such as Erciyes and Nemrut, may supply a great amount of groundwater where they are recharged by snowmelt. Metamorphic rocks are hydrogeological barriers, in general. They may bear very little amounts of groundwater that might support aquatic ecosystems. Turkey has faced some water mismanagement problems whose consequences are observable in terms of the decline of groundwater levels, reduced spring and streamflows, desiccation of lakes and wetlands and loss of ecosystems. These consequences resulting mainly from managing surface waters and groundwater resources separately, ignoring that they are interacting subsystems of the same and single source, are becoming more frequent and severe. Implementation of the EU-Water Framework Directive has helped, to a certain extent, to maintain the "good status" and to "recover" the degraded water resources and the ecosystems. The "safe yield" approach that has been used in groundwater management needs to be changed to a "sustainable yield" approach which considers also the ecological water needs. This can only be achieved by competent persons who are educated in hydrogeological characterization, conceptualization and modelling of groundwater systems.

In recent years, there have been many studies on monitoring water level and volume changes in inland waters, but they were mainly focused on radar altimetry and the full waveform LiDAR ICESat, which was retired in 2010. Few studies based on the latest photon-counting LiDAR ICESat-2 have been reported. Compared with previous sensors, ICESat-2 has great advantages in footprint size, transmitting frequency, pulse number, etc, but its performance in monitoring water level and volume changes in inland waters has not been fully explored. Here we investigated the spatial distribution of water level and volume changes of 11 lakes and 8 reservoirs in the Yellow River Basin based on ICESat-2 and Google Earth Engine, and analyzed the factors affecting the measurement uncertainties. In-situ validation of lake level in Lake Qinghai indicates that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of our result is only 7 cm after the reference coordinate system conversion. We found that the water level trend of the natural lake shows significant seasonal variations, while the water level trend of the reservoir shows a sharp rise and fall. In addition, precipitation plays a decisive role in the changes in natural lake levels and indirectly affects the artificial control of reservoirs' water discharges. The uncertainty of water volume change monitoring is mainly affected by water level measurement uncertainty for lakes, while for reservoirs, that is affected by the combination of water level and area measurement uncertainties. The stability of lake level measurement increases with the increase in photon counts. The introduction of ICESat-2 ATL13 Significant Wave Height might lead larger standard deviation in water level measurement. According to the law of propagation of uncertainty, the uncertainty of the water volume change estimation by the combination of ICESat-2 and GEE is less than 9 %.

Strain variations across the Proterozoic Penokean Orogen, USA and Canada	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Strata in the Huron (2.5-2.0 Ga) and Animikie (2.2-1.85 Ga) basins were deposited on the southern margin of the Archean Superior province. These rocks were deformed during the Penokean orogeny (similar to 1850 Ma) followed by subsequent accretionary orogens to the south at 1750 Ma (Yavapai) and 1630 Ma (Mazatzal). Strain patterns are unique to each orogenic belt with no far-field effect: Archean Wawa terrane rocks in the Penokean foreland preserve deformation associated with Archean accretion with no younger Penokean, Yavapai or Mazatzal strain overprint. The Penokean orogeny deformed Huron-Animikie basin sediments into a north- vergent fold-and-thrust belt with no Yavapai or Mazatzal strain overprint. Yavapai orogen strains (SW-NE margin-parallel shortening) are unique when compared to the younger Mazatzal shortening (N20 degrees W) shortening, with no strain overprint. Penokean deformation is characterized by shortening from the south including uplifted Archean gneisses and a northerly thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt, with north-vergent nappes and a gently-dipping foreland. Our study of finite and calcite twinning strains (n = 60) along (similar to 1500 km) and across (similar to 200 km) the Penokean belt indicate that this orogeny was collisional as layer-parallel shortening axes are parallel across the belt, or parallel to the tectonic transport direction (similar to N-S). Penokean nappe burial near the margin resulted in vertical shortening strain overprints, some of which are layer-normal. The Sudbury impact layer (1850 Ma) is found across the Animikie basin and provides a widespread deformation marker with many local, unique strain observations. We also report new geochronology (U-Pb zircon and apatite) for the gneiss-mafic dike rocks at Wissota (Chippewa Falls, WI) and Arbutus (Black River Falls, WI) dams, respectively, which bears on Penokean-Yavapai deformation in the Archean Marshfield terrane which was accreted during the Penokean orogen. Pseudotachylite formation was common in the Superior province Archean basement rocks, especially along terrane boundaries reactivated by contemporaneous Penokean, Trans-Hudson, Cape Smith and New Quebec deformation. In the hinterland (south), the younger Yavapai orogen (1750 Ma; n = 8) deformation is preserved as margin-parallel horizontal shortening (similar to SW-NE) in Yavapai crust and up to 200 km to the north in the Penokean thrust belt as a strain and Barrovian metamorphic overprint. Mazatzal deformation (1630 Ma; n = 16) is preserved in quartzites on Yavapai and Penokean crust with layer-parallel and layer-normal shortening strains oriented N20 degrees W.					; Schmitz, Mark/A-2540-2012	Gifford, Jennifer/0000-0003-2857-9635; Schmitz, Mark David/0000-0003-2888-0321; 													0301-9268	1872-7433				NOV	2018	318						25	69		10.1016/j.precamres.2018.09.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2018.09.004													WOS:000450381900002

Point sources and agricultural practices control spatial-temporal patterns of orthophosphate in tributaries to Chesapeake Bay	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Orthophosphate (PO4) is the most bioavailable form of phosphorus (P). Excess PO4 may cause harmful algal blooms in aquatic ecosystems. A major restoration effort is underway for Chesapeake Bay (CB) to reduce P, nitrogen, and sediment loading to CB. Although PO4 cycling and delivery to streams has been characterized in small-scale studies, regional drivers of PO4 patterns remain poorly understood because most water quality trend assessment focus on total P. Moreover, these trend assessments are usually at an annual timestep. To address this research gap, we analyzed PO4 patterns over a 9-year period at 53 monitoring stations across the CB watershed to: 1) characterize the role of PO4 in total P fluxes and trends; 2) describe spatial and temporal patterns of PO4 concentrations across seasons and streamflow; and 3) explore factors explaining these patterns. Agriculturalb watersheds exported the most total P compared with watersheds under different land uses (e.g., urban or forest), with PO4 comprising up to 50% of those exports. Although PO4 exports are declining at many sites, some agricultural regions are experiencing increasing trends at a rate sufficient to drive total P trends. Regression modeling results suggest that point source load reductions are likely responsible for decreasing PO4 concentrations observed at many sites. Watersheds with more Conservation Reserve Program enrollment had lower summer PO4 concentrations, highlighting the effectiveness of this practice. Manure inputs strongly predicted PO4 concentrations at high flows across all seasons. Both manure applications and conservation tillage were correlated with changes in PO4 concentrations at high flow, suggesting these activities could contribute to increasing PO4 concentrations. This study highlights the effectiveness of point source control for reducing PO4 exports and underscores the need for management strategies to target sources, practices, and landscape factors determining PO4 loss from soils where manure inputs remain high.

J	Sheldon, ND				Sheldon, Nathan D.			Causes and consequences of low atmospheric pCO2 in the Late Mesoproterozoic	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Based upon various proxy, theoretical, and model constraints, Paleoproterozoic atmospheric pCO(2) was much higher than Phanerozoic levels. However, relatively little is known about the transition between the two climate states. Here, geochemicalmass-balance from similar to 1.1 Ga old Midcontinent Rift System(USA) paleosols is used to reconstruct atmospheric pCO(2) during the Mesoproterozoic. The calculations robustly indicate low atmospheric pCO(2) (<10 times Preindustrial levels). Results are consistent between seven paleosols at one site, between paleosols at different Midcontinental Rift sites, and between the new results and previously published penecontemporaneous paleosol and microfossil reconstructions. The newly recognized Mesoproterozoic pCO(2) minimum is best explained as the culmination of a long-term C burial event by the biosphere that is also indicated by marine carbonate delta C-13 changes during the Mesoproterozoic, and which is consistent with changes in the biosphere including increased stromatolite abundance and diversity, evolution of sulfur-utilizing bacteria, and the spread of microbial mats into continental environments.

Environmental contaminants in Canadian shorebirds	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Canadian shorebirds are exposed to environmental contaminants throughout their annual cycle. Contaminant exposure among species varies with diet, foraging behaviour and migration patterns. We sampled twelve species of shorebirds from four locations across Canada to assess their exposure to PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, as well as four trace elements (Hg, Se, Cd, As). Sigma PCB and Sigma DDT followed by Sigma CHL were most frequently found above trace level in the shorebird carcasses. In general, the plover species (American golden, semipalmated, black-bellied) appear to be the most contaminated with organochlorines, whereas Hudsonian and marbled godwits appear to be the least contaminated. Among adult birds, the greater and lesser yellowlegs had the highest hepatic Hg concentrations (2.4-2.7 mu g g(-1) dw), whereas American golden plovers as well as Hudsonian and marbled godwits contained relatively low levels of Hg (< 1 mu g g(-1) dw). Renal Se concentrations varied from 3.2 to 16.7 mu g g(-1) dw and exhibited little interspecific or seasonal variation. Renal Cd levels in adult birds were highest in Hudsonian godwits from Quill Lakes (43 mu g g(-1) dw) and Cape Churchill (12 mu g g(-1) dw), and lowest (0.8-1.5 mu g g(-1) dw) in greater and lesser yellowlegs from Cape Churchill and Bay of Fundy. Renal As concentrations varied from 0.06 mu g g(-1) dw in golden plovers from Cape Churchill to 4.6 and 5.1 mu g g(-1) dw in dunlin samples from the Pacific coast. There is no evidence that contaminants were adversely affecting the shorebirds sampled from the Canadian locations in this study.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2009	148	1-4					185	204		10.1007/s10661-007-0150-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-0150-0								18340543					WOS:000261581800018

Past and present fish species recorded in the estuarine Lake Ichkeul, northern Tunisia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Lake Ichkeul in northern Tunisia is a Ramsar site, a MAB Biosphere Reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The system is one of the most important coastal wetlands in North Africa, especially as an over-wintering area for migratory birds, particularly Palaearctic waterfowl. The present study was aimed at diagnosing the status of fish species in Lake Ichkeul and documenting their annual and seasonal occurrence within the system. Fish samples were collected monthly at 22 sites from March 2011 to April 2012 using a variety of gears, including a dragnet, gillnet, trammelnet, frynet and beach-seine. Temperature and salinity measurements were taken at each site, while fishes were obtained from only 11 sites, representing mainly lacustrine stations. A total of 18 fish species belonging to 14 genera and 12 families were identified, with Mugilidae dominating with four species, followed by Syngnathidae with three species. This study represents a relative recovery in terms of fish species richness, since only 13 species were recorded here between 2003 and 2007. However, the numbers of fish caught, especially of the commercial taxa, seem to have declined in recent years, and the number of species currently present is much lower than that of several decades ago. Increasing human pressures, particularly reductions in catchment freshwater inputs, a breakdown in ecosystem connectivity, pollution and over-fishing appear to be the principal causes for the decline in fish abundance and diversity.					; Fassatoui, Chiheb/R-9725-2018; Romdhane, Mohamed Salah/GTB-5864-2022	FASSATOUI, Chiheb/0000-0003-2624-4081; 													1608-5914	1727-9364					2016	41	2					171	180		10.2989/16085914.2016.1153453	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2016.1153453													WOS:000377794600005
J	Botte, V; Kay, A				Botte, V; Kay, A			A model of the wind-driven circulation in Lake Baikal	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												A numerical model based on the Navier-Stokes equations is used to simulate the circulation produced by a strong wind in a cross-section of Lake Baikal. Temperature distributions have been obtained for different stages of the spring warming of the lake, using available measurements and simulating the faster warming of the near-shore areas in accordance with the local stability conditions. These have been used as initial conditions for the prediction of the wind-driven circulation. The results presented suggest that buoyancy forces have little impact on the magnitude of vertical currents descending towards the bottom of the lake, but the action of buoyancy forces could initiate additional motions that have been found to generate strong vertical currents far from the shores. Furthermore, there appears to be evidence in our data of local acceleration linked to changes in the bottom topography of the section. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Zhang, T; Hsu-Kim, H				Zhang, Tong; Hsu-Kim, Heileen			Photolytic degradation of methylmercury enhanced by binding to natural organic ligands	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that accumulates in food webs and poses a significant risk to human health(1). In natural water bodies, methylmercury concentrations remain low due to the degradation of methylmercury into inorganic mercury by sunlight, a process known as photodecomposition. Rates of photodecomposition are relatively rapid in freshwater lakes(2-4), and slow in marine waters(5), but the cause of this difference is not clear. Here, we carry out incubation experiments with artificial freshwater and seawater samples to examine the mechanisms regulating methylmercury photodecomposition. We show that singlet oxygen-a highly reactive form of dissolved oxygen generated by sunlight falling on dissolved organic matter-drives photodecomposition. However, in our experiments the rate of methylmercury degradation depends on the type of methylmercury-binding ligand present in the water. Relatively fast degradation rates (similar to observations in freshwater lakes) were detected when methylmercury species were bound to sulphur-containing ligands such as glutathione and mercaptoacetate. In contrast, methylmercury-chloride complexes, which are the dominant form of methylmercury in marine systems, did not degrade as easily. Our results could help to explain why methylmercury photodecomposition rates are relatively rapid in freshwater lakes and slow in marine waters.					; Hsu-Kim, Heileen/A-5409-2008	Zhang, Tong/0000-0002-8151-3697; Hsu-Kim, Heileen/0000-0003-0675-4308													1752-0894	1752-0908				JUL	2010	3	7					473	476		10.1038/NGEO892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO892								20634995					WOS:000279375500013
J	Elliott, JM				Elliott, J. M.			Density-dependent and density-independent growth in a population of juvenile sea-trout, Salmo trutta, assessed using long-term data from a small stream in Northwest England	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The objectives were to check the validity of a growth model and to examine the relationship between population density and (i) the overall mean length of the trout (ii) the difference between each model-estimated mean length and the observed mean lengths for the highest and lowest 10% of measurements in each sample and (iii) the individual variation in trout lengths (measured by coefficient of variation: CV%). First (0+)- and second (1+)-year-old juvenile sea-trout were sampled by electrofishing at the beginning and at the end of the summer from 1967 to 2000. The trout left the stream as pre-smolts in May, soon after their second birthday, so that few 2+ trout were taken. Length, rather than mass, was used in this study because all fish were measured, but only a subsample was weighed. Mean length was not related to population density and, therefore, mean growth was density independent. A growth model (Elliott, Hurley & Fryer, 1995) estimated the mean mass of the trout over the two years spent in fresh water. These estimates were converted to mean length, using length-mass regression equations. There was good agreement in most year-classes between the model-estimated value and the observed mean length for all trout taken in each sample. Exceptions were that the mean length of 0+ trout after two summer droughts was lower than expected, although compensatory growth followed, so that observed and expected values were similar for 1+ trout. Mean lengths for the highest and lowest 10% of measurements in each sample were significantly higher or lower, respectively, than the estimated mean value. The difference between the latter and the higher or lower mean values was related negatively to population density. Therefore, mean lengths of the fastest and slowest growing trout were density dependent. There was also a negative relationship between population density and the CV% for 0+ and 1+ trout. Therefore, although growth in terms of overall mean length was density independent, individual variation in trout growth was density dependent, being highest at low density and lowest at high density of trout.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2015	60	2					336	346		10.1111/fwb.12493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12493													WOS:000347706400009

On the basis of the limited knowledge that is currently available, the present inferences can be made as follows: (1) Warming can cause enhanced leaching of ionic solutes from the catchments to surface waters, including cations and more biologically labile anions such as sulphate. Preferential sulphate biodegradation followed by removal as organic sulphides in sediment could increase alkalinity, favouring the generation of the carbonate radical, CO3 (center dot-). However, this phenomenon would be easily offset by fluctuations of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is strongly anticorrelated with CO3 (center dot-). Therefore, obtaining insight into DOC evolution is a key issue in understanding the link between photochemistry and climate. (2) Climate change could exacerbate water scarcity in the dry season in some regions. Fluctuations in the water column could deeply alter photochemistry that is usually favoured in shallower waters. However, the way water is lost would strongly affect the prevailing photoinduced processes. Water outflow without important changes in solute concentration would mostly favour reactions induced by the hydroxyl and carbonate radicals (center dot OH and CO3 (center dot-)). In contrast, evaporative concentration would enhance reactions mediated by singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and by the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ((CDOM)-C-3*). (3) In a warmer climate, the summer stratification period of lakes would last longer, thereby enhancing photochemical reactions in the epilimnion but at the same time keeping the hypolimnion water in the dark for longer periods.

Grey to black and variegated lacustrine mudstones, laminites and carbonates of the Rudnik member have a lateral extent of more than 400 km(2). In the studied sections four facies associations were recognised: A) anoxic offshore, B) suboxic to oxic offshore, C) nearshore and mudflat, and D) slope deposits. In the northern part of the E-W elongated basin, anoxic to suboxic organic-rich offshore lacustrine facies dominate and form a succession up to 130 m thick. Fan-delta and turbidite facies occur locally along the faulted northern basin margin. The central part of the basin is occupied by anoxic to oxic offshore facies interfingering with nearshore carbonate and mudflat facies of the low-gradient lacustrine margin. In the central part of the basin, the thickness of the lacustrine deposits of the Rudnik member reaches up to 60-70 m. In the southern part of the basin fluvial and alluvial plain facies dominate and alternate with minor lacustrine nearshore facies. The lateral facies distribution indicates that subsidence along the northern basin fault was the main mechanism generating the asymmetric infill geometry in the basin's half-graben setting. The delta O-18 values of primary and early diagenetic calcite range between -11.0 parts per thousand and +1.3 parts per thousand (V-PDB) and delta C-13 values between -5.1 parts per thousand and +3.7 parts per thousand; most of the data fall within the range of freshwater limestones. Coarser-grained pure microspar laminae show more positive delta C-13 values in comparison to clayey organic-rich micrite laminae, and are interpreted,as a record of bioinduced precipitation during seasonal eutrophication. The obtained delta C-13(TOC) values range from -29.0 parts per thousand to -24.0 parts per thousand, the total organic carbon (TOC) content from 0.26% to 23%. Maceral analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis indicate that most of the samples contain a mixture of aquatic and terrestrial organic matter, but two minor, distinctive groups of samples with algally-dominated and terrestrially-dominated organic matter composition, respectively, were also found. The study of vertical changes in boron content in the clay fraction of the lacustrine mudstones shows that high lake level stages were periods of lower salinity with the lowest boron contents (from 73 to 268 ppm), and periods of falling lake level were followed by significant increases in salinity with much higher boron values (293-603 ppm). Lake-level fluctuations of the Rudnik lacustrine system, which are recorded by shallowing-up units of sedimentary facies within most of the sections throughout the basin, can also be traced within the monotonous black shale dominated sections, where no sedimentological evidence of these lake level changes exists. Good indicators for such changes seem to be the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of primary calcite, delta C-13(TOC) and HI. These lake level fluctuations are interpreted as driven by climatic oscillations in the order of tens of thousands years, which could reflect climatic changes connected with the last glaciation event of Gondwana.

Responses to Lake Michigan water level rise: Trends in exposed sand cover at North Avenue Beach, Chicago	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												From 2013 to 2020, water levels in Lake Michigan rose from an all-time low to the highest levels observed in nearly four decades, causing shoreline changes throughout the Great Lakes. These changes are particularly noticeable at North Avenue Beach in Chicago, an artificial beach where federal, state, and city agencies have mitigated rising waters by importing sand and constructing groins. Using spring season aerial imagery from 2012 to 2020, we calculated beach area for each year and compared sand cover loss between years to water level change per the USGS station located just south of the study area. Analysis reveals year-to-year loss in sand cover since 2013, with the largest single-year change occurring between 2018 and 2019. An inverse relationship with a slight lag exists between water level and these beach area changes. We calculated sand-groin distances from 2000 to 2020 to identify north-south effects. Of the six beach cells separated by groins, the northernmost two cells failed over the study period, and experienced the largest individual sand-groin distance losses. We modeled inundation to investigate whether the sand loss was explainable by lake level change alone, with particular attention given to hardened shoreline implemented north of the beach in 2015. Observed sand cover loss markedly exceeded predictions from the inundation modeling. In addition to water level changes, a local response to shoreline modification and obstruction of sediment transport at this site may influence sand cover.

J	Natchimuthu, S; Selvam, BP; Bastviken, D				Natchimuthu, Sivakiruthika; Selvam, Balathandayuthabani Panneer; Bastviken, David			Influence of weather variables on methane and carbon dioxide flux from a shallow pond	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Freshwaters are important sources of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Knowledge about temporal variability in these fluxes is very limited, yet critical for proper study design and evaluating flux data. Further, to understand the reasons for the variability and allow predictive modeling, the temporal variability has to be related to relevant environmental variables. Here we analyzed the effect of weather variables on CH4 and CO2 flux from a small shallow pond during a period of 4 months. Mean CH4 flux and surface water CH4 concentration were 8.0 [3.3-15.1] +/- A 3.1 mmol m(-2) day(-1) (mean [range] +/- A 1 SD) and 1.3 [0.3-3.5] +/- A 0.9 A mu M respectively. Mean CO2 flux was 1.1 [-9.8 to 16.0] +/- A 6.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1). Substantial diel changes in CO2 flux and surface water CH4 concentration were observed during detailed measurements over a 24 h cycle. Thus diel patterns need to be accounted for in future measurements. Significant positive correlations of CH4 emissions with temperature were found and could include both direct temperature effects as well as indirect effects (e.g. related to the growth season and macrophyte primary productivity providing organic substrates). CO2 flux on the other hand was negatively correlated to temperature and solar radiation, presumably because CO2 consumption by plants was higher relative to CO2 production by respiration during warm sunny days. Interestingly, CH4 fluxes were comparable to ponds with similar morphometry and macrophyte abundance in the tropics. We therefore hypothesize that CH4 and CO2 summer emissions from ponds could be more related to the morphometry and dominating primary producers rather than latitude per se. Data indicate that CH4 emissions, given the system characteristic frameworks, is positively affected by increased temperatures or prolonged growth seasons.					; Natchimuthu, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/0000-0002-9058-3048													0168-2563	1573-515X				JUN	2014	119	1-3					403	413		10.1007/s10533-014-9976-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-014-9976-z													WOS:000336028400026

Cultural ecosystem services and public preferences: How to integrate them effectively into Smart City planning?	2020 SMART CITY SYMPOSIUM PRAGUE (SCSP)					Smart Cities Symposium Prague (SCSP)	JUN 25, 2020	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	IEEE				Green and blue infrastructure is implemented increasingly often in cities. The objective of this paper is to investigate specific elements of green and blue infrastructure and types of facilities that are the most preferred among city residents. This paper shows the results of a questionnaire survey and a discrete choice experiment from Prague. Among the 14 elements of green and blue infrastructure examined, public parks were the most preferred element followed by urban forests, rivers/streams and lakes/lagoons. The results of the discrete choice experiment also show that Prague residents prefer presence of benches, bins and toilets in the green and blue infrastructure areas. Small-scale mental mapping was also used to show how these survey and choice experiment results can be used in specific parts of the city. The mental mapping also further confirmed that Prague residents mostly prefer public parks and forests in summer. Streets, metro station surroundings and squares are the least preferred areas.

The Desert Fireball Network: A Sensor Network for Meteorite Tracking and Recovery	2016 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, ROBOTICS AND VISION (ICARCV)	International Conference on Control Automation Robotics and Vision				14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)	NOV 13-15, 2016	Phukhet, THAILAND					The Desert Fireball Network is a sensor network on a continental scale, with the objective of recovering fresh meteorite falls and calculating associated heliocentric orbits. The network was first established in 2005 as a trial network of three (and later four) film camera observatories, which had immediate success with the successful recovery of meteorites in 2008 and 2010. The network was re-established in 2012 as a network of digital fireball observatories, and now comprises over 50 observatories with an observable area over 2.5 million square kilometres. The new digital network was validated at the very end of 2015, with the successful recovery of the Murrili meteorite from Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre in South Australia. This paper describes the design of the observatories and network, and outlines a semiautomated data pipeline which handles nearly a petabyte of data per year.

EON-ROSE and the Canadian Cordillera Array - Building Bridges to Span Earth System Science in Canada	GEOSCIENCE CANADA												EON-ROSE (Earth-System Observing Network - Reseau d'Observation du Systeme terrestrE) is a new initiative for a pan-Canadian research collaboration to holistically examine Earth systems from the ionosphere into the core. The Canadian Cordillera Array (CC Array) is the pilot phase, and will extend across the Cordillera from the Beaufort Sea to the U.S. border. The vision for EON-ROSE is to install a network of telemetered observatories to monitor solid Earth, environmental and atmospheric processes. EON-ROSE is an inclusive, combined effort of Canadian universities, federal, provincial and territorial government agencies, industry, and international collaborators. Brainstorming sessions and several workshops have been held since May 2016. The first station will be installed at Kluane Lake Research Station in southwestern Yukon during the summer of 2018. The purpose of this report is to provide a framework for continued discussion and development.

Michael			Methane dynamics of high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada California: the role of elevation, temperature, and inorganic nutrients	INLAND WATERS												Freshwater lakes are important but poorly constrained sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, reflecting high but variable rates of CH4 production as well as limited and inconsistent measurements worldwide. High-elevation lakes have been particularly overlooked given their high abundance in mountain ranges around the world, and the potential for CH4 dynamics at high elevations is expected to be disproportionally impacted by increases in temperature due to climate change. We examined variations in surface CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes, temperature, and inorganic nutrients in 5 montane lakes spanning multiple elevations in the Sierra Nevada of California. Over 2 years, we found strong and consistent seasonality in CH4 concentrations in lakes; higher concentrations were typically observed in the warmest months and lower concentrations right before winter. Changes in CH4 concentrations were significantly related to temperature in the majority of the individual lakes (r(2) = 0.43-0.81) and related to elevation (r(2) = 0.39) across lakes. Methane concentrations in lakes at elevations <3000 m were strongly related to temperature, nitrite concentrations, and elevation (r(2) = 0.90), whereas at elevations >3000 m, CH4 was related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen to dissolved inorganic phosphorus ratios and elevation (r(2) = 0.48). Our results expand our understanding of temporal variations in CH4 and demonstrate substantial seasonality in CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes in freshwater lakes. We suggest that temporal variation should be considered in large-scale estimates of CH4 emissions, and these fluxes may be a predictable function of elevation, temperature, and nutrients.

A 700-year history of groundwater recharge in the drylands of NW China	HOLOCENE												A 700-year semi-quantitative history of diffuse groundwater recharge in the Badain Jaran Desert (Inner Mongolia) is proposed on the basis of solute data from multiple unsaturated zone groundwater profiles using mass balance of chloride to establish recharge rates and profile chronologies. Four relatively humid (1330-1430, 1500-1620, 1700-1780 and 1950-1990) and three relatively arid phases (1430-1500, 1620-1700 and 1900-1950) are discernable across the profiles. The recharge history broadly reflects multidecadal to centurial timescale precipitation changes in the northern Tibetan Plateau and suggests that variations in East Asian Summer Monsoon intensity affect desert recharge rates. Uncertainties in the records owing to assumptions about the Cl inputs are examined by comparing deterministic and stochastic Cl input scenarios. Such records are valuable for assessing spatial aspects of climate changes in the region, as well as for informing sustainable water resource management strategies for northwestern China's drylands.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2008	18	7					1045	1054		10.1177/0959683608095575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608095575													WOS:000260339000003

The effect of capture, handling, and tagging on hematological variables in wild adult lake sturgeon	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We measured hematocrit and plasma osmolality, cortisol, lactate, glucose, and chloride in wild lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens after gill-net capture (24-h sets) and multiple bouts of brief (2-3-min) air exposure during removal from nets and again during measurement and tagging procedures. Our objective was to evaluate the physiological consequences associated with capture, handling, and tagging activities commonly employed during mark-recapture studies and to determine whether blood chemistry values moved toward a resting state after a 3-d recovery period. Lake sturgeon that were caught during spring tagging activities showed plasma cortisol, glucose, lactate, osmolality, and chloride levels similar to those exhibited by maximally stressed lake sturgeon in published laboratory studies. After the 3-d recovery period, all physiological stress indicators had approached a nonstressed state and the values were similar to those previously reported for resting lake sturgeon. It appears that capture-mark-recapture programs that subject lake sturgeon to stressors similar to those applied here do not pose a significant threat to this often legislatively protected species.

J	Yuan, JJ; Liu, DY; Xiang, J; He, TH; Kang, H; Ding, WX				Yuan, Junji; Liu, Deyan; Xiang, Jian; He, Tiehu; Kang, Hojeong; Ding, Weixin			Methane and nitrous oxide have separated production zones and distinct emission pathways in freshwater aquaculture ponds	WATER RESEARCH												Aquaculture systems receive intensive carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) loadings, and are therefore recognized as major anthropogenic sources of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the extensively managed aquaculture ponds were identified as a hotspot of CH4 emission but just a weak N2O source. Here, we investigate annual CH4 and N2O fluxes from three earthen ponds used for crab culture, of different sizes, in southeast China. Our purposes are to identify the spatiotemporal variations of CH4 and N2O emissions and their components among ponds and to evaluate the zone for CH4 and N2O production. Static chamber-measured CH4 flux ranged from 0.03 to 64.7 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (average: 9.02-14.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), and temperature, followed by dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration, and redox potential, were the primary drivers of seasonal CH4 flux patterns. Annual mean diffusive CH4 flux was 1.80-2.34 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and that by ebullition was up to 7.20-12.0 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (79.1-83.5% of the total CH4 flux). Annual CH4 emission was positively correlated with sediment DOC concentration but negatively (P < 0.05) correlated with water depth across ponds, with the highest CH4 emission occurred in a pond with low water depth and high DOC concentration. The calculated diffusive N2O flux by the gas transfer velocity was 0.32-0.60 times greater than the measured N2O emission, suggesting that N2O in water column can not only evade as water-air fluxes but diffuse downwards and to be consumed in anaerobic sediments. This also indicates that N2O was primarily produced in water column. The highly reduced condition and depletion of NO3--N in sediments, can limit N2O production from both nitrification and denitrification but favor N2O consumption, leading the ponds to become a weak source of N2O annually and even a sink of N2O in summer. Our results highlight that the current global CH4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and underestimation of the contribution of ebullitive CH4 flux in small lentic waters. The downwards N2O diffusion from the water column into sediment also indicates that the extensively-used model approach based on gas transfer velocity potentially overestimates N2O fluxes, especially in small eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.

Lake water is found to be pure with very low EC values even lesser than rainwater. This shows where lake water receives most of its contribution. A comprehensive and systematic study on the seasonal pattern of major ions (Cl-, PO4 (3-), HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), SO4 (2-), Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and SiO2) was carried out to understand the geochemical processes controlling water quality. There was marked seasonal variation observed for almost all ions. Factor analysis identifies geochemical controls, snow melting, and evaporative enrichment as main controlling factor. The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) value has increased in the post-monsoon probably due to higher atmospheric CO2 during winter. Overall, factor analysis identified processes like geochemical control, snowmelt water input, and evaporative enrichment in the pre-monsoon, atmospheric input and dilution of ions due to rainfall, microbial activities, and accumulation of weathered material lake system in the post-monsoon as governing processes switching among themselves in different seasons. HYSPILT back trajectory model was used to trace the source of long-range transport of pollutant. Results show for both the lakes that air arriving to the vicinity of the lake has an origin from the southeast direction during pre-monsoon and the mid-Gangetic plain during post-monsoon season, respectively. The results show that both the studied lakes have significant impacts of long-range transport of air pollutants rather than local interferences. Long-term monitoring of the fluctuation in key parameters can further verify the findings of this study.					; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	Prakash, Amit/0000-0001-9064-6590; Hoque, Raza/0000-0002-6375-9431; Kumar, Manish/0000-0002-3351-7298; 													1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2015	8	12					10597	10610		10.1007/s12517-015-1964-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-015-1964-7													WOS:000365450800030

Based on stratigraphy, sedimentology, geomorphology, and radiocarbon dating, this study identifies multiple intermediate- to large-lake intervals during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and the Last Glacial Maximum. Timing and magnitude of the Bonneville basin lake size change are compared with those of hemispheric-scale climate-change events reported from the Greenland ice sheet, southwestern North America winter precipitation, and East Asian monsoon delta O-18 records. The amount of precipitation received by surface water systems in the Bonneville basin appears to have increased significantly during the Greenland stades throughout the last half of MIS 3 and early MIS 2. The lake also underwent rapid, large amplitude oscillations during the last Glacial Maximum. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Ebru			Effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation and groundwater use on the contraction of Sultansazligi Wetland, Turkey	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The Sultansazligi Wetland, an internationally important aquatic site in Turkey, has suffered from a severe contraction since the early 1990s. To determine the factors affecting contraction, temporal variations of climatic and hydrogeologic variables have been investigated. Both the long-term climate change and the increasing surface and groundwater use are found to be responsible. Hydrologic analyses reveal an apparent correlation between increasing use of water resources and contraction in the wetland. Particularly, increasing use of groundwater and complete capture of springs and effluent streams once feeding the wetland are found to be the prime factors. Furthermore, a strong coherence is found between the temporal trend of the North Atlantic Oscillation and local precipitation, which is the main source of the basin's water excess and supplies the wetland. Future existence of the wetland depends on the application of thrifty water-use polices in irrigation.

Total P retention was approximately 36% of input for both years despite differences in flushing rate. Based on total P and hydrologic data, Spruce Knob Lake is eutrophic. Predicted spring total P concentrations from the Dillon-Rigler nutrient budget model were in close agreement with actual observed concentrations. Application of literature models predicting total P retention based on flushing rate to Spruce Knob Lake data resulted in close agreement with actual retention values. Models based on hydraulic load were inadequate when applied to Spruce Knob Lake. Relative P residence time values (lake total P/inflow total P) for both years indicated that the lake has a low sedimentation rate.

The development of such stratified populations is the result of in situ growth as well as recruitment of algae from other depths, and gradients of physical and chemical factors in lakes affect both processes. In Deming Lake, Minnesota [USA], nutrient enrichment and light reduction permitted O. agardhii var. isothrix to increase in abundance throughout the epilimnetic portion of isolated water columns. Apparently, this alga is neither as oligophotic nor as oligothermal as correlations of its population maxima with ambient light and temperature conditions might suggest. A likely consequence of the nutrient effects apparent in this study is that enrichment increases the portion of a lake''s photic zone that is inhabitable by this alga and, thereby, renders the lake more susceptible to invasion by it.																			0003-9136						1976	78	3					343	362																WOS:A1976CK83000004

Climate anomalies induced by the arctic and antarctic oscillations: Glacial maximum and present-day perspectives	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Based on multicentury coupled climate simulations of both modern and glacial maximum conditions, this study focuses on the impact of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) on the earth's surface climate. Intercomparison of the results obtained in numerical experiments for both climate epochs demonstrates that highly significant changes of surface climate are predicted to have occurred depending upon the phase of the AO and AAO. These climate anomalies differ substantially between the modern and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) states and exhibit a strong seasonal cycle under the latter conditions. Additional investigation has revealed that an intensification of the subtropical gyres in the North Atlantic and North Pacific that are induced during the positive phase of the AO plays a key role in the development of positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in midlatitudes. In the Southern Hemisphere, similarly significant and systematic climate shifts are shown to occur due to variations of the Antarctic Oscillation that are highlighted by a warming over the Antarctic Peninsula and midlatitudes during the positive phase of the AAO. Finally, the authors find that the temporal variability of the AO and of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is significantly anticorrelated, with this coupling being independent of the season under present-day conditions. Under LGM conditions, however, due to the intensified vigor of the atmospheric circulation, the coupling is found to be stronger during boreal winter.

However, previous streamflow reconstructions, based on dendrochronology and palaeo-flood sediments, are either discontinuous or cover only a few hundred years. Here, we provide a continuous palaeolimnological record of the streamflow of the Yarlung Tsangpo upstream. Our results reveal an unexpected streamflow rise after 6,000 years ago, indicating the Westerlies and glacier meltwater replaced Indian Summer Monsoon as the dominant driver of runoff. Furthermore, the relatively frequent palaeo-flood events during the early and late Holocene may be attributed to El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variance. These findings suggest the future occurrence of unsustainable streamflow and an increased flooding risk, as a result of weakening Westerlies, reduced glaciers, and strengthened ENSO activity under climatic warming.

The results indicate (i) fluctuating lake levels during the early Holocene. The period of relatively higher lake levels from increased precipitation efficiency was reached only similar to 7.2-6.0 cal kyr BP, possibly due to increased contribution from winter rainfall; (ii) the onset of aridity in NW India could have begun as early as similar to 5.3 cal kyr BP. Subsequently, there were multiple wet events but of shorter duration and smaller magnitude than during the mid Holocene; (iii) there is evidence of several short term climate events in the proxy record. However, in the absence of a rigorous chronological framework a detailed regional correlation is not possible at this stage. Finally, a comparison between marine and terrestrial records indicates that episodes of strongest and weakest monsoon winds were not always associated with wettest and driest episodes respectively in the NW Indian lakes.

J	Haukos, DA; Smith, LM				Haukos, DA; Smith, LM			Effects of moist-soil management on playa wetland soils	WETLANDS												We evaluated effects of moist-soil management on soils of eight playa wetlands for 2 years. Moist-soil management involves timed drawdown and irrigation of wetlands to promote germination, growth, and seed production of mudflat annuals for use by wintering waterfowl. Moist-soil management reduced soil resistance for germination (P = 0.02), raised pH closer to neutrality (P = 0.002), but had no effect on soil moisture in the top 4 cm of soil (P = 0.16; influence on soil moisture in the root zone is unknown) or on salinity measured as conductivity (P = 0.51). Moist-soil management did not affect nitrogen and phosphorus levels in playa soils over 2 seasons (P = 0.61). As a percentage of available nutrients, more soil nitrogen was lost during the wetter year compared to the dryer year (P = 0.02) - a trend that was reversed for soil phosphorus (P = 0.004). More nitrogen was lost in the wetter year (P = 0.02); whereas, more phosphorus was lost in the dryer year (P = 0.004). This indicates potential changes in limiting nutrients depending upon local precipitation events. Apparently, nutrient cycling is rapid in playas, producing large amounts of biomass despite having lower soil nutrient pools compared to other inland freshwater wetlands. Moist-soil management is a sustainable and compatible practice for playa wetlands because it enhances naturally occurring events.																			0277-5212					JUN	1996	16	2					143	149		10.1007/BF03160688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160688													WOS:A1996UU25900005

More specifically, vegetation monitoring is needed in the context of intensifying and mitigating factors of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Therefore, fast and low-cost, but reliable approaches are needed for monitoring the status of urban greening. A satellite-based monitoring scheme based on freely available data could ensure the provision of key urban ecosystem services, and guide both policy maker and practitioners. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of urbanization and urban green management on vegetation status of park trees during summer season in Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, using remote sensing. This city is known to be affected by air pollution and the UHI effect. Further, it is an example of a city with limited green spaces compared to other European cities. Hence, spatial data on vegetation status and potential impacts as a basis for management schemes are required to maintain a healthy urban green infrastructure. Vegetation indices related to chlorophyll, senescence, greenness and water stress were calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery as response variables to vegetation stress. Vegetation status was then predicted for each park using spatial environment factors (e.g. presence of irrigation systems) in a mixed model approach to account for heterogeneity among parks. The most important predictors of vegetation stress were irrigation systems, land surface temperature, distance to a lake and proximity to roads. However, the effect of these predictors on the vegetation status differed among parks. Therefore, a mixed effect model approach is suggested to quantify the effects of urbanization on green spaces in cities, and there is a high potential to use freely available satellite data for a spaceborne-monitoring service of urban green infrastructure.

Effects of mute swan grazing on a keystone macrophyte	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This study describes the early summer foraging behaviour of mute swans (Cygnus olor) on the River Frome, a highly productive chalk stream in southern England in which Ranunculus penicillatus pseudofluitans is the dominant macrophyte. 2. A daily maximum of 41 +/- 2.5 swans were present along the 1.1 km study reach during the study period (late May to the end of June). The river was the primary feeding habitat. Feeding activity on the river at dawn and dusk was much lower than during daylight, but we cannot rule out the possibility that swans fed during the hours of darkness. 3. The effects of herbivory on R. pseudofluitans biomass and morphology were quantified. Biomass was lower in grazed areas and swans grazed selectively on leaves in preference to stems. A lower proportion of stems from grazed areas possessed intact stem apices and flowering of the plant was reduced in grazed areas. 4. A model, based on the swans' daily consumption, was used to predict the grazing pressure of swans on R. pseudofluitans. The model accurately predicted the number of bird days supported by the study site, only if grazing was assumed to severely reduce R. pseudofluitans growth. The proportion of the initial R. pseudofluitans biomass consumed by a fixed number of swans was predicted to be greater when the habitat area was smaller, initial R. pseudofluitans biomass was lower and R. pseudofluitans was of lower food value. 5. We concluded that the flux of N and P through the study reach was largely unaffected by swan activity. The quality of R. pseudofluitans mesohabitat (the plant as habitat for invertebrates and fish) was significantly reduced by grazing which also indirectly contributed to reduced roughness (Manning's n) and by inference water depth. Wetted habitat area for fish and invertebrates would also be lowered over the summer period as a consequence of the reduction in water depth. It was estimated that, while grazing, an individual swan may eat the same mass of invertebrates per day as a 300-g trout. 6. There is a need to manage the conflict between mute swans and the keystone macrophyte, R. pseudofluitans, in chalk streams, and the modelling approach used here offers a potentially useful tool for this purpose.

Correlation coefficients between synchronous and asynchronous series of monthly water levels and 4 circulation indices were calculated. Based on Ward hierarchical grouping considering 156 correlation coefficients, the groups of lakes were designated due to the strength and term of relation of circulation indices with lake water levels. It was found that these links are not strong but noticeable. The strength of relationships varies in space and time, and the designated groups of lakes refer not only to the climatic diversity of the studied area, but also to some extent to the types of water levels regime. The observed relationships are the most important in the case of AO and NAO (particularly in winter period), and slightly weaker for EA and SCAND. The analysis used mean monthly water levels of 15 lakes in northern Poland from 1976-2015.

Despite being situated in geological settings with crystalline bedrock and thin, poorly buffered soils, and being impacted with high rates of acidic precipitation, none of the study lakes have declined in inferred pH based on scaled chrysophyte and diatom remains. In fact, the pH of one of the lakes, Coventry Lake, has significantly increased over the last century. Over the last similar to 44 to 69 years the amount of sulfur stored in the sediments from each lake increased from similar to two to three times resulting in mean rates of alkalinity generation ranging from 78 to 145 meq m(-2) yr(-1), significantly higher than the 45 to 48 meq m(-2) yr(-1) of hydrogen ions falling directly on the lake surfaces. In- lake alkalinity generation resulting from sulfate reduction has been sufficient to neutralize all of the acid falling directly onto the lake surfaces, as well as between 9% and 25% of the acid deposited onto the surrounding watersheds. Despite the increased importance of in- lake alkalinity generation, our findings support the hypothesis that significant amounts of alkalinity are also being generated in the catchments of the study lakes. The bulk of the increases in stored sulfur in all three lakes were as Fe sulfides and not in the form of organic sulfur, suggesting that the increases were the result of dissimilatory bacterial reduction of sulfate. As a result of the large increases in storage of Fe sulfides the ratio of total iron to chromium reducible sulfur ( Fe: CRS) has declined in all cores over time. Despite the overall decline in Fe: CRS in recent sediments, values are still largely above 3 in more recent sediments of two of the lakes. However, values of Fe: CRS have dropped below 1 in surface sediments of Uncas Lake, suggesting that in- lake loading of phosphorus may be responsible for a recent shift in the algal flora towards a slightly more eutrophic condition.

Radar remote sensing allows for discrimination of thermokarst ponds of different depths across large areas because different water depths produce different ice regimes in winter. In this study, patterns in the spatial distribution of ice-cover regimes of thermokarst ponds in a typical discontinuous permafrost region are first revealed. Correlations of these ice-cover regimes with the permafrost degradation states and thermokarst pond development in two historical phases were analyzed and compared. The results indicate that the ice-cover regimes of thermokarst ponds are affected by soil texture, permafrost degradation stage and permafrost depth. Permafrost degradation is difficult to assess directly from the coverage area of floating-ice ponds and the percentage of all thermokarst ponds consisting of such floating-ice ponds in a single year. Therefore, continuous monitoring of ice-cover regimes and surface areas can help to elucidate the hydrological trajectory of the thermokarst process and permafrost state.					; Wang, Lingxiao/KOC-2800-2024; Ludwig, Ralf/B-7939-2015	Wang, Lingxiao/0000-0003-2081-1022; Marzahn, Philip/0000-0001-6294-120X; 													1045-6740	1099-1530				OCT-DEC	2018	29	4					231	245		10.1002/ppp.1986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp.1986													WOS:000450129500001

In addition to the conventional single-pipe water-intake design, we proposed two new design options that can improve SWHP efficiency. The numerical model that pertains to a SWHPS is presented and parameters such as the fluid-intake temperature and energy-saving rate of the heat pump system are analyzed and compared with experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that on the basis of energy-saving rate, reducing the velocity of the water delivery has no significant influence while intake via multiple ports delivers superior efficiency. In conclusion, the water-intake design impacts on the SWHPS energy-saving rate because of its efficiency in drawing lower temperature water from a water retention body during summer. The method presented in this paper can provide a reference for a more detailed improvement on the energy performance of an open-loop SWHPS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Petrie, SA; Knapton, RW				Petrie, SA; Knapton, RW			Rapid increase and subsequent decline of zebra and quagga mussels in Long Point Bay, Lake Erie: Possible influence of waterfowl predation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Distribution and density of two introduced dreissenid specics of mollusks, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussel D, bugensis, were monitored ill the Inner Ba at Long Point, Lake Erie. 1991-1995. Since populations of certain waterfowl species have been reported to alter their dietary intake and migration patterns in response to the ready availability of zebra mussels, the percent occurrence of migration mussels in the diet of 12 duck species (552 birds) was studied concurrently, and several spring and fall aerial waterfowl surveys were flown between 1986 and 1997 (n = 75), to document changes in duck populations at Long Point. The first reproductive population of zebra mussels on the bay most likely appeared in 1990. After an initial rapid increase in density and colonization of the Inner Bay, zebra mussels began to steadily and consistently decline in absolute numbers, density per station and occupied area. Mean density per station in 1995, was 70% less than in 1991, the first year of rapid colonization, and 67% less than in 1992, the year of peak abundance in the bay (P < 0.05). Occupied area peaked in 1992, with 80% of sampling stations supporting mussels; the followings 3 years showed consistent declines in the proportion of stations suppporting mussels: 1993 = 75.9%. 1994 = 63.2% and 1995 = 57.1% (P < 0.05), Mussels in size class 0 to 5 mm were most abundant in 1991, 1993 and 1995, whereas those in size class 6 to 10 mm pre dominated in 1992 and 1994 (P < 0.05). Very few mussels over 15 mm were found. Lesser Scaup Aythya affinis (75.4 to 82.5 % occurrence), Greater Scaup A. marila (66.7 to 81.5 % occurrence), and Bufflehead Bucephala albeola (46.7 to 60 % occrrrrence), were the only three waterfowl species that consistently incorporated zebra mussels in their diet, and the mussel decline coincided with a substantial increase in the populations of these species at Long Point. Waterfowl days for Lesser and Greater Scaup combined increased rapidly from 38,500 in 1986 (prior to the zebra mussel colonization of Long Point) to 3.5 million 1997 (P = 0.012). Bufflehead days increased from 4,700 to 67,000 during the same period (P = 0.001). Oligotrophication of Lake Erie, through reduced plankton and chlorophyll concentration, has occured since the invasion of zebra mussels. probably a result of filtering activities of introduced mussels. While a reduction in plankton availability may have contributed to the zebra mussel decline, high rates of waterfowl prediction probably had the most substantial effect on mussel densities at Long Point, Waterfowl predation also probably influenced the size structure of the zebra mussel population. since waterfowl are size-selective foragers and increased water clarity would have facilitated their ability to select preferred medium and large size classes of mussels. Quagga mussels, which were first detected in 1993, experienced a decline in both density. and area occupied ol,er the next two years. Quagga mussels rarely attached to soft substrates, and their decline is possibly related to the decline of suitable hard substrates, such as zebra mussels, as well as to predation by waterfowl.																			0380-1330						1999	25	4					772	782		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70776-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70776-8													WOS:000085976300014

As a typical lake in this region, the Honghu Lake features water-surface area variations that are documented in this study based on high-resolution remote sensing images from the 1990s to 2013. The impact of human activities is analyzed by a novel method based on land use data. The relative impacts of each driving force are further distinguished by the statistical analysis method. Results show that the water-surface area has significant inter-annual and seasonal variabilities, and the minimum of which generally occurs in spring. The degree to which climate factors and land use structure affect the water-surface area varies between different stages. In the April-May period, the sum of the water demands of paddies and aquaculture has anegativeeffect thatis greater than the positive effect of the difference between the monthly precipitation and monthly evaporation. In the June-October period, the precipitation features a positive impact that is greater than the negative effect of the water demand of agriculture. Meanwhile, climate factors and human activities have no influence on the lake area in the November-March period. With the land use being altered when annual precipitations are close in value, paddy field areas decrease, ponds areas increase, and the water demand of agriculture rises in both flood and drought years. These findings provide scientific foundation for understanding the causes of water-surface area variations and for effectively maintaining the stability of the Honghu Lake area through adjustments in land use structure.					zhu, chuandong/JSK-3835-2023															2073-4441				JUN	2015	7	6					2881	2899		10.3390/w7062881	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w7062881													WOS:000361034400006

Water balance computation quantifies the relative importance of various hydrological processes including snowmelt, rainfall, inflows, evaporation, surface and subsurface outflows. the existence of this wetland is closely related to a lake upslope which provides the bulk of the water input. The ability of northern wetlands to absorb water input is limited by the frozen ground and the high specific retention of the peat, rendering the wetland a poor regulator of streamflow. Storage capacity increases in summer as evaporation reduces the moisture content of the peat. Subsurface flow remains insignificant because of the low hydraulic gradient and conductivity. Thus, when the water table lies within the peat layer, there is little wetland contribution to streamflow but when the water table lies above the ground during some intense storms, streamflow is rapidly increased by surface flow on the wetlands.					; Roulet, Nigel/W-3402-2019	Roulet, Nigel/0000-0001-9571-1929; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC 15	1986	89	1-2					73	91		10.1016/0022-1694(86)90144-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(86)90144-7													WOS:A1986F568100007

The monitoring wells were classified into three groups (residential area, agricultural area, and oil field area) depending on their land uses. During a 2-year period from 1999 to 2001 the monitoring wells were sampled every 3 months on a seasonal basis. Water quality assay consisted of 25 parameters including field parameters, nutrients, major ions, and trace elements. Occurrence and level of inorganics in groundwater samples were related to the land use and temporal change. Groundwater of the agricultural area showed lower levels of ferrous iron and nitrate than the residential area. The summer season data revealed more distinct differences in inorganic profiles of the two land use groundwater samples. There is a possible trend that nitrate concentrations in groundwater increased as the proportions of cultivated area increased. Water-soluble ferrous iron occurred primarily in water samples with a low dissolved oxygen concentration and/or a negative redox potential. The presence of brine waste in shallow groundwater was detected by chloride and conductivity in oil field area. Dissolved trace metals and volatile organic carbons were not in a form of concentration to be stressors. This study showed that the quality of shallow ground water could be related to regional geochemical stressors surrounding the take. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	KERFOOT, WC				KERFOOT, WC			COMPETITION IN CLADOCERAN COMMUNITIES - COST OF EVOLVING DEFENSES AGAINST COPEPOD PREDATION	ECOLOGY												An intimate relationship is apparent between fecundity and predator resistance in clones of the parthenogenic cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. Young of certain clones possess spines, slightly larger bodies and thicker carapaces, all of which frustrate the handling tactics of predatory copepods. During periods of abundant resources, the resistance is purchased at considerable cost, since eggs and developing young are carried in a restricted space, a special brood chamber formed from the dorsal portion of the carapace. The energy used in the development of protective defenses comes from the egg yolk supply, leading to larger eggs and smaller broods. During the spring algal bloom in Union Bay, Lake Washington [USA], long-featured lines carry few large eggs, while short-featured lines fill their pouches with many small eggs. The resulting differences in birth rate account for much of the rapid replacement of long-featured lines in the inshore regions after fishes remove predatory copepods.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1977	58	2					303	313		10.2307/1935605	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1935605													WOS:A1977DN32600006

However, the CH4 fluxes and their magnitudes in thermokarst lakes remain unclear due to limited research data, especially on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The magnitude and regulation of two CH4 pathways, ebullition and diffusion, were investigated in 32 thermokarst lakes on the TP during the summer of 2020. CH4 emissions from thermokarst lakes on the TP showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Diffusion fluxes in lakes averaged 2.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (ranging from 0.003 to 48.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), and ebullition fluxes in lakes averaged 6.6 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) (ranging from 0.002 to 140.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Together, these ebullition fluxes contributed 66.1 +/- 24.9% (ranging 5.4 to 100.0%) to the total (diffusion + ebullition) CH4 emissions, indicating the importance of ebullition as a major CH4 transport mechanism on the TP. In general, thermokarst lakes with higher CH4 diffusion fluxes and ebullition fluxes occurred in alpine meadows (2.5 +/- 5.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1); 8.2 +/- 20.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), followed by alpine steppes (0.6 +/- 5.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1); 0.7 +/- 10.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and desert steppes (0.2 +/- 0.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1); 0.6 +/- 0.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The organic matter contents in water and sediment were found to be important factors influencing the seasonal variations in CH4 diffusion fluxes. However, the ebullition CH4 fluxes did not show a clear seasonal variation pattern. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the large spatiotemporal variations in ebullition CH4 fluxes to improve the accuracy of large-scale estimations of CH4 fluxes in thermokarst lakes on the TP.

Polyesters as a Model System for Building Primitive Biologies from Non-Biological Prebiotic Chemistry	LIFE-BASEL												A variety of organic chemicals were likely available on prebiotic Earth. These derived from diverse processes including atmospheric and geochemical synthesis and extraterrestrial input, and were delivered to environments including oceans, lakes, and subaerial hot springs. Prebiotic chemistry generates both molecules used by modern organisms, such as proteinaceous amino acids, as well as many molecule types not used in biochemistry. As prebiotic chemical diversity was likely high, and the core of biochemistry uses a rather small set of common building blocks, the majority of prebiotically available organic compounds may not have been those used in modern biochemistry. Chemical evolution was unlikely to have been able to discriminate which molecules would eventually be used in biology, and instead, interactions among compounds were governed simply by abundance and chemical reactivity. Previous work has shown that likely prebiotically available alpha-hydroxy acids can combinatorially polymerize into polyesters that self-assemble to create new phases which are able to compartmentalize other molecule types. The unexpectedly rich complexity of hydroxy acid chemistry and the likely enormous structural diversity of prebiotic organic chemistry suggests chemical evolution could have been heavily influenced by molecules not used in contemporary biochemistry, and that there is a considerable amount of prebiotic chemistry which remains unexplored.					; Chandru, Kuhan/Y-9994-2018; Jia, Tony/AFN-5951-2022	Jia, Tony/0000-0001-5175-4599; Chandru, Kuhan/0000-0002-7438-4831; 														2075-1729				JAN	2020	10	1							6	10.3390/life10010006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life10010006								31963928					WOS:000534045200005

The Holocene silicon biogeochemistry of Yellowstone Lake, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Silicon (Si) is an essential macronutrient for diatoms, an important component of lacustrine primary productivity that represents a link between the carbon and silicon cycles. Reconstructions of lake silicon cycling thus provide an underexploited window onto lake and catchment biogeochemistry. Silicon isotope geochemistry has potential to provide these reconstructions, given the competing source and process controls can be deconvolved. The silica rich volcanic and hydrothermal systems in Yellowstone National Park are a great source of dissolved silicon into Yellowstone Lake, a system with high silicon, and thus carbon, export rates and the formation of diatom-rich sediment. Yellowstone Lake sediments should be an archive of past silicon biogeochemistry, although the effect of sublacustrine hydrothermal activity or hydrothermal explosion events is unclear. Here, we analysed lake water, tributaries, and hydrothermal vent fluids from Yellowstone Lake for their dissolved Si concentrations, isotope composition (630Si) and Ge/Si ratios to evaluate the sources of variability in the lake's Si cycle. Bulk elemental composition and biogenic SiO2 (bSiO2) content, together with 630Si and Ge/Si ratios from a single diatom species, Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis, were analysed in two sediment cores spanning the last 9880 cal. yr BP. We investigate these datasets to identify long term Holocene changes in hydrothermal activity and effects of large and short-term events i.e., hydrothermal and a volcanic eruption. Combinations of bSiO2, 630Si and Ge/Si with XRF and lithology data revealed that Yellowstone Lake has a resilient biogeochemical system: hydrothermal explosions are visible in the lithology but have no identifiable impact on bSiO2 accumulation or on the 630Si signature. Both cores show similarities that suggest a stable and homogeneous dSi source across the entire lake. A narrow range of 630Si and Ge/Si values suggests that the productive layer of the lake was well mixed and biogeochemically stable, with consistently high hydrothermal inputs of Si throughout the Holocene to buffer against the disturbance events. Variation in bSiO2 concentration through time is weakly correlated with an increase towards younger sediment in the 630Si fossil diatom record in both cores. This increase mirrors that seen in ocean records, and follows changes known in summer insolation, summer temperatures and lake water-column mixing since the deglaciation. This suggests that climate forcing, and soil formation ultimately govern the silicon isotope record, which we suggest is via a combination of changes in weathering stoichiometry, diatom production, and relative proportion of dSi sources.					; Frings, Patrick/B-8411-2018; Zahajská, Petra/S-3983-2017; Zahajska, Petra/S-3983-2017; Opfergelt, Sophie/L-2107-2015	Stadmark, Johanna/0000-0002-0591-6240; Frings, Patrick/0000-0002-1012-0642; Zahajska, Petra/0000-0001-5858-0616; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				DEC 15	2023	322								108419	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108419		NOV 2023											WOS:001121820500001

Productivity and depth regulate lake contributions to atmospheric methane	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Despite significant contributions of inland lakes to the global methane cycle, we lack a process-based understanding of what regulates inter-lake variation in methane emissions. Previous comparative work has identified a potential link between lake primary productivity and methane emissions; also, lab-scale experiments suggest that the addition of algal substrate to anoxic sediments rapidly enhances rates of methanogenesis. This existing work indicates that primary productivity could enhance lake contributions to the global methane cycle. However, a more systematic investigation of the links between lake primary production, methanogenesis, and methane emission to the atmosphere is required to quantify the implications of increased cultural eutrophication for methane evasion from lakes. Using paired measurements of methanogenesis and methane emissions on 16 north temperate lakes, we documented a positive relationship between lake productivity and sediment methanogenesis rates. However, increased methanogenesis rates did not result in an increase in diffusive methane emissions. Rather, they generated greater methane storage during summer stratification and enhanced methane emission to the atmosphere via bubbling (ebullition), dependent on site depth. Ebullition most frequently occurred at sites less than 6 m deep and where methanogenesis rates were high. The relationships between lake productivity, methanogenesis, and depth-dependent ebullition suggests it is likely that shallow, productive lakes contribute significantly more methane to the atmosphere than deep, clear lakes and will continue to do so in light of the growing prevalence of lake eutrophication.					; Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021	Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2016	61			1	SI		S51	S61		10.1002/lno.10247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10247													WOS:000388560900005

Seasonal physicochemical characteristics of thirty northern Ohio temporary pools along gradients of GIS-delineated human land-use	WETLANDS												Human development pollutes runoff and ground water. Temporary pools are good habitats to study the influence of general non-point source pollution because they are created by runoff and ground water, among other processes, which, in northern Ohio, can contain substances accumulated over the winter. Furthermore, little information on land-use effects on temporary pools exists. To ascertain if general human activities influenced the water quality of northern Ohio temporary pools, monthly measurements of pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, and depth were monitored from March-June 2004 in 30 dispersed pools of the Cuyahoga River basin, Ohio, USA. Nutrient measurements for most pools were taken in May and June 2004. Pools were located in ten sub-watersheds containing differing percentages of geographic information system (GIS)-delineated urban/ suburban and agricultural lands. General water quality characteristics of northern Ohio temporary pools were variable, both spatially and temporally. Nutrient levels were generally low (oligotrophic). Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the characteristics and percent land-use showed that conductivity and percent agriculture were positively correlated, while depth and percent urban were negatively correlated. Temporally, dissolved oxygen and depth showed fairly strong seasonal decreases from March-June. Some measurements from pools in mostly natural sub-watersheds suggested poor water quality. Although large-scale (watershed) land-use influences can affect the physicochemical nature of temporary pools, local anthropogenic influences, both past and present, probably also affect the quality of temporary pool wetlands.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2007	27	3					749	760		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[749:SPCOTN]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[749:SPCOTN]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000249694600027

Richard			Dynamically Downscaled Climate Change Projections for the South Asian Monsoon: Mean and Extreme Precipitation Changes and Physics Parameterization Impacts	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The extreme concentration of population over South Asia makes it critical to accurately understand the global warming impact on the South Asian monsoon (SAM), but the complex orography of the region makes future projections of monsoon intensity technically challenging. Here we describe a series of climate projections constructed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for South Asia to dynamically downscale a global warming simulation constructed using the Community Earth System Model under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. A physics-based miniensemble is employed to investigate the sensitivity of the projected change of the SAM to the implementation of different parameterization schemes in WRF. We analyze not only the changes in mean seasonal precipitation but also the impact of the warming process on precipitation extremes. All projections are characterized by a consistent increase in average monsoon precipitation and a fattening of the tail of the daily rainfall distribution (more than a 50% decrease in the return periods of 50-yr extreme rainfall events by the end of the twenty-first century). Further analysis based on one of the WRF physics ensemble members shows that both the average rainfall intensity changes and the extreme precipitation increases are projected to be slightly larger than expectations based upon the Clausius-Clapeyron thermodynamic reference of 7% degrees C-1 of surface warming in most parts of India. This further increase can be primarily explained by the fact that the surface warming is projected to be smaller than the warming in the midtroposphere, where a significant portion of rain originates, and dynamical effects play only a secondary role.

Gary			Effects of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and substrate on the development of metabolic phenotypes in age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens): implications for overwintering survival	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The impact of early rearing environment on phenotypic development in teleosts has been reasonably well-documented, but only recently has attention been paid to sturgeon raised for conservation purposes. In the present study, we hypothesized that rearing environment will result in the development of distinct metabolic phenotypes in age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and that these phenotypes will drive differential survival rates during a simulated overwintering event. Lake sturgeon gametes were fertilized and raised in one of three different environments: 16 degrees C+ 100% dissolved oxygen (DO), 14 degrees C+ 100% DO, and 16 degrees C + 80% DO, each with or without substrate. We measured standard metabolic rate, forced maximum metabolic rate, metabolic scope, energy density, hepatosomatic index, Fulton's condition factor, and enzyme activities associated with ATP production. Our results suggest that subtle changes in abiotic environments during early life history result in the development of distinct metabolic phenotypes during the first year of life. These have important implications for survival of age-0 lake sturgeon when stocked in the fall of their first year.

A similar to 0.4m diameter borehole was melted through 1087m of ice and maintained over similar to 10 days, allowing observation of ice properties and collection of water and sediment with various tools. Over this period, SALSA collected: 60 L of lake water and 10 L of deep borehole water; microbes >0.2 mu m in diameter from in situ filtration of similar to 100 L of lake water; 10 multicores 0.32-0.49m long; 1.0 and 1.76m long gravity cores; three conductivity-temperature-depth profiles of borehole and lake water; five discrete depth current meter measurements in the lake and images of ice, the lake water-ice interface and lake sediments. Temperature and conductivity data showed the hydrodynamic character of water mixing between the borehole and lake after entry.

Indicators of the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Freshwater ecosystems, including lakes, streams, and wetlands, are responsive to climate change and other natural and anthropogenic stresses. These ecosystems are frequently hydrologically and ecologically connected with one another and their surrounding landscapes, thereby integrating changes throughout their watersheds. The responses of any given freshwater ecosystem to climate change depend on the magnitude of climate forcing, interactions with other anthropogenic and natural changes, and the characteristics of the ecosystem itself. Therefore, the magnitude and manner in which freshwater ecosystems respond to climate change are difficult to predict a priori. We present a conceptual model to elucidate how freshwater ecosystems are altered by climate change. We identify eleven indicators that describe the response of freshwater ecosystems to climate change, discuss their potential value and limitations, and describe supporting measurements. Indicators are organized in three interrelated categories: hydrologic, water quality, and ecosystem structure and function. The indicators are supported by data sets with a wide range of temporal and spatial coverage, and they inform important scientific and management needs. Together, these indicators improve the understanding and management of the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.

In this study, we investigated the impact of human land use on the sources and biodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its potential impact on bacterial respiration in 10 independent catchments of the Lake Geneva basin. Sites were selected along a gradient of human disturbance (agriculture and urbanization) and were visited twice during the winter high-flow period. Bacterial respiration and DOM bioavailability were measured in the laboratory through standardized dark bioassays, and the influence of human land uses on DOM sources, composition and reactivity was assessed from fluorescence spectroscopy. Bacterial respiration was higher in agro-urban streams but was related to a short-term bioreactive pool (0-6 d of incubation) of autochthonous origin, whose relative contribution to the total DOM pool increased with the degree of human disturbance. On the other hand, the degradation of a long-term (6-28 d) bioreactive pool related to terrestrial DOM was independent from the catchment land use and did not contribute substantially to aquatic bacterial respiration. From a greenhouse gas emission perspective, our results suggest that human activities may have a limited impact on the net C exchanges between inland waters and the atmosphere, as most CO2 fixed by aquatic producers in agro-urban streams is cycled back to the atmosphere after biomineralization. Although seasonal and longitudinal changes in DOM sources must be considered, the implications of our results likely apply more widely as a greater proportion of autochthonous-DOM signature is a common feature in human-impacted catchments. Yet, on a global scale, the influence of human activities remains to be determined given the large diversity of effects of agriculture and urbanization on freshwater DOM depending on the local environmental context.					; Lambert, Thibault/M-7192-2017	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Perolo, Pascal/0000-0001-7372-1181; Lambert, Thibault/0000-0002-7666-5370													1726-4170	1726-4189				JAN 11	2022	19	1					187	200		10.5194/bg-19-187-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-187-2022													WOS:000743991200001

Efflux contour maps show a significant decline in the areas and rates of CO2 emission from 1995 to 1997. The emission rate fell from 350 t d(-1) (metric tons per day) in 1995 to 130 t d(-1) in 1997. The trend suggests a return to background soil CO2 efflux levels by early to mid 1999 and may reflect exhaustion of CO2 in a deep reservoir of accumulated gas and/or mechanical closure or sealing of fault conduits transmitting gas to the surface. However, emissions rose to 220 t d(-1) on 23 September 1997 at the onset of a degassing event that lasted until 5 December 1997.

A total of 138 bacterial strains were recovered from the 11 different depths of the ice core. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, the 138 isolates could be categorized into 25 phylotypes belonging to phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. All isolates had 16S rRNA sequences similar to previously determined sequences (97.2-100%). No correlation was observed in the distribution of the isolates at the various depths either at the phylum, genus or species level. The 25 phylotypes varied in growth temperature range, tolerance to NaCl, growth pH range and ability to produce eight different extracellular enzymes at either 4 or 18 degrees C.

In this study, we aimed to detect the bacterial quality, the frequency of bacterial antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, and bioindicator bacteria in the water samples taken from Sapanca Lake in the period between 2008 and 2010. The resistance of bacterial isolates to certain antibiotics and heavy metal salts was investigated using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration techniques. Bacterial metabolic reactions were tested using the VITEK 2 Compact 30 micro identification system for identification of cultivable bacteria. Twenty-seven bacteria species belonging to three classesGammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Flavobacteriawere recorded for the first time in Sapanca Lake. The highest indicator bacteria were recorded as 71 +/- 3.1x10(4) CFU/100ml in the summer season. The highest bacterial resistance was recorded as 90.47% against vancomycin in a total of 84 strains. Ampicillin (88.10%) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (64.29%) followed them. The resistance varied between 10.71 and 59.52% against cefuroxime, kanamycin, aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and oxacillin. The highest frequency against heavy metal salts was recorded as 74.19% against NiCl2. The heavy metal resistance against Cu, Zn, Hg, and Cd detected as 52.38%, 46.42%, 33.33%, and 26.19%, respectively. The results showed that the occurrence of heavy metals and antibiotic sources in Sapanca Lake induced a tolerance in bacteria for the metal salts and antibiotic derivatives tested. The fluctuations in the indicator bacteria and the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria also showed the possibility that the coastal areas of Sapanca Lake had been exposed to contamination due to inadequate sewage treatment.

In total, 99 different g23 clones were obtained. Approximately half of the clones fell into paddy groups, whereas the rest belonged to one of several groups containing only clones from upland black soils or remained ungrouped, suggesting that the T4-type phage communities in the upland black soil were relatively similar to those in paddy field soils but that specific communities exclusively inhabit the upland black soil. UniFrac analysis of all of the g23 clones obtained from various environments indicated that the T4-type phage communities varied among marine, lake, paddy field soil and upland soil environments and that the T4-type phage communities in upland black soils varied by sampling location.

J	Abebe, E; Mees, J; Coomans, A				Abebe, E; Mees, J; Coomans, A			Nematode communities of Lake Tana and other inland water bodies of Ethiopia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Free-living nematodes from littoral benthie sediments of four lakes, two rivers and a hot spring in Ethiopia are studied. Populations of nematodes encountered are identified to the species level. The general nematode (generic and species) composition of the lakes, rivers and hot spring are appraised by giving special emphasis to the nematodes from L. Tana, i.e. three sites where different environmental factors come into play were considered. Gelda is a site close to a river inlet (River Gelda), Gedero is a site exposed to strong wind action while Zegie is a secluded site protected by a land mass from any strong wind action. Nematode communities were identified using classification and ordination techniques. The identified communities are then characterised with respect to species composition, biomass, density, diversity, size structure, feeding type and maturity index. Also, the vertical distribution of nematodes is examined at the community and species level. An attempt has been made to associate these variations with the considered environmental factors viz. site, water depth, sediment depth, median grain size and percentage of mud in the sediment. Median grain size and percentage of mud varied over the three sites with the lowest grain size and the highest percentage of mud in Gelda. The incoming river is regarded responsible for the high mud content at this site. The composition of the nematode communities from the lakes, rivers and hot spring by and large was typically freshwater. The highest number of species (40 species) was recorded from L. Tana (a lake relatively intensively sampled) whereas the lowest number was recorded front the saline lake, Abiyata (2 species). Both species in the latter belong to the genus Monhystrella. The complete dominance of species of this genus in L. Abiyata and its presence in the saline lakes and hot spring is argued to be associated with their opportunistic nature and their high temperature dependency and their capacity to withstand high osmotic stress conditions. The role played by salinity in the distribution of nematodes in inland water bodies is considered vital. The occurrence of two species of the genus Udonchus in River Abbay where an outlet of a waste disposal scheme of a textile factory is situated, and their absence in any other site coupled with the habitual presence of one of the two species in mineral waters are used to argue that the genus may be an indicator of some kind of environmental (chemical?) stress. Five nematode communities are identified in L. Tana, viz. Gelda at 0.5 m, Gelda at 1.5 m, Zegie at 0.5 m, Zegie at 1.5 m and Gedero. The vulnerability of Gedero to strong wind action is maintained to be the main reason for the absence of a significant difference in nematode community at the two water depths at this site. The presence of few dominant species characterised four of the five communities. Factors that account for differences in species composition and abundance are discussed. Local conditions are thought to be important in the different communities in L. Tana. A strategy in niche partitioning is suggested to be the main driving force behind the composition of few most dominant species which (in L. Tana and other reviewed lakes) invariably was a combination of a deposit feeder(s) and an omnivore/predator(s) species. In general, nematode diversity in L. Tana was comparable to that found in oligotrophic and mesotrophic freshwater lakes. Nematode diversity varied over the different communities in L. Tana. The two communities in Gelda were less divers and were composed of smaller species than those communities in Zegie and Gedero, and this is explained by the muddy nature of the sediment in Gelda. Most of the difference in diversity among communities could be explained at the genus level. Density and biomass varied significantly over the five communities, density (m(-2)) was in the range 91 x 10(3)-504.7 x 10(3) and biomass was in the range 0.02-0.33 g dry wt/m(2) (0.01-0.16 gC/m(2)). Deposit feeders dominated in all communities followed by omnivore/predators. Epistrate feeders had the lowest abundance. In all sites, except Gelda at 0.5 m, a large proportion of the nematodes occurred in the uppermost sediment layer (0-1 cm). The number of species also decreased with increasing sediment depth. A relatively higher proportion of nematodes were found in the surface sediment at deeper water depth (1.5 m) than at shallower depth (0.5 in). The vertical profile of biomass followed that of density.

J	LEMLY, AD; ESCH, GW				LEMLY, AD; ESCH, GW			BLACK-SPOT CAUSED BY UVULIFER-AMBLOPLITIS (TREMATODA) AMONG JUVENILE CENTRARCHIDS IN THE PIEDMONT AREA OF NORTH-CAROLINA	PROCEEDINGS OF THE HELMINTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Prevalence and range of intensity of metacercariae of U. ambloplitis were determined from juvenile centrarchids (all < 70 mm total length) in 43 lakes, streams and ponds in the Piedmont area of North Carolina during the summer months of 1980-1982. The parasite occurred within 63% of the habitats checked. Metacercariae were most prevalent in bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus. The parasite was present in 5 of 8 spp. of centrarchids examined. Because juvenile centrarchids are restricted to the shallow parts of the littoral zone by predatory largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides] similar levels of infection should be expected among the various host species. There was a great amount of variability in prevalence and range of infection. Such variability probably is due to differences in inherent susceptibility among the different species of host.																			0018-0130						1985	52	1					30	35																WOS:A1985ADS2100003

Recent infestation of forest stands by spruce beetles does not predict habitat use by little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in southwestern Yukon, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Insect outbreaks affect forest structure which may have significant effects on the habitat of other animals. Forest-dwelling insectivorous bats are likely affected by associated changes in the abundance of roost trees and insect prey, altered foraging and flying efficiency, and predation risk. We examined the short-term effects (3-13 years post-infestation) of an outbreak of spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) on the habitat use of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in the boreal forest of the southwestern Yukon, Canada. We measured bat activity, using Anabat II bat detectors, in 90 forested stands that had experienced from 0 to 90% tree mortality due to spruce beetles. We used generalized linear models to assess whether bat activity varied with tree mortality, season, tree density, canopy closure, or distance to the nearest lake or town. Bat activity did not vary significantly with tree mortality, season, or canopy closure, but decreased with increasing tree density. Bat activity was significantly greater in areas close to both the nearest lake and nearest town, and was low in areas that were far from either. Our results indicate that in the short-term, habitat use by little brown bats was not related to the severity of spruce beetle infestation, but suggest that in the long-term, bats may be positively affected by decreased tree density as beetle-killed trees fall down.

In this study, a series of experiments, along with field observation from 2007 to 2016, were carried out to identify the hydrodynamic parameters that drive the algal bloom in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China, and their threshold values were determined. The results show that algae concentration was markedly diluted with a short retention time, and the threshold value of the retention time to avoid algal bloom was approximately less than 3 days. With strong stratification, the algae concentration was able to approach to the level of algal bloom in 10 days, even when the water temperature is lower than 12 degrees C. The ratio of mixing depth to euphotic depth (Zm/Ze) had significant negative correlations with both algae concentration and algae specific growth rate (SGR). The field monitoring data indicated that Zm/Ze is an important hydrodynamic parameter which sensitively affects algae growth and concentration. This study made the first attempt to determine Zm/Ze >2.8 to restrain algal bloom in the TGR. Our findings shed light on the influence of critical depth on the algal bloom in the TGR, and the results can serve to control algal bloom in reservoirs through discharge operation.					; Ma, Jun/IUQ-7857-2023; Wei, ChenYu/ODJ-1205-2025; Yang, Hong/C-1739-2008; Liu, Defu/L-1307-2019	Yang, Zhengjian/0009-0002-5905-7864; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR 1	2022	211								118030	10.1016/j.watres.2021.118030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.118030		JAN 2022						35065341					WOS:000758588000002

We consider the AR-a one-in-500-year event-as the trigger for the devastating Beach Road Landslide (BRLS), which destroyed or damaged four residences and took the lives of two people. The BRLS started as a debris avalanche and transitioned into a debris flow, with a total approximate landslide volume of 187,100 m(3). Geomorphic analysis using lidar data identified evidence of paleo-landslides and displaced masses of rock, one of which served as the source area for the BRLS. Significant structural features in the weak ultramafic bedrock defined the head scarp area and formed the failure plane. This study illustrates the importance of identifying pre-existing landslide features and source areas likely to produce future landslides. As an increase in ROS events is projected for Southeast Alaska with warmer and wetter winters, we recommend the development of an AR scale coupled with geological information for the region, to enhance warnings to residents in landslide-prone areas.					; Grilliot, Michael/R-1183-2019	Grilliot, Michael/0000-0001-8233-0342; Baichtal, Jim/0000-0003-3876-3110; Wartman, Joseph/0000-0001-7659-7198; Darrow, Margaret/0000-0003-4078-4746; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				SEP	2022	19	9					2177	2188		10.1007/s10346-022-01899-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01899-3		JUN 2022											WOS:000804513500002

Patterns of habitat use and selection by the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris): a landscape-scale analysis	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Habitat selection analysis provides useful information on how animals become distributed in response to spatial heterogeneity. Here, we analyze the habitat use and selection of different water bodies (marsh, swamps and round shallow lakes) by capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and their relation to environmental variables during contrasting climate-hydrological seasons in the Esteros del Ibera (Corrientes, Argentina). We evaluated the intensity of use by capybaras through the total number of individuals (abundance) in each water body, the number and mean size of social groups, and the physical and vegetation characteristics of the environment. The capybaras used marsh and swamps according to availability in both seasons, while they used rounded shallow lakes less than their available would suggest in summer. The use intensity of different rounded shallow lakes estimated based on group size did not show significant differences. In contrast, significant differences were observed when evaluated by the number of individuals in each rounded shallow lake. Different intensity of use was closely associated with environmental and vegetation characteristics. The results show that habitat suitability for capybaras is associated with vegetation cover and "embalsados" in the low-lying area rather than with the morphometry of the rounded shallow lakes. The pattern of habitat selection may depend on forage quality, water availability for thermoregulation and mating, and presence of shelter and resting sites. On the other hand, the present study shows how the size, shape and the abundance of different types of water bodies affect population abundance and density.

The objective of this study was to use quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methodologies to measure N. fowleri and E. coli concentrations within a Texas reservoir in late summer, and to determine if concentrations of N. fowleri and E. coli were statistically correlated. N. fowleri was detected in water samples from 67% of the reservoir sites tested, with concentrations ranging up to an estimated 26 CE (cell equivalents)/100 mL. E. coli was detected in water samples from 60% of the reservoir sites tested, with concentrations ranging up to 427 CE/100 mL. In this study, E. coli concentrations were not indicative of N. fowleri concentrations.

The main updates include a replacement of the water-only lake module by the common land model lake module (CoLM-lake) with a more realistic snow-ice-water-soil framework, a parameterization scheme for rice paddies added in the vegetation module, renewed parameterizations of snow cover fraction and snow surface albedo to accommodate the varied snow aging effect during different stages of a snow season, a revised parameterization to calculate the threshold temperature to initiate freeze (thaw) of soil water (ice) rather than being fixed at 0 degrees C in BCC_AVIM1.0, a prognostic phenology scheme for vegetation growth instead of empirically prescribed dates for leaf onset/fall, and a renewed scheme to depict solar radiation transfer through the vegetation canopy. The above updates have been implemented in BCC_AVIM2.0 to serve as the land component of the BCC Climate System Model (BCC_CSM). Preliminary results of BCC_AVIM in the ongoing Land Surface, Snow, and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show that the overall performance of BCC_AVIM2.0 is better than that of BCC_AVIM1.0 in the simulation of surface energy budgets at the seasonal timescale. Comparing the simulations of annual global land average before and after the updates in BCC_AVIM2.0 reveals that the bias of net surface radiation is reduced from -12.0 to -11.7 W m(-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced from 20.6 to 19.0 W m(-2); the bias and RMSE of latent heat flux are reduced from 2.3 to -0.1 W m(-2) and from 15.4 to 14.3 W m(-2), respectively; the bias of sensible heat flux is increased from 2.5 to 5.1 W m(-2) but the RMSE is reduced from 18.4 to 17.0 W m(-2).					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019														2095-6037	2198-0934				OCT	2019	33	5					851	869		10.1007/s13351-019-9016-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-019-9016-y													WOS:000494484300005

Pond hydrology and dissolved carbon dynamics at Polar Bear Pass wetland, Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada	ECOHYDROLOGY												A large number of wetlands, lakes and ponds exist in northern Canada, Alaska and Siberia, and the hydrologic and ecological processes in these water bodies are now responding to a changing climate. A large wetland, Polar Bear Pass (PBP), situated in the middle of Bathurst Island is considered to be one of the most important ecological sites in the region. Numerous ponds exist at PBP and are connected to their surrounding watersheds by streams and groundwater inflow, receiving varying amounts of water and nutrients. In 2008 and 2009, the representative hydrology of typical ponds at PBP along with their quantity of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) was evaluated. Pond DOC and DIC loads and composition differ depending on the presence or absence of one or more hydrologic linkages that a pond has with its catchment. Elevated DOC loads were mostly of terrestrial origin and occurred in ponds receiving meltwater from snowbeds and discharge from hillslope creeks. The seasonal shift in connectivity of a pond to its catchment was critical in controlling DOC loads and concentrations. The frequency and duration of summer precipitation had a strong control on pond hydrologic connectivity and elevated the contribution of terrestrial DOC from wetland to ponds, especially ones that were hydrologically connected. The estimated DOC yields from wet meadow catchments highlight their importance as a source of carbon to pond ecosystems downstream. These wetland areas and ponds are potentially significant pools of carbon and are sensitive to future climate changes in permafrost-dominated environments.

The resultant crater is a window into the regional water table. The surface of the contemporary central pan is 25 m below the adjacent terrain, coincident with the late Holocene regional water table modified by local evaporative processes. Shielded from aeolian deflation by the crater rim, the central depression has slowly filled with dust, sand, and chemical precipitates, estimated to be 20-100 m thick based on geophysical surveys, one of the few continuous depocenters in the Australian Arid Zone. The nature of the crater's sediment fill is controlled by interactions between the water table, primarily in response to changes in summer monsoon rain, changes in the delivery of sand and dust to the crater by the prevailing easterly winds, and the level of the sedimentary fill surface. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and C-14 dates constrain an age model indicating the upper 10 m of sediment fill recovered from the central pan span the past similar to 60 ka. The lowest 3 m consist of clayey sand deposited in perennial water during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The water table subsequently dropped rapidly similar to 35 ka and remained more than 7 m below the late Holocene level through most of MIS 2, during which 2 m of sandy clay was deposited on a dry crater floor, confirming a dry and dusty Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate. By 14 ka a rising water table intersected the crater surface, modifying the upper 50 cm of LGM sediment, and syndepositionally modifying another 60 cm of subsequent sandy clay deposition. Aeolian sediment delivery effectively ceased similar to 13 ka, and the upper 4.8 m is a gypsum-dominated precipitate, which initially accumulated rapidly, before equilibrating with the late Holocene water table shortly after 6 ka. Lacustrine carbonate encrustations on rocks at the base of the crater wall and similar to 4 m above the central pan with C-14 ages >40 ka document a time when regional groundwater maintained a water body in the crater 3.5 -4.5 m above the modern groundwater level. The crater wall deflected the prevailing easterly winds, creating a horseshoe-dune extending westerly on both sides of the crater, with an extension rate of 35 m ka(-1). An augered hole through the northern dune revealed 10 m of sediment overlying ferricrete. The lowest meter is a mixture of broken ferricrete and sand that we interpret to be debris from the bolide impact. Three OSL dates through the dune project an age for the debris-dune contact of 120 +/- 10 ka. Changes in physical properties and bulk sediment delta C-13 through the 9 m of aeolian sediment indicate the lowest 1.8 m was deposited during MIS 5 (120-85 ka), under a uniformly wetter climate than present. The overlying 4.3 m of sediment was deposited between 85 and 14 ka (MIS 4, 3, 2) and exhibits transitional characteristics between the lower unit and the upper 3.8 of sand, which was deposited primarily during the Holocene. Large changes in the regional water table occurred over the past 60 ka, including an LGM water table persistently >= 7 m lower than late Holocene levels, and 3.5-4.5 m higher prior to 40 ka, plausibly in MIS 5, indicative of a stronger Australian Summer Monsoon than at any time subsequently. Age models and sediment properties from the two sedimentary records indicate the crater was formed >60 ka and most likely -120 ka, more recently than previous estimates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Research indicated that the nitrification was limited by stagnated growth of the nitrifying bacteria due to low phosphate concentrations at low temperatures (0-3degreesC). Phosphoric acid was dosed prior to the RSF (dose 35-50 mug PO43- -P.I-1) to Stimulate bacteria growth. Two weeks after starting the addition, ammonium removal in the RSF had recovered. AWS is conducting research on alternatives for production capacity extension. Several alternatives involve the construction of an additional RSF prior to the reservoir. Pilot experiments on RSF prior to the reservoir show that complete nitrification in these additional RSF is possible. The phosphate concentration should amount at least 10 mug PO43- -P.I-1. A model has been developed to predict nitrification In RSF. The model confirms the results from both the River-Lake Waterworks' RSF as from the pilot RSF. The model is used for process control and scenario studies.					; Hofman, Jan/U-6342-2019	Rietveld, Luuk/0000-0003-3227-6100; Hofman, Jan/0000-0002-5982-603X; 													1606-9749		1-900222-63-9				2002	2	1					37	46		10.2166/ws.2002.0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2002.0005													WOS:000175402000005

Hot-spring inflow can result in complex lake hydro- and geochemistry, but also buffers against the desiccation of closed-basin lakes in dry climate regimes. Consequently, hydrothermally fed lakes can potentially provide continuous sedimentary records from regions where other types of paleoenvironmental archives are lacking. This is illustrated by Nasikie Engida, a shallow hypersaline and alkaline (soda) lake in the semiarid Rift Valley of southern Kenya. Here, inflow of hot-spring water has maintained a shallow but permanent water body and continuous deposition of sediments through past climate episodes when many other lakes in the eastern (Gregory) branch of the East African Rift System stood dry. We present the first data on late-Holocene sedimentation in this remarkable lacustrine system, typified by authigenic nahcolite [NaH(CO3)] formation during part of its recorded history. Our data include measurements of bulk-sediment and mineralogical composition, clastic-mineral grain size and magnetic susceptibility. Analytical issues related to the large amount of salts within the sediments, both as crystals and in solution in the pore water, are discussed. We also present exploratory time series of the stable-isotope composition of bulk organic matter and authigenic nahcolite. Core lithostratigraphy and preliminary radiocarbon dating indicate that Nasikie Engida has accumulated finely laminated sediments continuously since ca. 2850 cal year BP, which is remarkable given its current maximum depth of only 1.6 m. Synsedimentary nahcolite appears abruptly similar to 2260 cal year BP and since then has been deposited regularly, in the form of distinct pure layers up to several cm thick. Its formation has been enabled by high pCO(2), supplied principally from geothermal sources, accumulating in a high-density brine. Although Nasikie Engida has likely been saline over the entire time span covered by the studied sediment sequence, variation in nahcolite deposition and bulk-sediment composition suggests multi-decadal to centennial oscillations in water-column stability and stream inflow driven by variation in climatic moisture balance. Further analyses of this paleoenvironmental archive may thus produce the first continuous climate-proxy record from a vast dry region of equatorial East Africa. Moreover, Nasikie Engida's extraordinary setting makes it a unique modern analogue for the interpretation of ancient nahcolite-bearing salt-lake deposits.					; Goderis, Steven/F-9908-2011; De Cort, Gijs/J-9565-2019	De Cort, Gijs/0000-0001-7437-4943; Goderis, Steven/0000-0002-6666-7153; Mees, Florias/0000-0002-6190-8384; Sinnesael, Matthias/0000-0003-0354-8250; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2019	62	3					279	300		10.1007/s10933-019-00092-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00092-2													WOS:000484934500004

Energy budget for a rock avalanche: fate of fracture-surface energy	LANDSLIDES												A detailed energy budget of a rock avalanche at Lake Coleridge, New Zealand, included fragments as small as 70 nm in diameter in the debris particle-size distribution, and used ultrasonic disaggregation of agglomerates formed during emplacement of the deposit to properly sample the fine fragments created during the rock avalanche. Using the maximum likely value of potential energy released during the debris fall and runout, and minimum values of energy lost to friction and of energy used in creating new rock surface area by fragmentation, the energy budget showed a substantial energy deficit; the available potential energy almost matched the energy lost to friction, leaving very little energy available for creating the new surface. This deficit was much less prominent if sub-micron fragments were ignored as in earlier energy budgets, because about 90% of total fragment surface area occurred on sub-micron fragments. Close examination of possible sources of error in the calculated budget leads to the conclusion, supported by published data, that only a small proportion of the energy used to create new rock surface transforms to surface energy, while a large proportion of it remains available in the form of elastic body-wave energy.																			1612-510X	1612-5118				JAN	2020	17	1					3	13		10.1007/s10346-019-01224-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-019-01224-5													WOS:000512067600002

The influence of pH on dissolved organic matter fluorescence in inland waters	ANALYTICAL METHODS												Fluorescence is an easily available analytical technique used to assess the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite widespread use, there has been some confusion about how robust fluorescence spectroscopy is to differences in solution pH. Here we assess fluorescence characteristics of three natural water samples and one commercially available standard (Nordic Reservoir) by modifying the pH across a range from 3.5 to 9.0 at 0.5 pH increments. We used two statistical approaches to assess if fluorescence intensity shifted significantly across this pH range. We identified that humic-like and protein-like fluorescence was largely stable within the pH range of 5.5 to 7.5, which represents 80% of Swedish lakes and streams. Likewise, we found that the three commonly used fluorescence indices were robust across the full pH range tested with the exception of the humification index, which had a narrower range of stability. The commerical humic substance sample was highly unstable with changes to pH in the regions of protein-like fluorescence being particularly sensitive. One of our conclusions is that differences in fluorescence intensity in the pH range of 5.5 to 7.5, typical for most inland waters, are generally minor. We recommend adjusting the pH when samples fall outside this region and to be especially careful in interpreting results from commercial humic substances.

The aim of the study was to develop an index to assess trophic status of Hungarian lakes as suggested by the Water Framework Directive. In spring of 2005 and 2006, epiphytic diatom samples were collected from 83 shallow lakes. Weighted average method was used to develop and test the TP model. In the developed TP model correlation between the observed and diatom inferred TP was high (r(2) = 0.96, n = 67). The optimum and tolerance TP parametrics of 127 species were determined and trophic indicator and sensibility values were defined for the Trophic Diatom Index for Lakes (TDIL). The TDIL was applicable to assess the ecological status of Hungarian shallow lakes. According to the TDIL the ecological status of 4 lakes were in excellent, 25 in good, 21 in medium, 21 in tolerable and 12 in bad status.

Together with previously published data of six R chondrites, exposure ages are calculated and compared with those of ordinary chondrites. A number of pairings, especially between those from Northwest Africa (NWA), are suggested, so that only 23 individual falls are represented by the 39 R chondrites discussed here. Eleven of these meteorites, or almost 50%, contain solar gases and are thus regolithic breccias. This percentage is higher than that of ordinary chondrites, howardites, or aubrites. This may imply that the parent body of R chondrites has a relatively thick regolith. Concentrations of heavy noble gases, especially of Kr, are affected by the terrestrial atmospheric component, which resides in weathering products. Compared to ordinary chondrites, Xe-129/Xe-132 ratios of R chondrites are high.																			1086-9379	1945-5100				APR	2005	40	4					557	571		10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00963.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00963.x													WOS:000230685400005

Lateglacial and Holocene hydroclimate inferred from a groundwater flow-through lake, Northern Rocky Mountains, USA	HOLOCENE												Climate-driven variations in lake-groundwater exchange are recorded by sediments in groundwater-dominated lakes. A groundwater flow-through lake in west-central Montana (USA) registers latest Pleistocene and Holocene hydroclimatic variation in fluid and solute balance, as controlled by rates and timing of groundwater recharge. Early Holocene warming occurred under conditions of relative aridity and low groundwater throughflow, punctuated by a c. 450-yr episode of lake dilution centered on 11 000 cal. yr BP. Maximum evaporative concentration of lake waters, registered in both delta O-18 values and mineralogy of endogenic carbonates, coincided with the early-Holocene peak in insolation seasonality at about 9750 cal. yr BP. Subsequently, progressively decreasing lake residence time drove a sustained long-term decline in salinity while having a very subdued effect on mean delta O-18 values. e explain this decoupling by (1) limits placed on oxygen isotope sensitivity by groundwater throughflow, and (2) a shift toward greater summer rain contribution to lake inflow after mid-Holocene time. Superimposed multidecadal- and century-scale variation in lake-groundwater exchange generated high-frequency but low-amplitude isotopic oscillations throughout the record. High rates of groundwater throughflow maintaining low lake salinity similar to that observed today were established around 1400 cal. yr BP. e infer reduced regional stream baseflow, decrease in permanent wetlands (relative increase in ephemeral wetlands) and enhanced lake and wetland salinity prior to this time, relative to the late Holocene.

J	Barnekow, L				Barnekow, L			Holocene tree-line dynamics and inferred climatic changes in the Abisko area, northern Sweden, based on macrofossil and pollen records	HOLOCENE												Lake-sediment records of pollen and macroscopic plant remains of terrestrial origin provide evidence of long-term changes in forest composition close to the altitudinal tree-line in the Abisko area, northernmost Sweden. A dominance of mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. tortuosa (Ledeb.) Nyman) with a field-layer of ferns, grasses and sedges suggests that an oceanic climate with relatively high precipitation existed during the early Holocene. Macrofossils of mountain birch were found 300-400 m above the present tree-line which corresponds to a 1.5-2 degrees C higher summer temperature than at present. Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) was present to some extent at altitudes above its present limit during the early Holocene. A pronounced expansion of pine took place above its present limit around 6300 cal. BP (5500 BP). This is interpreted as a result of successively drier and more continental climatic conditions. A decreased abundance of pine from c. 5200 cal. BP (4700 BP), followed by a gradual retraction of the upper limit of pine during the later part of the Holocene, can be attributed mainly to long-term changes in solar radiation. A decline in the upper limit of pine of c. 175 m since 4500 cal. BP (4000 BP) is believed to represent a decrease in growing-season temperature of c. 1.5 degrees C.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	1999	9	3					253	265		10.1191/095968399676322637	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968399676322637													WOS:000080218500001

As part of a larger, ongoing study, stomach contents were examined from 928 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected from Little Bay de Noc, Lake Michigan, June through October, 1988. Diet through August consisted of several taxa considered typical for yellow perch. During September and October, 116 perch (76-213 mm TL) contained 1-110 (mean = 17.4) B. cederstroemi. Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) was the only other fish species found to have ingested B. cederstroemi in Little Bay de Noc. Within individual fall net samples, from 18 to 72% of the yellow perch contained B. cederstroemi. Yellow perch appeared to prefer B. cederstroemi (when available) over other food items that had composed their diet earlier in the year. Age-0 yellow perch consumed B. cederstroemi, but 1- to 4-yr-old fish may have been more efficient in handling the cladoceran. This paper presents base-line data for fish diets during the early expansion of B. cederstroemi in a new environment.																			0380-1330						1991	17	2					281	285		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71364-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71364-6													WOS:A1991FZ32800014

In this study, patterns of abundance and species richness of plant-dwelling chironomids were investigated within and among stands of three macrophyte species in oxbow lakes along the River Tisza (Hungary). Chironomids colonized macrophytes rapidly and most species occupied the habitat before it had completely developed in June. Assemblage structure and abundance of particular species varied considerably between plant species, oxbow lakes and summer months in a characteristic succession from June to August indicating the presence of dynamic selection mechanisms. Abundance of most species, except Endochironomus tendens, total chironomid abundance, within-sample and total species diversity were highest on the submerged plant Ceratophyllum demersum, and most species occurred at the beginning of the colonization succession, in June. The contribution of oxbow lakes (20.3%) and the month sampled (20.3%) to total chironomid diversity was higher than would be expected by chance alone and the contribution of within (19.7%) and between samples (13.5%) to total chironomid diversity was lower than would be expected by chance alone. We conclude that regional biodiversity conservation action plans should include multiple habitats. Moreover, the significant seasonal species turnover proved the need for seasonal sampling to assess accurately the total diversity of chironomids in the system.

AMEGHINIANA												RECENT OSTRACODES FROM THE PAMPAS, BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA: ECOLOGY AND PALEOLIMNOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS. Twenty non-marine ostracod species were collected from the pampas of Buenos Aires Province. Water parameters were analyzed in order to determine what environmental conditions each species prefers and which factor affects their occurrence. Studies suggest that most species prefer waters containing particular salinity and solute types. Marginal estuarine ostracods can only survive in oligo-polihaline Cl-/Na+ dominated waters with dayly fluctuating salinities. Freshwater ostracods living in temporary ponds can only survive in oligohaline HCO3-/Na+ dominated waters. Finally, ostracods inhabiting permanent lakes can live in more than one solute type (Cl-/Na+ or HCO3-/Na+), but these solute type variations must be gradual, related with the balance between evaporation and precipitation. Reproductive modes, trophic level and predation are also taking into account. These conclusions encourage the use of fossil non marine ostracods from the Pampas of Buenos Aires as valuable tools to reconstruct late quaternary paleoclimatic conditions.																			0002-7014	1851-8044				MAR 30	2006	43	1					181	204																WOS:000237330900016

Orbital controls on eastern African hydroclimate in the Pleistocene	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Understanding eastern African paleoclimate is critical for contextualizing early human evolution, adaptation, and dispersal, yet Pleistocene climate of this region and its governing mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the lack of long, orbitally-resolved, terrestrial paleoclimate records. Here we present leaf wax hydrogen isotope records of rainfall from paleolake sediment cores from key time windows that resolve long-term trends, variations, and high-latitude effects on tropical African precipitation. Eastern African rainfall was dominantly controlled by variations in low-latitude summer insolation during most of the early and middle Pleistocene, with little evidence that glacial-interglacial cycles impacted rainfall until the late Pleistocene. We observe the influence of high-latitude-driven climate processes emerging from the last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5) to the present, an interval when glacial-interglacial cycles were strong and insolation forcing was weak. Our results demonstrate a variable response of eastern African rainfall to low-latitude insolation forcing and high-latitude-driven climate change, likely related to the relative strengths of these forcings through time and a threshold in monsoon sensitivity. We observe little difference in mean rainfall between the early, middle, and late Pleistocene, which suggests that orbitally-driven climate variations likely played a more significant role than gradual change in the relationship between early humans and their environment.					; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020; Trauth, Martin/A-6293-2008; Asrat, Asfawossen/KBB-6085-2024; Foerster, Verena/AES-0920-2022; Lupien, Rachel/HJI-2324-2023; Roberts, Helen/I-1041-2012	Lupien, Rachel/0000-0002-5618-8829; Castaneda, Isla/0000-0002-2524-9326; Asrat, Asfawossen/0000-0002-6312-8082; Schaebitz, Frank/0000-0003-3879-9308; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Roberts, Helen/0000-0001-9649-2377													2045-2322					FEB 24	2022	12	1							3170	10.1038/s41598-022-06826-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06826-z								35210479					WOS:000761303400038

Carbon steady-state model of the planktonic food web of Lake Biwa, Japan	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A steady-state model of carbon flows was developed to describe the summer planktonic food web in the surface mixed-layer of the North Basin in Lake Biwa, Japan. This model synthesised results from numerous studies on the plankton of Lake Biwa. 2. An inverse analysis procedure was used to estimate missing flow values in a manner consistent with known information. Network analysis was applied to characterise emergent properties of the resulting food web. 3. The system strongly relied on flows related to detrital particles. Whereas primary production was mainly by phytoplankton > 20 mu m, microzooplankton were active and mainly ingested detritus and bacteria. 4. The main emergent property of the system was strong recycling, through either direct ingestion of non-living material by zooplankton, or ingestion of bacteria after degradation of detritus to release dissolved organic carbon.

The caldera, slightly smaller than the Crater Lake structure in Oregon, is 6 x 7 km in diameter; its inner walls are 500-900 m high, and it has a remarkably Rat Boor at 1400 m below sea level (mbsl), The caldera collapse volume is similar to 18 km(3), suggesting that more than 40 km(3) of pumiceous tephra may have been erupted at the time the caldera formed. Precaldera seafloor eruptions built a broad volcanic edifice consisting of overlapping composite volcanoes made of rhyolitic lavas, shallow intrusions, and a variety of volcaniclastic deposits-including thick accumulations of rhyolitic pumice erupted at 900-500 mbsl, The caldera-forming eruption produced a 150-200 m deposit of nonwelded, fines-depleted pumice that resembles a colossal layer of popcorn at the top of the caldera wall. Freshly erupted pumice behaved as "sinkers" or "floaters," depending on the environment in which it cooled, The pumice clasts deposited proximally and exposed in the caldera wall were likely quenched in eruption columns that remained below sea level. This pumice ingested seawater and sank as gases filling its vesicles cooled, particularly as steam in its vesicles condensed to liquid water. Some eruption columns may have broken through the sea surface and entered the air, especially during vigorous phases of the caldera-forming eruption. These pumices had the opportunity to ingest air as they cooled, becoming Boaters as they fell back to the sea; these could have been carried distally on the sea surface by the combined effects of ocean currents and wind. The age of the caldera is unknown, but it may be as young as several thousand years. Its magmatic system at depth retains sufficient heat to sustain an actively growing intracaldera Kuroko-type polymetallic sulfide deposit, rich in gold and silver and topped by chimneys emitting fluids as hot as 278 OC, Sufficient time has elapsed, however, for a 250-m-high postcaldera dome to grow on the caldera floor and for the caldera rim to be deeply scalloped by slumping.																			0016-7606					JUL	2001	113	7					813	824		10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0813:SSCATF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0813:SSCATF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169670400002
J	SIEGFRIED, CA				SIEGFRIED, CA			THE PELAGIC ROTIFER COMMUNITY OF AN ACIDIC CLEARWATER LAKE IN THE ADIRONDACK MOUNTAINS OF NEW-YORK-STATE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The pelagic rotifer community of Silver Lake, an acidic clearwater Adirondack lake, was studied during the open water seasons of 1988 through 1990. The chemical characteristics of Silver Lake were very similar each year but transparency and stratification characteristics differed significantly. Spring 1989 was marked by much greater rainfall, and thus runoff, than that of 1988 and 1990. This led to greater springtime chlorophyll concentrations, lower transparency, and smaller epilimnion volume in 1989. The greater productivity in 1989 can be linked to significant shifts in crustacean community composition and in rotifer abundance. Keratella taurocephala was very abundant in Silver Lake in 1988 and 1990. Densities in excess of 1000/l were common in the upper hypolimnion. Mean water column abundance peaked in June and July at > 650/l. Although K. taurocepbala dominated the rotifer community again in 1989 its abundance was much lower. Densities were generally less than 50/l, with a maximum of 141/l in October. The crustacean zooplankton community of Silver Lake was dominated by Diaptomus minutus in 1988 and 1990 but by Daphnia catawba in 1989. Evidence from Silver Lake and other Adirondack lakes supports the hypothesis that reduced exploitative competition from cladocera in acid lakes leads to enhanced food resources for K. taurocephala and thus extremely high populations.																			0003-9136					OCT	1991	122	4					441	462																WOS:A1991GQ31100004
J	BAKER, PD; HUMPAGE, AR				BAKER, PD; HUMPAGE, AR			TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH COMMONLY OCCURRING CYANOBACTERIA IN SURFACE WATERS OF THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN, AUSTRALIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Surveys of cyanobacterial blooms were made over four consecutive summer seasons (1990-93) in surface waters of the Murray-Darling Basin in south-eastern Australia to determine the incidence and geographic distribution of toxicity associated with a range of recognized taxa. In all, 231 field samples and 143 cultured isolates, representing 13 genera, were tested for toxicity by intra-peritoneal mouse bioassay. Toxicity was recorded in 42% of all field samples and was expressed quantitatively on the basis of both dry weight and cell number. Anabaena was the most abundant genus in blooms occurring in riverine and wetland habitats, and Anabaena circinalis was prominent in all field samples that were neurotoxic. Neurotoxicity was not demonstrated in any other species of Anabaena, or in any other genus, in both field and cultured material. Assays for anatoxin-a were negative, and symptoms of neurotoxicity in mice were not consistent with those reported elsewhere for anatoxin-a(s). Hepatotoxic blooms occurred predominantly in standing waters and were invariably caused by Microcystis aeruginosa f. aeruginosa throughout the greater part of the Basin. Toxic blooms of Nodularia spumigena were recorded only in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert at the mouth of the River Murray. Hepatotoxicity was also demonstrated indrospermopsis raciborskii, which was previously recognized in Australia only as a subtropical cyanobacterium.																			0067-1940						1994	45	5					773	786																WOS:A1994PW75600005

Reproduction was monitored by histological examinations of gonads and by morphometric changes in oocyte nuclei from February 1998 to January 1999. Gonadal development commenced overwinter. Gamete deposition started in spring when the water temperature reached 13 degreesC. By May, the reproductive season had commenced but while in Lake Come it finished in August, in the Adda River depositions were observed until the end of October. The course of the Maturity Index and mainly the oocyte nuclei diameter analysis suggested the possibility of two main reproductive events in the lake zebra mussel population. In contrast, more continuous spawning was observed in the river mussels. In both sites, frequency distributions of nucleus size showed maturation of at least two gamete cohorts which supported successive depositions. The gonadal resting stage was longer in males than females. Oogenesis started soon after the end of the reproductive period while spermatogenesis commenced only 3 or 4 months later. This is the first study dealing with the Dreissena polymorpha reproductive cycle in the South Alps. Results are discussed and compared with regard to other populations living in the rest of Europe and North America.

J	Brooks, SJ; Birks, HJB				Brooks, SJ; Birks, HJB			Chironomid-inferred late-glacial air temperatures at Whitrig Bog, southeast Scotland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												This paper presents the first chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature reconstruction for the Late-glacial in Britain. The reconstruction suggests that the thermal maximum occurred early in the interstadial, with temperatures reaching about 12 degreesC. There was then a gradual downward trend to about 11 degreesC, punctuated by four distinct cold oscillations of varying intensity. At the beginning of the Younger Dryas, mean July temperatures fell to about 7.5 degreesC but gradually increased to about 9 degreesC before a rapid rise at the onset of the Holocene. The chironomid-inferred temperature curve agrees closely, both in general trends and in detail, with the GRIP ice-core oxygen-isotope curve. The reconstructed temperatures are 2-4 degreesC lower than coleopteran-inferred temperatures but are closer to those inferred from plant macrofossils and glacial equilibrium-line altitudes during the Younger Dryas.

Impact of glacier shrinkage and adapted hydropower potential in the Swiss Alps	HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU												Global warming is an alarming reality and likely leads to an increase of multiple pressures on socio-economic systems. However, in high-mountain regions it might also become an opportunity to adapt existing hydropower schemes and to develop new projects to this reality. In the Alps, the melting of glaciers first produces over the near future an increase of the average annual discharge depending on glacier and catchment characteristics, especially during the summer season. Nevertheless after a certain time, significant decrease of runoff related to glacier melting must be considered for hydropower management. Moreover, the shrinking glaciers free new areas, having the potential for the construction of new dams and reservoirs. The opportunity to build new dams and hydropower plants downstream of retreating glaciers is studied using two Models. The first (GlabTop) is used to predict the future topography and geomorphology underneath the melting glaciers, in order to define the optimal locations of the future dams and reservoirs. Secondly, the RS3.0 CLIMATE rainfall-runoff hydrological model computes the glacier evolution, the river discharge at the outlet of the catchment area as well as the hydropower production of the new schemes. As a case study the Upper Aare River basin in Switzerland is presented. The opportunity of the construction of a new dam and a hydropower plant is studied, including its economic benefit. The result of the case study provides a basis to assess the potential of investing in such projects to ensure the Swiss hydroelectricity production also in future as well as peak energy for the European grid.

Dynamic diatom response to changing climate 0-1.2 Ma at Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russian Arctic	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The Lake El' gygytgyn sediment record contains an abundant diatom flora through most intervals of the lake's history, providing a means to create and test hypotheses concerning the lake's response to changing climates. The 0 1.2 Ma core interval is characterized by shifts in the dominant planktonic genera and events of exceptional concentration and diversity. Warm interglacial intervals have enhanced concentration and diversity of the plankton. This response is most extreme during exceptional events corresponding to marine isotope stages (MIS) 11 and 31. Diatom concentration and diversity also increase during some cold intervals (e.g., MIS 2), suggesting conditions of lake circulation and nutrient cycling promoting diatom production during these events. Short intervals of low plankton concentration accompanied by shifts in the dominant genus of the lake suggest conditions during certain cold events generate a severe impact on plankton production. The absence of these events during extended intervals of low summer insolation variability suggests a muted cold-event response of the lake system linked to regional climate.					; Cherepanova, Marina/AAT-1683-2021	Cherepanova, Marina/0000-0002-6530-0093; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2013	9	3					1309	1319		10.5194/cp-9-1309-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-1309-2013													WOS:000322859700020

W.; Marsh, Philip			Lengthening plus shortening of river-to-lake connection times in the Mackenzie River Delta respectively via two global change mechanisms along the arctic coast	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												River deltas along the circumpolar arctic coast are lake-rich and poorly understood ecosystems, set in a region expected to change rapidly. Over the past 30+ years annual river-to-lake connection times in the Mackenzie Delta have lengthened (>30 days) in the lowest elevation lakes and may have shortened in the highest elevation lakes, respectively via sea level rise and declining effects of river-ice breakup. Lengthened connection times indicate summer low-water levels in the delta have increased by an amount (0.3 m) equivalent to three times local sea level rise (0.1 m) over the same period. Such an amplification effect of recent sea level rise has been completely unexpected and may be a result of enhanced storm surges in response to receding arctic sea ice or coastal backwater effects on the river flow. Shortened connection times are consistent with other work showing a decline in river-ice breakup effects, an important control on annual peak water levels.																			0094-8276					DEC 12	2007	34	23							L23404	10.1029/2007GL031656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL031656													WOS:000251690000004

Gypsum dissolution drives the precipitation of calcite, thus consuming carbonate ions released by dolomite. Lake Banyoles, in northeastern Spain, is a karst lake supplied by sublacustrine springs, and karstic collapse is occurring in the immediate vicinity of the lake. Lake water is dominated by Mg-Ca and SO4-HCO3, and is supersaturated with calcite that is actively accumulating in lake sediments. Water chemistry, sulfur isotope composition, local stratigrapy, and mass-balance modeling suggest that the primary karst-forming process at Lake Banyoles is dedolomitization of basement rocks driven by gypsum dissolution. Karstification takes place along the subsurface contact between the gypsiferous Beuda Formation and the dolomitic Perafita Formation. This process is here recognized for the first time to cause karstification on a large scale; this is significant because it proceeds without the addition of soil-generated carbonic acid. Gypsum-driven dedolomitization may be responsible for other karstic systems heretofore attributed to soil-generated carbonic acid.																			0091-7613					NOV	1994	22	11					995	998		10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0995:KWCABD>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0995:KWCABD>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PP79000009

Nodularia spumigena (Mertens in Juergens) was recorded in the lake in the summer months of 2005. Maximum filament concentration of the species (1.3 x 10(5) fil L-1) was measured in August and constituted 60% of total cyanobacteria abundance. Trichomes were solitary, straight and had cells containing gas vesicles. Heterocysts were regularly spaced throughout the filaments. In the isolated filaments nodularin was detected by HPLC, ELISA and PPIA as well as LC-MS. HPLC analysis showed that gravimetric nodularin concentration in cultured N. spumigena cells was 578 p,g of nodularin per gram dry weight (d.w.). Apart from nodularin, demethylated nodularin variant was also found in Nodularia cell extract. This is the first report of toxic N. spumigena in a European freshwater lake. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	SPENCE, JR				SPENCE, JR			EXPERIMENTAL-ANALYSIS OF MICROHABITAT SELECTION IN WATER-STRIDERS (HETEROPTERA, GERRIDAE)	ECOLOGY												Associations between water-strider species and particular types of vegetation structure result proximately from habitat fidelity at the time of spring colonization and from different preferences for habitats within lakes. Individual gerrids discriminate among lakes during prereproductive dispersal on a trial-and-error basis. Gerrid species differ with respect to preference for emergent cover. Wind and surface disturbance increase preference for sheltered habitats in all species studied but extent of response varies among species. Gerris pingreensis and G. comatus actively seek out emergent cover and open habitats, respectively. G. buenoi is a habitat generalist but distribution of this species is affected by a tendency to avoid other species. Habitat associations of these 3 common Gerris spp. are explained in terms of habitat preferences and species interactions. Foraging efficiency varies with habitat structure and species morphology; thus surface habitats provide a variable selective background for the evolution of gerrid species.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1981	62	6					1505	1514		10.2307/1941507	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941507													WOS:A1981MT21800011
J	XIE, CY; YING, CC				XIE, CY; YING, CC			ADAPTEDNESS OF NOBLE FIR (ABIES-PROCERA REHD) BEYOND ITS NORTHERN LIMIT	FOREST SCIENCE												The adaptedness of noble fir (Abies procera Rehd.) beyond its northern limit was examined at 12 locations distributed throughout the Maritime, Submaritime, and Subcontinental climates in south coastal British Columbia. Ten-year testing results demonstrated large site effects. Noble fir planted in the Maritime climate survived better, grew faster, entered the period of accelerated growth earlier, and maintained a higher growth rate. In the Maritime climate, the reforestation range of noble fir can be extended considerably north of its current natural distribution and to lower elevations. Low winter temperature and growing-season soil moisture appear to be the major environmental factors limiting the species' expansion into more continental climates, and these factors must be considered in planting site selection. Provenance differences in both growth and survival were significant but small compared to site differences. Adaptive variation showed gentle geographic clines indicating that northern provenances were better adapted in the Maritime climate, whereas inland provenances were superior in the Submaritime climate. Lack of strong geographic patterns suggests that local environmental factors may be important to the adaptive variation of the species. The test results suggest that introduction of noble fir to British Columbia should be limited to the Maritime region, and that northern provenances, such as French Butte, McKinley Lake, and Stevens Pass in Washington are the primary seed sources.																			0015-749X					AUG	1994	40	3					412	428																WOS:A1994PC65900003

However, the long-term history of these lakes and the driving mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we reconstructed the history of the paleolakes within the Hetao Basin over the past similar to 1.68 Myr, based on delta O-18 and delta C-13 records from lacustrine authigenic carbonates in a 274.60-m-long drill core from the centre of the Hetao Basin. The absence of covariation of carbonate delta O-18 and delta C-13 during the intervals of similar to 1.47-1.30 Ma and similar to 1.17-1.07 Ma suggests the existence of a hydrologically-open lake system in the Hetao Basin. The relatively low and invariant carbonate delta O-18 values are similar to those of the modern Yellow River water, suggesting that the paleolakes formed when the lakes and the Yellow River were connected. The moderately high correlation (r = 0.61) of carbonate delta O-18 and delta C-13 during similar to 0.68-0.60 Ma suggests an intermittently open hydrology of the lake probably with a tendency towards closure within certain intervals. The low correlation during 0.47-0.28 Ma suggests a hydrologically open lake, while the relatively high delta O-18 values suggest a longer residence time of the lake water. The high correlation (r = 0.92) of carbonate delta O-18 and delta C-13 from similar to 0.28 Ma to the last interglacial suggests a hydrologically-closed lake, although the Yellow River may have flowed through the Hetao Basin at that time. The interaction of the tectonically-controlled relative height of the basin spill point and the climatically-driven sediment and water supply of the Yellow River was responsible for the long-term evolution of the paleolake within the Hetao Basin. Strong regional tectonic activity which induced the uplift of the eastern part of the Hetao Basin and Jinshan Gorge and raised the relative height of the spill point was the primary cause of the formation of a hydrologically-closed lake within the basin.					; Zaijun, Li/JVD-8191-2023	Li, Baofeng/0000-0002-7170-5804; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				DEC 20	2020	557								119798	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119798													WOS:000589921700008

Morphological variation between non-native lake- and stream-dwelling pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosusin the Iberian Peninsula	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The objective of this study was to test if morphological differences in pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus found in their native range (eastern North America) that are linked to feeding regime, competition with other species, hydrodynamic forces and habitat were also found among stream- and lake- or reservoir-dwelling fish in Iberian systems. The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

This proposed new species can be differentiated from similar species by recognizable characters or character combinations: valve outline and symmetry, shape of the apices and of the central area, striation density, size, anchor-shaped terminal raphe endings (SEM feature), ecology. Brachysira chiaruccii sp. nov. is so far known to colonize oligotrophic, circumneutral, sufficiently buffered, moderately low conductivity mountain lakes, whilst the typical habitat of the most similar (North American) heteropolar Brachysira species (B. ocalanensis) is dystrophic, very low alkalinity and pH environments. The description is based on SEM and LM micrographs which document the full spectrum of shape variability along the size diminution series (including girdle views), plastid arrangement and morphology, and ecological preferences, in particular along the pH-alkalinity gradient.

Three physiological groups could be distinguished: (a) microaerobic ciliates which tracked the oxic-anoxic boundary within the stratified water column; (b) anaerobic ciliates with endosymbiotic methanogens; and (c) anaerobes without endosymbiotic methanogens. Both groups of anaerobes were confined to the anoxic zone of the hypolimnion. Community biomass was dominated by microaerobic ciliates which had on average 20 times larger cells than anaerobic ciliates. Abundance and biomass of microaerobic ciliates decreased over the summer, while anaerobic ciliates increased. This reflected a spatial shift in the availability of inorganic nutrients and, as a result, of ciliate food from the epi- and metalimnion to the hypolimnion. The low biomass production of anaerobic ciliates was consistent with the low theoretical growth efficiency of anaerobic metabolism. Ciliate species displayed characteristic spatial and seasonal distribution patterns within the water column which were similar in both years investigated. Spatial and temporal distribution was mainly governed by two factors: (1) the distribution of dissolved oxygen; and (2) the availability of food. Distribution patterns were not related to chemical gradients other than the oxygen gradient, but they were correlated with the distribution of major food sources.																			0168-6496					SEP	1994	14	4					293	305		10.1016/0168-6496(94)90113-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-6496(94)90113-9													WOS:A1994PH57600003

Assessment of temporal and spatial eutrophication index in a water dam reservoir	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												Eutrophication is considered as a serious problem in water reservoirs. Awareness about the eutrophic status of each reservoir could help in providing a better understanding of the problem in a global scale. The present study was conducted to assess temporal and spatial eutrophication index in a water reservoir (Sahand dam) in the northwest of Iran. Physico-chemical parametres that are effective on eutrphic condition occurrence were analyzed, and trophic state index was calculated on a scale of 0-100 by measuring Secchi disk depth, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total suspended solids, and phosphorus P/N ratio. Moreover, using the overlapping, the reservoir was mapped based on the mentioned index. Seasonal variation of dissolved solids in the reservoir was recorded due to precipitation and subsequent dilution and evaporation. Thermal stratification was observed during the summer months. The total trophic state index value was calculated as 55.5-58.07, with minimum value belonging to P/N and maximum value belonging to suspended solids for individual parameters. There were some spatial and temporal differences for trophic state index in the reservoir. It was found that the whole area of the reservoir was in almost moderately upper-mesotrophic condition and in some target stations it was very close to eutrophic condition. The worst condition was observed in Qaranqu River as the main input to the reservoir. Due to the significant impact of suspended particles resulting from erosion of the surrounding lands on TSI value, there is an urgent need for mitigation measures to intercept eutrophication.

J	Nagano, M; Doi, H				Nagano, Mariko; Doi, Hideyuki			Degree of high phenotypic plasticity in wild populations of Daphnia in early spring	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Inducible defenses have been empirically known as defensive phenotypes that are triggered by predator kairomones. We hypothesized that morphological defense of wild Daphnia varies not only with predator density. but also with the predator regime in the field. We observed how the morphological defenses of two Daphnia species (D. ambigua and a pules) changed according to the population density in the water column at daytime of predatory insect larvae ChaoborusJim:jeans in Lake Fukami-ike, Japan, from February to July. In both Daphnia species, the inducible defense morphology was highly expressed in March and April. Its degree of expression decreased. and did not change with increases in predator density from May to July. These seasons are generally considered as when the number of the larvae and fish increases. and predation becomes more active due to their growth and breeding. We suggest that the degree of inducible defense of Daphnia is higher at the end of the overwintering season. when Chaoborus larvae began to inhabit the water column during the daytime and is constant in other seasons regardless of predators' regime changes. Field observation of wild populations is important for understanding the seasonal changes in the morphology and to provide more realistic explanations of phenomena in inducible defense.

Incipient faulting near Lake Pillsbury, California, and the role of accessory faults in plate boundary evolution	GEOLOGY												We compare the spatiotemporal progression, geometry, and earthquake source characteristics of a zone of anomalous swarm seismicity between the Maacama and Bartlett Springs faults (California, United States) within the northern San Andreas fault system to both laboratory studies of fracture initiation and structural field observations of fault formation. The similarities between laboratory and field studies of incipient faulting and the earthquake swarms suggest that the seismic lineament on which the swarms occur is a fault in an early stage of development. Kinematic descriptions of faulting and models of fault system development suggest that the ability of existing faults to accommodate deformation across plate boundaries is governed by the length scales over which they accommodate stress. Many of the characteristics of juvenile fault zones, such as segmentation, geometric complexity, and the depth extent of faulting, act to reduce this length scale; this requires the reactivation of existing faults or production of accessory faults to accommodate deformation across the plate boundary.

Estimating sources of elemental and organic carbon and their temporal emission patterns using a least squares inverse model and hourly measurements from the St. Louis-Midwest supersite	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Emission inventories of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) contain large uncertainties both in their spatial and temporal distributions for different source types. An inverse model was used to evaluate EC and OC emissions based on 1 year of hourly measurements from the St. Louis-Midwest supersite. The input to the model consisted of continuous measurements of EC and OC obtained for 2002 using two semicontinuous analyzers. High resolution meteorological simulations were performed for the entire time period using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). These were used to simulate hourly back trajectories at the measurement site using a Lagrangian model (FLEXPART-WRF). In combination, an Eulerian model (CAMx: The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) was used to simulate the impacts at the measurement site using known emissions inventories for point and area sources from the Lake Michigan Directors Consortium (LADCO) as well as for open burning from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN). By considering only passive transport of pollutants, the Bayesian inversion simplifies to a single least squares inversion. The inverse model combines forward Eulerian simulations with backward Lagrangian simulations to yield estimates of emissions from sources in current inventories as well as from emissions that might be missing in the inventories. The CAMx impacts were disaggregated into separate time chunks in order to determine improved diurnal, weekday and monthly temporal patterns of emissions. Because EC is a primary species, the inverse model estimates can be interpreted directly as emissions. In contrast, OC is both a primary and a secondary species. As the inverse model does not differentiate between direct emissions and formation in the plume of those direct emissions, the estimates need to be interpreted as contributions to measured concentrations. Emissions of EC and OC in the St. Louis region from on-road, non-road, marine/aircraft/railroad (MAR), "other" and point sources were revised slightly downwards on average. In particular, both MAR and point sources had a more pronounced diurnal variation than in the inventory. The winter peak in "other" emissions was not corroborated by the inverse model. On-road emissions have a larger difference between weekday and weekends in the inverse estimates than in the inventory, and appear to be poorly simulated or characterized in the winter months. The model suggests that open burning emissions are significantly underestimated in the inventory. Finally, contributions of unknown sources seems to be from areas to the south of St. Louis and from afternoon and nighttime emissions.					de Foy, Benjamin/I-8050-2019; de Foy, Benjamin/A-9902-2010; Wiedinmyer, Christine/E-2049-2013	de Foy, Benjamin/0000-0003-4150-9922; Wiedinmyer, Christine/0000-0001-9738-6592; Schauer, James/0000-0002-5405-1511; 													1680-7316	1680-7324					2015	15	5					2405	2427		10.5194/acp-15-2405-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-2405-2015													WOS:000350559700010

Tephrochronological evidence for the late Holocene eruption history of El Chichon Volcano, Mexico	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL					Conference on El Chichon Eruptions, Explosive Volcanism, Volcanic Hazard and Related Subjects	MAR 20-22, 2007	San Cristobal Casas, MEXICO	Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Univ Ciencias & Artes Chiapas, Int Assoc Volcanol & Chem Earths Interior				Pre-Columbian societies in the Maya Lowlands were repeatedly exposed to tephra-fall from past eruptions of El Chichon volcano, Chiapas, Mexico. Late Holocene tephra layers are well preserved in sediments of the Usumacinta-Grijalva river delta, about 150 km NNE of the volcano. A sediment core from the delta spans the last 2100 years, and was examined for tephra, pollen, palynomorphs and macrofossils. We used tephrochronology and palynology to reconstruct the timing, magnitude and impact of past eruptions. Seven of the ten recognised tephra layers are related to past eruptions of El Chichon volcano and show remarkable impacts of the eruptions. A large eruption around A. D. 539 had a dramatic effect on the core area of Maya civilisation and was probably responsible for the onset of the Maya Hiatus and a demographic shift towards the Usumacinta-Grijalva delta. The eruption also seems to have caused rapid environmental changes worldwide.					; Martin-Del-Pozzo, Ana Lillian/GRF-1505-2022	Hoek, Wim/0000-0001-7313-100X; Martin-Del-Pozzo, Ana Lillian/0000-0003-4364-3762; 													0016-7169					JAN-MAR	2009	48	1					97	112																WOS:000263907200008

Here, we present the reconstruction of the lake-level fluctuations of Lake El'gygytgyn since Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 based on lithological and palynological as well as chronological studies of shallow-water sediment cores and subaerial lake terraces. Reconstructed lake levels show an abrupt rise during glacial-interglacial terminations (MIS 6/5 and MIS 2/1) and during the MIS 4/3 stadial-interstadial transition. The most prominent lowstands occurred during glacial periods associated with a permanent lake-ice cover (namely MIS 6, MIS 4 and MIS 2). Major triggering mechanisms of the lake-level fluctuations at Lake El'gygytgyn are predominantly changes in air temperature and precipitation. Regional summer temperatures control the volume of meltwater supply as well as the duration of the lake-ice cover (permanent or seasonal). The duration of the lake-ice cover, in turn, enables or hampers near-shore sediment transport, thus leading to long-term lake-level oscillations on glacial-interglacial time scales by blocking or opening the lake outflow, respectively. During periods of seasonal ice cover the lake level was additionally influenced by changes in precipitation. The discovered mechanism of climatologically driven level fluctuations of Lake El'gygytgyn are probably valid for large hydrologically open lakes in the Arctic in general, thus helping to understand arctic palaeohydrology and providing missing information for climate modelling.

The identification of a suitable Antarctic site requires sufficient knowledge of the subglacial landscape beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we present new ice thickness information from the Dome Fuji region, East Antarctica, based on airborne radar surveys conducted during the 2014/15 and 2016/17 southern summers. Compared to previous maps of the region, the new dataset shows a more complex landscape with networks of valleys and mountain plateaus. We use the new dataset as input in a thermokinematic model that incorporates uncertainties in geothermal heat flux values in order to improve the predictions of potential ice-core sites. Our results show that especially the region immediately south of Dome Fuji station persists as a good candidate site for obtaining an old ice core. An initial assessment of basal conditions revealed the existence of what appears to be subglacial lakes. Further radar data analysis shows overall high continuity of layer stratigraphy in the region. This indicates that extending the age-depth information from the Dome Fuji ice core to a new ice-core drill site is a viable option.

In this study, we investigated ecosystem respiration and its components in a Poyang lake Carex meadow during the drawdown periods from May 2009 to June 2011. Both ecosystem respiration and its components showed clear temporal variation pattern, with temperature being the dominant control. Ecosystem respiration ranged from 98.01 to 1359.25 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1). Shoot and root respiration contributed approximately 36% and 26% to the ecosystem respiration, respectively, whereas microbial respiration accounted for 38% of the ecosystem respiration. The ratio of total soil respiration to ecosystem respiration varied from 0.45 to 0.90, depending on growing season stages. Their Q(10) values ranged from 1.72 to 2.51, with the maximum for shoot respiration and the minimum for microbial respiration. In addition, the Q(10) values varied with time and among ecosystem respiratory components and hence could not be treated as a constant. None of the respiration measurements was significantly related to soil moisture, suggesting that soil moisture was not a limiting environmental factor for respiratory activity during the drawdown periods in this meadow. The Carex meadow acted as strong carbon sink during the drawdown periods due to double growing seasons, but the previous summer flood duration could substantially alter carbon sink intensity in the following drawdown period. The total carbon sink of the littoral zone of Poyang Lake during drawdown periods was estimated to be 0.17-0.59 Tg C yr(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, infections with the halophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus have been increasingly described in people with pre-existing illnesses after contact with water, particularly in the hot summer months in Germany. Although autochthonous infections are still relatively rare in Germany overall, increasing numbers of infections are to be expected in the coming years due to advancing climate change. Due to the high mortality rate, doctors should be familiar with the clinical picture of this "emerging infection" and be able to initiate appropriate therapy as quickly as possible.																			0012-0472	1439-4413				OCT	2024	149	21					1302	1304		10.1055/a-2383-6492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-2383-6492													WOS:001337039400010

Content analysis of responses regarding the types of impact the ROV had on their perception and experience with the natural environment revealed various positive perceptions. Positive impacts expressed included increased accessibility to marine environments, opportunities for experiential education, and ease of using the ROV. Although less frequently noted, negative impacts were also expressed, primarily focusing on the potential for environmental disturbance. However, the disturbances noted were relative to the boat in which the ROV was used rather than the ROV itself.																									2006		P-14					518	+																WOS:000250664700067

Since climate controls tree-ring formation, it is expected that air-water-land interaction at Lake Baikal region (southern Siberia), the world's largest freshwater reservoir, could potentially impact tree growth in the surrounding areas. Therefore, we aimed to determine if Lake Baikal influences Pinus sylvestris L. tree-ring growth by modifying climate conditions and alleviating climate limiting factors of tree growth in its neighboring areas. Here we combine dendrochronological measurements with tree growth modeling to evaluate the variability in the climate response of Scots pine annual (tree-ring width) and intra-annual (earlywood and latewood widths) growth and phenology at four sites (two inland and two coastal sites) in the Baikal region for the 1960-2016 period. Tree growth was significantly higher, with longer growing seasons, at the inland sites than at coastal sites. However, an increasingly negative effect of summer temperature and a positive effect of relative humidity on tree-ring growth were observed with increasing distance to the lake. The results suggest that although Lake Baikal's thermal mass lessens the climate control on the tree growth by acting as a thermal and hydric buffer in the downwind coastal sites, other factors than climate might potentially control tree growth in the region. Our results also suggest that the high plasticity of P. sylvestris to thrive in different environmental conditions will probably allow a better adaptation to the projected warmer regional climate than non-drought tolerant species inhabiting the same region.

Temporal and spatial characteristics of potential energy anomaly in Lake Taihu	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this study, water temperature and meteorological data in Lake Taihu from June 11 to July 6, 2013, are collected to calibrate and verify the unstructured grid finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) coupled with a heat exchange module. The spatial and temporal variations of potential energy anomalies (PEA) in the lake, simulated by the calibrated FVCOM, are analyzed to explore the stratification and de-stratification processes in water body. The temporal variation of PEA primarily follows the diurnal cycles of solar radiation, while the spatial heterogeneity of PEA is jointly determined by solar radiation and vertical shear of horizontal velocity coupled with the topography of the lake. The maxima of PEA in the lake are not greater than 4 J/m(3) in the summer and even smaller along shore regions and near the Pingtaishan station. This study is helpful to improve understanding of the effect of physical processes on the algae bloom in Lake Taihu.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2018	25	24					24316	24325		10.1007/s11356-018-2204-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2204-y								29948715					WOS:000441784000075

Factors that determine the survival of freshwater cyanobacteria in brackish waters have not been well investigated. Here, we studied the spatiotemporal variability of inorganic nitrogen in an upstream lake and conducted laboratory and in-situ experiments to assess the role of nitrogen availability on the salt tolerance of Microcystis and the release of microcystins. A series of field experiments were carried out during bloom seasons to evaluate the salt tolerance of natural Microcystis colonies. The salt tolerance threshold varied from 7 to 17 and showed a positive relationship with intracellular carbohydrate content and a negative relationship with nitrogen availability in water. In August when upstream nitrogen availability was lower, the Microcystis colonies could maintain their biomass even after a sudden increase in salinity from 4 to 10. Laboratory-cultivated Microcystis that accumulated higher carbohydrate content at lower nitrogen availability showed better cell survival at higher salinity. The sharp release of microcystins into the surrounding water occurred when salinity exceeded the salt tolerance threshold of the Microcystis. Thus, Microcystis with higher salt tolerance can accumulate more toxins in cells. The obtained results suggest that the cell survival and toxin concentration in brackish waters depend on the physiological properties of Microcystis formed in the upstream waters. Thus, the life history of Microcystis in upstream waters could have a significant impact on its salt tolerance in downstream brackish waters, where the ecological risk of the salt-tolerant Microcystis requires special and careful management in summer at low nitrogen availability.					; Wu, Haipeng/AAO-8701-2020; Ostrovsky, Ilia/M-4831-2017; huang, ying/JMR-4268-2023; li, xinlu/HLX-5595-2023; Chen, Xuechu/D-5598-2013	Li, Lei/0009-0000-8123-9723; Ostrovsky, Ilia/0000-0002-0247-7844; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAR 15	2024	252								121213	10.1016/j.watres.2024.121213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121213		FEB 2024						38306752					WOS:001178908800001

Preferred white balance for applications using virtual backgrounds	COLOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATION												Under the current COVID-19 global pandemic, most of the world is operating online, which has increased the importance of better understanding the perceived color quality of video conference calls. We performed two experiments to evaluate the white balance appearance preference for images simulating a scene from a video conference call where a person is using a virtual background. Due to the dissimilarities of the light sources used for the subject and the background scene, the overall picture may look aesthetically unappealing. The first experiment was designed to assess the preference of white balance for images containing a foreground subject, with three different skin tones: light, medium, and dark, and a background scene, with five different color temperature appearances, cool to warm. The background scenes include famous attractions in the United States, water bodies, foliage, and a few less common scenes like a sculpture at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and a ColorChecker. Observers were presented with a pair of images of the same subject with same background scene, but with different white balance appearance. These comparisons were performed for each foreground subject with all background scenes. Both experiments were performed by naive observers, who were from around the globe with no knowledge of color science and observers from the Munsell Color Science Lab (MCSL) at the RIT. The results show that observers' preference increases as we go from cooler to warmer appearance for the Canyon, RIT, Snow, Flower, and Autumn backgrounds, and vice versa for the Lake background. The Golden Gate background results are the most scattered among all scenes with very small differences in their scale values. MCSL observers show a strong agreement in preference to warmer appearance for light and dark skin tones for the RIT scene, and neutral and warmer appearance for medium skin tone for the RIT and Golden Gate scenes, respectively. To understand the relation between the background scene and foreground subject's white balance appearance, a second experiment was performed. The subjects had three different appearances: cool, neutral, and warm. Based on the results of the first experiment, five scenes with two white balance appearances, the most preferred rendition and the neutral rendition (original appearance at the time of the scene was captured), were used for the second paired comparison study. The results indicated that preference varied based on the foreground subject skin tone and background scene. However, the background preferences follow similar trends to the first experiment. There were variations in the degree of agreement, some showed very strong agreement, like dark skin tone with the RIT background, whereas for others, like autumn background with light skin tone, preferences were more scattered. Overall, the differences in the scale values were smaller as compared to the first experiment, which indicates that, as we present the observers with more options, the decision became harder.

A previous two-dimensional hydraulic model failed to explain many observations; therefore, a three-dimensional hydraulic model was constructed using the software application MODFLOW. Isotopic and hydrogeochemical investigations were carried out during the period 1998 to 2002 in order to provide model data. Four water sources have been identified, having different isotopic (and chemical) characteristics. Danube water is characterized by seasonally varying 00 values: its unweighted mean 6180 value is -10.9% for the years 1998 to 2002. The most negative delta(18)O values occur in late spring and summertime. Average tritium content is 20 TU. Infiltrated precipitation has delta(18)O values between -9.0 and -9.5%. The average tritium content of the precipitation is 10 TU, and that of infiltrated precipitation must be close to this value and about half that of the Danube. The delta(18)O value of lake water is > - 9.0%, Its stable isotope composition plots on the right side of the local meteoric water line on the delta D-delta(18)O diagram. Ascending deep groundwater (sampled depth of 20-140 m) has delta(18)O values between -12.0 and -13-5%. Its radiocarbon age is between 16000 and 30000 years BP, probably infiltrated during and around the last glacial maximum (Wurm III) period of the latest glaciation.

J	Stapanian, MA; Witzel, LD; Cook, A				Stapanian, Martin A.; Witzel, Larry D.; Cook, Andy			Temporal Changes and Sexual Differences in Spatial Distribution of Burbot in Lake Erie	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We used GIS mapping techniques to examine capture data for Burbot Lota lota from annual gill-net surveys in Canadian waters of Lake Erie during late August and September 1994-2011. Adult males were captured over a larger area (3-17% for 20% maximum yearly catch [MYC]) than adult females. More males than females were caught in the gill nets in 14 of the 15 study years. Collectively, these results support a hypothesis of greater activity by adult males during summer, when Burbot are actively feeding. The area of capture contracted by more than 60% (for 20% MYC) for both sexes during the time period, which is consistent with the documented decrease of the Burbot population in the lake. The sex ratio (females: males) varied over the time series but declined steadily from 0.97 in 2001 to 0.59 in 2011. The overlap in the capture areas of adult males and females was scale dependent. The depth distribution at which adult Burbot were caught did not change over the time series, and there was no difference in the median depths (about 30m) at which adult male and female Burbot were caught. The last results are consistent with the Burbot's reliance on coldwater habitats. Additional research is recommended, including telemetry to describe daily and seasonal movements and assessment of gender bias in active and passive capture gear.

Results indicated that MCLR was completely biodegraded by Day 7 without nutrient addition. MCLR-biodegradation was inhibited in the presence of phosphate or glucose addition, with complete MCLR removal observed by Day 10. MCLR was totally biodegraded by Day 7 with dual nutrients comprising glucose and nitrate, suggesting that additional nitrate alleviated the inhibitory effect of glucose alone on the biodegradation. Simultaneously, MCLR-degrading gene (mlrA) abundance were detected to increase with increasing amount of MCLR being degraded under the respective conditions, implying that MCLR-biodegradation depended on the population of indigenous MCLR-degrading bacteria (MCLRDB), which was related to the population of non-degrading bacteria in the biofilm. MCLRDB was found to primarily use MCLR for proliferation rather than other nutrients. This is the first report verifying MCLR as a primary substrate for bacteria under various nutrient conditions.

However, we still lack an understanding of how high their diversity is and how these communities are distributed during the long-term ice-cover period. Here, we assessed for the first time the composition and distribution of microbial communities during the ice-cover period in two subarctic lakes (Labynkyr and Vorota) located in the area of the lowest temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. The diversity distribution and abundance of main bacterial taxa as well as the composition of microalgae varied by time and habitat. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing method revealed, in general, a high diversity of bacterial communities where Proteobacteria (similar to 45%) and Actinobacteria (similar to 21%) prevailed. There were significant differences between the communities of the lakes: Chthoniobacteraceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pirellulaceae were abundant in Lake Labynkyr, while Cyanobiaceae, Oligoflexales, Ilumatobacteraceae, and Methylacidiphilaceae were more abundant in Lake Vorota. The most abundant families were evenly distributed in April, May, and June their contribution was different in different habitats. In April, Moraxellaceae and Ilumatobacteraceae were the most abundant in the water column, while Sphingomonadaceae was abundant both in water column and on the ice bottom. In May, the abundance of Comamonadaceae increased and reached the maximum in June, while Cyanobiaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, and Pirellulaceae followed. We found a correlation of the structure of bacterial communities with snow thickness, pH, N-min concentration, and conductivity. We isolated psychrophilic heterotrophic bacteria both from dominating and minor taxa of the communities studied. This allowed for specifying their ecological function in the under-ice communities. These findings will advance our knowledge of the under-ice microbial life.					; Marchenkov, Artyom/J-4652-2018; Galachyants, Yuri/J-4633-2018; Bashenkhaeva, Maria/J-4640-2018; Likhoshway, Yelena/J-4496-2018; Tomberg, Irina/K-6819-2018; Petrova, Darya/J-7615-2016	Petrova, Darya/0000-0002-5594-504X; Marchenkov, Artyom/0000-0002-4820-9394; Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0002-2432-9260; Kopyrina, Liubov Innokentievna/0000-0002-0374-3323													0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2022	84	4					958	973		10.1007/s00248-021-01912-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01912-7		NOV 2021						34741646					WOS:000714999300001

In 2005, we observed a spring bloom of E. pascheri with Lepocinclis ovum as a subdominant species in a shallow oxbow lake located within the Niepolomice Forest of southern Poland. Rapid increases in the populations of both species were accompanied with low pH values, oxygen deficits, and high concentrations of nitrogen compounds, chlorides, Fe. Mn, Zn, and Cd, but with low concentrations of easily assimilated orthophosphates. Water properties within the habitat were extremely different during and after the bloom. E. pascheri and L ovum have not previously been considered as index species of any specific water condition or environmental requirements. However, according to our observations, they are organisms tolerant to water acidification, increased salinity, and the presence of heavy metals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Mainly from studies in Swedish lakes, current velocities and mixing coefficients are quantified for the different processes generating water movement. Seiche movement caused by wind induced oscillations of the ice cover is found to be most efficient for the horizontal mixing giving coefficients of the order 100 cm(2) s(-1). The lateral dispersion in through-flow currents can be determined using standard formulas, but the dispersion coefficient is 1-2 orders of magnitude less than that for oscillation induced mixing. Convective mixing due to heat flow from the sediments lasts through the winter but is a very slow process. Convection caused by penetration of solar radiation is more effective, but this process is usually of importance only during the last month prior to break-up of the ice-cover.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					91	97		10.1007/BF00031811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031811													WOS:A1996UT84700015

O. arctobia and Astragalus alpinus) growing in high tundra at Sarcpa Lake. Melville Peninsula. N.W.T. Nitrogenase activity of intact plants was correlated with the number of nodules per plant, with field soil temperatures and limited by water shortage. Activity in freshly detached nodules showed a plateau of maximum activity between 10.degree. C and 25.degree. C and a near linear decline with temperature down to 0.degree. C. Unusually, the segmented nodules of all three species are perennial in which growth and leghaemoglobin production resumes each spring from an overwintering apical meristem. Nodules are most numerous in the warmer soil stratum (2-10 cm. depth).

In Germany, for example, infections with the halophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus have been increasingly described in recent years in people with pre-existing illnesses after contact with water, particularly in the hot summer months. Although autochthonous infections are still relatively rare in Germany overall, increasing numbers of infections are to be expected in the coming years due to advancing climate change.

Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India	ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY												The diversity of culturable, aerobic and heterotrophic Bacillus and Bacillus-derived genera (BBDG) was investigated in various extreme environments (including thermal springs, cold deserts, mangroves, salt lakes, arid regions, salt pans and acidic soils) of India. Heat treatment followed by enrichment in different media led to a total of 893 bacterial isolates. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using three restriction enzymes AluI, MspI and HaeIII led to the clustering of these isolates into 12-74 groups for the different sites at 75 % similarity index, adding up to 559 groups. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing led to the identification of 392 bacilli, grouped in two families, Bacillaceae (89.03 %) and Paenibacillaceae (10.97 %), and included 13 different genera with 75 distinct species. It was found that among the thirteen genera, nine (Bacillus, Halobacillus, Lysinibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Pontibacillus, Salinibacillus, Sediminibacillus, Thalassobacillus and Virgibacillus) belonged to Bacillaceae and four (Ammoniphilus, Aneurinibacillus, Brevibacillus and Paenibacillus) belonged to Paenibacillaceae. Novel isolates tolerant to low and high pH and temperature, salt and low moisture were identified.

The geologic slip rate on the Fish Lake Valley fault zone (the northwest extension of the Furnace Creek fault zone) increases northward from about 3 to 5 mm/yr, in agreement with modeled geodetic data. The increase coincides with the intersections of the Deep Springs fault, connected to the Owens Valley fault zone, and of other faults connected to the Saline Valley fault, The combined geologic and geodetic data suggest that (1) the northwest-striking faults of the Eastern California shear zone north of the Garlock fault are connected by north- to northeast-striking normal faults that transfer slip in a series of right steps, and (2) the amount and distribution of slip among the many faults of this broad, complex plate boundary have changed through time.																			0091-7613					APR	1996	24	4					339	342		10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0339:KOTECS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024<0339:KOTECS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996UE64600013

Five significant monsoon collapses were identified around 11.5, 11.0, 10.0, 9.4, and 8.2 ka BP as well as three smaller ones around 10.3, 9.0, and 8.6 ka BP. The weak monsoon episodes around 8.6 and 8.2 ka BP form the two-step structure of the 8.2 ka event. All monsoon collapses, coeval with the cooling in northern high-latitude records, are correlated with Lakes Agassiz-Ojibway outbursts. Thus, our data support the idea of freshwater forcing of abrupt climate anomalies during the early Holocene. Nevertheless, the decreased irradiance together with freshwater outburst may account for the 9.2/9.3 ka event, which is expressed more significantly in low-latitude records.					; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Wang, Xuefeng/GXF-6538-2022; Edwards, R./I-3124-2014	Wang, Xuefeng/0000-0002-5759-6920; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; duan, wuhui/0000-0003-3078-040X													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2021	31	11-12					1777	1785	09596836211033218	10.1177/09596836211033218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211033218		JUL 2021											WOS:000676884300001
J	Madof, AS; Bertoni, C; Lofi, J				Madof, Andrew S.; Bertoni, Claudia; Lofi, Johanna			Discovery of vast fluvial deposits provides evidence for drawdown during the late Miocene Messinian salinity crisis	GEOLOGY												The late Miocene Messinian salinity crisis (MSC) was a significant oceanographic event that caused widespread evaporitic accumulation throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Although multiple hypotheses exist regarding the origin of evaporitic and post-evaporitic deposits, researchers remain divided on the magnitude of base-level fall, and on whether these accumulations record deep-water or non-marine conditions. Here, we introduce a previously unknown, upper Messinian fluvial deposit comparable in size to the late Miocene Nile River fluvial valley fill and show that near-complete desiccation of the eastern Mediterranean was responsible for its development. The basin-wide accumulation, which is located offshore Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, lies directly atop deep-basin evaporites and related erosional surfaces, and is one of the largest known riverine deposits associated with the terminal MSC. From marked onshore incision and basinward thinning trends, the source of the accumulation is presumed to be a formerly unidentified drainage basin in southern Turkey and western Syria; the deposit extends >500 km into the western Levant Basin, where its depositional sink is marked by six well-developed backstepping lobes. Based on the deposit's seismic stratigraphy and morphology, which provide clear evidence of subaerial exposure, we question current hypotheses proposing a deep-water origin for late Messinian accumulations. We also draw specific attention to the development of extensive circum-Mediterranean non-marine conditions prior to Zanclean marine transgression, and to the previously overlooked role of fluvial systems in diluting hypersaline lakes in evaporitic basins.

Vulnerability of shallow subarctic lakes to evaporate and desiccate when snowmelt runoff is low	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Snowmelt is a crucial source of water for many shallow subarctic lakes, but climate models predict that snowfall will decrease in some regions, with profound ecological consequences. Here we use lake water isotope data across gradients of terrestrial vegetation cover (open tundra to closed forest) and topographic relief to identify lakes that are vulnerable to desiccation under conditions of low snowmelt runoff in two subarctic landscapesOld Crow Flats, Yukon, and Hudson Bay Lowlands, Manitoba (Canada). Lakes located in low-relief, open tundra catchments in both landscapes displayed a systematic, positive offset between directly measured lake water O-18 over multiple sampling campaigns and lake water O-18 inferred from cellulose in recently deposited surface sediments. We attribute this offset to a strong evaporative O-18-enrichment response to lower-than-average snowmelt runoff in recent years. Notably, some lakes underwent near-complete desiccation during midsummer 2010 following a winter of very low snowfall. Based on the paleolimnological record of one such lake, the extremely dry conditions in 2010 may be unprecedented in the past 200 years. Findings fuel concerns that a decrease in snowmelt runoff will lead to widespread desiccation of shallow lakes in these landscapes.

The ponds were stocked by the seasonal flood with predominantly Oreochromis spp. at densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 fish m(-2). Chicken manure (521, 833 or 1,563 kg ha(-1)) was applied fortnightly. Results showed that primary productivity was enhanced with maximum average net primary productivity (+/- Standard Error) of 11.7 (+/- 2.5) g O-2 m(-2) day(-1) at the Gaba site and 8.3 (+/- 1.5) g O-2 m(-2) day(-1) at the Walukuba site. Net fish yields were higher in manured ponds with up to 2,670 kg ha(-1) yield for a 310 day growth period compared to less than 700 kg ha(-1) in unmanured ponds. Fish production was limited mainly by high recruitment, falling water levels, light limitation from high suspended solids and turbidity, and low zooplankton biomass. It was concluded that Fingerponds have a high potential for sustainable fish production and can contribute to the alleviation of protein shortages amongst the riparian communities around Lake Victoria. Production can be enhanced further with improved stock management.					van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013														0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2009	17	3					257	277		10.1007/s11273-008-9105-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-008-9105-7													WOS:000265856600007

Evidence for multiple potential drivers of increased phosphorus in high-elevation lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have increased in many remote mountain waterbodies across the western United States, and reports of algal blooms in these systems have increased in frequency. Explanations for observed TP increases are uncertain, and typical landscape drivers, such as agricultural/urban runoff, are implausible. We investigated multiple atmospheric and terrestrial-P loading mechanisms to explain the observed decadal increase in TP, including a novel hypothesis that warming soils may lead to elevated P fluxes to receiving water bodies. Using northern Utah mountains ranges as a case study, we measured prospective inputs of total and bioavailable P via dust deposition. Terrestrial loading was evaluated through soil leaching experiments designed to simulate soil acidification and recovery, as well as observed decadal increases in soil temperatures and extended growing season. In the Uinta Mountains, dust-P flux appears to be one of the most plausible mechanisms for P increases where we estimated bioavailable dust-P loading ranged from 1.6 to 23.1 mg Pm-2 yr(-1). However, our results revealed that an increase of soil pH by 0.5 units could lead to a rise in leached P, ranging from 4.7 to 65 mg P m(-2). Rising temperatures also showed the potential to increase soil P leaching; Observed average historical (similar to +3 degrees C) and future (+2 degrees C) increases in temperature led to a prospective increase in leached P from 2 to 264 mg SRP m(-2). While we found that pH shifts can mobilize significant amounts of P in some locations, we found no evidence of pH changes through time in the Uinta Mountains. However, summer soil temperatures increased at most locations. The mechanisms evaluated in this study can help explain the widespread observed increases in P across Western US lakes, but the mechanisms that dominate in any given region are likely to vary based on local to regional factors.					; Brahney, Janice/H-3591-2019	Brahney, Janice/0000-0001-7614-2855; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 15	2022	825								153939	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153939		FEB 2022						35189218					WOS:000764829300004
J	Wild, M				Wild, Markus			18 KM NORTHWARDS - ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE AHRENSBURGIAN ASSEMBLAGE FROM NAHE LA11 AT LAKE ITZSTEDT (KR. SEGEBERG/D)	ARCHAOLOGISCHES KORRESPONDENZBLATT												The site of Nahe was partly excavated in two seasons in the years 2003 and 2004 in the hope of finding a second Stell-moor. To date, the site has not been published nor studied in any detail. Unfortunately, the stratigraphy of the site is complicated and the number of finds is rather small. A total of 112 reindeer remains was studied zooarchaeologically and technologically. The results indicate that there are at least five individuals in the assemblage. The presence of rich meat-parts indicates that the animals were at least processed locally, and, furthermore, hunted near the site. The processing of the bones led to the high rate of c. 25% anthropogenically modified bones. Different activity patterns can be distinguished from the skinning of animals to the extraction of marrow. The small herd identified points to a herd structure that is typical for the winter season. Taking this into consideration the analysis illustrates the potential of Nahe in the study of Younger Dryas reindeer migration routes as it may be possible that the people in Nahe hunted on the same reindeer herd paths only slightly later in the yearly cycle than the people in Stellmoor. Nevertheless, excavations will be necessary to prove the observed patterns of the zooarchaeological analysis, to further specify the stratigraphical knowledge and to unearth a bone industry to complement existing studies from Stellmoor.																			0342-734X						2017	47	4					441	460																WOS:000431933200002

Sedimentology and palaeontology of the Upper Karoo Group in the Mid-Zambezi Basin, Zimbabwe: new localities and their implications for interbasinal correlation	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												The Triassic-Jurassic Upper Karoo Group of the Mid-Zambezi Basin (MZB; Zimbabwe) includes a thick succession of terrestrial sediments with high palaeontological potential that has been neglected since the 1970s. Here, we review the Upper Karoo Group stratigraphy, present detailed sedimentological work and identify new vertebrate-bearing sites at several measured sections along the southern shore of Lake Kariba. These fossil-bearing sites fall within the Pebbly Arkose and Forest Sandstone formations, and are the first to be recorded from the region since the discovery of Vulcanodon karibaensis nearly 50 years ago. The unique and diverse assemblage of aquatic and terrestrial fauna reported includes phytosaurs, metoposaurid amphibians, lungfish, non-dinosaurian archosauromorphs and non-sauropod sauropodomorph dinosaurs. This improvement of Upper Karoo Group biostratigraphy is important in refining its temporal resolution, and impacts both regional and global studies. Finally, the new fossil sites demonstrate the palaeontological importance of the MZB and its role in providing a holistic understanding of early Mesozoic ecosystems in southern Gondwana.					; Barrett, Paul/A-2648-2010; Barrett, Paul/JAC-4718-2023; Viglietti, Pia/M-4938-2017; Chapelle, Kimberley/ABD-7871-2020	Chapelle, Kimberley/0000-0002-9991-0439; Barrett, Paul/0000-0003-0412-3000; Viglietti, Pia/0000-0003-0102-5632; Choiniere, Jonah/0000-0002-1008-0687													0016-7568	1469-5081				JUN	2021	158	6					1035	1058	PII S0016756820001089	10.1017/S0016756820001089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756820001089													WOS:000652677600006

Out of the 1660 BCM/y of water that falls within the Nile basin, Egypt receives only 55.5 BCM/y representing about 97% of the renewable water resources in Egypt. This is in addition to the groundwater, domestic wastewater, rainfall, and desalinated water. The Blue Nile, the Atbara and the Sobat, all of which rise in Ethiopia, contribute approximately 85% of the Nile waters that reach the Aswan High Dam (AHD). The White Nile, which obtains its water from Lake Victoria and its tributaries, constitutes 15% of the Nile waters. The annual average flow of the Nile waters is 84 BCM/y, as measured at the AHD. Lake Nasser with a storage capacity of 168.9 BCM was created 5 km upstream of Aswan city in Upper Egypt, after the construction of the AHD. In addition, several barrages were erected to control the water level and discharges into the river. Serious efforts must be made by authorities in the Nile basin countries to develop strategies and plans for mitigation and adaptation as the threat of the expected climatic changes might adversely affect the amount of water resources in the Nile basin.

J	Nováková, S				Novakova, Sylvie			Structure and dynamics of the algal flora in subalpine mires in the Krkonose Mountains (Giant Mountains; Czech Republic)	NOVA HEDWIGIA												The algal flora of the pools in a subalpine peatbog and its mineral-ground surroundings was examined. Although the water chemistry (pH, conductivity) seemed to be similar in most of the sampled waterbodies, both environments differed considerably both in the composition of the algal flora and in the number of species. Mineral-ground pools had a more diversified algal flora and were especially rich in diatoms. Three microbiotopes were sampled in all pools: plankton, benthos and metaphyton. Plankton assemblages were the lowest both in the number of species and in their abundance, and their composition varied considerably due to weather changes. Most of the cyanobacteria, diatoms (except the genus Eunotia), euglenophytes, green coccoids and biradiate desmids preferred living in benthos. Metaphyton was preferred by epiphytic species, omniradiate and polyradiate desmids, and cryptophytes and other flagellates living also in the plankton. Seasonal succession, as typical in lakes or ponds, was not observed. The algal flora in the studied pools was subject to short-term fluctuations. However, in spite of the species variations due to weather changes, the differences in total numbers of taxa during the course of year were insignificant. Among the species which displayed noticeable seasonal dynamics a decrease of the population during the summer was the most frequent pattern. This likely corresponds with the psychrophilic character of these species and the arcto-alpine character of the whole local algal flora.																			0029-5035					MAY	2007	84	3-4					441	458		10.1127/0029-5035/2007/0084-0441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0029-5035/2007/0084-0441													WOS:000246117900010
J	Lotter, AF; Bigler, C				Lotter, AF; Bigler, C			Do diatoms in the Swiss Alps reflect the length of ice-cover?	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Diatom analyses in the water column, sediment traps, surficial sediments as well as in a short sediment core from Hagelseewli (2339 m asl, Swiss Alps) give information about the present-day seasonal cycle of diatom blooms, taphonomic processes in the lake basin and the lake's history. Analyses of surficial sediments show that water depth and thus light and nutrient availability is the most important factor influencing the production and distribution of diatom assemblages in Hagelseewli, and that periphytic diatom valves deposited in the deeper part of the basin originate from the shallow, littoral parts and are transported to the central part by processes such as lateral currents or sediment focussing. The lake is characterised by a very short period (2-3 months) of open water. Water-column and sediment-trap data revealed that planktonic diatoms bloom during and after the ice break-up, whereas mainly periphytic Fragilaria species entered the traps during the ice-covered period. These results suggest that plankton development is strongly inhibited by the ice-cover, with longer periods of ice-cover favouring Fragilaria species in Hagelseewli. The diatom analysis of a short sediment core that includes the last five centuries revealed several changes in the proportion of planktonic diatoms to Fragilaria species. The colder phases of the Little Ice-Age correspond to phases of lower concentration of planktonic diatoms. The highest, statistically significant amount of variance in the downcore diatom data is explained by winter precipitation, which directly influences the length of the ice-cover but inversely influences the light regime.

Lacustrine anchor ice has at least four distinct morphologies and was observed on sand, pebble, and boulder substrates in water depths to 4 m, the limit of diving traverses. The maximum depth of anchor ice formation may he much greater. Anchor ice is released from the lake bed on mornings following formation events. Released, floating anchor ice carries sediment to the water surface. This sediment is ice-rafted along shore and offshore under the influence of prevailing winds. We estimate that similar to 0.85 m(3) of sand per meter of beach is being removed from the nearshore zone of southwestern Lake Michigan hy anchor ice annually, Melting ice drops this sand in deep water far from shore. This is a significant loss of sand from the sediment-starved nearshore zone of southwestern Lake Michigan.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				MAY	2001	71	3	A				346	354		10.1306/2DC40948-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/2DC40948-0E47-11D7-8643000102C1865D													WOS:000168458700002

First, the impacts of extreme weather events on the water quality are summarized. Then the influences of long-term climate change on the water quality of different water bodies are discussed, and how changes in climatic factors affect the water quality directly and indirectly by influencing the sources, migration and transformation, biochemical reactions, and ecological effects of pollutants. Furthermore, the methods used to determine the effects of climate change on the water quality, including model simulations, laboratory and mesocosm experiments, and long-term bioindicator monitoring, are subsequently addressed.

The study also revealed a female-biased sex ratio, exceptional growth rates of up to 2.6 mm in two-weeks in spring, and one of the highest fecundities of Western Europe gammarids.

New Zealand risk management approach for toxic cyanobacteria in drinking water	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH												Cyanobacterial blooms are common seasonal phenomena occurring worldwide in fresh, estuarine and coastal waters, including those used for drinking-water supplies, recreation and stock watering. In New Zealand, the frequency of blooms and their geographic spread is likely to grow with increasing eutrophication and global climate change. The New Zealand Ministry of Health has recently developed national criteria for assessing and managing the risk of toxic cyanobacteria in drinking-water supplies. This paper investigates a cyanobacterial bloom incident in the summer 2002/03 in the Waikato River and hydro lakes, which are a major drinking-water supply for Hamilton City and many other smaller towns along the river. The procedures invoked by the Hamilton City Council and other authorities to deal with this bloom event are considered in terms of the best practice of the day and compared with the Drinking-Water Standards for New Zealand 2005. The presence of cyanobacteria has significant economic effects because of increases in water supply treatment costs or the need to use an alternative source, and there are also social effects from the disruption of recreational use of water bodies and loss of confidence in the quality of reticulated, treated water supplies. Notional evaluation of economic cost of monitoring regimes and control, based on the Waikato River cyanobacterial bloom incident, is also given. The multi-barrier and process-control risk management approach, reliant on good vertical communication systems between central and local government, is an advanced approach useful for any country that regularly experiences cyanobacterial problems.																			1326-0200	1753-6405				JUN	2007	31	3					275	281		10.1111/j.1467-842X.2007.00061.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.2007.00061.x								17679248					WOS:000247677100015

Here we report a high-resolution hydrogen isotopic record from Little Pond, Massachusetts, USA, which we compare with other paleoclimate data from the region, including a similar dD record from Blood Pond, Massachusetts. Together the two datasets provide a > 16 ka record of dD variability in the region, affording new insights into Holocene climate history. First, the long-term trends in dD correlate significantly with regional temperatures inferred from alkenone records from nearby areas of the North Atlantic and lake-level inferred changes in precipitation and evaporation. The long-term dD trends reflect a period of maximum regional warmth at ca. 8-6 ka after the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Second, unlike the positive relationship between temperature and dD observed over the long-term and during early events like the Younger Dryas, we find that a series of warm and dry events at 4.9-4.6, 4.2-3.9, 2.9-2.1, and 1.3-1.2 cal kya BP coincide with negative dD excursions from the long trends. These events were likely driven by summer drought dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Beyond Eutrophication: Vancouver Lake, WA, USA as a Model System for Assessing Multiple, Interacting Biotic and Abiotic Drivers of Harmful Cyanobacterial Blooms	WATER												Eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs has contributed to an increase in the magnitude and frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms; however, the interactive effects of nutrient availability (eutrophication) and other abiotic and biotic drivers have rarely been comprehensively studied in the field. We undertook an eight-year (2005-2013) research program that assessed the interaction of multiple factors driving cyanobacterial blooms in Vancouver Lake, a large, shallow eutrophic lake in Washington, USA. Our program consisted of nearly continuous monthly or weekly monitoring of water quality and plankton community composition over eight years, as well as multiple zooplankton grazing experiments over three years. We found a relatively consistent seasonal succession of phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, and a pattern of interacting factors influencing cyanobacterial bloom dynamics. Typically, a combined effect of decreased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), a sudden increase of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (P), and a cascading effect of zooplankton grazing created a perfect storm' of conditions that promoted the rapid proliferation of cyanobacteria over the two to three weeks before a bloom. At the blooms' peaks, cyanobacterial carbon biomass reached as high as 20 mu g L-1, with total [chl a] often exceeding 750 mu g L-1. In the weeks following the blooms' peaks, [PO4-P] and [NH4-N] dropped and copepod feeding rates fell to near zero, whereas microzooplankton grazing rates reached their maxima. Microzooplankton grazing impact, combined with low nutrient availability, then drove down cyanobacteria abundance. Vancouver Lake serves as a model for understanding multiple, interacting drivers of cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in shallow, temperate lakes, and is therefore an important system in which to investigate new questions related to the science and management of harmful algal blooms.					; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017	Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720; 														2073-4441				JUN	2018	10	6							757	10.3390/w10060757	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10060757													WOS:000436515100088

The hypothesis that not only the climatic and pedoclimatic parameters recorded during the summer season but also the ones measured during the previous snow-covered season could contribute to explaining the C and N dynamics in soil and surface water was tested along 10 snow-free seasons in 3 sites in the alpine tundra in the north-western Italian Alps (LTER site Istituto Mosso). Among the considered parameters, the snow cover duration (SCD) exerted a primary control on soil N-NH4+, DOC, C-micr N-micr and DOC:DON ratio, with an inverse relationship. A long SCD might cause the consumption of all the subnival substrata by the soil microorganisms, determining a C starvation during the subsequent snow-free season. An opposite trend was observed for the lake water, where a longer SCD corresponded to a higher content of inorganic N forms. Among the pedoclimatic indices, the number of soil freeze/thaw cycles (FTC) recorded during the snow-covered season had a positive relation with most of soil C and N forms and N-NO3- in lake water. Only the soil DON showed an inverse pattern, and this result is consistent with the hypothesis that FTC released soil DON, subsequently decomposed and mineralized. Only N-NO3- had a significant intraseasonal variability, reaching the highest values in September both in soil and water, revealing a significant slowdown of the contribution of soil N immobilization processes.
