JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Achieving sustainable clear states in eutrophic shallow lakes is challenging due to the lag between nutrient load reductions and ecosystem response, often resulting in regime shifts. Submerged vegetation tends to fall off and float to the surface and block light due to the instability of freshly restored lakes, a key feature in influencing whether lakes deteriorate again. However, the mechanisms linking such transient shading to regime shifts remain unclear. This study conducted in situ experiments that quantified the shading effect of floating submerged vegetation leaves. We introduced the novel parameters, light interception coefficients and function that served as a crucial link between experimental findings and numerical models. Notably, we developed an innovative module specifically designed to assess the impacts of different clearing measures on aquatic ecosystems, which had been seamlessly integrated into the PCLake model. This practical model was applied to Xinglong Lake, recently ecologically restored, to simulate variations in key ecological indicators (total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), submerged vegetation biomass (DVeg)) and identify regime shift thresholds under different nutrient loads, initial time and time intervals of leaf clearing. The experimental results showed that light interception coefficients exhibited a subtle pattern, initially increasing slightly with water depth before declining, ranging from 0.573 m2/kg to 0.982 m2/kg for Vallisneria natans. The scenarios simulations demonstrated that prolonging clearing intervals from 0 to 120 days resulted in elevated TP, TN, and Chl-a concentrations, accompanied by a decline in DVeg, even causing the lake to a turbid state. Resuming daily clearing after a period of cessation proved ineffective in restoring the lake ecosystem if a regime shift had occurred. As nutrient loads and interception coefficients increased, the time intervals for triggering regime shifts shortened. We conservatively recommended that leaf clearing intervals should not exceed 10 days and ideally begin by March to ensure sufficient light for submerged vegetation. The study provides valuable insights into the impact of transient shading from floating leaves on regime shifts and offers scientific guidance for maintaining shallow lakes sustainably clear.

J	VANNI, MJ				VANNI, MJ			EFFECTS OF NUTRIENTS AND ZOOPLANKTON SIZE ON THE STRUCTURE OF A PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY	ECOLOGY												In situ enclosure experiments were conducted over two summers (1980-1981) to assess the effects of nutrient (N and P) enrichment and zooplankton size structure on the phytoplankton community of an oligo-mesotrophic lake containing planktivorous fish and small zooplankton species. Exclusion of fish from the community resulted in an increase in mean individual zooplankton size, primarily because the cladocerans Ceriodaphnia and Diaphanosoma attained larger sizes. In 1980, total cladoceran biomass was also greater in the absence of fish. In 1980, total phytoplankton density was significantly lower in the fishless enclosures (where zooplankton were larger and grazing rates presumably higher), at a given nutrient level. The proportion of phytoplankton density comprising species with gelatinous sheaths or other protective coverings was greater in the fishless enclosures, under both enriched and unenriched conditions, presumably because these species are relatively resistant to zooplankton grazing. In 1981, when lower fish densities were used (than in 1980), total phytoplankton density was lower in the fishles enclosures only toward the end of the experiment and only in unenriched enclosures. In enriched enclosures the presence of fish had no effect on total phytoplankton density. However, the proportion of phytoplankton density made up of small, edible (to zooplankton) phytoplankton species was lower in the absence of fish throughout the experiment in both unenriched and enriched treatments. In both years, nutrient enrichment caused phytoplankton density to increase greatly, in the presence and absence of fish. Nutrient enrichment increased phytoplankton density a much greater amount than did reduction in zooplankton size. The results of these experiments demonstrate that even relatively small changes in zooplankton size (i.e., shifts in size without only small species) can result in significant alterations of the phytoplankton community. However, the increase in zooplankton body size resulting from fish exclusion could not buffer all effects of nutrient enrichment on total phytoplankton density.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	1987	68	3					624	635		10.2307/1938467	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938467													WOS:A1987H301400017

DETAILED STRATIGRAPHY AND DYNAMICS OF CENTRAL YAMAL KHASYREY DURING THE LATE HOLOCENE	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the discussed issue is caused by insufficient knowledge of the stratigraphy and dynamics of peatland of the Western Siberia tundra zone and the impact of permafrost conditions and climate. The main aim of the research is the detailed study of stratigraphic and reconstruction of the dynamics of plant communities, water regimes and geocryological conditions of Central Yamal khasyrey. The methods used in the research: detailed (1...3,5 cm) study of the macro fossils composition and physic-chemical properties of peat, radiocarbon dating (6 dates) peat deposit; reconstruction of phytoceanoses and water regimes by traditional paleoecological methods, reconstruction of paleogeocryological conditions according to paleophytocoenoses successions and peat secondary diagenesis; comparative analysis of the obtained data with the data of reconstructions of regional climate and functional state of mires to other zones and regions. The results. For the first time the authors have obtained the detailed stratigraphy of peat deposits, data on peat density and its organic substance. By the example of the khasyrey in the Lake Sokhonto area of Central Yamal the authors determined the impact of paleocryological conditions on increase of peat decomposition degree and density. They carried out the detailed reconstruction of khasyrey dynamics for the 1300-year period of its formation. Seven large stages and 15 stages with 6 substages of khasyrey formation of interdecadal and century scale were revealed. Water regimes and cryogenic conditions of these stages are in agreement with similar reconstructions data of mires of Western Siberia forest zone and Holarctic cryolithozone regional climate. The authors differentiated 2 periods in which khasyrey surface eras wet: 952...843; 273 cal. yr. BP...2001 yr. The khasyrey surface was drained maximally during 4 periods: 1099...1065 and 1037...984; 719-652; 542...434 cal. yr. BP. The short-term formation of low permafrost mound during periods of 1099...1065; 1008...984 and 719...652 cal. yr. BP is of high probability. Formation of polygonal mire took place during 542...434 cal. yr. BP. Since 434 cal. yr. BP the depth of seasonal thawing increased, and since 330 cal. yr. BP the ice veins started melting, formation of mire with raised-centre polygons was caused by thermokarst and erosion. In 136...91 cal. yr. BP the depth of seasonal thawing decreased. Drainage of a khasyrey surface in a consequence of waters dumping of the khasyrey lake during the wet warm periods took place between 7153 and 1099, 869 and 843 cal. yr. BP; ca. 2003 and 2008 yrs. Thus, climate changes in the Western Siberia tundra were the main cause of pulsating nature of khasyreis in contrast to the more southern areas. Climate influence was direct, through the hydrothermal regime, and indirect, through cryogenic processes in peat deposit and the water table regime of the lake. Optimal conditions for palsa and polygonal mire formation were created with increasing continental climate and summer temperatures during periods of dry cooling.

J	Gall, ARL; Poulin, M; Debroas, D; Flipo, N				Gall, Anne Roue-Le; Poulin, Michel; Debroas, Didier; Flipo, Nicolas			A physical-microbial food web coupled model to study the evolution of the ecological functioning of a new reservoir after its flooding (Sep, Puy de Dome)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The aim of this paper is to understand the temporal changes in planktonic populations and to highlight some important factors that control the biological functioning and evolution of a recently flooded reservoir, the Sep reservoir (Massif Central, France). To achieve this objective, a I D vertical coupled physical-biological model was used and developed. It couples relevant physical processes (dispersion, advection and convection) with biological processes taking into account the complexity of interactions within the microbial food web, including the conventional grazing food chain with a microbial loop. Based on numerous data collected in the field over three summers (1996, 1997, and 1998) since the flooding of the reservoir, the model was applied over this period to investigate the evolution of the biological structure over these 3 years. Two main assumptions were tested: (I) biodegradability of organic matter (OM) increases over time leading to easier assimilation by heterotrophic and mixotrophic organisms: and (2) bioavailability of phosphorus increases over time leading to easier uptake by organisms. Based on an accurate description of the physical behavior of the water column and on numerous physical and biological available data, the evolution of the microbial food web structure was correctly simulated. During the first year of the study, the plankton community was dominated by mixotrophic organisms and bacteria followed by strictly autotrophic plankton. Then, during the second and third years, autotrophic organism biomass became dominant and reached around 64% of the total biomass in 1998. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the initial allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influenced the structure and the functioning of the microbial food web in the reservoir.

The World Health Organization recommends complementing drug treatment with snail control and community involvement for disease elimination, but there is a general lack of snail experts and hence snail distribution data. Therefore, we adopted a citizen science approach and involved citizens in the monitoring of medically and veterinary important snail taxa. Materials and methods Snail data was collected weekly by 25 trained citizen scientists (CSs) at 76 sites around southern Lake Albert (Uganda) for 20 months. At each site, snails were searched for 30 minutes, sorted, target snail hosts identified to genus level, counted and data submitted through a smartphone application. The quality of this data was assessed by comparing it to monthly data collected by an 'expert' malacologist using the same sampling protocol. Generalised binomial logistic and linear mixed-effects models were used to analyse the variables for agreement between the CSs and expert. Findings The binary agreement in presence/absence of Biomphalaria, Bulinus and Radix snails reported by the expert and CSs ranged between 70% and 86% (900 reports) with an average of 17% false negatives (sites wrongly defined as snail-free). The agreement for Biomphalaria and Radix increased with snail abundance, and false negatives decreased when the number of snails collected by citizens was aggregated per month. Site type significantly predicted binary agreement, which was lowest at lake sites (55%) and highest at spring sites (99%) with variations across genera. Similar temporal trends in snail abundance were recorded despite the expert reporting higher abundance. However, the relative abundance was consistent across site types. The match between the sites with highest Biomphalaria spp. abundance identified by CSs and expert was consistently high (similar to 84.1%) and increased over time. Conclusions and recommendations Our results demonstrate the potential of citizen science to map putative schistosomiasis transmission sites. We therefore argue that this inclusive, powerful and cost-effective approach can be more sustainable than top-down monitoring and intervention campaigns.					; Valderrama Bhraunxs, Noelia del Carmen/AAA-2320-2022; Tumusiime, Julius/JAC-6995-2023; Twongyirwe, Ronald/ABG-6250-2021	Huyse, Tine/0000-0001-8164-9757; Twongyirwe, Ronald/0000-0003-3379-7709; Jacobs, Liesbet/0000-0002-1137-5372; Tumusiime, Julius/0000-0002-4822-1078; Tolo, Casim Umba/0000-0003-1807-3438; Valderrama Bhraunxs, Noelia del Carmen/0000-0002-1804-6715													1935-2735					APR	2024	18	4							e0012062	10.1371/journal.pntd.0012062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012062								38574112					WOS:001198067800004
J	Jaquet, JM; Nirel, P; Martignier, A				Jaquet, Jean-Michel; Nirel, Pascale; Martignier, Agathe			Preliminary investigations on picoplankton-related precipitation of alkaline-earth metal carbonates in meso-oligotrophic lake Geneva (Switzerland)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In the course of a routine water-quality survey in meso-oligotrophic lake Geneva (Switzerland), suspended matter was collected by filtration on 0.2 mu m membranes in July and August 2012 at the depth of maximal chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (2 mg m(-3)). Examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of numerous dark and gelatinous patches occluding the pores of the membranes, containing high numbers of picoplanktonic cells and, in places, clusters of medium-to-high-reflectance smooth microspheres (0.6 mu m in diameter). Their chemical composition, determined by semi-quantitative, energy-dispersive X ray spectrometry (EDS) showed magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) (alkaline earth metals) to be the dominant cations. Among the anions, phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) were present, but only the latter is considered here (as carbonate). The microspheres were subdivided into four types represented in a Ca-Sr-Ba ternary space. All types are confined within a domain bound by Ca>45, Sr<10 and Ba<50 (in mole %). Type I, the most frequent, displays a broad variability in Ba/Ca, even within a given cluster. Types II and III are devoid of Ba, but may incorporate P. Type IV contains only Ca. The Type I composition resembles that of benstonite, a Group IIA carbonate that was recently found as intracellular granules in a cyanobacterium from alkaline lake Alchichica (Mexico). Lake Geneva microspheres are solid, featureless and embedded in a mucilage-looking substance in the vicinity of, but seemingly not inside, picoplanktonic cells morphologically similar to Chlorella and Synechococcus. In summer 2012, the macroscopic physico-chemical conditions in lake Geneva epilimnion were such as to allow precipitation of Ca but not of Sr and Ba carbonates. Favourable conditions did exist, though, in the micro-environment provided by the combination of active picoplankton and a mucilaginous envelope. Further studies are ongoing to investigate the vertical distribution of the microspheres, their internal structure and their exact mineralogical composition, as well as the taxonomy of the picoplankton and the nature of the mucilage, in order to gain a proper understanding of this intriguing process of alkaline-earth metals sequestration.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	3					592	605		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e50	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e50													WOS:000326626700018

Mercury and water level management in lakes of northern Minnesota	ECOSPHERE												Water level (WL) fluctuations substantially alter the fauna, flora, and microbial community of nearshore aquatic ecosystems. Water level management therefore has the potential to strongly influence a wide variety of ecosystem processes. Many northern temperate lake food webs experience substantial methylmercury contamination, which is partially mediated by the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria occurring in sediments that are periodically inundated. For lakes with elevated methylmercury, WL management could be designed to reduce methylmercury contamination. At the lake scale, this concept is supported by studies that identified statistical associations between fish mercury content and water level (WL) fluctuations. Here, we compiled a long-term dataset (1997-2015) of mercury content in young-of-year Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) from six lakes on the border of the United States and Canada and examined whether mercury content was associated with WL fluctuation. Many WL metrics covary and appear to have strong associations with Yellow Perch mercury. However, these associations appear to vary by lake, and lake-specific models are needed to identify relationships between WL fluctuation and Yellow Perch mercury content. We used partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to identify the associations between Yellow Perch mercury content and WL metrics, temperature, and annual deposition data for lakes in northern Minnesota. These PLSR models not only showed some variation among lakes, but also supported strong associations between WL fluctuations and annual variation in Yellow Perch mercury content. The study lakes underwent a change in WL management in 2000, when winter WL minimums were increased by about 1 m in five of the six study lakes, which reduced annual WL fluctuation on those lakes. Using the PLSR models, we estimated how this change in WL management would have affected Yellow Perch mercury content. In four of the five study lakes in which annual WL fluctuation was reduced in 2000, the change in WL management likely reduced Yellow Perch mercury content, relative to the previous WL management regime.

Palaeoenvironmental evolution of Lake Gacko (Southern Bosnia and Herzegovina): Impact of the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum on the Dinaride Lake System	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												In the Early to Middle Miocene, a series of lakes, collectively termed the Dinaride Lake System (DLS), spread out across the north-western part of the Dinaride-Anatolian continental block. Its deposits, preserved in numerous intra-montane basins, allow a glimpse into the palaeoenvironmental, palaeobiogeographic and geodynamic evolution of the region. Lake Gacko, situated in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina, is one of the constituent lakes of the DLS, and its deposits are excellently exposed in the Gracanica open-cast coal-mine. A detailed study of the sedimentary succession that addresses facies, sediment petrography, geophysical properties, and fossil mollusc palaeoecology reveals repetitive changes in lake level. These are interpreted to reflect changes in the regional water budget. First-order chronologic constraints arise from the integration of radio-isotopic and palaeomagnetic data. 40Ar/39Ar measurements on feldspar crystals from a tephra bed in the upper part of the sedimentary succession indicate a 15.31 +/- 0.16 Ma age for this level. The reversed magnetic polarity signal that characterises the larger part of the investigated section correlates to chron C5Br of the Astronomically Tuned Neogene Timescale. Guided by these chronologic data and a detailed cyclostratigraphic analysis, the observed variations in lake-level, evident as two similar to 40-m and seven similar to 10-m scale transgression-regression cycles, are tuned to similar to 400-kyr and similar to 100-kyr eccentricity cycles. From the tuning, it can be inferred that the sediments in the Gacko Basin accumulated between similar to 15.8 and similar to 15.2 Ma. The economically valuable lignite accumulations in the lower part of the succession are interpreted to indicate the development of swamp forests in conjunction with lake-level falls corresponding to similar to 100-kyr eccentricity minima. Pedogenesis, rhizoliths and palustrine carbonate breccias in the upper part of the section reveal long-term aridity coinciding with a similar to 400-kyr eccentricity minimum. Eccentricity maxima are interpreted to trigger lake-level high-stands. These are accompanied by eutrophication events caused by enhanced denudation of the surrounding basement and increased detrital input into the basin. The presented age model proves that Lake Gacko arose during the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum and that the optimum climatic conditions triggered the formation of this long-lived lake.

J	Zielinski, RA; Simmons, KR; Orem, WH				Zielinski, RA; Simmons, KR; Orem, WH			Use of 234U and 238U isotopes to identify fertilizer-derived uranium in the Florida Everglades	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Surface water and peat in the northern Everglades have very low natural concentrations of U and are therefore sensitive to the addition of small amounts of U from anthropogenic sources such as fertilizer. Feat samples collected along a nutrient gradient in the northern Everglades have unusually high concentrations of U (> 1 mu g/g, dry basis) and also have a distinctive U-234/U-238 activity ratio (AR). AR values for U-enriched pear fall in the narrow range of AR values for commercial phosphate fertilizer (1.00 +/- 0.05). In contrast,AR values for low-U peal from background sites exceed 1.05. The spatial distribution of anomalous U concentration, and of fertilizer-like AR values in peat, parallel a previously documented pattern of P enrichment. These results strongly suggest that some of the U in nutrient-impacted peatlands is fertilizer-derived. Agricultural drainage water sampled in the northern Everglades has high concentrations of dissolved U (0.3-2.4 mu g/l) compared to surface water from background sites (<0.1 mu g/l). Measured AR values in drainage water (0.949-0.990) are also permissive of a fertilizer origin for the U and are different from AR values in surface water or peat at background sites (AR > 1.05). Synoptic sampling of surface water along drainage canals indicate that Lake Okeechobee, and some drainage from agricultural fields, are sources of dissolved U, whereas wetlands farther downstream act as sinks for U, Historically cultivated agricultural soil has only a marginally elevated (+ 0.2 mu g/g) average concentration of U compared to nearby uncultivated soil and incorporates only 20% of the U from an aqueous solution that was slurried with the soil. In contrast, a Similar experiment with fresh Everglades pear indicated uptake of 90% of the added U, These experiments support the proposed removal of U from agricultural fields and concentration of U in downstream peatlands. The methodology of this study can be used to describe the behavior of fertilizer-derived U in other low-U environments.

Pat, III; Seyfried, William E., Jr.			Geochemical heterogeneity of sublacustrine hydrothermal vents in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												ROV-based submersible operations in Yellowstone Lake (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA) have identified two locations with chemically and mineralogically distinct sublacustrine hydrothermal fluids and deposits: The Deep Hole east of Stevenson Island (SI Deep Hole) and the SE West Thumb Deep Vent field (SE WT Field). The SI Deep Hole is the deepest part of Yellowstone Lake (120 m), and hosts up to 174 degrees C fluids heated by steam that condenses on contact with cold lake water. The resulting hot fluids exit through a clay alteration cap that largely consists of kaolinite. The SI Deep Hole hydrothermal vents are analogous to steam-heated hot springs elsewhere in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) (e.g. the Mud Volcano area), which are typified by fumaroles and acid-sulfate fluids. These deep sublacustrine vent fluids are more aptly termed "carbonic-acid-sulfide", owing to a lack substantial sulfate from H2S oxidation and acidity attributed to dissolved CO2. At 53 m depth, vent fluids at the SE WT Field achieve temperatures of up to 141 degrees C. These neutral-chloride fluids are largely similar to those that produce siliceous deposits in many subaerial YNP geyser basins. Geothermometry calculations and binary mixing relationships indicate the SE WT Field fluids equilibrated at 207 to 224 degrees C following mixing between oxygenated dilute cold groundwater and a fluid with T = 345 to 364 degrees C, Cl = 400 ppm, and delta D = -149 parts per thousand (VSMOW); broadly similar to the putative deep parent fluid that supplies most geyser basins in YNP. The delta D values of SE WT Field fluids cannot be derived from lake water, implying km-scale lateral hydrothermal fluid flow from outside the boundary of Yellowstone Lake. The fluid compositions and hydrothermal processes operating in the two sublacustrine vent systems are distinct but the overarching influence of magmatic heating, complex degassing, and alteration mineralization effects are broadly comparable to those that affect their subaerial counterparts. The high temperatures and hydrostatic pressures of the sublacustrine vents, however, provide a window into the evolution of fluid chemistry in more deeply seated and less accessible regions of the subsurface YNP and similar volcanically active hydrothermal systems elsewhere.

The experiment was conducted in large containers (mesocosms) subjected to 1 of the following UVBR regimes: excluded UVBR (WUVB), natural UVBR (NUVB), and natural UVBR enhanced with either 2 lamps (LUVB) or 3 lamps (HUVB). incubations with fluorescently labeled bacteria were conducted daily as a tool to understand the interaction between the potential bacterivores (heterotrophic ciliates and nanoflagellates) and bacteria within the studied system. UVBR intensities had no significant effects on the estimated clearance and ingestion rates (CR and IR, respectively) until Day 5 of the experiment. During the following 2 d, characterized by low nutrient concentration, both CR and IR decreased with the increase of the daily UVBR (at 305 and 320 nm) doses received. The maximum difference between treatments was observed on Day 7, where both clearance and ingestion rate values in the NUVB, LUVB and HUVB treatments were significantly lower than the WUVB treatment. Our data suggest that over a 1 d period and under conditions of high nutrient concentrations, protozoan bacterivory is not affected by UVBR increases. When nutrient concentrations become low, bacterivores become more susceptible to damaging UVBR effects. We think that the deterioration of food quality, itself resulting from the synergistic action of nutrients and UVBR stresses, is responsible for the increased sensitivity of bacterivores to UVBR. UVBR-induced decreases in bacterivory would represent a considerable loss to the higher tropic levels that feed upon bacterivores.

J	FAIRCHILD, WL; EIDT, DC				FAIRCHILD, WL; EIDT, DC			PERTURBATION OF THE AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY OF ACIDIC BOG PONDS BY THE INSECTICIDE FENITROTHION	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												In forest areas receiving aerial application of pesticides, small bodies of water, which are often difficult to see from low-flying spray planes, are at risk of receiving high concentrations of contaminants. To determine the sensitivity of bog pond invertebrate communities, formulated fenitrothion was applied at ground level with a mist blower to four acidic bog ponds near Lake George, New Brunswick, Canada. Fenitrothion fate and persistence, insect emergence, gyrinid populations, and the invertebrate community inhabiting the floating sphagnum fringe of the ponds were sampled before and after treatment. The invertebrate community was sensitive to formulated fenitrothion. Concentrations of fenitrothion in bog pond water were in ranges that would be expected after a direct aerial application, with no buffer zone, of 2 x 210 g active-ingredient/ha, the operational emission rate used for spruce budworm. Insect emergence was reduced compared to control ponds for 6-12 weeks following fenitrothion treatment. The population densities of Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae were reduced by more than 50% for 1 month after treatment. The densities of most other benthic insect taxa were also reduced. Some reductions in density lasted over winter into the next year. This contrasted with the usual small and transitory effects of fenitrothion on aquatic invertebrate communities in streams or large lakes. Insecticide-induced suppression of aquatic insects and adult insect emergence in the small bog ponds allowed Hydrachnellae, Oligochaeta, and Nematoda to dominate the aquatic invertebrate community. Export of energy and nutrients to the terrestrial system through insect emergence was thus reduced and cycling or retention within the aquatic system increased. Sustained suppression of insect emergence could result in nutrient accumulation in the ponds. Substantially reduced insect emergence would be expected to have effects on dependent predators in the bog ecosystem.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				AUG	1993	25	2					170	183																WOS:A1993LH96500004

Regression equations were established, and the main results were as follows: (1)The daily maximum temperature, daily average temperature, and daily minimum temperature change curves of asphalt underlay were significantly higher than those of other underlay, and the change trends of grassland, woodland, and wetland were the same, and the curves were close to each other. (2)The maximum and minimum temperatures of the four types of underlayment were ranked as asphalt > wetland > forestland > grassland. (3)The maximum surface temperatures of the four types of underlayment were positively correlated with the daily maximum air temperature and solar radiation, with correlation coefficients around 0.9, and negatively correlated with the daily total cloudiness and the daily maximum relative humidity, with correlation coefficients above 0.5. (4)The four types of sub surface maximum temperature forecasts are well fitted to the observed values, with correlation coefficients of 0.70 or more, and the error results are within the acceptable range, which can meet the needs of high-temperature forecasting, among which the grassy subsurface has the best fit, with a correlation coefficient of 0.90.The results have certain reference significance for knowing thermal environment of different urban underlying surfaces, while. providing scientific evidence for the development of refined urban meteorological forecasting services.																			1865-0473	1865-0481				DEC 1	2024	17	6					5095	5105		10.1007/s12145-024-01439-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-024-01439-8		AUG 2024											WOS:001291029300002
J	Palatov, DM; Marin, IN				Palatov, D. M.; Marin, I. N.			A NEW GENUS OF THE FAMILY CRANGONYCTIDAE (CRUSTACEA, AMPHIPODA) FROM THE PALAEARCTIC, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO NEW SPECIES FROM THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ALTAI MOUNTAINS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												An overview of stygobiotic crangonyctid amphipods from the Altai Republic, Russia is presented, with the erection of the new genus Palearcticarellus Palatov et Marin gen. n. for three previously described Stygobromus-like species, as well as two new species: Palearcticarellus smirnovi Palatov et Marin sp. n. from several localities in the drainage basins of the Biya and Katun rivers, and Palearcticarellus sapozhnikovi Palatov et Marin sp. n. from the springs around Lake Kureevo. Three previously known species are transferred to the new genus: Palearcticarellus pusillus (Martynov 1930) comb. n., P. mikhaili (Sidorov, Holsinger et Takhteev 2010) comb. n., both endemic to the Altai Republic, and P. kazakhstanica (Kulkina 1992) comb. n., from the northern Tian Shan. The new genus is morphologically (but not phylogenetically) very similar to the North American Stygobromus in also demonstrating some troglomorphic features, including depigmented integuments and reduced eyes, but it can be separated by 1) the presence of coxal gills 7; 2) less than 6 plumose setae (bristles) on the inner plate of maxilla 1; and 3) the presence of 2-5 hooks in the retinacle of the pleopods. At the same time, a molecular study reveals that the new genus represents a well-isolated and well-supported sister Glade to the Eurasian Synurella-related genera: the Caucasian Lyurella, the northeastern (Siberian) Synurella (= Eosynurella), and the northwestern (European) Synurella. However, it can clearly be separated from these genera by 1) free, non-fused uronites; 2) blunt posteroventral margins of epimeral plates 1-3; as well as 3) an unpigmented body; 4) mostly reduced eyes; 5) the presence of 2-5 hooks in the retinacle of the pleopods; and 6) the armature of gnathopods 1 and 2 (palmar margins of both gnathopods being armed with a double row of bifurcate robust setae, similar to those in most of North American species, but not Palaearctic ones). The new species can easily be distinguished from each other by 1) the number of hooks in the retinacle of the pleopods; 2) the shape of both gnathopods; 3) the shape and depth of a distal notch on the telson, and 4) the armature of uropod 3. The morphology and body size of smaller species of Palearcticarellus Palatov et Marin gen. n. (e.g., P. pusillus and P. mikhaili) are assumed to be more closely related to their neotenic origins rather than troglomorphy, the latter being more characteristic of larger species (e.g., P. smirnovi and P. sapozhnikovi).

J	Gu, J; Liu, G; Abd Elbasit, MAM; Shi, HQ				Gu Ju; Liu Gang; Abd Elbasit, Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed; Shi Hong-qiang			Response of slope surface roughness to wave-induced erosion during water level fluctuating	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												The bank slopes in hydro-fluctuation areas of reservoirs or lakes suffer from severe erosion due to an absence of protection. Waves are one of the important external forces that cause bank erosion and slope failures. However, the processes and quantified impacts of wave-induced erosion on slopes remain unclear under different water level-fluctuation conditions. This paper focuses on the characteristics of wave-induced slope erosion under three conditions: water level dropping (WLD), fixed (WLF) and rising (WLR). A steel tank with glass pane was used to simulate the wave-induced slope erosion in the three treatments. The slope elevation data were collected by using the method of the pin meter for every 15 minutes from the beginning to the end, a total of 5 times during all treatments. These data were processed by using software (SURFER 9.0) to get the slope micro-topography and the erosion volume. Then the temporal and spatial change of slope erosion was analysed according to the erosion amount or erosion rate calculated based on bulk density of slope soil. The results demonstrated that the soil erosion rates for different water level changing treatments are in the following order: WLR>WLD>WLF. For the erosion spatial variation, the middle part of the slope was the major source of sediment in the WLD. The upper part of the slope was the major source of the sediment for the other two treatments. Compared with the standard deviation (SD), the coefficient of variation (CV) based on the SD is more representative of variations in the soil surface roughness (SSR). Furthermore, the good fit between the SSR and soil erosion rate have the potential to be used to predict soil erosion. Above all, the injection angle of the wave determined the rate of erosion to some extent, and the fall-back flow of the wave could also influence the extent of erosion, deposition, and bank morphology. It is vital to choose the appropriate index (SD or CV) in the three water levels to improve the prediction accuracy. This paper could provide scientific knowledge to manage reservoirs or river banks.

J	Elverland, E; Vorren, KD				Elverland, Ellen; Vorren, Karl-Dag			7500 yr of mire-pool development and the history of Pinus sylvestris (L.) in Sub-Arctic coastal Norway	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												In coastal North Norway, mire areas and mire pools frequently exist, but their development and time of origin are poorly known. In order to investigate the development of a coastal mire pool and relate its changes to known climatic changes, a sediment sequence from the mire-pool Lillevardhaugvatnet (c. 0.05 ha large), was C-14-dated, investigated for loss on ignition and analysed for pollen and botanical macrofossils. The bottom of the sequence dates c. 7500 cal. BP. The site gradually developed from a swamp forest c. 6200 cal. BP via a more open dwarf-shrub phase to a pool c. 5000 cal. BP. The pool grew in depth as the result of continuous peat growth damming the water body. The water level of the pool was probably lowered by erosional drain c. 2700 cal. BP. Redeposited peat in the sequence occurred c. 2100 cal. BP and c. 1100 cal. BP. C-14-dates and pollen indicate that erosion and redeposition of the peat surrounding the mire pool is a normal process, connected with the expansion of the water body. The combination of macrofossils and pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of R sylvestris indicates that in small lakes in coastal areas of North Norway, a PAR of 200-400 cm(-2) yr(-1) is sufficient for indicating local presence of P. sylvestris. P sylvestris is represented with abundant macrofossils between 4800 and 2100 cal. BR It is suggested that a marked R sylvestris decrease about 2100 cal. BP may be a combined effect of human impact and climatic deterioration. A possible final termination of the R sylvestris population about 1600 cal. BP may be considered human-made.

J	Gettel, GM; Giblin, AE; Howarth, RW				Gettel, Gretchen M.; Giblin, Anne E.; Howarth, Robert W.			The effects of grazing by the snail, Lymnaea elodes, on benthic N2 fixation and primary production in oligotrophic, arctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study assessed whether grazing by the snail, Lymnaea elodes, limits benthic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation and primary production in nitrogen (N)-limited oligotrophic lakes near Toolik Field Station on the North Slope of Alaska. We also tested whether snail excretion increased N and the ratio of N and phosphorus (P) supply ratio to benthic algae, which could indirectly affect production and the N-2 fixation rate. We performed in situ, randomized-block experiments in two lakes in 3 years in which snail density was manipulated and compared to open cage controls. Snails significantly decreased areal rates of N-2 fixation in both lakes in all years (p < 0.05), but did not appear to cause a reduction in cyanobacterial abundance or filament size (p > 0.05). Snails did not significantly affect measures of benthic production, including gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem production, and chlorophyll biomass (p > 0.05). Snail-induced declines in N-2 fixation probably did not result from snail excretion. The molar N : P excretion ratio of ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO4+) was very low (4.8), indicating that snails likely exacerbated N limitation, a response that would tend to favor enhanced rather than reduced N-2 fixation. Furthermore, the excretion rate of N-NH4+ was several orders of magnitude lower than the N-2 fixation rate (0.002-0.02 mg N m(-2) day(-1) vs. 0.1-0.4 mg N m(-2) day(-1), respectively) and met almost none (<< 1%) of the N demand by primary producers. Although the mechanism by which Lymnaea elodes caused a decline in N-2 fixation is unknown, the effect was small, and accounted for a reduction of N inputs of only 0.12 mg N m(-2) summer(-1) or by 0.85-1.8% at ambient snail densities. Because N-2 fixation is a new N input able to support new production, this effect may be important across long time scales or where densities of L. elodes are higher.					; Gettel, Gretchen/M-8983-2013; Giblin, Anne/AEK-5137-2022	Giblin, Anne/0000-0003-3851-2178; Gettel, Gretchen/0000-0002-9288-1583; Howarth, Robert/0000-0001-9531-4288; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2007	52	6					2398	2409		10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2398	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.6.2398													WOS:000251129700008
J	SHEN, PY; BECK, AE				SHEN, PY; BECK, AE			PALEOCLIMATE CHANGE AND HEAT-FLOW DENSITY INFERRED FROM TEMPERATURE DATA IN THE SUPERIOR PROVINCE OF THE CANADIAN SHIELD	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Four boreholes, located near Cochrane, Hearst, Minchin Lake, and Otoskwin River in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield, were logged in 1969/1970, and again in the summer of 1985. We have used the obtained temperature-depth (T-z) data and the thermal property measurements to estimate the ground surface temperature (GST) histories and the heat flow densities at these sites, using a least squares inverse method. The method employs the theory of heat conduction in a laterally homogeneous Earth and the concept of incorporating a priori information to stabilize and uniquely determine the solution. We formulate the least squares optimization problem in the functional spaces and solve it with a quasi-Newton iterative gradient method. The functional space formulation allows the gradient operator to be obtained by solving only forward problems and the quasi-Newton method, which has a second order convergence, allows the a posteriori covariance operator to be readily computed. Except for the Cochrane hole, where systematic errors appear to exist in the temperature measurements, the two T-z logs for each hole, whether inverted individually or simultaneously, yield highly consistent, though not identical, results. All of the estimated GST histories, except that for Otoskwin River, exhibit a broad low centered around 1800 A.D. (the Little Ice Age), preceeded by a warm period in the Mid-Holocene (the Little Climatic Optimum) and followed by a warming trend in the last 100 years. However, the GST histories differ significantly from hole to hole in terms of the amplitude and the timing of their temporal variations. This suggests that the T-z data may have been significantly perturbed by local topography, lateral heterogeneities in the subsurface thermal properties, groundwater circulation, etc., which are not taken into account in the theory of one-dimensional heat conduction.																			0921-8181					DEC	1992	98	2-4					143	165																WOS:A1992KF79900008

Sediment analysis revealed two akinete species, Dolichospermum macrosporum and Dolichospermum flos-aquae, present in the same proportions as observed for the pelagic populations. Moreover, similar spatial patterns observed for vegetative cells in the water column and akinete distributions in the sediment suggest that akinetes in the sediment may be representative of the previous bloom. However, the relationship between akinetes in the sediment and vegetative cells in the water column was not linear, and other factors may interfere. For example, our results highlighted horizontal transport of akinetes during the winter. The benthic overwinter phase did not seem to influence the percentages of intact akinetes, which remained stable at approximately 7% and 60% for D. macrosporum and D. flos-aquae, respectively. These percentages may thus be the result of processes that occurred in the water column. The intact overwintering akinetes showed germination rates of up to 90% after 72 h for D. flos-aquae or 144 h for D. macrosporum. The difference in akinete germination rates between these two species demonstrates different ecological strategies, which serve to expand the window for germination in time and space and thus optimize colonization of the water column by nostocalean cyanobacteria. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria have the ability to proliferate and to form blooms. These blooms can then affect the local ecology, health, and economy. The akinete, a resistant cell type that persists in sediment, is an important intermediate phase between previous and future blooms. We monitored the water column and the surface sediment of a French eutrophic lake (Lake Aydat) to investigate the relationship between vegetative cells in the water column and akinetes in the sediment. This study focused on the characterization of spatiotemporal akinete distributions, cellular integrity, and germination potential. Species-specific ecological strategies were highlighted and may partly explain the temporal succession of species in the water column. Akinetes may also be used to understand past nostocalean blooms and to predict future ones.

J	Belzile, C; Vincent, WF; Kumagai, M				Belzile, C; Vincent, WF; Kumagai, M			Contribution of absorption and scattering to the attenuation of UV and photosynthetically available radiation in Lake Biwa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Underwater ultraviolet (UV) attenuation is typically modeled using correlative relationships between UV attenuation and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption. Our objective was to validate and extend a biogeooptical model of UV penetration that would take into account total absorption as well as scattering by all components of the water column. Diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d(lambda), for photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and UV irradiance were measured using a PUV500 radiometer at 13 stations in Lake Biwa, Japan, in late summer. Absorption, a, and scattering, b, were measured at nine PAR wavelengths using an AC-9 absorption-attenuation meter. The average K-d(PAR) through the euphotic zone, K-dav(PAR), was estimated from the measured inherent optical properties using Kirk's equations derived from Monte Carlo simulations. The modeled K-dav(PAR) was strongly correlated with measured K-d(PAR) values (r(2) = 0.998), although the model systematically underestimated measured values by greater than or equal to15%. The relative contribution of absorption and scattering to UV attenuation was evaluated from measurements of the absorption coefficients, an extrapolation of b into the UV, and Kirk's equations. The UV-absorption coefficients for CDOM and particulate matter were measured spectrophotometrically. There was a close agreement between modeled and measured K-d(UV) values (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.990). The Lake Biwa data showed that particulate absorption and scattering play significant roles in UV attenuation; on average, absorption by water, CDOM, and particles contributed 1, 66, and 21% respectively to K-dav(340), while scattering by particles contributed 11%. At a turbid site (NS9) absorption by water, CDOM, and particles contributed 0.3, 40, and 36% respectively to K-dav(340), while scattering contributed the remaining 24%. The model described here integrates the effects of all absorption as well as scattering components and provides a more accurate estimate of underwater UV exposure than previous approaches based on CDOM absorption only.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Belzile, Claude/0000-0003-3908-7433; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2002	47	1					95	107		10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0095	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0095													WOS:000173529200010

TECHNIQUES OF WASTEWATER REFINEMENT USING THE WETLAND SYSTEM FOR THE VILLAGE OF GLOZAN. MODALITIES AND COMPARATIVE LEGAL REVIEW	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS												Technique of refinement of settlements wastewater by using the system of wetlands has also a legislative basis, in conformity with which it is being conducted. USA have the best regulation of legal frames of these contemporary techniques. In the European Union we can just spot the tendency of legislators towards regulation of this phenomenon. The situation in Serbia, as far as this advanced system of wastewater refinement is concerned, is according to current laws still stagnant. In the countries which have not defined legislation in this field, provisions of the Clean Water Act which are suitable for implementation and rich court practice of USA in this field, which is empirical indicator of the quality of legal provisions, represent the foundation for specific national legislative frames. The regulatory philosophy contained in the Clean Water Act is referred to as the command-and-control, or standards-and-enforcement, method. For example the Clean Water Act provides that the administrator shall develop and operate a continuing program of public information and education on recycling and reuse of wastewater (including sludge), the use of land treatment, and methods for the reduction of wastewater volume. Technically wise the solution is highly applicable and suitable. The system for refinement consists of several lagoons arranged in cascade isolated with foil and filled with substrate, which prevents the formation of foul smell and gathering of undesired insects near water. Toxic matters are being disintegrated in the process of refinement, partially incorporating into the plants, partially remaining in the oxidation processes, from where it is easily eliminated in cyclic periods from the first lagoons, without large expenses. Wetlands are efficient in eliminating nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds, heavy metals and other toxic matters from wastewater and therefore protect ground waters, springs of drinking water, watercourses and lakes (70-90%), efficiently decreasing the number of fecal and other bacteria (90-99%).					; Bjelajac, Zeljko/AAJ-3467-2020	Bjelajac, Zeljko/0000-0003-4953-8779; Dukic Mijatovic, Marijana/0000-0003-1327-0889; 													0209-4541						2012	35	1					201	210																WOS:000302588100024
J	Henry, CR; Walters, MB				Henry, Catherine R.; Walters, Michael B.			Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) age structure reveals limited establishment and development of age cohorts in response to selection management in northern hardwood forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Single-tree selection (STS) silviculture has dominated management of northern hardwood forests (NHFs) in the Great Lakes region since introduction the 1960's. Periodic partial cuttings are assumed to promote and recruit well-stocked natural regeneration, resulting in balanced uneven-aged stand structure with sustainable harvest volumes. However, low sapling density of tree species desirable for management, including typically dominant and economically valuable sugar maple (Acer saccharum), suggests STS may not be effectively recruiting sugar maple in some regions. Few studies have analyzed sugar maple size-age structure to determine whether recruitment failure has been chronic since partial cutting began or is a more recent phenomenon. Here, we analyzed sugar maple age structure, regional patterns, and possible drivers for 51 selection-managed NHF stands located in northern Michigan, USA. Our data were 1499 aged basal discs collected from stumps of sugar maple trees >5 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) harvested winter 2017-2018. Our results offer little evidence to suggest that partial cuttings have promoted well-stocked ingrowth of sugar maple saplings. For most stands, age and diameter were non-linearly related, with a wide range of larger-diameter trees having similar ages. Among stands, sugar maple sawtimber (>24 cm DBH) averaged 106 years old and poletimber (11.4-24 cm DBH) 91 years, along with older than expected saplings (5-11.4 cm DBH) averaging 67 years. Most stands were dominated by a similar to 100-year-old upper canopy cohort, with a majority having <= 2 younger cohorts typically of low density and >50 years old. Areas with greater snow water equivalent and lower January minimum temperatures, where deer populations have been historically low, generally have younger sugar maple saplings. Low density and generally old age of smaller size classes led to much lower stocking of age classes <70 years old than expected under STS. Together, this suggests long-term STS management for sugar maple may be unsustainable over large portions of the study region if current trends in forest and deer management continue. Our age structure analysis supports the growing consensus that alternative management may be needed for NHF in parts of the Great Lakes region.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT 15	2023	546								121356	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121356		AUG 2023											WOS:001075958600001

In Europe, avian schistosomes of the genus Trichobilharzia are the most common etiological agents involved in human cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch). Manifested by a skin rash, the condition is caused by an allergic reaction to cercariae of nonhuman schistosomes. Humans are an accidental host in this parasite's life cycle, while water snails are the intermediate, and waterfowl are the final hosts. The study aimed to conduct a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of Trichobilharzia species occurring in recreational waters in North-Eastern Poland. Methodology . The study area covered three water bodies (Lake Skanda, Lake Ukiel, and Lake Tyrsko) over the summer of 2021. In total, 747 pulmonate freshwater snails ( Radix spp ., Lymnaea stagnalis ) were collected. Each snail was subjected to 1-2 h of light stimulation to induce cercarial expulsion. The phylogenetic analyses of furcocercariae were based on the partial sequence of the ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, ITS2 and 28SrDNA). For Radix spp. phylogenetic analyses were based on the ITS-2 region. Results . The prevalence of the Trichobilharzia species infection in snails was 0.5%. Two out of 478 (0.4%) L. stagnalis were found to be infected with Trichobilharzia szidati. Moreover, two out of 269 (0.7%) snails of the genus Radix were positive for schistosome cercariae. Both snails were identified as Radix auricularia . One of them was infected with Trichobilharzia franki and the other with Trichobilharzia sp. Conclusions . Molecular identification of avian schistosome species, both at the intermediate and definitive hosts level, constitutes an important source of information on a potential threat and prognosis of local swimmer's itch occurrence, and helps to determine species diversity in a particular area.

Besides such well-recognized ancient or long-lived lakes as Baikal, Biwa, Ohrid, and Tanganyika, there are other potentially old and biodiverse lakes in the world with poorly specified ages and under-studied faunas. We here report on the mollusc fauna of one such lake, Lake Trichonis in continental Greece. This graben lake is situated in a highly tectonized area, characterized by karst features and probably of middle to late Pliocene origin. Lake Trichonis is deep, oligotrophic, and rich in such specific habitat types as macrophyte meadows, rocky shores and sublacustrine spring systems. Moreover, it is a hotspot of freshwater biodiversity in Greece, particularly in molluscs. After reviewing newly collected material and the published mollusc records, we found that at least 33 mollusc species occur in Lake Trichonis, with 24 gastropod and 9 bivalve species currently being recognized. This is 24% of the total freshwater mollusc diversity of Greece; 21% of the gastropods (five species) are endemic to Lake Trichonis. If the whole Trichonis Basin is considered, which also includes neighboring Lake Lysimachia, eight species (33%) of the total fauna appear to be endemic. Taking lake surface areas into account, the index of gastropod endemism of 0.442 (log N-endemic (species)/log A(surface) (area)) for the Lake Trichonis Basin resembles on a world-wide scale values known for Lake Baikal, Russia, and Lake Biwa, Japan, and is only exceeded by Lake Ohrid, Macedonia/Albania, and ancient lakes of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Despite the limited knowledge about the lake's evolutionary history, the suggested age of origin, the palaeogeographical characteristics, and the potential timing of phylogenetic events reviewed here support the presumed status of Lake Trichonis as an ancient lake. From a conservational standpoint, more research, management and conservation efforts are necessary because ancient lakes are among the most vulnerable and threatened ecosystems on earth. Effects of human-induced environmental change are already noticeable in Lake Trichonis. Recognition of Lake Trichonis as a unique system with an unusually high biodiversity may help promoting conservation efforts.					; Wilke, Thomas/G-1517-2012	Hauffe, Torsten/0000-0001-5711-9457; Wilke, Thomas/0000-0001-8263-7758													0076-2997	2168-9075					2009	51	2					357	375		10.4002/040.051.0209	http://dx.doi.org/10.4002/040.051.0209													WOS:000269434500009

Qualification of Polar Remotely Operated Vehicle at East Antarctica	OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE MONTEREY					MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference	SEP 19-23, 2016	Monterey, CA	MTS, IEEE				National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) under the aegis of Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India has developed a Mini work class Polar Remotely Operated Vehicle (PROVe) for polar studies. PROVe is an unmanned, free swimming underwater vehicle. As part of the 34thIndian scientific expedition to Antarctica (ISEA) a team of six members from NIOT participated in the summer expedition in 2015 and carried out system functionality qualification in polar environment at a temperature range from -5 degrees C to -20-5 degrees C and scientific studies with connected scientific payloads using PROVe at Antarctica. PROVe was mobilized to Antarctica and deployed at Priyadarshini Lake near MAITRI station (Indian Base station at Antarctica) during February 2015. PROVe maneuverability with connected sensor were tested successfully and collected high resolution video images of algal mats covered over the glacial debris. All the operations were tested and the technology use in this epi-continental lake had been proved for further scientific studies in near future. After completion of the exploration at the lake, all the subsystems of PROVe were mobilized to ship by helicopter from Maitri station and reassembled onboard Ivan Papanin to study the Ice shelf at New Indian Barrier. ROV dived up to 62 m water depth successfully and during the dives the ice shelf continuity beyond 62 m depth was recorded. System functionality of all subsystems such as mini deck power converter, control console, umbilical cable, ROV thrusters, electronics and electrical components, poly-propylene frame, buoyancy module, "O" rings designed by NIOT for the low temperature polar environment was tested successfully. During the PROVe trial scientific data such as water temperature, salinity, irradiance, water sampling etc apart from color and black & white camera footings were also successfully collected. This article explains underwater vehicle technology development and its outcome during the exploratory first step in the polar environment of East Antarctic.					; M A, Atmanand/A-1610-2016	Narayanan, Sathia/0000-0002-5227-4025; 															978-1-5090-1537-5				2016										10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761382													WOS:000399929002064

Most thermophilic hydrogenogenic CO utilizers have been isolated from thermophilic environments, such as hot springs, deep-sea hydrothermal fields, and anaerobic bioreactors. However, some thermophilic hydrogenogenic CO utilizers have been found in mesophilic environments, such as marine sediments, lake sediments, and soils. Thermophilic hydrogenogenic CO utilizers may exist in mesophilic environments as dormant cells. Although the distribution of hydrogenogenic CO utilizers in thermophilic environments has been investigated, their distribution in low-temperature environments has not been fully addressed and remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, the distribution of hydrogenogenic CO utilizers at the bottom of Lake Biwa was investigated. The sediment samples from Lake Biwa were incubated under 20% CO + 80% N2. DNA was extracted from the CO-enriched samples and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis was performed. After incubation under the addition of CO for 48 h, a decrease in CO and an increase in hydrogen (H2) were observed. This suggests that potential hydrogenogenic CO utilizers exist at the bottom of Lake Biwa. To identify potential hydrogenogenic CO utilizers, we analyzed the microbial composition at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level and conducted metagenomic analysis to survey for the key gene to utilize CO, nickel-containing CO dehydrogenase (Ni-CODH) gene. We detected the known CO utilizer ASVs and short fragments of Ni-CODH catalytic subunit-like sequence. Thus, some of these prokaryotes might contribute to CO consumption in the CO enrichment cultures and are present at the bottom of Lake Biwa.

Age-0 yellow perch were numerically dominant through most of June and as summer progressed were replaced sequentially by black crappies, freshwater drums, and Lepomis spp. By August, the pelagic community of age-0 fish was numerically dominated by Lepomis spp. This temporal succession of taxa was consistent among years. although the absolute and relative abundance of taxa differed between years. Most species were distributed across the surface of the lake early in their pelagic phase, became relatively more abundant near shore later in their pelagic phase, and then disappeared from the pelagic zone. Other published studies have demonstrated that age-0 fish migrated into the littoral zone of Lake Mendota after their pelagic residence. Variability in density of age-0 yellow perch among replicate sites within depth strata was high, with coefficients of variation ranging from 48 to 154%. The mean-to-variance relationship indicated that the age-0 yellow perch were aggregated. There were significant differences in the density of age-0 yellow perch among years but not among depth strata within years, The purse seine was our preferred gear because it has been shown to catch a wider range of sizes of age-0 fish than most other sampling gear. Therefore. we believe that the temporal and spatial patterns He describe during the pelagic life history phase of age-0 fish in Lake Mendota is more accurate than those described in other studies because our data include a better representation of the larger size-classes of age-0 fish.

J	Blewett, WL; Drzyzga, SA; Sherrod, L; Wang, H				Blewett, William L.; Drzyzga, Scott A.; Sherrod, Laura; Wang, Hong			Geomorphic relations among glacial Lake Algonquin and the Munising and Grand Marais moraines in eastern Upper Michigan, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Data obtained from ground-penetrating radar (GPR), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, and geostatistical reconstructions of Lake Algonquin water planes indicate that high-standing outwash aprons flanking the Munising moraine's southern margin in eastern Upper Michigan terminate as large, coalescing Gilbert-type ice-contact deltas graded to the Main level of Lake Algonquin. Nearly 30 km of GPR imagery provides clear evidence of topset and foreset beds diagnostic of deltaic deposition. Landform assemblages suggest that the deltas likely evolved from subaqueous grounding line fans formed along a retreating ice margin characterized by widespread stagnation. In time, these deltas aggraded to the Main lake Algonquin level as the ice margin stabilized. An OSL date of 12.5 +/- 1.1 ka on a nearby beach ridge associated with the Main Algonquin shoreline is consistent with this interpretation. These new data, coupled with the presence of nested fans at the downstream end of meltwater channels incised into the delta, indicate that Lake Algonquin was falling as delta deposition waned, eventually reaching a level concordant with the Lower Orillia level before final abandonment. Large, regionally extensive heads of outwash marking the crest of the Munising moraine are graded to the upper margins of these deltas and, by inference, must also correlate with Main Lake Algonquin and the associated Two Rivers deglaciation ca. 13-12.5 ka. The deltas, in turn, are conspicuously crosscut by outwash aprons that are graded to levels much lower than any recognized upper group Lake Algonquin shoreline. Because these aforementioned heads of outwash, part of Drexler and others' Grand Marais moraine, correlate with the Marquette moraine farther west, they likely date to the Marquette advance ca. 11.5 ka. Thus, landforms related to Two Rivers and to Marquette glaciations appear to comingle across the study area. In the absence of extensive exposures and datable materials, our work highlights the fact that crosscutting relationships and distinct differences in base level can provide an important first step for untangling the complicated landform relationships in this part of Michigan.

The Sound was divided into 32 subareas and traversed by powerboat, paralleling the shoreline, 100 to 150 m offshore. More than 10,000 birds of 14 species were identified during the study. Herring and ring-billed gulls were the most numerous species recorded (66% of total) followed by Caspian terns (14%), common terns (5%), Canada geese (5%), and black terns (4%). The number of waterbird species varied significantly among sub-areas, ranging from 2 to 13, and was greatest in Hog Bag, and Matchedash Bay. The number of waterbirds also varied significantly among sub-areas,ranging from 1.6 to 46.2 per km, and was greatest in Penetanguishene Bay, Midland Bay, Matchedash Bay, and Hog Bay. Relatively undeveloped areas with emergent vegetation and cattail marshes in Hog, Matchedash, and Sturgeon bays were major feeding and loafing areas for species less common and more ''sensitive'' to human presence such as Caspian and black terns and common moorhens. Areas along the northern shoreline associated with Roberts and Quarry islands were focal points for species such as ospreys, double-crested cormorants, and common terns. The more urban and heavily developed shoreline near the towns of Midland and Penetanguishene was heavily used by species, such as gulls, Canada geese, and mallards, which appear to be more tolerant of human activity. The conservation and protection of these natural habitat areas that are heavily used by waterbirds is an important consideration in any further shoreline development, particularly in the southern portion of the Sound.																			0380-1330						1997	23	1					27	35																WOS:A1997WZ20700003

This dataset complements earlier limnological surveys of the Canadian Arctic and provides valuable information for evaluating the vulnerability of tundra lakes to predicted climate change. Principal components analysis revealed a geographical clustering of lakes; pH, DIC, specific conductivity, and trace metal concentrations reflected major lithological differences between the mainland and Victoria Island. Clustering of mainland lakes by ecoregion was also detected. Lakes of the Queen Maud Gulf Lowland and Garry Lake Lowland ecoregions (north) differed from lakes of the Takijuq Lake Upland ecoregion (south) in depth, pH, and specific conductivity as well as nutrient, DOC, and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Ionic composition of the northern mainland lakes also indicated that the influence of marine aerosols and/or leaching of residual marine salts from post-glacial marine deposits exposed by isostatic rebound. The northern mainland lakes were the most nutrient-rich and biologically productive of the three lake clusters and were characterized by median concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen (518 mu g 1(-1)) and chlorophylla (1.6 mu g 1(-1)) that were higher than previously reported for tundra lakes in the Canadian Arctic. These lakes were chemically similar to lakes of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, in the western Canadian Arctic. Lakes of the southern mainland were dilute, acidic, and nutrient-poor, in accord with earlier limnological Surveys in this ecoregion. Concentrations of nutrients, DOC, and chlorophyll-a in Victoria Island lakes fell in the middle of the ranges reported from other islands in the Canadian Arctic. Lithologic and edaphic factors strongly influenced the limnological properties of the tundra lakes surveyed and must be controlled for in order to fully evaluate the influence of future climate and vegetation change.					; Porinchu, DF/S-4360-2019	Moser, Katrina/0000-0001-8633-5677; 													1863-9135						2009	175	2					93	112		10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0175-0093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0175-0093													WOS:000270773100001
J	PATRIQUIN, DG				PATRIQUIN, DG			BIOLOGY OF GADUS MORHUA IN OGAC LAKE A LANDLOCKED FIORD ON BAFFIN ISLAND	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Gadus morhua L. occurs in Ogac Lake, a salt, meromictic lake on Baffin Island that receives influxes of seawater only during the highest summer tides. Cod of the order of 10,000 of lengths 25 cm and greater and 500 of lengths greater than 60 cm were present. The size ranges for various ages far exceeded those of oceanic populations. Feeding conditions were poor, and sea urchins predominated in the diet. Large cod (greater than 50 cm) were highly cannibalistic, and it was estimated that they consume of the order of 3500 fish of 20-40 cm annually. Maturation occurred at the unusually large size of 85 cm in females, and at about 65 cm in males. Apparently many of the cod never reach these sizes. Spawning was from late May to early July in 1962, and initiation of spawning appeared to be related to light. The hatching of cod larvae coincided with the appearance of the nauplii of the dominant copepod in the lake. Egg size was highly variable and exhibited a curious bi-modalism. Variation in vertebral and fin-ray counts was slight in spite of high environmental variability, and thus appears largely genetically controlled. Possibly the first inhabitants came from Greenland stocks, which have high growth rates similar to the faster growing cod in the lake, and similar high length at maturity. Meristic characters also suggest affinity with Greenland rather than Labrador cod. The hydrography of the area and the possibilities of larval d or adult migration into the lake are discussed. Cannibalism must exert continuing selection for high growth rates, but very poor feeding conditions and hierarchial dominance effects probably prevent general attainment of high growth rates.																									1967	24	12					2573	+		10.1139/f67-207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-207													WOS:A1967A390800008
J	Getsinger, KD; Madsen, JD				Getsinger, Kurt D.; Madsen, John D.			Drawdown herbicide applications for control of flowering rush on dewatered littoral sites	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) is an invasive weed in shallow water and moist soil environments. It thrives in reservoirs and rivers, and is able to tolerate significant water level fluctuations. In the western United States, it is spreading along the Flathead, Clark Fork, Pend Oreille, and Columbia river systems in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy during several herbicides applied to moist soil sites of a scheduled drawdown in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho. Fifteen plots (0.1 ha) were established in the Clark Fork River delta, Lake Pend Oreille, with three replicates each of four treatments, including an nontreated reference. Herbicide treatments included imazapyr (1.68 kg ae ha(-1)) and imazamox (0.56 kg ae ha(-1)), with and without the addition of 2,4-D (1.06 kg ae ha(-1)). All applications included a nonionic surfactant at 2.8 L ha(-1). Herbicides were made by all-terrain vehicle prior to predicted rain event, and immediately following emergence of new flowering rush growth in the spring (late April). Plots were evaluated using estimated percentage of cover and biomass samples (n 1/4 10) within each plot using a 0.18-m(2) core sampler before treatment and 1 and 2 yr after treatment (YAT). Only imazapyr-treated plots had a significant reduction in rhizome bud density, but not until 2 YAT. Rhizome and root biomass were significantly reduced in plots treated with imazamox and imazapyr by years, but not by other treatments. Midsummer cover was significantly lower in imazamox-and imazapyr-treated plots at 1 YAT, but not by 2 YAT. Both imazapyr and imazamox drawdown treatments are promising approaches to control flowering rush, but treatments will likely have to be done in two or three consecutive years.																			0146-6623					JAN	2021	59						85	89																WOS:001057563700005
J	Xu, AK; Hu, MJ; Bai, QZ				Xu, Aokang; Hu, Mengjun; Bai, Qingzhu			Evolution of the Asian monsoon recorded by Holocene aeolian sediments in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Aeolian sediments in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau may contain information about changes of the atmospheric circulation changes in the region, and can be used to investigate the varying characteristics of the East Asian monsoons and the evolution of the regional environment. In this study, parameterized grain size endmember analysis is used to analyze the grain size of climate change -sensitive aeolian profiles in Zeku. Then, the environmental significance indicated by each end -members and the environmental evolution in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau since the Holocene were explored by combining magnetic susceptibility, elements and other indexes. On this basis, the factors affecting aeolian sediments under the Asian monsoon are analyzed. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The grain size components of the sediments in the ZK profile were divided into three end -members: EM1 is related to weathering and pedogenesis, and can indirectly indicate the dry and humid changes of the regional environment; Both EM2 and EM3 are near -source dust accumulations that relatively indicate the strength of regional aeolian activities. (2) The environmental evolution can be divided into the following three phases: 9.4-4.3 ka BP was a geological period with strong summer winds, a warm and humid climate, and weaker aeolian activities. 4.3-1.5 ka BP entered the westerlies control period, the climate developed to cool and dry, aeolian activities were more frequent, and there were secondary climate fluctuations in 4-2.0 ka BP and 1.7-1.5 ka BP. From 1.5 ka BP to present, the climate has become further cold and dry, and aeolian activities have intensified. (3) At the suborbital scale, the succession of sedimentary phase in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau is controlled by a combination of monsoon strength and sources changes.

J	Yue, JJ; Xiao, JL; Wang, X; Fan, JW; Qin, B				Yue, Jiaojiao; Xiao, Jule; Wang, Xu; Fan, Jiawei; Qin, Ben			Clumped isotope analysis of lacustrine endogenic carbonates and implications for paleo-temperature reconstruction: A case study from Dali Lake	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Carbonate clumped isotope (Delta(47)) is a new and reliable geothermometer. Endogenic carbonates in lake sediments are good archives to reconstruct lake water temperature using clumped isotope thermometry. However, applications of carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to lacustrine carbonates are still scarce because the existed organic and/or sulfur contaminants in such samples interfere with clumped isotope analysis and cause notable temperature biases. Therefore, exploring an effective way to remove contamination is a prerequisite to widely applying carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to lake sediments. By pretreating fine-grained endogenic carbonates from Dali lake sediments with hydrogen peroxide of different concentrations for different lengths of time, we conducted a series of conditional experiments to seek the optimal pretreatment condition for clumped isotope analysis. Delta(47), Delta(48) offset and 49 parameter were obtained from clumped isotope measurements to assess the effect of contamination removal. Results showed that untreated samples ("0%-0") had a very high 49 parameter. After the treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the 49 parameter was significantly reduced while the Delta(48) offset evidently increased. The Delta(47), Delta(48) offset and 49 parameter of samples pretreated under different conditions showed significant variability, even though the measured Delta(47) temperatures changed within a relatively narrow range (i.e., from 17.0 +/- 1.3 to 22.8 +/- 1.6 degrees C). Among various treated samples, the sample "3%-8" yielded a smaller Delta(48) offset and 49 parameter, and lower Delta(47) temperature of 17.0 +/- 1.3 degrees C. Therefore, "reacting with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 8 h" was suggested to be the optimal condition for removing contaminants from lacustrine endogenic carbonates prior to clumped isotope analysis. At the time when the pretreatment condition was too intense (i.e., H2O2 concentration >3% and/or reaction time >8 h), secondary contaminants might have been generated in the closed reaction system, whose ultimately transformed state may interfere with masses 47, 48. Using the optimal pretreatment procedure, we obtained reasonable Delta(47) temperature changes during the last deglaciation and found a temperature decrease of about 6 degrees C in Northern China during the Younger Dryas period. Our study demonstrates a great potential of applying carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to lacustrine carbonates for paleo-temperature and paleo-elevation reconstructions in the future.																			1674-7313	1869-1897				FEB	2021	64	2					294	306		10.1007/s11430-020-9697-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-020-9697-9		JAN 2021											WOS:000608667900001
J	Griswold, RG; Kohler, AE; Taki, D				Griswold, Robert G.; Kohler, Andre E.; Taki, Doug			Survival of Endangered Snake River Sockeye Salmon Smolts from Three Idaho Lakes: Relationships with Parr Size at Release, Parr Growth Rate, Smolt Size, Discharge, and Travel Time	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In 1991, Snake River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were listed as endangered. The Sawtooth Valley Project was initiated to conserve and rebuild sockeye salmon populations that historically spawned and reared in five Sawtooth Valley lakes designated as critical habitat in central Idaho. We evaluated smolt survival of sockeye salmon that were stocked as parr into Redfish, Pettit, and Alturas lakes. Smolt travel time, residuals of Salmon River discharge and smolt travel time, and specific growth rate of parr explained 58% of the variation in smolt survival in a multiple-regression model. Smolt survival was inversely related to smolt travel time, and travel time was negatively correlated with mean May discharge in the Salmon River at Salmon, Idaho. We were particularly interested in the relationships between smolt survival and parr size at release, smolt size at migration, and parr growth rate. Smolt survival from nursery lakes to Lower Granite Dam was negatively correlated with mean parr size at release and mean smolt size at emigration. Smaller parr and smolts survived better. Smolt survival to the dam was correlated with parr growth rates in the three lakes combined; the relationship was nonlinear. Smolt survival increased as specific growth rate increased up to 0.06% per day, but further increases in growth rate were associated with reductions in survival. Absolute growth rates of parr were negatively related to parr weight at release. Smaller individuals grew faster than larger individuals, apparently as a result of size-dependent metabolic demand and prey availability. The relationships between smolt survival and parr size, smolt size, and parr growth rate differed among lakes. These data suggest that successful migrants must at least maintain weight during the winter preceding migration and that the stocking of smaller parr with lower metabolic demand may be preferable to stocking larger parr when forage is limited.

The VR simulation was developed as a part of a virtual 3D lab for an undergraduate hydrology and hydraulics class and lets students experience and interact with an immersive recreation of various stages of flooding as it appeared on site over the course of multiple days during the 2009 flood. The tool enables students to visualize the inundation with stage increase and can extract multiple parameters while studying the flood wave propagation. The simulation integrated multiple types of data and visuals to create a realistic and engaging learning experience. 360-degree 3D video footage was captured on-site at a bridge crossing on a low flow day. This was combined with animated 3D models showing water flow and debris in the river. The water level and flow rate was controlled by historic measurement data recorded during the flood. Students control a time slider to advance through the flood event and experience the water levels rising around and submerging them. Students can explore different locations and elevations under and around the bridge as well as see the effect of Manning's n on the flood stage and flow rate. Flood wave propagation was modeled using HEC RAS model and calibrated using field data. Unity 3D was used to combine and control the 360-degree video and 3D model behavior. The simulation was deployed to the Meta Quest 2 VR headset and successfully implemented in a hydrology and hydraulics lab during spring 2023.																					978-0-7844-8547-7				2024							772	776																WOS:001229341100068
J	Zinoviev, VP				Zinoviev, Vasily P.			THE WORK YEAR IN THE MOUNTAIN MINES OF SIBERIA IN LATE 19TH - EARLY 20TH CENTURIES	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												One of the fundamental problems of the economic situation of wage workers is working time. Eight-hour working day was considered as a radical improvement of working conditions. The reduction of working time had always been one of the main demands of proletariat. In turn, industrialists aspired to get the most surplus value by the lengthening of working time. In the works on the history of working class studying the issue of working time is traditionally paid close attention to (monographs by E.E. Cruze, Yu.I. Kiryanov, etc.). The development of issue of working time requires detailed and systematic statistical material. The researchers of the economic situation of workers in Siberia use the materials of mining inspectorate. This paper deals with the dynamics and the structure of the work year of the miners in Siberia in late 19th - early 20th centuries based on the official departmental reports. The feature of Siberian mines was seasonality. Metal and salt production plants (with a break for the last repair), gold and silver-lead mines, coal mines, some large quarries for extraction of limestone worked all the year round. Most of the mines, small mines and quarries, and salt lakes were developed seasonally, usually in the summer. The average work duration of the mines was low and amounted to half a year. However, dividing the company by the duration of the working season and the number of workers, one can make a conclusion that a group of mines, working over 270 days a year amounted to 67.2% of all workers in 19151917, and mines equipped with dredges - 73.4% of all workers. The reduction of seasonality created the conditions to form the permanent body of workers. Operating mines in Siberia with the annual cycle of work (317 days) in the late 19th - early 20th centuries usually worked 305 days, missed 3 days, had 9 sick days. In July 1914, according to enterprise management responses to the questionnaires by the Mining Department, the company worked 24.1 days, the workers - 21.1 days, the main professions (cutters, drillers, dredgers) - 20.5 days. Before World War I the workers of coal mines of Siberia had 3.3 days less at work per month than the miners of Donbass, in 1916 it was one day less. The workers of gold mining companies worked more days per year than the workers in other industries in the country, the former worked about 284 days, the latter - 260-275 days. Consequently, the glitter of gold urged the gold miners and the workers, but on the whole the Siberian miners lived by the same rules as the miners throughout Russia. Seasonality of production declined, norms and traditions of relationships of workers and employers were established.

Tillage Effects on Soil Properties and Spatial Variability in Two Mississippi Delta Watersheds	SOIL SCIENCE												This study evaluated changes in soil properties several years after implementation of conservation measures. Two approximately 50-ha fields within two Mississippi Delta oxbow lake watersheds (Deep Hollow and Beasley) were laid out in 60-m grids. Soil from a tilled cotton field in Deep Hollow watershed was sampled at each node in 1996 and again in 2000 after 4 years of reduced tillage cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crops; soil also was collected from conventional tillage cotton in Beasley Lake watershed in 1996 and again in 2006 from the same grid nodes after 4 years of reduced tillage cotton and 5 years of reduced tillage soybeans. Organic matter levels in the soil surface were higher in both watersheds after conservation tillage was implemented, likely caused by increased plant residue accumulation and limited soil mixing. Higher soil P levels in both watersheds under conservation management were attributed to less distribution in soil because of reduced tillage, Lower NO3-N in Deep Hollow in 2000 suggested N immobilization in the soil surface. Nitrogen was not analyzed for Beasley soil samples. Soil pH values were also higher in the later samplings for both watersheds, but because lime was applied in the interim, it is difficult to ascribe an effect from tillage. Potassium, calcium, and magnesium were higher in 2000 after the 4-year reduced tillage practice in the Deep Hollow watershed. However, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were lower in 2006 than in 1996 at the Beasley Lake watershed because no fertilizer was applied to the field since 2001. Regardless of tillage system, relatively high P levels in soils from both watersheds are indicative of high native soil P levels in the Mississippi Delta soils. Similar to other studies, water-soluble P was positively correlated with Mehlich III P. Spatial relationships of P examined using kriging showed that P data were spatially dependent, and their spatial dependence was impacted by tillage practices.

J	HSIAO, SC				HSIAO, SC			A LIMNOLOGICAL STUDY OF ERH HAI .2. BIOLOGICAL FEATURES	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The total quantity of tow-net plankton from Lake Erh Hai shows 2 maxima: one occurs between Nov. and Dec, and the other,Mar. and Apr. The 1st is associated with a fall in the mean temp, of the water and the 2d with the end of the dry season. There is a pronounced minimum in Aug. and a less striking one in Feb. The relation between total plankton quantity and the effect of water temp., weather conditions and cultural interference is discussed. Quantitatively the most prominent zooplankters are Cladocera and Copepoda. Among the former, 4 spp. of Daphnidae, 1 sp. of Bosminidae, 9 spp. of Chydoridae and 1 sp. of Leptodoridae are found. Two spp. of Diaptomidae, 3 of Cyclopidae and 1 of Argulidae are found among the Copepoda. The most common spp. occurring during the plankton maxima are Leptodora kindtii Daphnia longispina Tropodiaptomus hebereroides, Arctodiaptomus hsichowensis and the immature stages of cyclops and diaptomids. The most abundant phytoplankters are Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Diplocystis aeruginosa which form the bulk of "Myxophyceae bloom." There are 2 spp. each of Coscinodiscaceae, Achnanthaceae and Cymbellaceae. There is a paucity in the number of spp. and individuals of each species of diatoms in the open water. Each ml. of settled zooplankton contains 105.8 mg. of wet matter of which 91.2% consists of water. About 9.1 mg. of dry matter is found in each ml. of settled zooplankton. On the avg. 9.8% of dry zooplankton is N, giving a "crude protein" value of 61.2%; 17.9% is lipid and the rest "crude carbohydrate." Phytoplankton contains 89.8% water and each ml. of settled material contains 24.9 mg. dry matter, of which 42.7% is "crude protein," 6.9%, lipid, and 50.3% "crude carbohydrate." These values from chemical analyses have been compared with those found by Birge and Juday in Wisconsin lakes. Among the macrofauna the most common forms are 2 spp. of viviparid, 3 species of hydrobiid (or pleuro-ceratid) gastropods and 1 sp. of corbiculid lamellibranch. The snail Margarya melanoides is economically important and externally resembles the thalassoid Tanganyikan Melaniidae. The most valuable fishes are Cyprinus carpio. Carassius auratus and Schizothorax taliensis. A list of aquatic plants is given. Of these plants Xvstrobolus yunnanensis is used as food while all the rest are used for fertilizing the fields about the lake. Lake sediments show very low organic content with few remains of diatoms and invertebrates. Mechanical and chemical analyses of the cores indicate 2 probable dry periods when the sediments at the 56- and 100-cm. layers below the present bottom of the lake were deposited, with a zone formed during wetter period between them.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1949	18	1					89	99		10.2307/1583	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1583													WOS:A1949XX15200006
J	Sawi, T; Holtzman, B; Walter, F; Paisley, J				Sawi, T.; Holtzman, Ben; Walter, Fabian; Paisley, John			An Unsupervised Machine-Learning Approach to Understanding Seismicity at an Alpine Glacier	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												It is critical to understand the dynamic conditions of Earth's cryosphere, yet the subglacial and englacial environments that control many aspects of ice behavior are inherently difficult to observe. The study of seismicity in glaciers and ice sheets has provided valuable insights about the cryosphere for decades, more recently aided by tools from machine learning. Here, we present an unsupervised machine-learning approach to discovering and interpreting cryoseismic patterns using 5 weeks of seismic data recorded at Gornergletscher, Switzerland. Our algorithm utilizes non-negative matrix factorization and hidden Markov modeling to reduce spectrograms into characteristic, low-dimensional "fingerprints," which we reduce further using principal component analysis, then cluster using k-means clustering. We investigate the timing, locations, and statistical properties of the clusters in relation to temperature, GPS and lake-level measurements, and find that signals associated with lake flooding tend to occupy one cluster, whereas signals associated with afternoon and evening melt-water flow reside in others. We suggest that the one cluster contains signals that include the true initiation of the flood's englacial and subglacial drainage components. This work demonstrates an unsupervised machine-learning approach to exploring both continuous and event-based glacial seismic data. Plain Language Summary Earth's climate change poses extreme risks for the stability of glaciers and ice sheets. One such glacier, Gornergletscher in the Swiss Alps, has been monitored for decades, along with a lake on the glacier which from the 1950s until recently filled and drainedevery summer, releasing huge amounts of water under, through, and on top of the glacier. To study this glacier, which is hundreds of meters thick, and its lake, scientists employ "cryoseismology," the study of seismic excitations in the ice. In our study, we use unsupervised machine-learning, a type of artificial intelligence that identifies patterns in large data sets, to organize 5 weeks of cryoseismic records into clusters composed of similar types of signals. Although the machine-learning algorithm has no knowledge of glacial hydrology nor its evolution over time, the output places the signals associated with the beginning of lake flooding in one cluster, and signals associated with afternoon and evening melt-water flow in others. We also find that "icequakes" are clustered based on extremely subtle, similar, vibrations. From these findings, we provide an improved chronology for the glacial lake flood, and a better understanding of the cryoseismic signals caused by water flowing underneath and through glaciers.

The uppermost mixolimnion was oxic, with low salinity (3-5%). The lower chemocline layer was brown-green colored, with very high content of particulate organic matter (up to 11.8 mg C L-1). The lowermost monimolimnion had marine salinity (22-24%) and very high concentrations of sulfide (up to 18 mmol L-1) and CH4(up to 1.8 mmol L-1). In the chemocline, total microbial abundance and the rate of anoxygenic photosynthesis were 8.8 x 10(6)cells mL(-1)and 34.4 mu mol C L(-1)day(-1), respectively. Both in March and September, sulfate reduction rate increased with depth, peaking (up to 0.6-1.1 mu mol S L(-1)day(-1)) in the lower chemocline. Methane oxidation rates in the chemocline were up to 85 and 180 nmol CH(4)L(-1)day(-1)in March and September, respectively; stimulation of this process by light was observed in September. The percentages of cyanobacteria and methanotrophs in the layer where light-induced methane oxidation occurred were similar, similar to 2.5% of the microbial community. Light did not stimulate methane oxidation in deeper layers. The carbon isotope composition of particulate organic matter (delta C-13-Corg), dissolved carbonates (delta C-13-DIC), and methane (delta C-13- CH4) indicated high microbial activity in the chemocline. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed predominance of Cyanobium cyanobacteria (order Synechococcales) in the mixolimnion. Green sulfur bacteriaChlorobium phaeovibrioidescapable of anoxygenic photosynthesis constituted similar to 20% of the chemocline community both in March and in September.Methyloprofundus gammaptoteobacteria(family Methylomonaceae) were present in the upper chemocline, where active methane oxidation occurred. During winter, cyanobacteria were less abundant in the chemocline, while methanotrophs occurred in higher horizons, including the under-ice layer. Chemolithotrophic gammaproteobacteria of the genus Thiomicrorhabdus, oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds at low oxygen concentrations, were revealed in the chemocline in March. Both in March and September archaea constituted up to 50% of all microorganisms in the hypolimnion. The percentage of putative methanogens in the archaeal community was low, and they occurred mainly in near-bottom horizons.

Sediments of two Pleistocene water bodies are exposed at the site. The first one is an archaeologically sterile, light-colored limnic carbonate with an Early Pleistocene age. It contains an ostracod fauna assemblage dominated by Candona neglecta, Candonopsis kingsleii, and Pseudocandona sp., and, in minor abundances, Cypria ophtalmica, Cyprideis sp., Humphcypris sp., Fabaeformiscandona cf. fabaeformis and Ilyocypris sp. These sediments were deposited in a shallow, freshwater to oligohaline lake under stable conditions. Sediments of the second water body are silty and dark-colored with a depositional age of 65 ka, belonging to the Late Pleistocene Ashmura Formation. The unit covers a geologically complex topography of tectonically uplifted limnic deposits and a hill-like gravel bar at the site. The most important archaeological layer is situated at its base, containing a lithic assemblage ascribed primarily to the Middle Palaeolithic Mousterian tradition and very well preserved flora and fauna. In the sediments from the archaeological layers, the brackish water ostracod Cyprideis torosa and the foraminifer Ammonia tepida could be identified. In sediments of the Ashmura Formation taken near the site, C. neglecta, Candona angulata, Ilyogpris sp., C kingsleii, Pseudocandona sp., C ophtalmica, Darwinula stevensoni, Trajancypris sp. and Potamogpris smaragdina were found, indicating a freshwater to slightly oligohaline stagnant water body. The ostracod fauna of the NMO site, together with geochemical data, allow us to reconstruct a depositional environment of the margin at a shallow lake with brackish or saline springs nearby during the site's occupation by Middle Palaeolithic humans. Additionally, Candona weltneri, Candona cf. meerfeldiana, C kingsleii, Cyclocypris laevis, C ophtalmica, Cyprideis sp., Fabaeformiscandona cf. fabaeformis, P. smaragdina, Pseudocandona depressa, Trajancypris sp, Zonocypris cf. costata and A. tepida could be recorded for the first time for the Pleistocene limnic strata of the Hula Basin.

Lithofacies features indicate that the studied materials were generated in an alluvial-dominated setting, with a channeled area fringed by floodplain zones. During high water levels and high-energy floods, gravels and sands deposited in the active area and in lateral overbank areas. In these lateral areas, mud settling took place when flood decreased and then anoxic conditions could be reached due to microbial oxidation of organic matter and the low permeability of the marly sediment. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of 32 samples and microtextural observation of 10 samples by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) revealed the occurrence of Fe oxi-hydroxides microspheres showing different surficial structure. These microspheres are pseudomorphs after pyrite framboids although the formation of some primary Fe oxy-hydroxides aggregates cannot be rejected. Pyrite framboids genesis in sediments underlying oxic-dysoxic water column would have been favored by anoxic conditions reached in lateral overbank areas after main flooding, involving the activity of Fe reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), given the high SOT availability provided by the highly mineralized groundwater from the upstream Bathos de Arifio spring. Subsequent change to oxic conditions during the exposition of the floodplain enhanced the transformation of pyrite into Fe oxy-hydroxides, as well as in microenvironments around cracks and roots. Pyrite oxidation likely took place with the implication of neutrophilic iron oxidizing Bacteria and Archaea living in microaerophilic conditions, as well as cyanobacteria, given the close association of Fe oxides framboids with microbial features. In addition, pyrite and/or Fe oxi-hydroxides framboids from marl levels could have been incorporated to sand sediments during further overbank flooding episodes. Under these new oxic conditions pyrite oxidation would have been favored and even the formation of primary Fe oxy-hydroxides. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Emergent mayflies (subimagoes and imagoes) were collected in 1988 at 34 sites (25 navigation pools), extending 1260 km from Little Falls, Minnesota, downstream to St. Louis, Missouri. Cadmium concentrations in composite samples of whole mayflies ranged from 7 to 219 ng/g dry weight in females and from <7 to 265 ng/g in males. Cadmium concentrations were highest (greater-than-or-equal-to 150 ng/g) in samples from Pools 2 and 3 (downstream from the Twin Cities metropolitan area), 15 (near the Quad Cities metropolitan area), and 27 (near the St. Louis metropolitan area). Cadmium concentrations in female mayflies decreased significantly with distance downstream from Pool 2 at river mile 825 to Pool 9 at river mile 648, paralleling spatial trends in the cadmium contamination of sediments in the reach downstream from the Twin Cities metropolitan area, reported in earlier studies; cadmium burdens in mayflies followed a similar spatial trend. Concentrations of mercury were much less variable, ranging from 44 to 102 ng/g dry weight in female mayflies and from 60 to 177 ng/g in males; concentrations and burdens were highest in mayflies collected at Pools 2, 20, 22, 25, and 27. Mercury concentrations in females decreased significantly with distance downstream from Pool 2 at river mile 825 to Pool 5A at river mile 728.5. Concentrations of mercury and cadmium in composite samples of female mayflies were not correlated, indicating dissimilar longitudinal patterns in concentrations of the two metals. Concentrations and burdens of both metals varied significantly between males and females; consequently, we recommend that programs involving analyses of mayflies to survey or monitor metals in aquatic systems analyze separately males and females.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	1992	23	1					109	116											1637190					WOS:A1992HY12700016

JORDAN RIVER AND DEAD SEA BASIN: COOPERATION AMID CONFLICT	NATO Science for Peace and Security Series C-Environmental Security				NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Water Resources and Infrastructure in Areas of Conflict and Extreme Conditions	NOV, 2007	Masada Ein Gedi, ISRAEL	NATO				In the past, the Dead Sea's level fluctuated due to natural climatic changes. Today, however, the Dead Sea water balance is depleted by similar to 90%, mainly as a result of human intervention. The Jordan River, known globally for its historic value and once the Dead Sea's major water supplier, has been reduced to a poor sewage stream. The situation is a clear reflection of the regional potable water shortage. Over the past 78 years, this depletion has caused a 32 m drop in the lake's level, occurring at accelerating rate that exceeded 1 m/year on the average for last decade. Furthermore, he level's fall accompanied by environmental deterioration, including damages to the infrastructure, tourism, agriculture and ecosystems. The riparian parties of the Dead Sea have agreed to investigate the RSDSC (Red Sea-Dead Sea conduit) plan as a potential solution to stop the deterioration and to increase the potable water supply in the area. The World Bank is financing a 2-year feasibility study for the project, which is much too short a period to conduct sufficient research that bridges knowledge gaps, especially with regard to the environmental implications. A systemic approach that involves reviving the Jordan River Dead Sea system is free of the various environmental threats involved in the RSDSC has not yet been fully considered. It is therefore offered herein for simultaneous feasibility study.

FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Similar carbonate fabrics may result from different pathways of precipitation and diagenetic replacement. Distinguishing the underlying mechanisms leading to a given carbonate fabric is relevant, both in terms of an environmental and diagenetic interpretation. Prominent among carbonate fabrics are aragonite botryoids and spherulites, typically interpreted as direct seawater precipitates and used as proxies for fluid properties and depositional environments. This study investigated mu m to mm-scale Holocene botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite from marine and non-marine carbonate settings associated with microbial mats, and reports two distinct formation mechanisms: 1) early diagenetic replacement, and 2) primary precipitation via nanocrystal aggregation. In the intertidal microbial mats of Khawr Qantur (Abu Dhabi), botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite are replacement products of heavily micritized bioclasts. To form the botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite, skeletal rods and needles, resulting from disintegration of micritized bioclasts, recrystallize into nanocrystals during early marine diagenesis. These nanocrystals then grow into fibrous crystals, forming botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite. In the lacustrine microbial bioherms of the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (United States) and in the hydrothermal travertines of Bagni San Filippo (Italy), botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite evolve from nanocrystals via precipitation. The nanocrystals are closely associated with extracellular polymeric substances in microbial biofilms and aggregate to form fibrous crystals of botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite. The studied fabrics form a portion of the bulk sediment and show differences in terms of their formation processes and petrological features compared to the often larger (few mm to over 1 m) botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite described from open-marine reefal cavities. Features shown here may represent modern analogues for ancient examples of carbonate depositional environments associated with microbialites. The implication of this research is that botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite associated with microbial mats are relevant in paleoenvironmental interpretations, but must be combined with a detailed evaluation of their formation process. Care must be taken as the term "botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite" may in fact include, from the viewpoint of their nucleation and formation mechanism, similar fabrics originated from different pathways. At present, it seems unclear to which degree the mu m to mm-scale botryoids and spherulites described here are comparable to their cm-to dm-size counterparts precipitated as cements in the open pore space of reefal environments. However, it is clear that the investigation of ancient botryoidal and spherulitic aragonite must consider the possibility of an early diagenetic replacement origin of these precipitates.

However, abandonment has diminished their multifunctionality. Although some abandoned paddies/ponds function as natural wetlands, their hydrological/environmental characteristics are highly variable.ObjectivesWe explored whether harnessing these abandoned sites as nature-based solutions (NbS) can offer substantial opportunities for restoring ecosystem services and biodiversity, and identified key factors to enhance their multifunctionality.MethodsWe surveyed 61 abandoned paddies/ponds in the Lake Kasumigaura watershed, Japan, and quantified six ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators: water purification, water storage, methane (CH4) regulation, damselfly richness, native fish richness, and resistance to invasive by exotic fishes. We examined tradeoffs/synergies among these indicators using principal component analysis.ResultsPrincipal component 1 revealed positive relationships among water purification, water storage, and damselfly richness. The strength of these synergies depended on the type of water flow: non-channelized flow abandoned paddies/ponds exhibited higher synergies. Sites with stronger synergies tended to be less resistant to exotic fish invasion. Principal component 2 and principal component 3 represented CH4 regulation and native fish richness, respectively, both of which were independent. CH4 regulation decreased with lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, while native fish richness increased at sites with diverse vegetation types.ConclusionsOur results highlighted the potential of abandoned paddies/ponds as multifunctional restoration tools in agricultural landscapes and suggested their effectiveness because NbS can be enhanced by managing hydrological/environmental factors.

The present study investigates ostracods across 43 sites in eastern Yunnan, including desiccated rice fields, ditches, rivers, ponds, vegetable fields, karstic cave, spring, and stream. A total of 483 living ostracod individuals were collected from 15 out of the 43 sampling sites, encompassing eleven species predominantly from the Cyprididae family, accompanied by species from the Candonidae, Cyclocyprididae and Ilyocyprididae families. Our results of culturing experiments with dried muds indicated survival of dormant ostracods, as an important strategy of recolonizing non-permanent water bodies after dry phases. Thus, recolonization is realized through an 'ostracod bank', not only an egg bank. Significant differences in species composition were observed across regions, reflecting the dynamic responses of ostracods to agricultural practices and environment. Furthermore, documented elevational distributions of some species could be extended based on our study areas in an elevation of 887-2064 m asl. The study also documents three species new to Yunnan, increasing the number of known recent non-marine ostracod species in this province to 33. The newly recorded species are Stenocypris hirutai Smith and Kamiya (Hydrobiologia 559: 331-355, 2006), Stenocypris viridis Okubo, 1990 and Hemicypris ovata Sars, 1903. These findings provide insights into ostracod ecology, biogeography, and aquatic ecology, revealing adaptive and resilient mechanisms of ostracods in temporary, eutrophic habitats.					; peng, ancheng/JJF-7868-2023; Schmitz, Olga/ACA-9547-2022; Frenzel, Peter/F-5247-2012	Schmitz, Olga/0000-0003-2644-6580; peng, ancheng/0000-0002-3813-1802													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2025	59	2					541	559		10.1007/s10452-025-10179-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-025-10179-w		MAR 2025											WOS:001437488700001

Cells of strain Z-1701(T) were short, straight, motile Gram-stain-positive rods. Growth of Z-1701(T) obligately depended on the presence of sodium carbonate. Strain Z-1701(T) could utilize various peptides mixtures, such as beef and yeast extracts, peptone, soytone, trypticase and tryptone, as well as such proteins as albumin, gelatin and sodium caseinate. It was able to grow oligotrophically with 0.02g l(-1) yeast extract as the sole energy and carbon source. Carbohydrates did not support the growth of strain Z-1701(T). The main products released during the growth of strain Z-1701(T) on tryptone were formate, acetate and ammonium. Strain Z-1701(T) was able to reduce ferrihydrite, Fe(III)-EDTA, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate and elemental sulfur, using proteinaceous substrates as electron donors. In all cases the presence of the electron acceptor in the medium stimulated growth. The main cellular fatty acids were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-15:0 aldehyde, iso-Z(15:1) omega b, C-16:0, iso-C-17:0 aldehyde, C-16:0 aldehyde and C-14:0. The DNA G+C content of the isolate was 43.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated alignment of 120 protein-marker sequences revealed that strain Z-1701(T) falls into a cluster with the genus Tindallia, family Clostridiaceae. 16S rRNA gene sequence identity between strain Z-1701(T) and Tindallia species were 88.3-89.75%. On the basis of its phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic position, the novel isolate is considered to be a representative of a novel genus and species for which the name Isachenkonia alkalipeptolytica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, with Z-1701(T) (=JCM 32929(T)=DSM 109060(T)=VKM B-3261(T)) as its type strain.

B	Sánchez-Carrillo, S		SanchezCarrillo, S; AlvarezCobelas, M		Sanchez-Carrillo, Salvador			Hydrology and hydrogeology	LIMNOLOGIA DE LA LAGUNA DE SOMOLINOS (GUADALAJARA): SINTESIS DEL CONOCIMIENTO CIENTIFICO	Biblioteca de Ciencias											the watershed of the Laguna de Somolinos (755 ha), located at the headwater of Bornova river (a tributary of the Henares river in the Tagus River Basin) has a dense drainage network, with rectangular to dendritic pattern flowing North-South and EastWest. The mainstream channel has a very low slope as a consequence of fluvial embedding. The lake lies on the aquifer Cabecera del Bornova (128 km2), which is included within the large aquifer Almazan Sur, located mostly in the Duero River basin. This is an unexploited aquifer for which there is little hydrogeologic knowledge. Almazan Sur aquifer has a thickness up than 1,100 m of Mesozoic limestones covered by Tertiary detrital material. From June 2013 to June 2014 a hydrological study was carried out in the Laguna de Somolinos. Monthly average instantaneous discharges into and out of the laguna were 148.79 +/- 22.55 l/s at the inflow in the Manadero river, 13.88 +/- 6.16 and 12.94 +/- 5.74 l/s in East and West spring inflows, respectively, and 227.27 +/- 71.27 l/s at the lake outlet. The monthly water balance of Laguna de Somolinos for the study period was strongly biased by surface water flows, being both rain and evapotranspiration negligible. The water flowing monthly through the lake ranged 313-968 106 m3 but water storage changed very little. The inflow by the Manadero river represented at an annual scale 65% of total inflows, while direct discharges from the aquifer accounted 23%. Our results, very different from other previous estimates, are the first to show the hydrological functioning of the Laguna de Somolinos.																					978-84-00-10443-6; 978-84-00-10442-9				2018	46						55	68																WOS:000637015500005

Gas and water geochemistry of geothermal systems in Dominica, Lesser Antilles island arc	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Four of the nine potentially active volcanoes on the island of Dominica in the Lesser Antilles volcanic island arc have associated active volcanic-hydrothermal systems. Between 2000 and 2006 the gas and thermal waters from these systems were investigated to geochemically characterise the fluids, gain insight into the temperature and equilibrium state of the underlying reservoirs, and evaluate the feasibility of monitoring geothermal features as a volcano surveillance tool in Dominica. The geothermal gases are typical of those found in arc-type settings, with N-2 excess and low amounts of He and Ar. The dry gas is dominated by CO2 (ranging from 492 to 993 mmol/mol), and has a hydrothermal signature with hydrogen sulphide as the main sulphurous gas. The waters are predominantly acid-sulphate (SO4 = 100-4200 mg/L, pH <= 4), and likely formed as a result of dilution of acidic gases in near surface oxygenated groundwater. Enrichment in both delta O-18 and delta D with respect to the global meteoric water line (GMWL) confirms that the waters are of primarily meteoric origin, but have been affected by evaporation processes. Quartz geothermometers gave equilibrium temperatures of 83 degrees C-203 degrees C. These temperatures contrast with the higher equilibrium temperature ranges (170 degrees C-350 degrees C) obtained for the gases using the H-2/Ar*-CH4/CO2 gas ratios plot, suggesting that the quartz geothermometers are affected by non-attainment of equilibrium. This may be a result of precipitation of the dissolved silica and/or dilution by relatively cold shallow aquifers of the thermal fluids. Generally, no significant variations in fluid gas chemistry of the hydrothermal systems were observed during the study period, and we propose that there were no changes in the state of volcanic activity in this period. One exception to this occurred in a feature known as the Boiling Lake, which underwent a month-long period of significant compositional, temperature and water level fluctuations ascribed to a drastic decrease of hydrothermal input related to a perturbation in the lake (probably seismically induced). This geochemical study is part of an ongoing monitoring programme of Dominica geothermal systems, aimed at establishing long-term geochemical observations for the purpose of volcano monitoring.

J	Barnekow, L				Barnekow, L			Holocene regional and local vegetation history and lake-level changes in the Tornetrask area, northern Sweden	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A combination of pollen and macrofossil analyses from six lakes at altitudes between 370 and 999 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in the Tornetrask area reflect the Holocene vegetation history. The main field study area has been the Abisko valley at altitudes around 400 m a.s.l. The largest lake, Vuolep Njakajaure has annually laminated (varved) sediments. The chronology and sedimentation rates in the pollen-influx calculations are based on varve yrs in this lake and on radiocarbon dated terrestrial plant macrofossils in the other lakes. A strong increase of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa) during the early Holocene with a tree-line c. 300 m above the present, indicates that the summer temperature was c. 1.5 degrees C higher than today, assuming that the land uplift has been 100 m since then. Scattered stands of pine (Pinus sylvestris) may have been growing in the area immediately after the deglaciation but a forest consisting of pine and mountain birch expanded first at low elevations and reached the eastern parts of the Tornetrask area at c. 8300 cal BP and the western parts at c. 7600 cal BP. The highest pine-birch forest limit was not reached until 6300 cal BP (110 m above present pine limit). Warm and dry conditions during the pine forest maximum led to lowering of the water level documented in Lake Badsjon in the Abisko valley about 1-1.5 m lower than today. Pine and mountain birch were growing at the maximum altitude until c. 4500 cal BP. Assuming that land uplift has been in the range of 20-40 m since the mid-Holocene, this implies that the temperature was then c. 1.5-2 degrees C higher than today. Rising lake-levels and lowering limits of pine and mountain birch since c. 4500 cal BP indicate a more humid and cool climate during the late Holocene.																			0921-2728					APR	2000	23	4					399	420		10.1023/A:1008171418429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008171418429													WOS:000087069200005

Freshwater fishes perform high levels of phenotypic plasticity thus these rates may differ widely between populations and temporally within a population. Knowledge of their ranges enables understanding the scope of population persistence and predicting the effects of environmental stressors. Time series of vendace (Coregonus albula) catch samples from 22 lakes were applied to estimate the lake-specific average length-at-age and survival in mature age groups (mS). Assuming an age-at-maturity of 2 yr and a constant length-fecundity relationship, survival from spawning to age 1 (firstS) and 2 (premS, prematurity survival) were estimated using a life table assuming a stable state. The average length at age 2 yr (L2) varied two-fold between populations, <100 - > 200 mm, and the estimated fecundity approximately eight-fold. Also, mS varied considerably, <10-70%a(-1). L2 and mS were positively associated. The premS estimate varied similar to 30-fold among lakes, <0.01 - > 0.2% per 2 yr, being highest in populations with low L2 and fecundity combined with low mS. The range of firstS estimate was even higher, 0.01-2%. This high between-lake variability seems to occur especially after hatching during the first summer. Its level is set by the factors external to the population, e.g., the abundance of key predators. Persistence with low early life survival is possible because of the wide scope of compensation in the size- and fecundity-at-age and mS. Early life survival is expected to decrease due to climate change while the compensation has its limits, increasing the risk of local extinctions.

Sediment cores and outcrops were used to recognise three deposit types, noting how some differ from lahars, through sedimentological and stratigraphic analysis: (1) thick, laterally discontinuous, pumice-dominated deposits occur overlying alluvial plain and lower terrace surfaces across both watersheds; (2) chaotic, extremely poorly sorted and matrix-supported beds composed of both epiclastic and pyroclastic material occur as two conspicuous deposits at Las Piedritas outcrops, in a low-gradient confined channel setting; and (3) layers with an exclusively pyroclastic composition and no flow sedimentary structures or fragment roundness were found draping each of the two chaotic intervals and intercalating with the background sediment in Las Piedritas prodelta. Thick pumice packages capping the floodplains resulted from the overflow of streams carrying a floating pumice load. Due to its positive buoyancy, the pumice is transported as a slowly moving overlying mantle without mixing with the streamflow. The disorganised pattern and poor sorting of the matrix-rich polymictic beds are consistent with laminar, gravity-driven, high-concentration flows. They constitute secondary lahars, originating upstream from large run-off processes that reworked a pyroclastic substrate. The lack of reworking features in the vitric-rich units identified in the lake core retrieved from Las Piedritas prodelta, as well as the continuous and widespread occurrences of those interbedded in upstream outcrops, indicate an airfall origin. No reworked tephra unit is recognised in the prodelta sediment record, although various deposits from the hydrologic remobilisation of airfall tephra are found along the subaerial portion of both watersheds. Apparently, large amounts of flotation-remobilised tephra were retained on the delta plain, while another considerable fraction would have been carried away from the creek mouth under the influence of dominant regional winds.

J	Stober, I; Zhong, J; Bucher, K				Stober, I.; Zhong, J.; Bucher, K.			From freshwater inflows to salt lakes and salt deposits in the Qaidam Basin, W China	SWISS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Qaidam basin in W China is an immense hyperarid intramontane basin with flat vast playas and salt lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The central basin is about 2800-2900 m a.s.l. elevation and enclosed by mountain ranges reaching > 5800 m in the Qilian Mountains and > 6200 m in the eastern Kunlun Mountains. The extensive playas of the basin are covered by gypsum or halite with very subordinate additional solids. In this contribution we report on the chemical composition of salt lakes and inflows to the Qaidam basin (analysis of 30 water samples collected in the summer of 2008 and 2009) together with the composition of 22 salt samples. Salt lakes and small salt ponds formed at topographic depressions. Some of the lakes cover > 300 km(2) surface but are very shallow (1-2 m deep). Most salt lakes and salt ponds are NaCl dominated and contain typically 250-300 g kg(-1) total dissolved solids (TDS). Some lakes are industrially used and produce KCl fertilizer, LiCl, and boron or are strongly modified by deep water produced in oil fields. Lakes along the borders to the high mountains are typically not fully saturated with halite. However, also these lakes lost most Ca and are drastically enriched in Mg and some lakes also in B and Li. The chemical development of the most natural salt lakes follows a path producing Ca-deficient water that ultimately precipitate Mg-bearing carbonates and chlorites in addition to halite upon evaporation. The salt lakes form by continuous and drastic evaporation of the waters supplied by the inflows to the lakes in the basin. All inflows carry considerable amounts of Cl and are characterized by very high Cl/Br ratios. These chemical characteristics suggest that the salt load of the inflows originates mostly from re-dissolved windblown halite deposited together with sand up to high altitudes in the bordering mountain ranges. Also, thermal waters ascending along deep faults along the Qilian Mountains carry considerable amounts of chloride. Their low Cl/Br ratio however suggests that most of the dissolved Na is derived from minerals of the basement rocks by fluid-rock interaction at T > 130 degrees C. The thermal fluids also carry considerable amounts of boron, indicating that co-precipitated borax in the salt lakes ultimately also derives from minerals in the basement rocks (tourmaline). Consequently, the presented data improve the understanding how the brines and salt lake waters develop from a wide range of chemically distinct low-TDS inflows and how the sequences of minerals precipitated upon evaporation in the Qaidam basin formed.

It contributes to understanding the thermal comfort regulation mechanisms of landscape nodes and the scientific planning of tour routes. However, the research in this area is relatively limited and faces complex issues in data processing and analysis. This study takes the West Lake waterfront tour route in Hangzhou, China, as an example. Through empirical research, it validates the feasibility of tour route planning guided by thermal comfort. It employs field surveys, on-site measurements, and data analysis methods primarily based on the Rayman software to explore the relationship between urban outdoor waterfront spaces and microclimates. The study reveals the following findings: (i) Extensive water bodies surrounding an area positively regulate local microclimates. The closer one is to the water and the more water surrounds the area, the stronger the microclimate effect. (ii) Factors such as spatial openness, waterfront orientation, prevailing monsoons, etc. all have certain impacts on the microclimates of the lake and lakeside spaces. (iii) Air temperature has significant variability in its impact on human thermal comfort, with different PET (Physiological Equivalent Temperature) values at each measurement point during different time periods. The study combines the actual human thermal comfort conditions at eight measurement points around the lake with existing tour routes. It proposes two practical tour route optimization designs based on real tour microclimate factors. These designs employ thermal comfort assessment methods to effectively enhance and improve human thermal comfort during tours.

J	Gehrels, MJ; Lowe, DJ; Hazell, ZJ; Newnham, RM				Gehrels, MJ; Lowe, DJ; Hazell, ZJ; Newnham, RM			A continuous 5300-yr Holocene cryptotephrostratigraphic record from northern New Zealand and implications for tephrochronology and volcanic hazard assessment	HOLOCENE												A continuous similar to 5280 calendar (cal.) yr long cryptotephrostratigraphic record of a peat core from northern New Zealand demonstrates that cryptotephra Studies can enhance conventional tephra records by extending the known distribution of ash fall and enabling re-assessment of volcanic hazards. A systematic sampling strategy was used to locate peaks in glass-shard concentrations and to determine of individual geochemical populations, and a palynological method involving spiking samples with Lycopodium spores was adapted to facilitate accurate counting of glass-shard concentrations. Using glass-shard major element compositions, and a core chronology based on eight AMS C-14 ages and two visible macroscopic tephra layers, Taupo Tephra (Unit Y) (1688-1748 cal. BP) and Tuhua Tephra (6800-7230 cal. BP) (2 sigma-age ranges), four cryptotephras were correlated with known eruptions: Whakaipo (Unit V) (2743-2782 cal. BP), Stent (Unit Q) (4240-45 10 cal. BP), and Unit K (4970-5290 cal. BP), erupted from Taupo Volcanic Centre, and Whakatane Tephra (5470-5600 cal. BP) erupted from Okataina Volcanic Centre. Mixed glass populations were found in the core, most likely an artefact of post-depositional remobilization of shards vertically (both up and down) in the peat or on its surface by wind, or a result of closely spaced eruption events, or a combination of these. A secondary glass population identified within the macroscopic Taupo Tephra was tentatively attributed to either an earlier phase within that eruption or to mixing with a slightly older Taupo-derived eruptive or (less likely) a currently unknown Okataina-derived eruptive. These results indicate that, in the absence of continuous cryptotephrostratigraphic analysis. a peak in shard concentrations may not in itself be indicative of the 'true' stratigraphic (ie, isochronous) level of a tephra layer. For cryptotephra Studies of peat cores, we recommend (1) using a detailed sampling strategy for the analysis of distal tephra-derived glass to detect and account for any mixed populations and possible vertical spread of glass shards through the peat, and (2) analysing more shards from larger samples to help 'capture' sparsely represented cryptic andesitic tephra deposits.

Climate refugia along Lake Superior's shores: disjunct arctic-alpine plants rely on cool shoreline temperatures but are restricted to highly exposed habitat under climate warming	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Climate refugia can serve as a remnant habitat or stepping stones for species dispersal under climate warming. The largest freshwater lake by surface area, Lake Superior, USA and Canada, serves as a model system for understanding cooling-mediated local refugia, as its cool water temperatures and wave action have maintained shoreline habitats suitable for southern disjunct populations of arctic-alpine plants since deglaciation. Here, we seek to explain spatial patterns and environmental drivers of arctic-alpine plant refugia along Lake Superior's shores, and assess future risk to refugia under moderate (+3.5 degrees C) and warmest (+5.7 degrees C) climate warming scenarios. First, we examined how the interactive effects of summer surface water temperatures and wind affected onshore temperatures, resulting in areas of cooler refugia. Second, we developed an ecological niche model for the presence of disjunct arctic-alpine refugia (pooling 1253 occurrences from 58 species) along the lake's shoreline. Third, we fit species distribution models for 20 of the most common arctic-alpine disjunct species and predicted presence to identify refugia hotspots. Finally, we used the two climate warming scenarios to predict changes in the presence of refugia and disjunct hotspots. Bedrock type, elevation above water, inland distance, July land surface temperature from MODIS/Terra satellite and near-shore depth of water were the best predictors of disjunct occurrences. Overall, we predicted 2236 km of the shoreline (51%) as disjunct refugia habitat for at least one species under current conditions, but this was reduced to 20% and 7% with moderate (894 km) and warmest (313 km) climate change projections.					; Nielsen, Scott/C-2842-2013; Nielsen, Scott/O-7482-2019	Hillman, Ashley/0000-0001-8778-8264; Nielsen, Scott/0000-0002-9754-0630; 													1752-9921	1752-993X				JUL 1	2024	17	4							rtae050	10.1093/jpe/rtae050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtae050		JUL 2024											WOS:001258701000001
J	Shelekhova, T; Lavrova, N				Shelekhova, Tatiana; Lavrova, Nadezhda			Paleoenvironmental reconstructions and a sedimentological evidence of paleoseismic activity ca 9000 yr BP in Karelia, NW Russia, based on lake sediment studies on Mount Vottovaara	BALTICA												Karelia, like the entire Fennoscandian Shield, is a region with a low seismic activity. An example of the best-studied locality is a paleoseismic dislocation on Mount Vottovaara, which bears traces of disastrous Holocene geological events following the degradation of the last ice sheet. The evolution of the study area falls into three stages. At pre-Quaternary stage I, an uplifted block broken by numerous fractures and faults was formed. At glacial stage II, coarse clastic moraine was formed, the moving ice polished the crystalline basement surface and glacial scars were formed. At final deglaciation stages, the mountain top remained a nunatak. As Salpausselka II marginal sediments retreated by about 70 km from the mountain, a postglacial stage in the region's evolution, at which an earthquake occurred, began. It could have been triggered mainly by the consequences of the degradation of the Late Weischelian glaciations such as the rapid removal of the glacial load that contributed to the rejuvenation of various old faults. Changes in paleoecological conditions for the Mount Vottovaara area were reconstructed based on the results of lithological, palynological, diatom and radiocarbon studies of bottom sediments from a small lake on the mountain top. Vegetation dynamics from the Younger Dry as to the Subboreal period is presented. Small lake evolution stages were distinguished based on analysis of diatom complexes and the pollen and spores of aquatic and aquatic-subaquatic plants and Pediastrum algae. The data obtained show that minerogenic sediments were abruptly succeeded by organic in the late Preboreal-early Boreal period. The thickness of Boreal sediments and changes in the composition of diatom complexes and sporc-and-pollcn spectra suggest a depositional hiatus triggered by a strong earthquake which changed the water level of the pond and its basin structure. The earthquake is also indicated by numerous dismembered, displaced, thrown-away and shifted rock blocks and seismogravity downfalls. Deflation and other types of weathering are responsible for the formation of seide-shaped piles of blocks and boulders on the mountain top.

J	Bai, Y; Ali, M; Zhou, Y; Yang, SL				Bai, Yang; Ali, Maroof; Zhou, Yi; Yang, Shiliang			Quantifying marginal utilities of ecosystem services for sustainable management	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Understanding the marginal characteristics of ecosystem services (ESs) is crucial for sustainable management. However, there is limited research on quantifying thresholds for ESs, making it challenging for policymakers to plan effectively. This study established a framework to assess the influencing factors and marginal characteristics of cultural and regulatory ecosystem services (RES) in the Taihu Lake Basin of China and its wetland parks. The framework uses a Structural Equation Model to analyze the impact of visitors' attributes on the perception of different types of cultural ecosystem services (CES). It also employed the InVEST model to quantify the spatial patterns of RES in the basin. Multiple regression analysis and marginal utility theory were used to examine the influencing factors and marginal utilities for different types of cultural and regulatory services. The findings reveal that 1) Education level, income, gender, and age significantly influence the perception of five types of CES provision, with different factors affecting each type. 2) Most park characteristics influence the CES provision score, with their maximum and marginal utility peaks. For instance, as patch density (PD) increases, the score for recreational services initially decreases, then increases, and finally decreases again, reaching a peak of 0.50 at a PD of 325.60. The marginal utility of PD follows a similar pattern, initially increasing and then decreasing, with an increase in utility observed in the range of 0 < PD < 187.80. When PD reaches 187.80, it attains its maximum utility, indicating the point of highest efficiency for PD's impact on recreational services. 3) Heterogeneity exists in the spatial distribution of RES within the basin, with different landscape features providing varying marginal benefits for services like water supply, water purification, carbon storage, and soil erosion prevention. Carbon storage demonstrates an 'increase-then-decrease' pattern in response to rising FP (Percentage of forest area), reaching a maximum value of 13129.3 t/km2 2 at FP of 66.4. The marginal utility of FP also exhibits a 'rise-then- fall' trend, increasing up to FP of 30.4, where it peaks at 230.5. This peak represents the point of maximum efficiency in FP's influence on carbon storage services. 4) The effects of park and landscape characteristics on cultural and regulatory services exhibit marginal utilities that can be used to determine the optimal scale and location of these features to maximize ecological benefits. This research aims to expand the scope of ESs assessment and provide insights from wetland parks for broader environmental planning and optimization.

J	Lee, YT; Hwang, SE; Kim, BT; Kim, KH				Lee, Young -Tae; Hwang, Sung-Eun; Kim, Byeong-Taek; Kim, Ki-Hun			Long Term Flux Variation Analysis on the Boseong Paddy Field	ATMOSPHERE-KOREA												In this paper, Annual flux variations in the Boseong Tall Tower (BTT) from 2016 to 2020 were analyzed using data from three levels (2.5 m, 60 m, and 300 m). BTT was installed in Boseong-gun, Jeollanam-do in February 2014 and continued to conduct energy exchange observations such as CO2, sensible heat, and latent heat using the eddy covariance method until March 2023. The BTT was located in a very flat and uniform paddy field, and flux observations were conducted at four levels: 2.5 m, 60 m, 140 m, and 300 m above ground. Surface energy balance was confirmed from observed data of net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. Additionally, 2.5 m height surface fluxes, which are most influenced by agricultural land, were compared with data from Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) of the Korea Meteorological Administration to evaluate the accuracy of LDAPS flux data. The correlation coefficient between LDAPS flux data and observed values was 0.95 or higher. Excluding summer latent heat flux data, there was a general tendency for LDAPS data to be higher than observed values. The footprint areas estimated below 60 m height mainly covered agricultural land, and flux observations at 2.5 m and 60 m heights showed typical agricultural characteristics. In contrast, the footprint estimated at 300 m height did not show agricultural characteristics, indicating that observations at this height encompassed a wide range, including mountains, sea, and roads. The analysis results of long-term flux observations can contribute to understanding the energy and carbon dioxide fluxes in agricultural fields. Furthermore, these results can be utilized as essential data for validating and improving numerical models related to such fluxes.																			1598-3560	2288-3266					2024	34	1					69	81		10.14191/Atmos.2024.34.1.069	http://dx.doi.org/10.14191/Atmos.2024.34.1.069													WOS:001237570900003
J	TOTH, J; GILLARD, D				TOTH, J; GILLARD, D			EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF A PEATLAND DRAINAGE SYSTEM FOR FORESTRY BY OPTIMIZATION OF SYNTHETIC HYDROGRAPHS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												A ditch system was designed, constructed, and evaluated on a 1-km2 experimental plot in peat-covered wetland in Slave Lake Forest, Alberta, Canada, during 1981-1985. The purpose of the experiment was the development of techniques and procedures for the design of drainage systems for water-table control in large tracts of forested peatlands of northern Alberta, in order to enhance tree growth. The technical objective of the envisaged drainage systems is to prevent the water table from rising above a specified depth, or drainage norm .nu.m, below the land surface, for a continuous time interval longer than a specified flood duration limit .lambda.m, during the growing season. The position of the water table and the rate and amplitude of its fluctuations in a ditched area depend on the environmental parameters (K, hydraulic conductivity; S*, field coefficient of water-table response to precipitation; z, depth to the first effectively impermeable stratum; P, pattern of daily rainfall) the design parameters (L, ditch spacing; u, ditch depth), and at later stages of drainage, the effect of the tree stand. The objective of the design is, therefore, to determine appropriate values of L and u as fucntions of the environmental parameters to be used in the construction of operational drainage systems. The central component of the design procedure is the optimization of synthetic hydrographs. The synthetic hydrograph is a graphical representation of calculated time series of the water table''s fluctuations reflecting the effect of discrete rainfall events under specified drainage conditions. Synthetic hydrographs were calculated with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation drain spacing formula adapted here for daily rainfall events and ranges of estimated enviromental and assumed design parameters. An experimental drainage system was constructed with preliminary design parameters that were expected to satisfy the criteria .nu.m and .lambda.m. In addition, 14 water-table observation wells and a rain gauge were installed and operated for two summers. Synthetic hydrographs were then computed using the actually implemented design parameters, the actual rainfall pattern and a fixed z value, leaving K and S* as the only unknown variables. Those K and S* values giving the best approximation of calculated to observed hydrographs were considred to represent the effective field values and were used in turn to calculate the final design parameters, again by hydrograph matching. Final values for K and S* for two subregions of the experimental plot were found to be K1 = 0.37 m/d, S1* = 0.13; and K2 = 0.26 m/d, S2* = 0.11. For subregion No. 2 a ditch spacing L = 25 m and ditch depth u = 0.9 m satisfy the stipulated drainage norm .nu.m = 0.4 m and flood duration limit .lambda.m = 14 days, using P1962, which was the wettest year for the last 28 years in the region.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				MAR	1988	18	3					353	373		10.1139/x88-053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x88-053													WOS:A1988M857900010
J	Jin, YX; Jin, X				Jin, Yanxiang; Jin, Xin			Variations in δ13CDIC and Influencing Factors in a Shallow Macrophytic Lake on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: Implications for the Regional Carbon Cycle and Sustainable Development	SUSTAINABILITY												Lake carbon cycle in lake ecosystems is critical for regional carbon management. The application of carbon isotope techniques to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems can accurately elucidate carbon flow and carbon cycling. Lake ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are fragile and sensitive to climate and environment changes, and the carbon cycle impact on the carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in these systems has not been well studied, limiting the ability to devise effective management strategies. This study explored the relationship among the delta 13C position of the DIC (delta(CDIC)-C-13) in Genggahai Lake, the lake environment, and the climate of the watershed based on the observed physicochemical parameters of water in areas with different types of submerged macrophyte communities, combined with concomitant temperature and precipitation changes. Overall, the Genggahai Basin delta C-13(DIC) exhibited a large value range; the average delta C-13(DIC) for inflowing spring water was the most negative, followed by the Shazhuyu River, and then lake water. Variations in the photosynthetic intensity of different aquatic plants yielded significantly changing delta C-13(DIC-L) values in areas with varied aquatic plant communities. Hydrochemical observations revealed that delta C-13(DIC-I) and aquatic plant photosynthesis primarily affected the differences in the delta C-13(DIC-L) values of Genggahai Lake, thereby identifying them as the key carbon cycle components in the lake. This improves the understanding of the carbon cycle mechanism of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Lake ecosystem, which is beneficial to improving sustainable lake development strategies.																				2071-1050				APR	2024	16	8							3350	10.3390/su16083350	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16083350													WOS:001211412100001

Materials and methods Both river banks and reservoirs in cities require a specific approach. Natural processes (sediment accumulation, surface runoff, seepage) and human activity (including thoughtless acts of vandalism) force the need for continuous monitoring of banks and taking targeted measures to ensure safety in their vicinity. Properly designed, constructed and maintained reinforcements allows for long-term protection of embankments against damage and protect city residents against flooding. In Poznan, access to the banks of the Warta River and its tributaries is unlimited. Along the waterway there are walking and cycling paths. There are water barrages on the watercourses and reservoirs are among the most attractive spots in the parks. The largest artificial reservoir, Malta Lake on the Cybina River, has a regatta course and a small beach, meaning it is under strong anthropopressure. The stands of regatta course and its technical facilities are utilised during mass events by thousands of water sports enthusiasts. From the first warm days of spring, the banks of the Warta on the downtown section are occupied by Poznan citizens. Open at 4 city beaches water equipment rentals offer kayaks and motorized boats. Results and conclusions The overall condition of checked reinforcements of river banks and water reservoirs should be evaluated as good. The flexible strengthening in a form of a stone coating was in the worst, though still satisfactory, condition.					; Walczak, Zbigniew/KGL-8958-2024; Kałuża, Tomasz/K-2289-2019	Walczak, Natalia/0000-0003-0344-585X; Hammerling, Mateusz/0000-0001-9093-4365; 													1644-0765						2019	18	3					3	17																WOS:000498170800001
J	Straskraba, M; Jorgensen, SE; Patten, BC				Straskraba, Milan; Jorgensen, Sven E.; Patten, Bernard C.			Ecosystems emerging: 6. Differentiation	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												An unlimited variety of within- and across-scale constraints generated by self-organizing processes in ecosystems presents problems for life to solve. Solutions reached at all levels of the ecological hierarchy spawn further constraints in an endless spiral of ecosystem growth and development. Diversification, exposed to natural selection, produces differentiated function within organized wholes. This paper reviews such differentiation over the span of organizational levels from atoms and biochemical molecules to cells and their genetics, from organs and organisms to species and their phylogenetics, from populations and communities to their compositions as ecosystems, and thence to the cosmos itself. On Earth, life occurs in non-extreme and extreme environments, enabled by a biphasic adaptive radiation that drills into and fills available niche space. The first phase is diversification, which is the generation of variations. The second phase is selective differentiation that sculpts meaningful function from an endless stream of diversified, niche-filling possibilities. The paper asks, from the apparent universality of this diversification/differentiation pair, whether or not there is a force in Nature that drives the phenomenon. Diversification arises more in atomism and differentiation in holism, in a part/whole resolution between particulate and aggregate spheres of existence. Examples from Okefenokee Swamp and extreme environments exemplify the two-phase process deep sea, intertidal zones, carnivorous plants in nitrogen-poor conditions, insects in winter, and creatures of deep caves and, perhaps, subglacial lakes. Diversification (Darwin's generation of variants) and differentiation (via natural selection, and other agencies) of Nature's living forms is a prerequisite for Adaptation (our next installment) and the ultimate expression of (our final chapter) systemic Coherence. Liberation through in-system interaction, bonding, and coupling-all antithetical to degrees of freedom is the paradoxical result.

J	SCHLUTER, D				SCHLUTER, D			ADAPTIVE RADIATION IN STICKLEBACKS - SIZE, SHAPE, AND HABITAT USE EFFICIENCY	ECOLOGY												I examined habitat use efficiencies of two morphologically distinct three spine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.). The species make up one of several coexisting pairs that apparently formed in the past 13 000 yr in coastal British Columbia lakes. Previous comparative work has shown that morphology and habitat use are correlated within and among populations. Sticklebacks occurring alone in lakes are intermediate in morphology and habitat use, suggesting that differences between the sympatric species result from ecological character displacement. I tested two hypotheses to explain these patterns, and which are implicit in general views of the causes of adaptive radiation: (1) Each resource (habitat) subjects its species to unique selection pressures, owing to the advantages of certain combinations of traits for foraging; (2) Phenotypes intermediate between habitat specialists suffer a competitive disadvantage. These hypotheses were evaluated by measuring the foraging rates of the two species and their interspecific hybrids in the two main habitats (benthos and open water) provided in the laboratory. Efficiencies of habitat exploitation matched observed morphological differences. In the benthic habitat the larger, deeper bodies species (having also a wide mouth and few short gill rakers) was superior to the smaller, more slender species (having a narrow mouth and many long gill rakers). Success of hybrids was intermediate. This rank order of species efficiencies was reversed in the open water habitat. These results support the hypothesis that different traits are favored in different habitats, and that adaptation to one habitat has occurred at the expense of feeding rate in the other. Average foraging success of hybrids in the two habitats fell near or below the average of the two parental species, suggesting natural selection against intermediate phenotypes. Foraging efficiency in open water was greatest in the smaller size classes of fish, hinting that small size of the open water species is the result of selection for high foraging efficiency. However, size could not explain most differences in feeding efficiency between species, and it is likely that many traits contribute.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1993	74	3					699	709		10.2307/1940797	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940797													WOS:A1993KU39900005

Recovery of sulfate saturated soils in the Plynlimon catchments, mid-Wales following reductions in atmospheric S inputs from the 1980s to 2011	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Sulfate adsorption capacity of B-horizons of base-poor, predominantly stagnopodzol, soils from the Plynlimon catchments, mid-Wales was determined by combination of laboratory adsorption and desorption isotherms. Results show that sulfate adsorption capacity of a range of stagnopodzol (Histic-stagno-podzol (Leptic), WRB), brown podzolic soil (Histic-umbrisol (Leptic), WRB) and stagnohumic gley (Histic-stagno-gleysol, WRB) B-horizons was positively related to the amounts of extractable (pyrophosphate and oxalate) Fe + Al, with the stagnopodzol and brown podzolic soil Bs horizon having the largest adsorption capacity and stagnohumic gley Bg horizon the smallest adsorption capacity. Results show that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has a negative but limited effect on sulfate adsorption in these soils. Results obtained from a set of historical soil samples revealed that the grassland brown podzolic soil Bs horizon and afforested stagnopodzol Bs horizon were highly saturated with sulfate in the 1980s, at 63% and 89% respectively, whereas data from some recently sampled soil from two sites revisited in 2010-11 indicates that percentage sulfate adsorption saturation has since fallen substantially, to 41% and 50% respectively. Between 1984 and 2009 the annual rainfall-weighted mean excess SO4-S concentration in bulk precipitation declined linearly from 0.37 mg S 1(-1) to 0.17 mg S 1(-1). Over the same period, flow weighted annual mean stream water SO4-S concentrations decreased approximately linearly from 1.47 mg S 1(-1) to 0.97 mg S 1(-1) in the plantation afforested Hafren catchment compared to a drop from 1.25 to 0.69 mg S 1(-1) in the adjacent moorland catchment of the Afon Gwy. In flux terms, the mean decrease in annual stream water SO4-S flux has been approximately 0.4 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1), whilst the recovery in stream water quality in the Afon Cyff grassland catchment has been partly offset by loss of SO4-S by desorption from the soil sulfur pool of approximately 0.2 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1)					; Hughes, Steven/G-3596-2011	Dere, Ashlee/0000-0003-3931-0893; 													1464-0325					JUN	2012	14	6					1531	1541		10.1039/c2em30070b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em30070b								22522663					WOS:000304660900003

Michael; Hess, Rachel			A Randomized Clinical Trial Testing Hydroxychloroquine for Reduction of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Shedding and Hospitalization in Early Outpatient COVID-19 Infection	MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM												Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, no effective treatment existed to prevent clinical worsening of COVID-19 among recently diagnosed outpatients. At the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, we conducted a phase 2 prospective parallel group randomized placebo-controlled trial (NCT04342169) to determine whether hydroxychloroquine given early in disease reduces the duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding. We enrolled nonhospitalized adults (>= 18 years of age) with a recent positive diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 (within 72 h of enrollment) and adult household contacts. Participants received either 400 mg hydroxychloroquine by mouth twice daily on day 1 followed by 200 mg by mouth twice daily on days 2 to 5 or oral placebo with the same schedule. We performed SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) on oropharyngeal swabs on days 1 to 14 and 28 and monitored clinical symptomatology, rates of hospitalization, and viral acquisition by adult household contacts. We identified no overall differences in the duration of oropharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio of viral shedding time comparing hydroxychloroquine to placebo, 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91, 1.62). Overall, 28-day hospitalization incidence was similar between treatments (4.6% hydroxychloroquine versus 2.7% placebo). No differences were seen in symptom duration, severity, or viral acquisition in household contacts between treatment groups. The study did not reach the prespecified enrollment target, which was likely influenced by a steep decline in COVID-19 incidence corresponding to the initial vaccine rollout in the spring of 2021. Oropharyngeal swabs were self-collected, which may introduce variability in these results. Placebo treatments were not identical to hydroxychloroquine treatments (capsules versus tablets) which may have led to inadvertent participant unblinding. In this group of community adults early in the COVID-19 pandemic, hydroxychloroquine did not significantly alter the natural history of early COVID-19 disease. (This study has been registered at under registration no. NCT04342169).IMPORTANCE Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, no effective treatment existed to prevent clinical worsening of COVID-19 among recently diagnosed outpatients. Hydroxychloroquine received attention as a possible early treatment; however, quality prospective studies were lacking. We conducted a clinical trial to test the ability of hydroxychloroquine to prevent clinical worsening of COVID-19.

J	Stuart, GSL; Walker, EG				Stuart, Glenn S. L.; Walker, Ernest G.			Pollen and charcoal studies at the Wolf Willow site, Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon, Canada	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												This study aims to determine whether pollen and charcoal analyses of terrestrial samples from the Wolf Willow archaeological site at Wanuskewin Heritage Park, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada could help provide the sorts of data necessary to evaluate the role that environmental conditions may have played in the 6,000 year occupational history of the park. The results indicate that pollen and charcoal were sufficiently preserved for analysis and that pollen assemblages were not significantly affected by downwash or differential preservation. Environmental reconstructions show relatively moist conditions at ca. 4,850 bp continuing into the Oxbow period (ca. 4,800-4,100 bp), when a drying trend developed. The McKean period (ca. 4,200-3,000 bp) reflects a broadly dry period with increasing moisture through time. A hiatus interrupts the record, above which Prairie Side-Notched data (ca. 1,100-600 bp) reveal relatively moist conditions, followed by decreased moisture during Plains Side-Notched times (ca. 600-200 bp), which continued into the recent/historic period. Analyses also indicated possible distinctions between roasting and stone boiling features, repeated spring-time occupation, and task-dependant firewood selection. Comparison of the Wolf Willow records to palaeoenvironmental reconstructions derived from lake cores and other proxy data placed these results within the broader literature on several millennia of Northern Plains climatic and environmental variation. Thus, these results clearly indicate the high potential of such research to address questions regarding human-environment interaction and the role that palaeoenvironmental conditions may have played in drawing indigenous peoples from across the Northern Plains to repeatedly gather at Wanuskewin Heritage Park.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				MAY	2018	27	3					507	525		10.1007/s00334-017-0639-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-017-0639-6													WOS:000428815100007

Pertinent data (length, weight, catch, effort, etc.) were collected on a daily basis for 514 days during 27-12-2003 to 24-05-2005 at the major landing site known as Fish market or AmoraGedel. The sampling days fell into two periods demarcated by the date (08-04-2004) when a management action was implemented, which reduced fishing effort by half (from1954 gillnets/day to below 800 nets/day). Thus, data obtained during 27-12-2003 to 08-04-2004 pertained to the period prior to effort reduction whereas the rest pertained to the period after the reduction. The two data sets were analyzed separately to get a basis to evaluate the effect of the management action of effort reduction. The assessment gave an estimate of current yield of 526.8 t/year for the period before effort reduction whereas 441.6 t/year afterward. The predicted MSY was 514.5 t/year and 441.6 t/year for the period before and after effort reduction, respectively. The respective F-factor is estimated to be 0.5 and 1.0. This suggested that the fishing effort before the reduction of effort (1954nets/day) was very high and, as already implemented, should have been reduced by half(i.e., an F-factor of 0.5). Therefore, the implemented management measure to reduce effort below 800 nets/day is appropriate. Likewise, since the estimated MSY of441.6 t/year for the period after the reduction would be obtained at an F-factor of 1.0, it was concluded that the current level of fishing effort of 696 gillnets/day can be maintained as fopt for sustainable exploitation of the stock.

Tourist market includes all people witch want and feels the need to travel and have the resources to fulfill this desire. In order to make a correct picture of tourism activities from the area, we undertook a detailed analysis of the studied area using various bibliographic sources and other materials on the addressed issue. Brebu Nou commune is located in the central part of Caras Severin County, at 45 km away from the Resita city and 40 km from Caransebes, being formed from localities Bebu Nou and Garana. By its geographical position, the village is one of the pearls of Banat Mountain, so inhabitants and local governments are interested in promoting the tourist potential and creating the necessary infrastructure for increasing the commune attractiveness as a tourist destination. Semenic Mountains, although it is one not of the mountain complex to impress through great heights is of a great beauty and variety, providing a exceptional frame-from the rounded plates, abundant springs and streams, valleys, dense and covered with rich forest. [6] Garana is the place with the best location from this point of view, being close to origin of Timis River, formed by the union of three streams that that give birth, by containment, to lake Trei-Ape.

Slavinetza (eta Sigma lambda alpha beta iota nu epsilon tau zeta alpha). Having considered the results previously established in historiography in connection to the issue, the author concludes that Mokron (Makr) was probably situated in the village of Makar beneathMt. Biokovo, and that Beroullia (Vrulja) was identical with Vrulja near Podgora. Ostrok (Ostrog), in accordance with generally accepted oppinion, is to be located in the immediate vicinity of today's Zaostrog, at the foot of the Mt. Viter, while, considering Slavinetza, it is assumed that it was situated in the region of the Bacina lakes, near the ruins of Sladinac, where are the remnants of the old Church of St Andrew, although the possibility that it should be searched for in the area of today's Gradac, near the Slavinjac spring, mentioned in a description of Gradac from 1863, should not be excluded.																			0584-9888	2406-0917					2013		50					301	334		10.2298/ZRVI1350301M	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZRVI1350301M													WOS:000421359900020

Rise and fall: increasing temperatures have nonlinear effects on aggression in a tropical fish	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Environmental conditions are fundamental drivers of animal behaviour. Aggression in ectotherms is a marked example and is often considered positively correlated with temperature. However, many studies exploring this relationship, and its important consequences, focus on a few temperatures and implicitly assume a linear relationship between the two variables. This may limit our understanding of the influence of temperature on aggression. We measured levels of aggression in Neolamprologus pulcher, a cichlid fish commonly used as a model in studies of aggression-based social hierarchy, across a range of temperatures in a mirror aggression test. We used temperatures expected from their natural range with a 2 degrees C extension on either end. As predicted by thermal performance curves, rates of aggression increased with temperature at the lower end of the temperature range. After reaching a peak, any further increase in temperature resulted in a considerable drop in rates of aggression. Exploring responses at a finer temporal scale, we found that the influence of high temperatures changed dramatically during the 25 min trials. Early in the trials the frequency of aggression increased linearly with temperature, across all temperatures. The initially high levels of aggression at the higher temperatures were not sustained and dropped with increasing duration of exposure to the mirror at high temperatures. Together these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of short-term exposure to different temperatures on aggression, such as acute exposure to increased temperatures caused by global warming and associated rapid thermal fluctuations, in African rift lake fishes and in ectotherms more generally. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of measuring aggression across a range of temperatures or otherwise account for nonlinear changes in thermal performance. (c) 2023 The Authors.

J	Prudnikova, TN				Prudnikova, T. N.			Peculiarities of Paleogeography of the Ubsunur Basin in 2022	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Studies of the paleogeographical properties of the Ubsunur Basin located on the territory of northwestern Mongolia and southern Tuva are based on the discovery of buried ice veins under Aeolian sediments in the region of Lake Khar-Nur in the eastern mountainous frame of the Great Lakes Basin of Western Mongolia. Satellite images have shown outlines of fields along the periphery of the sand deposits, the natural irrigation of which, in our opinion, was due to the melting of the abovementioned ice. Deposits similar to glacial ones have been found in the river valleys of the northern mountainous framing of the Ubsunur Basin, in its foothill part, suggesting the presence of Pleistocene glaciers extending into its flat plains. It is also assumed on this basis that, similarly to Lake Khar-Nur, the peculiar sandy massifs located in the basin could preserve relic zones of permafrost, the thawing of which contributed to the moistening of local landscapes. Such humidification zones have been seen on satellite images. There are no glacial deposits in this territory in geological legends. At this stage of research, we confirm the presence in the past of thin glaciers in the study site, caused by mountain-forming processes, and the eruption of Quaternary volcanoes on the territory of Tuva and Mongolia. Tectonic processes contributed to the damming of the Tes Khem River, the main waterway flowing along the northern mountain rim of the basin, the formation of dammed lakes, and their subsequent descent. Extended original sandy massifs located in the basin within the Agardag mountain range, previously considered fluvioglacial deposits, are a result of the descent of dammed lakes.																			0001-4338	1555-628X				DEC	2023	59	9					1070	1081		10.1134/S0001433823090153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001433823090153													WOS:001154795900015

The objectives of this work were to study the relations between morphophysiological traits when flooding occurs, determining the most important to assess genotypes' tolerance, and evaluate the ability of cupuassu genotypes to express alternative phenotypes and grow efficiently, in order to select materials capable of sustaining hypoxic conditions. The trial was carried out in a greenhouse, in a completely randomized design with a 16 x 2 (16 progenies and two water regimes) factorial scheme and four replications. Treatments started six months after the seedlings were transplanted. 15 traits related to vegetative development, biomass accumulation and physiology were measured for the experimental evaluation. Correlations and principal components were estimated to study the traits' interrelationships and identify the most important to assist progeny selection. The results revealed that, among the evaluated traits, ten were sufficient to explain the variability within the population and four were elected as the most relevant to select the best progenies. 75% of the genotypes showed tolerance to partial flooding and based on performance and plasticity, we selected G174, G48 and G56 for a broader spectrum and G44, G47 and G51 for hypoxic conditions only. The promising evidence pointed out here will need to be corroborated with field tests, so that the cupuassu tree can be recommended in the recovery of environments subject to hypoxia.					; da Silva Chaves, Saulo Fabricio/ABD-4707-2020; Chaves, Saulo/ABD-4707-2020	Barbosa Rodrigues, Jardel Diego/0000-0002-8354-8463; da Silva Chaves, Saulo Fabricio/0000-0002-0694-1798; 													0100-2945	1806-9967					2023	45								e948	10.1590/0100-29452023948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0100-29452023948													WOS:001059488300001

The current inability to replicate EEDV in vitro necessitates the search for a reproducible, sensitive, and specific assay that allows for its detection and quantitation in a time- and cost-effective manner. Herein, we describe a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that was developed for the quantitative detection of EEDV in infected fish tissues. The newly developed LAMP reaction was optimized in the presence of calcein, and the best results were produced using 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM dNTPs and at an incubation temperature of 67.1 degrees C. This method was highly specific to EEDV, as it showed no cross-reactivity with several fish viruses, including Salmonid Herpesvirus(-1), -2, -4, and -5, Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus, Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, Golden Shiner Reovirus, Fathead Minnow Nidovirus, and Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus. The analytical sensitivity of the EEDV-LAMP method was estimated to be as low as 16 copies of plasmid per reaction. When infected fish tissue was used, a positive reaction could be obtained when an infected gill tissue sample that contained 430 viral copies/mu g was diluted up to five orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed LAMP assay compared to the SYBR Green qPCR assay were 84.3% and 93.3%, respectively. The quantitative LAMP for EEDV had a correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.980), and did not differ significantly from the SYBR Green quantitative PCR assay (p > 0.05). Given its cost- and time-effectiveness, this quantitative LAMP assay is suitable for screening lake trout populations and for the initial diagnosis of clinical cases.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022; Loch, Thomas/AAC-1475-2020	Zhang, Qingli/0000-0002-0406-8825; 													0166-0934	1879-0984				FEB	2019	264						44	50		10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.11.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.11.006								30444983					WOS:000456222300007

THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SPECIFICS OF THE POLYMERS APPLICATION AS AUXILIARY SUBSTANCE IN THE COSMETICS COMPOSITIONS BASED ON NATURAL MINERAL SALTS	PHARMACY & PHARMACOLOGY-FARMATSIYA I FARMAKOLOGIYA												These days Natural mineral salts (biologically active ingredients), which are the components of thermal springs, sea water, brine lakes, minerals (bischofite) are widely used in the composition of cosmetic products. The ability to influence the formulations stability and the sensory properties of cosmetics products is the specificity of this materials group, which creates certain difficulties in the development of a composition. The polymers' use as gelling agents and thickeners is one of the means of formulations stability improving. The aim was scientific and technical literature review of the polymers assortment used in cosmetics with natural mineral salts, their application in the cosmetic compositions and the influence of mineral salts on the properties of polymers solutions. Materials and methods. Resources such as eLIBRARY, PubMed, Cyberleninca, as well as the websites of the manufacturers and suppliers of auxiliary materials, and finished cosmetic products were used to obtain the data. Results and discussion. Analysis of literature data and technical information suggests that cellulose derivatives, xanthan gum, and polyvinylpyrrolidone and carbomer are the most commonly used polymers in cosmetic compositions with natural mineral salts. These substances carry out functions of gelling agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, binders, sensorial modifier agents. There is insufficient information about the interaction of polymers with the natural mineral salts and their influence on polymers properties in scientific and technical literature. The complexity and uniqueness of the composition of natural salts also represents certain difficulty in the evaluation of the interaction. Conclusion. Thus, regularities and peculiarities of natural mineral salts influence on the stability of solutions of polymers used in cosmetics as thickeners and gelling agents, is a promising direction of modern pharmaceutical practices study.

The El Mellah Lagoon (EML) located in extreme north-eastern Algeria, is the only coastal lagoon in the southern Mediterranean with low human pressure due to few human activities and its protected status under the Ramsar Convention. We investigated the structure of the fish food-web in the spring at four stations in the lagoon that differed in their proximity to rivers and the channel, which connects to the sea. The results provided insight into ecological functions of EML as a feeding area for all fish species caught in the lagoon, in particular marine migrant juveniles and resident species. The delta 13C results highlighted the importance of marine organic matter on the functioning of the EML fish food-web, to which organic matter in marine sediments and likely microphytobenthos contribute most. Our study also revealed the importance of seagrass (Ruppia sp.) for detritivorous fish (i.e., Mugilidae species) and for their potential to shelter a wide variety of benthic invertebrates that are potential food sources for benthivorous fish. Our study revealed the small influence of freshwater inputs on the functioning of the EML food-web and that juvenile marine fish may use the lagoon for reasons other than feeding, most likely to avoid predation and obtain physiological advantages.

AFTER HARVEST AND AFTER STORAGE IN FISH STORAGE TANKS	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES												The aim of the present study was to determine whether the influence of fish pond and fish storage tank conditions change the content of phthalic acid esters (di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) in the carcass of the Common carp. Samples obtained from the autumn harvest of two fish ponds (R1 and R2) in 2007 and 2010 from the South Moravia and after a seven-week-long storage in fish storage tanks were analyzed. It was found that in the samples (2007) from both fish ponds after storage in fish storage tanks the content of DBP increased, for R1 from 0.56 +/- 0.39 mg.kg(-1) to 0.83 +/- 0.26 mg.kg(-1) and for R2 from 0.31 +/- 0.08 mg.kg(-1) to 0.35 +/- 0.11 mg.kg(-1) of original weight. Concerning DEHP, in samples obtained from the fish pond R1 after storage in fish storage tanks the mean concentration increased from 0.26 +/- 0.23 mg.kg(-1) to 0.72 +/- 0.16 mg.kg(-1) and from R2 it decreased from 0.71 +/- 0.17 mg.kg(-1) to 0.12 +/- 0.18 mg.kg(-1) of original weight. The experiment conducted in 2010 should have confirmed or disconfirm this trend. The average value of the DBP contents for R1 increased slightly from 0.15 +/- 0.04 mg.kg(-1) after harvest to 0.18 +/- 0.05 mg.kg(-1) of original weight after the storage in fish storage tank and for R2 from 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg.kg(-1) after harvest to 0.16 +/- 0.06 mg.kg(-1) of original weight after storage in fish storage tank. Similarly, an increasing tendency also occurred for DEHP, for R1 the value of 0.08 +/- 0.02 mg.kg(-1) after harvesting increased to 0.14 +/- 0.04 mg.kg(-1) of original weight after storage in fish storage tank and for R2 from 0.09 +/- 0.03 mg.kg(-1) after harvesting to 0.16 +/- 0.06 mg.kg(-1) after storage in fish storage tank. For all samples in both lakes in 2007 as well as in 2010 both phthalates showed slightly increasing trend except for DEHP in samples collected in 2007 from the fish pond R2.

Indeed, because of Brownian motion, colloids do not settle individually, even in still water; however, they can aggregate into larger particles and start to settle entraining bound or embedded compounds. Aggregation, and ultimately colloid removal rates, can strongly be enhanced during a phytoplankton bloom, particularly through the production of sticking exopolymers (PASSOW 2002) released by phytoplankton (JACKSON & BURD 1998). Sticking exopolymers are also known to promote diatom aggregation in both marine (ALLDREGDE & JACKSON 1995 and other references in this special issue) and freshwater systems (HOFFMAN et al. 2001). In an international project aiming to assess trace metal removal in Lake Geneva during a phytoplanktonic bloom, colloids were extensively studied during 3 field campaigns before, during, and after the 2006 spring bloom. Changes in size, concentration, composition, and aggregation rate of colloids with time will be extensively presented elsewhere (V. Chanudet, unpubl.). Here we present specifically the results of the second campaign (bloom), in which phytoplankton was expected to most influence the colloidal particle size distribution and play a significant role in the aggregation process. To verify this assumption, we carried out experiments on colloid aggregation using a single particle counter (SPC), a unique tool allowing measurements of colloids in the size range 0.1-2 mu m at natural concentrations. We were able to demonstrate that during an early phase of bloom in lakes, small centric diatoms settle individually rather than as aggregates, possibly because of a low concentration of exopolymers.

Under the assumption that increased algal production moves up the food web to fish, we fertilized Grayson Lake, Kentucky, surface water with high N to P ratio fertilizer during springs 1994 and 1995. April through July 1994 we added 1 kg P/ha and 22 kg N/ha over a 9-week period to approximately 162 ha of lake surface area. During 1995 we increased loading to 7 kg P/ha with 22 kg N/ha. Weekly photic zone water samples were taken directly after fertilization (within I day). Water quality and primary production were assessed in fertilized and unfertilized lake regions. Alkalinity, inorganic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and chlorophyll a concentrations were not significantly higher in the fertilized areas (N = 40 in 1994, N = .50 in 1995, P > 0.1 Mann-Whitney test). Secchi depth was also unaffected by fertilization. The large volume and rapid hydrologic renewal probably contributed to the lack of increased primary production after fertilization. Although total P always averaged greater than 57 mug/liter, chlorophyll a never averaged higher than 4.7 mug/liter. Secchi depths averaged less than 1.7 m, suggesting non-algal turbidity was high. We conclude that fertilization is an ineffective technique to increase fish production in large reservoirs (e.g., kilometers long) because factors other than nutrient concentrations, such as temperature, light, available habitat, and top-down predation, may determine primary productivity and fish survival.																									2001							270	279																WOS:000184053000025

It is pathogenic to humans, causing a rare and fatal brain infection known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). A previous study utilized RNA-seq analysis to examine genes expressed in N. fowleri cysts and trophozoites, focusing on the nf-profilin gene, which showed high expression in cysts. Profilin is a small actin-binding protein that regulates nf-actin polymerization and cell movement. Sequence analysis revealed 83% similarity with non-pathogenic N. gruberi and 38% similarity with Acanthamoeba castellanii. Nf-profilin was found to be associated with N. fowleri lysates but not with lysates from other amoebae, as shown by Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that nf-profilin primarily localized to the cell membrane in N. fowleri cysts, while nf-actin localized to the cytoplasm, pseudopodia, and food-cup structures. Real-time RT-PCR indicated higher expression of the nf-profilin gene in cysts compared to trophozoites. In co-culture experiments with target cells, Nf-profilin was initially expressed in the cytoplasm of N. fowleri cysts and the morphology of cyst gradually transitioned to the trophozoite form. Concurrently, the expression of Nf-profilin protein decreased, while Nf-actin protein began to appear in the pseudopodia and food-cups of trophozoites. In conclusion, the nf-profilin and nf-actin genes exhibited complementary expression patterns based on the life stage of N. fowleri, indicating their critical roles in the survival and proliferation. This study emphasizes the significance of actin-binding proteins in understanding the infection and pathogenic mechanisms of N. fowleri.																			2045-2322					FEB 27	2025	15	1							7015	10.1038/s41598-025-90222-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90222-w								40016342					WOS:001462664100018
J	Wilson, N				Wilson, N			Community-based stream conservation initiatives in British Columbia, Canada	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					4th International River Symposium	AUG 29-31, 2001	BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA					British Columbia is a diverse province, with ecosystems ranging from semi-arid deserts to valley glaciers and vast ice fields. By world standards, BC has an abundance of fresh water in its lakes and rivers. However, rivers have been exploited for social and industrial purposes, often to the detriment of the natural values. Community groups and non-government organizations have been active in rehabilitating and restoring waterways. The Outdoor Recreation Council of BC is a provincial non-government organization that has been instrumental in river conservation issues in BC. Three key initiatives have been established by the Council since its formation in 1975. BC Rivers Day has grown into the largest river celebration of its kind in North America, and there is a move to establish a national Rivers Day in Canada based on the model established in BC. Second is the annual Endangered Rivers List compiled by the Council and released each spring. The third initiative is the River Recovery Project in which dams and impoundment structures were evaluated against a set of criteria. A short list of candidates was generated by the project that will be further studied to determine what actions should be taken to alter the management of the structures to restore ecological values of the rivers and streams on which they are built. The three initiatives described rely on local community support. The Outdoor Recreation Council of BC provides coordination, promotion, and publicity as well as some resource materials while local groups and communities take on stewardship roles for their local streams. This model may be useful for other jurisdictions.																			0273-1223						2002	45	11					171	175		10.2166/wst.2002.0392	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2002.0392								12171349					WOS:000177371700021
J	Gürkan, R; Çaylak, O				Gurkan, Ramazan; Caylak, Osman			Catalytic Spectrophotometry for the Determination of Manganese at Trace Levels by a Novel Indicator Reaction	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY-DAEHAN HWAHAK HOE JEE												A new kinetic s pectrophotometric method is developed for the measurement of Mn(II) in natural water samples. The method is based on the catalytic effect of Mn(II) with the oxidation of Gallocyanin by KIO4 using nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as an activation reagent at 620 nm. The optimum conditions obtained are 4.00 x 10(-5) M Gallocyanin, 1.00 x 10(-4) M KIO4, 1.00 x 10(-4) M NTA, 0.1 M HAc/NaAc buffer of pH = 3.50, the reaction time of 5 min and the temperature of 30 degrees C. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed method allows the measurement of Mn(II) in a range of 0.1 -4.0 ng mL(-1) and with a detection limit of down to 0.025 ng mL(-1). The recovery efficiency in measuring the standard Mn(II) solution is in a range of 98.5 - 102%, and the RSD is in a range of 0.76 - 1.25%. The newly developed kinetic method has been successfully applied to the measurement of Mn(II) in both some environmental water samples and certified standard reference river water sample, JAC-0031 with satisfying results. Moreover, few cations and anions interfere with the measurement of Mn(II). Compared with the other catalytic-kinetic methods and instrumental methods, the proposed kinetic method shows fairly good selectivity and sensitivity, low cost, cheapness, low detection limit and rapidity. It can easily and successfully be applied to the real water samples with relatively low salt content and complex matrices such as bottled drinking water, cold and hot spring waters, lake water, river water samples.

Partitioning behavior of trace elements between dacitic melt and plagioclase, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene based on laser ablation ICPMS analysis of silicate melt inclusions	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Partitioning behavior of Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Yb, Hf, and Pb between dacitic silicate melt and clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and plagioclase has been determined based on laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (LA-ICPMS) analysis of melt inclusions and the immediately adjacent host mineral. Samples from the 1988 eruption of White Island, New Zealand were selected because petrographic evidence suggests that all three mineral phases are in equilibrium with each other and with the melt inclusions. All three phenocryst types are found as mineral inclusions within each of the other phases, and mineral inclusions often coexist with melt inclusions in growth-zone assemblages. Compositions of melt inclusions do not vary between the different host minerals, suggesting that boundary layer processes did not affect compositions of melt inclusions and that post-trapping modifications have not occurred. Partition coefficients were calculated from the host and melt inclusion compositions and results were compared to published values. All trace elements examined in this study except Sr are incompatible in plagioclase, and all measured trace elements except for Mn are incompatible in orthopyroxene. In clinopyroxene, Sc, V, and Mn are compatible, and Y, Ti, HREE, and the MREE are only slightly incompatible. Most partition coefficients overlap the wide range of values reported in the literature, but the White Island data are consistently at the lower end of the range in published values. Results from the literature obtained using modern microanalytical techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) or proton induced X-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) also fall at the lower end of the published values, whereas partition coefficients determined from bulk analysis of glass and crystals separated from volcanic rocks typically extend to higher values. Rapid crystal growth-rates, crystal zonation, or the presence of accessory mineral inclusions in phenocrysts likely accounts for the wide range and generally higher partition coefficients obtained using bulk sampling techniques. The results for 3+ cations from this study are consistent with theoretical predictions based on a lattice strain model for site occupancy. The results also confirm that the melt inclusion-mineral (MIM) technique is a reliable method for determining partition coefficients, as long as the melt inclusions have not experienced post-entrapment reequilibration.

J	Hakanson, L				Hakanson, L			A simple model to predict the duration of the mercury problem in Sweden	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There are about 83 000 lakes in Sweden; about 40 000 lakes have fish (here = 1 kg pike) with Hg-concentrations above the guideline of 0.5 mg Hg/kg ww; about 10 000 lakes have pike with Hg-concentrations higher than the 'blacklisting' limit of 1.0 mg Hg/kg ww. How long will this situation last? The answer to that question involves many complex processes and assumptions about future developments, and is, thus, a very interesting area for modelling. The basic aim of this work has been to present a dynamic model to address this question, and critically evaluate the rates and environmental factors regulating the recovery process, so that quantitative predictions concerning the duration of the mercury problem in Sweden may be obtained. This modelling approach suggests that it would take very long, till about year 2360, until the mean Hg-concentration in pike would fall from the present of about 1 below the guideline value of 0.5. This model is based on certain assumptions about the future Swedish and European Hg-emissions. Sensitivity and uncertainty tests indicate that the most important rates regulating the uncertainties in the model predictions, and hence the duration of the mercury problem, are the processes governing the transport of mercury from land to water, and not lake processes. These land to lake fluxes, are, in turn, regulated by the atmospheric emissions and the deposition of mercury via wet and dry deposition. The only way to remediate the mercury problem (i.e., high concentrations of Hg in fish used for human consumption) is to reduce the basic cause of the problem, i.e., the anthropogenic emissions related to, e.,g., the burning of fossil fuels, and the industrial use of Hg in the technosphere.																			0304-3800					DEC 16	1996	93	1-3					251	262		10.1016/S0304-3800(96)00006-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3800(96)00006-3													WOS:A1996VZ40400020
J	Dortch, J; Cupper, M; Grün, R; Harpley, B; Lee, K; Field, J				Dortch, Joe; Cupper, Matt; Grun, Rainer; Harpley, Bernice; Lee, Kerrie; Field, Judith			The timing and cause of megafauna mass deaths at Lancefield Swamp, south-eastern Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lancefield Swamp, south-eastern Australia, was one of the earliest sites to provoke interest in Pleistocene faunal extinctions in Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea). The systematic investigation of the deposit in the early 1970s identified megafaunal remains dominated by the 100-200 kg kangaroo Macropus giganteus titan. Associated radiocarbon ages indicated that the species was extant until c.30,000 BP, suggesting significant overlap with human settlement of Sahul. This evidence was inconsistent with contemporary models of rapid human-driven extinctions. Instead, researchers inferred ecological tethering of fauna at Lancefield Swamp due to intense drought precipitated localised mass deaths, consistent with Late Pleistocene climatic variability. Later investigations in another part of the swamp, the Mayne Site, remote to the initial investigations, concluded that mass flow disturbed this area, and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses on megafauna teeth returned wide-ranging ages. To clarify site formation processes and dating of Lancefield Swamp, we excavated new test-pits next to previous trenches in the Classic and Mayne Sites. We compared absolute chronologies for sediments and teeth, sedimentology, palaeo-topography, taphonomy, and macropod age at death across the swamp. Luminescence dating of sediments and ESR analysis of teeth returned ages between c.80,000 and 45,000 years ago. We found no archaeological remains in the bone beds, and evidence of carnivore activity and fluvial action, in the form of reactivated spring flow. The latter disturbed limited parts of the site and substantial areas of the bone beds remained intact. The faunal assemblage is dominated by megafaunal adult Macropus, consistent with mass die-offs due to severe drought. Such droughts appear to have recurred over millennia during the climatic variability of Marine Isotope Stages 4 and 3. These events began tens of millennia before the first appearance of Aboriginal people in Sahul and only the very youngest fossil deposits could be coeval with the earliest human arrivals. Therefore, anthropogenic causes cannot be implicated in most if not all of mass deaths at the site. Climatic and environmental changes were the main factors in site formation and megafauna deaths at Lancefield Swamp. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, GJ; Wang, XQ; Deng, L				Huang, Guojia; Wang, Xiaoqing; Deng, Long			Predicting phytoplankton assemblages growth and estimating critical N: P ratios with experimental nutrient additions in a drinking water reservoir of central China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of limiting nutrients and the N: P ratios on the growth of phytoplankton. In this study, we used the nutrient enrichment bioassays (NEB), Multivariate analysis of variance, and regression analysis. The results showed that the affected change of phytoplankton assemblages growth was the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous. During the same period, the response time of phytoplankton to the input of external nutrients was similar. The growth rates of phytoplankton were not persistent. This is related to the differences in environmental conditions, dominant species composition, and phytoplankton growth strategies. Different dominant species also had different response mechanisms to nutrient addition. The growth effect of phytoplankton in the preliminary experiment in the laboratory was more significant than that in the field experiment. Water temperature and light were also important environmental factors affecting the growth of phytoplankton. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that phosphorus addition alone had a more significant stimulation on phytoplankton growth than that of nitrogen, especially for Synedra. But addition of both nitrogen and phosphorus had the most stimulating effect on Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta. The phytoplankton had the maximum growth in TN: TP = 19.87, phytoplankton growth was promoted with 0.9 & SIM; 13.59 mg/L TN and 0.02 & SIM; 0.684 mg/L TP. When the total phosphorus in summer was greater than 0.04 mg/L, the possibility of algal bloom and will be greater. The linear regression fitted chlorophyll a and phosphorus well, and the regression equation was as follows: Log(10)(Chl.a) = 2.154 + 0.5103 x Log(10)(TP). The binary regression equation of chlorophyll a and nitrogen and phosphorus was as follows: Chl.a = 33.84 + 1.769TN + 123.9TP.

However, the climate patterns on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), including temperature and hydrological variations, during the Common Era, and their possible links with productivity, are poorly understood. We present a quantitative reconstruction of mean annual air temperature (MAAT), together with grain size and other sedimentary records, from a nonglacial lake sediment archive on the central TP, with the objective of tracking changes in climate and lake catchment productivity over the past two millennia. Our results reveal an overall cooling trend in temperature reconstructed from branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), with multi-centennial-scale fluctuations superimposed. These fluctuations include relatively warm periods during 200 BCE-400 CE and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1050-1400 CE), and cold periods centered on -500-1000 CE and the Little Ice Age (-1500-1900 CE). A rapid warming trend since 1900 CE corresponds to the Current Warm Period. The variations in sedimentary grain size reflect lake level changes associated with changes in the summer monsoon. Paleoproductivity inferred from total organic carbon (TOC) shows a similar pattern to the paleoclimate records, suggesting that millennial-scale productivity was influenced by both temperature and the catchment hydrology. In recent decades, human activities exerted a more substantial influence on lake productivity. Additionally, we suggest that the use of brGDGTs for temperature reconstruction necessitates the investigation of the temperature relationship of various fractions of brGDGTs, specifically tetramethyl-brGDGTs; and that careful selection of the temperature calibration equation is needed to minimize inaccuracies in paleotemperature reconstruction.

Managing cyanobacteria with a water quality control curtain in Iron Gate Reservoir, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Mejica BN, Ebert DA, Tanaka SK, Deas ML. 2023. Managing cyanobacteria with a water quality control curtain in Iron Gate Reservoir, California. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX.Iron Gate Reservoir, a eutrophic monomictic reservoir on the Klamath River, a Pacific coast river within the United States, stratifies thermally during summer and is subject to cyanobacteria blooms that produce microcystin toxins, causing public health concerns. An impermeable curtain was installed in Iron Gate Reservoir upstream of the powerhouse intake to control the withdrawal depth and improve water quality of releases to the downstream Klamath River. Thermal stratification minimizes vertical downward movement of cyanobacteria-laden near-surface waters, and the curtain was hypothesized to reduce cyanobacteria and toxin concentrations downstream of the curtain and dam. The Wedderburn number, which indicates unstable (mixed) or stratified conditions, was used to calculate mixed layer depths and define conditions under which the curtain would be likely to be effective. Changes in chlorophyll a, cyanobacteria gene, Microcystis spp. gene, and microcystin concentrations were used to quantify curtain effectiveness for different curtain depths and mixed layer depths. When curtain depth extended below the mixed layer, concentrations of total chlorophyll a, total cyanobacteria, total Microcystis spp., and total microcystin in waters downstream of the curtain were statistically significantly reduced by an average of 87, 90, 78, and 64%, respectively. Concentrations were not consistently reduced downstream of the curtain under other configurations. Findings indicate the curtain can be managed to take advantage of stratification within the epilimnion and address issues pertaining to downstream cyanobacteria and associated toxins, and should improve water quality and reduce public health notices for the 305.7 km of river downstream of Iron Gate Dam.

Study of Thermokarst Lake Size Distribution in the Eastern Part of the Russian Arctic Based on Combining Sentinel-2 and Kanopus-V Images	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The article is devoted to remote studies of the size distribution of thermokarst lakes in the eastern part of the Russian Arctic. The studies are carried out in the Arctic territories of the Northeastern tundra (NET) (Yakutia) and the Chukotka tundra (CT), which are relatively homogeneous areas in terms of their natural properties (referred to here as ecoregions). Remote studies of the distribution of thermokarst lakes by area are conducted using satellite images from Kanopus-V and Sentinel-2 (with spatial resolutions of 2.1 and 20 m, respectively), obtained in the summer months of 2017-2021. The lakes are interpreted using a Sentinel-2 satellite image mosaic, which provides full coverage of the study territories; Kanopus-V images at 12 test sites; and QGIS 3.22 tools. We briefly describe the method of integration (combination) of data from Kanopus-V and Sentinel-2 images for plotting synthesized histograms of lakes distribution by their sizes. This technique allows us to get histograms of lake distribution in a very wide range of their sizes from 50 to 108 m2 in the studied Arctic ecoregions. The histogram plots show a similar behavior in both ecoregions, manifesting itself in an increase in the number of lakes as their size decreases. It is shown that the main contribution to the number of lakes in the NET is made by much larger lakes than in the CT, which may indicate a significant difference in the geocryological conditions in different Arctic territories of the eastern part of the Russian Arctic. The degree of the lake cover of the territories is assessed. It is shown that the lake cover of the NET is 7 times higher than in the studied territories of Chukotka.																			0001-4338	1555-628X				DEC	2023	59	10					1459	1464		10.1134/S0001433823120150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001433823120150													WOS:001167360400007
J	Goldberg, K; Mallawa, M				Goldberg, Karin; Mallawa, Minindu			Origin of Chert Horizons in the Permian Florence Limestone, Flint Hills, Kansas	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The ubiquitous chert horizons found in Permian limestones in the Flint Hills, Kansas, confer the rolling-hills topography of the region and have been used by prehistoric communities to make tools. The source of silica and mode of formation of these 'layers', however, remained elusive. The integration of fieldwork, petrographic analysis, x-ray diffraction, laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS), Raman spectroscopy and oxygen isotopic analysis in the silica-bearing Florence limestone revealed that the chert horizons are coalescing nodules formed during multiple silicification events. Early diagenetic precipitation of opal along burrow pathways was followed by the precipitation of, and replacement by, microquartz, chalcedony and subordinately megaquartz at later stages. The germanium-silica ratios of 0.4 x 106 to 1.25 x 106, obtained for the different silica phases (opal, microquartz, chalcedony and megaquartz), are compatible with a biogenic origin for the silicifying solutions, corroborated by the presence of siliceous bioclasts (sponge spicules and radiolarians) in the limestones. Oxygen isotope data estimated the temperature of precipitation to be between 22 degrees C and 24 degrees C, in agreement with the eogenetic conditions interpreted from the paragenetic relations. The identification of moganite, along with the presence of halite moulds and sulphate nodules in the succession, indicates that evaporitic conditions contributed to silica supersaturation. Silicifying solutions derived from the dissolution of siliceous organisms, augmented by highly evaporative conditions, precipitated initially opal along burrow networks on the Permian seafloor, followed by cementation and replacement by microquartz, chalcedony and finally megaquartz during eogenesis.																			0072-1050	1099-1034				2025 OCT 16	2025										10.1002/gj.70106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gj.70106		OCT 2025											WOS:001594378900001

Based on extensive field work and database evaluation (meteorological, hydrological and statistical data) from the Zarafshan River (Tajikistan/Uzbekistan) and the Tarim River (Kyrgyzstan/China), the status quo of the water resources is assessed and scenarios for the impacts of climate change on the water availability and water use are outlined. The results show that the extensive withdrawal of water for irrigation farming (with cotton being the most important crop) and the discharge of agricultural drainage water lead to severe water stress in the downstream parts of both catchments. The water deficit is so high that both rivers do not reach their tributaries (Amu-Darya and Lop Nor/Taitema Lake) any more. In the lower Zarafshan River (inter) national thresholds for several pollutants are exceeded permanently, while in the lower Tarim River the falling groundwater level is leading to the deterioration of the valuable Tugai forests. And while short-term measures, like the water transfer from the Boston Lake to the lower Tarim, can relieve some of the pressure, the ongoing climate change and socio-economic growth in both catchments require a more integrated, sustainable management approach. The rapidly shrinking glaciers in the headwater regions (-50% until 2050) and the drastic rise of the air temperature (and thus the evapotranspiration) will increase the annual water deficit (e.g. in the Zarafshan River catchment from currently 1.6 km(3) to up to 5.8 km(3)), making a more efficient (re-)use of water a necessity.

Diverse communities are even found in such places in which extreme conditions with respect of temperature, salinity, pH, and pressure prevail. Many of these environments were until recently considered too harsh to harbor microbial Life. The microorganisms adapted to an existence at the edge of life are termed extremophiles. They include members of the Prokaryotes (domains Archaea and Bacteria) and the Eukarya, including algae and protozoa. Extremophilic microbes thrive at low and high temperatures - from subzero levels to above the boiling point of water, at both sides of the pH scale - in acidic as well as in alkaline media, in hypersaline environments with salt concentrations of up to saturation, at high pressure, both in the deep sea and in the terrestrial deep subsurface where they are exposed to pressures of hundreds of atmospheres, and in other extreme conditions. Fn many cases they tolerate combinations of more than one environmental stress factor. Some of these extremophiles may be considered as "living fossils" since their environment resembles the conditions that may have existed during the time life arose on Earth more than 3.5 billion years ago. In view of these properties the extremophilic microorganisms may be considered as model organisms when exploring the possibilities of the existence of extraterrestrial life. For example, the microbes discovered in ice cores recovered from the depth of the Lake Vostok in Antarctica may serve as a model simulating conditions prevailing in the permafrost subsurface area of Mars or Jupiter's moon Europa. Microbial life in the Dead Sea or in Great Salt Lake may resemble halophilic life forms that may exist elsewhere in the universe, adapted to life at low water activities. Likewise, hyperthermophilic microorganisms present on Earth in hot springs, hydrothermal vents and other sites heated by volcanic activity in terrestrial or marine areas, may resemble life forms that may exist on hot planets such as Venus.

Estimating growth rates for long-lived organisms, such as turtles, is challenging because it requires long sampling times for adequate growth rate estimation. Within the same species, growth can vary among populations due to variation in latitude, environmental conditions, diet, competition, genetics, and timing of sexual maturity. Here, we studied the somatic growth rates of male and female Common Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) from Spring Lake, Hays County, Texas, USA. We applied the Wang's modified von Bertalanffy Model to mark-recapture data of individuals with unknown age collected from 1995 to 2021. We found the growth trajectories to follow the patterns observed in other freshwater turtle species: juveniles exhibited a rapid growth rate and the growth slowed as individuals approached the assumed size of sexual maturity. Estimated growth coefficients were higher for females (k = 0.40) than males (k = 0.22). Female growth slowed significantly after the age of 12 or at a straight-line carapace length (SCL) of 275 mm. Male growth slowed at the age of 20 or at SCL of 312 mm. Although growth rates of C. serpentina have been widely studied, previous research focused mainly on northern populations. We estimated growth rates in a region where turtles are active year round, which aids in understanding the life-history traits of C. serpentina in the southern portion of their distribution.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				APR	2023	18	1					196	203																WOS:000986725500020

Exploring the application of blue and red thermoluminescence for dating volcanic glasses	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS												Tephras are significant markers in the stratigraphic record and play a key role in establishing paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate histories worldwide. Despite burgeoning research focused on tephra characterization and correlation techniques, there are still few techniques that allow for the direct dating of tephra, particularly below the lower age limit of K/Ar and Ar/Ar dating methods. In this study, we test different thermoluminescence (TL) dating approaches on the 4-11 mu m volcanic glass constituents of three different independently different tephras. By comparing against independent age control, we demonstrate the utility of both blue (320-450 nm) and red (587-651 nm) TL emissions for dating volcanic glasses using single aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose techniques. We find that both blue and red TL emissions from the volcanic glass shards are dim but reproducible and show no evidence for significant sensitivity changes occurring between the natural TL and the first test dose during the SAR protocol. Fading tests on the blue TL signal show that g-values range from 1.6 +/- 1.0 to 2.9 +/- 1.1%/decade and are statistically indistinguishable with zero at 2 sigma for the red TL. Bleaching experiments show that both blue and red TL signals are sensitive to light exposure, with sensitivity corrected signals declining by-40% over a 2-h period. For all three tephras, both the fading-corrected blue and red SAR-TL ages are consistent with age expectation. These successful results demonstrate the effectiveness of TL techniques for determining the eruption ages of tephra deposits in primary position between-1 and at least 30 ka.

The overall device dimensions were 6.00 in. x 1.62 in. x 5.32 in., and its total weight was 0.85 lbs., both well within the imposed constraints. The device functions by using a series of linkages, a rod, spring and block to translate the force enacted on a trigger to open two endeffector rings. When the trigger is disengaged, the device stays closed. The end effector rings are inlayed with an expandable Teflon that works in conjunction to enclose a 0.5"-2" sample. The expandable Teflon proved useful due to its superior strength and ability to stretch, allowing the device to encompass samples slightly larger than 2" while also being safe for lunar missions. The device's functionality was tested at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at NASA Johnson Space Center. Communication with the diver was done via Microsoft Teams. Once the diver entered the pool with the device, a few preliminary tests were completed. A grip test was performed where the diver ensured the trigger functioned properly in accordance with the rest of the device. Then, the diver was able to successfully capture and contain multiple samples of various sizes within the allotted time. The testing of the device showcased the unique attributes that the tool had to offer. Improvements to the device that will be considered include changing the material of the internal components to better resist oxidization, exploring different techniques to attach the ePTFE to Al-6061 and designing a more robust trigger for enhanced ergonomics.																					978-1-62410-610-1				2021																								WOS:001396224901053
J	Teranes, JL; McKenzie, JA				Teranes, JL; McKenzie, JA			Lacustrine oxygen isotope record of 20th-century climate change in central Europe:: evaluation of climatic controls on oxygen isotopes in precipitation	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We report oxygen isotope data from a 108-yr (1885-1993) sequence with annual laminae of bio-induced authigenic calcite in a frozen core from Baldeggersee, a small lake in Central Switzerland. These isotope results provide proxy data on the isotopic composition of past precipitation in the Baldeggersee catchment region and are quantitatively compared with instrumental climate data (i.e. mean annual air temperature and atmospheric circulation pattern indices) to evaluate climatic controls on oxygen isotopes in precipitation. Monitoring the isotope hydrology of Baldeggersee demonstrates that the oxygen isotopic composition of the lake water is controlled by the isotopic composition of local atmospheric precipitation (delta O-18(p)) and that the isotopic signal of precipitation is preserved, albeit damped, in the lake calcite oxygen isotope record (delta O-18(c)). Comparison of the calcite oxygen isotope proxy for delta O-18(p) in the catchment with historical mean annual air temperature measurements from Bern, Switzerland confirms that authigenic calcite reliably records past annual air temperature in the region. This delta O-18(c)/temperature relationship is calculated to be 0.39 parts per thousand/degreesC for the period 1900-1960, based on an isotope mass-balance model for Baldeggersee. An exception is a 0.8 parts per thousand anomalous negative shift in calcite delta O-18 values since the 1960s. Possible explanations for this recent delta O-18(c) shift, as it is not related to mean annual air temperature, include changes in delta O-18(p) due to synoptic circulation patterns. In particular, the 0.8 parts per thousand negative shift coincides with a trend towards a more dominant North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. This circulation pattern would tend to bring more isotopically more negative winter precipitation to the region and could account for the 0.8 parts per thousand offset in delta O-18(c) data.																			0921-2728					AUG	2001	26	2					131	146		10.1023/A:1011175701502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011175701502													WOS:000169620900002

The risks associated with below grade pipelines are typically assessed in detail as part of operators' pipeline integrity management program. However, the level of risk associated with above grade facilities and equipment is often not investigated to the same level. As part of an effort, with an anonymous pipeline operator, to refine the calculated risks associated with these facilities and valve sites, a focus was made on enhancing the consequence calculations with more accurate site-specific information. An approach was developed to assess whether smaller volume releases from these locations may impact nearby waterways following a release. The operator identified 150 sites throughout North America where releases had the potential to contaminate a waterbody. In order to confirm/disprove this potential impact to water, hypothetical releases of multiple hydrocarbon products were simulated using oil spill modeling tools to assess the potential overland and downstream transport and fates of the released products. Hypothetical release scenarios were simulated until all of the modeled oil had been released and had either adhered to the land surface, filled a depression in the land surface, and/or evaporated to the atmosphere; or when oil was predicted to enter a perennial waterbody (stream or lake). The goal was to assess the potential for each release to reach a waterbody. A single release was simulated for each site based on a historical maximum volume for a release associated with the specific equipment type (e.g. valves) that could be released over a 24-hour period. Releases were simulated using conditions selected to produce reasonable, conservative results to maximize the potential for the largest volume of oil to enter a waterbody. These conditions were based on the spring season, where rivers and streams would be under some of the highest flow conditions, intermittent streams and waterbodies would contain water feeding larger water bodies, cool air temperatures would reduce evaporative losses, and no snow cover maximize overland transport. This screening level analysis allowed for identification of each location's potential to reach a nearby waterbody under the conservative set of conditions and assumptions. By eliminating sites where oil would not reach a waterbody, the operator was able to focus efforts on the highest consequence areas in order to complete more detailed field-level analysis. In regard to spill modeling, more detailed analyses could be conducted in the future to predict the range of possible outcomes from other types of releases and using more site-specific and season-specific data. As an example. slower releases/leak rates. enhanced evaporative losses, a range of environmental conditions, and/or losses to infiltration could be assessed to bound the range of potential impacts.																			1537-6788		978-0-7918-8445-4				2020									V002T02A014															WOS:000850704700018

The experimental data base of the Esthwaite Water location, U.K., prepared in the international program on Validation of Model Predictions (VAMP) of IAEA/CEC, was used as a test scenario. Radiocesium enters the lake via: (1) a quick pulse of atmospheric deposition for 1-2 days; and (2) a lasting but smaller contribution from the catchment carried by the water runoff and the dragged sediments. An auxiliary model of the catchment was used to quantify these two source terms. The temporal evolution of the Cs-137 concentration in this lake after the contamination by the Chernobyl accident is modelled using a compartmental approach following the Codell model. The desorption/adsorption dynamics between water and sediments are considered both in the drainage water and in the lake boundary layer. The most important processes transferring contamination out of the lake water are adsorption of radioactivity by suspended sediments and their sedimentation; these processes are modelled through a distribution coefficient and through an aerial removal rate. Summer stratification is modelled introducing some auxiliary hypotheses. When using a priori probability distributions for the parameters based both on experimental evidence and on information from the literature the model simulates the observed radiocesium concentrations with an expected underprediction bias of 30% in the integrated concentrations in water. The concentration in sediments is inside the observed range in most of the runs. After the calibration of the model to the best fits observed with parameters inside their expected ranges, the bias decreases to -6% in the epilimnion, 8% in the hypolimnion and -4.4% in sediments, with an unexplained variance of +3.2%, +3% and +1%, respectively.																			0169-7722					JUN	1993	13	1-4					183	211		10.1016/0169-7722(93)90057-Y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-7722(93)90057-Y													WOS:A1993LM27800012

Calculation and visualisation of future glacier extent in the Swiss Alps by means of hypsographic modelling	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The observed rapid glacier wastage in the European Alps during the past 20 years already has strong impacts on the natural environment (rock fall, lake formation) as well as on human activities (tourism, hydro-power production, etc.) and poses several new challenges also for glacier monitoring. With a further increase of global mean temperature in the future, it is likely that Alpine glaciers and the high-mountain environment as an entire system will further develop into a state of imbalance. Hence, the assessment of future glacier geometries is a valuable prerequisite for various impact studies. In order to calculate and Visualize in a consistent manner future glacier extent for a large number of individual glaciers (> 100) according to a given climate change scenario, we have developed an automated and simple but robust approach that is based on an empirical relationship between glacier size and the steady-state accumulation area ratio (AAR(0)) in the Alps. The model requires digital glacier outlines and a digital elevation model (DEM) only and calculates new glacier geometries from a given shift of the steady-state equilibrium line altitude (ELA(0)) by means of hypsographic modelling. We have calculated changes in number, area and volume for 3062 individual glacier units in Switzerland and applied six step changes in ELA(0) (from + 100 to + 600 in) combined with four different values of the AAR(0) (0.5, 0.6, 0.67, 0.75). For an AAR(0) of 0.6 and an ELA(0) rise of 200 in (400 in) we calculate a total area loss of -54% (-80%) and a corresponding volume loss of -50% (-78%) compared to the 1973 glacier extent. In combination with a geocoded satellite image, the future glacier outlines are also used for automated rendering of perspective visualisations. This is a very attractive tool for communicating research results to the general public. Our study is illustrated for a test site in the Upper Engadine (Switzerland), where landscape changes above timberline play an important role for the local economy. The model is seen as a first-step approach, where several parts can be (and should be) further developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the P/C (protein/carbohydrate) ratio appears to be a relatively sensitive index integrating all metabolic functions of the cells. It responded well to variations of light level, temperature, nutrient supplies, hydrodynamic conditions and algal species composition. In addition, the coupling of P/C and N/P ratios along the three studied stations A, B and C allowed a discrimination of three types of ecosystems. Station A is a distinct riverine zone characterized by flow and mixing. It is followed by station B which is a transitional zone. Station C located near the dam is the most lake-like. This would imply that Microcystis cells are station-specific. The chemical composition of water and mainly the variations of N/P ratios are the deterministic factors of the mass occurrence of Microcystis aeruginosa. The summer growth phases of this species observed both sampling years started as soon as N/P levels decreased below 5. The proliferation of Microcystis did not seem to be regulated by biological factors. Any manipulation to lower N-inputs will translate into low N/P ratios allowing Microcystis to become dominant. A first step in the restoration of the Villerest reservoir passes through a dephosphoryzation of tributaries. In addition, in station C in order to limit the diffusive fluxes of phosphorus from the sediment, an appropriate management of the water gates of the dam should be attempted.																			0003-9136					JAN	1996	135	3					337	359																WOS:A1996TT86100003

The growth of halophytes will be stressed when their salt content reaches the threshold. In this study, the pot experiments were conducted and Suaeda salsa, a typical halophyte, was selected as the object to explore the relationship between growth characteristics and salt content under different soil salinity gradients. Salinity gradients were set according to the maximum soil salinity in the current years of Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR). They were classified using the following threshold values: <= 2 g/kg (Control Group), 10 g/kg, 20 g/kg, 30 g/kg, and 40 g/kg. The original spectrum, trilateral position and growth characteristics were used as indexes for analysis. With the increase of soil salt content, the red edge shift occurs first, followed by the blue edge shift. The position of yellow edge, green peak and blue edge were not sensitive with the change of soil salinity. This indicates that the red edge is the best indicator for evaluating plant growth. Compared with the Control Group, when the salt content is less than 10 g/kg, the growth status of plant seems not significantly affected. However, plant growth begins to be stressed when the salt content increases to 20 g/kg, which is a turning point for plant health. The increase of soil salt content can inhibit chlorophyll synthesis and plant growth. Plants begin to die when the salt content reaches the 40 g/kg. Therefore, 40 g/kg could be regarded as the critical point of salt content which inhibits plant growth. The study also shows that the relationship between plant-height change rate and soil salt content is the most significant, indicating that the plant-height change rate is significantly impacted by soil salt content.

A molecular isotope record of climate variability and vegetation response in southwestern North America during mid-Pleistocene glacial/interglacial cycles	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Climate variability during Pleistocene glacial/interglacial transitions is well documented in marine and ice-sheet isotopic records, but terrestrial records showing the continental response to these transitions are scarce, especially for earlier in the Pleistocene. Cyclic intervals of warm interglacial and cold glacial conditions preserved in terrestrial records such as lake sediments provide opportunities to probe the biosphere's response to climate change. In this study, we track climate and plant type changes, specifically the presence of C3 and C4 plants, using the abundance and delta C-13 signatures of leaf waxes in paleolacustrine sediments from Valles Caldera in New Mexico. Through these changes, we assess the response of vegetation to climate variability in southwestern North America through two mid -Pleistocene glacial/interglacial transitions (Marine Isotope Stage [MIS] 14/13 and 12/11). Leaf wax data show that the 0 forest taxa were dominant through the entire record whereas C4 plants, better adapted to warm conditions and competitive under water stress, are favored during warming and extended arid periods during interglacials. The delta C-13 signature in leaf wax n-alkanes suggests that C4 plants persisted in the watershed throughout the interglacials and that some summer rainfall (which is required to support C4 grasses) was maintained even during prolonged dry periods. The abundance and carbon isotope composition of leaf waxes together with new MBT/CBT (methylation index of branched tetraethers/cyclization index of branched tetraethers) temperature data confirm warmer and more arid conditions during MIS 13 than during MIS 11, in spite of relatively low greenhouse gas concentrations during MIS 13. This suggests that variations in incoming solar radiation have played a major role in regulating the surface temperature, regional hydrological systems and vegetation in southwestern North America, likely through changes in the North American Monsoon coupled with variations in the location of the mid-latitude westerlies.

Among the total coliform, Spirillum, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella, Sarcina cocci, and Enterococcus were detected in the water sources of Sunukul and Snow samples. The Faecal coliform and the E. coli counts exceeding acceptable limits are indicative of pollution from natural and anthropogenic. The study concludes that some water sources in tropics do not meet the potable water standards according to MPC (2003) and WHO (1998); hence, there can be potential sources of waterborne diseases. The study stresses that the point-of-use water sources' disinfection is thus necessary. In this purpose, we suggested some promising suitable disinfection technological methods for this area such as Automatic Variable Filtration (AVF) technology, Chlorination, Ultraviolet Radiation, Ultrasound, and Ozonation.

Long-term monitoring in the boreal forest reveals high spatio-temporal variability among primary ecosystem constituents	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The boreal forest, the world's largest terrestrial biome, is undergoing dramatic changes owing to anthropogenic stressors, including those of climate change. To track terrestrial ecosystem changes through space and time, robust monitoring programs are needed that survey a variety of ecosystem constituents. We monitored white spruce (Picea glauca) cone crops, berry (Empetrum nigrum, Shepherdia canadensis) production, above-ground mushroom abundance, and the abundance of small mammals (Clethrionomys rutilus, Peromyscus maniculatus), North American red squirrels (Tamiascirus hudsonicus), snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), and carnivores (Lynx canadensis, Canis latrans, Vulpes vulpes, Martes americana, Mustela erminea) across 5 sites in the Yukon, Canada. Monitoring began in 1973 at Lhu'aan Man' (Kluane Lake) and additional protocols were added until a complete sequence was fixed in 2005 at all 5 sites and continued until 2022. White spruce cone counts show mast years at 3-7-year intervals. Ground berries and soapberry counts were highly variable among sites and counts did not correlate among sites or between years for different species. Red-backed voles showed clear 3-4-year cycles at Kluane and probably at the Mayo and Watson Lake sites, but showed only annual cycles in Whitehorse and Faro. Snowshoe hares fluctuated in 9-10-year cycles in a travelling wave, peaking one year earlier at Watson Lake but in synchrony at all other sites, with no clear sign of peak density changing or cyclic attenuation over the last 50 years. Red squirrel numbers at Kluane exhibit marked inter-year variability, driven mainly by episodic white spruce cone crops and predation from Canada lynx and coyotes as hare densities undergo cyclic decline. Snow track counts to index mammalian predators have been conducted on our Kluane and Mayo sites, indicating that lynx numbers rise and fall with a 1-2-year lag at these two sites, tracking the hare cycle. Coyotes and lynx at Kluane peak together following the hare cycle, but coyote counts are also depressed during deep snow years. To summarize, we noted considerable inter-site variability in the population dynamics of many boreal forest ecosystem constituents, but the keystone species (snowshoe hare, Canada lynx) exhibit remarkably similar population trends across the region. We continue to monitor wildlife abundance, cone crops, berry production, and mushroom biomass to determine changes associated with increasing temperature and fluctuating rainfall. The Yukon boreal forest is changing as climate shifts, but the changes are slow, variable across sites, taxa specific, and of uncertain predictability.

Digestive tract contents and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in breast muscles of these birds were analyzed to assess the effect of driftnets on the trophic relationships of marine birds. The diets of Sooty (Puffinus griseus) and Short-tailed (P. tenuirostris) Shearwaters associated with high seas driftnets in the transitional region of the North Pacific Ocean over lap broadly. The principal differences between them include 1) Sooties prey more heavily on immature stages of invertebrates, especially the barnacle Lepas fascicularis than do Short-tails, 2) Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) are the primary fish taken by Sooties while lanternfish (Myctophidae) are the primary fish taken by Short-tails, and 3) Sooties lake a wider variety of prey than do Short-tails. During the last years of extensive high seas driftnet fishing (early 1990's), both shearwaters augmented their diets with about 15% offal and discards from fishing vessels. Values for stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in breast muscle tissues (delta(15)N and delta(15)C) indicate the extent and timing of movements of Sooty Shearwaters: including arrival of migrants from the south Pacific (April-May), east to west movement from the eastern Pacific (May-June), and west to east movement from Japan (August-September). Fall migrant Sooties were not detected. The only movements of Short-tails that ive detected were a few south-bound migrants in September-November.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2000	23	2					165	186																WOS:000089097300003
J	White, JDL				White, JDL			Pre-emergent construction of a lacustrine basaltic volcano, Pahvant Butte, Utah (USA)	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The subaqueous phases of an eruption initiated approximately 85 m beneath the surface of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville produced a broad mound of tephra. A variety of distinctive lithofacies allows reconstruction of the eruptive and depositional processes active prior to emergence of the volcano above lake level. At the base of the volcano and very near inferred vent sites are fines-poor, well-bedded, broadly scoured beds of sideromelane tephra having local very low-angle cross-stratification (Mi lithofacies). These beds grade upward into lithofacies M3, which shows progressively better developed dunes and cross-stratification upsection to its uppermost exposure approximately 10 m below syneruptive lake level. Both lithofacies were emplaced largely by traction from relatively dilute sediment gravity flows generated during eruption. Intercalated lithofacies are weakly bedded tuff and breccia (M2), and nearly structureless units with coarse basal layers above strongly erosional contacts (M4). The former combines products of deposition from direct fall and moderate concentration sediment gravity flows, and the latter from progressively aggrading high-concentration sediment gravity flows. Early in the eruption subaqueous tephra jetting from phreatomagmatic explosions discontinuously fed inhomogeneous, unsteady, dilute density currents which produced the M1 lithofacies near the vent. Dunes and crossbeds which are better developed upward in M3 resulted from interaction between sediment gravity flows and surface waves triggered as the explosion-generated pressure waves and eruption jets impinged upon and occasionally breached the surface. Intermingling of (a) tephra emplaced after brief transport by tephra jets within a gaseous milieu and (b) laterally flowing tephra formed lithofacies M2 along vent margins during parts of the eruption in which episodes of continuous uprush produced localized water-exclusion zones above a vent. M4 comprises mass now deposits formed by disruption and remobilization of mound tephra. Intermittent, explosive magma-water interactions occurred from the outset of the Pahvant eruption, with condensation, entrainment of water and lateral now marking the transformation from eruptive to ''sedimentary'' processes leading to deposition of the mound lithofacies.

Molecular phylogenetics reveals convergent evolution in lower Congo River spiny eels	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: The lower Congo River (LCR) is a region of exceptional species diversity and endemism in the Congo basin, including numerous species of spiny eels (genus Mastacembelus). Four of these exhibit distinctive phenotypes characterized by greatly reduced optic globes deeply embedded into the head (cryptophthalmia) and reduced (or absent) melanin pigmentation, among other characteristics. A strikingly similar cryptophthalmic phenotype is also found in members of a number of unrelated fish families, strongly suggesting the possibility of convergent evolution. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes that shaped diversification in LCR Mastacembelus, their biogeographic origins, or when colonization of the LCR occurred. Methods: We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes from Mastacembelus species collected in the lower Congo River, and compared them with other African species and Asian representatives as outgroups. We analyzed the sequence data using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Results: Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, and Bayesian coalescent methods for species tree reconstruction, reveal that endemic LCR spiny eels derive from two independent origins, clearly demonstrating convergent evolution of the cryptophthalmic phenotype. Mastacembelus crassus, M. aviceps, and M. simbi form a clade, allied to species found in southern, eastern and central Africa. Unexpectedly, M. brichardi and brachyrhinus fall within a clade otherwise endemic to Lake Tanganikya (LT) ca. 1500 km east of the LCR. Divergence dating suggests the ages of these two clades of LCR endemics differ markedly. The age of the crassus group is estimated at similar to 4 Myr while colonization of the LCR by the brichardi-brachyrhinus progenitor was considerably more recent, dated at similar to 0.5 Myr. Conclusions: The phylogenetic framework of spiny eels presented here, the first to include LCR species, demonstrates that cryptophthalmia and associated traits evolved at least twice in Mastacembelus: once in M. brichardi and at least once in the M. crassus clade. Timing of diversification is broadly consistent with the onset of modern high-energy flow conditions in the LCR and with previous studies of endemic cichlids. The close genetic relationship between M. brichardi and M. brachyrhinus is particularly notable given the extreme difference in phenotype between these species, and additional work is needed to better understand the evolutionary history of diversification in this clade. The findings presented here demonstrate strong, multi-trait convergence in LCR spiny eels, suggesting that extreme selective pressures have shaped numerous phenotypic attributes of the endemic species of this region.

In this study, a series of Al-doped modified metal-organic frameworks (Zr-Al-MOF) were prepared by solvothermal method, which achieved efficient removal of phosphate and arsenate in water. Due to the use of inexpensive Al salts, the material has a lower cost and is more economical. The molar ratio of metal salts, adsorption time, solution pH, initial concentration, temperature and coexisting anions were studied, and it was found that when the molar ratio of Zr: Al was 2, Zr-Al-MOF had the best adsorption performance for phosphate and arsenate, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 93.04 mg P/g and 173.83 mg As/g, respectively. It traps phosphate and arsenate at a fast reaction rate and can be recycled repeatedly. In addition, 0.15 g/L of 2Zr-Al-MOF can effectively reduce the phosphate and arsenate content in the contaminated spring water samples of Yangzonghai Lake to the standard range of drinking water, which further confirms the application potential of 2Zr-Al-MOF. By FT-IR and XPS analysis, it was found that the adsorption mechanism was ligand exchange, electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond formation. The theoretical calculation shows that the adsorption energy is negative, which indicates that 2Zr-Al-MOF is attractive to phosphate and arsenate, and the adsorption state is stable. The results show that 2Zr-Al-MOF is an effective phosphate and arsenate adsorbent and has broad application prospects in eutrophication water treatment.					yang, xiangjun/E-6195-2019														1001-0742	1878-7320				FEB	2026	160									10.1016/j.jes.2025.04.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2025.04.054		SEP 2025											WOS:001583638900003
J	GENTER, RB; AMYOT, DJ				GENTER, RB; AMYOT, DJ			FRESH-WATER BENTHIC ALGAL POPULATION AND COMMUNITY CHANGES DUE TO ACIDITY AND ALUMINUM-ACID MIXTURES IN ARTIFICIAL STREAMS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Communities of freshwater benthic algae were exposed to water acidified daily to Ph 4.8 alone and in mixtures with 50, 100, or 500 mug L-1 Al. Daily acidification to nominal pH 4.8 in acidified treatments exposed algae to a range of pHs that led to a variety of Al species of different toxicity. Calcium concentrations in stream water were higher in acidified and Al treatments on day 1, and dissolved Al in stream water was higher in the highest Al treatment on days 1, 7, and 28; otherwise acid and Al treatments did not significantly alter Al and Ca in the exposure water. Calcium bioaccumulation by periphyton was lower in acidified and Al treatments on all sampling days. Concentrations of Mg in water and periphyton did not differ between treatments. The artificial stream system generated alkalinity to buffer acidified water; the amount of generated alkalinity returned to approximately the same levels for the first week, but the amount of alkalinity generated during the second week appeared to decline, and acid-only and acid-Al mixtures diverged in their ability to generate alkalinity during the third and fourth weeks. Aluminum in acidified water inhibited abundance of diatoms and green and blue-green algae more than the effects of acid stress alone. The green filamentous alga Mougeotia showed a slight (but not statistically significant) increase in abundance in the acid-only treatment. The middle-Al treatment (nominally 100 mug L-1 Al and acid) generated more alkalinity and had higher abundance of some algal taxa on days 14 and 28, even though measured Al concentrations in water and periphyton fell between low- and high-Al-treatment levels. Community-level tests, combining a taxonomic analysis of algal population abundance with chemical analysis of water and bioaccumulation, provide valuable insight to assess anthropogenic stress.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAR	1994	13	3					369	380		10.1002/etc.5620130303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620130303													WOS:A1994NA76100003

CH4 concentrations elevated above the background level were observed over areas with wetlands and wildfires, important sources of CH4. Several flights showed elevated CH4 values, with corresponding delta(CH4)-C-13 and delta CH4 signatures of -63.4% +/- 3.0 parts per thousand and -424 parts per thousand +/- 79 parts per thousand, respectively, which are based on the relationship between delta(CH4)-C-13 (or delta DCH4) and CH4 concentration (single mixing relation), an indication of wetland source. It was also noted that both wetlands and wildfires influenced the CH4 concentrations observed over the wildfire area. Assuming certain emission ratios of CH4 to CO (ERCH4/CO) for the wildfire and certain values of delta(CH4)-C-13 and delta D-CH4 for wetland CH4, we derived delta(CH4)-C-13 and delta D-CH4 of CH4 emitted from the wildfire to be -27.5 parts per thousand +/- 2.0 parts per thousand and -285 parts per thousand +/- 111 parts per thousand, respectively, which agreed relatively well with, but was slightly lower than, those obtained by previous studies at lower latitudes. To verify these estimates, bonfire experiments were conducted in the interior of Alaska using the same biomass material burned in the wildfire observed by the aircraft. The result showed that the previously reported ERCH4/CO value was plausible and that delta(CH4)-C-13 and delta D-CH4 obtained by the bonfire experiments agreed with the estimates by the aircraft observations. We also found that delta(CH4)-C-13 and delta D-CH4 values became enriched with increasing combustion efficiency. By using the relationship between delta D-CH4 for biomass burning and delta D of precipitation, global average of delta D-CH4 emitted from biomass burning was estimated to be -204 parts per thousand +/- 11 parts per thousand.

J	Johnson, CJ; Parker, KL; Heard, DC; Gillingham, MP				Johnson, CJ; Parker, KL; Heard, DC; Gillingham, MP			A multiscale behavioral approach to understanding the movements of woodland caribou	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We assessed the response of woodland caribou (Rang fer tarandus caribou) to land-cover type, predation risk, energetic costs of movement, and patch configuration at multiple spatial scales. We applied a nonlinear model to frequent locations collected with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by caribou found in forested and alpine (above tree line) habitats. We differentiated intra- from interpatch movements and identified collections of patches (multiple-patch scale) where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. On average, intra- and interpatch movements were 450.7 and 1268.8 m, respectively, and multiple-patch movements occurred over an area of 182 ha. Intrapatch movements were highly correlated, indicative of a strong relationship between behavior and place. Caribou in the forest selected patches of Pine terrace, whereas caribou in the alpine selected patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover. Predation risk was not a factor influencing movements of caribou at the intrapatch scale. Selection of cover types was more variable during interpatch movements. At that scale, caribou selected patches of Pine terrace, Lakes/rivers, Alpine-little vegetative cover, and Alpine-grass. The routes selected by caribou had lower energetic costs relative to surrounding terrain, and during some winters, caribou were subjected to higher levels of predation risk during those movements. At the multiple-patch scale, selection was more specific and encompassed patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover, Alpine-grass, and Pine terrace. Predation risk was relatively unimportant at the multi-patch scale, but animals that moved from forested to alpine habitats reduced their relative risk of predation. Patch configuration was a poor predictor of those areas where caribou concentrated intrapatch movements. There was some evidence of caribou selecting patches of Pine terrace within a matrix of Wetlands and Pine-black spruce/black spruce patches. Caribou in the alpine avoided patches of Alpine-little vegetative cover adjacent to forest types. Our results indicate that forest managers should maintain widely distributed patches of Pine terrace and implement silvicultural regimes that do not stimulate predator populations across areas used for interpatch movements.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2002	12	6					1840	1860		10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1840:AMBATU]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1840:AMBATU]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000179986700020

Freshwater plumes and brackish lakes: Integrated microfossil and O-C-Sr isotopic evidence from the late Miocene and early Pliocene Bouse Formation (California-Arizona) supports a lake overflow model for the integration of the lower Colorado River corridor	GEOSPHERE												Uncertainty over the depositional environment of the late Miocene and early Pliocene Bouse Formation hinders our understanding the evolution of the lower Colorado River corridor. Competing marine and lacustrine models for the origin of the southern Bouse Formation remain extremely difficult to reconcile after neariy 60 yr of study. This paper compares new microfossil data, inorganic and biologic carbonate delta O-18 and delta C-13 values (relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite), and carbonate and fish bone Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from northern and southern outcrops of the Bouse Formation. The lacustrine northern Bouse Formation and the contested southern Bouse Formation share a core Cyprideis (mixed marginal marine), Limnocythere (continental), and Candona (continental) ostracode assemblage, indicating similar environmental conditions. Micrite and ostracode valves from both areas yield neariy identical ?O-18 and delta C-13 values, suggesting similar origins. Ostracode valves from both areas document a large and abrupt shift from high delta O-18 values (2 parts per thousand) to low values (-10 parts per thousand), consistent with fill-and-spill lacustrine origins. Tests of the planktic foraminifer Streptochilus from a southern outcrop yielded delta O-18 and delta C-13 values that are neariy identical to benthic ostracode delta O-18 and delta C-13 values. Recognition of benthic Streptochilus weakens a categorically marine interpretation for the southern Bouse Formation. Barnacle shell fragments at a key outcrop of the southern Bouse Formation that preserves sigmoidal bedding with possible spring-to-neap tidal bundling yielded low delta O-18 values (-8 parts per thousand +/- 1 parts per thousand) that are incompatible with calcification in seawater. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from co-occurring fish bones (0.71104) and ostracode valves (0.71100) and the surrounding micrite (0.71086) reveal an isotopically complex lacustrine depositional environment for the southern Bouse Formation. A model invoking freshwater plumes from the early Colorado River into either a terminal or a tidally influenced, mildly brackish lake followed by an abrupt transition to a freshwater lake provides a comprehensive and internally consistent explanation for the microfossil and isotopic complexities observed in this southern Bouse Formation data set. A freshwater plume model is entirely consistent with fill-and-spill models for the downward integration of the eariy Colorado River.																			1553-040X					AUG	2018	14	4					1875	1911		10.1130/GES01610.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES01610.1													WOS:000440187300023

However, some taxa can be found far above this limit, sometimes on isolated oceanic islands, implying long-term survival in subglacial subterranean refugia. Here we report a peculiar assemblage comprising two new depigmented and blind (stygomorphic) amphipods from the subarctic ancient lake El'gygytgyn (northern Far East): Palearcticarellus hyperboreus sp. nov. and Pseudocrangonyx elgygytgynicus sp. nov. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on five markers confirm their affinity to Crangonyctidae and Pseudocrangonyctidae, respectively. Fossil-calibrated molecular dating indicates that the ages of both species predate the onset of Pleistocene glaciations by at least an order of magnitude. Although both species are clearly adapted for subterranean life and are related to groundwater taxa, they are only known from the lake waters (5-170-m depth). Despite being nested within Pseudocrangonyctidae, P. elgygytgynicus has an atypical third uropod that preserves a vestigial inner ramus, a trait characteristic to the monotypic sister family Crymostygidae. Given that this character was the main distinguishing feature between the two families, we propose merging Crymostygidae with Pseudocrangonyctidae. Our findings represent the world's northernmost record of stygomorphic amphipods, emphasising their relictual biogeography and the importance of Lake El'gygytgyn as a long-term, high latitude refugium for ancient pre-glacial fauna.ZooBank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3A51D1F8-E65D-4A3A-B663-D5C40272E68B					Copilas-Ciocianu, Denis/F-1956-2011; Bashkuev, Alexey/AGT-3561-2022; Sidorov, Dmitry/L-9664-2016; Shkil, Fedor/AAJ-4030-2020	Copilas-Ciocianu, Denis/0000-0002-6374-2365; 													1445-5226	1447-2600					2024	38	12							IS24001	10.1071/IS24001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS24001								39652437					WOS:001372217700001
J	Sobolev, AI				Sobolev, Anton, I			IMPROVING RELIABILITY OF ONOMASTIC ETYMOLOGY (With Reference to the Southeastern Lake Onega Region)	VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS												The paper addresses the problem of improving reliability of onomastic etymologies using the example of historical and modern personal and place names of southeastern Lake Onega region. The issue is pertinent, as specialists form other fields (c.f. historians and ethnologists) take little account of onomastic research where serious studies and quasi-scientific works presenting unverified data are sometimes difficult to separate. The paper provides examples of erroneous etymologies of personal and place names. Wrong etymologization can occur due to the neglect of written sources (the person named Shestak living in the village of Shestovo, or Terenty living in Terovo) or processes of phonetic adaptation in language contacts (Tyug- from Vepsian tuhj 'empty,' not from tuug 'spring sowing'). Another cause is the use of unverified written sources that might include invalid variants of names due to their misspelling or incorrect rendering (Kosach instead of Kagach, Saminskoye instead of Salminskoye). Tangly ethnic and linguistic contexts, such as heterogeneity of topobases (Goik-) or the widespread prevalence of appellatives (Kubas), can also result in etymological mistakes as some name variants may be underinformative and misleading. The author offers a complex approach for improving reliability of onomastic etymologies based on 1) expanding the source base and making comparative research of the collected data, 2) using the data of historical phonetics and phonetic adaptation in contacting languages, 3) emphasizing the so-called "exact" etymologies, 4) comparing local toponymic and anthroponymic data with onomastic evidence from other regions, 5) identifying toponyms with a greater differentiating linguistic potential, 6) eliminating bias which include etymologies accommodated to a specific language.																			1994-2400	1994-2451					2021	18	3					9	40		10.15826/vopr_onom.2021.18.3.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.15826/vopr_onom.2021.18.3.031													WOS:000864738500001

Microbialite cathodoluminescence: A tool for investigating palaeoredox conditions, alteration histories and primary textures across time	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												Microbialites have long been utilised by geologists as palaeoenvironmental indicators, despite outstanding questions regarding their formation and preservation in the rock record. Here, we leverage cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy, a technique commonly used to investigate carbonate formation and diagenetic alteration, to better understand the textural characteristics, formation mechanisms and diagenetic histories of microbialites. We compare CL features to gain insight into palaeoredox conditions and alteration histories for a suite of six microbialite samples spanning from the Proterozoic to modern, finding a strong degree of similarity amongst samples regardless of age or depositional environment. CL reveals that microbialites typically have complex microfabrics that include other accessory minerals and grains, all of which provide insight into their unique formation and palaeoredox histories. We find that the modern microbialite sample showed the greatest difference in CL characteristics compared to the other microbialite samples, most probably because of its aragonitic composition and incomplete lithification. In contrast, the ancient microbialite samples preserve a distinct and most probably primary, mottled luminescence texture despite spanning more than 500 Myr; this mottled texture may typify ancient microbialite fabrics that formed in shallow water settings. We also distinguish a variety of CL characteristics that support previously proposed formation and/or diagenetic histories in these samples. Lastly, we use energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to compositionally identify rare grains observed with CL, highlighting the utility of CL as a possible screening tool for both geological and non-geological components within samples. Our analyses demonstrate the power of using classic CL techniques to answer modern questions in microbialite research.

Morphology and Distribution of Bubble-Supported Microbial Mats From Ice-Covered Antarctic Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Gas bubbles directly influence the macromorphology of benthic microbial mats resulting in preservable biosedimentary structures. This study characterizes the morphology and distribution of microbial mats growing in gas-supersaturated, perennially ice-covered lakes Fryxell, Joyce, and Hoare of the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Photosynthetic benthic mats within the gas-supersaturated zone trap oxygen-rich bubbles and become buoyant, tearing off the bottom as "liftoff mats." These liftoff mats form a succession of morphologies starting with bubble-induced deformation of flat mats into tent, ridge, and finger liftoff mat. With progressive deformation, mats tear, forming sheet liftoff, while multiple cycles of deformation and tearing transform sheet into strip liftoff. Some mats detach from the substrate and float to the underside of the ice. The depth range of the liftoff zone has varied over time at each lake. Downslope expansion of bubble formation brings previously bubble-free, deep-water pinnacle mats into the liftoff zone. When the liftoff zone shallows, liftoff mats at the deeper end deflate and can become scaffolding for additional mat growth. The superposition and relative orientation of liftoff and pinnacle mats can be used to track the maximum depth of the liftoff zone and changes in gas saturation state in these lakes through time. Our results demonstrate that gas bubbles, even when they are transitory, can exert a significant impact on the morphology of microbial mats at larger scales. This provides a way to identify similar structures and gas supersaturated environments in the biosedimentary record.					; Sumner, Dawn/E-8744-2011	Mackey, Tyler/0000-0001-6377-3797; Sumner, Dawn/0000-0002-7343-2061													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2025	130	3							e2024JG008516	10.1029/2024JG008516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008516													WOS:001449441300001
J	Li, ZY; Li, BK; He, MY; Wen, XQ; Di Zhou, J				Li, Zheng Yan; Li, Bin Kai; He, Mao-Yong; Wen, Xue Qin; Di Zhou, Jiang			The source of lithium in Lakkor Co Salt Lake on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China: evidence from hydrochemical characteristics and boron isotope	ACTA GEOCHIMICA												The availability of lithium resources is of great significance for the development of modern technologies, as well as for civil and military industries. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a region known for its abundance of lithium-rich salt lakes. However, the specific origin of lithium in these lakes is still unknown, which hinders the advancement of the lithium resource business in this region. To research this issue, this study involved the collection of 20 samples from Lakkor Co Salt Lake on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, encompassing samples of surface brine, cold springs, fresh lakes, and recharge rivers. The composition of anions and cations in these samples was determined. Furthermore, the analysis extensively utilized the Piper three-line diagram, Gibbs model, and ion proportion coefficient. The findings of this study indicate that as the moves from the recharge water system to salt lake, there is a transition in water type from strong carbonate to moderate carbonate and weak carbonate, as well as Na sulfate. This research based on a similar source of both lithium and boron, utilized ion correlation analysis and boron isotope study in the Lakkor Co area, and analyzed the source and transporting process of lithium. The main origin of lithium in Lakkor Co is the dissolution of lithium-rich rocks, recharge water systems, and deep hydrothermal fluids. These findings are highly significant in enhancing the foundational data of lithium-rich brine resources in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and are beneficial for assessing the future development of such deposits.

J	LI, MQ; YANG, T				LI, MQ; YANG, T			STUDIES OF INTERNAL HIRUDINIASIS IN HUMAN BODIES IN WESTERN ALGERIA	ACTA ZOOLOGICA SINICA												Patients (76) suffering from internal hirudiniasis of the nose, pharynx, larynx and trachea were treated in Algeria. The specimens collected in Algeria in Aug. 1976 are identified as Limnatis nilotica Savigny, 1822, now deposited in the Institute of Hydrobiology, Academia Sinica. Geographically, the climate of Saida is subtropical. The area is very hilly, with no rivers or lakes; drinking water comes only from mountain springs and brooks. Herdsmen and peasants usually drink unboiled water. Massive reproduction of leeches in July-Sept. probably explains the high occurrence of internal hirudiniasis in the area. The 76 worms varied greatly in size and shape. For the sake of clinical analysis, they were divided into 3 groups: larvae, intermediate worms and adult worms. The adults and the intermediate worms were probably able to enter the body via the path of drinking water in 42 cases. The clinical manifestations depended upon the size of the worm, the affected organs and the age of the patients. Of the 76 cases, 5 had hemorrhagic anemia and 2 had laryngeal obstructions; 21 had 1 or 2 red wounds (jaw wounds) on the pharyngeal mucosa from which the worms had migrated. The wounds remained open for .apprx. 1 wk. These jaw wounds are characteristic signs for the diagnosis of the disease. The ability of the leeches to react to outside stimuli is related to the quantity of blood ingested by them. In leeches with a greatly swollen body, their sucking ability is weak so that they can easily be extracted with forceps. While the patient is sitting, care should be taken not to let the forceps slip; otherwise the leech may drop into the larynx, causing the patient to suffocate.																			0001-7302						1982	28	4					377	382																WOS:A1982QD19000010

The subaerially generated pyroclastic-debris flow rapidly debouched into the shallow-marine environment. The flow formed a wedge-shaped deposit, up to 3.5 m thick, that is mappable over several square kilometers. Thickness and maximum clast size decrease offshore; near the distal margins the debris flow mixed with seawater and became a high-density shelf turbidity current, Where emplaced above storm wave base, the deposit was locally reworked to form a thin lag conglomerate.

The rhyodacite chemical and mineral composition, regional geologic setting, and thickness and clast-size variations indicate a nearby highly explosive calcalkaline volcanic source to the northeast (i.e., Western Cascade are). This deposit documents the earliest known Cascade are explosive event that directly affected sedimentation in the Tertiary forearc basin of western Oregon. A sanidine- and biotite-bearing ash fall tuff 3 m above the debris-flow deposit was derived from a backarc eruptive source (e,g., Oligocene John Day Formation). This tuff yielded an 40Ar/39Ar date of 29.83 Ma. The well-preserved diatom flora within the debris-flow deposit matrix extends the geologic range of some genera (e.g., Gomphonems) and widens the geographic distribution of others (e.g., Gomphopleura). Possible scenarios to explain the presence of exclusively freshwater diatoms in the debris-flow deposit in this shallow-marine section include: (1) a primary pyroclastic debris flow may have passed through a diatom-rich lake between the site of eruption and its entrance into the sea; (2) freshly erupted pyroclastics temporarily blocked a river drainage, creating an alpine lake that produced the debris flow upon dam failure; (3) primary pyroclastic debris may have been vented directly through a caldera or crater lake rich in diatomaceous sediment.

Mg-rich smectites, mainly associated with alkaline and evaporitic depositional conditions, are formed in environments such as salt lakes, brine springs, and sabkhas, as well as in hydrothermal systems, in some cases by transformation from other phyllosilicates. Saponite has also been documented on the surface of Mars. The systems that produce Mg-smectites are less common than those that produce dioctahedral Al-smectites and consequently Mg-rich smectites are less abundant than dioctahedral smectites. For this reason, information on nanoscale mineralogy and crystal chemistry of Mg-smectites is relatively lacking. In this study, X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and electron microscopy were used to study Mg-smectites. The crystal chemistry of single crystals determined with analytical electron microscopy in transmission electron microscopy (AEM-TEM) revealed that all samples had notable variability in the composition of individual crystals, such that no point analysis resulted in ideal structural formulae for saponite, stevensite, sepiolite, or palygorskite. They contain SiO2 content greater than that corresponding to a Mg-smectite, even stevensite, and often are intermediate to Mg-smectites and the sepiolite-palygorskite series. Meanwhile, the number of octahedral cations is small for fibrous clay minerals. Neither the point analysis of smectitic particles nor the mean structural formula fit properly for Mg-smectites showing crystallochemistry complexity. The results of these point analyses, in which no contamination has been observed, suggest that these smectites have intermediate compositions between trioctahedral smectites and sepiolite-palygorskite, indicating nanometer-scale intergrowths of these minerals in Mg-rich clay deposits.					; Suárez, Mercedes/J-3010-2012	Garcia-Romero, Emilia/0000-0002-9370-2823; Suarez, Mercedes/0000-0002-5426-2300; 													0009-8604	1552-8367				JAN 17	2025	73								e4	10.1017/cmn.2024.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cmn.2024.35													WOS:001399170400001
J	Sulyok, J				Sulyok Judit			The role of the natural environment in waterside travel destinations	TER ES TARSADALOM												Waterside destinations make up the bulk of world tourism. Travellers of the post-mass-tourism era seek new and authentic experiences. This implies new challenges for waterside destinations, too. During the development of high quality services, new attractions and repositioning, the natural environment often takes second place. Today many waterside resorts are attractive for traveling not only during the summer season, motivating a wider range of travellers to visit them. Based on the Hungarian experience, the article focuses on the role of the natural environment in tourism to waterside places. Following an overview of the pertinent literature, the results of an empirical study conducted among potential Hungarian travelers (urban people with waterside holiday experience) are presented. The research includes the role of the natural environment in the Image of a waterside holiday, in the decision-making process, and among the characteristics of Hungarian waterside destinations. According to the study results, the natural environment is represented most strongly by the water-shore situation itself and plays an outstanding part in the image of a waterside holiday, independent of any socio-demographic factors analysed. So the natural environment at the waterside itself is an attraction for potential travelers. An interesting outcome of the research was that the advantages of a domestic trip ranked prominently when rating the characteristics and uniqueness of Hungarian waterside destinations. Besides the water the flora and fauna, a nice panorama form important parts of the waterside natural enviroment on the mental map of potential travelers. The social-cultural aspect of a waterside destination deals only with the cotraveling family and friends, not with the host community. The 'place-specific' attractions are not dominant, and the general image of waterside destinations is strongly influenced by the Image of Lake Balaton. The closer the destination is, the smaller the geographical area is (e.g. lake, city) on the mental map of urban people with waterside holiday experience. The research highlights sports, culture, gastronomy and wines, as well as health tourism among the attractions independent of the water attraction itself. Among them, sports can be a motivation for a waterside trip. This means that although the relaxation is still dominant at the watersides, the Hungarian destinations are more and more attractive during the low season as well. So tourism demand is shaped by touristic developments, and inversely, the demand trends call for new types of attractions, services, etc. In conclusion, we point out that the awareness of the natural environment's role in waterside destinations can help to find the real values of those places. Mapping the watersides' characteristics in this study can be a success factor for a sustainable and competitive future in mature destinations, and can help develop new ones.

It also economically impacts the general public, industries like recreational and commercial fishing, and tourism. Analysis of a 140-year core record from Utikuma Lake, northern Alberta, revealed the processes behind the lake's current hypereutrophic conditions. End-member modeling analysis (EMMA) of the sediment grain size data identified catchment runoff linked to specific sedimentological processes. ITRAX X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elements/ratios were analyzed to assess changes in precipitation, weathering, and catchment runoff and to document changes in lake productivity over time. Five end members (EMs) were identified and linked to five distinct erosional and sedimentary processes, including moderate and severe precipitation events, warm and cool spring freshet, and anthropogenic catchment disturbances. Cluster analysis of EMMA and XRF data identified five distinct depositional periods from the late 19th century to the present, distinguished by characteristic rates of productivity, rainfall, weathering, and runoff linked to natural and anthropogenic drivers. The most significant transition in the record occurred in 1996, marked by an abrupt increase in both biological productivity and catchment runoff, leading to the hypereutrophic conditions that persist to the present. This limnological shift was primarily triggered by a sudden discharge from a decommissioned sewage treatment lagoon into the lake. Spectral and wavelet analysis confirmed the influence of the Arctic Oscillation, El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation on runoff processes in Utikuma Lake's catchment.

The region considered in the present research is located in Central Italy, NW of Rome, between the Bolsena Lake and the Tyrrhenian Sea. This area exhibits two different landscape typologies represented by the Albegna and Flora rivers catchments where more than 300 archaeological sits have been detected. The analysis has concerned only 112 sites corresponding to graveyards and settlements, whose respective geographical coordinates have allowed to gather peculiar environmental parameters. These ones have been obtained from different data sets: the six TM bands of a LANDSAT subscene; a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), with derived thematic maps; hydrological and hydrogeological features extracted from suitable scale maps. The hydrological data are represented by streams branches, drainage divides, main springs sites, lake and sea coast lines, piezometric contours (to asses water table depth), hydrogeological unit identifications (to provide lithological and permeability informations). The obtained parameters are: morphometric (i.e. elevation, slope, aspect, local relief and morphometric code from the DEM), spectral (i.e. the TM value of the Landsat data) and hydrological (minimum distance from water resources, water table depth). They have been processed by applying a hierarchical clustering technique separately to the morphometric and spectral parameters, achieving as result the partitioning of the sites into meaningful classes, characterized by different morphology, land cover and physical status.

This study evaluates the effect of educational actions (EAs) among schoolchildren on adherence to diagnosis and treatment, as well as on knowledge of the disease. Methods: In April/2013, a questionnaire was applied to 6th-to-8th-grade pupils of eight public schools to evaluate prior knowledge of disease and self-reported risk behavior. Baseline parasitological survey (PS) was done in May/2013, followed by selective treatment and cure assessment. The schools were then randomly allocated to experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups, with and without EAs, respectively. EAs were conducted for 3 months from August/2013. Questionnaire was reapplied in November/2013, April/2014, October/2014, and October/2015 to evaluate changes in knowledge about the disease and self-reported risk behavior. Two further annual PSs (May/2014 and May/2015), each followed by treatment of positives, allowed to evaluate between-group differences and infra-group changes in adherence to diagnosis and treatment, and to follow-up prevalence and intensity of infection. Results: Adherence to diagnosis did not differ significantly between EG (84.1%) and CG (81.1%) at baseline but was significantly higher in EG in subsequent PSs. Overall, adherence to treatment was higher than 90% in all three PSs; cure was 98.4%, egg-reduction was 99.8% and reinfection, 2.8%. Prevalence fell significantly in EC (from 23.5% to 6.8%) and CG (from 21.8% to 2.4%), the same occurring with intensity (from 54.2 to 4.6 epg in EG and from 38.4 to 1.3 epg in CG). Disease knowledge increased significantly in EC and CC; knowledge about disease transmission increased significantly more in the EG. Self-reported risk behavior remained above 67% and did not differ significantly between EG and CG. Conclusion: EAs increased adherence of schoolchildren and improved knowledge about the disease, confirming that EAs are an important tool to enhance schoolchildren participation in control campaigns.

J	PAYETTE, S				PAYETTE, S			LATE-HOLOCENE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBARCTIC OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS - ALLOGENIC AND AUTOGENIC SUCCESSION	ECOLOGY												Ombrotrophic peatlands that developed on islands in Clearwater Lake, a large subarctic lake in northern Quebec [Canada], provide evidence of long-term community stability and successional change. Repeated alternations of regeneration cycles of Sphagnum cushions and black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) over the last 5050 14C years of peatland development suggest climate, self-building mechanisms, and cyclic-autogenic succession as the dominant active factors operating in the absence of external disturbance such as fire. During the last several thousand years, self-perpetuating vegetation cycles have occurred at variable periodicity and have been controlled primarily by local ecological conditions whose existence is marked by differential peat accumulation rates. Water supply for peat production, in the absence of a water table in most sites, was controlled by snow availability, precipitation, and atmospheric humdity from the large lake. Allogenic succession, illustrated by the community shifts from Sphagnum girgensohnii-Piea to S. russowii-Picea, S. fuscum-Picea, and lichen-heath, has been initiated by climate, and more particularly by continuous peat accumulation enhancing, as time passed, the ecological gradient from moist, snow-protected conditions to snowless, exposed conditions. In contrast, absence of such changes at some sites characterized by a uniform, self-regenerated S. fuscum-Picea assemblage suggests that autogenic succession has been an active driving mechanism in community persistence over several thousand years. Large-term trends in peatland development toward topographic equilibrium and late-Holocene cooling best explain the gradual phasing-out of the vegetation cycles. Natural deforestation over the last 2000 14C years may have triggered a negative feedback process by changing the winter snow environment and the associated thermal soil regime. The ensuring peat fossilization, permafrost aggradation, and ice-wedge development at the peatland surface are all events consistent with the occurrence of this process. Present growth of the peatland proceeds mostly along the margoms, where levelling of the topographic profile is not yet completed.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1988	69	2					516	531		10.2307/1940450	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940450													WOS:A1988M749600023
J	Srivastava, P; Jovane, L				Srivastava, Priyeshu; Jovane, Luigi			Misinterpreting proxy data for paleoclimate signals: A comment on Shukla et al. 2020	HOLOCENE												Shukla et al. explored paleoclimatic signals from a similar to 8 m thick profile of a moraine-dammed lake in the central Himalaya exposed due to lake burst from a flash flood in 2013. The main objective of their research work is to understand the complex glacial-climate system during late-Holocene. They attempted a novel multi proxy approach for paleoclimate reconstruction but their work suffers from misinterpretation of various proxies and erroneous/misleading discussion. We therefore report following major points in this comment article. (1)Misinterpretation of magnetic parameters: Magnetic susceptibility (chi lf) has been used to interpret changes in magnetic mineralogy rather than concentration of magnetic minerals. Susceptibility of anhysteretic remanence (chi ARM) has been used at several places to indicate presence of superparamagnetic (SP) and multi domain (MD) ferrimagnetic particles rather than single domain (SD) ferrimagnetic (magnetite) particles. Interpreting erroneous negative values of percentage of frequency dependent susceptibility (chi fd%) for climate change. (2)Poor chronology: Overlaps in ages of glacial-lake sediments. (3)References: Several statements in paper have not been referenced and some of them have out of place citations. (4)Carefree writing: Authors have shown typical example of carefree writing of a research article, for example, giving units to dimensionless parameter S-ratio, and chi fd%, differences in units of chi lf in text and figure, different depths for the same age in text and figure. (5)Over interpretation: Authors at places have interpreted climatic variations based on only one sample. (6)Poor justifications: Authors did not provide any detailed justification for proxy data while interpreting climatic variations. (7) No data (results) on mineralogy and trace elements were given. Overall it is not only a problem of presentation and misinterpretation of proxy data but the study also fails to deliver the final message of climate change and glacier dynamics in the central Himalaya.					; Jovane, Luigi/AAH-5438-2020; Srivastava, Priyeshu/F-2002-2015	Jovane, Luigi/0000-0003-4348-4714; Srivastava, Priyeshu/0000-0001-7672-1929													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2020	30	12					1866	1873	0959683620941165	10.1177/0959683620941165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620941165		JUL 2020											WOS:000548901600001
J	Das, N; Mehrotra, S				Das, Nirupam; Mehrotra, Surabhi			Flood Risk Assessment through Spatial Planning Approach: Study of Bhoj Wetland Catchment within the Zone of Influence, India	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT												Urbanization has increased drastically in recent years, endangering the biodiversity of wetlands. Wetland health is directly influenced by the type of development in its catchment area and zone of influence (ZOI). To understand the type of development in the ZOI, research was carried out at the Bhoj wetland, India. The aim of the current study is (1) to identify the flood risk zones in Bhoj wetland catchment area and (2) to study the sporadic growth of settlements in the ZOI of the Bhoj wetland catchment. In the current study, flood-prone areas in the ZOI of the Bhoj wetland have been identified by using hydrological tools in ArcGIS. The CARTOSAT-1 and CARTOSAT-2E images were utilized to analyze the growth pattern of permanent settlements in the ZOI for the years 2011 to 2021 that fall under high flood-prone areas. The result shows that the number of permanent settlements has nearly doubled in the ZOI area in past 10 years and a major part of these settlements come under a very high flood risk zone. A land fragmentation analysis has been performed to identify the temporal changes in patch density within a 5 km buffer area of the Upper Lake. The outcomes show that the core area has decreased by 31.33%, while the patch and edge areas have increased by 51.99% and 5.89%, respectively. The outcome of this study will help policymakers to control the unplanned growth within the ZOI, which not only induces adverse changes in the wetland ecosystem but also endangers human lives and assets.

J	RODEN, EE; TUTTLE, JH				RODEN, EE; TUTTLE, JH			INORGANIC SULFUR TURNOVER IN OLIGOHALINE ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Inorganic sulfur turnover was examined in oligohaline (salinity < 2 g kg-1) Chesapeake Bay sediments during the summer. Cores incubated for < 3 hr exhibited higher sulfate reduction (SR) rates (13-58 mmol m-2 d-1) than those incubated for 3-8 hr (3-8 mmol m-2 d-1). SR rates (determined with (SO42-)-S-35) increased with depth over the top few cm to a maximum at 5 cm, just beneath the boundary between brown and black sediment. SR rates decreased below 5 cm, probably due to sulfate limitation (sulfate < 25 muM). Kinetic experiments yielded an apparent half-saturating sulfate concentration (K(s)) of 34 muM, almost-equal-to 20-fold lower than that determined for sediments from the mesohaline region of the estuary. Sulfate loss from water overlying intact cores, predicted on the basis of measured SR rates, was not observed over a 28-hr incubation period. Reduction of (SO42-)-S-35 during diffusion experiments with intact core segments from 0-4 and 5-9 cm horizons was less than predicted by non-steady state diagenetic models based on (SO42-)-S-35 reduction in whole core injection experiments. The results indicate that net sulfate flux into sediments was an order of magnitude lower than the gross sulfur turnover rate. Solid phase reduced inorganic sulfur concentrations were only 2-3 times less than those in sediments from the mesohaline region of the Bay, despite the fact that oligohaline bottom water sulfate concentrations were 10-fold lower. Our results demonstrate the potential for rapid SR in low salinity estuarine sediments, which are inhabited by sulfate-reducing bacteria with a high affinity for sulfate, and in which sulfide oxidation processes replenish the pore water sulfate pool on a time scale of hours.																			0168-2563						1993	22	2					81	105		10.1007/BF00002706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002706													WOS:A1993MJ47200001
J	HORN, H; HORN, W				HORN, H; HORN, W			SEDIMENTARY LOSSES IN THE RESERVOIR SAIDENBACH - FLUX AND SINKING VELOCITIES OF DOMINANT PHYTOPLANKTON SPECIES	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Sedimentation of phytoplankton was studied in the meso/eutrophic reservoir Saidenbach for two years and measured as biovolume in a sedimentation trap near the bottom. It comes to an annual average of 2.76 cm3/m2 x d (0.4 ... 10.9) and is statistically significant dependent on the free water concentration measured 14 days before. This allows flux to be reliably calculated without any direct measurement. The bottom is reached above all by diatoms which form 90 % of the deposited algae. The sinking velocity of the diatoms is mainly determined by their physiological state: During growth phases low sinking velocities (0.1 ... 2 m/d) were found, while in decline phases they increased considerably (> 6 m/d). The highest average sinking velocities found among large diatoms were calculated for Fragilaria crotonensis (3 ... 4 m/d), the lowest for Melosira italica (1.5 ... 2 m/d). The values for Asterionella formosa, Synedra acus and Diatoma elongatum were between them. Turbulence has no influence on sinking velocity (usually, spring full circulation sees the highest sedimentary losses), but plays an essential part in the survival of th e population in free water. Permanent redistribution prevents diatoms from sinking out from the euphotic layer, this ''inoculation'' making further development possible. On an annual average, phytoplankton forms approximately only one quarter of the whole trap sediment (max. 62 %). The flux of the dry weight of seston (2.33 g/m2 x d on an average) reflects the changes in phytoplankton flux negligibly only and does not reveal any relation to it, so that seston flux is not suitable for determining phytoplankton sedimentation. But it is possible to calculate this at a probability of 65 to 94 %, by using the free water concentration measured 14 days before.																			0020-9309						1993	78	1					39	57		10.1002/iroh.19930780106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780106													WOS:A1993LR15800003

As such, deforestation increases landslide activity over short, decadal timescales. However, over longer timescales (0.1-10 Myr) the location and timing of landsliding is controlled by the interaction between uplift and fluvial incision. Yet, the interaction between (human-induced) deforestation and landscape evolution has hitherto not been explicitly considered. We address this issue in the North Tanganyika-Kivu rift region (East African Rift). In recent decades, the regional population has grown exponentially, and the associated expansion of cultivated and urban land has resulted in widespread deforestation. In the past 11 Myr, active continental rifting and tectonic processes have forged two parallel mountainous rift shoulders that are continuously rejuvenated (i.e., actively incised) through knickpoint retreat, enforcing topographic steepening. In order to link deforestation and rejuvenation to landslide erosion, we compiled an inventory of nearly 8000 recent shallow landslides in (C) Google Earth imagery from 2000-2019. To accurately calculate landslide erosion rates, we developed a new methodology to remediate inventory biases linked to the spatial and temporal inconsistency of this satellite imagery. Moreover, to account for the impact of rock strength on both landslide occurrence and knickpoint retreat, we limit our analysis to rock types with threshold angles of 24-28 degrees. Rejuvenated landscapes were defined as the areas draining towards Lake Kivu or Lake Tanganyika and downstream of retreating knickpoints. We find that shallow landslide erosion rates in these rejuvenated landscapes are roughly 40 % higher than in the surrounding relict landscapes. In contrast, we find that slope exerts a stronger control on landslide erosion in relict landscapes. These two results are reconciled by the observation that landslide erosion generally increases with slope gradient and that the relief is on average steeper in rejuvenated landscapes. The weaker effect of slope steepness on landslide erosion rates in the rejuvenated landscapes could be the result of three factors: the absence of earthquake-induced landslide events in our landslide inventory, a thinner regolith mantle, and a drier climate. More frequent extreme rainfall events in the relict landscapes, and the presence of a thicker regolith, may explain a stronger landslide response to deforestation compared to rejuvenated landscapes. Overall, deforestation initiates a landslide peak that lasts approximately 15 years and increases landslide erosion by a factor 2 to 8. Eventually, landslide erosion in deforested land falls back to a level similar to that observed under forest conditions, most likely due to the depletion of the most unstable regolith. Landslides are not only more abundant in rejuvenated landscapes but are also smaller in size, which may again be a consequence of a thinner regolith mantle and/or seismic activity that fractures the bedrock and reduces the minimal critical area for slope failure. With this paper, we highlight the importance of considering the geomorphological context when studying the impact of recent land use changes on landslide activity.					; Govers, Gerard/A-8298-2008; DeWitte, Olivier/V-1148-2019; Campforts, Benjamin/F-8798-2015	Jacobs, Liesbet/0000-0002-1137-5372; Campforts, Benjamin/0000-0001-5699-6714; Dewitte, Olivier/0000-0002-4593-7505; Govers, Gerard/0000-0001-9884-4778; Depicker, Arthur/0000-0003-2963-9396; Uwihirwe, Judith/0000-0002-0351-5726; 													2196-6311	2196-632X				MAY 31	2021	9	3					445	462		10.5194/esurf-9-445-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esurf-9-445-2021													WOS:000658336600001

Cost and time required for analysis of these constituents by conventional chemical techniques can be limiting factors in these studies. Determination of these constituents by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) may be a rapid, cost-effective method provided the technology can be applied generally across aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using NIRS to predict total C, CO3-2 organic C, N, and P in deep-water sediment cores from four Canadian lakes varying over 19 degrees of latitude. Concentration ranges of constituents in the samples (dry weight basis) were total C, 12-55; CO3-2, 6-26; organic C, 7-31; N, 0.6-3.1; and P, 0.22-2.1 mg g(-1). Coefficients of determination, r(2), between results from conventional chemical analysis and NIR-predicted concentrations, based on calibrations across all the four lakes, were 0.97-0.99 for total C, organic C, and N. Prediction for CO3-2 was good for the hard water lake from a calibration across all four lakes, but this constituent in the three soft water lakes was better predicted by a calibration across the soft water lakes. The NIR calibration for P fell below acceptable levels for the technique, but proved useful in the identification of outliers from the chemical method that were later removed with the re-analysis of several samples. This study demonstrated that NIRS is useful for rapid, simultaneous, cost-effective analysis of total C, CO3-2, organic C, N, and P in dried sediments from lakes at widely varying latitudes. Also, this study showed that NIRS is an independent analytical tool useful for the identification of outliers that may be due to error during the analysis or to distinctive composition of the samples.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2000	24	4					415	425		10.1023/A:1008151421747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008151421747													WOS:000165089600004

However, a lack of interdisciplinary analyses, quantitative climate data together with inadequate characterization of the desert vegetation has hindered a comprehensive understanding of past vegetation and environmental changes in the region. Here we perform a high-resolution analysis of pollen, grain size, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from a 617-cm sediment core from Lop Nur to reconstruct vegetational and environmental changes between similar to 23.3 to 7.2 cal kyr BP and understand their potential drivers. Results show that variations in solar activity and westerlies drove water circulation in the region, triggering an alternateon between temperate shrubby desert and temperate semi-shrubby/dwarf semi-shrubby desert, accompanied by the fluctuations in lake level fed by alpine meltwater. Lake organic matter was mainly derived from aquatic vascular plants and phytoplankton in the latest Pleistocene (similar to 23.3-11.6 cal kyr BP), but shifted to a greater diversity of sources (soil, C-3 terrestrial plants, aquatic vascular plants and phytoplankton) in the early to middle Holocene (11.6-7.2 cal kyr BP), while the nitrogen levels in the lake sediment were mainly controlled by soil erosion, and only marginally influenced by atmospheric nitrogen deposition. These findings provide a past analog for the prediction of future environmental change and ecosystem sustainable development in ACA under the scenario of global change.

However, previous studies have predominantly focused on broad-scale climatic or land use changes, lacking a fine-scale spatiotemporal analysis of how oasis expansion specifically drives water-yield dynamics in such basins. To fill this critical gap, this study uses the Ebinur Lake Basin as a representative case, employing a locally calibrated InVEST model combined with Geodetector analysis to systematically quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of water yield and examine the influence of oasis expansion from 2000 to 2020. Water yield is a vital provisioning service underpinning ecological stability and sustainable resource management. Our results indicate that the oasis area expanded significantly (+2.04 x 103 km2 per decade), whereas water yield experienced a declining trend (-8.58 mm per decade). Notably, high water yield values remained concentrated in the adjacent mountainous regions, while the total water supply within oasis areas followed a "rise-then-fall" pattern, with 2010 marking a distinct turning point. Precipitation emerged as the primary determinant of water yield, and the combined influence of precipitation and temperature was found to be the most critical factor shaping its spatial distribution. The introduction of localized parameters into the InVEST model enhances the accuracy of water yield assessments in inland river basins. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both oasis expansion and climatic variability into water resource management strategies, offering valuable insights for the sustainable evaluation and management of oasis ecosystem services in similar arid regions.

Salliq Project Management Comm; Arviat Project Management Comm	Braiding Inuit knowledge and Western science to understand light goose population dynamics under a changing climate	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												. Increasing abundance of Snow and Ross's Geese (Anser caerulescens and Anser rossii; kangut and qaaraarjuk in Inuktut, respectively), referred to collectively as light geese, has caused alterations in various Canadian Arctic ecosystems. Inuit have harvested light geese for generations and hold knowledge that offers unique insights into the ecology and population dynamics of these species. By combining interviews with 40 light goose harvesters and Elders with results from aerial surveys in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut, we (1) describe changes in light goose distribution and abundance between the 1940s and the 2010s, (2) explore the effects of light geese on local ecosystems, and (3) identify factors driving these changes. Inuit observations gathered through lifetimes of land-based observations and results from aerial surveys concurred that (1) light goose numbers have increased regionally since the 1940s, and (2) light goose numbers decreased in several colonies within the Kivalliq region between the 1960s-1990s and the 2010s, including in two Migratory Bird Sanctuaries. Inuit have noted that habitat loss due to overgrazing and grubbing has pushed light geese to abandon altered habitats in favor of new breeding and foraging sites. Inuit observations also indicated that light geese have altered their migration behavior (how, when, and where they migrate and nest) in response to earlier spring snowmelt, the drying of ponds and lakes, and an increased number of predators. These conclusions add substantially to overall understanding about light geese in regions where aerial surveys are expensive and infrequent, and scientific studies are limited in geographic coverage.																			1708-3087					APR	2025	30	2							17	10.5751/ES-16079-300217	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-16079-300217													WOS:001482988800002

This study presents the results of the analysis on the living conditions offered to aquatic birds by the aquatic habitats of ROSPA0143 Upper Tisa protected area and highlights the importance of the aquatic habitats from Tepli ța for the conservation of biodiversity. Tepli ța aquatic system registers the largest number of aquatic species (66 out of a total of 68 for the entire protected area), of species that occur only here (22), of those nesting exclusively at Tepli ța (36.84% of the total nesting aquatic species) as well as the largest populations of aquatic species that are important for conservation. The vegetal carpet that supports the fauna has a simplified structure due to anthropic pressures, being comprised of three types of hygrophilous habitats, but with a high degree of ruderalization. Water quality analysis reveals a slightly more basic pH value for Tisa than for the 3 lakes in the area. Also, high values of dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation determined for Tisa and the three lakes reflect a good level of oxygenation, above the minimum of 6.5-8 mg & BULL;L-1 required for healthy water. In accordance to water legislation, all measured parameters (i.e., alkalinity, Na, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, Cl, iron) fall within the very good, good, and moderate quality classes.

The content and composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are representative indicators of the degree and character of an anthropogenic impact in nat-ural habitats. The aim of the work was to assess the level of PAH content in the bottom sediments, to identify potential sources and to assess the toxicity of bottom sediments. It was established that the average content of n-ary sumation PAH in the sediments amounted to 806 +/- 380 ng/g, with the values of this parameter ranging over 34-4036 ng/g. At five out of ten stations in Lake Donuzlav, PAH values, average for the Black Sea, were ex-ceeded. These stations were grouped along both banks in the inner part of the reservoir. Fourteen PAHs were identified: Nap, 2mNap, Flu, Phe, Ant, Fla, Py, TrPhe, Chr, BbF, BkF, BaP, DBA, BghiP. The main share falls on the binuclear Nap and 2mNap, which indicate the presence of fresh oil pollution. The average share of these compounds over the water area was 60 +/- 5%, and at stations with elevated levels of n-ary sumation PAH it was 74 +/- 4%. There was a close correlation between the content of all polyarenes, which coefficient averaged 0,88. The presence of geochemical relationships between polyarenes enter -ing from different sources was probably due to the functioning of natural mechanisms aimed at the transformation of pollutants, which served to restore the dynamic balance of the system.					; Soloveva, Olga/X-4793-2019; Barabashin, Timofey/IZD-8056-2023	Soloveva, Olga/0000-0002-1283-4593; 													2383-451X	2383-4501					2022	9	1					95	106		10.22059/poll.2022.342592.1468	http://dx.doi.org/10.22059/poll.2022.342592.1468													WOS:000885479700008

Quentin			Early-Holocene moraine chronology, Sognefjell area, southern Norway: evidence for multiple glacial and climatic fluctuations within the Erdalen Event (∼10.2-9.7 ka)	NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												In southern Norway, early-Holocene climatically induced glacier expansion episodes have been recognised at similar to 11.1, 10.5, 10.2, 9.7 and 8.2 ka, but the only convincingly dated, single- or double-ridged moraines are those associated with the regional Erdalen Event (i.e., similar to 10.2-9.7 ka). We applied three numerical-age dating techniques to sequences of up to five moraine ridges deposited by the former Sognefjellice capand by Styggedalsbreen, a large cirque glacier in the nearby Hurrungane massif. On inner and outer ridges and relict patterned ground proximal to the moraines, six Be-10 and eight Schmidt hammer (SHD) surface exposure ages were obtained. Thirteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from stream-bank mire sediments proximal to the Sognefjell moraines. The basal date is similar to those from cores in an adjacent lake indicating disappearance of the Sognefjell ice-cap immediately following the Erdalen Event. Three of four SHD results, and one of three 10Be surface exposure ages from the Sognefjell moraines support this. At Styggedalsbreen, two of three 10Be surface exposure ages lie between the 8.2 ka (Finse) and Erdalen Event, though 1 sigma dating uncertainties only overlap with the former: the third is clearly affected by cosmogenic nuclide inheritance. SHD results also suggest the younger event, but this is attributed to lithological differences between the Schmidt-hammer calibration site and the sampled moraine boulders. Considering the chronological evidence as a whole, supported by equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) calculations for Styggedalsbreen, we conclude that the moraines were formed by up to five short but distinct fluctuations of these ice masses during the Erdalen Event. This indicates more complex decadal- to centennial-scale glacier variations and climatic perturbations within the Erdalen Event than previously recognised. The implied exceptional glaciological sensitivity to climate variability is attributed to local topographic factors causing glacial fluctuations in response to relatively small ELA changes.

Dust transport and synoptic conditions over the Sahara-Arabia deserts during the MIS6/5 and 2/1 transitions from grain-size, chemical and isotopic properties of Red Sea cores	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Red Sea, situated between the Sahara and Arabia deserts, is a natural trap for fine-grained particles transported by winds and floods from weathered materials in these deserts, derived from the Proterozoic crustal granitic and basaltic terrains and Phanerozoic carbonates. The accumulated fine particles provide valuable information on the climate conditions in the source regions, and modes of atmospheric circulation over the Red Sea region. Here, we report on the grain-size, mineralogy, chemical composition, and Nd and Sr isotope ratios of fine-grained insoluble residues (IR) from acid leaching, that were recovered from two deep-sea cores KL23 and KL11 drilled in the northern and central Red Sea, respectively. We focus on the MIS6/5 and MIS2/1 transitions. KL23 samples are closer to the "Sahara granitoids" field and display significant variations during the MIS6/5 transition, between epsilon Nd of -7 to -2 and Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.7096 to 0.7114. Smaller variations occurred during the MIS2/1 transition, between epsilon Nd of 5 to 6 and Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.7104 to 0.7118. The KL11 values are closer to the "Blue Nile" field, which comprises mixtures of granitoid and basalt derived particles. During the MIS6/5 transition their epsilon Nd varies from -4 to -1 and in Sr-87/Sr-86 from 0.7059 to 0.7091. During periods equivalent to sapropels S5 and S1, both cores appear to converge to similar isotope ratios of epsilon Nd similar to -2 and Sr-87/Sr-86 similar to 0.7095, indicating derivation from the granitoid terrains of the Arabian-Nubian Shield occurring adjacent to the Red Sea and possibly distributed by runoff. In terms of synoptic conditions, the data indicate that during glacials, dust was blown to the northern Red Sea from the northern Sahara desert in association with the Mediterranean winter cyclones, and to the central Red Sea from the Ethiopian plateau by southern winds that are associated with monsoonal circulation. During interglacials, especially sapropel intervals, monsoonal rains caused erosion and flooding at the Arabian-Nubian Shield margins of the Red Sea. During the Heinrich events associated with the studied intervals (H11 and H1), dust from mixed basaltic-granitic terrains was blown from all of the regional sources in the Red Sea region, reflecting severe regional aridity and transport of dust by regional winds, when monsoonal activity and Mediterranean cyclone activity were weak.

J	Floater, GJ				Floater, GJ			A risk model for predicting the effects of lake-side development on wildfowl populations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The lack of quantitative analysis and general scientific rigour in environmental impact assessment (EIA) is well documented. While reasons for this may include political and economic factors, the lack of high-level statistical knowledge and skills in environmental consultancies probably contributes to the problem, particularly with regard to ecological studies. This paper develops a simple model for wintering wildfowl populations that predicts different levels of risk from lake-side development. The aim was to create a model that could be used easily and quickly by consultants, is readily understandable for developers and various groups associated with the planning process, with explicit assumptions that can be criticised, and predictions that can be tested with post-development audits. The model is used in a case study. The basic parameters of the model are (i) average wildfowl abundance on lakes before development, (ii) maximum potential density of wildfowl across lakes (K-max) before development, and (iii) reduction in lake area suitable for wildfowl after development. The model includes abundance-area relationships that are useful for highlighting the importance of particular lakes at a site. In the case study, abundance-area relationships focused attention on two lakes with thick charophyte beds which supported higher than expected numbers of pochard and coot given their size. As well as being robust (confidence limits are calculated), the model's predictions are quantitative and testable, making it possible to compare the predictions with on-going post-development monitoring of wildfowl population levels. The predictions rely on the effectiveness of path screening, and post-development monitoring can suggest where screening should be strengthened if the model's predictions are not met. Similarly, if other assumptions in the model are not met by the development, appropriate action can be implemented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Landslide susceptibility and controlling factors: An assessment in the Fagnano Lake Basin"	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Slope stability is controlled by multiple factors, including bedrock properties, topography, lithology, structural features, climate, and seismicity. However, their specific role in landslide dynamics remains poorly understood in many under-studied regions. This study presents the first comprehensive landslide inventory for the Fagnano Lake Basin, aiming to analyze the influence of these factors on mass movement processes. Using a GIS-based approach, we integrate seismicity, proximity to tectonic structures, lithology, and topography to assess their contribution to slope failures. Our susceptibility map correlates well with the spatial distribution of the 473 identified landslides, which include slides, flows, slope deformations, and falls, with flows being the most common. While shallow landslides occur frequently, deep-seated landslides cover larger areas and involve greater material displacement. Large-scale flows and slides dominate, whereas slope deformations have a more limited geomorphic impact. Seismic activity linked to the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault System (MFFS) plays a significant role in triggering shallow landslides, particularly in the Hope Mounts and western Fagnano Lake Basin. Our findings suggest that landslide occurrence results from complex interactions between tectonic, topographic, and seismic factors, particularly in the Sierras de Beauvoir and Hope Mounts. However, further investigation is needed to assess seismic influences on other MFFS structures with limited recent documentation. This research provides essential insights into landslide susceptibility in a region lacking prior comprehensive studies, emphasizing its importance for hazard assessment and mitigation efforts.

J	Kara, Y; Özdemir, ET				Kara, Yigitalp; Ozdemir, Emrah Tuncay			Investigating the performance of PBL parametrizations in WRF model for front enhanced SES simulation in istanbul megacity	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Sea-effect snow (SES) is a meteorological phenomenon resulting from cold air moving over warmer waters. Accurate prediction of SES is vital for emergency management, transportation, and water resource planning. A thundersnow event in Istanbul from 17-19 February 2015 caused significant disruptions, with traffic and flights affected, highways temporarily closed, and trees falling due to heavy snowfall. This study investigates the influence of different parameterization schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model on SES simulations. Six distinct PBL parameterization schemes were used in a series of WRF simulations. In addition, the following factors pivotal to SES event have also been investigated: 1000-500 hPa thickness, total and latent heat fluxes, radar and satellite analyses, temperature gradients, wind shear, inversion levels, and atmospheric stability indices. Additionally, the formation of SES during the cold front transition further contributed to these elements in the Black Sea region. The simulations displayed notably high total heat flux and latent heat flux values, particularly following the passage of the cold front. Furthermore, the northeast-southwest oriented SES cloud, distinguished by its banded structure, was successfully validated using radar and satellite imagery. However, it's worth noting that the model positioned it farther west than its actual location. This study highlights the challenges in precise prediction and analysis of such convective activities. In this thundersnow event, the local closure schemes, particularly MYNN in first place and second MYJ, demonstrated superior performance compared to non-local schemes within the parameterization options.

SPATIAL ANALYSIS FROM REMOTELY SENSED OBSERVATIONS OF CONGO BASIN OF EAST AFRICAN HIGH LAND TO DRAIN WATER USING GRAVITY FOR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF LOW LAYING CHAD BASIN OF CENTRAL AFRICA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION I SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission I Symposium	NOV 17-20, 2014	Denver, CO	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing Tech Commiss, ASPRS Pecora Fall Meeting				The Chad basin which covers an area of about 2.4 million kilometer square is one of the largest drainage basins in Africa in the centre of Lake Chad. This basin was formed as a result of rifting and drifting episode, as such it has no outlet to the oceans or seas. It contains large area of desert from the north to the west. The basin covers in part seven countries such as Chad, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroun, Niger, Sudan and Algeria. it is named Chad basin because 43.9% falls in Chad republic. Since its formation, the basin continues to experienced water shortage due to the activities of Dams combination, increase in irrigations and general reduction in rainfall. Chad basin needs an external water source for it to be function at sustainable level, hence needs for exploitation of higher east African river basin called Congo basin; which covers an area of 3.7 million square km lies in an astride the equator in west-central Africa-world second largest river basin after Amazon. The Congo River almost pans around republic of Congo, the democratic republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, western Zambia, northern Angola, part of Cameroun, and Tanzania. The remotely sensed imagery analysis and observation revealed that Congo basin is on the elevation of 275 to 460 meters and the Chad basin is on elevation of 240 meters. This implies that water can be drained from Congo basin via headrace down to the Chad basin for the water sustainability																			2194-9034						2014	40-1						279	286		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-1-279-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-1-279-2014													WOS:000368435600042

Isolation of estrogen receptor subtypes and vitellogenin genes: Expression in female Chalcalburnus tarichi	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Reproductively arrested gonadal development has been previously described in the teleost 'pearl mullet (Chalcalburnus tarichi, Cyprinidae) from Van Edremit Gulf of Lake Van, Turkey. Oocyte development in some females was arrested at the previtellogenic stage, while gonadosomatic index (GSI) and plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) level were low. A subset of the females was found to have normal ovaries and relatively higher plasma Ey and GSI. These two groups were termed reproductively arrested (RA) and reproductively non-arrested (RN) females. In this study, we cloned estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms (ER alpha, ER beta 1 and ER beta 2) and vitellogenin (Vtg), and their mRNA levels were measured in RA and RN fish tissues. C tarichi ERs fell in the same clade with other fish ERs and ERa and ER beta 1 had 97% and 98% identity with the roach (Rutilus rutilus) ERs, respectively. Both Vtg and ER isoforms' mRNA abundance were higher in the liver than in the ovary and hypothalamus (liver > ovary > hypothalamus). The level of ERa mRNA was significantly lower in the liver, ovary and brain of RA fish than in the RN fish tissues. ER beta 1 mRNA levels were not different in the liver and ovary from RA and RN fish while ER)32 expression significantly increased in the liver and ovary from RA fish. All ER subtype expression was found to be lower in the brain from RA fish than RN fish. The level of Vtg mRNA was significantly lower in the liver and ovary from RA fish than RN fish tissue. These results suggest that ER subtypes are differentially regulated by Ey, and their functions are also different in vitellogenesis. Analysis of organic contaminants in sediments revealed that C tarichi living in Van Edremit Gulf of Lake Van are exposed to the contaminants bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and 4,4' DDT. We suggest that the RA fish represent a segment of the population that is more sensitive to exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds.

J	Powell, EN; Kim, Y; Bushek, D				Powell, Eric N.; Kim, Yungkul; Bushek, David			TEMPORAL STRUCTURE AND TRENDS OF PARASITES AND PATHOLOGIES IN US OYSTERS AND MUSSELS: 16 YEARS OF MUSSEL WATCH	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Parasites and pathologies of oysters and mussels were sampled yearly from 1995 to 2010 from the Gulf of Maine to Alaska and the Great Lakes as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Status and Trends Mussel Watch Program. Sentinel bivalves included mytilid mussels, dreissenid mussels, and oysters. This comprehensive dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine long-term temporal dynamics of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices of these sentinel bivalves. Temporal dynamics fell into a few clear categories. Significant differences between years occurred commonly for parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices; the absence of significant change over time was more noteworthy. In a few cases, these trends were characterized by multiyear increases or decreases in value within the time series. Such behavior might be produced by a multiyear cycle and, in fact, such behavior was much more common along the southern East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and Southern California where a relatively short cycle, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is well documented. More interestingly, for a number of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices, significant trends existed across the time series. These trends substantively exceed the time span of climate cycles influencing these regions such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation. A few of these longer term coherent trends were continental in scale, being observed across sentinel taxa and multiple coasts. Continental scale trends were restricted to the physiological indices such as length. Regional trends were important for a subset of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices. In general, the regional trends were produced by single-celled proliferating parasites such as Perkinsus marinus, the major pathologies, and certain physiological indices. The multicellular eukaryotes and the gregarines often showed significant year-to-year changes without trend. Temporal trends were prominently represented by oyster parasites on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and by mytilid parasites on the West Coast. Pathologies by contrast had strong temporal signals in northeastern mytilids.																			0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	2015	34	3					967	993		10.2983/035.034.0325	http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.034.0325													WOS:000367745300025

Lake sediments started to accumulate at similar to 14,700 cal yr BP. Initially the upland vegetation consisted of an open forest with mainly Betula and Salix and few Pinus sp., but from 14,500 cal yr BP onwards, Pinus mugo, P. sylvestris and Populus and later on also Larix became established around the lake. Between 14,150 and 13,950 cal yr BP, Pinus cembra seems to have replaced P. mugo and P. sylvestris. At similar to 13,950 cal yr BP the tree cover increased and Picea appeared for the first time, together with Pinus cembra, P. mugo and Larix. From similar to 13,750 cal yr BP onwards, a Picea forest developed around the site. Based on the combined proxy data the following climatic development may be inferred: 14,700 14,500 cal yr BP, cooler and wet/humid; 14,500-14,400 cal yr BP: gradually warmer temperatures, wet/humid with dry summers 14,400-14,320 cal yr BP: warm and dry; 14,320 14,150 cal yr BP: cooler and wet/humid; 14,150 14,100 cal yr BP: warm and dry; 14,100-13,850 cal yr BP: warmer and wet/humid; < 13,850 cal yr BP: warm and dry. The tentative correlation of this development with the North Atlantic region assumes that the period > 14,700 cal yr could correspond to GS-2a, the time span between 14,700 and 14,320 to GI-1e, the phase between 14,320 and 14,150 cal yr BP to GI-1d and the time frame between 14,150 and 13,600 cal yr BP to the lower part of GI-1c.

J	Wansard, G; De Deckker, P; Julia, R				Wansard, G; De Deckker, P; Julia, R			Variability in ostracod partition coefficients D(Sr) and D(Mg) implications for lacustrine palaeoenvironmental reconstructions	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Living and sub-recent ostracods were collected from four lakes and foul springs, located in Belgium, France and Spain, characterized by low water Mg/Ca ratios (from 0.08 to 0.65). Valves of ostracods belonging to Cyprideis torosa, Candona neglecta, C. marchica and C. candida have been extensively analysed for their magnesium and strontium contents with respect to calcium. Comparisons of these results are made using the same elements from the waters in which the ostracod valves calcified. Our results offer new and somewhat different interpretations with respect to the uptake of Mg and Sr in the calcitic ostracod valves. These findings include the following. (1) The partition coefficient L)(Sr for ostracods belonging to the same genus (Candona) is not a constant. The observed variability in D(Sr) values could be due to the rare of biological calcification, although more investigations are necessary to assess the influence of this factor; it is possible that some taxa grouped under the genus Candona belong to a different genus. (2) Even at the species level (Cyprideis torosa), the ostracod D(Sr) cannot be considered to be constant. At low water Mg/Ca ratio (0.65), our D(Sr) value for C. torosa is higher than those determined by others for C. torosa calcified in evolved marine water. (3) The Mg/Ca ratio of the water appears as a major factor influencing D(Mg) for ostracods. For low water Mg/Ca values (< similar to 2), D(Mg) drastically increases. This phenomenon is also effective for inorganic calcite; implying a non-biologic effect that could be linked to Mg2+ adsorption. Consequently, large variations in ME content of fossil ostracod valves from selected lacustrine sequences, with expected low water Mg/Ca(< similar to 2), can be due to small variations in water Mg/Ca.

This investigation focused on the effect of Moina mongolica on restricting M. aeruginosa blooms under different variables (temperature, light intensity, and salinity) and its growth at the molecular level. The results of batch experiments showed that the range of M. mongolica feeding rates was from 4.02 +/- 0.81 x 10(3) similar to 182.23 +/- 5.37 x 10(3) cells/ind center dot h in the whole experiment, where the highest feeding rates of larva M. mongolica and adult M. mongolica were 133.21 +/- 5.24 x 10(3) vs. 182.23 +/- 5.37 x 10(3) cells/ind center dot h at 30 degrees C, 85.88 +/- 0.44 x 10(3) vs. 143.15 +/- 14.07 x 10(3) cells/ind center dot h at 3000 lx and 88.18 +/- 0.32 x 10(3) vs. 84.49 +/- 4.95 x 10(3) cells/ind center dot h at 0 parts per thousand salinity, respectively. The results of transcriptomics further demonstrated that the response of M. mongolica to M. aeruginosa toxicity was caused by the downregulation of relevant functional genes (cell components, cell processes, metabolic processes, and protein complexes) and related signaling pathways (apoptosis, phagosome, lysosome, ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, amino and nucleoside sugar metabolism, and PPAR signaling pathways). The findings show that M. mongolica can be released to low-salinity lakes and coastal areas (the subtropic and temperate zones) to prevent and inhibit M. aeruginosa blooms in the early summer phase. Additionally, the results achieved by the investigation will provide the relevant technology for inhibiting cyanobacteria blooms because M. mongolica even resists the produced toxin by M. aeruginosa.

J	Worthington, EB				Worthington, E. B.			THE LIFE OF LAKE ALBERT AND LAKE KIOGA	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												A 5 mo. fishing survey of these lakes was made in 1928. The depth of L. Albert, not previously known in detail, is nowhere more than 47 m., this rift lake haying been apparently silted up by the large rivers, Semliki and Victoria Nile. A series of cuspate sand bars and forelands, due to wind and wave currents afford the only sheltered waters; they control the distribution of the shore fishes, and so of the native fishing population. L. Kioga is nearly all less than 3 m. deep, large areas being covered by papyrus or water-lilies. It is a dying remnant of a great lake which, during the 2nd pluvial period, connected with L. Victoria and covered tracts of land to the north and south. The Murchison Falls, between the lakes, divides the Victoria-Kioga fauna above from the Albert and lower Nile fauna below. The fishing survey collection adds largely to the fauna of each lake and emphasizes this distinction, only 5 fishes being common to both faunas. Four new sp. (2 Lates) are recorded from Albert, and 6 new sp. (3 Barbus) from Kioga. Native fishing methods are described, the most unique being that of certain Banyoro natives of L. Albert, who take advantage of a natural food chain (Haplochromis albertianus[long dash]Hydrocyon forskalyi[long dash]Lates albertianus) in hand-line fishing. The last species grows to 200 lbs. weight and long-line fishing for it, as already practiced in a primitive way by Jonam natives, should prove of economic value. European influence has as yet had little effect on the fishing. Factors controlling the distribution of population are, in order of importance:[long dash]Tsetse fly; presence of fish (dependent on shore formation); salt deposits; presence of game.																			0016-7398	1475-4959				AUG	1929	74	2					109	132		10.2307/1785309	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1785309													WOS:000203665700001

The district operates a 5.8-mile-long 36-inch pipeline that is part of an aqueduct transporting raw water from the regional water wholesaler, San Diego County Water Authority's raw water system, to downstream treatment facilities. The 36-inch concrete-lined cylinder pipe line was inspected in early 2017, and the inspection flagged a number of localized areas with distress. Since most of the distress appeared to be externally induced, there were no internal visual indicators available to help facilitate subsequent repairs. As such, the repair efforts required a multi-stage approach where initial verifications efforts drove future verification and repair decisions. Initially, pipe tally listings and heat-color map representations of the pipes were used to locate areas of distress. While this allowed verification and rehab efforts for distressed areas nearby manholes, areas further away required a different approach. This paper discusses the challenges involved with location and verification of the distressed areas, the unique techniques implemented to resolve the challenges, and the drivers for selecting the optimal rehabilitation type. Factors that were considered were accessibility of the above ground terrain, nearness of infrastructure such as overhead busy roads, and the severity of the identified distress. The paper concludes with a cost comparison and overview of lessons learned which the authors believe will benefit other aqueduct operators.																					978-0-7844-8165-3				2018							743	752																WOS:000542616400083

Human settlements are rare and domestic and wild animals are concentrated in the alpine meadows. A set of modern surface samples and fossil pollen from a deep-water core was evaluated with focus on indicator types revealing human impact, grazing activities and lake system development during the last ca. 12 cal ka BP. The non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) record, comprising remains of limnic algae and invertebrates as well as fungal spores and charred plant tissue fragments, were examined in order to attest palaeolimnic phases and human impact, respectively. Changes in the early and middle Holocene limnic environment are mainly influenced by regional climatic conditions and glacier-fed meltwater flow in the catchment area. The NPP record indicates low lake productivity with high influx of freshwater between ca. 11.5 and 4.5 cal ka BP which is in agreement with the regional monsoon dynamics and published climate reconstructions. Geomorphologic observations suggest that during this period of enhanced precipitation the lake had a regular outflow and contributed large amounts of water to the Sutlej River, the lower reaches of which were integral part of the Indus Civilisation area. The inferred minimum freshwater input and maximum lake productivity between ca. 4.5-1.8 cal ka BP coincides with the reconstruction of greatest aridity and glaciation in the Korzong Valley, resulting in significantly reduced or even ceased outflow. We suggest that lowered lake levels and river discharge at a larger regional scale may have caused irrigation problems and harvest losses in the Indus Valley and lowlands occupied by sedentary agricultural communities. This scenario, in turn, supports the hypothesis that Mature Harappan urbanism(ca. 4.5-3.9 cal ka BP) emerged in order to facilitate storage, protection, administration, and redistribution of crop yields, and secondly, the eventual decline of the Harappan Culture (ca. 3.5-3 cal ka BP) was promoted by prolonged aridity. There is no clear evidence for human impact around Tso Moriri prior to ca. 3.7 cal ka BP, with a more distinct record since ca. 2.7 cal ka BP. This suggests that the sedimentary record from Tso Moriri primarily archives the regional climate history. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In recent years the civil developments have expanded the city boundaries so that this wetland is now located within the city whereas it was previously considered as a suburban area of Ardebil. This development has affected its natural status. In this research data were collected through sampling and direct observation. In order to measure the physicochemical parameters seven stations were defined and the amount of BOD(11), COD(2), F.cf(3), T.cf(4), Ta(5), Tw(6), pH, DO(7), Ec(8) and TDS(9) were determined. In old days the water of this wetland was supplied by rainfall and springs located within the lake and valleys around it. The water of the wetland was salty (Ec=95043 Microsiemens per cm), TDS=8250 mg/l. The water was of chloride type, which made it useless for irrigation. However, today, the water of the lake is supplied by Almas dam (built on Ballekhlo River) the water of which is led into the wetland through a canal. In 2003 the salty water of the wetland was completely emptied and was refilled. This changed it to a supply of fresh water. The physicochemical parameters were measured (Ec=460 microsiemens per cm, TDS=1097 mg/l and Sal.=0.2 gr/Li) which indicated basic changes in the ecosystem of the wetland. Moreover, other kinds of pollution including the leakage of waste water of agricultural drainage, the presence of engine boats, disposal of solid waste, the civil development and the execution of comprehensive tourist plan are threatening life in this lake. Some basic strategies have been offered based on the findings of this research.

J	Pan, Y; Gong, J; Li, JY				Pan, Yue; Gong, Jian; Li, Jingye			Assessment of Remote Sensing Ecological Quality by Introducing Water and Air Quality Indicators: A Case Study of Wuhan, China	LAND												In the context of ecological protection and urban expansion, the quality of the ecological environment and ecological security are gravely at risk. A simple, effective, and comprehensive assessment method for regional environmental quality monitoring is urgently required at this time. This study proposes a comprehensive approach for evaluating regional ecological quality. Based on Landsat TM+OLI/TIRS images, indicators representing the ecological quality of land and water were constructed. Land ecological quality consists of land surface moisture (WET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized building bare soil index (NDBSI), and land surface temperature (LST), which represent humidity, greenness, dryness, and temperature, respectively. At the same time, the remote sensing indices of chlorophyll_a (chl_a) and suspended solids (SS) were constructed to characterize the water quality. Air quality was characterized based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) in MCD19A2. By introducing water and air quality indicators and utilizing principal component analysis, a remote sensing ecological index that improves water area assessment (WIRSEI) was established and applied to Wuhan from 2000 to 2020. The driving force of WIRSEI change was analyzed using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results revealed that (1) air quality AOD and humidity WET greatly impacted the ecological quality (WIRSEI). WIRSEIs in seven central urban areas were significantly lower than that in six remote urban regions, and the ecological quality of lakes was higher than that of rivers. (2) From 2000 to 2020, Wuhan's overall WIRSEI showed a "rising-falling-rising-stable" trend. In most regions, the degree of ecological quality change was relatively small; most grades were "no change", "slightly better", and "slightly worse", representing 88-93% of the total area. (3) The change in WIRSEI from 2000 to 2020 was closely related to urban expansion, population change, and economic development. The effects of land use and socioeconomic changes on WIRSEI were significantly different in spatial distribution. Compared to the driving factors, land use dynamics (LUCD) significantly impacted WIRSEI changes, while the effects of gross domestic product (GDP) and population (POP) were very small. This study uses WIRSEI to evaluate the regional ecological quality, providing a vital reference and basis for enhancing regional ecological quality assessment methods, promoting ecological environmental protection and restoration, regional coordination, and sustainable development. The research results show that the proposed approach is simple and effective, strongly supporting regional ecological quality and protection monitoring.					li, jingye/HJY-6670-2023	Li, Jingye/0000-0001-6561-2962														2073-445X				DEC	2022	11	12							2272	10.3390/land11122272	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11122272													WOS:000901085100001
J	WEST, RG				WEST, RG			INTERGLACIAL DEPOSITS AT BOBBITSHOLE, IPSWICH	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The stratigraphy and paleobotany of freshwater interglacial deposits at Bobbitshole, Ipswich, Suffolk, were investigated. The interglacial deposits occupy a lake basin in a valley cut in the local plateau, which is partly formed by a chalky boulder clay assigned to the Gipping advance. In this basin was deposited a series of lacustrine sediments, first silt (probably of aeolian origin), then claymud and finally clay. These interglacial sediments are sealed uncon-formably by sandy gravel, probably deposited under cold conditions. Pollen diagrams and macroscopic plant remains from the interglacial deposits are described. They give evidence of the vegetational and climatic history during the first half of an interglacial period. The succession of pollen zones found is similar to that described from- the Eemian (Last) Interglacial in north-west Europe, with which the interglacial is correlated. An analysis of the abundant macroscopic plant remains, together with the pollen results, suggests a rapid amelioration of the climate at the beginning of the interglacial period, and in zone f, the final zone represented, there are indications of a summer warmth exceeding that of the present day in the area. The interglacial flora is particularly rich in aquatic plants, and an analysis of the abundance of each species indicates a vegetational succession, as the lake filled with sediment, from open-water to reed-swamp to marsh vegetation. The palaeobotany of the deposits is briefly compared with that of other inter-glacial deposits in Britain and on the continent. The correlation of the interglacial deposits with the continental Eemian (Last) Interglacial provides confirmation of the correlation of the Gipping ice advance with the Saale Glaciation of northern Germany, and indicates that the covering gravels are of Last Glaciation age.																			0962-8436	1471-2970					1957	241	676					1	31		10.1098/rstb.1957.0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1957.0006													WOS:A1957WX66400001

Restoring land-water - water transition areas to stimulate food web development is mediated by the hydrological connectivity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Land-water transition areas play an important role in the functioning of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Enhancing habitat complexity and heterogeneity by restoring or adding land-water transition areas to degraded aquatic ecosystems can be effective management to stimulate productivity by lower trophic levels - and hence increase food availability for biota of conservation interest, including fish and birds. Here, we studied whether hydrological connectivity can be used as an environmental indicator (connected or disconnected) for the development trajectories of newly constructed land-water transition areas in shallow lakes. We capitalized on a large-scale restoration project called "Marker Wadden", which created new land-water transition areas with and without hydrological connectivity in a degraded shallow lake in the Netherlands (Lake Markermeer). We compared how the new areas with and without hydrological connectivity developed with respect to abiotic parameters and biomasses of benthic, pelagic, and emergent macroinvertebrates. In sites disconnected from the open water, water depths became significantly lower than in hydrologically connected sites during summer, likely due to evaporation. In these shallower waters, daytime temperatures and organic matter content of the sediment were higher, while dissolved oxygen concentrations remained sufficient. Therefore, biomasses of benthic macroinvertebrates and emergent insects became higher in the disconnected sites. These lower trophic levels could provide higher food availability for benthivorous and insectivorous birds, while remaining inaccessible to fish. This puts forward that hydrological connectivity (connected or disconnected) can be used as an environmental indicator for aquatic food web development trajectories, and that it regulates relative food availability for fish and birds. Restoring land-water transition areas without hydrological connectivity provides higher biomasses of lower trophic levels, which are only accessible to birds. Restoring areas with hydrological connectivity results in relatively lower biomasses of invertebrates, but these provide food to birds feeding on invertebrates, and fish and fish-eating birds. Creating areas including both types of land-water transition zones, connected and disconnected to open water can benefit fish and birds of both feeding guilds.					; Bakker, Elisabeth/B-7185-2008; Van Leeuwen, Casper/B-9166-2012	Jin, Hui/0000-0002-6325-031X; Bakker, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5900-9136; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2024	167								112615	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112615		SEP 2024											WOS:001318330400001

Occupational Health Risks and Hazards Among the Fisherfolk in Kampi Samaki, Lake Baringo, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												Globally, almost 2.78 million deaths that occur annually are attributed to work-related health risks. Worldwide and, especially, in developing countries, about 20% to 50% of the workers are exposed to health risks. Fishing is an ancient occupation, and like many others, it is characterized by numerous health risks and hazards. This study sought to understand the exposure of fisherfolk to human health risks, through fish handling and processing in Lake Baringo, Kenya. The study adopted a cross-sectional social survey design. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select respondents for this study. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the respondents to collect data on risks involved during the handling and processing of fish. Key informant interviews and observation checklists were also used to collect more information. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Inferential statistics included Pearson chi(2) test, which was used to test the association of various factors on the encounter with occupational health risks. The level of significance was tested at alpha = 0.05. The study findings reveal the fisherfolk-encountered risks such as cuts, eye irritability, sunburns, skin burn, cold, falls, and musculoskeletal injuries during their work. The results showed that only 12% of the fisherfolk use personal protective equipments (PPEs) at work. Pearson chi(2) test analysis showed there was an association between gender and gender roles (chi(2) = 39.517, P < .05). In addition, an association was revealed between occupational health risks and gender (chi(2) = 16.283, P < .05). There was also an association between occupational hazards and gender (chi(2) = 21.352, P < .05). However, there was no association revealed between occupational health risk and marital status (chi(2) = 1.305, P > .05) and PPEs (chi(2) = 1.089, P > .05). Furthermore, results indicate that 61% of the fisherfolk who suffered from occupational health risks missed work. The study concludes that all the fisherfolk at Kampi Samaki are exposed to various health risks while working, which is thus likely to affect their health. We recommend public health campaigns to sensitize fisherfolk on the associated risks in fish handling and processing. There is also a need for health campaigns for the fisherfolk to appreciate the need for First Aid Kits during the fishing operations.

Quantitative reconstruction of the Holocene vegetation and climate dynamics in the semiarid Mongolian Altai suggests that boreal woodland replaced the primarily open landscape of northwestern Mongolia at about 10 kyr BP (1 kyr = 1000 cal yr) in response to a noticeable increase in precipitation from 200-250 mm/yr to 450-550 mm/yr. A decline of the forest vegetation and a return to a predominance of open vegetation types occurred after 5 kyr BP when precipitation sums decreased to 250-300 mm/yr. Prior to 11.5 kyr BP diatom concentrations are relatively low and the lake is dominated by planktonic Cyclotella and small Fragilariaceae, suggesting the existence of a relatively deep and oligotrophic/mesotrophic lake. The great abundance of Staurosirella pinnata from the beginning of the record until 10.7 kyr BP might imply intensified erosion processes in the catchment and this is fully consistent with the presence of scarce and dry vegetation and the generally and climate during this period. From about 10.7 kyr BP, more planktonic diatom taxa appeared and increased in abundance, indicating that the lake became more productive as diatom concentration increased. This change correlates well with the development of boreal woodland in the catchment. Decrease in precipitation and changes in the vegetation towards steppe are reflected by the rapid increase in Aulacoseira distans from about 5 kyr BR The Holocene pollen and diatom records do not indicate soil and vegetation cover disturbances by the anthropogenic activities, implying that the main transformations of the regional vegetation occur-red as a result of the natural climate change. Our reconstruction is in agreement with the paleomonsoon records from China, demonstrating an abrupt strengthening of the summer monsoon at 12 kyr BP and an associated increase in precipitation and in lake levels between 11 and 8 kyr BP, followed by the stepwise attenuation of the monsoon circulation and climate aridization towards the modern level. The records from the neighboring areas of Kazakhstan and Russia, situated west and north of Hoton-Nur, demonstrate spatially and temporally different Holocene vegetation and climate histories, indicating that the Altai Mountains as a climate boundary are of pivotal importance for the Holocene environmental and, possibly, habitation history of Central Asia.

Stable Isotope Systematics of Mg, Sr, and Li in Hydrothermal Fluids and Hypersaline Lake Brines in the East African Continental Rift (Djibouti)	GEOFLUIDS												The Asal Rift is a continental rift segment in which the hydrothermal reactions of hot volcanic rocks and seawater-derived groundwater are comparable to the submarine hydrothermal processes. Formation of recent evaporites in the hypersaline Lake Asal and Lake Abh & eacute; is superimposed on this seafloor-type hydrothermal activity. From a geological and planetary science perspective, these continental rift lakes are valuable natural calibration fields for constraining the water-rock interaction and elemental cycles. In this study, we report on the chemical composition and stable isotopic fractionation of Mg, Sr, and Li in the hydrothermal fluids and brines of these two hypersaline lakes. The hydrothermal fluids of both Lake Asal and Lake Abh & eacute; were characterized by lower Mg isotopic ratios than seawater. This is explained by the removal of 26Mg from the fluids during the hydrothermal fluid-basalt interaction. In contrast, the brine from Lake Asal is indistinguishable from seawater, and no apparent effect of evaporite minerals on delta 26Mg was observed. The 87Sr/86Sr and delta 88Sr values of the hydrothermal fluid vary within the same range as the basalt, indicating that the effect of Sr leaching from the rock is significant. In contrast, the variation in delta 88Sr is mainly caused by the precipitation of carbonates from the lake brine. The correlation between delta 7Li and 87Sr/86Sr is clear regardless of the sample type (hydrothermal fluid, brine, or river water) and is thought to reflect the mixing of solutes. The delta 7Li values of the hydrothermal end-members can be used as an indicator of the reservoir temperature of fluids.

The Omo Delta, on the Ethiopia-Kenya border, is constantly changing due to fluctuating lake levels, a variable climate, and rapidly changing land use. Due to field data scarcity and the region's limited accessibility, we relied on remote sensing (RS) data to investigate delta extent between 1990 and 2018 and attempted to disentangle the effect of climatic from anthropogenic variables. We obtained a time series of delta extent from Landsat imagery using Random Forest (RF) classification. Using parametric and non-parametric regression techniques, we regressed the delta extent on Lake Turkana levels, Omo River discharges, Omo-Gibe Basin rainfall, tree cover loss, and irrigation extent. The RF algorithm distinguished water from land with high (>90%) accuracies and revealed Omo Delta extent fluctuations ranging from 949 km2 in 1993 to 651 km2 in 2000. Lake water level, which depends on the rainfall over the Omo-Turkana Basin, emerged as the best predictor of delta extent. However, the annual rainfall over the Omo-Gibe Basin showed no correlation with delta extent. The regression models further show a connection between delta extent, irrigation extent, and tree cover loss. We conclude that rainfall indirectly influences delta extent across the Omo-Turkana Basin. Regression models indicate additional cumulative effects of human activity in the Omo-Gibe Basin but fall short in explaining delta dynamics.					; Kleinschroth, Fritz/AAM-5636-2020; Dondeyne, Stefaan/AAM-5524-2021; Kangi, Gladys/KFT-2728-2024	Van Orshoven, Jos/0000-0001-5756-7188; Dondeyne, Stefaan/0000-0002-7422-7860; Kleinschroth, Fritz/0000-0002-7614-2123; Kangi, Gladys/0000-0002-1819-1752													1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 30	2024	35	2					867	883		10.1002/ldr.4958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4958		OCT 2023											WOS:001090616700001

Limnological changes in South Carpathian glacier-formed lakes (Retezat Mountains, Romania) during the Late Glacial and the Holocene: A synthesis	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Remains of aquatic biota preserved in mountain lake sediments provide an excellent tool to study lake ecosystem responses to past climate change. In the PROLONG project a multi-proxy study was performed on sediments of glacier-formed lakes from the Retezat Mountains, Southern Carpathians (Romania). The studied lakes (Lake Brazi and Gales) are situated on the northern slope of the mountain at different altitudes (1740 m and 1990 m a.s.l.). Our main objectives were 1) to describe the main limnological changes in these lakes during the last ca. 15,000 years and 2) to summarize the environmental history of the studied lakes based on taxonomical and functional patterns of the biological proxies. For this synthesis we used the results of diatom and chironomid analyses, and indirect biotic and abiotic parameters, including sediment organic matter (LOI) content, geochemical element concentrations (Al, Ca, S, Sr) and biogenic silica content. Using multivariate numerical approaches we analysed changes in the assemblage structure of siliceous algae and chironomids, compared temporal patterns among proxies, examined the relationship between potential driving factors, chironomid and diatom assemblage changes and identified paleolimnological phases of the lake successions. Changes in assemblage composition and aquatic ecosystem state apparently followed summer insolation, local climatic conditions and local productivity changes driven by these. Diatom and chironomid assemblages generally changed in a similar direction and at a similar time within a lake, but differed to some extent between Lake Brazi and Gales. At both lakes the strongest variations were observed in the Late Glacial and the first half of the Holocene. The strongest Holocene assemblage changes took place in the earliest Holocene in Lake Brazi, but extended into the mid-Holocene in Lake Gales, following long-term insolation changes and climatic changes. In addition, three common zone boundaries were identified: at ca. 14,200 and at ca. 6500 cal yr BP for every records and at ca. 3100 cal yr BP for diatom records in both of the lakes and for the chironomid record of Lake Brazi. This multi-proxy synthesis provides comprehensive data that increase our understanding of the past variability of lake ecosystem functioning and biodiversity in East-Central Europe.

J	LaBounty, JF; Burns, NM				LaBounty, James F.; Burns, Noel M.			Long-term increases in oxygen depletion in the bottom waters of Boulder Basin, Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Long-term changes in the hypolinmetic volumetric oxygen demand (HVOD) of Boulder Basin, Lake Mead were determined from dissolved oxygen profiles collected from 1991 to 2007. HVOD is the rate at which oxygen in a deep layer in contact with the sediments is depleted during the period of thermal and/or chemical stratification. Generally, the rate at which oxygen is depleted is correlated to the amount of organic debris in the hypolimnion and sediments. The sediment oxygen demand reflects historical organic loading, while HVOD is a measure of productivity because of the organic particles settling from above. The lower hypolimnion in Boulder Basin remains relatively stable during the stratification period, enabling the calculation of HVOD in the near-bottom water layer. Small increases and/or decreases that occur in temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations are detectable. Boulder Basin fully destratifies every other year on average, but mixes only partially in the spring (before May) of the remaining years. The HVOD rates after partial and complete destratification have been assessed separately for 1995-2005. The annual HVOD rate is generally lower the year after partial destratification than after complete destratification due to greater downward transport of oxygen into the hypolimnion. The HVOD of Boulder Basin is variable depending on loading of nutrients and water into the Basin. The rate dropped significantly following commencement of advanced wastewater treatment practices in 1994. The rates then increased 1996-2006 at a rate of approximately 0.75 mg DO/m(3)/day per year, or about 7% annually. During those years the inputs of nutrients steadily increased. Rates have been dropping from 2005 to present (2007) following further reduction of phosphorus input. A multiple regression analysis revealed that HVOD is significantly positive related to the total phosphorus concentration in Las Vegas Bay, but significantly negative to inflows of Colorado River water. That means HVOD was highest when reservoir water was nutrient-rich and flow rates were low. HVOD should be considered a major toot for monitoring trophic state changes in Boulder Basin.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2007	23	1					69	82		10.1080/07438140709353911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140709353911													WOS:000245783000007
J	Basham, D; Zech, W; Donald, W; Whitman, J				Basham, Dakota; Zech, Wesley; Donald, Wesley; Whitman, Jarrell			Evaluating Sediment Removal Efficiency of Catch Basin Inserts as a Post-Construction Water Quality Tool on Roadways	WATER												Urban areas produce large amounts of stormwater runoff due to vast areas of impervious surfaces. Stormwater inlets, or catch basins, are commonly used for collecting and directing stormwater runoff away from streets and sidewalks. The conveyances used to direct flow to surface waters may be part of a municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). Typically, MS4s redirect runoff without providing a means for removing harmful pollutants. These pollutants are then often discharged directly into local lakes, rivers, and streams, potentially harming native aquatic ecosystems. Post-construction stormwater practices are commonly used to treat runoff from urban areas by reducing the total runoff volume, lowering peak flow rates, and/or removing harmful pollutants from runoff. However, some post construction stormwater practices require large footprints, construction, and maintenance. Catch basin inserts (CBIs) are one type of post-construction best management practice that are installed within existing catch basins and require no additional land use while still providing a means for removing pollutants from stormwater runoff before entering the MS4. However, limited data is available to demonstrate the expected performance of various CBIs to ensure that these practices meet the pollutant removal standards set forth by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the sediment removal capabilities of eight different proprietary CBI products for potential use as a post-construction stormwater practice for Department of Transportation projects. Results indicate that only two basket-type CBIs met the 80% sediment retention benchmark established for the study. While not surpassing the benchmark, three bag-type CBIs did achieve more than 70% sediment retention. The remaining three CBIs (one basket-type, one bag-type, and one cartridge type) fell notably short of the performance benchmark.					; Whitman, J./R-5798-2019	Whitman, Jarrell/0000-0002-0310-1961; Zech, Wesley/0000-0002-8176-5122														2073-4441				APR	2024	16	8							1081	10.3390/w16081081	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16081081													WOS:001210186800001

Disaster Risk Reduction Around a Heritage Temple Complex in Garhwal Himalaya	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR A HABITABLE EARTH, VOL 5, IAEG XIV CONGRESS 2023	Environmental Science and Engineering	Environmental Engineering			14th Congress of the International-Association-for-Engineering-Geology-and-the-Environment (IAEG)	SEP 21-27, 2023	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Assoc Engn Geol & Environm				Heritage structures are threatened by a multitude of disasters in high-relief, seismically active Himalayan environments. The major risks to the heritage structures are debris flows, landslides, rock falls, cloudbursts, snow avalanches, accelerated erosion, earthquakes, etc. Kedarnath temple, one of the most revered temples of Hindus, located in Garhwal Himalaya, at an elevation of 3562 m, was affected by Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), intense rainfall, and landslides in June 2013.The debris of moraines material moved due to the breach of the upslope glacial lake, not only damaging part of the temple complex but also inundating the temple complex and severely damaging the peripheral buildings of the township. The disaster inflicted colossal loss of life on the hundreds of pilgrims and damaged the township's infrastructure and road network. The deluge was so intense that it changed the course of River Mandakini, the bank on which the temple site is located. The area is part of the Central Crystalline Group of rocks consisting of granites, gneiss, and migmatites and lies close to the North Almora Thrust, and the Main Central Thrust. The terrain exhibits glacial landforms and glacial drift deposits. This study attempts to integrate geological, geomorphologic, and geophysical concepts for identifying the risks and vulnerabilities of the disasters for evolving a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plan around the heritage complex and proposes an alternate site for the townships and other urban features on a glacial terrace in downstream; host of structural measures to channelize the debris flows, drainage movements, protection of river banks, etc. by traditional resilience practices.

Picea/Abies forests are widely distributed at high altitudes of East and Central Asia, and their distribution changes are sensitive to climate change. Humidity is an important climatic factor that affects high-altitude ecosystems; however, the relationship between distribution changes of Picea/Abies forests and millennial-scale variability of humidity is still not clear. Palynological records can provide insights into millennial-scale paleovegetation changes, which have been successfully used to reconstruct past climate change in East and Central Asia. In this study, we synthesized 24 Picea/Abies pollen and humidity/moisture changes based upon Holocene lake records in East and Central Asia in order to explore the response of high-latitude ecosystem to millennial-scale climate change. The changing pattern of Holocene lacustrine Picea/Abies pollen in arid Central Asia differs from that of monsoonal East Asia, which can be due to different millennial-scale climate change patterns between monsoonal and arid Central Asia. Then, the relationship between changes in Picea/Abies pollen and humidity/moisture conditions was examined based on a comparison of pollen and humidity/moisture records. The results indicate that millennial-scale Picea/Abies distribution changes are mainly controlled by moisture variability at high altitudes, while the temperature effect plays a minor role in Picea/Abies distribution changes. Moreover, this research proves that lacustrine Picea/Abies pollen can be used as an indicator of millennial-scale humidity/moisture evolution at high altitudes in East and Central Asia.

J	Stankevicius, J; Pietroniro, A; Zhou, Q; Connon, R				Stankevicius, Jonas; Pietroniro, Alain; Zhou, Qi; Connon, Ryan			A climatological approach to predicting water level of Great Slave Lake	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The subarctic northern Canada, including Great Slave Lake (GSL) in the Northwest Territories, is undergoing unprecedented warming - up to four times faster than the global average over the past 40 years. This warming has significant hydrological impacts, altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and water balance of lakes and rivers. GSL, a crucial component of the Mackenzie River basin which has been gauged since 1934, has experienced extreme water level fluctuations in recent years, peaking with record high levels in September 2020 and having record lows in December 2023. These fluctuations directly impact water levels on the Mackenzie River, which has resulted in extreme flooding during high water levels and threatens navigability during low water levels, which is crucial for resupply of goods and services to isolated communities. In response, the Government of Northwest Territories (GNWT), Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and the University of Calgary have developed a hydraulic model to predict water levels and inform transportation planning. The GSL model uses historical hydrometric data and climatological information to estimate the residual net total supply (NTS) to the lake and incorporates stage-discharge relationships and level pool routing. Water level predictions are made up to 214 days ahead, potentially aiding in transportation planning downstream on the Mackenzie River. Model concept was validated through the historical period and testing was carried out using water level observations for 2022 and 2023. Testing showed that extreme events remain challenging to predict, especially when they fall outside of the bounds of historical observations. Ongoing model refinement aims to improve accuracy to provide more reliable information to decision makers and emergency management organizations.

J	Palombo, MR; Panarello, A				Palombo, Maria Rita; Panarello, Adolfo			What Was the "Devil's" Body Size? Reflections on the Body Mass and Stature of the Foresta Hominin Trackmakers (Roccamonfina Volcano, Italy)	QUATERNARY												The challenging task of correctly estimating the body size of prehistoric hominins from footprint dimensions has been a matter of long debate, but researchers are still divided about the best methodological approach for obtaining compelling estimates. This research attempts to infer the body size of the trackmakers, who impressed their footprints on the uneven ground slope of a Roccamonfina volcano's ignimbrite (approximate to 350 ka) at the Foresta/"Devil's Trails" ichnosite. We used the equations selected among the most adequate for the footprints of this peculiar ichnosite with an exploratory purpose and from a critical estimation point of view. The values of the body size derived from the different equations are highly variable; the minimum and maximum values can differ by up to 50%. The variation range is similarly large when applying the same equations to the footprints from some North African and European Lower Paleolithic ichnosites. The variability of the results mainly depends on the technique of footprint measurements, the environmental context (substrate, surface slope, trackmaker gait, etc.), the equation used, and, to a minor extent, the dimensional slight differences between a fleshy foot and a footprint. This makes comparisons among the sites challenging. All things considered, we could say that the average body mass (about 60 kg) and stature (about 166 cm) of Foresta trackmakers, who may be individuals of different sexes, fall in the range of the Middle Pleistocene Homo heidelbergensis s.l.																			2571-550X					JAN 21	2025	8	1							5	10.3390/quat8010005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat8010005													WOS:001452225500001

The EEMs-PARAFAC (three-dimensional fluorescence-parallel factor) method was used to analyse the grass surrounding Anfeng Pond. The extracts of stems, rice straws, and fallen leaves were used to extract DOM in the agricultural waste for analysis. The results showed that three components were separated from the grass stems, rice straws, and leaves, which were C1-type tryptophan, C2 visible-light region (fulvic acid-like), and C3-like humic acid (humic acid-like) components. Among them, the DOM of the leaf leachate mainly contributed the C2 visible light region (fulvic acid-like) components to the water body, and the DOM of the leaching solution of the grass stems and rice straw mainly contributed the C1-like tryptophan and C3-like humic acid components to the water body. Through principal component analysis, the DOM components of the grass stem and rice straw extracts showed similar characteristics; C1 and FI showed a significant (p<0.05) positive correlation, while C2 and C3 showed a very significant (p<0.01) positive correlation with FI and HIX index, respectively. The three components were significantly positively correlated with NO3-N. C3 was significantly positively correlated with NH4+-N. The management measures of agricultural wastes should be strengthened to reduce the transport of DOM produced by agricultural wastes to the water environment way.					; Zhang, Haiqiang/H-8186-2018	Mu, Ming/0000-0002-8821-4956; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2023	32	3					2261	2268		10.15244/pjoes/158889	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/158889													WOS:000972727900025

This improvement has come about in large part because of success in controlling point source pollution through an effluent limitation-based regulatory regime. Overall, our success in cleaning up pollution from point sources has not been matched by efforts to curb nonpoint source pollution. Under state control, nonpoint source pollution has been addressed through voluntary approaches such as planning, public education, technical assistance, incentive and cost share mechanisms, and best management practices. Despite substantial progress in areas such as manure management and soil erosion, the most recent National Water Quality Inventory indicates that many water bodies continue to fall short of water quality standards. Against this backdrop, the Texas Institute for Applied Environmental Research (TIAER) has focused on identifying policies to reduce the environmental impact of nonpoint source pollution associated with agriculture, while maintaining the economic viability of the industry. TIAER and Iowa State University Extension (ISUE) have collaborated to convene three national workshops in Washington, D.C., known as "Industry-Led Solutions." Funded through a cooperative agreement between TIAER and the EPA Office of Policy, the workshops bring together leaders from agriculture, government, and environmental organizations to identify issues and solutions for agricultural nonpoint source pollution. In short, Induitry-Led Solutions has been about empowering agricultural leaders to become more proactive in addressing challenges associated with nonpoint source pollution. TIAER believes this strategic approach offers producers an alternative that avoids direct regulation of agricultural lands, while providing a high probability of achieving water quality standards.																					1-892769-35-2				2003							51	56																WOS:000224563400009

Mercury in the Mackenzie River delta and estuary: Concentrations and fluxes during open-water conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Estimates of mercury (Hg) loadings to the Arctic Ocean from circumpolar rivers have not considered biogeochemical changes that occur when river water is temporarily stored in large deltas (delta effect). There are also few data describing Hg changes across the freshwater-saltwater transition zone (FSTZ) of these rivers. We assessed temporal changes in unfiltered total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations during open-water 2004 in the Mackenzie River upstream of the Mackenzie River delta, and in 6 floodplain lakes across an elevation gradient. These data were used to calculate Hg fluxes from the Mackenzie River and to evaluate a delta effect on Hg using an estimate of delta river water storage and a mixing analysis. Mean THg concentrations were highest in river water (9.17 +/- 5.51 ng/L) and decreased up the lake elevation gradient. Mean MeHg concentrations were highest in lakes periodically connected to the river (0.213 +/- 0.122 ng/L) and MeHg concentrations in elevated lakes showed a mid-summer peak. Results from the mixing analysis showed that the delta effect may be large enough to affect Hg loadings to the Arctic Ocean. THg concentrations exiting the delta (10.2 ng/L) were 16% lower than those entering (12.1 ng/L), whereas MeHg showed little change. We calculated 2.5-month (open-water) THg and MeHg fluxes from the Mackenzie River of 1208 and 8.4 kg. These fluxes are similar in magnitude to previous annual estimates in the arctic literature suggesting that previously published annual Hg fluxes from the Mackenzie River may be large underestimates. We also assessed changes in Mackenzie River water THg and MeHg concentrations as it crossed the FSTZ during an open-water cruise. THg decreased non-conservatively across the estuary from 3.8-0.6 ng/L, possibly due to mixing and particle settling. MeHg concentrations were variable and near detection. Our results show that the Mackenzie River estuary is a dynamic environment and may have important controls on Hg delivered to the Arctic Ocean. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since fall 1990, one lake half and the corresponding catchment has been sprinkled with artificial acid precipitation, while the other was left untouched. The catchment acidification experiment took place in an area of Norway receiving little acid rain. During a few day period in October 1994, after four years of acidification, the natural organic matter (NOM) from 22701 of water was isolated from each of the two sides of the lake, using the following sequential technique: coarse filtration: exchange of cations with Na+; concentrate organic solutes from 22701 of water to 701 by means of reverse osmosis membranes; filtration of the 701 through 0.45 mu m membranes; concentration to 4-51 by evaporation at low pressure and at 30 degrees C; freeze drying (yield 70-75 g). Small portions of both isolates (100-200 mg) were distributed to a number of different laboratories in Europe and North America for analyses. Characteristic data, such as distribution of ions, proton- and copper binding capacity, content of metals, content of organic S, organic N, free- and hydrolysable amino acids are reported here. A number of analytical techniques were used, including UV-VIS, IR and fluorescence spectrophotometry, C-13 NMR; pyrolysis, GC/MS and HPLC. Studies on adsorption- and flocculation abilities of the two "water qualities" and formation of trihalomethanes (THM) upon chlorination, is also included. The results from 10 different laboratories are presented and similarities and differences between the two semi-identical samples are discussed. Some studies of the consequence of the isolation step on the quality of the NOM, are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cold region hydrologic changes to a wet climatic regime in the Northern Great Plain	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The nature of a novel wet period beginning in the early 1990s controlled the hydrology of the northern portions of the North American Great Plains over last three decades. Such wetting with intermittent mild dry conditions influenced snow processes, streamflow generation, evapotranspiration, watershed storage and contributing areas although the hydrology of this wet period is extensively studied, aspects of the hydrology, particularly the nature of the streamflow - contributing area hysteresis relationship is little known. The temperature fluctuated during the 1990-2004 period such that there were three climate states: wetting-cooling (1990-96, CS1), wettingwarming (1997-1999, CS2) and drying-cooling (2000-2004, CS3). Here, we deploy a physically-based hydrologic model (the Cold Region Hydrologic Model, CRHM) to discern the predominant hydrological processes during each state in the Mauvais Coulee Basin (MCB) in North Dakota. Results indicate each state is characterized by distinct combinations of the lateral flux/precipitation (Q/P) and vertical flux/precipitation (V/P) ratios. The Q/P was insensitive during CS1 while it was very sensitive during CS2. In contrast, V/P was highly sensitive during CS1 and fluctuated minimally during CS2. The influence of V/P on watershed water balance was greatest during CS3. Water storage (antecedent fall soil moisture and snow water equivalent) and ET of the antecedent year control the contributing area and watershed storage states that influence the magnitude of Q generation. These dynamics are reflected in the distinct hysteresis between storage and streamflow in each of the three climate states.

In case of overflow, this can pose significant risks to downstream water quality and resources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive investigations on the chemical composition and water balance of lakes in QTP. This study examines the evolutionary mechanisms of alpine lakes in the Yanhu Lake Basin (YHB) located in central QTP. It investigates stable isotopes (518O and delta D), hydrochemistry, and utilizes the isotope balance model to determine the evaporation to inflow (E/I) ratio of lake water. The findings reveal that lake water exhibits a Cl-Na hydrochemical type with enrichment in total dissolved solids (TDS), boron (B), and lithium (Li) elements. On the delta D- 518O plot, lake water falls below the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) towards rightward direction with a slope of 4.75 and an intercept of 11.83, indicating pronounced evaporation characteristics. The presence of more positive isotope signals and ratios among major ions suggests that evaporation processes primarily govern lake water's hydrochemistry. The modeled E/I ratio ranges from 0.19 to 0.65 across YHB, implying a positive lake water balance which contributes to consistent expansion in surface area. This highlights the need for local government to enhance monitoring efforts, closely observe fluctuations in Yanhu Lake's water level, expedite implementation of lake water diversion projects, and conduct comprehensive assessment on their potential impact on local ecological environment.

The ID physician and ID pharmacist are located at the University of Minnesota Medical Center.Methods: Antimicrobial stewardship interventions were tracked monthly. Restricted antimicrobial days of therapy per 1000 patient days (DOT/1000 PD) were also tracked monthly and two years pre and postimplementation data were compared. All annual antimicrobial expenditures were followed.Results: For the first two TASP years, a total of 789 antimicrobial interventions were made with 85.6% being accepted. Restricted antimicrobial use trended down from 142.93 to 113.97 DOT/1000 PD at MHF Northland. A smaller decrease from 106.31 to 103.12 DOT/1000 PD was seen at MHF Lakes. Annual antimicrobial costs per total patient days decreased. MHF Northland hospital's annual antimicrobial expenditures per total patient days fell from $18.89 in 2019 (preimplementation) to $6.64. MHF Lakes followed a similar trend, decreasing from $11.20 to $5.36.Conclusions: A fully remote TASP in partnership with an academic medical center for two small community hospitals resulted in high rates of accepted interventions sustained over two years. Restricted antimicrobial use and antimicrobial costs trended down.

Full-scale experiments, physical and simulation modeling of the hydrodynamics of the catamaran hull, consisting of two motor boats of the "Wyatboat- 430"	MARINE INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES												This article examined options for using a catamaran, which is intended for coastal fishing, as well as fishing in inland waters. The catamaran itself structurally consists of two motor boats "Wyatboat- 430", connected by a fishing deck. The choice fell on a catamaran, as it has higher stability compared to a conventional vessel. The catamaran can more effectively tow active commercial fishing gear in coastal areas and inland waters. In order to determine the hydrodynamics of the catamaran hull, three experimental studies were performed. The first experiment was carried out with a full-scale catamaran on the lake. Vishtynetskoe and consisted of testing its running and towing characteristics. During the experiment, the maximum speed of the catamaran was developed, a sea anchor and a mid-water trawl were towed, and the towing speed was determined. The second experiment was carried out in the experimental pool of KSTU with a physical model of the same catamaran, made on a scale of Cl=0.15. The third experiment was numerical and was carried out on a life-size three-dimensional digital model of the catamaran created by the authors based on drawings and photographs. The digital model was created in a specialized program for creating three-dimensional objects "Blender" and was loaded into the computer program "Vessel Hydrodynamics" developed by the authors in order to calculate the hydrodynamic fields of velocities and pressures. The scientific significance of the conducted research lies in the substantiation of the methodology for verifying the results obtained experimentally on a full-scale catamaran and its physical model with the results of a numerical experiment.																			2073-7173						2024		3	1							10.37220/MIT.2024.65.3.055	http://dx.doi.org/10.37220/MIT.2024.65.3.055													WOS:001312862000038

One of them, non-emergent, occurred in dry lake Asale next to Black Mountain and south of Mount Dallol during fall 2004. We report on the opening of a 4.5 km-long fissure in the ground at the same time the Black Mountain dyke was intruding the crust 2 km westward and parallel to it. The fissure, located north and south of Yellow Lake (Gaet'ale) and trending NNW-SSE, is still hydrothermally active. First, we describe the remarkable diversity of morphologic expressions of the fissure, made possible by development in an evaporite sequence. Satellite image monitoring reveals that its formation is coeval with the latest intrusion stage of the Black Mountain dyke. Hydrothermal activity in the fissure area is, however older than similar to 60 years. It is suggested that hydrothermal activity is primarily a side effect of the igneous processes, probably sill intrusion, that resulted in the uplift of Mount Dallol area, in a similar to 400 m thick, fluid-saturated evaporite pile. We suggest that, in 2004, emplacement of the Black Mountain dyke caused dilation within the evaporite pile overlying it, where extension was also facilitated by pressured pore fluids. This study documents the delicate intermingling of magmatic, tectonic, hydrothermal, and geomorphologic processes in evaporitic environments at the transition between continental rifting and oceanic spreading.

J	Karig, DE				Karig, Daniel E.			A reassessment of the Erie Interstade from field work in the Cayuga basin, central New York	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Erie Interstade is generally accepted to have been a relatively warm period associated with retreat of the Laurentian ice sheet into the Lake Ontario basin, followed by a readvance to the Valley Heads (Port Bruce Stade) ice front in central New York. Recent investigations in the Cayuga basin indicate that this ice front retreated only to the Ithaca area during the Erie Interstade. In the Cayuga trough, Erie glaciolacustrine strata underlie Valley Heads deposits. Plant assemblages in these strata indicate a sub-Arctic environment. Erie deposits also occur in the Fall Creek Valley, where a varved sequence below Valley Heads till and above Nissouri till indicate deposition close to a retreating ice front. Remanent magnetic declination in the varves is 357 degrees, best correlated with lower Newport beds of the Middleville fm in the Mohawk Valley and suggests an age of 17.7 +/- 0.1 ka cal for the peak of the Erie retreat. Retreat only to the Ithaca area is based on the lack of Erie deposits north of Ithaca, an oscillation of the ice front around the south end of Cayuga Lake, and the lack of a fluvial interval in the Cayuga trough that would havemarked retreat into the Ontario basin. Ice core data from Greenland and sea level studies demonstrate that the Erie Interstade was neither a warm period nor a time of significant sea level rise. The Erie Interstade retreat/Valley Heads readvance appears instead to represent a minor reversal in the general, slow ice front retreat from the Last Glacial Maximum to the warm up at Melt Water Pulse 1.

ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY V: SPECIAL CONTRIBUTIONS					5th International Conference on Energy and Sustainability	DEC 16-18, 2014	Putrajaya, MALAYSIA	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia Res & Educ Network Green Tech WG, Wessex Inst Technol Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning				The ecological landscape is among the factors that may implicate tourists' visitations to a nature-based landscape of the highland environment. It is found that the natural beauty of certain natural resources makes a significant contribution to the development of nature-based tourism. Sustainable landscape management could be essential to continuously maintaining the rich biodiversity of an ecosystem. This study assesses the correlation of the scenic beauty of Fraser's Hill to its ecological landscapes. The natural heritage of Fraser's hill can be identified through its unique ecosystems (e.g. forest, waterfall and lake) that house varieties of flora and fauna. This study adopted the perception-based paradigm, in which the public were the respondents. The necessary data was collected using: 1) a photographic questionnaire survey (non-locals public); 2) a questionnaire survey (in situ tourists). Previous to this, an exploratory field observation (EFO) was carried out on site to determine the potential ecological attributes of the area. The results of the questionnaire survey show that the ecological attributes (e.g. hilly landform, greenery and water elements) have implicated the scenic beauty of Fraser's Hill. Similarly, the results obtained from the second method agree that the ecosystems (e.g. lake and water fall) with ecological attributes are most preferred. Findings show that there is a high agreement on the scenic beauty of the natural and historical heritage. The insights provide quantitative information that may implicate the sustainability of a highland environment, highland best management practices, local authorities, the economic value, the tourism industry and many more. Most importantly, the findings suggest that scenic beauty can be an indicator of a healthy ecosystem that may further sustain other sensitive environments of Malaysia.																					978-1-78466-096-3; 978-1-78466-095-6				2015							161	171		10.2495/ESS140141	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/ESS140141													WOS:000380764300014
J	Valentine, GA				Valentine, Greg A.			Effects of debris entrainment and recycling on explosive volcanic eruption jets and columns	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												A multiphase fluid dynamic model is used to explore the effects of entrainment of granular debris into sustained volcanic jets such as those which produce sub-Plinian to Plinian eruption columns. The debris may be sourced from processes such as avalanches from crater walls or from recycling of previously erupted material. The results indicate that debris is not immediately, homogeneously mixed into a jet but instead forms a dense sheath that is dragged upward around the jet margin. While very small volumes of debris relative to the eruptive discharge rate mix progressively into the jet with increasing altitude, the dense sheath can inhibit entrainment of air into the lower portions of the jet, which may explain signs of column instability such as increased stratification in fallout deposits where lithic content increases. As debris volume increases, the dense sheath can collapse from a range of elevations to feed pyroclastic currents. The presence of the sheath of entrained debris contradicts some assumptions such as the top-hat profile for density and velocity that is commonly used in 1-D models. Transitions from fallout-producing buoyant column to collapsing behavior can be related to debris entrainment without any changes in primary eruption parameters such as vent size, exit velocity, or gas content. Boiling-over behavior can also be caused by debris entrainment, including recycling of previously erupted material such as might occur in a crater with restricted outlet. When entrained debris is relatively fine-grained such that it can couple well with the erupting mixture, complex, highly transient overpressured jet processes can occur due to the pinching effect of debris flowing into the base of the jet. Increasingly coarse debris causes collimation of the jet within the sheath of entrained material. The results suggest that accounting for the effects of debris entrainment is likely important for theoretical assessment of many natural eruption sequences and for assessment of hazard scenarios for potential sub-Plinian to Plinian activity.																			0258-8900	1432-0819				SEP 12	2023	85	10							57	10.1007/s00445-023-01675-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-023-01675-8													WOS:001068627800002

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study presents the first comprehensive late Quaternary chronology of lake level variations of the Khyargas Nuur (western Mongolia), based on a geomorphological approach supported by luminescence dating of relict shorelines and lacustrine sediments. The endorheic Khyargas Nuur in the Basin of Great Lakes is the ultimate sink of a sequential water and sediment cascade from the adjacent Mongolian Altai and Khangai Mountains. Several intercalated lakes repeatedly joined as one major paleolake, as evidenced by various morphological shoreline features. Situated in the mid-latitude Westerlies-dominated climate regime of Arid Central Asia and affected by the distant effects of the East Asian Summer Monsoon, the dynamic climate of the Basin of Great Lakes is determined by the co-evolution of these atmospheric circulation systems. Our observations comprise 11 distinct paleolake levels between +7 m and +188 m above modern lake level (aml). Calculations of paleolake extent and water volume emphasize the periodically enhanced inflow and gradual capture and abandonment of upstream-located lakes. In the regional to global paleoclimatic context, our results reveal three distinct phases of lake level dynamics: (i) A transgression to a maximum level of +129 m aml during Marine Isotope Stage 5c (104.7 +/- 14.4-88.8 +/- 12.7 ka) primarily controlled by increased atmospheric moisture supply from the Westerlies. (ii) A post-Last Glacial Maximum lake expansion to a level of +118 m aml around 14 ka, ultimately controlled by enhanced glacial meltwater discharge into the basin. This is followed by a lake regression throughout the late Glacial to early Holocene transition in response to a gradually decreasing meltwater supply and a drier climate. (iii) A late Holocene transgression to +15 m aml reflecting a general Holocene wetting trend across arid Central Asia, followed by small-scale level fluctuations post 2.6 ka.

The results of this study can facilitate the assessment of the tourist potentials of both locations by the tourism industry, tour operators, and tourists. The evaluation is based on an analysis of the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) and parameters presented through the Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information Scheme (CTIS) for the period 1991-2020. The CTIS data reveal that better conditions in terms of thermal comfort can be found during the warm period from May to September at both sites. The results show that the highest frequency of all grades of heat stress are observed in the last 10-day period of July and in the first 10-day period of August at both stations, but at Odesa, the frequency of heat stress of any grade is approximately 10% higher than at Svityaz. The frequency of moderate, strong and extreme heat stress during the daytime in July and in the first two 10-day periods of August at Odesa ranged from 51.3% to 66.5%, and at Svityaz it ranged between 40.2 and 54.6%. Human-biometeorological conditions during heat waves are more strenuous at Odesa. The frequency of days with extreme heat stress at 12 UTC during summer heat waves is 48.4% at Odesa and 35.6% at Svityaz. The results show a higher frequency of thermal stress at Odesa, which makes this resort less comfortable for people vulnerable to heat stress.					; Matzarakis, Andreas/AAO-2676-2021; Shevchenko, Olga/AAU-3503-2021; Gryniuk, Oleg/ABF-2921-2021; Snizhko, Sergiy/ABI-3095-2020; Matzarakis, Andreas/E-4738-2012	Snizhko, Sergiy/0000-0002-2696-687X; Matzarakis, Andreas/0000-0003-3076-555X; Gryniuk, Oleg/0000-0002-0758-9618; Shevchenko, Olga/0000-0003-3915-427X														2073-4433				MAR	2023	14	3							460	10.3390/atmos14030460	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14030460													WOS:000955195100001

The samples were analyzed with thin-section, XRD, and chemical analyses (ICP-MS) to determine their chemical and mineralogical properties. In the study area, partially lithified volcano-sedimentary rocks comprised paleosol, calcrete, gravel, sand, silt, mud, clay, and volcanoclastics such as pumice fall-out. Grain size analyses from the Zengen (P1) and Altunhisar (P2) regions showed very poor sorting and strong positive skewness. The Zengen-area (P1) samples contained rock fragments, calcite, quartz, opal-CT, feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene, biotite, and clay minerals such as smectite, chlorite, illite, palygorskite, and sepiolite. In calcrete zones, however, the amounts of CaO increased, whereas significant decreases in the amounts of SiO2 were observed. Therefore, a negative correlation between SiO2 and CaO was observed. The vertical distributions and behaviors of trace elements in the Zengen-area profile showed variation with the different levels of the P1 section. It is thought that in the Bor Plain, after 17,000 years ago, no lacustrine phase reached a level above the periglacial lake level in the region, reaching this level with the melting of the ice sheets in the area. During the late glacial period, shallow freshwater lacustrine phases and paleosols were identified from 12,500 to 11,000 yr BP in the basin.

Landscape heterogeneity and response of lake ecosystems to changes in climate and peatland expansion over the past 7500 years at the tundra-forest border of northern Manitoba, Canada	HOLOCENE												Responses of Arctic lakes to climate change are complex and heterogeneous at regional to local scales, but there are few studies comparing multiple sites within the same landscape. We studied sediment cores recovered from seven lake sites located within the forest-tundra biome of northern Manitoba, Canada. We first used sediment core pollen from the seven sites to reconstruct July temperatures and total annual precipitation for the past 7500 years based on the modern analog technique. Lake responses and peatland expansion were analyzed based on changes in the concentration and quality of organic matter, biogenic silica (bSi), Sphagnum spores, and published peat core basal dates. Changes in sediment organic matter and bSi were concentrated prior to 4500 cal. Yr BP. From 7500 to 3100 cal. Yr BP, July temperatures rose by similar to 3 degrees C, and total annual precipitation fell by 200 mm; there was little change in temperature or precipitation after 3100 cal. Yr BP. Sphagnum spore concentrations exceeded 0.5% at all of the sites at 7500 cal. Yr BP indicating the early presence of peatlands. Spores increased markedly after 4500 cal. Yr BP in agreement with timing of peat basal dates, but the magnitude and timing of changes varied widely among sites likely reflecting local differences in hydrology or topography. The use of hierarchical generalized additive models provided a unified regional pattern of Holocene climate for northern Manitoba, even though lake responses to climate and peatland expansion differed greatly.

Nested piezometers were installed to assess groundwater contributions and obtain water chemistry samples. Soil and geology information came from existing sources. We converted paleo lake levels from published reports to IGLD1985 and calendar years BP for use in analyzing vegetation changes over time using a combination of peat-core plant macrofossils and modern surveys. Piezometer data showed upward discharge, water at 3-m depth had pH 6.9, specific conductivity of 508 lS/cm, and alkalinity 206 mg/L as CaCO3. Hydraulic head and mineralized water chemistry decreased at shallower depths. Vegetative development began 1790 cal yr BP with sedges and brown moss when land surface was 0.135 m above lake level. Lake levels increased, and by 1590 cal yr BP, water was 0.17 m deep and sedges were joined by shoreline emergent species. Water depth then increased to 0.525 m but began decreasing as lake levels fell. Peatland species appeared around 810 cal yr BP when water depth was reduced to 0.225 m. About 585 cal yr BP, additional peatland species appeared when land surface was 0.075 m above lake level. Sphagnum became prominent 80 cal yr BP (0.81 m above lake level), representing 67 % mean cover in modern vegetation. Isolation of the surface from calcareous groundwater resulted in transition from rich fen to poor fen. These wetlands are rare in the lower Great Lakes and deserve protection of their characteristic hydrology, water chemistry, and vegetation structure. & COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y				Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y			Population dynamics of Fraxinus nigra in response to flood-level variations, in Northwestern Quebec	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Population dynamics of black ash (Fraxinus nigra) were investigated in five stands with different exposures to spring flooding at the southwestern limit of Quebec's boreal forest. Fifty-four 100-m(2) plots were sampled along 25 transects laid out perpendicular to Lake Duparquet, In each plot, all black ash >5 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were aged using dendrochronological methods. An age-height regression was used to calculate the age of those individuals <5 cm in dbh. Stump sprouts had a significantly faster height and diameter growth rate than individuals established from sexual origin. Two stands in this study showed deficits in sexual recruitment. One stand, located on a deep organic layer, also showed recent colonization by F. nigra that may have started during the 1930s. This stand had the highest stem density, and sprouting was restricted to the younger age classes. Ordination analysis of dispersion indices characterizing the age distribution of F. nigra indicated a definite pattern toward higher sexual recruitment in plots and stands that were less exposed to flooding. In contrast, poor sexual recruitment was observed on more exposed sites. However, this situation was compensated for by abundant vegetative recruitment, Analysis of the periods of growth release and suppression of 153 trees revealed that F. nigra population dynamics are not regulated by major disturbance events. A general upward trend in radial growth and F. nigra expansion toward higher elevation sites observed since the end of the 19th century may be due to changes in Lake Duparquet's hydrological regime. Increases in the severity of flooding events may result in the decrease in seedling abundance observed in the more exposed stands. F. nigra populations were found to be resistant to long-term natural water fluctuations due to their ability to regenerate both by seeds and by sprouts.																			0012-9615	1557-7015				FEB	1999	69	1					107	125		10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0107:PDOFNI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0107:PDOFNI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078484900005

A data set of the contemporary C-14 distribution of dissolved and particulate organic pools in the water column is presented to address this issue. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC), plankton, suspended particulate organic carbon (POCsusp), sinking POC (POCsink), and bottom sediment organic carbon (SOC) were analyzed. Present-day Delta C-14 values of DIC were measured ranging from -750% in the monimolimnion to atmospheric values in lake surface waters and in spring inlet waters. A range of Delta C-14 values between -200 and -300 parts per thousand was observed for superficial POCsusp, POCsink, SOC, and DOC. This relatively uniform C-14 offset of the exported organic production from the surface waters to the bottom represents a contemporary reservoir effect of similar to 2500 yr. Laminated buried sediment samples and terrestrial vegetal macro-remains were used to evaluate temporal reservoir effect variations since the formation of the crater lake (7 ka cal BP). Buried sediment layers presented a similar offset or showed larger differences between Delta C-14 values of bulk sediment and terrestrial plant remains (-400 to -500 parts per thousand). Furthermore, an almost 0-yr reservoir effect was inferred from the sediment layers deposited just above the volcanic bedrock at the early flooding of the crater, and increasing slightly within the first centuries of the lake's history. A second objective was to tentatively model a defined scenario of the cycling of carbon in the lake capable of predicting a modern reservoir effect. Alternative scenarios were then tested for which a larger contribution of deeper DIC would provide a model compatible with larger past reservoir effects. It is concluded that using Delta C-14 SOC variation in laminated lake sediments as a proxy of paleolimnological conditions may be valuable provided that more data on the dynamics of the C-14 composition of plankton and more detailed sampling of laminated sediment layers are available.					; JEZEQUEL, DIDIER/K-8269-2012	Viollier, Eric/0000-0002-8863-4563; 													0033-8222	1945-5755					2013	55	2-3					1029	1042		10.1017/S0033822200058161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200058161													WOS:000325752100088

An initial oligotrophic lake was formed at the study site c. 9800 - 9500 C-14 yr BP. Although tundra communities dominated the vegetation in the area, birch and larch trees might have grown at lower elevations. Dry and disturbed soil habitats also occurred around the lake. Algae (mostly Pediastrum and Botryococcus) started to expand in the lake as climate gradually improved after c. 9500 C-14 yr BP. However, the role of mosses (mostly Calliergon and Drepanocladus) was most important for the infilling of the lake basin. Increased temperatures and subsequent improvement of hydrological conditions resulted in vegetation changes: stands of willows developed rapidly and the role of tree birch in the local vegetation increased. The lake was completely filled at c. 8600 C-14 yr BP. Peat accumulation started with Bryales mosses and, later, Sphagnum became dominant. Stands of Larix, Picea and Betula became well developed during the Boreal climate optimum. Tree birch began to spread into the tundra. Different Bryales mosses formed peat c. 8000 - 6500 C-14 yr BP. Cyperaceae later became the main peat-forming element. Dense spruce canopies with Larix sibirica and Betula pubescens surrounded the study site during the Atlantic period, pointing to the warmest climate during the Holocene. Summer temperatures might have been up to 3 - 4 degrees C higher than today. However, a decline of spruce and an increase of birch around 6700 - 6300 C-14 yr BP may reflect some climate deterioration. There are no dated deposits younger than 6000 C-14 yr BP. It is assumed that Subboreal climate deterioration resulted in the development of permafrost and formation of the palsa at the site. The deposits, now protruding above the surrounding terrain, were eroded by wind, water and cryogenic processes.

Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle Retrieval of Snow Depth Over Freshwater Lake Ice Using Structure From Motion	FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING												The presence and thickness of snow overlying lake ice affects both the timing of melt and ice-free conditions, can contribute to overall ice thickness through its insulative capacity, and fosters the development of variable ice types. The use of UAVs to retrieve snow depths with high spatial resolution is necessary for the next generation of ultra-fine hydrological models, as the direct contribution of water from snow on lake ice is unknown. Such information is critical to the understanding of the physical processes of snow redistribution and capture in catchments on small lakes in the Arctic, which has been historically estimated from its relationship to terrestrial snowpack properties. In this study, we use a quad-copter UAV and SfM principles to retrieve and map snow depth at the winter maximum at high resolution over a the freshwater West Twin Lake on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. The accuracy of the snow depth retrievals is assessed using in-situ observations (n = 1,044), applying corrections to account for the freeboard of floating ice. The average snow depth from in-situ observations was used calculate a correction factor based on the freeboard of the ice to retrieve snow depth from UAV acquisitions (RMSE = 0.06 and 0.07 m for two transects on the lake. The retrieved snow depth map exhibits drift structures that have height deviations with a root mean square (RMS) of 0.08 m (correlation length = 13.8 m) for a transect on the west side of the lake, and an RMS of 0.07 m (correlation length = 18.7 m) on the east. Snow drifts present on the lake also correspond to previous investigations regarding the variability of snow on lakes, with a periodicity (separation) of 20 and 16 m for the west and east side of the lake, respectively. This study represents the first retrieval of snow depth on a frozen lake surface from a UAV using photogrammetry, and promotes the potential for high-resolution snow depth retrieval on small ponds and lakes that comprise a significant portion of landcover in Arctic environments.

J	Hoffmann, M; Johnsson, H; Gustafson, A; Grimvall, A				Hoffmann, M; Johnsson, H; Gustafson, A; Grimvall, A			Leaching of nitrogen in Swedish agriculture - a historical perspective	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												There is a need to examine long-term changes in nitrogen leaching from arable soils. The purpose of this study was to analyse variations in specific leaching rates (kg ha(-1) per year) and gross load (Mg per year) of N from arable land to watercourses in Sweden from a historical perspective. The start of the study was set to 1865 because information on crop distribution, yield and livestock has been compiled yearly since then. The SOIL/SOILN model was used to calculate nitrogen leaching. Calculations were done for cereals, grass and bare fallow for three different soil types in nine agricultural regions covering a range of climatic conditions. Results indicate that both specific leaching rates and gross load of nitrogen in the middle of 19th century were approximately the same as they are today for the whole of south and central Sweden. Three main explanations for this were (1) large areas of bare fallow typical for the farming practice at the time; (2) enhanced mineralisation from newly cultivated land; and (3) low yield. From 1865, i.e. the start of the calculations, N leaching rates decreased and were at their lowest around 1930. During the same period, gross load was also at its lowest despite the fact that the acreage of arable land was at its most extensive. After 1930, average leaching increased by 60% and gross load by 30%, both reaching a peak in the mid-1970s to be followed by a declining trend. The greatest increase in leaching was in regions where the increase in animal density was largest and these regions were also those where the natural conditions for leaching such as mild winters and coarse-textured soils were found. Extensive draining projects occurred during the period of investigation, in particular an intensive exploitation of lakes and wetlands. This caused a substantial drop in nitrogen retention and the probable increase in net load to the sea might thus have been more affected by this decrease in retention than the actual increase in gross load.

These near-term forecasts support proactive management actions, such as sampling and additional monitoring, aligned with the U.S. Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act call for advancements in cyanoHAB forecasting. Accurate forecasting technology could save communities health related costs, monitoring and response resources, and drinking water treatment costs through early detection of cyanoHABs. A hierarchical Bayesian spatiotemporal model predicts cyanoHABs by determining probabilities of weekly lake exceedance of 12 mu g/L chlorophyll a for 2,192 satellite resolved lakes across the contiguous United States. The 2021-2023 predictions from this model were evaluated to determine occurrence of false negative and false positive predictions to update model interpretation. In total, 331,049 events were analyzed, of which false negatives represented 1.34% and false positives 8.06% of forecasts. False negatives were predominantly events lasting 1-3 weeks (wk) in the late fall. False positives varied in temporal length but were typically associated with actual blooms, often incorrectly forecasting blooms before, after, or between actual bloom events. The 3-year model run demonstrated performance consistency and operational readiness. A stoplight approach for probability reporting could improve data visualization. Insights into forecast limitations support transparent communication and stakeholder engagement. This evaluation helps managers interpret model limitations when integrating results into decision frameworks to mitigate cyanoHAB impacts, protecting public and environmental health.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				2025 SEP 2	2025										10.1080/10402381.2025.2551961	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2025.2551961		SEP 2025											WOS:001582443800001

Terrestrial carbon inputs drive methylmercury accumulation in zooplankton of boreal and subarctic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Boreal and subarctic lakes are subject to the climate-sensitive process of browning, whereby transport of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM) to lakes results in greater dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and associated darker water color. Increasing tDOM will increase mercury (Hg) transport to these lakes, but whether this leads to greater methylHg (MeHg) bioaccumulation in food webs remains unclear. We determined whether increasing DOC increased MeHg bioaccumulation in the lower food web (i.e., zooplankton) by measuring a suite of water chemistry characteristics (including aqueous MeHg and DOC) along with stable isotopes of C (delta 13C) and N (delta 15N), fatty acid (FA) profiles, and MeHg content of zooplankton from 16 Scandinavian boreal and subarctic lakes along a DOC gradient in the Fall of 2016. We found that both aqueous and zooplankton MeHg were positively correlated with DOC concentration, and that DOC and zooplankton MeHg both increased with the bacterial FA marker 18:1n-7 and decreased with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) : arachidonic acid and DHA : eicosapentaenoic acid ratios in zooplankton, which are indicators of diet or taxonomic composition. Zooplankton MeHg content was best predicted by delta 13C and the FA 18:1n-7, indicating that zooplankton MeHg bioaccumulation in zooplankton was associated with changes in their resource use along a DOC gradient. Our results suggest that lake browning will likely lead to an increase in MeHg bioaccumulation in zooplankton by affecting aqueous MeHg exposure and lower food web dynamics. In turn, this may lead to increased MeHg contamination in fish and other wildlife.

Hanif; Imran, Jasim			Assessing Flood Attenuation Potential through Reservoir Storage: A Case Study of the 2015 Gills Creek Watershed Flooding	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW												Between October 2 and 5, 2015, central and coastal South Carolina endured intense precipitation, which led to extensive flooding, 36 dam failures, 19 fatalities, and substantial infrastructure damage. Within the 190 km2 Gills Creek Watershed, an unprecedented 424 mm of rain fell in a 24-h span, exceeding the 1,000-year precipitation depth of 319 mm. This phenomenon resulted in three breached dams and 13 dams being overtopped. This research investigates downstream flooding resulting from multiple dam failures and assesses the potential of upstream reservoir storage to mitigate floods across different return periods. Through the use of the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software, extensive hydrologic and two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic analyses were conducted. The propagation of flood waves across five interconnected dam reservoirs, incorporating three breached and two overtopped dams during the October 2015 storm, was investigated. The shapes of dam breaches were established based on postflood field measurements, and breach formation time was computed employing Von Thun and Gillette's parametric equation. The model results show a satisfactory match with observed water levels at Forest Lake Dam and visual observations of flooded storefronts in the City of Forest Acres. The simulations encompassed various storm events-10, 100, 500, and 1,000 years-while considering various combinations of initial pool levels. The results indicated that the prestorm drainage of water from smaller reservoirs, which accounted for 12% of the total reservoir capacities, led to a 24% reduction in peak flood flow during a 1,000-year storm event. However, increasing storage capacity by emptying reservoirs in advance would have a minimal impact on the flooding caused by the October 2015 storm.					; Chaudhry, M/KIL-6896-2024	Nemnem, Ayman/0009-0003-0238-4394; 													1527-6988	1527-6996				AUG 1	2025	26	3							05025006	10.1061/NHREFO.NHENG-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/NHREFO.NHENG-2019													WOS:001509491700026

K.			Investigating remotely piloted aerial application systems for hydrilla management in Florida	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Remotely piloted aerial application systems (RPAAS) are capable of dispensing pesticide payloads that can cover several hectares per day. Hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle] management in Florida's public lakes largely consists of in-water herbicide treatments covering tens of thousands of hectares annually. However, 80% of these treatments are on <35 ha, which falls within RPAAS projected use patterns. Three separate trials were conducted in Florida within hydrilla-infested waterbodies to evaluate the performance of RPAAS administering aquatic herbicides to small plots (0.16 to 0.25 ha) using solid-stream nozzles. The first trial compared flight spacing influence (i.e., 2.5, 5, or 10 m), applying florpyrauxifen-benzyl targeting 38 <mu>g active ingredient (a.i.)/L in the upper 0.91 m of the water column. The 2 additional trials compared 3 herbicides (florpyrauxifen-benzyl, endothall, and diquat) alone and in combination at standard application rates using a fixed RPAAS flight spacing (2.5 m). Results from trial 1 indicated the 2.5 m spacing was the least efficient or effective treatment evaluated. For all trials, the hydrilla canopy suppression at 9 (trial 1) and 11 (trials 2 and 3) weeks after treatment were not considered operationally effective (<= 75% of control) at tested conditions, although initial phytotoxic injury to hydrilla was observed. Less than desired herbicide activity may be due to rapid herbicide dissipation and degradation pathways rather than RPAAS application failure. Further research with RPAAS application of low-use-rate aquatic herbicides should evaluate the influence of plant maturity on directed in-water applications.

These events prompted multiple rescue attempts through water transport resources, which were unsuccessful due to the effect of volcanic ash on ships' functionality and included consequences as severe as the capsizing of moored vessels. Here, we investigate various methodologies for effectively communicating the lessons learned following the Hudson (1991), Chaiten (2008), Cordon Caulle (2011-2012), and Calbuco (2015) volcanic eruptions and ashfall events. Within this work, we describe the diverse collaborative processes through which the present poster, titled "Volcanic Ash: Advice for the Nautical Sector" (version no. 1) was effectively conceptualized, designed, agreed upon, reviewed, and communicated to ship and port operators in Patagonia Argentina. This communication resource is rooted in and aligns with a suite of posters originally designed to provide guidance across other critical infrastructure service sectors, including road and air transport networks. The poster empirically elaborates on: (1) the hazards to water transport systems associated with the primary fallout of volcanic ash in fluvio-lacustrine waterways; (2) the negative effects of volcanic ash on ports and ships; (3) diverse preparedness strategies; (4) recommended emergency response actions, particularly during and after volcanic ash emission and fallout; and (5) alternative sources of information on volcanic ash impacts. Our primary goal is to provide some critical recommendations for disaster risk reduction and building resilience amongst the nautical sector in Argentine Patagonia in the event of pyroclastic fallouts.																			0326-1735	2313-903X					2024	46				SI																			WOS:001416103000001

Citizen science data validates aerial imagery to track the 'rise and fall' of woody vegetation through extremes of climate	PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Context. Ground truthing remotely sensed imagery for detecting changes in wetland vegetation can be time-consuming and costly for monitoring. Harnessing the resources of citizen scientists (CS) using mobile devices has been under utilised in Australia. Aims. The project aimed to test the feasibility and practicality of using CS to collect data using mobile devices to ground truth remotely sensed imagery. Methods. Using high-resolution aerial imagery, we detected the establishment of woody vegetation over a 20-year dry phase from 2000 to 2020 in Thirlmere Lakes National Park, NSW, Australia. To ground truth these woody species, we engaged with a local community group using a customised, freely available mobile device application. Key results. During the dry event of 2020, CS documented well-established woody species, such as Melaleuca linariifolia (flax-leaved paperbark), amongst the Lepironia articulata grey rush. With the La Nina wet events in early 2020-22 and subsequent higher water levels, the CS documented the survival of M. linariifolia but the dieback of eucalypts, and other woody species. Conclusions. Observations at higher temporal frequencies by CS using mobile devices, augmented with researchers' observations, proved to be a valuable, quality-controlled method to ground truth high-resolution aerial imagery. Implications. This case study showed that monitoring the phenology of vegetation in a peat wetland can be supplemented by the inclusion of a CS programme. This under-utilised resource can increase coverage and frequency of data observations, lower costs as well as create community awareness, capability and engagement in scientific research.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the use of phytopigments as markers of the main taxonomic groups of algae, As a first approach, multiple regression of marker pigments against chlorophyll a (chl a) was used to derive the best linear combination of the main xanthophylls (peridinin, fucoxanthin, alloxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin), A significant regression equation (r(2) = 0.98) was obtained for epilimnion data. The good fit indicates that the chi a:xanthophyll ratios were fairly constant in the epilimnion of the nine lakes over time. Chlorophyll a recalculated from the main xanthophylls in each sample showed good agreement with measured chi a in epilimnetic waters, A second approach used the CHEMTAX program to analyze the same data set. CHEMTAX provided estimates of chi a biomass for all algal classes and allowed distinction between diatoms and chrysophytes, and between chlorophytes and euglenophytes. These results showed a reasonably good agreement with biomass estimates from microscope counts, despite uncertainties associated with differences in sampling procedure. Changes of pigment ratios over time in the epilimnetic waters were also investigated, as well as differences between surface and deep samples of Little Rock Lake and Crystal Lake. We found evidence that changes in the ratio of photoprotective pigments to chi a occurred as a response to changes in light climate. Changes were also observed for certain light-harvesting pigments. The comparison between multiple regression and CHEMTAX analyses for inferring chl a biomass from concentrations of marker pigments highlighted the need to take account of variations in pigment ratio, as well as the need to acquire additional data on the pig ment composition of planktonic algae.

C	Boyette, RA; Bergstedt, L		Newcomb, DE		Boyette, RA; Bergstedt, L			Wastewater treatment plant odor control using a biofiltration system in Duluth, Minnesota	COLD REGIONS IMPACT ON CIVIL WORKS					9th International Conference on Cold Regions Engineering	SEP 27-30, 1998	DULUTH, MN	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Tech Council Cold Reg Engn, Amer Soc Civil Engineers Duluth Sect				The Western Lake Superior Sanitary District (WLSSD) owns and operates a 45 million gallon per day capacity regional wastewater treatment plant in Duluth, Minnesota. Because of the severely cold climate, all unit process structures are enclosed. Odorous process offgases from many of these structures must be collected for treatment or dispersion. The treatment plant has had a history of odor problems due to sulfide laden influent principally as a result of the high percentage of kraft paper mill wastewater being received and processed at the plant. The most odorous air emissions from influent channels are routinely incinerated in WLSSD's municipal solid waste/sludge co-disposal incinerator. However, odorous offgases from grit removal and sludge thickening rooms were vented to the atmosphere resulting in ongoing odor complaints from neighboring residents. in response to this problem, WLSSD designed and constructed an open bed biofilter system to treat 44,000 cubic feet per minute of sulfide laden exhaust gases from the grit removal room and the dissolved air sludge thickening room. The design also included the capacity for an additional 6,000 CFM of exhaust gas from the influent screw pump area which was included in 1997. The project was designed and constructed on a fast-track schedule between May and October 1996 to take advantage of the short outdoor construction season in Duluth. Construction was completed, and the system started operating in October 1996. The open bed biofilter system successfully operated in the sub-zero temperatures of Northern Minnesota during the 1996-1997 winter. No noticeable odors have been detected From the biofilter surface since start-up. Performance testing of the system was conducted in March 1997. Exhaust air samples were collected and monitored for odors per ASTM 679-91. The inlet and outlet odor concentration averaged 819 dilutions to threshold (D/T) and 9 D/T, respectively. This resulted in an overall odor removal efficiency of 99%. In addition, inlet and outlet total reduced sulfur compounds were measured in September 1997. This paper presents design, construction, and operating information of this innovative odor control project. Design parameters, air handling, moisture control, media, and cold weather considerations will be discussed. Capital and operating costs as well as odor removal data will also be summarized. Techniques and procedures used to optimize the system's performance and reduce the overall capital and operating expenses will be presented. This paper is significant to the cold region engineering conference because it will present information on the design, construction, and operation of a moist open bed biological system in a subzero climate Information presented will be useful to other engineers evaluating odor control options at waste treatment facilities in cold weather regions.																					0-7844-0379-1				1998							107	118																WOS:000081048500011

Application to Fuente de Piedra Ramsar, Mediterranean Salt Lake (South of Spain)	WATER												This work concerns the case study of a Mediterranean Ramsar salt lake (Fuente de Piedra, southern Spain) that receives the treated wastewater of the local village treatment plant. The wastewater goes through a system of canals, water dams, and three semi-natural ponds that were built in 2005. This work aims to investigate the capacity of the system to assimilate the impact of wastewater effluents on Lake Fuente de Piedra. For this, four points were sampled on 27-29 April 2016, at the inlet and the outlet points of the first and the third semi-natural ponds, with three replicates each. Temperature, pH, and conductivity at the inlet were 19.62 degrees C, 7.99, and 3262.67 mu S/cm, respectively, and increased through the pond system by 7.59%, 8.04%, and 37.34%, respectively. Phytoplankton concentration indicators decreased from the inlet point to the outlet point (chlorophyll a from > 500 to < 20mg/L), as did the biovolume (from > 5 x 10(10) to 4.3 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Zooplankton biovolume, in contrast, increased three orders of magnitude from the inlet (3.5 x 10(7) mu m(3)/mL) to the outlet point (1.6 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Heterotrophic bacteria (1.29 x 10(5) cfu/mL) and faecal enterococci (1033 +/- 351 cfu/100 mL) were high at the inlet point, but decreased at the outlet point by almost three orders of magnitude. Total phosphorous and total nitrogen decreased 40.3% and 23.1% through the pond system. The results showed an improvement in water quality in its passage through the built system. Additionally, as permanent wetlands with acceptable water quality, the water system attracts wild fauna during the dry summer, leading to the conclusion that these semi-natural or artificial wetlands should be extrapolated to other aquatic ecosystems (Mediterranean wetlands) that receive contributions of residual waters. Better functioning of the treatment plant is desirable to improve the conservation of the Ramsar and adjacent wetlands systems.

J	Harrison, SP				Harrison, Sandy P.			Lake levels and climatic change in eastern North America	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Changes in lake levels during the last 12000 years in eastern North America show spatially coherent patterns, implying climatic control. Conditions were generally wetter than today during the late glacial, becoming more arid towards 6000 years BP when most lakes were low. Lakes rose after 6000 years BP, reaching modern levels by about 3000 years BP. These palaeohydrological changes broadly agree with simulated changes in moisture balance derived from experiments with the NCAR Community Climate Model (Kutzbach and Guetter 1986) with changing orbital parameters and lower boundary conditions (sea-surface temperature and ice extent). However, the model simulates maximum aridity at 9000 years BP. Data and model show broadly similar spatial patterns, implying that the lake-level changes can be explained by the changing boundary conditions and their effects on atmospheric circulation. At 12000 years BP most lakes were high because of increased precipitation along the jet-stream storm-track south of the ice sheet. By 9000 years BP, with the much reduced ice sheet, many lakes along the eastern seaboard and in the southeast were lower than present because of greater evaporation due to high summer insolation. The warming of the continental interior generated an enhanced monsoon low in the southwest, causing increased southerly flow which helped to maintain higher lakes in the Midwest. Dry conditions spread eastwards across the Midwest between 9000 and 6000 years BP. This effect is not shown by the model, which continues to bring monsoonal precipitation into the Midwest while simulating enhanced westerly flow and drier conditions further to the west. Such displacements of circulation features are unimportant at the continental scale, but could be significant if general circulation models are used for regional-scale predictions of changes in the moisture balance.					; Harrison, Sandy/ADX-4692-2022	Harrison, Sandy/0000-0001-5687-1903; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	1989	3	3					157	167		10.1007/BF01080366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01080366													WOS:000208441200003

This study investigated diel catch variations of primary fish species in Gehu Lake using monofilament trammel nets from April to November of 2016. Fish sampling occurred monthly, with nets set and fish caught at four-hour intervals in each month. The results showed that significant diel effects and diel x month interaction were found on Chinese silver carp (SC) and diel x month interaction on common carp (CC). Topmouth, humpback, and Wuchang bream (WB) displayed significantly higher catch per unit effort (CPUE) during twilight or daytime than at night, and no diel x month interactions were detected. For Chinese bighead carp (BC), Mongolian redfin (MR), Japanese grenadier anchovy (JGA), and crucian carp, no diel effect and diel x month interaction were observed. The study suggested that most activities occurring in daytime and at twilight were caused by visual orientation to prey for topmouth and humpback, and by the herbivorous feeding habitat of WB. Food competition between BC and JGA may drive a pronounced temporal partitioning of their diel activity. Overnight gillnet fishing could underestimate the population sizes of herbivores, such as WB, and visually oriented predators, for example, humpback, and might not influence the estimation for BC, JGA, and crucian carp. However, its effects on the stock estimation of SC and CC would vary with months. Notably, future winter investigations into diel catch in this lake could potentially augment the conclusions of the present study.																				2410-3888				AUG 14	2025	10	8							409	10.3390/fishes10080409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes10080409													WOS:001558275900001

A watershed fragility index for assessing the vulnerability of river ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Accelerating impacts of climate change have heightened the vulnerability of ecosystems, posing critical challenges to biodiversity conservation. While current climate change vulnerability assessment frameworks provide valuable insights, they often fall short of fully integrating local stressors. This paper introduces the Watershed Fragility Index (WFI), an innovative tool designed to address these gaps by offering a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple stressors. The WFI leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial analysis, Fuzzy logic for handling ecological complexity and variation, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for prioritizing stressors. For a better comprehension of various exposures, 12 factors are assessed - flooding susceptibility, temperature change, wildfire potential, soil type, geology, distance from waterbodies, slope, altitude, land use and cover, distance from roads, watercourse barriers, and forest change. They are organized into different sub-indexes related to natural disturbances, environmental fragility, and anthropogenic stressors. The tool is demonstrated on the Humber River watershed in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, in eastern Canada. The results indicate that certain stressors create vulnerable areas near important lakes. Overall, the watershed is classified predominantly as low fragility. However, the most vulnerable regions, characterized by moderate fragility, are mainly found in the Lower Humber area, which also contains a larger area with roads, watercourse barriers, and steeper slopes. The outputs offer crucial insights to aid environmental planning within the Humber River watershed and can serve as an evaluation tool for other regions. The WFI is a novel tool for policy development, enabling environmental managers and conservationists to create targeted and adaptive strategies that enhance habitat and species resilience through comprehensive and integrated assessment.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that the strain HBU208002(T) fell within the genus Polymorphospora and was closely related to Polymorphospora rubra JCM 14904(T) (99.73% identity). However, the average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average amino acid identity (AAI) values between the strain HBU208002(T) and P. rubra JCM 14904(T) were 91.78, 44.7 and 91.6%, respectively, which were lower than the ANI (95-96%), DDH (>70%) and AAI (>95%) thresholds of prokaryotic microbial defined species. The predominant fatty acids of the strain HBU208002(T )were iso-C-16:0, C-17:1 omega 8c. The menaquinones of the strain HBU208002(T )were MK-8(H-8) and MK9(H4), while those of P. rubra JCM 14904(T) were MK-10(H-6), MK-10(H-4), MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-4). Meanwhile, some phenotypic characterizations and antibacterial activities distinguished the strain HBU208002T from P. rubra JCM 14904T. The strain HBU208002(T )exhibited inhibitory effects on Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticillioides and Botrytis cinerea, but P. rubra JCM 14904T had no activity. Therefore, the strain HBU208002(T) should be assigned as representing a novel species of the genus Polymorphospora, for which the name Polymorphospora lycopeni was proposed. The type strain is HBU208002(T) (=KCTC49833T = GDMCC4.236T).																			1466-5026	1466-5034					2024	74	10							006543	10.1099/ijsem.0.006543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.006543								39401059					WOS:001343390400001

In terms of their developmental positions and relationships, the denudation system, depositional system, and transportation system consist of source-to-sink systems. Based on the field-investigation evidence and literature survey, it was confirmed that the developmental processes of these "source-to-sink" systems can be divided into three stages: the Early-Late Pleistocene stage, from 39 to 23 ka BP; Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene stage, from 39 to 10.7 ka BP; and modern stage. At the present time, these stages can still be identified as three levels of lake shore terraces. In the Late Pleistocene, the source-to-sink system indicates that the lake level was high, supply of clasts was sufficient, fan deltas had formed, and the lakeside plain continued to develop. At the end of the Late Pleistocene, with the sudden changes in global climate, the climate was dry and cold, and the lake level fell. At this time, the source-to-sink system showed that lake level was relatively low, supply of clasts was reduced, and transportation distance was longer; ancient sediments started to recycle in this system. Until modern times, alluvial fans in the south bank of Qinghai Lake have only rarely been developed, and the supply of clasts is primarily derived from the recirculation of paleo-shore sediments. Meanwhile, a large amount of sandy gravel beaches developed along the lake shore. By studying the multistage source-to-sink systems around modern lakes, the characteristics of the system in lake basins are enriched and provide an important analogy for researches of ancient lake basins.																			2324-8858	2324-8866				FEB	2018	6	1					T109	T126		10.1190/INT-2017-0005.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/INT-2017-0005.1													WOS:000443642000005

Anisotropic elastocreep in glacial ice: A mechanism for intergranular melt and recrystallization	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												[1] Bonded ice crystals under pressure are in a heterogeneous stress state because of the mechanical anisotropy of constituent grains. This condition plays a role in intergranular melt and recrystallization, which in turn influence properties such as permeability and biologic habitability. To examine this, we develop an anisotropic elastocreep model simulating subgrain- scale stresses in polycrystalline ice, choosing in particular the thermal and deformational regime of the Lake Vostok accretion ice. A critical assumption with regard to localized melting is the macroscopic deviatoric stress. Our calculations indicate that for a macroscopic deviatoric stress of 50 kPa, ice at 0.04 degrees C below the bulk melting temperature would contain regions, at scales similar to 1% the grain size, where the liquid phase is thermodynamically favored. This translates to scales of similar to 5 mm in the lower few meters of the Vostok accretion under a deviatoric stress that is plausible near the lake perimeter. Less internal melting is indicated in analyses of ice relatively far from the lake margins due to the assumed presence of lower macroscopic deviatoric stress. Simulated strain energy jumps of 1 - 2% across grain boundaries of accretion ice near the lake boundaries are large relative to free surface energy, indicating the importance of the former in boundary migration recrystallization. Collectively, these findings are consistent with measured dislocation densities (> 10(7) - 10(10) m(-2)) and irregular grain morphologies found in core samples. The calculated melting point depressions associatedwith anisotropy fall short of experimental values by a factor of similar to 2, while the calculated strain rates deviate by similar to 20%.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				AUG 1	2008	113	F3							F03010	10.1029/2007JF000917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JF000917													WOS:000258154500001

Local variation of haemoparasites and arthropod vectors, and intestinal protozoans in spiny mice (Acomys dimidiatus) from four montane wadis in the St Katherine Protectorate, Sinai, Egypt	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Haemoparasite infections and infestations with potential arthropod vectors were assessed in spiny mice Acomys dimidiatus from four wadis in the arid montane region of the southern Sinai in Egypt in late summer 2000. Five taxa of haemoparasites (Haemobartonella spp. 80%, Hepatozoon sp. 20.6%, Trypanosoma acomys 17.5%, Bartonella spp. 2.5% and Babesia sp. 1.9%) were recorded. Additionally, infections with two intestinal protozoa, Cryptosporidium cf. parvum and Giardia sp., were quantified, both with similar prevalence (17.0 and 17.6%, respectively). 17.9% of mice carried fleas (Parapulex chephrensis and Xenopsylla dipodilli) and 32.1% had lice (Polyplax oxyrrhyncha and Polyplax brachyrrhycha combined). Marked differences in the prevalence and abundance of infections were detected between the four wadis, particularly with respect to T. acomys, Hepatozoon sp. and fleas, which were largely aggregated in just two of the four sites (Wadis Gharaba and Tlah). In contrast, the intestinal protozoa were more common, and abundance was higher, in Wadi El Arbaein. Intrinsic factors also contributed to a variation in prevalence, with strong age-dependent increases in the prevalence and abundance of Hepatozoon sp., higher mean species richness, prevalence of Cr. cf. parvum, and abundance of Giardia sp. and Hepatozoon sp. in female mice. Haemobartonella spp. showed an age-dependent reduction in abundance and higher abundance among male mice. A weak association was found between the prevalence of T. acomys and its putative flea vector. The single extrinsic factor in the study, site of capture, was more important than the intrinsic factors in explaining variation in the prevalence and abundance of haemoparasites, intestinal protozoa and arthropod vectors. In the high mountains of southern Sinai, the parasite fauna of spiny mice is distinct in each wadi, and hence we expect the parasites to exert spatially different co-evolutionary pressures on their hosts, with a resultant variation in host life histories.					; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015; Bednarska, Małgorzata/ABF-9465-2020; Gilbert, Francis/K-3817-2013	Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Gilbert, Francis/0000-0002-2727-4103; Zalat, Samy/0000-0002-7929-4923													0952-8369	1469-7998				SEP	2006	270	1					9	24		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00089.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00089.x													WOS:000239778900002

It was shown that the sediments in the elongated about 3 m high yardangs, previously described as remnants of Holocene lake sediments, are Tertiary reworked sediments with a mixed assemblage of foraminifera. The playa is underlain by Chalk and the youngest marine sediments are Eocene in age. The redeposition of the sediments took place in a lake after the lowering of the sea-level. Radiocarbon ages of ostrich egg shell from the playa, and from similar playas in the same region, with ages between about 9000 BP and 6500 BP, all fall within the Holocene humid phase in the Western Desert of Egypt. Between 8000 BP and 7000 BP there was a shallow lake in the studied playa, as indicated by changes in the delta(13)C values of the ostrich egg shell samples. Two radiocarbon ages at about 18,300 BP and 19,700 BP of the fresh-water gastropod Melania tuberculata, found at the surface of ponds of an irrigation system at the margin of the playa, are interpreted as being too old as a result of the hard-water effect on the shell dates caused by the underlying Chalk. The ages cannot therefore be used as evidence of a pre-Holocene humid phase with an extensive lake. The features in the playa and the yardangs indicate that the latter were eroded well before the Holocene and that the surface between the yardangs in the basin has been exposed during the Quaternary before, for instance, the artifacts, including aeolianized late Acheulian handaxes, were left on the surface.																			0168-6208		90-5410-451-1				1998	25						121	131																WOS:000080072900012
J	BESTLAND, EA; RETALLACK, GJ				BESTLAND, EA; RETALLACK, GJ			VOLCANICALLY INFLUENCED CALCAREOUS PALEOSOLS FROM THE MIOCENE KIAHERA FORMATION, RUSINGA ISLAND, KENYA	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Miocene Kiahera Formation at its type locality on Rusinga Island in the Kenyan part of Lake Victoria consists of a sequence of alluvial sedimentary and pyroclastic strata and calcareous palaeosols. The 80 m thick formation was formed by braidplain aggradation and pyroclastic airfall in response to volcanism from the nearby Kisingiri volcano. Numerous fining-upward sequences approximately 5 m to 15 m thick make up the bulk of the Kiahera Formation. A complete sequence contains sandy and conglomeratic beds at the base which fine upward to sandy siltstones, calcareous palaeosols and airfall tuffs. The fining-upward sequences may have been produced by aggradation during phases of volcanic eruption. During major eruptive episodes, scoriaceous nephelinite detritus flooded the alluvial system to create the lower, coarse-grained beds. As eruptive activity waned, airfall ash and overbank flood deposits accumulated on the landscape forming the upper, fine-grained beds of the sequence. Calcareous soils formed on these highly alkaline ashes between large ash fall events. The calcareous palaeosols are grouped broadly into two main types: tuffaceous clayey Inceptisols with distinct Ck horizons (Chido palaeosols) and sandy Inceptisols consisting of nephelinitic rock fragments and subordinate amounts of tuff (Okoto palaeosols). Both types show only weak to moderate soil development interpreted to be a result of episodic rejuvenation by fresh airfall ash and flood deposits. Comparison of depth of the calcareous subsurface horizon from these palaeosols with those in calcareous modern soils from the Serengeti Plain that also developed on alkaline volcanic ash allow for rainfall estimates of between 550 mm a-1 to 750 mm a-1 for the Kiahera palaeosols. This together with root traces, soil structure, and major element chemistry of the two palaeosol types are evidence of a landscape with sandy, stream-side woodland soils (Okoto palaeosols) and clayey, floodplain grassy woodland soils (Chido palaeosols).

Contributions of Great Salt Lake Playa- and Industrially Sourced Priority Pollutant Metals in Dust Contribute to Possible Health Hazards in the Communities of Northern Utah	GEOHEALTH												Communities and ecosystems of northern Utah, USA receive particulate pollution from anthropogenic activity and dust emissions from sources including the Great Salt Lake ("the Lake") playa. In addition to affecting communities, anthropogenic pollution is delivered to the Lake's playa sediments, which are eroded during dust events. Yet, spatial variability in dust flux and composition and their risks to human health are poorly understood. We analyzed dust in 17 passive samplers proximal to the Lake during fall 2022 for dust flux, the dust fraction of particulate matter, 87Sr/86Sr, and elemental geochemistry. We evaluated spatial patterns of 11 priority pollutant metals and estimated the hypothetical non-cancer dust and soil ingestion health hazard for six age cohorts. We observed the highest dust fluxes proximal to the Lake's playa. The highest concentrations of and greatest number of metals occurred in and south of Ogden, UT. Sites to the northeast of Farmington Bay had the highest fluxes. Metal concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr suggest that the dust composition near Bountiful represents contributions from anthropogenic sources, whereas the dust composition to the northeast of Farmington Bay reflects the Lake's playa emissions. Evaluations of potential health hazards from dust ingestion suggest that children between birth and 6 years are vulnerable at higher ingestion rates. Thallium, As, Pb, Co and Cr contributed most to the estimated hazard. Among these, As and sometimes Pb are likely derived from the Lake's playa emissions. Thus, suppression of dust emissions from the Lake's playa may decrease possible health risks for children in northern Utah.					; Daniel, Jones/ABD-5429-2020	Putman, Annie/0000-0002-9424-1707; Jones, Daniel/0000-0003-0724-8001													2471-1403					AUG 5	2025	9	8							e2025GH001462	10.1029/2025GH001462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GH001462								40765640					WOS:001543958100001

Ecological risk assessment of heavy metal pollution in reservoir sediments from major climatic zones of Sri Lanka. Lake Reserv Manage. XXX-XXX.Trace element contamination in sediments and water poses a significant risk to human and ecological well-being. These elements often accumulate in sediments, acting as the primary repository for heavy metals in aquatic settings. Enrichment Factor (EF) quantifies the impact of both natural and human sources on trace element levels in reservoirs. Surface sediments (0-5 cm) were collected from 67 non-urban, shallow, and small-scale village reservoirs across Sri Lanka's 3 main climatic zones (Wet, Dry, and Intermediate). Using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrophotometer (ICPMS), trace element concentrations were determined and compared with standard reference levels to assess sediment contamination. Overall, the average concentrations of trace elements fell within recommended sediment quality guidelines across all climatic zones, suggesting no significant anthropogenic impact from various sources. However, sediment EF analysis revealed variable values ranging from insignificant to extremely severe enrichment. Specifically, elements such as Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Hg exhibited enrichment in select investigated reservoirs. This situation may stem from both natural phenomena and human activities like soil erosion, agriculture, and domestic practices. The study indicates a potential moderate to very high ecological risk based on the ecological risk potential index. Given that many reservoirs are situated in regions with intensive agricultural activities, the use of agrochemicals likely contributes to trace element accumulation in reservoirs and sediment. This research offers valuable background insights into environmental stresses, aiding future contamination assessments.

Assessing the Risk of Internal Loading of Phosphorus from Drinking Reservoir Sediments	WATER												The natural process of lake and reservoir eutrophication through nutrient accumulation within sediments has been accelerated through anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and, especially, phosphorus (P). Stored nutrients can result in significant internal loading (during periods of low sediment redox potential or elevated pH), which may drive poor water quality despite best practices in catchment management. Internal P loading can promote proliferation of cyanobacterial and algal taxa responsible for harmful algal blooms (HABs), as well as taste and odour (T&O) and cyanotoxin events. Here, we investigate the sediment and water column P content of eight reservoirs by analysing iron-bound (Fe-P), calcium-bound (Ca-P), and labile P fractions. We find that all but one reservoir demonstrated high iron (Fe) content (27-52 g Fe/kg sediment), suggesting a high Fe-P binding capacity and hence a potentially high susceptibility to redox-mediated internal loading. However, we found no correlation between Fe-P and Fe content in sediments, suggesting the Fe pool was not saturated with P and thus has capacity for further storage. All sites had low levels of labile P (up to 0.14 mg P-PO4/g dry sediment), with the highest pool of P being Ca-bound, which would be expected based on catchment geology and the presence of Ca-minerals which bind P. Currently, within industry, emphasis falls on controlling the external loading of nutrients from the surrounding catchment, often ignoring the critical role of internal loading. However, here, we demonstrate the need to continually monitor sediment P content and potential internal loading as part of the standard monitoring regime used by water companies to inform reservoir management strategies.

In this environment, evaporitic conditions at about 70 ka produced a repetitive alternation of Pm to mm-thick evaporitic and micritic laminae with a varve-like appearance. These precipitates are interpreted as primary features, deposited in a shallow lake that retained limited water in its centre (core MD-32). Elemental and isotope geochemistry of gypsum and micrite laminae show a complex evaporitic environment where initially marine waters evaporated with the input of continental waters compensating for evaporative losses. Reduced continental input could not support a lake of the initial dimensions and the lake contracted to the deepest part of the basin along the north-eastern side of the basin. In a lake with smaller water volume, continental solutes became apparent. While Sr contents and sulfur isotopes indicate marine contributions, strontium isotopes and oxygen isotopes in sulfates reveal continental inputs and other processes such as recycling of previously precipitated evaporites, sulfate reduction and potential reservoir effects. Carbonate- delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in micritic levels also reveal a continental influence and perhaps variations in organic matter signatures associated with climatic variations and vegetation changes. The REE-normalized patterns in gypsum samples are like those found in northern Cape York rivers, restricting the potential continental inputs into the evaporatic basin to a limited geographical area. The small depletion in LREE-normalized patterns between gypsum and river samples is interpreted as a marine influence while depletions in HREE are considered to be the result of fractionation of HREE during gypsum crystallization. The thickness of the calcite-gypsum couplets is consistent with those precipitated annually in modem evaporitic environments. This and the marked fluctuation between dry (gypsum laminae) and wet (micritic layer) environments, suggests a reduced monsoon-like rainfall pattern operating in northern Australia during evaporite precipitation.

J	Blanch, SJ; Walker, KF; Ganf, GG				Blanch, SJ; Walker, KF; Ganf, GG			Water regimes and littoral plants in four weir pools of the River Murray, Australia	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The composition and distribution of littoral vegetation in four weir pools of the lower Murray were surveyed in summer 1994. Between-weir gradients in the amplitude of water level fluctuations were reflected in the typical distributions of plants, with a 4-6 m elevational range in upper-pool sites, where levels fluctuate most, and a 1-1.5 m band in the lower-pool sites, where levels are more stable. Forty-one of 48 species occurred across much of the longitudinal x elevational site matrix within this cone-shaped distribution, indicating considerable tolerance to flooding and exposure; this was especially apparent for Phragmites australis, Cyperus spp. and Centipeda spp. The 41 species were represented in seven of nine water-regime groups identified by cluster analysis. The remainder, found within +/- 1 m of the water surface in lower-pool reaches, were aquatic macrophytes such as Vallisneria americana and Typha spp, and amphibious 'mudmats' such as Glossostigma elatinoides. Water regimes at given sites were measured by the number of days in 2 years flooded to any depth (> 0 cm), or to 0-30 cm, and by days exposed by > 100 cm. Inter-pool differences in the median number of days flooded to > 0 cm and 0-30 cm were 3-30% and < 8%, respectively, for all species except Typha spp. but an order of magnitude for the number of days exposed by > 100 cm. However, eight of 14 common or representative species analysed showed significant inter-pool differences in the number of days flooded to > 0 cm, indicating that sufficient variation exists to necessitate considerable intra-pool replication to allow for the detection of statistical differences in a multi-pool experiment. The practice of maintaining stable weir pool levels limits vegetation processes, e.g. germination, recruitment, decomposition. An increase in the amplitude of river level fluctuations during low flows, from the current 10-20 cm range to 20-50 cm, would reinstate water regimes suitable to the majority of species surveyed.

Deep central and southeastern areas of the lake exhibited relatively high C deposition, even though deep areas with low C content were also found. Lake Berendonck had a mean +/- standard deviation sediment accumulation rate of 0.7 +/- 0.5 cm year- 1, with areal OC and IC accumulation rates ranging between 24 and 557 and 3-37 g m- 2 year- 1, respectively. Lake Berendonck's mean sediment OC accumulation rate (155 g m- 2 year- 1) was approximately four times higher than the mean OC accumulation rate of global lakes (37 g m- 2 year- 1), while Lake Berendonck's mean IC accumulation rate (12 g m- 2 year- 1) falls in the mid-range for global lakes and seas.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that C accumulation is highly variable in space and that spatially integrated data are needed to estimate C stocks and unravel within-lake C processes reliably. Furthermore, this study highlights that the OC accumulation in Lake Berendonck ranks among the highest rates observed in global lakes with similar surface areas (0.4-0.5 km2). This underscores the global importance of small urban water bodies in C cycling, particularly as key C storage systems.

The late Pleistocene was dominated by sub-arid to arid climate interspersed with short periods of warm and humid conditions that impacted the vegetation cover and landscape. This study used sedimentological variations in a sediment core, supported by geochemical and mineralogical characteristics, to reconstruct climate change impacts and water-level fluctuations in the playa. These changes were inferred using grain-size data, magnetic susceptibility, total organic matter content, carbonate content, elemental concentrations, and mineralogical composition in a C-14-dated sediment core. Based on the inferred water level fluctuations in the playa, the core was divided into two major units. Unit 2 belonged to the late Pleistocene, characterized by a cold and dry climate. In contrast, Unit 1 was deposited during the Holocene, a time marked by prevailing warm and humid conditions, with short periods of intense dust storms. Since the late Holocene, the IOSM (Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon) has played a dominant role in regional climate. Water-level fluctuations related to humidity significantly influenced the sedimentological variables, including grain-size distribution, sorting, skewness, and roundness. During cold and arid conditions, the water level was low, and coarse sediments were deposited in the playa, with low organic matter content, low concentrations of Cu, Mn, P, and V, and evaporite minerals. In contrast, high organic matter content, presence of illite, and high concentrations of Cu, Mn, P, and V and low values of ICV (Index of Compositional Variability) imply a warm and humid climate during the Holocene. The paleoclimate reconstruction in the playa provides evidence about ongoing changes that are closely related to the paleohydrological conditions in this region.

Identifying and classifying Great Lakes ship transits using a state machine approach	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Invasive, aquatic organisms have entered the North America Great Lakes from ships' ballast water, often originating from Europe. Current approaches for preventing the introduction of such organisms in ballast water include ballast water treatment (BWT) or ballast water exchange (BWE). This paper examines BWE, which is conducted in (1) waters >200 nautical miles (nm) from shore, or (2) waters >50 nm from shore and >200 m deep. We used historical records of ships transiting from Europe to the Great Lakes during one year (2014) to determine the duration (in days) that ships were within waters that met the criteria for BWE. Ship paths were classified based upon transitions between location-assigned "states" (e.g., from European waters across the North Atlantic Ocean to North America), and from these state transitions, four types of routes were identified. On average, ships sailing these routes had between 3.5 and 4.7 d to perform BWE in areas >200 nm from shore and 4.7 to 6.2 d when >50 nm from shore and >200-m deep water. Conducting BWE in daylight hours, if deemed necessary for safety, shortened the time window for BWE, especially in winter months, by approximately 50-70%. The state "machine" approach could, in the future, be used to identify ships from specific regions (e.g., ports within waterways at high risk of harboring potentially invasive species). Reshaping the definition of regional boundaries based upon time-of-year, water temperature, or other variables would further refine the ability to identify high-risk transits.

Glacial and seismic events investigation from a single-station record at Severnaya Zemlya archipelago (Arctic region)	JOURNAL OF SEISMOLOGY												The new permanent seismic station SVZ started working in Arctic (Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, Bolshevik Island), we discuss the first results of the local seismicity study. We have processed 46 local seismic events for 2017-2022. Data processing using a single seismic sensor is difficult, but using waveforms and spectral-temporal analysis of P, S, and surface waves, it is possible to separate shallow earthquakes from glacial events. We distinguish two types of icequakes-glacier-related events and pulses. An increase in seismic background noise is related to processes of glacial nature in summertime. Data processing allows to obtain the main peculiarities of local seismicity, i.e., mutual connection of glacial processes and crustal seismicity. We show the presence of icequakes induced by local crustal events; their epicenters confined to the ice domes edges. Spatio-temporal sequence and the rate of events migration show that the glacial events are a result of the defusing deformations process in the glaciers caused by the impact of shallow tectonic earthquakes. Thousands of pulsed and high-frequency micro-oscillations associate with the sea ice sheet or lake ice. The temporal variation of events' number and energy per day correlates with air temperature temporal variations. Moreover, there is a sharp increase in the number of pulses with sharp temperature changes. The greatest activity of this pulsed events is in winter and especially in March, connected with ice surface destruction. In case a network deployment is not feasible, even a single seismic station allows to get a useful information about the glacial and seismic processes.

Weak Effects of Density on Mean Length at Age and Condition ofLargemouth Bass at Large Alabama Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We examined evidence for density-dependent growth of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides in the recruited life stage (age 2 and older) at eight large (>4,000 ha) Alabama reservoirs from standardized electrofishing survey data. Using mean length at age as a measure of cumulative growth and electrofishing catch rates as the basis for a cumulative index of density, we found weak support for the hypothesis that mean length at age was inversely related to Largemouth Bass density. The mean length at age of age-5 Largemouth Bass was positively related to the cumulative density index, which is inconsistent with the prediction of an inverse association under compensatory density dependence. Moreover, the strength of the effect was weak, with a 9-mm increase in mean length at age per 100% increase in the density index. No other age-classes (ages 2 through 6 were examined) exhibited density-dependent mean length at age. Similarly, relative weight was unrelated to the density index. Analyses of changes in mean length at age, relative weight, and the density index over time indicate that each of these variables have increased slightly since the mid-1990s for some age-classes. Our analysis of Largemouth Bass mean length at age at these reservoirs suggests that strong density-dependent growth responses are unlikely in the recruited life stage at these large reservoir systems. If this is the case, implementing minimum length limits at these reservoirs is likely to avoid unintended negative consequences for Largemouth Bass growth and size structure.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2018	38	2					281	294		10.1002/nafm.10016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10016													WOS:000430674400002

CONFIRMATION OF THE SOUTHWEST CONTINUATION OF THE CAT SQUARE TERRANE, SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN INNER PIEDMONT, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR MIDDLE PALEOZOIC COLLISIONAL OROGENESIS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Detailed geologic mapping, U-Pb zircon geochronology and wholerock geochemical analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that the southwestern extent of the Cat Square terrane continues from the northern Inner Piedmont (western Carolinas) into central Georgia. Geologic mapping revealed the Jackson Lake fault, a similar to 15 m-thick, steeply dipping sillimanite-grade fault zone that truncates lithologically distinct granitoids and metasedimentary units, and roughly corresponds with a prominent aeromagnetic lineament hypothesized to represent the southern continuation of the terrane-bounding Brindle Creek fault. Results of U-Pb SHRIMP geochronology indicate Late Ordovician to Silurian granitoids (444-439 Ma) occur exclusively northwest of the fault, whereas Devonian (404-371 Ma) granitoids only occur southeast of the fault. The relatively undeformed Indian Springs granodiorite (three individual bodies dated 317-298 Ma) crosscuts the fault and occurs on both sides, which indicates the Jackson Lake fault is a pre-Alleghanian structure. However, detrital zircon signatures from samples southeast of the Jackson Lake fault reveal dominant Grenville provenance, in contrast to Cat Square terrane detrital zircon samples from the northern Inner Piedmont, which include peri-Gondwanan (600-500 Ma) and a prominent Ordovician-Silurian (similar to 430 Ma) signature. We interpret the rocks southeast of the Jackson Lake fault to represent the southwestern extension of the Cat Square terrane primarily based on the partitioning of granitoid ages and lithologic distinctions similar to the northern Inner Piedmont. Data suggest Cat Square terrane metasedimentary rocks were initially deposited in a remnant ocean basin setting and developed into an accretionary prism in front of the approaching Carolina superterrane, ultimately overridden by it in Late Devonian to Early Mississippian time. Burial to > 20 km resulted in migmatization of lower plate rocks, forming an infrastructure beneath the Carolina superterrane suprastructure. Provenance patterns support similar to 250 km of Devonian dextral translation of the composite Inner Piedmont, which places the northern portion of the Inner Piedmont adjacent to a suite of similar to 430 Ma plutons in the Virginia Blue Ridge during deposition. The megascopic thrust-nappe structural style of the northern Inner Piedmont, combined with southwest-directed lateral extrusion at mid-crustal depths, may reconcile differences in timing of metamorphism between the Carolina and central Georgia Inner Piedmont and structural contrasts between the Brindle Creek and Jackson Lake faults.

However, certain species, such as the Andean Ibis (Theristicus branickii), have received limited attention regarding their ecological patterns, biology, current distribution, and environmental requirements. This study analyzed observation data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) on the Andean Ibis in four countries to identify and understand critical variables that determine the species' presence, assess the proportion of its habitat within protected areas and identify possible threats to the species. Additionally, this study considered environmental and ecological variables to model ecological niches using the maximum entropy approach in MaxEnt to map the suitable habitat of the species. The findings revealed the extent of suitable Andean Ibis habitats in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. The variables that most determined the presence of the species were: altitude (36.57%), distance to lakes (23.29%) and ecological isothermality (13.34%). The distribution area of the Andean Ibis totaled 300,095.00 km2, spanning both sides of the Andean mountains range. Human activities have left a significant impact on the Andean Ibis habitat, with 48% of this area impacted by the human footprint and only 10% of the territory falling within protected areas designated by the respective countries. The results of this study show that the Andean Ibis presents characteristics of a specialist species due to its adaptation to the climate conditions of the plateau and highlands, including low temperatures, herbaceous vegetation and the presence of water bodies. The species is distributed in disconnected Andean landscape areas, whose functionality could be compromised by increased human activities. Complementary studies will be necessary to understand the ecological role and effectiveness of protected areas for conserving the species.

The delta C-13 of POM in Ishikari river ranged from -34.6 to -24.6 parts per thousand, suggesting that contributions from the C-4-based vascular plant organic matter was negligible and detritus from C-3 plants and C-3 plant dominated soil and fresh water phytoplankton contributes the POM load in Ishikari river system. The delta N-15 isotopic ratio of POM ranged from -4.8 to +15.8 parts per thousand, with an average of 4.5 +/- 4.3% in the Ishikari river system. The delta N-15 ratio of sediment samples range from -0.92 to +8.71 parts per thousand, with an average value of 3.8 +/- 2.5% in the Ishikari river system. The delta N-15 isotopic ratio of POM samples taken from Barato lake - an Oxbow lake in Ishikari river - shows strong inverse relation with the dissolved nitrate concentration in the lake water indicating that significant portion of the POM being derived from phytoplankton that were utilizing nitrate that had been subjected to denitrification. The molar C/N ratio of POM sample ranged from 5.3 to 17.8, with an average of 9.8 +/- 2.8 in the Ishikari river system. The correlation plots between molar C/N ratio and N isotopic ratio indicates that most of the POM samples fall between mixing zone of aquatic source (phytoplankton) and terrestrial source (soil organic matter and plant detritus) in Ishikari river system.						jha, pawan kumar/0000-0002-4838-2875															978-1-61499-540-1; 978-1-61499-539-5				2015							219	242		10.3233/978-1-61499-540-1-219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-540-1-219													WOS:000473125200014

Recovery of Soil Macrofauna and Litter Properties in Post-Agrogenic Soils of Spruce Forests of the Smolensk Lakeland National Park	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The recovery of large soil invertebrates (macrofauna) associated with changes in the properties of the litter during natural spruce reforestation on post-agrogenic weakly acid sandy/silty loam soils in the Smolensk Lakeland National Park (western part of Russia) is studied. This work is based on the data of the study of the chronosequence including the following stages: E0, young fallows and agrocenosis; E1, perennial meadows; E2, young birch forests of 10-30 years of age; E3, middle-aged birch forests (36-64 years old) with spruce dominance in the lower woody layer; E4, forests with birch dominance (70-80 years old) and spruce emergence in the upper woody layer; E5, spruce-birch forests (80-100 years old) with the formation of window mosaics due to birch loss; E6, conditionally indigenous spruce forests 90-100 years old with pronounced window mosaics and windfall-soil complexes. It is shown that the litter stocks and the thickness, the carbon content in it increase during reforestation. In agrocenoses and young fallows, the organogenic horizon is fragmentary and is represented by the fall of current years. Litter consisting of material in an intermediate state of decomposition (Oe horizon) appears in young birch forests. Organic material in an advanced state of decomposition (Oa horizon) is characteristic of the middle and late stages of spruce reforestation. The diversity of invertebrates inhabiting the litter also increases naturally. The diversity of the epigeic macrofauna increases: earthworms appear and the number and biomass of other saprophages (bipedal millipedes, molluscs) and predators (spiders, beetles, labiopods) increase. A positive correlation between the thickness of the Oa horizon and the biomass of epi-endogeic earthworms was found.

Evaluation of optimal dose and mixing regime for alum treatment of Matthiesen Creek inflow to Jameson Lake, Washington	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												An innovative method of reducing external phosphorus ( P) loading to lakes uses engineered systems to treat lake inflows with aluminum sulfate ( alum). In this study we used a series of jar tests to examine the optimal alum dose and mixing regime to remove P from Matthiesen Creek, an important external source of P to Jameson Lake. Matthiesen Creek is a good candidate for alum treatment because the creek runs year round, and the majority of P in the spring-feed creek is in the form of bioavailable dissolved P that can be efficiently captured in alum floc. The mixing regimes in this study mimicked a range of possible treatment scenarios that relied on natural turbulence in the creek or conventional mechanical mixing, and presumed the discharge of alum floc either directly to the lake or to an on-shore settling basin. Jar tests showed that an alum dose of 5 mg-Al/L was sufficient to decrease P from around 0.13 mg-P/L to below 0.02 mg-P/L for most mixing regimes. For all mixing regimes, doses of up to 20 mg-Al/L did not depress pH below the recommended minimum pH of 6. Flash mixing prior to low-intensity mixing did not enhance P removal over low-intensity mixing alone, but flash mixing alone resulted in lower levels of P removal from creek water. Jar testing with a mixture of alum-treated creek water and lake water showed that lake waters tended to inhibit P uptake by alum floc. This, combined with the fact that high pH favors the formation of the aluminate ion which could exhibit chronic toxicity to aquatic biota, suggests that discharge of alum solids directly to the lake should be avoided. We recommend an engineered inflow treatment system on Matthiesen Creek that maintains an alum dose of 5-10 mg-Al/L under moderate mixing conditions (Gt of 1,000-3,000) with alum floc collected in an on-shore settling basin.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2009	25	1					102	110		10.1080/07438140802714510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140802714510													WOS:000269667100008

In this study, the freeze-up date (FUD), break-up date (BUD), and ice cover duration (ICD) of 31 lakes were extracted from a time series of the land water surface temperature (LWST) derived from the combined MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 products for the hydrological years 2001 to 2021. Our analysis showed a high correlation between the ice phenology measures derived by our study and those provided by hydrological records (R2 of 0.89) and public datasets (R-2 > 0.7). There was a notable coherence in lake ice phenology in Northeast China, with a trend in later freeze-up (0.21 days/year) and earlier break-up (0.19 days/year) dates, resulting in shorter ice cover duration (0.50 days/year). The lake ice phenology of freshwater lakes exhibited a faster rate of change compared to saltwater lakes during the period from HY2001 to HY2020. We used redundancy analysis and correlation analysis to study the relationships between the LWST and lake ice phenology with various influencing factors, including lake properties, local climate factors, and atmospheric circulation. Solar radiation, latitude, and air temperature were found to be the primary factors. The FUD was more closely related to lake characteristics, while the BUD was linked to local climate factors. The large-scale oscillations were found to influence the changes in lake ice phenology via the coupled influence of air temperature and precipitation. The Antarctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation correlate more with LWST in winter, and the Arctic Oscillation correlates more with the ICD.						hao, xiaohua/0000-0002-4636-979X														2072-4292				NOV	2024	16	21							4025	10.3390/rs16214025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16214025													WOS:001352727500001

This is the principal road into Norway from the south and Europe, passing through Norway's capital city of Oslo and northwards to the central and northern parts of the country. The new motorway runs through unvarying, flat, spruce and pine forests, but also rich agricultural country. It includes views of spectacular mountain formations with massive boulders, and on several stretches there is a panoramic view of Norway's largest lake, Mjosa, which it crosses twice. The road is about 150 km long, and the budget is EUR 1.4 billion. In the middle of the stretch there is a major intersection offering a choice between Norway's two biggest valleys, Gudbrandsdalen and Osterdalen. And here, at this remote site, stands Kolomoen Bridge, deep within dense evergreen forest but visible from afar in three directions via the road corridors through the forest (Fig. 1). At the bridge, the landscape opens up into a wide clearing with the bridge as the dominant sculptural form in the centre, surrounded by the geometrical layout of the exit roads which form distinctive shapes in the terrain. In the past this intersection was so poorly marked that many vehicles heading for Osterdalen drove past without noticing that there was an exit! The bridge comes as a complete surprise to motorists, and proceeding along the wrong road is now hopefully a thing of the past (Fig. 2).																			1867-0520	1867-0539				DEC	2009	2	4					280	286		10.1002/stco.200910038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stco.200910038													WOS:000219781600011

As a consequence, severe geomorphological processes such as debris avalanches and debris flows, shallow landslides, and over-bank flooding have affected the territory, causing severe damage to human-made structures. The unusual intensity of these phenomena prompted an investigation into their frequency in the past, beyond instrumental time. In the quest for an understanding of whether these phenomena are unprecedented in the region, peat bog and lake deposits were analyzed to infer the frequency of extreme precipitation events that may have occurred in the past. We present the results of a dedicated field campaign performed in summer 2017 at Lake Moo in the northern Apennines, a 0.15 km(2) peat bog located at an altitude of 1130 m a.s.l. During the extreme precipitation event of 13-14 September 2015, several debris flows generated by small streams affected the Lake Moo plain. In such a small drainage basin (<2 km(2)), high-density floods can be triggered only by high-intensity precipitation events. The sedimentary succession (ca. 13 m thick) was studied through the drilling of two cores and one trench. The sequence, characterized by clusters of coarse-grained alluvial deposits interbedded with organic-rich silty clays and peat layers, was analyzed by combining sedimentological, pollen, microanthracological and pedological data with radiocarbon dating (AMS C-14) in an innovative multidisciplinary approach for this area. Original data acquired during the field campaign were also correlated with other specific paleoclimatic proxies available in the literature for the northern Apennines area. We discover that the increase in extreme paleoflooding, associated with coarse-grained deposits similar to the ones observed recently, correlates well with the warm phases of the Holocene Thermal Maximum and with the ongoing warming trend observed that started at the beginning of the last century.

J	Heiri, O; Lotter, AF				Heiri, Oliver; Lotter, Andre F.			How does taxonomic resolution affect chironomid-based temperature reconstruction?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The resolution achievable for chironomid identifications has increased in recent years because of significant improvements in taxonomic literature. However, high taxonomic resolution requires more training for analysts. Furthermore, with greater taxonomic resolution, misidentifications and the number of rare, poorly represented taxa in chironomid calibration datasets may increase. We assessed the effects of various levels of taxonomic resolution on the performance of chironomid-based temperature inference models (transfer functions) and temperature reconstruction. A calibration dataset consisting of chironomid assemblage and temperature data from 100 lakes was examined at four levels of taxonomic detail. The coarsest taxonomic resolution primarily represented identifications to genus or suprageneric level. At the highest level of taxonomic resolution, identification to genus level was possible for 37% of taxa, and identification below genus was possible for 60% of taxa. Transfer functions were obtained using Weighted Averaging (WA) and Weighted Averaging-Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) regression. Cross-validated performance statistics, such as the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and the coefficient of determination (r (2)) between inferred and observed values improved considerably from the lowest taxonomic resolution level (WA: RMSEP 1.91A degrees C, r (2) 0.78; WA-PLS: RMSEP 1.59A degrees C, r (2) 0.86) to the highest taxonomic resolution level (WA: RMSEP 1.66A degrees C, r (2) 0.84; WA-PLS: RMSEP 1.41A degrees C, r (2) 0.89). Reconstructed July air temperatures during the Lateglacial period based on fossil chironomid assemblages from Hijkermeer (The Netherlands) were similar for all levels of taxonomic resolution, except the coarsest level. At the coarsest taxonomic level, reconstruction failed to infer one of the known Lateglacial cold episodes in the record. Also, the difference in reconstructed values based on lowest and highest taxonomic resolutions exceeded sample-specific estimated standard errors of prediction in several instances. Our results suggest that chironomid-based transfer functions at the highest taxonomic resolution outperform models based on lower-resolution calibration data. However, transfer functions of intermediate taxonomic resolution produced results very similar to models based on high-resolution taxonomic data. In studies that include analysts with different levels of expertise, inference models based on intermediate taxonomic resolution, therefore, might provide an alternative to transfer functions of maximum taxonomic detail in order to ensure taxonomic consistency between calibration datasets and down-core records produced by different analysts.

In this study, pot experiment involving rice, anaerobic incubation, and chemical analysis were conducted for paddy soils collected from nine locations in the Taihu Lake region of China. The paddy soils showed large variability in N-supplying capacity as indicated by the total N uptake (TNU) by rice plants in a pot experiment, which ranged from 639.7 to 1,046.2 mg N pot(-1) at maturity stage, representing 5.8% of the total soil N on average. Anaerobic incubation for 3, 14, 28, and 112 days all resulted in a significant (P < 0.01) correlation between cumulative mineral NH (4) (+) -N and TNU, but generally better correlations were obtained with increasing incubation time. Soil organic C, total soil N, microbial C, and ultraviolet absorbance of NaHCO3 extract at 205 and 260 nm revealed no clear relationship with TNU or cumulative mineral NH (4) (+) -N. Soil C/N ratio, acid KMnO4-NH (4) (+) -N, alkaline KMnO4-NH (4) (+) -N, phosphate-borate buffer extractable NH (4) (+) -N (PB-NH (4) (+) -N), phosphate-borate buffer hydrolyzable NH (4) (+) -N (PBHYDR-NH (4) (+) -N) and hot KCl extractable NH (4) (+) -N (H-KCl-NH (4) (+) -N) were all significantly (P < 0.05) related to TNU and cumulative mineral NH (4) (+) -N of long-term incubation (> 28 days). However, the best chemical index of soil N-supplying capacity was the soil C/N ratio, which showed the highest correlation with TNU at maturity stage (R = -0.929, P < 0.001) and cumulative mineral NH (4) (+) -N (R = -0.971, P < 0.001). Acid KMnO4-NH (4) (+) -N plus native soil NH (4) (+) -N produced similar, but slightly worse predictions of soil N-supplying capacity than the soil C/N ratio.					li, wenjun/GSE-5770-2022; XIA, Yongqiu/D-6236-2017; yan, xiao yuan/M-9840-2016; Yan, Xiaoyuan/M-9840-2016	yan, xiao yuan/0000-0001-8645-4836; TI, CHAOPU/0000-0002-6660-8188; 													0178-2762	1432-0789				AUG	2011	47	6					669	678		10.1007/s00374-011-0577-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-011-0577-x													WOS:000292971700006

Soil salinization and sodication, surface soil physical properties, and yield of five soft white spring wheat crops (Triticum aestivum L., var. AC Reed) were examined under alternate applications of simulated rain with saline-sodic irrigation waters ranging from "safe" to "potentially hazardous" for irrigation. Increased salinity and sodicity of irrigation waters alternated with simulated rain resulted in increased salinity and sodicity in the upper 0.60 to 0.90 in of the soil. Salt accumulation in the root zone decreased as the leaching fraction increased. Aggregate stability and infiltration properties of the soil were generally adversely affected by the more saline and sodic irrigation waters. Infiltration properties were significantly greater with irrigation water (IW) than with distilled water (DW). The soil infiltration rate at 2 h, with DW as the infiltrating water, was the most sensitive soil physical property for assessment of irrigation water suitability. The infiltration test after five crop cycles gave a better indication of the effects of excess sodicity of irrigation water on soil structural stability than the aggregate stability test. The cumulative effects of long-term supplemental irrigation with saline-sodic waters on soil chemical and physical properties need to be considered when assessing irrigation water suitability. Irrigation waters with electrical conductivity (EC) less than or equal to 1 dS m(-1) and a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) less than or equal to 5 did not result in deterioration of soil physical properties and were considered "safe" for supplemental irrigation of the Masinasin soil. Alternate applications of irrigation and distilled water should be used to evaluate soil infiltration rates and the structural stability of soils to which saline-sodic waters are to be applied.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				AUG	2002	82	3					297	309		10.4141/S01-080	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-080													WOS:000178606000004

Long-term effects of liming in Norwegian softwater lakes: the rise and fall of bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) and decline of isoetid vegetation	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Acidification has been recognised as a serious environmental problem in Scandinavia since the 1970s, and liming has been the main strategy to counteract negative effects on biota by improving water quality. We studied the short- and long-term effects of liming on sediment and water quality, as well as macrophyte development, by comparing five limed with five unlimed lakes during the period 1993-2013. In the limed lakes, massive development of bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus: Juncaceae) occurred during the first 6-9years after the start of liming (1984-1993). Juncus bulbosus then started to decline around 1999 and eventually reached its original abundance in 2010. In addition, the cover of the original isoetid vegetation declined by around 60% between 1995 and 2010. In contrast, changes in submerged aquatic vegetation in the unlimed lakes were minor. Liming initially stimulated anaerobic breakdown of sediment organic matter with Fe as the electron acceptor. Juncus bulbosus probably benefitted from the higher CO2 fluxes from the sediment to the water layer in combination with a high NH4+ concentration in the limed sediment. However, the organic matter became less reactive over time, thus eventually providing less CO2. Together with the significant increase in water pH over time, this would have led to a decline in C availability in sediment and water, thus discouraging excessive growth of J. bulbosus. This may explain why J. bulbosus thrived only during the first years after liming. The decline of isoetids in limed lakes was probably caused by a combination of uprooting and sediment anoxia. In limed lakes, isoetids developed a shoot:root ratio that was above the threshold known to promote uprooting of these high buoyancy species on organic sediment. In addition, isoetids eventually became covered by algae and dead J. bulbosus, affecting light conditions and suffocating the remaining isoetid vegetation on limed reductive sediments. In the future, renewed excessive growth of J. bulbosus seems unlikely due to the lack of sufficient carbon sources. It remains, however, unclear whether the original isoetids vegetation can recover. We hypothesise that the isoetid Littorella uniflora may eventually recolonise the lake from the shore and improve the oxygen content of limed sediments; this, in turn will facilitate the germination of other plant species, through high radial oxygen loss in combination with asexual reproduction.

The Periglacial Lake Bretjorna (Ledovoe), Western Svalbard: History of Formation and Recent Sedimentation	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												This paper presents the results of geomorphological, geochronological and lithological investigation of a young sedimentation basin - the periglacial Lake Bretjorna (Ledovoe). Formation of the lake began at the end of the first half of the 20th century in the west of Nordenskiold Land (Western Svalbard) within the mar-ginal zone of the Gronfjord glacier, after significant degradation of this glacial massif. The present-day look of the lake was formed at the end of the 20th century however its geomorphological development went on until the beginning of the 21st. The filling of the sedimentation basin with limnoglacial sediments began approxi-mately from the 1930s and proceeded with spatial and temporal irregularity. Bottom sediments of the lake presented mainly by silty-pelitic material, but in places with an admixture of gravel and pebbles, were formed as the front of the Grenfjord glacier retreated in the direction from north-east to south-west. At the first stage, sediment-genesis was mainly accomplished by the intra-and subglacial sediments, which entered the lake as a result of thermal erosion at the contact of the lake and ice since the late 1940s until the end of the last cen-tury, as the present-day lake basin became ice-free. Sediments formed at this stage are composed by coarser and poorly sorted material, which is typical for glacial deposits. At the second stage, the sediments became less coarse and more sorted. After the loss of contact between the lake and the glacier, the role of intra-and subglacial sediments decreased. At this time, sedimentation in the lake goes on by the runoff of melted glacial waters and atmospheric precipitation falling on the catchment area of the lake. The value of the average sed-imentation rate in the lake was determined by means of radioisotope dating according to 210Pb and 137Cs and amounted 5.4 mm/year in the north, 12.4 mm/year in the central part, and 16.4 mm/year in the south of the lake, which is comparable with the data obtained by gravity method using sedimentological traps (12-15 mm/year).

Integrating distance sampling survey data with population indices to separate trends in abundance and temporary immigration	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Managers rely on accurate estimators of wildlife abundance and trends for management decisions. Despite the focus of contemporary wildlife science on developing methods to improve inference from wildlife surveys, legacy datasets often rely on index counts that lack information about the detection process. Data integration can be a useful tool for combining index counts with data collected under more rigorous designs (i.e., designs that account for the detection process), but care is required when datasets represent different population processes or are mismatched in space and time. This can be particularly problematic in cases where animals aggregate in response to a spatially or temporally limited resource because individuals may temporarily immigrate from outside the study area and be included in the abundance index. Abundance indices based on brown bear (Ursus arctos) feeding aggregations within coastal meadows in early summer in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA, are one such example. These indices reflect the target population (brown bears residing within the park) and temporary immigrants (i.e., bears drawn from outside the park boundary). To properly account for the effects of temporary immigration, we integrated the index data with abundance data collected via park-wide distance sampling surveys, the latter of which properly addressed the detection process. By assuming that the distance data provide inference on abundance and the index counts represent some combination of abundance and temporary immigration processes, we were able to decompose the relative contribution of each to overall trend. We estimated that the density of brown bears within our study area was 38-54 adults/1,000 km(2) during 2003-2019 and that abundance increased at a rate of approximately 1.4%/year. The contribution of temporary immigrants to overall trend in the index was low, so we created 3 hypothetical scenarios to more fully demonstrate how the integrated approach could be useful in situations where the composite trend in meadow counts may obscure trends in abundance (e.g., opposing trends in abundance and temporary immigration). Our work represents a conceptual advance supporting the integration of legacy index data with more rigorous data streams and is broadly applicable in cases where trends in index values may represent a mixture of population processes.

J	Sousounis, PJ				Sousounis, PJ			Lake-aggregate mesoscale disturbances .3. Description of a mesoscale aggregate vortex	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The structure of a meso-alpha-scale vortex that developed over the Great Lakes in late autumn is described. Understanding the structure of this particular vortex is important because 1) it altered local- and regional-scale precipitation, 2) it developed in a complicated fashion, and 3) it represents a class of vortices that develop frequently during cold-air outbreaks over the Great Lakes and whose development is not yet understood. Detailed perturbation analyses of the synoptic-scale and mesoscale conditions over the Great Lakes chat led to the vortex development are presented using model output from previous numerical simulations that included all of the Great Lakes (WL) and none of the Great Lakes (NL). The initial thermal perturbation was characterized by an elongated warm plume near the surface that advanced southeastward toward the mid-Atlantic coast as cold air overspread the entire lakes region. The plume then became more circular and deepened as it rotated toward the northeast in response to the changing synoptic-scale flow. The perturbation winds revealed several small meso-beta-scale circulations that developed during the first 36 h within the warm plume. By 48 h, a 3-km-deep meso-alpha-scale vortex developed Several hundred kilometers to the northeast of Lake Huron with cyclonic how in the lower half and anticyclonic how in the upper half. Its size, location, and evolution indicate that it was likely generated by aggregate-lake as opposed to individual-lake heating and moistening. It is therefore referred to as a mesoscale aggregate vortex (MAV). The MAV that developed represents a class of vortices that can be described as inertially stable, meso-alpha-scale warm-core vortices approximately 500-1000 km wide and 2-4-km deep that develop from aggregate heating and moistening over the Great Lakes. They are usually identifiable on standard surface weather charts as a weak low over the Great Lakes region with 1-3 closed isobars at 2-mb intervals. The outermost closed isobar typically encloses an area approximately as large as that spanned by the upper Great Lakes (e.g., Lakes Superior, Huron, and Michigan). Because the MAV in this study developed nearly 36 h after the coldest air left the region, it is not clear whether other physical mechanisms besides sensible and latent heating were involved, to what extent they were important, and at what stages they occurred. Additionally, the MAV developed within a large elliptical region of lake-aggregate heated air, which suggests the importance of geostrophic adjustment, and from smaller individual-lake scale circulations, which suggests the importance of vortex merger. Development mechanisms will be discussed in a follow-up study.																			0027-0644					JUN	1997	125	6					1111	1134		10.1175/1520-0493(1997)125<1111:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1997)125<1111:LAMDPI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1997XD65100006

Prior to listing, a captive broodstock program was initiated to prevent species extinction and to begin rebuilding the population. Reintroduction plans for captive broodstock progeny have followed a "spread-the-risk" philosophy incorporating multiple release strategies and lakes. Since 1993, more than 860,000 presmolts, 158,000 smolts, 325,000 eyed eggs and 880 adults have been reintroduced to the habitat. From this production, 312 anadromous sockeye salmon have returned to adult trapping facilities in the Sawtooth Valley of Idaho. Monitoring and evaluation efforts have focused on maximizing the use of limited hatchery-rearing space and on identifying and prioritizing the most successful reintroduction strategies. Comparisons of presmolt overwinter survival and out-migration success from nursery lakes have shown that (1) presmolts released directly to Redfish Lake in October have emigrated more successfully than presmolts reared in Redfish Lake net pens prior to release, (2) presmolts released directly to Alturas and Pettit lakes in October have emigrated more successfully than presmolts released directly to takes in July, and (3) presmolts reared at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) Sawtooth Fish Hatchery emigrated more successfully than presmolts reared at the IDFG Eagle Fish Hatchery following July releases to Alturas and Pettit lakes. Presmolts that spent one winter in Redfish Lake prior to out-migration were interrogated more successfully at lower Snake and Columbia River dams than smolts released in the outlet of Redfish Lake. Smolt-to-adult return rates for anadromous adults produced by the captive broodstock program from 2000 to 2002 varied from 0.6% for unmarked fish returning in 2002 to 0.4% for a combined smolt and presmolt release group in 2000. Using captive broodstock techniques, the program has successfully prevented the extinction of Snake River sockeye salmon and increased Population abundance in the habitat. However, without Substantive improvements in smolt-to-adult survival, program efforts will likely be insufficient to rebuild the population to self-sustaining levels.																			0892-2284		1-888569-69-7				2004	44						401	413																WOS:000228130200034

Late Pleistocene-Holocene environmental fluctuations of southern Chihuahua Desert, Mexico	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the Mexican Chihuahua Desert based on biological proxies are scarce, creating a gap in our understanding of the ecological responses to climate change in this water-scarce region. Here, we present a paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on geochemical data and biological proxies such as ostracods and ephippia from cladocerans from the Santa Clara basin, at the southern Chihuahua Desert, during the last 18.7 cal ka. Overall, cold and humid conditions between 18.7 and 15 cal ka BP prevailed in the Santa Clara region without ostracod preservation. During the warmer B & oslash;lling-Aller & oslash;d, L. axalapasco presented higher productivity; however, this species did not occur during the colder Younger Dryas. The early Holocene was marked by a general trend towards warmer and dryer conditions, and a sedimentary hiatus was detected from 10.7 to 6.4 cal ka BP. Subsequently, when the North American Monsoon reached its maximum extension, ostracods exhibit their maximum total abundance during 6-4.8 cal ka BP, indicating warmer and shallower lake conditions. The presence of only females of L. bradburyi between 4-2 cal ka BP possibly suggests lower lake water temperatures associated with enhanced winter precipitation under El Ni & ntilde;o type conditions. Finally, during the last 2 cal ka ephippia, L. axalapasco females and geochemical data suggest the driest period of the record as the ITCZ continued moving southwards. This work reveals the marked sensitivity of southern Chihuahua Desert ecosystems to the climatic shifts that occurred since the Last Glacial Maximum, and this perhaps indicates their vulnerability to future global warming reducing monsoonal precipitation.

The results show a fan delta with well-connected conglomerate bodies deposited during a highstand system tract (HST) and a nearshore subaqueous fan with weakly connected conglomerate bodies deposited in a transgressive system tract (TST). The conglomerates are mainly classified as feldspathic litharenite. The porosity and permeability of the fan delta vary from 0.1% to 17.4% and 0.01 to 457.6 mD, respectively. The porosity and permeability vary from 2.02 to 16.2% and 0.02 to 237.2 mD in the nearshore subaqueous fan. Mechanical compaction, dissolution, and cementation together are noteworthy diagenetic processes. Compaction is the dominant factor in reducing porosity; cementation has a destructive effect, while dissolution improves reservoir quality. Feldspar dissolution leads to kaolinite, illite, dickite precipitation, and deteriorating reservoir quality. The probable sources of meteoric water flux in the deep-burial environments are related to the falling lake level during the HST. Fluid inclusion analysis revealed that quartz overgrowths were formed during the mesodiagenetic stage. The depositional environment and grain sizes are essential factors controlling reservoir quality. The effect of grain size and sorting coefficients on reservoir quality varies as a function of retrogradation and progradation sequences. The higher the porosity and permeability, the coarser the particle sizes in the retrogradation sequences. In the progradation sequences, poorly sorted sediments have higher porosity and permeability than well-sorted sediments. The braided channel embodies the best reservoir quality in the TST, while the distributary channel represents the best reservoir in the HST. The formation mechanism of the high-quality reservoirs is ascribed to the sedimentary facies, compaction resistance, and mineral dissolution. Overall, the conglomerate reservoirs developed in the HST are relatively better than those in the TST because they have greater labile fragments, resulting in more dissolution. This study demonstrated that for successful assessment of conglomerate reservoirs in the Lijin area and similar reservoirs elsewhere, reservoirs characterization must link sequence stratigraphy, facies, and diagenesis to understand the high-quality reservoir distribution to support the predrill evaluation of reservoirs.					; Qiu, Longwei/AAJ-8055-2021; KRA, Kouassi/GSD-5724-2022	Camara, Moussa/0000-0001-7952-5499; Ahmed, Kabir Shola/0000-0002-6235-1776; Kra, Kouassi Louis/0000-0002-6903-5952; 													0920-4105	1873-4715				NOV	2022	218								110913	10.1016/j.petrol.2022.110913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2022.110913		AUG 2022											WOS:000844854900001

Diverse, discrete, mantle-derived batches of basalt erupted along a short normal fault zone: The Poison Lake chain, southernmost Cascades	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Poison Lake chain consists of small, monogenetic, calc-alkaline basaltic volcanoes located east of the Cascade arc axis, 30 km ENE of Lassen Peak in northeastern California. This chain consists of 39 distinguishable units in a 14-km-long and 2-km-wide zone trending NNW, parallel to nearby Quaternary normal faults. The 39 units fall into nine coherent groups based on stratigraphy, field characteristics, petrography, and major-element compositions. Petrographic differences among groups are expressed by different amounts and proportions of phenocrysts. MgO-SiO(2), K(2)O-SiO(2), and TiO(2)-SiO(2) variation diagrams illustrate clear differences in compatible and incompatible elements among the groups. Variation of K(2)O/TiO(2) and K(2)O/P(2)O(5) with MgO indicates that most of the basalts of the Poison Lake chain cannot be related by crystal fractionation at different pressures and that compositions have not been affected significantly by incorporation of low-degree silicic crustal melt or interaction with sialic crust. Limited trace-element and whole-rock isotopic data also suggest little if any incorporation of upper-crustal material, and that compositional variation among groups primarily reflects source compositional differences. Precise (40)Ar/(39)Ar determinations show that the lavas were erupted between 100 and 110 ka. The migration of paleomagnetic remanent directions over 30 degrees suggests that the entire Poison Lake chain could represent three short-lived episodes of volcanism within a period as brief as 500 yr. The diverse geologic, petrographic, chemical, paleomagnetic, and age data indicate that each of the nine groups represents a small, discrete magma batch generated in the mantle and stored briefly in the lower crust. A NNW normal fault zone provided episodic conduits that allowed rapid ascent of these batches to the surface, where they erupted as distinct volcanic groups, each aligned along a segment of the Poison Lake chain. Compositional diversity of these primitive magmas argues against widespread, long-lived ponding of uniform basalt magma at the base of the crust in this region and against interaction with a zone of melting, assimilation, storage, and homogenization (MASH) in the lower crust.																			0016-7606					NOV-DEC	2011	123	11-12					2177	2200		10.1130/B30370.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B30370.1													WOS:000295402600004

In East Africa, 68.7% of water at very high risk comes from such sources. Using unimproved drinking water sources can lead to serious health risks, including waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and hepatitis. Therefore, this study aimed to map the spatial distribution of unimproved drinking water sources in the region. Methods We analyzed recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 12 East African countries (Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). A total of 206,748 households were sampled in 12 East African countries. Data management and analysis were carried out in several stages, beginning with data cleaning, followed by statistical weighting and data merging. This was then followed by geospatial analysis and mapping, and finally, spatial cluster detection. Results Spatial clusters of unimproved drinking water sources were identified within the study area (Global Moran's I: 0.018, z-score: 87.10, p < 0.05). A total of 167 significant spatial windows containing primary and secondary clusters were identified. The first spatial window contained the primary clusters, while the remaining 166 spatial windows contained secondary clusters. Primary clusters were found in Madagascar and coastal Mozambique, with secondary clusters distributed across all 12 countries analyzed. Conclusions This study identified significant clusters, hotspots, and outliers (high-high clusters) of unimproved drinking water sources across various East African countries. To address these issues effectively, priority should be given to the identified clusters, hotspots, and high-high clusters. Primary recommendations include expanding water treatment facilities, improving water distribution systems, and protecting drinking water sources. Secondary recommendations emphasize strengthening regulations, conducting research, and fostering public-private partnerships to ensure sustainable access to clean water. Finally, we urge collaboration among governments, international organizations, and NGOs to enhance water infrastructure. Their efforts should focus on providing technical assistance, financial support, capacity building, project implementation, advocacy, and financing for drinking water infrastructure in the region. Further research integrating health outcome data with spatial analysis could help identify high-risk regions where the impacts of unimproved water sources are most pronounced.

High mountain lakes are naturally fishless although invasive trout and most recently minnows have been introduced causing a major impact on fauna richness. The Pyrenean high mountain range has preserved soft-water oligotrophic boreal isoetids in their southern limit of distribution but the recent fish introduction is a potential factor of stress that needs to be addressed. We here work under the hypothesis that due to contrasting ecological features, trout will not be heavily affecting quillwort populations while minnows will have a stronger effect on zooplankton and zoobenthos that will promote algal growth and reduce light availability for the underwater meadows. Ten Pyrenean shallow lakes representative of three scenarios -fishless, with trout and with minnows-, were sampled for meadow structure, water column and benthic environment characterization in mid-summer 2015 and 2016. Quillwort biomass allocation (above vs. belowground), epiphytic load, and composition of the algal community (abundant cyanobacteria) differed in the presence of minnows. In trout lakes biomass allocation and epiphytic load were average and the algal community composed by chlorophytes and diatoms as in fishless lakes. Biomass ratio was close to thresholds of negative buoyancy in minnow lakes indicating that meadows were at risk of uprooting and consequent de-vegetation. Total and soluble carbohydrates were lower and the sporangia contained significantly less reserves to constrain growth and expansion in the presence of minnows. Lake scenarios were coupled to physicochemical differences with low light, high phosphorus and Chl-a (mesotrophia) in minnow lakes, while trout and fishless lakes remained oligotrophic. This is the first study assessing the impact of non-native fish on soft-water isoetids from mountain lakes and shows that minnows are a major threat to quillworts. The impaired light environment (from epiphytic algal overgrow and water column Chl-a) entails consequent regression (i.e., no recruitment) and de-vegetation (uprooting) of themeadows. Since soft-water oligotrophic mountain lakes are protected under the Habitats Directive, some action needs to be urgently implemented not only to preserve quillworts but to the overall ecological integrity of the lakes.

Evaluation of biomonitoring approach to study lake contamination by accumulation of trace elements in selected aquatic macrophytes: A case study of Kanewal Community Reserve, Gujarat, India	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												A biomonitoring study was carried out at Kanewal reservoir, an internationally important wetland listed in Asian Directory of Wetlands, designated as a "Wetland of National Importance" and a proposed community reserve of Gujarat State, India, to ascertain the degree of trace element contamination. The study focused on assessment of trace element contamination in certain aquatic macrophytes to be used as biomonitors, in comparison with water and sediments (abiotic monitor) for heavy metal pollution. Good information was provided by analyzing the roots, stems and leaves of native aquatic plants (biomonitors) represented by seven species: Eichhornia crassipes, Echinochloa colonum, Hydrilla verticillata, Ipomoea aquatica, Nelumbo nucifera, Typha angustata and Vallisneria spiralis, along with surface sediments and water, were analyzed for Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn contamination. The highest concentrations of the trace elements were measured in Eichhornia crassipes and the lowest in Nelumbo nucifera. Based on the concentration and toxicity status observed in the lake's vegetation, the six metals are arranged in the following decreasing order: Zn > Cu > Ni > Cd > Co > Pb. Compared with the standard, normal and critical toxicity range in plants, the detected value of Pb falls within normal range, while that of other elements were within the critical range. However, Zn and Cu showed the highest concentration and alarming toxicity levels, which are considered as one of the most hazardous pollutants in Kanewal reservoir. Certain species of aquatic macrophytes are also proposed as biomonitors (and/or biofilters) such as Eichhornia crassipes and Typha angustata, which are the two most useful species in biomonitoring studies due to their ability to accumulate elements in high concentration in the roots and its availability throughout the year. The results showed the significant difference in accumulation of metals like Zn, Cu and Ni in different plant organs, which showed more accumulation in roots than that of stems and leaves. High positive correlation between combinations of different metal pairs in plant's root, stem or leaf system was established.

J	Zhou, SC; Cai, QH; Xu, YY; Han, XQ				Zhou, Shuchan; Cai, Qinghua; Xu, Yaoyang; Han, Xinqin			Daily and vertical dynamics of rotifers under the impact of diatom blooms in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Three Gorges Dam was built in 2005 with a storage capacity of 39.3 billion m(3), ranking 22nd in the world. However, since the impoundment of the reservoir, serious blooms of phytoplankton have occurred. Rotifers, having a key role in the freshwater aquatic food web, are important grazers of phytoplankton and an essential food resource to higher trophic consumers. To explore the impacts of phytoplankton blooms on the rotifer community, daily and vertical surveys of rotifers were conducted in a bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir (Xiangxi Bay). Altogether 46 rotifer species were registered, and Synchaeta tremula, Polyarthra vulgaris, and Brachionus calyciflorus were the most abundant species accounting for 36, 26, and 16% of the mean rotifer densities, respectively. Although these dominant species always prevailed in the rotifer community, their proportions changed significantly from non-bloom phase to bloom phase, e.g., the significance of S. tremula deceased from 46.8 to 33.2%, while P. vulgaris and B. calyciflorus increased from 23.9 and 13.9% to 26.2 and 16.2%, respectively. In the vertical water column, all the rotifer following phytoplankton displayed an aggregated distribution, concentrating at the upper layers (0.5-5 m), especially during the bloom phase. From the non-bloom phase to the bloom phase, rotifer densities, the dominant rotifers, Shannon-Wiener and Margalef's diversity increased significantly, while the evenness displayed the opposite trend. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) revealed that the samples in the non-bloom phase were well separated from those in the bloom phase. This means that the outbreak of the diatom bloom in the Xiangxi Bay had significant impacts on the rotifer community. Further investigations are needed to address the impacts of the changes of rotifer community on higher trophic levels.					; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012	Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2011	675	1					29	40		10.1007/s10750-011-0793-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0793-2													WOS:000293643700004

Lake-effect snow as the dominant control of mesic-forest distribution in Michigan, USA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Recent studies demonstrated the sensitivity of northern forest ecosystems to changes in the amount and duration of snow cover at annual to decadal time scales. However, the consequences of snowfall variability remain uncertain for ecological variables operating at longer time scales, especially the distributions of forest communities. 2 The Great Lakes region of North America offers a unique setting to examine the long-term effects of variable snowfall on forest communities. Lake-effect snow produces a three-fold gradient in annual snowfall over tens of kilometres, and dramatic edaphic variations occur among landform types resulting from Quaternary glaciations. We tested the hypothesis that these factors interact to control the distributions of mesic (dominated by Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia) and xeric forests (dominated by Pinus and Quercus spp.) in northern Lower Michigan. 3 We compiled pre-European-settlement vegetation data and overlaid these data with records of climate, water balance and soil, onto Landtype Association polygons in a geographical information system. We then used multivariate adaptive regression splines to model the abundance of mesic vegetation in relation to environmental controls. 4 Snowfall is the most predictive among five variables retained by our model, and it affects model performance 29% more than soil texture, the second most important variable. The abundance of mesic trees is high on fine-textured soils regardless of snowfall, but it increases with snowfall on coarse-textured substrates. Lake-effect snowfall also determines the species composition within mesic forests. The weighted importance of A. saccharum is significantly greater than of T. canadensis or F. grandifolia within the lake-effect snowbelt, whereas T. canadensis is more plentiful outside the snowbelt. These patterns are probably driven by the influence of snowfall on soil moisture, nutrient availability and fire return intervals. 5 Our results imply that a key factor dictating the spatio-temporal patterns of forest communities in the vast region around the Great Lakes is how the lake-effect snowfall regime responds to global change. Snowfall reductions will probably cause a major decrease in the abundance of ecologically and economically important species, such as A. saccharum.

J	Jankovská, V; Kociánová, M; Dudová, L				Jankovska, Vlasta; Kocianova, Milena; Dudova, Lydie			Late Holocene palsa formation in northern Fennoscandia: Fossil pollen indication and climatic trigger	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Palsa is a peat mound with a permanently frozen core, occurring in the (sub)polar zone. So far, the history of European palsa mires has been investigated mainly by means of analysis of plant macroremains. To better understand how the formation of palsa is reflected in pollen records, we investigated fossil pollen of two sites in northern Fennoscandia: a conical palsa close to Abisko National Park (NW Sweden) and low palsa mire close to Nikel, Kola Peninsula (NW Russia). At both sites, the formation of palsa is demonstrated by the same pattern in pollen record: decrease of Cyperaceae pollen and Pteridophyta and Lycopodiophyta spores, and the associated increase of ericoid dwarf shrubs and Rubus chamaemorus pollen. This pattern represents the change from a wet fen to a dry bog plant community after the uplift of the palsa mound above the surrounding terrain. The age of both palsas formation around 2370 cal BP (Abisko) and 2270 cal BP (Nikel) falls in the two main periods of palsa initiation in Europe and thus represents further evidence of significant cooling in the period 2600-2100 cal BP. At both investigated sites, this cooling is also reflected by the decline of pine and the expansion of birch tundra. Besides new original data, we provide an overview of so-far dated palsa formation in northern Fennoscandia and an interpretative key for identifying palsa in the palaeoecological record, based on plant species typical of the different stages of palsa development.

J	Zhambalova, SG				Zhambalova, S. G.			Traditional Buryat Burials: Changes and Stereotypes	ARCHAEOLOGY ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF EURASIA												Buryat burials are described with regard to the age and social status of the deceased. Changes and conservative features are evaluated, and cultural stereotypes are discussed. Certain novel traits are due to a recombination of traditional elements; others are caused by external stimuli. Environmental adaptations and the role of cultural factors are assessed. There are two traditional types of low-ranking burials: above-ground under cover with accompanying goods; and cremation. Both were practiced throughout the Buryat ethnic area. Its inclusion in the Russian Empire and the spread of Buddhism resulted in the emergence in the Baikal region of two major religious groups-shamanists in the cis-Baikal area and Buddhists living east of Lake Baikal. Changes affected burial practices as well. Under the impact of the Russian tradition, inhumation burials in coffins emerged. Under Buddhism, only members of clergy but not lay persons were cremated. Cremation became the principal rite west of Lake Baikal, while having disappeared east of it. Two types of the above-ground burials became common-shamanist and Buddhist. From that time on, ground burials can be divided into two subtypes-shamanist and Buddhist, the latter being predominant in the Trans-Baikal region. Burials of children fall in several categories-suspended, cremation, both types of above-ground, and inhumation. Burials and commemoration practices relating to shamans and the Buddhist clergy are described. One evolutionary line demonstrates changes in burial practices concerning ordinary people and contributing to the integration of the traditional culture into the outside world, another line highlights the sacral stereotypes, preserving the core of the traditional culture. Both opposing lines maintain the integrity of the Buryat ethnic tradition in both space and time.

J	Novak, BA				Novak, Boris A.			The Authority of the Author: A Cult of the Past or of the Future?	PRIMERJALNA KNJIZEVNOST												This paper analyses the history of the category originality, which is a conditio sine qua non of any authorship. It lakes as a starting point Lotman's models of "aesthetics of identity", characteristic for the Middle Ages, and "aesthetics of difference", which prevailed in the last centuries. It owes a lot also to Mortier's thesis that oraginality became an artistic criterium already in the period of the Enlightenment,and not only later in those of Romanticism and Modernism, as we usually think.. Me changing of the concept of the authorship over the centuries had its consequences also, for the changing of the status of translation: in the Middle Ages a translation was always an adaptation as well; the rise of the Author to the throne of the absolute Creator of the artistic world caused the fall of the status of translators, since their activity was seen as secondary. This hierarchic relation lasted until recently, when Postmodernism in literature (Borges) and phenomenology and reception theory (Rezeptionsasthetik) rehabilitated translators in the field of literary) criticism. The thesis about the death of the Author could be traced implicitly already, in Mallarme's poetics; explicitly it was developed by Valery. The writer of this article, a poet himself, is convinced that the Postmodern limitation of the arrogance of the Author was necessary; bill that repealing Barthes' slogan about the death of the Author is no longer productive: we live in a period when the global economy is based on copyrights, which Capital is trying to steal from their original creators and owners - authors who are alive and kicking.																			0351-1189						2009	32						187	198																WOS:000270459700005
J	JACKSON, JN				JACKSON, JN			THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE 1ST, 2ND, AND 3RD WELLAND CANALS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The Welland canals are features of great Canadian renown in terms of engineering, as transportation arteries, and through their contributions to industrial development and urban achievement. Their instigator was William Hamilton Merritt, a St. Catharines businessman. Functionally, they must be perceived as an inland extension of the St. Lawrence system of water-ways. These contributions began when the First Welland Canal opened in 1829, and extend continuously up to the present. The First Welland Canal, fed from the Grand River, was constructed through the canalization of rivers north of the Niagara Escarpment, by locks across this relief barrier, and a man-made cut to the south. The canal then took advantage of the Welland and Niagara rivers to reach Lake Erie. Hardly a feature of this achievement was as anticipated and, in 1833, the route was changed by a cut direct to Lake Erie at Port Colborne. The Second Canal, opened in 1845, followed essentially the same route, but with stone locks and a new channel constructed slightly to the west of its predecessor. The Third Canal was wider and deeper. It offered fewer locks and, though retaining Port Dalhousie as its northern outlet on Lake Ontario, its alignment was now a cut east of St. Catharines and Thorold across the Ontario Plain. The Second Canal remained in use at the two ends for the smaller-sized vessels to serve St. Catharines and Thorold, and its water supply continued to power industry until hydroelectricity was obtained from the power projects on the Niagara River at Niagara Falls.																			0315-1468					JUN	1991	18	3					472	483		10.1139/l91-058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/l91-058													WOS:A1991FX18600013

Since 1993 the lake has been artificially mixed in summer by a bubble plume installation. The result is quite successful since the mass of Microcystis is up to 20 times lower than in the years before mixing and no scum is present any more. The study in Lake Nieuwe Meer showed a shift from cyanobacterial dominance (mainly Microcystis) to flagellates, green-algae and diatoms when artificial mixing was applied. Total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations did not change as a result of mixing and had apparently no effect on the shift in the phytoplankton composition. The chlorophylla concentration was much lower in the mixed lake as a result of dilution. The total algae biomass decreased. The transparency did not improve. The total heat energy of the lake is slightly higher than before mixing but still remains in the range of annual fluctuation. The temperature on the surface is approximately 2degreesC lower. In the whole water-body oxygen was always higher than 5 mg/l. Living space for fish is therefore wider. The installation in Lake Nieuwe Meer consists of flexible pipes near the sediment, built in a way to prevent sediment erosion and transport into the water. There are no constructions in the water-body. All mechanical parts are on land. The layout of the installation is shown in Fig. 1. Installed compressor energy is 85 kW. This is equivalent to an upper middle-class motor-car. The design was made specifically for this problem. It is based on the physical data of the algae and the plant. It would be beneficial to use this 7 years' experience for further applications e.g. elimination of toxic algae in drinking-water reservoirs.					; Visser, Petra/NJT-4667-2025	Visser, Petra/0000-0003-3294-1908; 													1606-9749		1-900222-58-2				2001	1	1					17	23		10.2166/ws.2001.0003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2001.0003													WOS:000175400400003

Radio- and stable carbon isotope analysis reveals minimal assimilation of petrogenic carbon into an oligotrophic freshwater food web after experimental spills of diluted bitumen	CHEMOSPHERE												Following an oil spill into water, bacteria can biodegrade petroleum hydrocarbons which could lead to petrogenic carbon assimilation by aquatic biota. We used changes in the isotope ratios of radio- (?C-14) and stable (d(13)C) carbon to examine the potential for assimilation of petrogenic carbon into a freshwater food web following experimental spills of diluted bitumen (dilbit) into a boreal lake in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Different volumes (1.5, 2.9, 5.5, 18, 42, 82, and 180 L) of Cold Lake Winter Blend (a heavy crude blend of bitumen and condensate) dilbit were applied to seven 10-m diameter littoral limnocorrals (approximate volume of 100 m(3)), and two additional limnocorrals had no added dilbit to serve as controls. Particulate organic matter (POM) and periphyton from oil-treated limnocorrals had lower d(13)C (up to 3.2%o and 2.1%o for POM and periphyton, respectively) than the control at every sampled interval (3, 6 and 10 weeks for POM and 6, 8 and 10 weeks for periphyton). Dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) had lower ?C-14 in the oil -treated limnocorrals relative to the control (up to 122%o and 440%o lower, respectively). Giant floater mussel (Pyganodon grandis) housed for 25 days in aquaria containing oil-contaminated water from the limnocorrals did not show significant changes in d(13)C values of muscle tissue compared to mussels housed in control water. Overall, the changes in d(13)C and ?C-14 observed indicated small amounts (up to 11% in DIC) of oil carbon incorporation into the food web. The combined d(13)C and ?C-14 data provide evidence for minimal incorporation of dilbit into the food web of this oligotrophic lake, suggesting that microbial degradation and subsequent incorporation of oil C into the food web may play a relatively small role in the ultimate fate of oil in this type of ecosystem.					; Palace, Vince/AHB-6708-2022; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020; Hanson, Mark/C-4620-2008; Layton-Matthews, Daniel/GQI-4712-2022; Graves, Stephanie/HNP-1726-2023; Rodriguez Gil, Jose Luis/B-3479-2010; Orihel, Diane/G-5462-2011; Leybourne, Matthew/AAA-9340-2019	Leybourne, Matthew/0000-0002-2361-6014; Graves, Stephanie/0000-0003-4535-9941; Hanson, Mark/0000-0002-8725-004X													0045-6535	1879-1298				JUL	2023	329								138608	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138608		APR 2023						37028727					WOS:000983060800001
J	Göktas, F				Goktas, Fikret			Neogene Geology of the Mentes Peninsula, Western Anatolia	TURKIYE JEOLOJI BULTENI-GEOLOGICAL BULLETIN OF TURKEY												The terrestrial Neogene sequence of the Mente$ Peninsula, located in the Urla section of the Fo & ccedil;a Depression, comprises the Middle Miocene Urla Group. The Urla Group unconformably overlies the late Early Miocene Kocada & gbreve; Volcanics and consists of sedimentary and volcanic rock units. A sedimentary succession, consisting predominantly of lacustrine deposits, begins with the Bozavlu Formation reflecting alluvial fan sedimentation, continues with the volcano-sedimentary G & uuml;vendik Formation deposited on the lacustrine shoreface, and ends with the Urla Limestone. The G & uuml;vendik succession frequently contains volcanoclastic density current levels in epiclastic (lahar and turbiditic sandstone) and pyroclastic (ignimbrite, base surge, blocky ash flow) facies, reflecting the early period of Mente$ volcanism. The Urla Limestone conformably overlies the G & uuml;vendik Formation. The Urla Limestone succession contains tuff interlayers with ash fall facies of the Mente$ volcanism from bottom to top. Algal bioclastites and oncoidal limestones were deposited at the base and transgressive parts of the limestone succession, formed by waves in the foreshore belt. The Middle Miocene alkali volcanism of the Mente$ Peninsula is represented by the Mente$ Volcanics and the Ovac & imath;k Basalt. Mente$ volcanism, which yields products in the trachyterhyolite composition range, consists of pyroclastics, composite lava domes and dome-flows. The pyroclastic sequence starts with unwelded ignimbrites containing accidental lithics derived from the Ovac & imath;k Basalt, and continues with successive levels of blocky ash flow and base surge. Mente & scedil; volcanism evolved in the lake where the G & uuml;vendik and Urla Limestone units were deposited. Basic volcanism, which developed laterally to the Mente & scedil; acidic volcanism, continued to be active intermittently from the beginning of Urla Limestone deposition to the last stages.																			1016-9164					APR	2024	67	2					169	194		10.25288/tjb.1380696	http://dx.doi.org/10.25288/tjb.1380696													WOS:001273781100002
J	Morton, B; Puljas, S				Morton, Brian; Puljas, Sanja			Life-history strategy, with ctenidial and pallial larval brooding, of the troglodytic 'living fossil' Congeria kusceri (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) from the subterranean Dinaric Alpine karst of Croatia	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Among freshwater bivalves, the brooding of embryos and larvae within the maternal ctenidia is well known. Exceptions to this generalization are the non-brooding freshwater and estuarine species of Dreissena and Mytilopsis, respectively. It was reported that the freshwater troglodytic cousin, Congeria kusceri Bole, 1962, of these dreissenids does not brood either. It is herein demonstrated that C.?kusceri undergoes one reproductive cycle each year. Sexes are separate, with an early male and later female bias. A small percentage (2.14%) of individuals is hermaphroditic. The gonads mature over summer from May to November. Spawning commences in September, when females release mature oocytes into their ctenidia and inhale sperm from mature males. Here the oocytes are fertilized, and develop within interfilamentary marsupia. Ctenidial tissues glandularize, and may provide a source of maternal nutrition for the embryos. At the late prodissoconch-1 or prodissoconch-2 stage (PR2, similar to 220?mu m), larvae are released into the infrabranchial chamber via a birth channel along the outer edge of the ventral marginal food groove of both inner demibranchs. Here, they are brooded further in mantle pouches located beneath the inhalant siphon. Subsequently, after the PR2 stage (nepioconch/dissoconch), they are released from the inhalant siphon and assume an independent life as crawling juveniles. Such juveniles may be found amongst clusters of adults. Not only is C.?kusceri unique amongst the Dreissenidae in possessing the capacity to brood internally fertilized ova, but it is also exceptional amongst the Bivalvia in possessing the described methods of brooding and birth. Explanations for both lie in its troglodytic lifestyle, decadal length longevity and habitat: that of byssal attachment to the hard surfaces of underground freshwater rivers, caves, pits, and sinkholes in the Tethyan arc of the Dinaric karst. Internal fertilization of a few large yolky eggs, lecithotrophic larvae, ctenidial brooding, and secondary pallial parental care represent relatively recent, Late Miocene, evolutionary adaptations from a Tethyan lentic ancestor.					; Puljas, Sanja/P-5378-2015	Puljas, Sanja/0000-0003-1435-5446; 													0024-4066					FEB	2013	108	2					294	314		10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02020.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.02020.x													WOS:000313784500005
J	Rimmer, A; Boger, M; Aota, Y; Kumagai, M				Rimmer, A; Boger, M; Aota, Y; Kumagai, M			A lake as a natural integrator of linear processes: Application to Lake Kinneret (Israel) and Lake Biwa (Japan)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The major hydrological variables that may cause long-term salinity changes in fresh water takes are the volume of the lake, stream and/or groundwater inflows and outflows, direct rainfall, stream, groundwater, and rainfall salinity and evaporation. Measurements of these variables are usually subject to natural fluctuations and unavoidable errors of the measured data. Therefore, evaluation of the contribution of each component to the long-term salinity trends is difficult. In this work, it is shown that since salinization processes are linear, lakes are able to retain a 'solute influx memory', which records information about their lake-watershed-climate relationship in the past. Our objective was to test and verify a system approach method, which evaluates this 'memory', i.e. investigates the causes of long-term salinization processes in fresh water lakes. With this approach, a general expression is developed that represents the lake as a natural integrator of linear processes in space and time. The long-term change of the chloride concentration in the lake (representing salinity) reflects the long-term changes in each of the various past hydrological variables. The general theory of the lake as a natural integrator was tested by examination of the long-term salinity changes in Lake Kinneret, Israel. and Lake Biwa, Japan. The hydrology and salinity of both lakes are well monitored for several decades. In the analysis of Lake Kinneret, the long-term measurements of inflows, outflows and lake salinity were used to verify that the salinization mechanism follows the theory of complete mixing (system identification). In Lake Biwa the same approach was used, however, we assumed that the salinization mechanism was 'complete mixing', and the long-term measurements of the lake hydrology were used to investigate the reasons for increasing salinity (system detection). Since the system analysis is affected by uncertainties of the measured variables, a stochastic component was added, in order to take these uncertainties into account.

J	Dembowska, E; Kaminski, D; Wojciechowska, A				Dembowska, Ewa; Kaminski, Dariusz; Wojciechowska, Anna			Phytoplankton response to the massive expansion of Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) H.St.John, 1920 in a floodplain lake of the Vistula River (Poland)	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The spread of invasive non-native species, one of the greatest threats to biodiversity and the economy, affects the structure and functions of ecosystems at all levels. At the beginning of the 21st century a rapid expansion of the submerged macrophyte Elodea nuttallii was observed in southern and eastern Europe. However. this plant, native to North America, was already recorded in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Our study aimed to evaluate changes in phytoplankton communities caused by the presence of this new invader. The research was conducted in a large floodplain lake in the Vistula valley (north-central Poland) and involved regular monitoring of the lake's ecological status using phytoplankton-based methods. Long-term observations enabled us to track the impact of this invasive plant on phytoplankton and to compare the conditions of the phytoplankton community before and after Elodea nuttallii invasion. In the first stage of the research (2007-09) massive phytoplankton growth (max. biomass over 90 mg/L) and Cyanobacteria blooms (mainly of Aphanizornenon floc-aquae) were noted. Submerged vegetation along the shore was sparse and its development was inhibited by phytoplankton shading. Elodea nuttallii was first reported in this lake in 2009, together with native macrophyte species. The second stage of the research was carried out in the years 2013-15, when E. nuttallii had already colonised the lake, in some parts occupying the entire bottom surface and almost completely outcompeting native species of submerged macrophytes. As a consequence, the abundance and biomass of phytoplankton decreased. The highest biomass recorded in summer 2013-15 was approximately 4 mg/L. Secchi depth increased from 0.5 in in 2007-08 to 1.6 in in 2015. Elodea nuttallii expansion caused a shift from the turbid-water to clear-water state with higher water transparency. Phytoplankton blooms did not develop. The massive growth of E. nuttallii seems to have caused positive changes in the lake ecological status. However, E. nuttallii is considered to be a highly invasive species, threatening native hydrobionts at various levels of organisation.

J	Allee, WC				Allee, WC			Measurement of environmental factors in the tropical rain-forest of Panama	ECOLOGY												Original data are presented concerning barometric pressure, light intensity, wind velocity, evaporation and temperature within the rainforest on Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, Panama, during the dry season (January-March) 1924. Observations on barometric pressure were limited to the lowest stratum of the forest. With the other factors, studies were made of the vertical gradient obtaining between the ground and the region of the forest canopy some 80 or more feet above. The conditions prevailing above the forest are judged from data collected at ground level in forest-free situations nearby. There is little change in the barometric pressure in this region from one year to another, the total variation for a week amounting to 0.17 inch only. The horizontal air movement is practically nil near the ground. There is a gradient from a mean daily air movement of 1 mile per day at the forest floor to 10.1 miles per day in the forest canopy, and 240 miles per day in the unobstructed region above the forest. The air temperature near the ground out of sun flecks for 1 week shows a total variation of 1.6[degree]C; in the forest canopy, 86 feet higher, a total variation of 11[degree]C. The evaporating power of the air on the forest floor is approximately 1/2 that of the lower forest canopy and about 1/6 of that from the surface of the neighboring lake. This evaporation gradient is much less steep than that recorded by Fuller for the beech-maple forest of northern Indiana. Light intensity was measured with a MacBeth illumin-ometer and is reported in foot candles in detail, showing that there is relatively little variation from day to day or from day to night, out of sun flecks on the forest floor. The mean of 11 comparable midday readings was 18.3 foot candles. In the upper forest canopy the mean light intensity was 25 times greater, while in the open it was 442 times greater. Comparisons are made with the dense shade of a Manicaria (palm) rain-forest where a maximum light for the day of 2.2 foot candles was found at one station ; with the grassland of Panama, of Utah and of Chicago, and with conditions in a beech and maple forest in Indiana. The greatest intensity recorded in Panama was of 20,747 foot candles, which is to be compared with a maximum of 14,250 foot candles in Utah in mid-summer. Comparisons are also made with the work of MacLean in the forests of Brazil, of Shreve in Jamaica, and of Brown in the Philippines; and emphasis is laid upon the evidence for environmental constancy on the floor of the tropical rainforest.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1926	7						273	302		10.2307/1929311	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929311													WOS:000200148000027

The density of larvae was estimated in four lakes with contrasting water level regulation regimes in Central Finland using depth zone stratified bongo and tube net sampling in 2000-2022 and 2008-2022. In the regulated Tehinselk & auml;, larval density was also modeled as a function of the whitefish spawning stock, vendace stock indices, and water levels. Larger water level maximum drops during winter were observed in three regulated lakes (41-68 cm) than in the unregulated lake (35 cm). The average larval densities were highest in the unregulated Lake Southern Konnevesi and regulated Tehinselk & auml;, with densities >20 individuals ha(-1). The regulated lakes Ruotsalainen and Puula had lower average densities, <10 individuals ha(-1). Significant synchrony in the inter-annual variation in the density time series was observed between Tehinselk & auml; and S. Konnevesi as well as Tehinselk & auml; and Ruotsalainen. None of studied water level variables were associated with larval density in any lake. Thus, the small-scale regulation in these Finnish lakes did not show any direct effects on the production of whitefish larvae. Our analysis did not provide information on the potential effects of water level regulation on later life. For example, it did not cover the impact on whitefish food resources or the abundance of competitors and predators regulating whitefish growth and mortality in the juvenile stage.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174														2823-1465				OCT 30	2024	60								23	10.1051/limn/2024019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2024019													WOS:001345934600002
J	Poiger, T; Buser, HR; Balmer, ME; Bergqvist, PA; Müller, MD				Poiger, T; Buser, HR; Balmer, ME; Bergqvist, PA; Müller, MD			Occurrence of UV filter compounds from sunscreens in surface waters: regional mass balance in two Swiss lakes	CHEMOSPHERE												Consumer care products often contain UV filters, organic compounds which absorb ultraviolet light. These compounds may enter surface waters directly (when released from the skin during swimming and bathing) or indirectly via wastewater treatment plants (when released during showering or washed from textiles). Predicted and measured UV filter concentrations were compared in a regional mass balance study for two Swiss lakes: Lake Zurich, a typical midland lake which is also an important drinking water resource, and Huttnersee, a small bathing lake. Both lakes are extensively used for recreational activities and considerable direct input of UV filters is thus expected. This input was estimated from the number of visitors at swimming areas around the lakes and a survey of the usage of sunscreen products among these visitors. Possible additional indirect input via wastewater treatment plants was not considered in this study. The quantitatively most important UV filters, as indicated by the survey data, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, and benzophenone-3, all lipophilic compounds, were selected for analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Concentrations of individual UV filters in water from Lake Zurich were low, ranging from <2 ng l(-1) (detection limit) to 29 ng l(-1), and somewhat higher at Huttnersee, ranging from <2 to 125 ng l(-1), with the highest concentrations found in summer, consistent with direct inputs to the lakes during this time. The concentrations were clearly lower than predicted from input estimates based on the surveys. This may be in part due to (i) an overestimation of these inputs (e.g. less than the 50% wash-off of UV filters assumed to occur during swimming), and (ii) some removal of these compounds from the lakes by degradation and/or sorption/sedimentation. UV filters were also detected in semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) deployed at Lake Zurich and Greifensee, another midland lake, at concentrations of 80-950 ng SPMD-1, confirming the presence of the compounds in surface waters and indicating a certain potential for bioaccumulation. SPMD-derived water concentrations were in the range of 1-10 ng l(-1) and thus corresponded well with those determined in water directly. No UV filters were detected above blank levels in SPMDs deployed at a remote mountain lake used for background measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we infer the Holocene limnological changes in Emu Co, a proglacial lake in Nianbaoyuze on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, from sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) data, and palynomorph, element, lithological, and grain-size analyses. We developed a transfer function based on Siberia and Tibet/China surface sedimentary DNA and applied it to Emu Co sedaDNA to trace lake conductivity changes. The results show that the conductivity of Emu Co was high during 12.6-9.7 cal ka BP, often surpassing 1000 mu s cm(-1), driven by elevated summer solar radiation. The freshwater influx from glacial meltwater and precipitation, however, reduced the lake's conductivity as the climate warmed and humidified. This led to a decrease in the abundance of taxa characterised by high conductivity. Freshwater pulses, triggered by climatic fluctuations, likely led to significant variations in conductivity within the overarching downward trend. By 8 cal. ka BP, lake recharge conditions stabilised and conductivity reached a lower level of similar to 70 mu s cm(-1). The warm and humid mid-Holocene (8-5 cal. ka BP) provided suitable habitat conditions for many submerged freshwater taxa. After 5 cal. ka BP, the growth of submerged taxa was restricted, as indicated by a shift from asexual to sexual reproduction in macrophytes, likely in response to suboptimal conditions of a colder and drier climate. Since 1 cal. ka BP, human activities might have increased lake nutrient levels, with an enhanced richness of macrophytes. Our results indicate how millennial-scale hydrological changes in a lake are related to glacial retreat and catchment changes in the alpine region of the Tibetan Plateau, which is today facing climate change much greater than the global average.					; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019; Stoof-Leichsenring, Kathleen/E-2806-2014; hou, xiaohuan/HJB-1484-2022	Cao, Xianyong/0000-0001-5633-2256; Li, Wenjia/0000-0002-8406-7792; Stoof-Leichsenring, Kathleen R./0000-0002-6609-3217													0277-3791	1873-457X				AUG 15	2024	338								108806	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108806		JUL 2024											WOS:001277808100001
J	Chu, GQ; Liu, JQ				Chu GuoQiang; Liu JiaQi			Maar lakes in China and their significance in paleoclimatic research	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA												As research progress in the Past Global Changes, scientists understand that Earth's paleoclimate varies at quasi-periodicities ranging from millennial to decadal timescale and intervened by abrupt paleoclimatic events besides the low-frequency orbital variations. In order to well understand these variations, the time resolution of paleoclimatic archives should be at annual-decadal timescale, and cover longer time scale and enrich in paleoclimatic information. Maar Lakes are the products of Phreatomagmatic volcanic eruptions. They can provide a continuously sedimentary record spanning hundreds of thousands of years. In China, Maar lakes distribute from tropical to the North Temperate Zone, and are ideal documents for studying regional climatic variability and dynamics at different temporal scales. In view of Maar lakes in China, we present some scientific questions that may be obtained from Maar lake archives. On the orbital timescale, a challenging scientific question is what time the next glacial age will be onset. The sedimentary record in tropical maar lakes in southern China span at least four glacial-interglacial cycles. They provide excellent document for understanding scientific questions such as predicting the onset of next ice age, the interaction of ice sheet dynamics and carbon cycle, and links between high and low latitude. On the millennial timescale, one of the puzzling features of Earth's past climate is that a series of paleoclimatic oscillations occurred roughly at millennial years and abrupt paleoclimatic events recorded in paleoclimatic archives. They may be inherent nature in Earth, but with different physical appearances and dynamic origins. In order to gain an overall view on a hemispherical scale, regional sedimentary documents derived from different localities will greatly help us to integrate regional data and understand dynamics between atmospheres and oceans. On annual to decadal timescale, the paleoclimatic data of last two millennia is a key data-base of global network. As a basis for evaluating and projecting global changes, PAGES, IPCC and Asia-2K are striving for this goal. Archives from sediments of Maar lakes, especially annually laminated sediments, will provide high-resolution dataset in data-sparse regions.

SAV was assessed using a combined transect survey/spatial mapping approach, emergent vegetation was quantified with aerial photography and GIS, and bass were surveyed by electro-shocking. During the period leading up to this study (1995-1999), water levels were high in the lake, and the SAV was reduced in spatial extent and biomass, compared to its condition in the early 1990s. Spatial extent of emergent vegetation also was low, and largemouth bass surveys indicated low densities and failure to recruit young fish into the population. This was attributed to the lack of critical vegetative habitat. In spring 2000, the lake was lowered by discharging water from major outlets, and this was followed by a regional drought. Water levels dropped by I in, and there was widespread development of Chara lawns in shoreline areas, with coincident increases in water clarity. There was some germination of vascular SAV, but Chara was the extreme dominant, such that structural complexity remained low. There was no substantive improvement in bass recruitment. During 2001, water levels declined further, and emergent plants germinated in exposed areas of the lake bottom. SAV was restricted to sites farther offshore, and continued to be dominated by Chara. There again was no bass response. In 2002, conditions changed when water levels increased to a moderate depth, flooding shoreline habitat to similar to 0.5 in. Vascular SAV increased in biomass and spatial extent, such that the community developed a high structural complexity. At the same time, emergent aquatic plants developed dense stands along the western shoreline. Largemouth bass had a strong recruitment of young fish for the first time in 5 years. Recruitment continued to be successful in 2003, when spatial extent of SAV was somewhat reduced by higher water but total biomass and diversity remained high. These results demonstrate an important effect of inter-annual variation in water depth on the population dynamics of aquatic plants and fish in a subtropical lake.																			0018-8158					MAY 1	2005	539						225	237		10.1007/s10750-004-4876-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-4876-1													WOS:000231029600022
J	Edvardsson, J; Helama, S; Rundgren, M; Nielsen, AB				Edvardsson, Johannes; Helama, Samuli; Rundgren, Mats; Nielsen, Anne Birgitte			The Integrated Use of Dendrochronological Data and Paleoecological Records From Northwest European Peatlands and Lakes for Understanding Long-Term Ecological and Climatic Changes-A Review	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Our overall understanding of long-term climate dynamics is largely based on proxy data generated from archives such as ice cores, ocean sediments, tree rings, speleothems, and corals, whereas reconstructions of long-term changes in vegetation and associated climate during the Holocene are largely based on paleoecological records from peat and lake sequences, primarily pollen and plant macrofossil data. However, since no proxy can provide a complete picture of the past, it is important to integrate different types of data, and to use methods that can support the paleoecological and paleoclimatic interpretations. Here we review how tree-ring data and dendrochronological approaches can be integrated with stratigraphic records to provide complementary paleoecological and paleoclimatic information. The review includes multiproxy studies in which dendrochronological data have been either compared or integrated with stratigraphic records, mainly pollen records, with the aim to contribute to a better understanding of long-term ecosystem and climate dynamics. We mainly focus on studies from northwest Europe in which tree-ring data and at least one type of paleoecological proxy record from the same site or area has been either compared or integrated. We find that integration of dendrochronological data and paleoecological records from peat and lake sequences is a powerful but underutilized approach to reconstruct long-term ecological and climatic changes. One likely reason for its limited use is the contrasting character of the two categories of data, including their different time resolution and occurrence, making them difficult to integrate. For example, subfossil wood providing annual dendrochronological data usually only occurs sporadically in peat and lake sediments, and the presence/absence of the trees are normally expected to be recorded in the pollen data with multi-decadal or coarser resolution. Therefore, we also discuss methods to compare and integrate dendrochronological and stratigraphic records, as well as the relevant paleoecological and paleoclimatic information provided by dendrochronology, pollen, and peat stratigraphy, with the aim to facilitate new multi-proxy initiatives that will contribute to a better understanding of long-term ecosystem and climate dynamics and thereby a firmer basis for future nature conservation initiatives.

Carbon dioxide and submersed macrophytes in lakes: linking functional ecology to community composition	ECOLOGY												Evaluating plant community response to atmospheric CO2 rise is critical to predicting ecosystem level change. Freshwater lakes offer a model system for examining CO2 effects as submersed macrophyte species differ greatly in their growth responses to CO2 enrichment, and free CO2 concentrations among these habitats show a wide range of natural, spatial variation. We determined free CO2 concentrations in the water column and sediment porewater in littoral zones with pH < 6.0 in Adirondack Mountain (New York, USA) lakes, and derived a community CO2 responsiveness index (CCRI) based on quantitative sampling of 15 submersed macrophyte communities coupled with greenhouse-derived growth responses to CO2 enrichment of constituent species to test two hypotheses: (1) CCRI, which is higher for communities dominated by species with greater growth responses to CO2 enrichment, is positively correlated to free [CO2] in the water column, and (2) in natural communities, the percent of sediment CO2-using species, which are relatively unresponsive to CO2 enrichment, is negatively correlated to free [CO2]. A significant positive correlation (P = 0.003) between our physiologically based CCRI and the concentration of free CO2 in the water column supported our primary hypothesis that sites with higher levels of free CO2 are dominated by species with greater growth responses to CO2 enrichment. Our CCRI is also highly significantly correlated (P < 0.001) to the first axis scores for the same vegetation data from polar ordination. Finally, the relative importance of species that use sediment CO2 as a photosynthetic carbon source is significantly negatively correlated (P = 0.029) with the concentration of free CO2 in the water column. Our results indicate that natural variations in CO2 levels are important determinants of submersed macrophyte community composition. Further, we demonstrate the utility of a physiologically-based index of community composition, our CCRI, as an ecologically valid measure of community response to CO2.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	2017	98	12					3096	3105		10.1002/ecy.2030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2030								29063587					WOS:000416863500011

During the summer of 1990 the colonies were dispersed in the well-mixed upper epilimnion of the main lake basins but formed light surface scums along leeward shores and in sheltered bays, including Mitchell Wyke. The gas vesicles of this species were found to be much stronger (p(c)0.93 MPa) than those in other Anabaena species; they would withstand exposure to hydrostatic pressures at depths exceeding 40 m and they would therefore survive deep-mixing events in this lake. The colonies were highly buoyant; they required only 46% of their gas vesicles to render 50% of the colonies neutrally buoyant in one sample. In another sample the buoyant density of colonies with intact gas vesicles was 975 kg m-3 compared with 1022 kg m-3 after gas vesicles collapse, which indicated that only 51% of the gas vesicles were need to give the same density as water. In a third sample comparison of the mean colony floation rate of 181-mu-m s-1 before gas vesicle collapse with the sinking rate of 186-mu-m s-1 after collapse also demonstrated that 51% of the gas vesicles were required for neutral buoyancy. Colonies incubated in two bottles at the lake surface failed to respond to the high irradiance by losing their buoyancy. It was calculated that the colonies would not have been able to accumulate sufficient carbohydrate in a day to overcome the excess buoyancy provided by their gas vesicles; the high critical pressure of the gas vesicles prevented their collapse by turgor pressure rise. The inability of highly buoyant cyanobacteria to lose buoyancy may provide a general explanation for the persistence of cyanobacterial surface water-blooms.

Prokaryotic Plankton and Viruses in the Waters of the Fram Strait in the Winter Period	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												New data have been obtained on the distribution of prokaryotic plankton and pelagic viruses in the Fram Strait (the Greenland Sea) during the polar night (late November). Three main types of water masses were present in the study area: surface polar, Atlantic, and transformed Atlantic. The content of mineral biogenic elements increased with depth. The concentration of chlorophyll a had low values (0.07-0.13 mg/m(3)). The abundance and biomass of prokaryotes varied from 286000 to 675000 cells/mL and from 2.7 to 11.7 mg C/m(3), respectively. The composition of prokaryotic plankton was dominated by single small cells (more than 97% of the abundance and more than 68% of the biomass). The average cell volume was 0.034-0.096 mu m(3). The number of viruses varied from 724000 to 3920000 particles/mL, and the biomass varied from 0.040 to 0.216 mu g C/m(3). Against the background of local maxima in the abundance of prokaryotic plankton in the 0-25 m layer, the highest concentrations of viruses were noted in the surface layer. In the latitudinal distribution (from south to north), an increase in the number of viruses and prokaryotes was revealed. A close relationship between their abundance and biomass with hydrological parameters and phosphate content was established; the role of certain water masses in the vertical distribution of microbes was insignificant. The relatively high abundance of viruses and prokaryotes indicated their significant activity during the polar night.

J	Fu, AH; Chen, YN; Li, WH				Fu AiHong; Chen YaNing; Li WeiHong			Water use strategies of the desert riparian forest plant community in the lower reaches of Heihe River Basin, China	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The object of this paper is the different plant communities in the Ejina desert riparian forest. Groundwater depth, soil moisture, plant water potential, relative leaf moisture content and water use efficiency was monitored, and the response of soil moisture and plant ecology to the groundwater depth and the water use efficiency of the different plant communities was analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Along with the groundwater depth increasing, predawn and midday water potential of the plants, with the exception of Reaumuria soongorica, did not decrease significantly, indicating that when the groundwater depth is less than 3 m, the plant communities in the range of 4 km from the river way did not suffer or slightly suffer from water stress; (2) The distribution of higher soil moisture content within 0-3 m soil layer is suitable with the plants' root system, as indicated in the communities of coexisting overripe Populus euphratica or Taramrix chinensis, both of which can release excessive water into soil for shallow rooted shrubs or herbaceous plants when there is water shortage; (3) R. soongorica can absorb deep soil moisture through deep roots for their own survival; (4) The community consisting of Sophora alopecuroides, Karelinia caspica, T. chinensis, and overripe P. euphratica has the best species combination for restoring the damaged eco-environment in the lower reaches of Heihe River; (5) The order of plants' relative leaf water contents is K. caspica > S. alopecuroides > young P. euphratica > overripe P. euphratica > mature P. euphratica = T. chinensis coexisting with other species > single R. soongorica > single T. chinensis and the order of WUE is single T. chinensis > single R. soongorica > T. chinensis living in symbiosis with other species > S. alopecuroides = young P. euphratica > mature P. euphratica > overripe P. euphratica > K. caspica. Therefore, with ample soil moisture, the plant community helps rapid growth of T. chinensis, young P. euphratica and R. soongorica plants of less moisture content. Despite this they do not have much water storage capability, but have strong drought resistance, and higher moisture contents of S. alopecuroides and K. caspica, thus leaving them with poor drought resistance. Overall, the desert riparian forest plant community in the lower reaches of Heihe River helps the species of higher WUE live on it.					付, 爱红/HKO-6580-2023; chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020														1674-7313	1869-1897				JUN	2014	57	6					1293	1305		10.1007/s11430-013-4680-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-013-4680-8													WOS:000336380400015

Incursion of a large-volume, spatter-bearing pyroclastic density current into a caldera lake: Pavey Ark ignimbrite, Scafell caldera, England	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Scafell caldera-lake volcaniclastic succession is exceptionally well exposed. At the eastern margin of the caldera, a large andesitic explosive eruption (> 5 km(3)) generated a high-mass-flux pyroclastic density current that flowed into the caldera lake for several hours and deposited the extensive Pavey Ark ignimbrite. The ignimbrite comprises a thick (similar to 125 m), proximal, spatter- and scoria-rich breccia that grades laterally and upwards into massive lapilli-tuff, which, in turn, is gradationally overlain by massive and normal-graded tuff showing evidence of soft-state disruption. The subaqueous pyroclastic current carried juvenile clasts ranging from fine ash to metre-scale blocks and from dense andesite through variably vesicular scoria to pumice (< 10(3) kg m(-3)). Extreme ignimbrite lithofacies diversity resulted via particle segregation and selective deposition from the current. The lacustrine proximal ignimbrite breccia mainly comprises clast- to matrix-supported blocks and lapilli of vesicular andesite, but includes several layers rich in spatter (similar to 1.7 m diameter) that was emplaced in a ductile, hot state. In proximal locations, rapid deposition of the large and dense clasts caused displacement of interstitial fluid with elutriation of low-density lapilli and ash upwards, so that these particles were retained in the current and thus overpassed to medial and distal reaches. Medially, the lithofacies architecture records partial blocking, channelling and reflection of the depletive current by substantial basin-floor topography that included a lava dome and developing fault scarps. Diffuse layers reflect surging of the sustained current, and the overall normal grading reflects gradually waning flow with, finally, a transition to suspension sedimentation from an ash-choked water column. Fine to extremely fine tuff overlying the ignimbrite forms similar to 25% of the whole and is the water-settled equivalent of co-ignimbrite ash; its great thickness (similar to 55 m) formed because the suspended ash was trapped within an enclosed basin and could not drift away. The ignimbrite architecture records widespread caldera subsidence during the eruption, involving volcanotectonic faulting of the lake floor. The eruption was partly driven by explosive disruption of a groundwater-hydrothermal system adjacent to the magma reservoir.

Traditional models often overlook the complex coupling mechanisms between ice and ocean waves, especially the two-way processes where ice attenuates wave energy and waves break ice floes. This oversight can also intensify modeling challenges in coastal areas, including large lakes, where ice-wave interactions influence storm surges, high waves, and coastal erosion. To address this gap, this paper introduces an enhanced modeling approach that integrates both ice-induced wave attenuation and wave- induced ice breakage. To implement these processes, the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) is coupled with an unstructured-grid wave model (SWAN) and the unstructured-grid version of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (UG-CICE) to form the FVCOM-SWAVE-UG-CICE framework. Using this fully coupled model, simulations were conducted for the Great Lakes. Results of the modeled ice concentration, ice thickness, and significant wave heights were reported and validated against observational data from the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) and in-situ under-ice measurements. To further study the coupling effects, results of the proposed model were also compared with those from no coupling and one-way coupling (focusing only on ice-induced wave attenuation) models. Comparative analyses demonstrated significant improvements in the predicted ice concentration with the proposed fully coupled model. These findings reveal the importance of incorporating ice-wave interactions inaccurately predicting ice cover dynamics in freshwater systems.

Investigation of the ecology of winter plankton of Lake Baikal using complex instrumental methods	SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT												Aim. The continuous monitoring of changes in ecosystems must be carried out in connection with global climate changes that affect the state of water bodies. Remote sensing methods have many advantages as a promising method for monitoring biocenoses in large water bodies. We carried out a comprehensive study comparing the results obtained using the latest instruments and methods to expand their further application to the continuous monitoring of water bodies. Material and Methods. The field research was undertaken using hydroacoustic sensors, submersible holographic camera and high-resolution thermal sensors in addition to the classical methods of studying the zooplankton ecology - the Juday net and CTD probe. Water temperature, chlorophyll, photosynthetically active radiation and other parameters were measured with an AAQ-Rinko probe. We provided data for one vertical up to a depth of 100 m. Results. The main components of mesozooplankton during the ice period are different age stages of the endemic crustacean Epischura baikalensis Sars 1900 and several rotifer species. The article discusses the heterogeneity of the environment and the distribution of plankton detected by various instruments. Conclusion. The experimental results obtained with the help of a set of devices show that the distribution of zooplankton is very strongly dependent on the physical parameters of the environment. The use of remote sensing methods is an important step towards the automation of basic monitoring of the ecosystem of Lake Baikal and other water bodies. The obtained field data will make it possible to further improve the pattern recognition algorithm in the software of the holographic installation for the specific conditions of Lake Baikal. The results of the vertical distribution and migrations of zooplankton in connection with environmental parameters are assumed to be processed using mathematical modeling methods.

J	Keays, RR; Lightfoot, PC				Keays, Reid R.; Lightfoot, Peter C.			Mafic intrusions in the footwall of the Sudbury Igneous Complex: Origin of the Sudbury impact melt sheet and its associated ore deposits	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The majority of the mafic intrusions and volcanic rocks in the footwall of the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC), which is believed to have formed from a melt sheet produced by the impact of a very large bolide, belong to one of two large mafic igneous suites, viz: the similar to 2450 Ma East Bull Lake (EBL) suite of intrusions or the similar to 2200 Ma Nipissing Diabase suite of intrusions. This has been established by U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating of zircons from the newly recognized Frood intrusion, which hosts the Frood and Stobie ore bodies, and two of the Sudbury Gabbro intrusions, and comparison of the geochemistry of these intrusions with that of the EBL intrusive suite and the Nipissing Diabase suite. The age of the Frood intrusion (2421 +/- 32 Ma) falls within error of other EBL-type intrusions whereas the ages of the Nairn (2203 +/- 11 Ma) and Totten (2168 +/- 11 Ma) intrusions fall within error of published ages for the Nipissing Diabase. Moreover, the primitive mantle-normalized patterns of the petrogenetic trace elements on extended spidergrams of the Nairn and Totten Sudbury Gabbros are similar to those of the Nipissing Diabase as are those of the Frood intrusion to other members of the EBL intrusive suite. The Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide deposits at Sudbury are associated with the lower contact of the SIC, where a discontinuous inclusion-rich norite contains much of the mineralization at the contact, and an inclusion-bearing quartz diorite is directly associated with the mineralization of the radial and concentric offset dykes. The Sublayer rocks and the overlying unit of melanocratic norites provide strong evidence for a relationship between the ore deposits and both inclusions and melts of mafic-ultramafic target rocks. The most common pre-impact mafic-ultramafic target rocks are intrusions of the EBL and Nipissing Diabase suites, although there are also Archean-aged mafic-ultramafic enclaves in the gneisses beneath the North Range of the SIC. The Totten orebody in the Worthington Offset and the Kelly Lake ore body in the Copper Cliff Offset are directly associated with footwall rocks comprising Sudbury Gabbro and Nipissing Gabbro, respectively, whereas the Frood-Stobie Offset and the associated Frood and Stobie ore deposits are sandwiched in a breccia belt containing large rafts of amphibole megacrystic gabbro belonging to the extensively broken-up Frood intrusion. Olivine-bearing mafic and ultramafic rocks, some of which exhibit shock metamorphic features, but others do not, are common inclusion types and occur in diverse Sublayer environments. The unshocked melanorite and olivine melanorite inclusions share common geochemical characteristicsde, indicating that they were derived from a similar source. Their geochemistry is also similar to that of the Frood Intrusion as well as the East Bull Lake intrusion; this indicates that they may have been sourced from East Bull Lake-type intrusions that were incorporated into the melt sheet at the time of melt generation. Mass balance calculations indicate that the felsic country rocks which account for 77% of the total volume of the SIC and contain 18 ppm Ni and 21 ppm Cu together with the sulfide-poor mafic country rocks which account for 23% of the SIC and contain 133 ppm Ni and 92 ppm Cu have too little Ni and Cu to account for the Ni and Cu contents of the quartz diorite, the composition of which provides an indication of that of the initial melt sheet. Calculations using the R-factor equation of Campbell and Naldrett (1979) indicate that the magmas that formed the norites and the ore deposits had 137 ppm Ni and 121 ppm Cu. Mass balance calculations have been used to determine if the country rocks have sufficient Ni and Cu in them to generate the ore deposits. The weighted median Ni content of the sulfide poor (< 200 ppm Cu) mafic country rocks is 133 ppm and hence very similar to that of the ore-forming magma. However, the weighted median Cu contents of these rocks is only 90 ppm and hence too low to provide all of the Cu required by the ore-forming magma. What the mass balance calculation shows is that a contribution of Cu (and Ni) in the ore-forming magma was derived from pre-existing Ni-Cu-PGE sulphides associated with the mafic target rocks. This contribution was diluted by the lower concentrations of Ni and Cu from the Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks and the Archean granitoids and gneisses. For this reason, a contribution from magmatic sulfides in the mafic target rocks is required, and this may have been similar to the known disseminated concentrations of Cu-PGE-Ni sulfides present in mafic intrusions in the Sudbury area.																			0169-1368	1872-7360				MAY	2020	120								103435	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103435													WOS:000530673300052
J	Bookman, R; Enzel, Y; Agnon, A; Stein, M				Bookman, R; Enzel, Y; Agnon, A; Stein, M			Late Holocene lake levels of the Dead Sea	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												This work presents a high-resolution lake-level record of the late Holocene Dead Sea, a hypersaline terminal lake whose drainage basin encompasses both Mediterranean and hyperarid climatic zones. The lake-level curve reflects the regional hydrologic variations in the drainage basin, which in turn represent the Levant paleoclimates. The curve is based on 46 radiocarbon ages of organic remains from well-exposed sedimentary sequences along the Dead Sea shores. These sequences record fluvial and lacustrine depositional environments. The paleolakeshores are marked by shore ridges, coarse-sand units, and aragonite crusts; in the modern Dead Sea, such features indicate the exact elevation of the shore. The late Holocene Dead Sea level fluctuated within the range of 390 to 415 m below sea level (mbsl). For most of the time the lake was below the topographic sill (402 mbsl) separating the northern and southern basins of the Dead Sea and was confined to the deep northern basin. Nevertheless, short-term rises in the late Holocene Dead Sea level caused the flooding of the shallow and flat southern basin. Highstands occurred in the second and first centuries B.C. and the fourth century A.D. during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, respectively, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. during the Crusader period, and at the end of the nineteenth century A.D. The rises mark a significant change in the annual rainfall in the region, which likely exceeded the instrumentally measured modern average. The curve also indicates drastic drops that exposed the sedimentary sequences to erosion. The oldest and probably deepest drop in the lake level culminated during the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C. after a retreat from a higher lake stand. The longest lowstand occurred after the Byzantine period and continued at least until the ninth century A.D. This and period coincided with the invasion of Moslem-Arab tribes into the area during the seventh century A.D. The dramatic fall of the Dead Sea level during the twentieth century is primarily artificial and has been caused by the diversion of runoff water for the drainage basin, but the magnitude is not considered exceptional for the late Holocene. Although the past drops in the lake never exceeded the modern artificial drop rates, they do represent extreme and conditions that occurred frequently over the past several thousand years.

J	Brown, JA; Martins, T; Cerny, P				Brown, Jarrod A.; Martins, Tania; Cerny, Petr			THE TANCO PEGMATITE AT BERNIC LAKE, MANITOBA. XVII. MINERALOGY AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF ALKALI FELDSPARS	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												The alkali-feldspar paragenetic sequence in the Tanco pegmatite spans the entire crystallization and cooling history of the pegmatite and includes several different K-feldspar and albite varieties. Total feldspar modal abundance approaches 50% for the entire pegmatite volume. Blocky K-feldspar, aplitic albite, and albite of the cleavelandite habit together account for most of the total feldspar volume, whereas late, low-temperature feldspars in veins and cavities are mostly contained in inner zones associated with pollucite and petalite. In an inward progression through the concentrically zoned pegmatite, average bulk compositional data for blocky K-feldspar reveal steady increases in Rb2O (1.45-3.08 wt.%) and Cs2O (0.11-0.29 wt.%), increasing followed by decreasing contents of P2O5 (0.34-0.47 wt.%), Li2O (0.014-0.095 wt.%), and Tl (105-239 ppm), decreasing Na2O (2.5-1.1 wt.%) and CaO (0.13-0.08 wt.%), and variable BaO (0.004-0.17 wt.%) and Ga2O3 (0.006-0.010 wt.%). In aplitic albite and albite of the cleavelandite habit, CaO decreases (0.08-0.03 wt.%) and overall K2O and P2O5 contents are variable. Late adularia feldspars from veins and clusters in pollucite exhibit extreme ranges in contents of Rb2O (1.80-24.84 wt.%) and Cs2O (0.10-1.43 wt.%) and significant P2O5 (up to 0.51 wt.%). X-ray powder-diffraction data indicate near-maximum structural order of the early feldspar varieties as maximum microcline and high albite. Hydrothermal adularia crystals are essentially endmember (Or(100)) high sanidine. The large and economically significant Tanco pegmatite represents an extreme in terms of petrologic processes involving fractional and disequilibrium crystallization from granitic melts enriched in volatiles and fluxing components (H2O, B, F, P), rare alkalis (Li, Rb, Cs), and high field strength elements (Ta, Nb, Zr, Hf). The alkali feldspars are the most significant carriers of P, Li, Rb, Tl, and Cs prior to the stabilization of large volumes of amblygonite-montebrasite, petalite, lepidolite, and pollucite. The rise and fall of trace-element content in feldspars, in relation to the spatial distribution of different zones and mineral assemblages, has implications in terms of the internal evolution of complex granitic pegmatites, as well as on the types and extents of subsolidus readjustments.																			0008-4476	1499-1276				MAY 1	2017	55	3					483	500		10.3749/canmin.1700008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3749/canmin.1700008													WOS:000405809100007

Environmental and geodynamic settings of the earliest hominin migration to the Arabian-Caucasus region: A review	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					INQUA-SEQS-DATESTRA Meeting	SEP 09-15, 2017	EPCC Ctr European Rech Prehistoriques Tautavel, Tautavel, FRANCE	UMR 7194 HNHP CNRS, MNHN UPVD CERP Tautavel, Univ Perpignan, INQUA, SEQS, DATESTRA	EPCC Ctr European Rech Prehistoriques Tautavel			Majority of researchers consider the Arabian-Caucasus region as a corridor for migration of earliest hominins from their African motherland to Eurasia. The paper is devoted to geological position of main stratified localities of the earliest Paleolithic industries in the Arabian-Caucasus region and estimation of environment of creators of these industries. The following early Paleolithic localities are analyzed: 'Ubeidiya in Israel, middle Orontes River, Halabiyeh-Zalabiyeh area in the Euphrates River valley, and Ain al Fil in Syria, Dursunlu in Central Turkey, Sambayat, Bostancik, Eskimalatya, and Kovancilar in Eastern Turkey, Karakhach, Muradovo, Agvoric, and Jradzor in NW Armenia, Dmanisi in Southern Georgia, the Azykh cave in Nagornyi Karabakh, Muhkai II in Dagestan, and Kermek in the Taman Peninsula. The evolution of large and small mammals and palynological data on changes of vegetation from the Late Pliocene to the early Middle Pleistocene are studied to determine the age of the earliest Paleolithic industries and climatic conditions of that epoch. Combined analysis of paleontological, paleomagnetic and radio-isotopic data and geological correlation of the sections available for the Halabiyeh-Zalabiyeh, Sambayat, Kovancilar, Karakhach, Dmanisi, Muhkai II, and Kermek localities shows that their age is ranged in time interval ca. 2.0-1.7 Ma. The 1.7-1.6 Ma age of the lowest layers of 'Ubeidiya with Oldowan-type artefacts probably marks the end of this epoch. Removal of topographic effects of the late Calabrian and younger tectonic uplifts and offsets on major strike-slip faults shows that the topography of the late Gelasian - early Calabrian was much lower and less differentiated and main river systems were more passable than in the present time. The climate of the end of Gelasian was wet and relatively warm, with meadowsteppe and forest-steppe savanna-type vegetation in basins and valleys and coniferous and coniferous-broad-leaved forests in the mountains. Abundance of vegetation was supported by water resources of numerous rivers, lakes, and springs in the intermountain basins and valleys that were controlled partly by fault activity. This stimulated abundance of herbivorous mammals. In spite of relative aridisation at the beginning of Calabrian, vegetation continued to be freely available for herbivores. Hominin dispersal into the region was supported by rich resources of herbivores during the late Gelasian - early Calabrian time.

These approaches vary across countries due to differences in epidemiology and public health policies. We conducted an eight-year active surveillance program in the Poyang Lake region, a critical wintering site along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, to investigate the correlation between poultry and environmental samples. From February 2017 to June 2024, 7570 poultry and environmental samples were collected and tested in Nanchang, the largest city in the Poyang Lake region, revealing an overall avian influenza positivity rate of 40.1 %. In 2017, the poultry and environmental positivity rates were 16.9 % and 15.5 %, respectively. By 2024, these rates had risen to 69.4 % and 77.7 %, respectively, with significant and consistent annual increases observed in both environmental and poultry samples. Specifically, in poultry surveillance, chickens (54.2 %) showed higher overall AIV positivity rates compared to ducks (30.6 %), and oropharyngeal swabs (45.5 %) demonstrated greater sensitivity than cloacal swabs (22.3 %). Analysis of environmental samples revealed that, compared with smear samples (39.0 %) and fecal samples (30.9 %), sewage samples (46.5 %) exhibit superior sensitivity. Correlation and wavelet coherence analyses revealed a significant relationship between environmental and poultry samples. In scenarios where poultry sampling is unavailable, environmental surveillance can complement and potentially serve as an alternative to poultry surveillance.<br /> (c) 2025 The Authors.

J	Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Cirujano, S				Rodrigo, Maria A.; Rojo, Carmen; Alvarez-Cobelas, Miguel; Cirujano, Santos			Chara hispida beds as a sink of nitrogen:: Evidence from growth, nitrogen uptake and decomposition	AQUATIC BOTANY												Chara hispida forms dense beds (0.78-0.95 kg DW m(-2)) in Colgada Lake. The ability of Chara meadows to act as a nitrogen source or sink was evaluated by the following methods: (1) investigating Chara growth, (2) nitrogen incorporation and decomposition laboratory experiments and (3) relating experimental results to field conditions. Sediment oospores were germinated in large aquaria and observed growth rates were 0.00 1 m day(-1) (shoot length) and 0.0002 g day(-1) (dry weight). Nitrogen uptake rates were determined by addition of K 15 NO3 during two different periods of Chara growth and the rates were 1.21 and 3.86 RM g DW-1 h(-1) when charophytes were 166 days old (not sexually mature) and 323 days old (sexually mature), respectively. After the uptake experiments, the same charophytes were allowed to decompose within two types of litter bags (3 mm-pore litter bags and entire, non-porous plastic litter bags). Decomposition rates of Ch. hispida were 0.016 and 0.009 day(-1) in perforated and non-perforated bags, respectively, and fit a negative exponential model. The nitrogen release rate, calculated as the disappearance of N content from Chara tissues, was 0.012 day(-1) and there were no statistically significant differences between the values from the two different bag types. The dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in aquarium and non-perforated litter bags waters increased linearly with time due to the leaching of soluble compounds from Chara. The rate of N loss from Chara tissues, total nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen release rates and the decrease in initial dry weight rate were all lower than the daily rate of Chara N uptake. By extrapolating laboratory data to field situations, we determined that approximately 38% of the N taken up by charophytes in Colgada Lake during the growth period is retained. Given the high charophyte biomass in the lake, its ability to incorporate nitrogen, its low decomposition rate and its ability to over-winter, we conclude that Chara beds could be acting as nitrogen sinks in this ecosystem.

J	Starzecka, A; Bednarz, T				Starzecka, A; Bednarz, T			Upper Vistula River: Response of aquatic communities to pollution and impoundment. V. Photosynthetic and respiratory activity of seston	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												From March 1997 to March 1998 the photosynthesis (PhS) and respiration of seston (Rs) and bacteria fraction (Rb) in the water of the Upper Vistula River on the section from 10.9 to 336.7 kin of the river course were investigated. Methods applied: PhS - light and dark bottles, Rs dark bottles. Rb - respiration of bacterial fraction, which was isolated by water filtration. The smallest mean yearly value of PhS (2.1-8.6 J dm(-3) 24 h(-1)) was found at 10.9-36.6 km of the river course and the greatest ones (40.4-42.7 J dm(-3) 24 h(-1)) at 248.2-336.7 km, in accordance with the size of the river. Rs was the smallest (23.9-28.7 J dm(-3) 24 h(-1)) between 10.9-45.7 km of the river course (on the rather clean sector) and decisively greater (51.6 J dm(-3) 24 h(-1)) at 115.6 km at the most polluted sites. Along longitudinal profile of the Upper Vistula River Rb was equalized and ranged from 20.7 to 24.1 J dm(-3) 24h(-1), with the exception at 10.9 (spring, clean part of the river, poor in seston) and 336.7 km of the river course, where it was 10-20% smaller. The last value might indicated the presence of organic matter easily available to bacteria at this site. Rb constituted from 45 to 78% of seston Rs with the minimal value at 115.6 km of the river course (the most polluted) and its maximal participation at 10.9 km - clean part of the river, rather poor in seston.																			1505-2249						2002	50	2					157	166																WOS:000179318500005
J	Olesen, B; Maberly, SC				Olesen, B; Maberly, SC			The effect of high levels of visible and ultra-violet radiation on the photosynthesis of phytoplankton from a freshwater lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rates of oxygen production of a natural population of phytoplankton from a freshwater lake were measured in situ at mid-summer under near-maximal irradiances for PAR (400-700 nm), UV-B (280-315 nm) and UV-A (320-400 nm). The radiation climate was altered by incubation at different depths, and hence different PAR, and by using flasks which cut-off different amounts of UV-radiation: quartz flasks transmitted all wavelengths >280 nm, glass flasks had a 50 % transmission at 309 nm and glass flasks with a plastic shield had 50 % transmission at 354 nm. At 0.01 and 0.11 m, rates of oxygen consumption in the light were greater than dark respiration in all flasks. but were particularly high in the full UV treatment. possibly as a result of photochemical degradation of dissolved organic carbon. Gross oxygen production was achieved in all flask types at depths of 0.41, 0.53 and 1.1m but rates were lowest under the full UV-spectrum. An ANOVA showed a significant variation in rate of gross photosynthesis with depth and type of flask. A multiple-regression against received flux of PAR, UVA and UV-B explained 81 % of the variation in gross photosynthesis but oo-variation of irradiance with depth prevented the effect of the different wavebands to be separated statistically. The biological weighting function of CULLEN et al. (1992) for the inhibition of photosynthesis by ultraviolet radiation for a marine phytoplankter, explained 80 % of the variation in our data but we could not distinguish between two scenarios with different sensitivity to UV radiation. Extrapolation to in-situ conditions suggested that UV-A radiation was more inhibitory than UV-B radiation.

We aimed to explore the male-partner role in contraceptive decision-making, and describe ideal male-partner roles and how they relate to contraceptive use, specifically uptake of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Study design: We used a phenomenological approach to explore cis-hetero partner involvement in contraceptive decision-making and conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 30 cisgender women and 30 cisgender men in heterosexual relationships who presented to Salt Lake City family planning clinics. Participants, stratified by sex assigned at birth and current contraceptive method (LARC vs non-LARC), described the male-partner's role in the most recent contraceptive decision and discussed how idealpartner involvement could look in contraceptive decision-making. We iteratively developed a codebook and identified dominant themes using a constant content and comparative analysis. Results: We did not identify thematic differences by LARC vs non-LARC users. Participants universally considered that contraceptive responsibility falls on women. At the time of the interviews, both men and women indicated a strong desire to prevent pregnancy, and felt that men's actual contributions to decision-making were limited. Themes around gendered-differences of contraceptive knowledge, responsibility and risk, and sexual priorities emerged, as well as inadequate knowledge and contraception options for men. In analyzing discussion around ideal partner support, participants suggested emotional, financial, and logistical support options and placed high importance on interpersonal communication. Conclusions: The decision to use a method of LARC did not influence sentiments around male-partner involvement or stated desire for partner involvement. Limited contraceptive knowledge and male options restrict the contraceptive decision-making role and contraceptive engagement for men, although participants suggested other supportive options. Implications: This work suggests the desire of both men and women for men to participate in contraceptive decision-making, but their role remains limited. Future interventions focused on comprehensive contraceptive education and modeling of communication strategies for men are tangible steps to support men in this role.

Combining the Mg/Ca of the ostracod Cyprideis torosa with its ontogenic development for reconstructing a 28 kyr temperature record for Lake Banyoles (NE Spain)	JOURNAL OF MICROPALAEONTOLOGY												Cyprideis torosa is a ubiquitous ostracod found in fresh to hypersaline waters, and commonly in large numbers across the Mediterranean region. Single valves of 51 adult specimens of C. torosa were separated from carapaces that were collected from Lake Banyoles in NE Spain at a depth of 5 m. The Mg/Ca of the valves was compared with known temperatures necessary for successive instar valve calcification, the latter being based on a four-year ecological study of C. torosa collected at Dievengat in northern Belgium by Carlo Heip in 1968-72. Hence, we were able to link the Mg/Ca of fossil valves of C. torosa recovered for a 28 kyr sequence at La Draga, cored on the fringe of Lake Banyoles, with the ontogenic observations of Heip, and reconstruct mean summer temperatures as well as optimal calcification temperature for C. torosa. Principal findings are: (1) the Holocene registered the highest temperatures with also very broad fluctuations; (2) three cold phases are clearly identified at 26.7-23.2, 21.6-20.3 and 16.2-14.3 ka BP; and (3) a prolonged warm phase that lasted about two millennia commenced at 19.5 ka BP and was followed by a progressive temperature decline well over three millennia. Surprisingly the Last Glacial Maximum was not the coldest phase. We finally compare our results with sea-surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from cores from the western Mediterranean Sea. Our record from La Draga clearly matches events recorded in the Alboran Sea that display SST changes obtained from the U-37(K') index. The Heinrich 1 and 2 events around 16 and 28 ka BP coincide with significant low temperature excursions at Banyoles, and palynological records in the marine cores which define semi-arid conditions on land match the low temperature record in our core.																			0262-821X					JAN	2017	36		1				50	56		10.1144/jmpaleo2015-009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/jmpaleo2015-009													WOS:000393679500009

Phytoplankton Diversity, Abundance and Toxin Synthesis Potential in the Lakes of Natural and Urban Landscapes in Permafrost Conditions	LAND												The region of Eastern Siberia that we have been studying is situated in Yakutia in the permafrost area. We studied five lakes of various geneses, located both in the urbanized territory of Yakutsk city and its suburbs and in natural landscapes at a distance from the impacted area. All lakes were found to have high levels of ammonium nitrogen, total phosphorus and total iron. The lakes' plankton was found to contain 92 species of algae and cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria in most lakes accounted for 53 to 98% of the biomass. In one of the natural lakes, 95% of the total biomass was Dinoflagellata. Bioindication, statistics and ecological mapping methods revealed correlations between cyanobacterial production intensity, landscape runoff and lake trophic state. Potentially toxic cyanobacteria containing microcystin and saxitoxin synthesis genes were found in four lakes. Our previous studies established that cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (CyanoHABs) with microcystin production are characteristic only for lakes in urbanized areas that experience the input of nutrients and organic matter due to anthropogenic runoff. This study indicates that CyanoHABs are possible in lakes in natural areas that are permafrost-dune-type lakes according to their genesis. For the first time in the region, potentially toxic cyanobacteria with saxitoxin synthesis genes have been found. Dune-type lakes do not freeze to the bottom during winter due to taliks underneath them, which provides advantages for cyanobacteria vegetation. Dune-type lakes are very common in the permafrost area, so the extent of CyanoHAB's distribution in this region may be underestimated.

Downriver Passage of Juvenile Blueback Herring near an Ultrasonic Field in the Mohawk River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												At the Crescent Hydroelectric Project (Crescent), New York, the Mohawk River is impounded by two dams separated by an island, which creates two channels; the turbine channel conveys water to the hydroelectric turbines, and the main channel conveys water around the turbines. Our objective was to determine whether ultrasound could be used to divert juvenile blueback herring Alosa aestivalis from entering the turbine channel during their fall downriver migration. Fixed-location hydroacoustics (420 kHz) was used to continuously monitor fish passage in the main channel upriver and downriver of the 122-128-kHz ultrasonic projectors. A relative index of abundance was derived from echo integration of acoustic backscatter collected from three horizontally aimed single-beam transducers sampling across each channel, while the proportion and speed of fish moving downriver were estimated from upward-facing split-beam transducers. The presence of juvenile blueback herring was verified by castnetting. Fish migrated downriver episodically for periods of hours rather than days. The mean daily number of downstream migrants (N-d) in the main channel was estimated to be 4.2 times higher at the upriver site than at the downriver site. The estimate for Nd at the main-channel downriver site (N-DM) was compared with the expected N-d (N-EDM) based on the proportion of total river flow moving through the main-channel downriver site as measured by acoustic Doppler current profilers. The mean daily difference between N-DM and N-EDM was significantly different from zero. The estimated proportion of fish that passed the main-channel downriver site (31.3%) was almost three times greater than the proportion expected (11.5%). If it is valid to assume that water flow directly influences entrainment and impingement, then the significantly higher-than-expected number of blueback herring that migrated downriver in the main channel could be an indication that ultrasound at Crescent was partially effective in diverting fish.																			0275-5947						2012	32	2					365	380		10.1080/02755947.2012.678561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.678561													WOS:000303601100017

Over 900 oxygen isotopic measurements providing information on shifts in monsoon precipitation are combined with a chronology from 45 precise Th-230 dates. delta O-18 and therefore Asian monsoon intensity generally follows changes in insolation, although changes in delta O-18 are generally accommodated in abrupt shifts in contrast to smoothly varying insolation, indicating that threshold effects may be important. delta O-18 decreased dramatically (similar to 3 parts per thousand) at the start of the Holocene (similar to 11.5 ka) and remained low for similar to 6 ka. Four positive delta O-18 events centered at 11225 +/- 97 yr BP (1.05%o), 10980 +/- 117 yr BP (1.15 parts per thousand), 9165 +/- 75 yr BP (1.4 parts per thousand), and a double event centered at 8260 +/- 64 yr BP (1.1 parts per thousand) and 8080 +/- 74 yr BP (1.0 parts per thousand) punctuated this period of high monsoon intensity. All four events correlate within error with climate changes in Greenland ice cores. Thus, the relationship between the Asian monsoon and the North Atlantic observed during the glacial period appears to continue into the early Holocene. In addition, three of the four events correlate within error with outburst events from Lake Agassiz. The decline of monsoon intensity in the mid-late Holocene is characterized by an abrupt positive shift in delta O-18 which occurs at 35505 +/- 9 yr BP (1.1 parts per thousand in similar to 100 yr). In addition, the Holocene is punctuated by numerous centennial- and multi-decadal-scale events (amplitudes 0.5 to 1 parts per thousand) up to half the amplitude of the glacial interstadial events seen in the last glacial period. Thus, Holocene centennial- and multi-decadal-scale monsoon variability is significant, although not as large as glacial millennial-scale variability. The monsoon shows a strong connection with northern South American hydrological changes related by changes in ITCZ position. Spectral analysis of the delta O-18 record shows significant peaks at solar periodicities of 208 yr and 86 yr suggesting variation is influenced by solar forcing. However, there are numerous other significant peaks including peaks at El Ni (n) over capo frequencies (observed for high-resolution portions of the record between 8110 and 8250 yr) which suggest that changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns in addition to those forced by solar changes are important in controlling Holocene monsoon climate.

Total epilimnetic phosphorus (TP), its distribution among five size-classes of dissolved (< 0.2 .mu.m) and particulate phosphorus (PP 0.2-1, 1-20, 20-200 and > 200 .mu.m), phosphate turnover time, water clarity (Secchi depth) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) were measured for two summers in eight large enclosures where plantivorous fish (1 + yellow perch) and nutrients (N and P) were added in a 2 .times. 2 factorial design. These parameters were also measured in two meso-eutrophic kettle lakes, Lake St George and Haynes Lake, [Ontario, Canada], containing low and high abundances of planktivorous fish, one of which was the lake (Lake St George) containing the enclosures. Comparable data were also collected from three oligo-mesotrophic lakes in central Ontario. In both the enclosures and the lakes, intense planktivorous fish predation was associated with increased TP, decreased abundance of larger zooplankton and mesoplanktonic PP (> 200 .mu.m), increased pico- and nanoplanktonic PP (1-20 .mu.m), increased phosphate limitation (faster turnover time), increased chlorophyll a and reduced water clarity. Slope parameter, an index of plankton size-spectrum, was correlated with phosphate turnover time and Secchi depth among enclosures, and the data from all five lakes conformed to these empirical relationships. Fertilization of enclosures produced increased variability in the relationship among the variables. Our 2 years of experiments produced qualitatively similar treatment effects, but the magnitude of the effects was not similar for all parameters. We suggest that the responses of plankton communities and associated parameters to planktivore predation that we observed in large experimental enclosures are basically similar to those in the lakes we studied, and that enclosures are an important tool in understanding complex interactions in aquatic systems.

J	Yavitt, JB; Fahey, TJ				Yavitt, JB; Fahey, TJ			Peat and solution chemistry responses to CaCO3 application in wetlands next to Woods Lake, New York	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied the effect of a calcite (CaCO3) treatment on peat and pore water chemistry in poor fen and conifer swamp wetlands next to Woods Lake and its tributaries to evaluate the role of wetlands in an Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS). Feat was characteristically organic rich and nutrient poor, with exchangeable Ca concentrations of <13 cmol(c)kg(-1) We estimated that between 0.4 to 4 Mg CaCO3 ha(-1) fell directly on three study sites; however, one year after the treatment the increase in Ca concentration (0-8 cm depth) was equivalent to a CaCO3 dosage of 3 Mg ha(-1) with an additional 2-4 Mg ha(-1) of undissolved CaCO3 still present, suggesting the pear retained Ca supplied from uplands. Most aspects of peat chemistry including microbial respiration and SO4 reduction did not respond to the treatment. Peat pore water (5 and 20 cm depths) had a mean pH of 4.82 before treatment with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOG mean of 790 mu mol C/l) and low Ca2+ concentration (mean of 32 mu mol/l). The CaCO3 treatment increased concentrations of Ca2+ to a mean of 87 mu mol/l and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) from 205 to a mean of 411 mu mol/l, whereas it decreased monomeric Al concentration from 19 to 10 mu mol/l. Otherwise, pore water chemistry showed little response to the treatment, at least within natural spatial and temporal variation of solute concentrations. The results suggest that liming watersheds with the relatively low CaCO3 dosage applied in this study can benefit acidic waters downstream by exporting more Ca and DIC and less monomeric Al, with otherwise little effect on the pear itself.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	1996	32	3					245	263		10.1007/BF02187141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02187141													WOS:A1996UT83000005

The Landsat system of instruments are land observing satellites intended for long-term studies of the earth. Landsat 5 has been in use since 1984 and is still active. Until recently there has not been a rigorous study of the performance of its thermal band. The users of this thermal data had been using the data without knowing the status of the instrument. Over the years the instrument has had the potential to drift in calibration, especially since the instrument has surpassed its expected lifetime. In fact, when Landsat 7 was launched in 1999 there had not been a systematic check of thermal calibration of Landsat 5 since shortly after its launch. Taking advantage of the fact that the two sensors, Landsat 5 and 7, were simultaneously operational, a cross-calibration was possible. As Landsat 7 maneuvered into its orbit, it passed under Landsat 5's path resulting in both sensors having common spatial and temporal coverage. Using this common data the calibration of Landsat 5 was shown to be within measurement error. A historical calibration was also performed on Landsat 5's thermal band. This was done using various Landsat 5 images of the Great Lakes from when it was launched in 1984 to 1999. Early spring images of the Great Lakes were used because of the thermal bar phenomena that occurs. The thermal bar creates a boundary of known temperature with-in the center of the lake. This known temperature boundary is used as a calibration reference. This historical calibration revealed that Landsat 5's thermal band has been operating nominally, within the uncertainties of this approach, over its lifetime. Further research will be done to refine this study of the historical behavior of the thermal band using more precise temperature measurements taken within the Great Lakes over the years.

Cloud computing-based freshwater ice mapping using synthetic aperture radar imagery	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												In regions where ice coverage significantly impacts local economies and daily life, the continuous mapping of ice types is indispensable. This study focuses on developing an automated methodology for monitoring freshwater ice, which is crucial for ensuring the safety of winter activities and transportation. The proposed processing workflow integrates cloud computing capabilities utilizing services from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Colab, along with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the open Sentinel-1 collection. Despite GEE's extensive remote sensing capabilities, it lacks built-in support for Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture calculations. Our approach addresses this gap by incorporating GLCM data analysis and clustering techniques into the GEE workflow. The methodology employs Sentinel-1 backscatter information and GLCM texture analysis within the GEE Python API framework to enhance the ice condition monitoring. A key component of this approach is the separability analysis, which identifies the most effective GLCM parameters for distinguishing different types of ice. The classification of freshwater ice types using Sentinel-1 C-band VV backscattering and GLCM texture features provided valuable insights into the challenges of ice classification.

Methane and carbon dioxide emission from an urban lake in India. Lake Reserv Manage. XXX-XXX.Lake Lakshmi, a shallow freshwater lake at the heart of Jhansi City in Uttar Pradesh (India), receives domestic sewage from the residential areas in the urban catchment. The inflowed ex situ organic wastes and the in situ produced photosynthetic substrate in the lake contribute to anaerobic conditions, generating methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), the 2 most important greenhouse gases. The rates of CH4 and CO2 emission from the lake ranged between 0.4 and 28.5 mmol CH4/m2/d and 1.1 and 30.3 mmol CO2/m2/d, respectively. The respective emission rates from the lake periphery, mid-lake, and drainage inlets during pre-monsoon months were 21.4 +/- 3.6, 16.9 +/- 3.4, and 16.0 +/- 2.8 mmol CH4/m2/d, and 18.9 +/- 4.3, 13.7 +/- 3.7, and 12.9 +/- 2.7 mmol CO2/m2/d, respectively. The average molar ratios of CO2 to CH4 increased from 0.8 during pre-monsoon to 4.3 during winter. The mean gas flux through ebullition from the lake sediment was 8.9 +/- 4.9 CH4 mmol/m2/d and 8.0 +/- 3.6 CO2 mmol/m2/d. The average molar ratios of CO2 to CH4 in the gas ebullition ranged between 0.7 and 1.4. The temperature dependence of CO2 flux was strong, with a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.598), but was stronger for CH4 flux, with a significant (R2 = 0.717) positive correlation.					; Khoiyangbam, R S/ABE-7358-2021	RS, Khoiyangbam/0000-0002-6508-8782; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				APR 3	2025	41	2					93	103		10.1080/10402381.2025.2484688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2025.2484688		APR 2025											WOS:001479167800001

Besides water discharge and water supply, the lakes and canals have ecological, shipping, fishery, recreation, sand supply, and drinking water supply functions. The water systems have target water levels based on safety, agricultural use and shipping. Because of climate change, sea level rise and ground level settling processes, it is expected that in the future the water level will rise in these areas causing safety problems in winter. This and the fact that even today it is hard to maintain target water levels, are reasons for the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management to develop strategies for future water quantity management in the northern part of The Netherlands. These strategies should be sustainable and resistant to future developments. The strategies are being developed in conjunction with the parties concerned and should (therefore) have the support of the majority of organizations (NGOs) making use of the IJsselmeer region and the canals. To achieve this goal one of the tools being used is a collaborative planning process. All the organizations making use of the IJsselmeer region and/or canals are involved in the process of creating water management strategies together. In four phases, three water management strategies and a most promising strategy for the long term (a combination of two strategies) were drawn up over a period of about three years. A final government decision was made at the end of the year 2000.																			0144-7815		1-901502-71-6				2001		272					51	56																WOS:000177182900008

The vegetation formed three distinct zones along the water table gradient, two dominated by emergent aquatic macrophytes (the Phragmites australis-dominated zone and the Juncus yokoscensis-dominated zone) and one dominated by terrestrial macrophytes (Miscanthus sinensis and Cirsium inundatum-dominated zone). To clarify the impact of variations in water table on monthly and yearly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes, we examined the relationship between water table and the ratio of observed flux to calculated flux, whereby the calculated flux was based solely on the exponential relationship between flux and soil temperature for each gas. This study revealed that the impact of variations in water table on monthly and yearly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes differed markedly between the vegetation zones. By taking the temporal change in water table into account in the estimation of both the CO2 and CH4 fluxes, the monthly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Phragmites-zone were markedly greater in every month of the year compared to estimation based on temperature alone. In the Juncus-zone, the effect of water table on monthly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes differed between months. In addition, the magnitude of water-table effects controlling monthly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes differed with atmospheric conditions. i.e.. between the pressure-falling and low-pressure phase on the one hand and other pressure phases on the other hand. After weighting all the impacts of temporal changes in water table on fluxes, the yearly summed CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed a 1.26-6.64-fold increase compared with not taking water table effects into account, and the increase differed among the three vegetation zones.

Temporal and spatial dynamics of harmful algal bloom-associated microbial communities in eutrophic Clear Lake, California	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Clear Lake is a large, natural eutrophic lake located in northern California, United States. Persistent, toxic cyanobacterial blooms have been reported in the lake since 2011. However, our understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of toxin-producing genera and their interaction with the biotic and abiotic environment is limited. Moreover, few studies have addressed how the co-occurring microbial communities respond to these toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Using multi-domain 16S/18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, a strong seasonal succession within the cyanobacterial and co-occurring eukaryotic assemblage was identified, which was primarily explained by variation in total phosphorus (similar to 30%, P < 0.001) and temperature (similar to 15%, P < 0.01). Cyanobacterial seasonal succession was often initiated by proliferation of diazotrophs (Dolichospermum and Nodularia) with concomitant increases in total nitrogen, followed by blooms of non-diazotrophs, such as Microcystis, Limnothrix, and Planktothrix. The picocyanobacterium Cyanobium, previously undocumented in the lake, was a dominant summer taxon in the western part of Clear Lake, accounting for similar to 45%-80% relative abundance of the cyanobacterial reads. Seasonal succession within the eukaryotic assemblage was influenced by photosynthetic chlorophytes and diatoms, as well as mixotrophic ciliates and cryptophytes. Among all toxin-producing cyanobacterial genera, Microcystis abundance was most strongly correlated with microcystin concentrations (P < 0.001), both of which appeared to influence co-occurring eukaryotes. Finally, using putative relationships based on correlation of sequence abundance and environmental variables, several potential grazers of Microcystis were identified, including cyclopoid copepods and Cryptomonas. These correlations need further confirmation and experimental work to validate the nature of the relationships. IMPORTANCE Clear Lake is an important habitat for fish and wildlife, which also provides a myriad of human benefits, such as recreation, irrigation, and drinking water. Moreover, the lake is vital for tribal tradition and cultural practices. However, since the last decade, the lake has experienced recurring harmful algal blooms with toxin levels that frequently exceed California voluntary guidance levels. These high toxin concentrations pose a substantial threat to the residents, visitors, and tribal sustenance fishing and beneficial uses. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of these toxic algal bloom dynamics and their interaction with the abiotic and biotic environments. This study characterized the seasonal and spatial patterns in the distribution of bloom-causing cyanobacteria and identified Microcystis as the major toxin producer in Clear Lake. Additionally, the co-occurring bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities were also characterized, and their potential interactions with the cyanobacterial assemblage were identified and discussed.

Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain MINF-07-Sa-05T consistently fell within the genus Nitrincola and formed a clade together with Nitrincola alkalilacustris ZV-19T (98.97%) and Nitrincola lacisaponensis 4CAT (96.16%). Genomic average nucleotide identity values for strain MINF-07-Sa-05T with the type strains within the genus Nitrincola ranged from 69.8 to 87.8%, while the in silico DNA-DNA hybridization values for strain MINF-07-Sa-05T with these strains ranged from 20.4 to 33.7%. The genome sequence size of the strain was 4.81 Mb, with a DNA G+C content of 52.6 mol%. Its growth occurred at 4-40 degrees C, at pH 6.0-10.0, and tolerated up to 9% (w/v) NaCl. The major fatty acids contained summed feature 8 (C18:1 w7c/C18:1 w6c; 59.8%), summed feature 3 (C16:1 w7c/C16:1 w6c; 20.4%) and C16:0 (13.8%). The primary respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-8. The main polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Genomic analyses showed a high abundance of genes involved in the nitrogen, sulphur cycle and antibiotic resistance. According to the genotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data, strain MINF-07-Sa-05T represents a novel species within the genus Nitrincola, for which the name Nitrincola salilacus sp. nov. is proposed.

J	Pablo, MJ; Rosales, YO				Pablo, Milana Juan; Rosales, Yanira Olivares			The annual retreat of the tropical Tarija Glacier (Bolivia), suggesting warming may not be related to atmospheric CO2 increase	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												We present here the longest known continuous annual moraine record extending from the XVIII century to the present, which portrays a very irregular retreat history of the tropical Tarija Glacier, in the Bolivian Andes. This study also proves for the first time in South America, the annual formation on these minor moraines, while field observations showed how these ridges form, substantiating the presented 258 year-long glacial retreat history. The annual retreat record is validated by correlation with Lake Titicaca surface level evolution: the highest ablation rate matches the highest lake level (1986-1987 yr). The glacial retreat also fits well with a large Pampean foreland lake level evolution (Mar Chiquita), suggesting this glacier reflects continental-scale climate trends. There is, however, no correlation with CO2 concentration curves. The glacier retreat suggest there were at least seven events of warming that lasted one to two decades, and none of these had any correlation to the greenhose gasses evolution. Besides, glacier retreat slowed down over the last three decades, in coincidence with the tendency of large lakes to a level fall, suggesting warming rate would also slow down. The departure of the glacial retreat chronology that worldwide is considered to be related to warming, from the CO2 evolution over the last three centuries, suggests CO2 does not contribute a primary effect on warming, as most models assume. Given some coincidences, we suggest climate shifts causing the irregular retreat of the Tarija Glacier, may be related to a delayed effect of solar irradiance indicating that the relation between solar irradiance and its impact on Earth's surface systems needs to be better understood for a critical examination of the climate change paradigm.

However, silt- and clay-rich valley-fill deposits, incised by present streams, occur as terraces and terrace remnants. Such deposits are not accumulating today. In and upstream of Brachina Gorge, in the central ranges. these remnant valley-fills are exposed in bank sections up to 18 m high. At some localities, exposures show horizontal. centimetre-scale beds of fine sand and clayey silt that can be traced for several hundred metres, and contain gastropods, diatoms and phytoliths consistent with sluggish, shallow water flow under fresh to brackish conditions. AMS C-14 and OSL dating shows that these valley-fill deposits accumulated between similar to 33 and 17 ka, an interval that embraces the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Formerly thought to be take beds (Aust. J. Earth Sci. 46 (1999) 61), the valley fills are shown here to have accumulated in a fluvial wetland that extended westward from the middle reaches of Brachina Creek., through Brachina Gorge and joined with aggraded fan deposits beyond the ranges. Aggradation of this wetland requires a substantial reduction or both rainfall variability and evaporation. which would be favoured by the low temperatures and reduced incursions of summer rainfall. This is consistent with climatic reconstructions by Miller et al. (Nature 385 (1997) 241) and Johnson et al, (Science 284 (1999) 1150) for Lake Eyre, north of the Flinders Ranges. at the LGM. Demise of the wetland was heralded by a major influx of coarse alluvium followed by channelling and dissection. Erosion was interrupted by an episode of aggradation and floodplain widening, represented by remnants of a wide terrace inset below the primary wetland surface. This episode, which is interpreted as a return to lower climatic variability. ceased with establishment of the present climatic regime. which has resulted in stripping of the Late Pleistocene deposits front much of the Brachina valley.

J	Pilas, I; Planinsek, S				Pilas, Ivan; Planinsek, Spela			THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WATER REGIME IN LOWLAND FORESTS IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT	SUMARSKI LIST												Amongst the existing forest types in Europe, the specific biological function of water is nowhere more distinctive than in the lowland forest ecosystems. Consequently no existing forest types are more shaped by historic hydrologic conditions, altered by manmade deviations from the natural water regime and vulnerable to consequences of global warming. The lowermost parts of the lowland forests, the wetlands, present the transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems i.e. ponds, lakes, streams and rivers. Nowadays, due to excessive urbanization and the spread of agriculture, the total area of lowland forests and wetlands has been significantly reduced. One of the largest complexes of alluvial floodplain wetlands and lowland forests in Europe are situated in the South-East Europe, in the Sava and Drava River basins, tributaries to the Danube River The Sava River is a unique example of a river where the floodplains are still intact, supporting both flood alleviation and biodiversity. Continental lowland forests in Croatia cover an area of more than 200.000 ha with a significant role in forestry production, flood reduction, recharging groundwater reserves, as well as filtering pollutants. The natural forest vegetation consists of mainly hardwood tree species such as the common oak (Quercus robur L.), field ash (Fraxinus excelsior Vahl.), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and softwood species such as black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.), poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.). For the biological diversity of lowland forests and attached wetlands is strongly important specific combination of hydrology and soils. The development of these forests in history was determined by regular seasonal alternations of groundwater tables (hydro period) and periodic flooding. This paper presents the possibilities for the re-establishment of the water regime of lowland forests as one option to reduce the impact of climate change in the future. To reduce negative impacts of anthropogenic alternations in the groundwater regime from the past and to attenuate slow down future very possible prolongation of droughts and water scarcity in the lowlands, various forest managerial and engineering practices could be considered. Basically, there are potentially two main contrasted measures of soil water balance manipulation: drainage of soils (through drainage ditches and channels) which contribute to decreasing the groundwater tables and forest management i.e. (tendering and thinning) which contribute to increased soil water content and increase in the groundwater level. Through these water table management practices, the amount of soil water required for the survival of lowland forests could be maintained to some degree to attenuate the negative hydrologic trends and natural hazards such as droughts. The comprehensive methodological review of activities that must precede such reconstruction activities are presented. As the initial segment all the major components of floodplain ecosystems - the morphology of the terrain, hydrography, soils stratigraphy, vegetation and anthropogenic influences - should be assessed. As a next step methodological options towards how to obtain the knowledge of the natural water regime prior anthropogenic hydrotechnical activities which caused the creation of the ecosystem in its current form are presented. For this purpose the morphology of hydromorphic soils i.e. relict indicators of natural water regime in lowland habitats are assessed. The next step includes the spatial determination of critical areas orhot spots, threatened by excessive falls in the groundwater level on which specific measures can be applied to return to natural water regime conditions (i.e. water retention in dry riverbeds).

Geomorphology and 10Be chronology of the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation in northeastern Patagonia, 43°S-71°W	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In southern South America, well-dated glacial geomorphological records constrain the last glacial cycle across much of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet, but its northeastern sector remains comparatively understudied and unconstrained. This knowledge gap inhibits our understanding of the timing of maximum glacier extent, the duration of the glacial maximum, the onset of deglaciation, and whether asynchronies exist in the behaviour of the former ice sheet with latitude, or with location (east or west) relative to the ice divide. Robust glacial reconstructions from this region are thus required to comprehend the mechanisms driving Quaternary glaciations at the southern mid-latitudes. We here present Be-10 surface exposure ages from five moraine sets along with Bayesian age modelling to reconstruct a detailed chronology of Last Glacial Maximum expansions of the Rio Corcovado glacier, a major former ice conduit of northern Patagonia. We find that the outlet glacier reached maximum expansion of the last glacial cycle during the global Last Glacial Maximum at similar to 26.5-26 ka, and that at least four subsequent advances/stillstands occurred over a 2e3 ka period, at similar to 22.5e22 ka, similar to 22-21.5 ka, similar to 21-20.5 ka and 20-19.5 ka. The onset of local ice sheet deglaciation likely occurred between 20 and 19 ka. Contrary to several other Patagonian outlet glaciers, including from similar latitudes on the western side of the Andes, we find no evidence for MIS 3/4 advances. Exposure dating of palaeo-shoreline cobbles reconstructing the timing of proglacial lake formation and drainage shifts in the studied region indicate three glaciolacustrine phases characterised by Atlantic-directed drainage. Phase one occurred from 26.4 +/- 1.4 ka, phase two between similar to 21 and similar to 19 ka and phase three between similar to 19 ka and similar to 16.3 ka. Exposure dating of icemoulded bedrock in the interior of the cordillera indicates local disintegration of the Patagonian Ice Sheet and the Atlantic-Pacific drainage reversal had occurred by similar to 16.3 ka. We find that local Last Glacial Maximum glacier expansions were coeval with Antarctic and southern mid-latitude atmospheric and oceanic cooling signals, but out of phase with local summer insolation intensity. Our results indicate that local Patagonian Ice Sheet deglaciation occurred 1-2 ka earlier than northwestern, central eastern and southeastern Patagonian outlet glaciers, which could indicate high regional Patagonian Ice Sheet sensitivity to warming and drying during the Varas interstade (similar to 22.5-19.5 ka).

J	Pace, RM III; Afton, AD				Pace, RM III; Afton, AD			Direct recovery rates of lesser scaup banded in northwest Minnesota: Sources of heterogeneity	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Heterogeneity in direct recovery rates is an important area of study because deductions about survival rates and hunting mortality are made from recovery data. We tested the hypothesis of condition bias in hunter-killed lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and tested differences among direct recovery rates ((f) over cap = proportion of birds banded that are killed by a hunter less than or equal to 3 months after release and reported) of scaup staging on Thief Lake Wildlife Management Area (TLWMA) and Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northwestern Minnesota. Scaup were trapped, held for 24 hr, weighed, banded with standard aluminum leg bands, and released during 4 October-8 November 1983-86 at TLWMA, and 1984-86 at ANWR. During 1984-86, we also sprayed areas of white plumage with fluorescent paint, colorcoded by age and location. Recovery data obtained from cooperative hunters and the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory were subjected to 3 sets of analyses. In an analysis of variance (ANOVA), after adjusting for sex, age, year, location of capture, and date of capture, body mass at capture of recovered birds was lower, on average, than those not recovered. Logistic regression indicated (1) probability of recovering a bird decreased with increasing body mass; (2) within years, probability of recovery increased with date of first capture; (3) scaup at TLWMA were recovered at greater rates than scaup at ANWR; (4) hatching-year (HY) scaup were recovered at greater rates than were after-hatching-year (AHY) birds; and (5) recovery was more likely during 1984-86 than in 1983. Finally, in a crude test of recovery distribution, recoveries of birds banded at ANWR were about half as likely as those banded on TLWMA to occur in Minnesota. We conclude that cohort membership (age, capture site) and condition, as measured by body mass, influence susceptibility to hunting mortality. These and other sources of heterogeneity in recovery rates should be considered when modeling survival of scaup.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JAN	1999	63	1					389	395		10.2307/3802524	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802524													WOS:000078199400043
J	Frezzotti, M; Orombelli, G				Frezzotti, Massimo; Orombelli, Giuseppe			Glaciers and ice sheets: current status and trends	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												About 10 % of the land surface on Earth is covered by glacier ice, with an estimated total volume equivalent to about 66 m of potential sea-level rise. Almost the totality (99 %) of this volume is locked in the polar ice sheets, while less than 1 % forms all the other mountain glaciers and ice caps. In the last three decades, the general retreat of the mountain glaciers and the accelerated flow and ice loss from several outlet glaciers draining the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets came to general attention as a major evidence of climate warming and as a potential contribution to the sea-level rise, to local shortage of water resources and to other environmental risks. Here, we present a short review of the most recent data and assessments on the present status and on trends of glaciers and polar ice sheets. The Greenland ice sheet (12 % of total glacier ice volume) over the last three decades showed an increase of the extent of the surface melt area and an acceleration of many marine-terminating glaciers; as a consequence, the ice sheet is losing ice at an increasing rate that reached -263 +/- A 30 Gt/year in the 2005-2010 time interval, equivalent to a sea-level rise of 0.72 +/- A 0.08 mm/year. The much larger, higher and colder composite Antarctic ice sheet (87 % of total glacier ice volume), in the same 2005-2010 time interval, had an ice loss of -81 +/- A 37 Gt/year. Mountain glaciers and ice caps are retreating in all the major glacierized regions, with the exception of a few mountain areas where contrasting patterns have been observed. Although containing less than 1 % of the total glacier ice, mountain glaciers and ice caps suffered a total ice loss of -259 +/- A 28 Gt/year in the period 2003-2009, equivalent to a sea-level rise of 0.71 +/- A 0.08 mm/year. The overall contribution of glaciers and ice sheets is estimated equivalent to a sea-level rise of 1.50 +/- A 0.16 mm/year for the period 2003-2009, or about 60 % of the total sea-level rise in the same period. Various estimates of the total glacier contribution to the sea-level rise by the end of the twenty-first century have been recently proposed, ranging from a few decimeters to 2 m, with most plausible projections at about 0.5 m. Most probably Greenland, the Antarctic Peninsula and the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue to lose ice, while the sign of the East Antarctica contribution is uncertain. Mountain glaciers will most likely continue to lose ice, although at different rates in the various mountain regions. For the European Alps and the Southern Alps (New Zealand), a loss of more than 70 % of their present volume is expected by the end of the twenty-first century. The glaciers' contraction in the mountain areas may cause slope failures, debris mobilization, outburst floods from glacial lakes, and water deficits, particularly in the summer season, in the arid zones in the coming decades. Together with other changes occurring in the cryosphere such as the Arctic sea-ice reduction, the snow cover decline and the permafrost degradation, the glacier retreat is considered part of a larger picture of environmental changes, directly or indirectly caused or increased by the human impact, leading to new environmental conditions, thus deserving to be indicated as the Anthropocene. Still more open to future responses is the consideration if the ongoing glacier reduction and the rise of the sea level will contribute to leave such a footprint in the geologic record as to require a new stratigraphic unit, a new time epoch in the billion years long history of the Earth.

J	Soroush, F; Ehteram, M; Seifi, A				Soroush, Fatemeh; Ehteram, Mohammad; Seifi, Akram			Uncertainty and spatial analysis in wheat yield prediction based on robust inclusive multiple models	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Reliable prediction of wheat yield ahead of harvest is a critical challenge for decision-makers along the supply chain. Predicting wheat yield is a real challenge for better agriculture and food security management. Modeling wheat yield is complex and challenging, so robust tools are needed. The main aim of this study is to predict wheat yield using an advanced ensemble model. A multilayer perceptron model (MLP) was combined with optimization algorithms to determine MLP parameters as the first step in the study. Several optimization algorithms were used as optimizers, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Honey Badger Algorithms (HBA), Sine-Cosine Algorithms (SCA), and Shark Algorithms (SA). Meteorological data were inserted into models. Next, the outputs of optimized MLP models were incorporated into an inclusive multiple MLP model (IMM). A new hybrid gamma test was used to determine the most appropriate input combination. A hybrid gamma test was created by coupling the HBA with GT. This paper introduces a robust IMM model, develops an MLP model using optimization algorithms, develops a new hybrid gamma test, uses Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to analyze uncertainty, and presents a spatial map of wheat yield prediction. Based on the Gamma Test analysis, mean air temperature (T-a), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), evapotranspiration (ET), and precipitation (P) were the most important input parameters for reliable and accurate winter wheat yield predictions. At the testing level, the IMM model decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the MLP-HBA, MLP-SCA, MLP-SA, MLP-PSO, and MLP models by 47%, 52%, 55%, 58%, and 61%, respectively. In the study, the uncertainty of models based on input data was significantly lower than that of the model parameters. In addition, the GLUE analysis revealed that the wheat yield predictions were more stable and confident by considering the ensemble IMM technique. The pattern of root mean square error (RMSE) maps demonstrated that higher error produces in the northeast of Urmia Lake. The developed framework provides insight into rainfed yield responses to weather conditions and is simple and inexpensive. Accurate and reliable wheat yield prediction is essential for agricultural monitoring and food policy analysis.

J	Reche, I; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ				Reche, I; Pace, ML; Cole, JJ			Modeled effects of dissolved organic carbon and solar spectra on photobleaching in lake ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contains molecules that absorb light at various wavelengths. This chromophoric DOM (CDOM) influences the transmission of both visible and ultraviolet energy through water. The absorption of light by CDOM often causes structural changes that reduce its capacity to further absorb light, a process termed 'photobleaching'. A model was designed to assess photobleaching through the entire water column of lake ecosystems. The model uses lake morphometry and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in conjunction with a defined solar spectrum and experimentally measured photobleaching rates to compute the total water columm photobleaching. The model was initially applied to a theoretical 'average' lake using solar spectra for both the north (N) and south (S) temperate western hemispheres and variable DOC from 0.3 to 30 mg L-1. The consequences of varying waveband-specific photobleaching coefficients and lake morphometry were explored in a second set of simulations. Finally, the model was also applied to four temperate northern lakes for which we had prior measurements of CDOM photobleaching rates. The model demonstrates that all three wavebands of solar radiation (UVB, WA, and PAR) contribute significantly to total water column photobleaching, with WA being most important. The relative contributions of the three wavebands were invariant for DOC more than 3 mg L-1. Total water column photobleaching at 440 nm was three to five times faster under the UV-enriched solar spectrum of the southern hemisphere. Increasing the lake's mean depth (from 0.37 to 9.39 m) resulted in five- or 15-fold slower rates of total water column photobleaching for DOC concentrations of 1 or 10 mg L-1, respectively. Varying the waveband-specific photobleaching coefficients by 10-fold resulted in a similar change in total water column photobleaching rates. Applying the model to four specific lakes revealed that photobleaching for the entire water column would reduce CDOM light absorption by 50% in 18-44 days under summer conditions.

However, the eco-environmental quality (EEQ) of Dongting Lake Wetland (DLW) has been largely decreased due to intensive anthropogenic and natural stressors during the past decades. Here, we calculated the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and analyzed the spatial autocorrelation of DLW from 1990 to 2020 using Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing data. We also used the Geo-detector model (GDM) to quantitatively reveal the driving factors and their interactions with EEQ. Our results showed that: (1) the RSEI values ranged between 0.45 and 0.55 indicating a medium level of EEQ. The EEQ showed a first decreasing and then fluctuating increasing trend during 1990-2020, and the spatial distribution of EEQ was general higher in the eastern while lower in the western DLW. (2) The spatial distribution of EEQ was positively correlated and exhibited a cluster pattern. The High-High cluster areas were predominantly grassland (RSEI = 0.572), while the Low-Low cluster areas were characterized by phragmites (RSEI = 0.388) and mudflats (RSEI = 0.474). (3) The interactions between internal and external factors showed synergistic effects on EEQ, with vegetation coverage (q = 0.417) and landscape pattern (q = 0.347) were the main external driving factors of EEQ. Our results imply that the priority of improving the EEQ of DLW should focus on the protection and restoration of plants especially for grassland.																			2045-2322					OCT 3	2025	15	1							34526	10.1038/s41598-025-17784-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17784-7								41044204					WOS:001587515500019

Late Quaternary inundation and desiccation of Megalake Chad traced in dust records from the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Modern Lake Chad has shrunk in area by around 90 % since the 1960s under the twin pressures of climate change and increasing water demand. During the early to mid Holocene, the Chad basin featured a megalake with an area approximately 100 times larger than its modern remnant. In the mid/late Holocene (approximately 5000 years ago), this megalake dried out leaving behind vast deposits of readily deflated fine-grained sediments that are suggested to contribute similar to 25 % of the annual total global atmospheric mineral dust load. Erosion has obliterated much of the evidence of earlier North African humid periods within the Lake Chad basin, limiting our understanding of the relationship between global/regional climatology, local hydrology and dust export. Here, we present new records of thorium-normalized flux estimates of mineral dust and its radiogenic isotope composition deposited at Ocean Drilling Program Site 662, situated downwind of Megalake Chad underneath the North African winter dust plume, in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Our records show that sediments of the Megalake Chad basin have a distinct neodymium isotopic signature that can be traced thousands of kilometers downwind from their source when the megalake basin was dry and dust-active, whereas the fingerprint of its input was strongly suppressed at times of high lake levels. Our results show that marine sedimentary archives can preserve uninterrupted proxy records of climate-driven hydrological change on the continents, in this case, a bellwether region of Africa that features the world's most active dust source, the Bodele Depression.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 15	2025	366								109503	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109503		JUL 2025											WOS:001532264200001

Traditional reed management tools at Lake Neusiedl are becoming decreasingly suitable due to insufficient freezing in winter. Therefore, prescribed burning of old Phragmites australis stands is currently being considered as a regeneration measure to promote reed regrowth and maintain invaluable habitats for specialized species in the reed belt. In January 2024 a pilot study was carried out near the municipality of Jois to gain insights into suitability and consequences of controlled burning of old reed mats in the reed belt. Applied methods include pre- and post-fire biomass and carbon content analyses from vegetation, litter and soil, fire behavior and intensity monitoring, moisture content measurements during and after the fire, and area-wide UAV-LiDAR mapping. Mean fire temperature was approx. 700 degrees C and peaked at 1034 degrees C. 15.57 ha of the 32 ha study area were affected by the fire, and a total of 57.84 tons of carbon were released (3.72 t C/ha). On burnt areas standing vegetation was removed and litter thickness significantly reduced by approx. 30%, while no biomass loss from soil was detected. Fuel moisture content is negatively correlated to distance from the water table and has mitigating effects on fire spread if above 30%, resulting in unaffected deeper layers and numerous unburnt refugia patches within the fire perimeter. Our results indicate that prescribed fire can be a suitable management tool at Lake Neusiedl for the purpose of reed rejuvenation and wetland habitat regeneration.

Grand Expectations: Understanding Visitor Motivations and Outcome Interference in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION												National Park Service (NPS) units have seen a significant increase in visitation in recent years. From 2014 to 2016, Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) experienced a 17% increase in recreational visits. Managing for increased use, driven partially by new and novel types of recreation activities, is a growing issue of concern for the NPS. This study uses a qualitative approach to examine how emerging activity types paired with increased visitor use in GTNP's popular String and Leigh Lakes (SLL) area may lead to outcome interference among park visitors. An influx of novel uses, such as paddleboarding, to an area that is already popular for a myriad of recreation activities, including canoeing, picnicking, and day hiking, adds a layer of complexity to the management of the lakes. This increase in visitation and activity diversity, combined with limited vehicle access and parking, is creating an environment in which crowding and displacement of visitors is occurring. Using the recreational opportunity demand hierarchy (RODH) and an outcomes-focused management (OFM) framework, this study explores visitor activities, settings, and motivations, as well as possible outcome-interfering variables that may interfere with benefit-achievement. To inform this effort, 62 semi-structured interviews were compiled using a random-sampling technique in the SLL area during the summer of 2017. Data were analyzed using a blind coding technique and results suggest that conflict, crowding, and displacement are possible outcome-interfering variables that can be targeted in future research and monitoring efforts in the SLL area and beyond. The results also indicate that visitors react rationally to previous recreational outcomes. Additionally, we examine how our results can address common critiques of OFM. Finally, we propose a new iteration of the RODH, the rational recreation demand hierarchy (RRDH), in which outcomes direct future recreational decisions. The findings of this study and the updated outcomes-focused framework provide a variety of implications to managers. These include the management of outcomes and outcome-interfering variables as indicators of quality, a means of conceptualizing how outcome-achievement influences future decision-making concerning recreational activities and settings, and the treatment of protected area visitors as rational decision makers. Additionally, this study provides a vignette of how increased visitation, a phenomenon widely reported across US national parks, influences visitor experience.

Controls on the epilimnetic phosphorus concentration in small temperate lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Phosphorus (P) is one of the key limiting nutrients for algal growth in most fresh surface waters. Understanding the determinants of P accumulation in the water column of lakes of interest, and the prediction of its concentration is important to water quality managers and other stakeholders. We hypothesized that lake physicochemical, climate, and watershed land-use attributes control lake P concentration. We collected relevant data from 126 lakes in Maine, USA, to determine the major drivers for summer total epilimnetic P concentrations. Predictive regression-based models featured lake external and internal drivers. The most important land-use driver was the extent of agriculture in the watershed. Lake average depth was the most important physical driver, with shallow lakes being most susceptible to high P concentrations; shallow lakes often stratify weakly and are most subject to internal mixing. The sediment NaOH-extracted aluminum (Al) to bicarbonate/dithionite-extracted P molar ratio was the most important sediment chemical driver; lakes with a high hypolimnetic P release have low ratios. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was an important water column chemical driver; lakes having a high DOC concentration generally had higher epilimnetic P concentrations. Precipitation and temperature, two important climate/weather variables, were not significant drivers of epilimnetic P in the predictive models. Because lake depth and sediment quality are fixed in the short-term, the modeling framework serves as a quantitative lake management tool for stakeholders to assess the vulnerability of individual lakes to watershed development, particularly agriculture. The model also enables decisions for sustainable development in the watershed and lake remediation if sediment quality is conducive to internal P release. The findings of this study may be applied to bloom metrics more directly to support lake and watershed management actions.					; Birkel, Sean/W-2504-2019	Amirbahman, Aria/0000-0003-1252-8358; Birkel, Sean/0000-0003-0287-5604; 													2050-7887	2050-7895				JAN 26	2022	24	1					89	101		10.1039/d1em00353d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00353d		DEC 2021						34904604					WOS:000729852100001

The sound-producing sand dunes we have investigated are situated along a curvilinear belt of deserts and experience variable precipitation-evaporation rates on a yearly basis. "Singing sands" occur mainly on barchan-type dunes and adjacent to lakes or springs, whereas soundless sands are mainly located in desert areas where there is no nearby surface or groundwater sources. We have analyzed samples from nine sound-producing and two soundless sand dunes using grain size, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence, and SEM analyses. All sand types are composed largely of quartz and feldspar, but sound-producing sands also contain secondary minerals such as kaolinite (3-5%), albite (2-6%), microcline (2-5%), and calcite (5%) that are lacking in the soundless sand samples. Sound-producing sands are generally fine-grained whereas soundless sands are coarse-grained, and all sand types are generally sub-rounded to rounded indicating long transport distance from their provenance. Sphericity values of both sand types are nearly identical with predominantly oblate shapes. Surface pitting is not a unique feature of either sand types, and hence can be ruled out as a major cause of the acoustic properties of sound-producing sands. Densely distributed dissolution features such as scale-like upturned plates and silica scales on grain surfaces contribute significantly to the sound emission of singing sands. Thus, the physical-climatic conditions in deserts such as the presence of surface water and groundwater and precipitation-evaporation rates, which collectively control the formation and distribution of dissolution features on sand surfaces, have a first-order control on the production of sound-producing sands.

B	Talling, J	Tundisi, JG; MatsumuraTundisi, T			Talling, Jack	Tundisi, JG; MatsumuraTundisi, T		Water as a medium	LIMNOLOGY												Water is an extremely unusual substance. It exists in three states: solid, liquid and gas. The transition from one phase to another depends on a rearrangement of the molecules and the configuration of its aggregates. The physical properties of water, especially its temperature-related anomalies in density, play a key role in the circulation and stratification processes in lakes and reservoirs, and in the vertical organization of the system in in temperate lakes in winter, when surfaces freeze. The physical and chemical properties of water, in particular its anomalies in density, surface tension and thermal features, are important to aquatic organisms inhabiting the liquid medium. Another significant biological property is that surface tension enables the existence of special forms of aquatic life. Viscosity is another important property, as the mobility of aquatic organisms in the liquid medium depends on it. The hydrologic cycle on the planet includes the components of evaporation, transport by wind, precipitation, and drainage. Driven by solar radiation and wind energy, the cycle depends on the perpetual transition from the liquid phase in the oceans to the gaseous phase in the atmosphere to precipitation over the continents. The global distribution of water is irregular. Some regions have plenty and others have shortages. The availability of liquid water depends on a reserve of inland waters, characterized by waters in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, wetlands and groundwater. The volume and quality of water in underground aquifers depend on the vegetation cover, which promotes re-charge and helps maintain water quality. Distribution of fresh water is also irregular in Brazil. Some regions have abundant resources of surface and underground waters and relatively sparse population. Other regions have relatively sparse water resources and are densely populated, such as the highly urbanized regions in the south-east. The per capita distribution of water in the country is uneven.																					978-0-203-80395-0; 978-0-415-58835-5				2011							21	35				10.1201/b11386												WOS:000364533700006
J	Gasse, F				Gasse, F			Hydrological changes in the African tropics since the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					1st PAGES Open Science Meeting	APR 19-23, 1998	UNIV LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND		UNIV LONDON			Paleohydrological data from the African tropics and subtropics, including lake, groundwater and speleothem records, are reviewed to show how environments and climates from both hemispheres are inter-related. Although orbitally induced changes in the monsoon strength account for a large part of long-term climatic changes in tropical Africa, the Late Pleistocene-Holocene hydrological fluctuations rather appear to have been a series of abrupt events that reflect complex interactions between, orbital forcing, atmosphere, ocean and land surface conditions. During the Last Glacial Maximum (23-18 ka BP), most records indicate that generally dry conditions have prevailed in both hemispheres, associated with lower tropical land- and sea-surface temperatures. This agrees with simulations using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, which predict cooling and reduced summer precipitation in tropical Africa; the global hydrological cycle was weaker than today when the extent of large polar ice-sheets and sea-ice was a prominent forcing factor of the Earth's climate. Glacial-interglacial climatic changes started early: a first wetting/warming phase at ca. 17-16 ka BP took place during a period of rapid temperature increase in Antarctica. Next, two drastic arid-humid transitions in equatorial and northern Africa occurred around 15-14.5 ka BP and 11.5-11 ka BP. Both are thought to match the major Greenland warming events, in concert with the switching of the oceanic thermohaline circulation to modern mode. However, part of the climatic signal after 15 ka BP also seems related to the Antarctica climate. During the Holocene, Africa has also experienced rapid hydrological fluctuations of dramatic magnitude compared to the climatic changes at high latitudes. In particular, major dry spells occurred around 8.4-8 ka and 4.2-4 ka BP in the northern monsoon domain. Comparison with other parts of the world indicates that these events have a worldwide distribution but different regional expressions. In the absence of large polar ice sheets, changes in the continental hydrological cycles in the tropics may have a significant impact on the global climate system. Climate information gathered here allows to identify geographical and methodological gaps, and raise some scientific questions that remain to be solved to better understand how the tropics respond to changes in major climate-forcing factors, and how they influence climate globally.

Tropical Peat and Peatland Development in the Floodplains of the Greater Pamba Basin, South-Western India during the Holocene	PLOS ONE												Holocene sequences in the humid tropical region of Kerala, South-western (SW) India have preserved abundance of organic-rich sediments in the form of peat and its rapid development in a narrow time frame towards Middle Holocene has been found to be significant. The sub-coastal areas and flood plains of the Greater Pamba Basin have provided palaeorecords of peat indicating that the deposits are essentially formed within freshwater. The combination of factors like stabilized sea level and its subsequent fall since the Middle Holocene, topographic relief and climatic conditions led to rapid peat accumulation across the coastal lowlands. The high rainfall and massive floods coupled with a rising sea level must have inundated > 75% of the coastal plain land converting it into a veritable lagoon-lake system that eventually led to abrupt termination of the forest ecosystem and also converted the floodplains into peatland where accumulation of peat almost to 2.0-3.0 m thickness in coastal lowlands and river basins during the shorter interval in the Middle Holocene. Vast areas of the coastal plains of Kerala have been converted into carbon rich peatland during the Middle Holocene and transforming the entire coastal stretch and associated landforms as one of the relatively youngest peatlands in the extreme southern tip of India. Unlike the uninterrupted formation of peatlands of considerable extent during the Holocene in Southeast Asia, the south Peninsular Indian region has restricted and short intervals of peatlands in the floodplains and coastal lowlands. Such a scenario is attributed to the topographic relief of the terrain and the prevailing hydrological regimes and environmental conditions as a consequence of monsoon variability since Middle Holocene in SW India. Considering the tropical coastal lowlands and associated peatlands are excellent repositories of carbon, they are very important for regional carbon cycling and habitat diversity. The alarming rate of land modification and development is destabilizing these carbon pools resulting in large scale carbon emissions to the atmosphere and loss of low-latitude peat palaeorecords. Therefore, these palaeorecords are to be conserved and addressed for better understanding and utilizing the carbon pool for effective climate change adaptation. This communication is the first attempt of addressing the peat formation and peatland development during the Holocene from the tropical region of Peninsular India.

J	Li, CY; Huang, W; Chen, CS; Lin, HC				Li, Chunyan; Huang, Wei; Chen, Changsheng; Lin, Huichan			Flow Regimes and Adjustment to Wind-Driven Motions in Lake Pontchartrain Estuary: A Modeling Experiment Using FVCOM	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Lake Pontchartrain is a brackish estuary and restricted lagoon in the microtidal northern Gulf of Mexico. Using a validated Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM), we study the flow regimes and wind-driven adjustment of circulation in this system. It is found that tidal currents are only significant in the eastern end near the open boundary. Local wind inside the estuary is important in driving the circulation including coastal currents. Numerical experiments confirm that the subtidal wind-driven flow is in a quasi-steady balance between wind stress and surface slope. Our results show that the adjustment of surface level inside the system to a sudden change in wind is a transient seiche, which dissipates within two to three cycles, each lasting 3hr. After the oscillations, the system reaches a new equilibrium. We show in theory that this is a damped oscillation and as wind changes, an adjustment to a new equilibrium goes much faster than a complete tidal period. This leads to the quasi steady state balance of subtidal wind-driven flows with essentially no phase lag with wind even though wind changes with time continuously. Wind-induced circulation behaves differently from the Csanady model with Earth rotation but similar to the prismatic lake model of Engelund without Coriolis: The coastal and shallow regions tend to have flows in the direction of wind, while the interior and deeper waters have return flows against the wind especially in bottom layer. The surface flow may not be in the direction of wind, while the bottom usually has broad and uniform counter wind flows. Plain Language Summary In a choked or restricted shallow lagoon, wind-driven flows are confirmed to be a surprising quasi steady state. Numerical experiments show that any change in wind would produce a hydrodynamic perturbation in the form of seiche that dissipates quickly in two to three cycles, leading to a fast return to a new equilibrium or quasi steady state. This warrants examination of wind-driven flows at constant speed for different scenarios (wind from different directions) and not to worry too much about the temporal variation of wind or history of wind. Earth rotation in such system is found to be negligible for wind-driven circulations: The experiment shows that the relative error is only 0.3% if Coriolis force is turned off for Lake Pontchartrain.

To date, few studies have combined modern hydrological conditions with paleoclimate records to explore the mechanism(s) of these changes. This study seeks to improve understanding of hydrological variability on decadal and centennial timescales in the SAYR and to identify its general cause. We first determined annual fluctuations in the surface area of Lake Ngoring from 1985 to 2020 using multi-temporal Landsat images. The results show that lake surface area changes were generally consistent with variations in precipitation, streamflow and the regional dry-wet index in the SAYR, suggesting that the water balance of the Lake Ngoring area is closely associated with regional hydroclimate changes. These records are also comparable to the stalagmite delta 18O monsoon record, as well fluctuations in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Moreover, an association of high TSI (total solar insolation) anomalies and sunspot numbers with the expansion of Lake Ngoring surface area is observed, implying that solar activity is the key driving factor for hydrologic variability in the SAYR on a decadal timescale. Following this line of reasoning, we compared the delta 13Corg-based lake level fluctuations of Lake Ngoring for the last millennium, as previously reported, with the hydroclimatic history and the reconstructed TSI record. We conclude that the hydrological regime of Lake Ngoring has been mainly controlled by centennial fluctuations in precipitation for the last millennium, which is also dominated by solar activity. In general, it appears that solar activity has exerted a dominant influence on the hydrological regime of the SAYR on both decadal and centennial timescales, which is clearly manifested in the variations of lake area and water level of Lake Ngoring.																			2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2023	17	4					920	932		10.1007/s11707-022-1069-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-022-1069-z		JAN 2024											WOS:001147304900001
J	Rae, R; Vincent, WF				Rae, R; Vincent, WF			Effects of temperature and ultraviolet radiation on microbial foodweb structure: potential responses to global change	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A series of growth experiments were conducted with natural plankton communities from a lake and river in northern Quebec, to evaluate the response of microbial foodweb structure to changes in ambient temperature and solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). 2. Bioassays were incubated for 6 days at two temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) and three near-surface irradiance conditions [photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) + UVA + UVB, PAR + UVA, and PAR only). 3. The concentration of total bacteria showed no net response to temperature, but the percentage of actively respiring bacteria, as measured with the cellular redox probe 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC), was up to 57% higher at 20 degrees C relative to 10 degrees C. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the <2 mu m size fraction also reacted strongly to temperature, with a net increase of up to 61% over the temperature range of 10-20 degrees C. 4. The UVR effects were small or undetectable for most of the measured variables; however, the percentage of actively respiring bacteria was significantly inhibited in the presence of UVR at 20 degrees C, decreasing by 29-48% on day 6 in the lake experiments and by 59% on day 2 in one river experiment. 4. The UVR effects were small or undetectable for most of the measured variables; however, the percentage of actively respiring bacteria was significantly inhibited in the presence of UVR at 20 degrees C, decreasing by 29-48% on day 6 in the lake experiments and by 59% on day 2 in one river experiment. 5. The results show differential sensitivity to temperature among organisms of microbial communities in subarctic freshwaters, and a resilience by the majority of microorganisms to their present UVR conditions. Microbial foodwebs in northern freshwaters appear to be relatively unresponsive to short-term (days) changes in UVR. However, the observed responses to temperature suggest that climate change could influence community structure, with warmer temperatures favouring picoplanktonic phototrophs and heterotrophs, and a shift in nanoplankton species composition and size structure.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0046-5070					DEC	1998	40	4					747	758		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00361.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00361.x													WOS:000077818600012
J	Leathwick, JR; Collier, KJ; Hicks, BJ; Ling, N; Stichbury, G; de Winton, M				Leathwick, John R.; Collier, Kevin J.; Hicks, Brendan J.; Ling, Nicholas; Stichbury, Glen; de Winton, Mary			Predictions of establishment risk highlight biosurveillance priorities for invasive fish in New Zealand lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The ability to predict invasive species spread is essential for effective biosecurity management and the allocation of scarce monitoring resources. Prevention of invasive fish incursions poses a significant challenge because of the wide physiological tolerances of many species, their mobility and the role that human vectors play in their spread. In New Zealand, seven introduced fish species are distributed to varying extents in lakes across the two main islands. We used field survey data from 470 New Zealand lakes to fit statistical models of the current geographic distributions of seven introduced species; the resulting models were then used to predict risks of future establishment of each species in 3595 New Zealand lakes >1ha. Initial models fitted using lake- and catchment-scale environmental predictors identified summer temperature among the top two most influential variables, with lake density and size also important for some species. Distribution models for Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and tench (Tinca tinca) were substantially improved by the addition of variables describing human population densities and lake accessibility. All seven species occurred most frequently in lakes close to human population centres suggesting that human-mediated dispersal has played at least some role in determining current distributions. Addition of a spatial variable, representing the presence or absence of the modelled species within the broader catchment within which each lake is located, improved the predictive performance of models for the brown bullhead catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus), perch and rudd. This finding indicates that the current distributions of these species include clusters of lakes within occupied' catchments, resulting in geographic patchiness that is independent of the available environmental and human population predictors. This distribution has most likely resulted from spread into accessible and suitable lakes from one or more initial liberation points, either by natural dispersal along waterways or through human-assisted movement. Predictions to all mapped lakes throughout New Zealand indicate (i) that the potential for future spread is greatest for catfish, perch and rudd and (ii) the high vulnerability to invasion for lakes along the east coast of both islands and in inland montane regions of the South Island. Our results allow for improved identification of lakes likely to be suitable for invasive fish species and which should therefore be accorded priority for surveillance; they highlight in particular the potential for perch and catfish to establish in higher-elevation lakes distant from human population centres.

J	Scully, NJ				Scully, Norbert J.			Root distribution and environment in a maple-oak forest - Contributions of the Hull Botanical Laboratory 537	BOTANICAL GAZETTE												Study was made of the relationships of the Bellefontaine silt loam soil profile, with all its inclusions, to the root development of the native spp. in the maple-oak forest at Wychwood, Lake Geneva, Wisc, during the summers of 1938, 1939, and 1940. Stations were selected so as to obtain a cross-section of the varying conditions within the woodland. 16 station-types were investigated by the trench method of root-distribution sampling. Root-ends were mapped on vertical profiles by size classes. In 6 of the station-types a new, square method of trenching afforded more accurate measurement of the heterogeneous root distribution evident throughout the woodland than did the rectangular trenches most commonly employed. Square trenches were 4X4 ft. The area charted on each wall was 3 ft. long and to the depth of the trench. Rectangular trenches were 7 1/2 ft. long and 2 1/2 ft. wide. The area charted was 6 ft. long, to the depth of the trench, and on the long wall nearest magnetic north. Greatest conc. of the smallest roots, 0-1 mm. in diam., was noted in the A1 horizon, indicating location of much of the water-absorbing surface. On a root number and % root area basis, the specific horizons generally showed successive decrease in suitability for root development. Areas with dearth of ground cover showed low root numbers and comparatively high percentage root areas. Stations with abundant ground cover were characterized by larger root numbers and smaller percentage root areas. Root vol. samples were approx. equal to that found in the adjacent grassland regions. Earthworm and cicada activities, particularly the former, play important roles in the soil environment.																			0006-8071					MAR	1942	103	3					492	517		10.1086/335065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/335065													WOS:000202871100004

Interaction of aquifer-wetland in a zone of intensive agriculture: the case of Campo de Dalias (Almeria, SE Spain)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Campo de Dalias (Almeria, south-eastern Spain) was the backdrop for the development of intensive agricultural activity during the 1970s. Due to the poor natural soil development, the agriculturalists opted for a system that involved quarrying silt and clay deposits that could be used as soil in the greenhouses. In parallel, poor water quality in the upper aquifer caused the gradual abandonment of boreholes and a generalised rise in piezometric levels. These factors have favoured the formation of a series of artificial wetlands in the abandoned clay pits (Onayar, Cabriles and Balsa del Sapo ("Toad Pond") being the most significant). In Balsa del Sapo, the water column rose 3.5 m between October 2007 and February 2011. There has been a continuous fall in the electrical conductivity of the surface water, which has gone from 14,500 A mu S cm(-1) in 2004 to 4,100 A mu S cm(-1) in 2013. The most recent concentrations are close to those found in the groundwater. The same situation is detected for Cl, SO4 and Na ion concentrations in the surface and groundwater. These data show the groundwater-surface water interaction in the Balsa del Sapo. Nevertheless, the sharp rise in surface water level has created a flood hazard (due to the shallow topography of the area), both for people living in the vicinity and their property. This is an endorheic zone where a number of ramblas (gullies) draining the southern face of the Sierra de Gador mountains converge. The Campo de Dalias is a spectacular example of the changes that can occur in a semiarid agricultural area as a result of intensive groundwater abstraction. These changes are directly related to the management of water resources, the most recent consequence of which is the increased risk of flooding. Hence, there is a need to consider the management of these water resources to achieve a more sustainable use, which is compatible with the environmental protection of the wetland and which will give some guarantee of flood protection for people and property.

Using field-based, photogrammetric point cloud, orthophoto and LiDAR-derived metrics to assess forest structure-snowpack relationships in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest region	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												The efficacy of field-based, photogrammetric point cloud, orthophoto and light detection and ranging datasets to describe forest structure and resolve forest-snowpack relationships in a mixed forest region was evaluated over two years at the point and transect scales. Hemispheric photo-derived canopy metrics correlated well with remotely sensed metrics, but tree bole metrics were not effectively derived from remotely sensed data. Significant differences in melt rate and snow-free date were found across forest type at the transect scale. Field and remotely sensed estimates of canopy cover were highly correlated with melt rate and snow-free date at the point scale, which aligns with previous literature and understanding of snowmelt processes. However, significant correlations were only present during the 2016 study year, which was attributed to canopy-controlled solar radiation-driven melt in 2016 versus more spatially uniform turbulent flux-driven melt in 2017. Peak snow water equivalent metrics were not correlated well with canopy or tree height metrics, contrary to previous research. This was likely due to mid-winter melt events throughout both study years, where a mix of accumulation and melt processes confounded forest-snowpack relationships. This study demonstrates that widely available remotely sensed data with a broad coverage can be used to: (i) describe forest-snowpack relationships in mixed hardwood, coniferous forests and (ii) elucidate the variability of forest-snowpack relationships under different climate conditions in this environment.

The SAR data were acquired with the ESA airborne SnowSAR sensor in winter 2012 over Lake Orajarvi in northern Finland and over landfast ice in the Bay of Bothnia of the Baltic Sea. Co-incident with the SnowSAR acquisitions, in situ snow and ice data were measured. In addition, time series of TerraSAR-X images and ice mass balance buoy data were acquired for Lake Orajarvi in 2011-2012. The main objective of our study was to investigate relationships between SAR backscattering signatures and snow depth over lake and sea ice, with the ultimate objective of assessing the feasibility of retrieval of snow characteristics using X- and Ku-band dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR over freshwater or sea ice. This study constitutes the first comprehensive survey of snow backscattering signatures at these two combined frequencies over both lake and sea ice. For lake ice, we show that X-band VH-polarized backscattering coefficient (sigma o) and the Ku-band VV/VH-ratio exhibited the highest sensitivity to the snow depth. For sea ice, the highest sensitivity to the snow depth was found from the Ku-band VV-polarized sigma o and the Ku-band VV/VH-ratio. However, the observed relations were relatively weak, indicating that at least for the prevailing snow conditions, obtaining reliable estimates of snow depth over lake and sea ice would be challenging using only X- and Ku-band backscattering information.

A mid-Holocene environmental change in Amazonian savannas	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY					Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Tropical-Biology-and-Conservation	2005	Uberlandia, BRAZIL	Canadian Assoc Phys Anthropol				Aim The main goal of this study was to investigate how climate and human activities may have influenced ecotonal areas of disjoint savannas within Brazilian Amazonia. Location Eastern Brazilian Amazonia, Amapa State. Methods The fossil pollen and charcoal records of two lakes in Amapa (Marcio and Tapera) were used to provide a Holocene palaeoecological history of eastern Amazonian savannas. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to enhance the patterns of sample distribution along the sediment core. Results Even though sedimentary hiatuses were recognized in the sediment cores from both lakes, a marked change in vegetation from closed forests with swamp elements to open flooded savanna at c. 5000 yr BP was evident from the pollen record. Charcoal analysis revealed a pattern of increased accumulation of charred particles coincident with the establishment of savanna vegetation, suggesting higher fire frequency near the lakes. Because the timing of the sedimentary hiatus overlapped with the highest Holocene sea level, which would have increased the local water table preventing the lakes from drying out, we infer that both lakes used to depend heavily on flood waters, and the sedimentary gap was caused by reduced discharge from the Amazon River, due to a dry period in the Andes, when precipitation levels markedly decreased between 8000 and 5000 yr BP. The lack of Andean pollen (probably river transported) in the sediment record after this event and the existence of similar records near the study site make this interpretation more appealing. The resumption of sedimentation in Lake Marcio, contemporaneous with falling sea level and increasingly wet conditions in the Andes after 5000 yr BP, indicates that Holocene sea-level variation did not play an important role in maintaining lake levels. Main conclusions The study site recorded-long-term occupation by pre-Columbian peoples. However, it is still unclear whether these disjoint savannas have an anthropogenic origin. Even though locally dry environmental conditions were inferred from both records, there is no evidence of a mid-Holocene dry climate in eastern Amazonia. Instead, the Amapa record indicates a connection between Andean climate and eastern Amazonia, demonstrating the need for a better understanding of the impacts and magnitude of climate changes.					de Toledo, Mauro/N-5732-2015														0305-0270	1365-2699				AUG	2007	34	8					1313	1326		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01606.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01606.x													WOS:000248851000005
J	GODFREY, H				GODFREY, H			ON THE ECOLOGY OF SKEENA RIVER WHITEFISHES, COREGONUS AND PROSOPIUM	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Incidental information on the ecology of the common (Eastern) whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis, and the Rocky Mountain whitefish, Prosopium williamsoni, was collected in the course of the Skeena River Salmon Investigation of 1944-1948. The common whitefish has been found in only 4 Skeena lakes, which have characteristics that are mainly oligotrophic. Rocky Mountain whitefish were taken in all the lakes where netting was done, which included warm and shallow, as well as deep and cold, bodies of water. The bottom fauna of Lakelse, Babine and Morrison Lakes was described. During the summer common whitefish were most abundant in depths of 10-15 m, and Rocky Mountain whitefish at 5-10 m. The food of the 2 species was very similar, and consisted mostly of bottom organisms. An exception was the common whitefish in Morrison Lake, which had fed almost wholly upon plankton crustaceans. This situation was associated with the paucity of bottom fauna in the lake. The important competitors for food of the whitefishes, identified on the basis of common food and habitat, were peamouth chub, Mylocheilus caurinum, and squawfish, Ptychocheilus oregonense. Chief predators of the whitefish were lake trout, Cristivomer namaycush, and ling, Lota lota. However, there was no evidence that predation upon either whitefish was particularly serious. The oldest common whitefish were X years of age (473 mm fork length), and Rocky Mountain whitefish IX years (365 mm fork length). No food organisms occur in the Skeena lakes in such abundance as do certain amphipods in other Canadian lakes where the common whitefish is fished commercially. This scarcity of suitable food is considered to be the main condition limiting the abundance of the Skeena populations of common whitefish.																									1955	12	4					499	542		10.1139/f55-028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-028													WOS:A1955WZ51400002

Lack of a reliable, timely diagnostic for sepsis leads to under- and overdiagnosis, suboptimal outcomes, and strained hospital resources. Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center (OLOLRMC) implemented a sepsis learning health program to evaluate and improve outcomes through standardized ED workflows and the incorporation of a novel sepsis diagnostic test. Methods: We report the results of the first year of experience following the implementation of the learning health initiative and sepsis testing. Data from the Epic EHR were analyzed across two groups: pre-implementation (April 2023-July 2023) vs. post-implementation (August 2023-July 2024), and temporally matched cohorts (April-July 2023 vs. April-July 2024). We assessed clinical outcomes (sepsis-associated mortality, hospital length of stay, or HLOS), and resource utilization (antibiotic use, blood cultures). Results: Post-implementation, sepsis-associated mortality dropped from 10.9% to 6.6% in the temporally matched group (p < 0.001). There was also a 0.76-day reduction in mean HLOS among sepsis DRG patients (p < 0.05). Blood culture utilization fell from 50.8% to 45.7%, driven by reductions in blood culture utilization among patients receiving a Band 1 IntelliSep score. Conclusions: The FMOLHS experience demonstrated significant benefits to patient outcomes and resource utilization after implementing a sepsis QI initiative including protocolized and standardized ED workflows via a nurse-driven triage system with sepsis testing for the early risk stratification of patients who present to the ED with signs and symptoms of infection.					; Jagneaux, Tonya/NOF-5896-2025; Wyler, Benjamin/HHZ-5592-2022	Sorrells, Matthew/0000-0003-4624-2227; O'Neal, Hollis/0000-0001-8854-6822														2227-9032				MAY 28	2025	13	11							1273	10.3390/healthcare13111273	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/healthcare13111273								40508886					WOS:001506519400001

The site was completely excavated and underwent anthropological analysis, published by Nils-Gustaf Gejvall in 1960. A number of early radiocarbon datings were later obtained (Gejvall 1968). In 2009 a new study of the church, site, burials and humans was presented by Elisabeth Iregren and collaborators, and new attempts were made to date the burial ground. Two series of radiocarbon dating have been performed. One aimed at finding the foundation of the site and one sought to identify the last burials. The datings have, however, been questioned in general and supposed to be severely influenced by a reservoir effect. This problem has now been faced through a detailed analysis of available stable carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements-performed by Iregren and collaborators-from the site, the region and elsewhere. Data from humans, domesticates and wild mammals have been used. In addition, the reservoir effect on fish from the surrounding Lake Storsj & ouml;n has been measured. Combining all this information and applying the diet analysis program FRUITS we found out that the influence of a reservoir effect on the radiocarbon dates is limited to about 100 years. Based on this, a recalibration of the available radiocarbon dates determines that the beginning of the use of the churchyard with 95% probability falls in the interval 1140-1300 AD and the ending within the interval 1330-1470 AD. We thus conclude that the cemetery was in use from 1140 AD until 1470 AD.					Olsen, Jesper/F-1656-2013														0015-7813	1404-9430					2025	120	1																						WOS:001476863800002
C	Rogow, M; Sellwood, S			API	Rogow, M; Sellwood, S			Spill prevention at inland marinas: A Shasta Lake, California, case study	1997 INTERNATIONAL OIL SPILL CONFERENCE: IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION					International Oil Spill Conference - Improving Environmental Protection	APR 07-10, 1997	FT LAUDERDALE, FL	US Coast Guard, US EPA, Amer Petr Inst, Int Petr Ind Environm Conservat Assoc, Int Maritime Org				Since the enactment of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90), there has been a greater focus on spill prevention and response preparedness at large marine transfer facilities. Little attention, however, has been paid to facilities that fall short of 42,000 gallons. Many of these smaller facilities, which are located on the nation's inland waterways, are marinas that fuel recreational boats. Spill prevention at facilities on inland waterways is complicated by factors such as location, hydrologic conditions, regulation under multiple jurisdictions, and lack of available technology. This paper discusses the various types of petroleum product storage, transfer, and delivery system, as well as spill prevention measures employed by marinas on Shasta Lake, California. Shasta Lake is a mecca of recreational boating, having almost a dozen marinas along its shores. Like many inland waterways, Shasta Lake is affected by precipitation and dam control, which drastically change the surface are of the lake. To stay afloat and operational, marinas, including their fuel transfer capabilities, must be mobile. This presents complex technical and environmental issues for the marinas, which use different combinations of equipment for storing and transferring fuel. Storage systems include fixed or mobile, aboveground or underground storage tanks and floating fuel systems. The piping used to deliver fuel to dispensers located on the marina dock is usually a combination of rigid and flexible lines. Each system is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, with every facility varying in compliance levels. By evaluating the precarious situations and spill events at Shasta Lake and other marinas, we can better assist in compliance efforts and more effectively protect our nation's waterways from oil spills.																									1997							365	371																WOS:000073241400053

The two records cover the period from-9500 to 4500 cal yr BP. Climate and palaeoenvironmental changes during this period were inferred from diatom assemblages, interpretation of variations in their oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)Odiatom), reconstruction of lake water conductivity from diatom-based transfer functions, and estimation of the lake water balance (Evaporation/Inflow ratio, E/I). Our findings provide evidence for two distinct lacustrine episodes. During the early to mid-Holocene transition, low delta O-18-diatom values, high percentages of planktonic diatoms, low lake water conductivity and a positive water balance (E/I < 1) suggest wet conditions, which were likely related to the optimum of the AHHP. From the mid-to late Holocene transition, an aridification trend is revealed by increasing delta O-18-diatom values, high percentages of benthic diatoms and a negative water budget (E/I > 1), occurring as early as 6500 cal yr BP and intensifying after 5300 cal yr BP. Moreover, our data show on average a decrease in precipitation amounts of-35% between the peak and the end of the AHHP in the Tibesti region. This timing of the AHHP in the mountainous Tibesti is consistent with the aridification of the central Sahara recorded at lowland sites, which has mainly been related to the southward retreat of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the associated African monsoonal rainfall belt, following the gradually declining summer insolation that led to the termination of the AHHP. Our results prove the existence of Holocene lakes in the TVM craters that developed contemporaneously with the lakes of the Chadian basin and the Libyan Sahara. On a broader scale, our data share similar hydroclimatic patterns with studies from the eastern and northern Sahara. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bazzanti, M; Coccia, C; Dowgiallo, MG				Bazzanti, Marcello; Coccia, Cristina; Dowgiallo, Maria Giuseppina			Microdistribution of macroinvertebrates in a temporary pond of Central Italy: Taxonomic and functional analyses	LIMNOLOGICA												Spatial distribution of physical and chemical variables and macroinvertebrate composition, structure and functional aspects were investigated in five microhabitats available (Ranunculus acquatilis+ Ranunculus sardous, Spirogyra sp., Juncus effusus, and unvegetated littoral sediments and central sediments) in a temporary pond near Rome during spring 2004. The central sediments were found to differ greatly from the other substrates. They were characterized by higher nutrient contents (total P, total N), organic matter and organic C, and silt and clay in the sediments, and lower dissolved oxygen content and lower pH in the water. Species richness and densities of total macrofauna showed the lowest values in central sediments and the highest ones in submerged macrophytes (Ranunculus spp.) and emergent vegetation (Juncus effusus). Oligochaeta Tubificidae, some Nematoda (Dorylaimus spp.), and Chironomidae Tanypodinae (Procladius sp. and Psectrotanypus varius) and Chironominae (Chironomus plumosus group) characterized the central sediments, whereas Ephemeroptera and most of the Odonata and Coleoptera species were commonly found in submerged macrophyte beds. Some species of Coleoptera and Hemiptera (Hygrobia hermanni, Helochares lividus, Berosus signaticollis and Gerris maculatus) were mainly found in the algal substratum, and some Nematoda species (Tobrilus spp. and Aporcelaimellus obtusicaudatus), Oligochaeta Enchytraeidae, young larvae of Sympetrum and Diptera Ceratopogonidae in littoral sediments. Juncus effusus appeared to be mainly colonized by Chironomidae Orthocladiinae (Psectrocladius sordidellus group and Cotynoneura scutellata) and Tanytarsini (Paratanytarsus sp.). Central sediments also favoured high abundances of collector-gatherers, burrowers and drought resistant forms with passive dispersal, whereas Ranunculus spp. hosted mainly scrapers, shredders, swimmers+divers and active dispersal forms without any resistant stages to desiccation. Juncus plants were mostly colonized by collector-filterers and by organisms capable of both active dispersal and surviving desiccation. Littoral sediments and algae showed similar functional organization and intermediate features between central sediments and submerged macrophyte beds. All these results demonstrate that microhabitat characteristics play a crucial role in selecting macroinvertebrate taxa according to their environmental requirement, feeding mechanism, movement and resistance to drought. Moreover, our study confirms the role of submerged and emergent vegetation in maintaining high biodiversity and suggests that all microhabitats should be considered to provide both an exhaustive collection of species for pond management and conservation and basic insights into the functioning of pond communities.

J	Murugavel, P; Pandian, TJ				Murugavel, P; Pandian, TJ			Effect of altitude on hydrology, productivity and species richness in Kodayar - a tropical peninsular Indian aquatic system	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To study effects of altitude, monthly sampling was undertaken from June 1993 to May 1996 in the upper Kodayar reservoir (1312 m ASL), the lower Kodayar (92 m ASL) and Azhakia Pandiapuram (plain) (Tamilnadu, India). Temperature decreased with elevation at a rate of 1 degrees C per 240 m; the thermal range also decreased with increasing altitude. The number of days and quantity of precipitation decreased from 161 days and 366 cm yr(-1) in the upper Kodayar to 92 days and 127 cm yr(-1) at the Azhakia Pandiapuram (APP). Transparency decreased from 1.5 m at the upper Kodayar to about 0.5 m at the APP. Dissolved oxygen increased with decreasing altitude but remained high (> 7 mg l(-1)) in all the three systems. Throughout the investigation, the upper Kodayar reservoir (< 6.8) and lower Kodayar lake (< 7.0) remained acidic, while the APP was always alkaline. Trends for CO2 and alkalinity of the three Kodayar systems were parallel to those for pH. Though widely oscillating across calendar months, nitrate averaged c. 30 mu g l(-1), while phosphate increased from 8 mu g l(-1) in the upper Kodayar to 18 mu g l(-1) at the APP. Wide oscillations in nitrate suggest that it may be limiting productivity more than phosphorus. Chlorophyll-a values were c. 1.9 mu g l(-1) throughout the year in the upper Kodayar, and between 10 and 20 mu g l(-1) in the other two ecosystems; values peaked during the dry season, from January to April. Chlorophyll-a concentrations correlated positively with productivity; every mu g increase in chlorophyll-a caused 0.15 gC m(-3) d(-1) more production. The pristine water of the fragile upper Kodayar had the lowest productivity, and poorest diversity and population density. The species richness was assessed using organisms larger than 75 mu m filtered by a plankton net. There were five species (Staurastrum spp., Staurodesmus spp., Botryococcus) of phytoplankton, and three species of cladocerans and five species of copepods; population density averaged to 159 l(-1) for phytoplankton, 0.3 l(-1) for zooplankton. The lower Kodayar proved to be the richest for species diversity; there were 14 species of phytoplankton and six species of cladocerans and six species of copepods. Population density averaged to 203 l(-1) for phytoplankton and 0.44 l(-1) for zooplankton. The APP displayed moderate species richness; there were seven species of phytoplankton and six species of cladocerans, eight species of copepods and three species of rotifer; but the population density was comparatively higher than the upper and lower Kodayar; it averaged 412 l(-1) for phytoplankton and 5.9 l(-1) for zooplankton. These values fell within the range of values reported for other tropical and temperate lakes. Staurastrum, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Tropocyclops, Thermocyclops and Mesocyclops sp. were present in all the aquatic systems and tolerated wide range pH between 6.5 and 8.0. APP was the most productive (4.4 gC m(-3) d(-1)). Productivity holds positive correlation with pH and temperature; for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature it increased by 0.39 gC m(-3) d(-1) in these aquatic systems.

To understand the source of the groundwater of the BJD and their possible associations with nearby bodies of water, we analyzed variations of stable isotope ratios (delta D and delta O-18) and the deuterium excess (d-excess) of groundwater and precipitation in the BJD, of groundwater, precipitation, river and spring water in the UR, and of groundwater and river water in the middle and lower reaches (MR and LR) of the HRB. In addition, the climatic condition under which the groundwater was formed in the BJD was also discussed. We found obvious differences in delta D, delta O-18, and d-excess among groundwater in the BJD, nearby water bodies and the HRB. The groundwater delta D-delta O-18 equation for the BJD was delta D = 4.509 delta O-18-30.620, with a slope and intercept similar to that of nearby areas (4.856 and -29.574), indicating a strong evaporation effect in the BJD and its surrounding areas. The equation's slope of the BJD was significantly lower than those of HRB groundwater (6.634), HRB river water (6.202), precipitation in the BJD and Youqi (7.841), and the UR of the HRB (7.839). The d-excess (-17.5 parts per thousand) of the BJD was significantly lower than those of nearby groundwater (-7.4 parts per thousand), HRB groundwater (12.1 parts per thousand), precipitation in the BJD (5.7 parts per thousand) and in the UR of the HRB (15.2 parts per thousand), and HRB river water (14.4 parts per thousand). The spatial patterns of delta O-18 and d-excess values in the BJD suggest mixing and exchange of groundwater between the BJD and neighboring regions, but no hydraulic relationship between the BJD groundwater and water from more distant regions except Outer Mongolia, which is north of the BJD. Moreover, we conclude that there is little precipitation recharge to groundwater because of the obvious d-excess difference between groundwater and local precipitation, low precipitation, and high evaporation rates. The abnormally negative d-excess values in groundwater of the BJD indicate that this water was formed in the past under higher relative humidity and lower temperatures than modern values.

J	MELQUIST, WE; HORNOCKER, MG				MELQUIST, WE; HORNOCKER, MG			ECOLOGY OF RIVER OTTERS IN WEST CENTRAL IDAHO	WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS												A river otter (L. canadensis) population was studied in west central Idaho from June, 1976-May, 1981. Captures (60) were made of 43 otters. The minimum population estimate was 41 otters in 1979. Densities ranged from 1 otter/2.7-5.8 km of waterway in the 4 regions of the study area, a combined density of 1 other/3.9 km of waterway. Female otters in Idaho gave birth during late March or early April, about 11 mo. after copulation. Recruitment rate was estimated at 2.4 pups/breeding female. Family breakup occurred as early as Nov., but no later than March. Man-related factors, primarily roadkills, were responsible for 6 of the 9 known mortalities on the study area. Otter foraging techniques varied according to habitat and type of prey hunted. There was no evidence that otters severely reduced prey populations. Fish were the most important prey of otters during each season, occurring in 93-100% of the 1902 scats analyzed. Otters supplemented their fish diet with invertebrates, birds, mammals and reptiles. Travel routes of instrumented otters followed streams. Food appeared to exert the greatest influence on frequency of movement by otters and, to a lesser extent, the distance traveled. Otters dispersed in April and May at 12-13 mo. of age. Not all otters dispersed, suggesting an unequal development of the dispersing tendency among individuals. Otters tended to be more diurnal in winter and nocturnal during the other seasons. Prey availability influenced the extent of activity but not periodicity. The influence of human activity, temperature, wind and precipitation appeared negligible. Habitat use based on 2165 transmitter locations indicated that otters preferred valley to mountain habitats and stream-associated habitats to lakes, reservoirs and ponds. Although food had the greatest influence on habitat use, adequate shelter was necessary for the habitat to be used extensively. Rather than excavate their own dens, otters used natural formations, man-made structures and dens built by other animals. Beaver bank dens and lodges accounted for 38% of the resting sites used by instrumental otters. Home range shape was determined by drainage patterns and size was measured in kilometers of waterway. Home ranges overlapped extensively and ranged in length from 8-78 km in a season. Prey availability, habitat, weather conditions, topography, the reproductive cycle and conspecifics influenced home range use and length. The basic social group consisted of an adult female and her juvenile offspring. Sociality in otters was greater than that reported for most mustelids. Lone otters occasionally associated with other individuals and family groups, although most of these associations were of short duration. Overt aggression rarely occurred, as otters resolved potential confrontations through mutual avoidance. Communication among river otters was achieved through olfactory, auditory and tactile signals. Scent marking by feces, urine and possibly anal sac secretions was the most important mode of inter-group communication. Otters exhibited a personal space dispersion whereby the individual and its current location were defended without reference to fixed spatial boundaries. Through mutual avoidance, this type of spacing strategy allowed otters to use the same areas.																			0084-0173	1938-5455					1983		83					1	60																WOS:A1983QN36200001

Assessing wildfire potential in a coastal forest watershed, British Columbia, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wildfire disturbance in coastal western Canada has varied with changes in climate and human activity. Although infrequent during the past century, large fires in coastal forests occurred in the past, and current and future fire hazard are uncertain. We used multiple lines of evidence to characterize the contemporary regime of a forested water supply area around greater Victoria (GVWSA), British Columbia (BC), Canada, to provide a framework for assessing fire hazard more broadly in Pacific coast watersheds. Threshold conditions for locally significant fires (LSF; >10 ha) were established using recent fire and weather records. These data were used to 1) define baseline fire danger climatology for the GVWSA; 2) model fire behaviour and annual or cumulative burn probability (BP) across the region; 3) compare BP with late holocene fire return intervals derived from paleo-charcoal samples; and 4) evaluate modelling using recent fire records and case studies. The fire season was 14 days longer in the drier eastern portion of the watershed compared with the western portion. The fire season in recent years (2010-2022) was more pronounced, with higher Fire Weather Index (FWI) quantiles compared with older (1996-2009) records. LSF occurred under Fire Weather Index (FWI) >= 32 conditions (similar to 93rd percentile), although rare landscape-scale fires (> 1000 ha) were associated with more extreme events (approx. FWI >= similar to 50, ca. 99.6th percentile), particularly summer outflow conditions. Models suggest that stands of mature Douglas-fir, the dominant vegetation type, require high sustained winds during high to extreme danger conditions for crown fire occurrence. The overall BP was lower (by 50-70 %) than values from interior BC, while the distribution of BP across the GVWSA reflected the influences of lightning maxima on exposed ridges and potential human ignitions outside the perimeter. Simulated fires were mostly small to moderate in size (median= 52 ha; 90 % < 308 ha), with the largest reaching similar to 2800 ha within a 7 km fireshed. Charcoal-based paleofire reconstruction suggest the persistence of fire occurrence patterns. Data from four lakes around the watershed generally supported the landscape BP variability. Late-Holocene fire frequency was consistently 50-100 % higher than surrounding modelled present-day BP, reflecting the persistence of local climatic and topographic influences despite changes to anthropogenic influences. Wildfire potential in the forests of SVI is lower than in continental regions but poses a growing risk to water resources and other values. Environmental variability and sparse fire records suggest a multi-proxy approach can be effective for informing managers of fire hazard in similar areas of the Pacific coast.					; Perrakis, Daniel/JWO-0884-2024	Perrakis, Daniel/0000-0002-8917-8694; 													0378-1127	1872-7042				AUG 15	2025	590								122796	10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122796													WOS:001499304700001

In this study, we aim to further identify BHPs related to ecological niches and/or specific bacteria by characterizing the distribution of BHPs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the water column and in sediments in a range of lakes and coastal lagoons from the Azores Archipelago, as well as in a coculture enriched for methanotrophs. Sediment samples from Azorean lakes with low-oxygen conditions during the summer months (i.e., Azul, Verde, Funda, and Negra) contain relatively high abundances of BHPs that are typically associated with methane-oxidizing (methanotrophic) bacteria (i.e., aminotetrol, aminopentol, and methylcarbamateaminopentol), as well as the ethenolamine-BHPs (i.e., ethenolamine-BHpentol and ethenolamine-BHhexol) and the N-formylated aminoBHPs. Both ethenolamine-BHPs and N-formylated aminoBHPs were also detected in a methanotroph-methylotroph co-culture that was enriched from a lake. In the SPM of all water columns, bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT), BHT cyclitol ether, and aminotriol are the dominant BHPs. In SPM from Lake Funda, nucleoside BHPs (i.e., Me-adenosylhopane(HG-diMe) (where HG refers to head group), N1-methylinosylhopane, 2Me-N1-inosylhopane, and Me-N1-inosylhopane) are present in low abundance or absent under oxic conditions but increase in concentration near the chemocline, suggesting potential in situ production of these nucleoside BHPs rather than an allochthonous origin. In contrast, sediments from shallow, well-mixed lakes (i.e., Empadadas, Sao Jorge, and Lomba) contain higher abundances of adenosylhopane and N1-methylinosylhopane, which likely originate from bacteria living in nearby soils. Based on our current results we revised the existing R-soil index, which was previously used to infer terrestrial inputs to aquatic environments, to exclude any potential nucleosides produced in the lake water column (Rsoil-lake). In the coastal lagoons, Cubres East and Cubres West, methoxylated BHTs were detected, and higher abundances of ethenolamine-BHT were observed. This study highlights the diversity of BHPs in lakes and coastal lagoons and their potential as taxonomic markers for bacteria associated with certain ecological niches, which can be preserved in sedimentary records.

Respondent uncertainty and reliability in contingent valuation-A case of the Dalai Lake protected area	LIMNOLOGICA												This paper focuses on examining the validity and reliability of the contingent valuation method (CVM) in the case of evaluation of ecotourism resources in Dalai Lake Protected Area (DLPA). The CVM is a primary method to evaluate resource value, however, it is subject to criticism because of its bias. Many factors result in CVM evaluation bias, which decreases validity of the method. An important factor is that the CVM assumes that all of the respondents are certain about their answers. In fact, many respondents are not very certain about their answer, therefore, identifying the respondents' certainty level and exploring a proper method to address it are critical issues. There are three objectives in the present study: first, to identify the uncertainty treatment that can more significantly reduce the hypothetical bias, resulting in a greater closeness to the Willingness to Pay (WTP) in a real setting; second, to identify the determinants of the respondents' uncertainty; and third, to test the reliability of the respondents' payment in a real setting and a hypothetical setting by comparison with our study in 2010. One thousand three hundred fifty questionnaires about the DLPA were distributed in face-to-face interviews targeted at Hulunbeier inhabitants, and 1142 questionnaires were collected. The primary main conclusions are summarized as follows. First, the treatment of a real setting reduced the hypothetical bias, increased the WTP accuracy and had better reliability compared with the hypothetical setting. Second, income, impact (the impact of resource development on DLPA) and environmental attitudes had a significant positive influence on the respondents' certainty in hypothetical and real settings, and income and impact of resource development on DLPA had more significant influences in the real setting than in the hypothetical setting. Third, the computation of the mean WTP showed that the exposure model and the asymmetric uncertainty model YES6 fell within the 95% interval around the point estimated from the real model. The WTP of the SUM (symmetric uncertainty model) was much higher than that of the real model and the hypothetical model. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Focused and diffuse effluxes Of CO2 from mud volcanoes and mofettes south of Mt. Etna (Italy)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					8th International Conference on Gas Geochemistry	OCT 02-08, 2005	Sicily, ITALY					Several sites with anomalous emissions of carbon dioxide were investigated in the region south of Mt. Etna volcano in order to assess the types of emission (focused and/or diffuse), their surface extension and the total output of CO, Most of the studied emissions are located on the southwest boundary of Mt. Etna, near the town of Paterno. They consist of three mud volcanoes (known as Salinelle), one spring with bubbling gas (Acqua Grassa) and one area of diffuse degassing (Pescheria). Another site (Naftia Lake) with remarkable gas emissions (bubbling gas into a lake as well as adjacent areas of diffuse soil degassing) is located further southwest of Mt. Etna in an area of extinct Quaternary volcanism on the northwest margin of Hyblean Mts. In all of these areas the origin of the highest CO2 emissions is clearly magmatic, and degassing to the atmosphere occurs mostly through tectonic structures, probably at a regional scale. The magmatic source that feeds anomalous degassing in the above areas is likely to be the same that feeds volcanic activity at Mt. Etna. Focused degassing was measured at each emission vent using devices that measure the air speed, whereas diffuse soil degassing was measured using the accumulation chamber method. In total, 712 measurements were carried out (146 in focused degassing vents, 566 on diffuse degassing areas). Single CO2 output values ranged from 1.8 10(-5) to 1.68 kg s(-1). In the case of diffuse degassing areas, statistical analyses allowed to discriminate between biogenic CO2 and CO2 deriving from a magmatic-hydrothermal source. Only the efflux values from the latter source were considered in the output estimates. The total estimated output thus obtained was about 2.61 kg s(-1), relevant to a total surface of about 146,500 m(2) (which includes only the magmatic CO2 emissions). This value is comparable with that of most non-volcanic emissions from geothermal and/or faulted areas of central-southern Italy, as well with the CO2 output from some of the volcanic areas of Italy.

J	TREASURER, JW; OWEN, R; BOWERS, E				TREASURER, JW; OWEN, R; BOWERS, E			THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF PIKE, ESOX-LUCIUS, AND PERCH, PERCA-FLUVIATILIS, IN A SIMPLE PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEM	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The population dynamics and predator-prey relationship of pike, Esox lucius, and perch, Perca fluviatilis, were examined in simple fish communities in two adjacent shallow lakes, Lochs Kinord and Davan, Deeside, Scotland. Few perch survive to age 3 but Z is low for fish > 3 years and perch live up to 17 years. Population fecundity remained relatively high and constant in perch because of the multi-age spawning stock and the presence of older more fecund perch. Growth rates of perch in both lochs are relatively high as a consequence of low stock abundance. The N, B, and P of adult perch were unusually low. The age range of pike, and N, B, P, and growth were in the range of values reported elsewhere. There was little variation in the strength of pike year classes and the importance of cannibalism and low occurrence of alternative prey in the lochs suggest that the populations were self-regulating. Cannibalism by adults was responsible for most of mortality in perch larvae, and predation by pike and adult perch was responsible for the majority of juvenile losses. This conclusion is supported by the high biomass ratios of pike:juvenile perch of 1.0-30.8. While the number of adult fish was almost equal, the biomass of adult pike was 2-3 x that of perch in Kinord and 6 x in Davan. In L. Kinord, where year class strength was stable, high predation pressure from perch and pike reduced perch abundance rather than eliminated year classes. Perch year classes fluctuated in abundance in L. Davan and were eliminated in the first summer in two sampling years. The pike, and particularly the perch populations. have features characteristic of fish communities in unperturbed ecosystems: namely, a wide range of age classes, stability in biomass with variation dampened by longevity, and low production.

J	Hyatt, KD; Mathias, KL; McQueen, DJ; Mercer, B; Milligan, P; Rankin, DP				Hyatt, KD; Mathias, KL; McQueen, DJ; Mercer, B; Milligan, P; Rankin, DP			Evaluation of hatchery versus wild sockeye salmon fry growth and survival in two British Columbia lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the relative success of sockeye salmon hatchery fry stocking in two British Columbia-Alaska transboundary lakes (1,622-ha Tatsamenie Lake and 492-ha Tahltan Lake). Fry stocking began in the late 1980s and is still under way. During the study period, survival patterns in the two lakes were different. At Tatsamenie Lake, wild egg-to-fry survival was higher than hatchery egg-to-fry survival (11.3% versus 4.3%) and wild egg-to-smolt survival was higher than hatchery egg-to-smolt survival (5.8% versus 2.5%). We found no relationship between fry survival and stocking date, spawner abundance, or food availability in Tatsamenie Lake, but we did find a significant positive relationship between early-spring fry length and egg-to-fry survival. Also, we found that in net-pen experiments, larger fry survived better. From this, we concluded that hatchery fry stocked into Tatsamenie Lake may suffer from size-mediated mortality and that net-pen supplemental feeding could be used to overcome this problem. However, because eggs used for hatchery production come from the lake, fry stocking can only be justified when hatchery fry survival exceeds wild fry survival. At Tatsamenie Lake, this goal has not yet been attained. At Tahltan Lake, wild egg-to-fry survival was lower than hatchery egg-to-fry survival (1.5% versus 6.3%) and wild egg-to-smolt survival was lower than hatchery egg-to-smolt survival (3.6% versus 12.8%). Hatchery fry release date and food availability both failed to explain these differences in fry and smolt survival at Tahltan Lake. However, there was a strong negative relationship between total female escapement and wild egg-to-smolt survival. This supported the results of an earlier investigation, which suggested that Tahltan Lake was spawning-site limited. We concluded that at Tahltan Lake, hatchery fry stocking increased smolt numbers, is biologically justified, and should be continued.																			0275-5947					AUG	2005	25	3					745	762		10.1577/M03-230.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-230.1													WOS:000231336800001
J	Hammar, J				Hammar, J.			Natural resilience in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus: life history, spatial and dietary alterations along gradients of interspecific interactions	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus species complex has been shown to be exceptionally vulnerable to rapid abiotic and biotic changes. Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation.

J	Flinn, MB; Whiles, MR; Adams, SR; Garvey, JE				Flinn, MB; Whiles, MR; Adams, SR; Garvey, JE			Macroinvertebrate and zooplankton responses to emergent plant production in upper Mississippi River floodplain wetlands	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The upper Mississippi River is managed as a multiple use system, balancing the needs of industry, recreation, and navigation. Through water-level management (WLM), the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers manipulates water levels in some navigation pools to promote emergent vegetation for fish and wildlife in off-channel habitats. A manipulative experiment was conducted to assess responses of invertebrates to vegetation and associated organic matter associated with WLM in floodplain wetlands of Mississippi River navigation pool 25. Macroinvertebrate and zooplankton communities and benthic organic matter were compared in replicated paired plots consisting of experimentally de-vegetated and adjacent control plots. Hydrology was variable during the study, resulting in a strong vegetation response year (1999), a no response year (2000), and a moderate response year (2001). Differences in benthic organic matter between plot types were most pronounced in fall 2000, following the strong vegetation response year, where residual vegetation resulted in significantly higher total and coarse benthic organic matter in vegetated plots. Of the 2 years (2000, 2001) they were sampled, differences in macroinvertebrate communities were only evident in 2001 when there was a moderate vegetation response. Total macroinvertebrate densities during 2001 were similar between devegetated and vegetated plots, but responses of individual taxa varied. Total macroinvertebrate biomass was significantly higher in the vegetated plots during 2001. Of dominant groups, Oligochaeta biomass was significantly higher in vegetated plots, whereas total Chironomidae abundance and biomass were both significantly higher in devegetated plots. Community metrics reflected higher macroinvertebrate diversity in vegetated plots. Zooplankton were not abundant or diverse in plots, but total densities were significantly higher in vegetated plots during the 1999 strongest vegetation response year. Results demonstrate that WLM to enhance emergent vegetation in off-channel habitats of this large river influences organic matter dynamics and invertebrates. Although many groups responded positively to vegetation, responses varied with the degree of vegetation response and the taxonomic resolution of analyses, suggesting that hydrologic variability, and associated spatial and temporal variability in emergent vegetation, can enhance invertebrate diversity in floodplain wetland habitats.

J	Previant, WJ; Nagel, LM				Previant, Wilfred J.; Nagel, Linda M.			Vernal Pool Inventory and Classification at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Vernal pools occur in the glaciated forests of northeastern North America and provide critical breeding and foraging habitat for amphibian and mammal species. Protection for these ephemeral wetlands is not federally mandated, placing them at risk for habitat fragmentation and making them more vulnerable to impacts of climate change. Unlike the northeastern United States, limited information about vernal pools exists for the Great Lakes region, and there is a lack of information about techniques to identify and classify vernal pools using remote sensing and field surveys. At Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA, our objectives were to locate vernal pools using true-color, spring leaf-off aerial photography at the 1:12,000 scale, classify vernal pools using modified geomorphological classification systems, and determine landscape associations with soil series and cover type GIS datasets. From the 214 water features identified and categorized via aerial photography, two (water with canopy, water without canopy) of the 12 categories accounted for 91.5% of the pools. The park's 51 vernal pools had a density of 0.19 km(-2) and an average surface pool area of 1078.2 m(2) (+/- 387.6). Using basin morphology and geomorphology, vernal pools were divided into the following five classes: classic, complex, kettle-kame, dune-swale, and minor ponds. Vernal pools were associated with three soil series that were characterized by slopes less than 5%, poorly to very poorly drained soils, and a clay content less than 10%. Nearly three-quarters of the vernal pools occurred in the hemlock-hardwood cover type. The conservation and protection of these discrete and small ephemeral wetlands should be considered within a landscape context, as subsets of vernal pools have specific geomorphology, soil series, and cover type associations.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2016	36	2					124	136		10.3375/043.036.0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.036.0203													WOS:000377477000002

We take advantage of the long interest in aquatic plants in Denmark to compare the submerged flora in lakes and streams in 1896 and 1996. 2 Most of the lakes which contained a diverse submerged vegetation 100 years ago now have the high phytoplankton biomasses and summer transparencies below 2.0 m characteristic of eutrophication. The majority of 17 lakes included in both old and recent studies have lost all or most of their submerged species. Species richness for those lakes that were vegetated did not, however, differ significantly between old and recent studies. 3 Species richness declined markedly in the 13 streams included in both studies. Over all sites, there was also a significant decline of species richness per locality. Potamogeton species declined from 16 to 9, despite an 8-fold increase in the number of sites surveyed. 4 Similar compositions and rank-abundances of Potamogeton species in lakes and streams studied 100 years ago reflect suitable growth conditions and mutual exchange of propagules. Today, low habitat diversity and frequent disturbance in streams and low recruitment from lakes favours only robust, fast-growing species capable of regrowth following weed cutting and dredging. 5 A positive interspecific relationship observed in the contemporary stream vegetation between mean local abundance and number of occupied sites was probably promoted by redistribution of plants as a result of disturbance and efficient dispersal in the interconnected stream network. 6 The freshwater macrophyte flora in north-west Europe presently includes a high proportion of rare species which are threatened by extinction. Both species typical for oligotrophic conditions (e.g. P. filiformis and P. polygonifolius) and another group of large, slow-growing species (e.g. P. alpinus, P. lucens, P. praelongus and P. zosterifolius), were once common but are now infrequent, while other transient species have remained rare (e.g. P, acutifolius, P. colouratus, P. densus and P. rutilus). The presence of many species that barely survive in small and distant populations will make re-assembly of submerged aquatic communities difficult.					; Larsen, Søren/J-6754-2013; Larsen, Soren E./J-6754-2013; Riis, Tenna/AAE-4115-2020; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/F-3041-2015	Larsen, Soren Erik/0000-0001-8428-2065; Larsen, Soren E./0000-0003-4570-9489; Riis, Tenna/0000-0003-2501-4444; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/0000-0003-2534-4638													0022-0477					DEC	2000	88	6					1030	1040		10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00519.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00519.x													WOS:000166795700008

Some of these modifications are of special interest because they constitute reverse weathering reactions, rare in surface environments, and because there is not yet an accurate assessment of their global relevance in mineralogical and geochemical cycles. For this study, two sections from the Central System in Spain were selected. Both are sections through the Uppper Cenomanian-Turonian mixed clastic and carbonate succession, containing both calcite and dolomite, in the Sierra de Guadarrama. Mid-Turonian sea level fall resulted in the formation of a coastal plain environment in which extensive pedogenesis occurred around saline lagoons. The mineralogical changes that have occurred as a result of sedimentation in saline lagoons and as a consequence of pedogenesis are described. Textural relationships indicate that the dolomite cement pre-dates the calcite. Silicate minerals are represented by quartz, kaolinite, illite-smectite, illite, minor plagioclase and alkali feldspar, and trace chlorite and palygorskite. There is a positive correlation between the intensity of pedogenesis and the proportion of illite in the clay assemblage in one of the sections, indicating pedogenic illitisation. In this section, the intensity of the illitisation process increases up, reaching a maximum where pedogenesis is most intense in the middle part, and then decreases as marine influence increases towards the top of the Alcorlo Formation and the overlying marine Tranquera Formation. The clay assemblages are consistent with a slow transformation process from kaolinite to illite by way of illite-smectite, taking place under surface conditions. The illitisation process has resulted in a less Fe-rich, more Mg-, and Al-rich illite than the majority of previously documented cases in the near surface. Formation of Al-rich illite is not therefore restricted to the deep subsurface. The mechanism for low temperature illitisation involves enhanced layer charge resulting from Mg2+ substitution for Al3+ (or Fe3+) and Fe3+ to Fe2+ reduction. Mg2+ enrichment may have occurred principally in saline lagoons or lakes, while Fe3+ to Fe2+ reduction occurred as a result of wetting and drying in a pedogenic environment. So far as it has been possible to establish, this dual mechanism has not previously been documented. This study indicates clearly that the dolomite and calcite are authigenic cements that precipitated in a clastic sediment, probably soon after deposition. Dolomitisation and Mg enrichment of the clay may have occurred at the same time. Seawater is the most probable source of Mg. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ichinose, GA; Anderson, JG; Smith, KD; Zeng, YH				Ichinose, GA; Anderson, JG; Smith, KD; Zeng, YH			Source parameters of eastern California and western Nevada earthquakes from regional moment tensor inversion	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The moment tensors and centroid depths are estimated for eastern California and western Nevada earthquakes from regionally recorded long-period seismograms using the moment-tensor inversion method. We compiled the moment tensor solutions into a catalog complete for earthquakes with M-W > 4 since 1990. The earthquakes in this study are mostly located within the aftershock zones of Eureka Valley, Double Spring Flat, Coso, Ridgecrest, Fish Lake Valley, and Scotty's Junction, with the remaining earthquakes distributed across the region. We validated the moment tensor solutions by a comparison with Harvard centroid moment tensor (CMT) and P-wave first-motion focal mechanism solutions. The mean difference in strike, dip, and rake between our moment tensors and either Harvard CMT solutions or first-motion focal mechanisms were less than approximately 15degrees with a standard deviation less than 10degrees. We also examine the solution mean and variance by inverting resampled datasets using the delete-j Jackknife resampling method. Based on two well-recorded sample events, with more than 11 and 14 associated recording stations, the P- and T-axis trend and plunge can be determined to within +/-10degrees when at least three or four well-distributed stations are used in the inversion. We separated the T-axis trends based on the approximate boundaries for three tectonic regions: Sierra Nevada, Walker Lane-eastern California shear zone, and Basin and Range. Relative to the mean T-axis trend for the Sierra Nevada, the mean T-axis trend for the Walker Lane region is rotated clockwise by 25degrees and the mean T-axis trend for the Basin and Range is rotated clockwise by 40degrees. We separated the earthquakes into strike-slip and normal-slip focal mechanisms based on a simple rake angle criterion. About 70% of modern earthquakes and 73% of the 11 large historical earthquakes since 1860 are in the strike-slip category. The fraction of seismic moment released as strike-slip earthquakes is approximately 50% for modern earthquakes and 75% for historical earthquakes. The difference is well within the variability expected from short catalogs. These results emphasize the importance of the component of right-lateral shear within the region and are qualitatively consistent with recent geodetic results.

J	Lake, ET				Lake, Ethan T.			Crystallization and saturation front propagation in silicic magma chambers	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The cooling and crystallization style of silicic magma bodies in the upper crust falls on a continuum between whole-chamber processes of convection, crystal settling, and cumulate formation and interface-driven processes of conduction and crystallization front migration. In the end-member case of vigorous convection and crystal settling, volatile saturation advances downward from the roof and upward from the floor throughout the chamber. In the end-member case of stagnant magma bodies, volatile saturation occurs along an inward propagating front from all sides of the chamber. Ambient thermal gradient primarily controls the propagation rate; warm (>= 40 degrees C/km) geothermal gradients lead to thick (1200+ m) crystal mush zones and slow crystallization front propagation. Cold (<40 degrees C/km) geothermal gradients lead to rapid crystallization front propagation and thin (<1000 m) mush zones. Magma chamber geometry also exerts a first-order control on propagation rates; bodies with high surface to magma volume ratio and large Earth-surface-parallel faces exhibit more rapid propagation and thinner mush zones. Crystallization front propagation occurs at speeds of greater than 10 cm/yr (rhyolitic magma; 1 km thick sill geometry in a 20 degrees C/km geotherm), far faster than diffusion of volatiles in magma and faster than bubbles can nucleate, grow, and ascend through the chamber. Numerical simulations indicate saturation front propagation is determined primarily by pressure and magma crystallization rate; above certain initial water contents (4.4 wt.% in a dacite) the mobile magma is volatile-rich enough above 10 km depth to always contains a saturation front. Saturation fronts propagate down from the magma chamber roof at lower water contents (3.3 wt.% in a dacite at 5 km depth), creating an upper saturated interface for most common (4-6 wt.%) magma water contents. This upper interface promotes the production of a fluid pocket underneath the apex of the magma chamber. If the fluid pocket grew faster than rates of escape into the wall rock, fluid accumulation and hydro-fracturing could possibly trigger an eruption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Due to shallow light penetration, restricting the growth of phototrophic organisms, and large allochthonous organic carbon inputs from the catchment area, the lake metabolism is expected to be dominated by heterotrophic organisms. In this study, we test this assumption and show that the potential for autotrophic carbon fixation and internal carbon cycling is high throughout the water column. Further, we show that during the summer stratification carbon fixation can exceed respiration in a boreal lake even below the euphotic zone. Metagenome-assembled genomes and 16S profiling of a vertical transect of the lake revealed multiple organisms in an oxygen-depleted compartment belonging to novel or poorly characterized phyla. Many of these organisms were chemolithotrophic, potentially deriving their energy from reactions related to sulfur, iron, and nitrogen transformations. The community, as well as the functions, was stratified along the redox gradient. The autotrophic potential in the lake metagenome below the oxygenic zone was high, pointing toward a need for revising our concepts of internal carbon cycling in boreal lakes. Further, the importance of chemolithoautotrophy for the internal carbon cycling suggests that many predicted climate changeassociated fluctuations in the physical properties of the lake, such as altered mixing patterns, likely have consequences for the whole-lake metabolism even beyond the impact to the phototrophic community. IMPORTANCE Autotrophic organisms at the base of the food web are the only life form capable of turning inorganic carbon into the organic form, facilitating the survival of all other organisms. In certain environments, the autotrophic production is limited by environmental conditions and the food web is supported by external carbon inputs. One such environment is stratified boreal lakes, which are one of the biggest natural sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the boreal region. Thus, carbon cycling in these habitats is of utmost importance for the future climate. Here, we demonstrate a high potential for internal carbon cycling via phototrophic and novel chemolithotrophic organisms in the anoxic, poorly illuminated layers of a boreal lake. Our results significantly increase our knowledge on the microbial communities and their metabolic potential in oxygen-depleted freshwaters and help to understand and predict how climate change-induced alterations could impact the lake carbon dynamics.

For mass balances, especially for calculations of POM im- and export in certain areas, or for estimating the significance of aggregate formation in the context of organisms' removal from the euphotic zone, a potential sedimentation of organic particles preferably in combination with particle quality parameters influencing sinking velocity is needed. Sedimentation of POM can be measured by small scale laboratory experiments in settling tubes. We used different parameters that describe the quantity and quality of POM in combination with the SETCOL method. Sinking rates of POC from 3 different nearshore and inner coastal waters of the Southern Baltic Sea were low with 1-32 cm d(-1), but comparable to rates obtained from several phytoplankton species, e.g. diatoms, which are important parts of POM and have a similar size range compared to the particles investigated in this study. We did not find any correlation between the sinking rate and the quantity or quality of particulate organic matter. Obviously, the differences in organic matter composition of particles smaller than 200 mu m, investigated with this miniscale experimental method, did not affect the sinking rates considerably. Calculated from sinking rates and POC concentrations 19-1,430 mg C could sediment per squaremetre and day, if horizontal matter transfer and resuspension were ignored as it was done during the settling procedure. Concerning the application of the SETCOL method to plankton samples we must stress the importance of appropriate laboratory incubation conditions. Special attention has to be paid to an equal light climate and oxygen supply for the reference and settling vessels.																			1434-2944						2000	85	2-3					341	357																WOS:000087416900012

Local, regional and taxonomic factors influencing PCB bioaccumulation between two colonial waterbirds: non-migratory facultative vs migratory obligate piscivores	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Studies of legacy contaminants (e.g., PCBs) in wildlife typically focus on singular bioaccumulation mechanisms related to organism physiology, food web effects or environmental factors. However, several mechanisms may jointly determine chemical burdens of biomonitoring species making the interpretation of burdens a significant challenge. We used ecological tracers (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, fatty acids) to infer and compare major PCB bioaccumulation mechanisms in eggs of a non-migratory facultative piscivore and a migratory obligate piscivore - the herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the double-crested cormorant (Nannopterum auritum), respectively. We found stark differences between species in how PCBs accumulated at nine Laurentian Great Lakes sites from 2015 to 2018. Semi-precocial gulls accumulated 70 % more PCBs in their eggs compared to altricial cormorants, consistent with higher parental investment in lipid content. Site-specificity also varied, with nearly twofold more variation in per-lipid PCBs being site-linked in gulls (84 %) than in cormorants (47 %). Fatty acid and stable isotope profiles indicated gulls bioaccumulated more PCBs at more mesotrophic sites where they fed on aquatic over terrestrial resources. Cormorants, in contrast, bioaccumulated more PCBs in oligotrophic lakes where, potentially, mixotrophic food webs may lead to high bioconcentration. Higher bioaccumulation of PCBs occurred in cormorants during winters with earlier ice-in dates, raising possibilities of PCB subsidy from overwintering grounds or metabolic effects. The potential variety of life history, ecological and geographic influences on egg PCB burdens underscores the importance of accounting for these in biomonitoring species as tissue burdens may have complex origin.						de Solla, Shane/0000-0002-8491-4285													0013-9351	1096-0953				JUL 15	2025	277								121565	10.1016/j.envres.2025.121565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121565		APR 2025						40203984					WOS:001475293700001

Initial investigations in 1999 suggested that Hogarth contained little aquatic life and standard LC50 toxicity tests showed that Hogarth was acutely toxic to Daphnia magna. By 2004, Hogarth no longer exhibited acute toxicity, but using Ceriodaphnia dubia as an indicator species was shown to have chronic toxicity during winter months. Toxicity indicator evaluations (TIE) revealed that the most likely cause was elevated SO42-, Ca2+, and Mg2+. In 2006, Lemna minor demonstrated a toxic response to Hogarth water and this organism was used to predict the toxic effect once the two pits join. Water from the hypolimnion and epilimnion of Hogarth was serially diluted with water from the hypolimnion and epilimnion of Caland to mimic the actual predicted mixing of the two pit lakes. A similar dilution series using water extracted from columns containing rock mixtures at amounts found in the two pit lakes was also tested for toxicity. The standard IC25 procedure for Lemna sp. of frond counts did not work although visually the fronds in treatments containing more than 50% of Hogarth water appeared smaller and had chlorotic areas. Using dry weight as a covariate, an ANCOVA of chlorophyll content showed a significant reduction in concentration with added Hogarth or Caland hypolimnion water. The best indicator of toxicity was surface area of the fronds which demonstrated conclusively the adverse effects of both added Hogarth water from any depth and Caland hypolimnion water. Given the depth regimes in the pit lakes, toxicity was predicted to continue after the pits joined.																					978-1-897009-47-5				2010							343	346																WOS:000323234800078
J	Wells, JT; Scholz, CA; Soreghan, MJ				Wells, JT; Scholz, CA; Soreghan, MJ			Processes of sedimentation on a lacustrine border-fault margin: Interpretation of cores from Lake Malawi, East Africa	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Large lakes are attractive research sites because they provide ideal spatial scales for understanding the complex relationships between facies distributions and processes of sedimentation. In this paper, we describe deepwater facies and associated environments of deposition, based primarily on cores, from the tectonically active South Rukuru sublacustrine fan system of Lake Malawi, east Africa, where river discharge is high, offshore gradients are steep, and gravity-driven processes are common. The coring program was tied to a simultaneous seismic investigation, which is discussed in a companion paper (Soreghan et al, 1999). All facies, except the hemipelagic drape, contain widespread evidence of gravity-driven sedimentation processes, with turbidity currents being responsible for most of the sediment transport and deposition, Multiple fining-up turbidite units dominate the sandy facies of the canyons, channels, mouth-of-canyon fans, and basin-plain fill environments, and thin distal turbidites are present in cores through most of the muddier facies, Angular gravel and coarse sand are com mon not only throughout the canyons of the sloping relay ramp region but also as far offshore as the main axial channel and its depocenter, the basin plain fill facies, Turbidites range in thickness from 0.25 to 2.0 m, are usually stacked, and can be recognized by well-defined Bouma sequences. A hemipelagic drape of highly laminated to structureless mud, which forms an uneven blanket over much of the lake bottom, is commonly interspersed with turbidites, Because lake levels can change rapidly as a result of climatic variations, the rate of sediment mobilization is extremely fast relative to marine systems. Vertical excursions in lake level of 100 m over only a few hundred years may lessen the distinctions between highstand and lowstand deposits. The border-fault setting allows coarse sediment to be delivered to the steep offshore, even during periods of lake highstand, However, during periods of falling and low lake level it is likely that downcutting and erosion of highstand deltas increase the magnitude and intensity of turbidite deposition in the mouth-of-canyon fan and in the basin-plain fill environments.

Previous investigations on the immunotoxic effects of PCBs and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in developing avian embryos were undertaken with embryos exposed only during the latter stager of incubation. To simulate exposure in embryos in the wild, chicken eggs were injected with PCB 126 (sunflower oil carrier) into the air cell before initiation of incubation. It was hypothesized that exposure to PCB 126 during the complete incubation period would decrease immune organ masses and lymphocyte numbers. Doses of PCB 126 ranged from 0.051 to 0.80 ng/g egg. Control groups consisted of carrier-injected and noninjected eggs. The thymus and bursa of Fabricius were removed and weighed on d 20 of incubation (1 d before hatch). The immune organs were homogenized, and viable lymphoid cells were counted using the trypan blue exclusion method. Probit analysis estimated the LD20 to be 0.21 ng/g and the LD50 to be 1.01 ng/g. Thymus mass dropped sharply between 0.13 and 0.32 ng/g, and lymphoid cell numbers in the thymus fell sharply between 0.051 and 0.13 ng/g. Bursa mass began to decrease at the lowest dose of 0.051 ng/g and reached a minimum at 0.32 ng/g. The number of viable cells decreased slightly at 0.051 ng/g and reached a minimum at the 0.13- and 0.32-ng/g doses, in general, lymphoid cell numbers were more sensitive to PCB 126 than organ masses, and the bursa tended to be more sensitive than the thymus. Doses necessary to reduce the number of viable lymphoid cells in the thymus and bursa were at least one order of magnitude lower with full-term incubation as compared to exposure only during later stages of incubation.																			1528-7394	1087-2620				OCT 29	1999	58	4					233	244		10.1080/009841099157313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/009841099157313								10591490					WOS:000083474800004
J	Gilbert, R; Crookshanks, S				Gilbert, Robert; Crookshanks, Sarah			Sediment waves in a modern high-energy glacilacustrine environment	SEDIMENTOLOGY												A 4.7 km(2) field of sediment waves occurs in front of the Slims River delta in Kluane Lake, the largest lake in the Yukon Territory. Slims River heads in the Kaskawulsh Glacier, part of the St Elias Ice Field and discharges up to 400 m(3) s(-1) of water with suspended sediment concentrations of up to 7 g l(-1). The 19 km long sandur of Slims River was created in the past 400 years since Kaskawulsh Glacier advanced and dammed the lake and the sandur has advanced into Kluane Lake at an average rate of 48 m a(-1). However, this rate is decreasing as flow is diverted from Slims River because of the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier. The sandur and a road constructed on the delta remove coarse-grained sediment, so the river delivers dominantly mud to the lake. Inflow during summer generates quasi-continuous turbidity currents with velocities up to 0.6 m s(-1). The front of the delta consists of a plane surface sloping lakeward at 0.0188 (1.08 degrees). A field of sediment waves averaging 130 m in length and 2.3 m in amplitude has developed on this surface. Slopes on the waves vary from -0.067 (-3.83 degrees, i.e. sloping in the opposite direction to the regional slope) to 0.135 (7.69 degrees). The internal structure of the sediment waves, as documented by seismic profiling, shows that sedimentation on the stoss portion of the wave averages 2.7 times that on the lee portion. Rates of sediment accumulation in the wave field are about 0.3 m a(-1), so these lacustrine waves have formed in a much shorter period of time (less than 200 years) and are advancing upslope towards the delta much more quickly (1 to 2 m a(-1)) than typical marine sediment waves. These waves formed on the flat surface of the lake floor, apparently in the absence of pre-existing forms, and they are altered and destroyed as the wave field advances and the characteristics of the turbidity currents change.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				APR	2009	56	3					645	659		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00990.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00990.x													WOS:000264029100003

Based on the cyclization ratio index (CBT) of the brGDGTs, and using different terrestrial and lacustrine CBT-pH empirical relationships, the reconstructed pH records over the past ca. 15 ka exhibited similar trends of variation, although the absolute pH values were different. In order to better understand the reconstructed pH record, samples of surface soils from the dust source area and the catchment of Gonghai Lake, as well as surface sediments from the lake, were collected for instrumental pH measurements and modern brGDGT analysis. The instrumental pH results demonstrated that the surface soils from the dust source area were alkaline, while those from the catchment of Gonghai Lake were acidic. In addition, the instrumental pH results for the surface sediments from the lake were slightly alkaline and the corresponding pH values were intermediate between those of the two surface soil source groups. This may reflect the effect of the input of material from different sources on the sedimentary pH record. However, the results from modern brGDGTs in some of the surface soils and surface sediment samples demonstrate that brGDGTs in the core sediments from Gonghai Lake are predominantly of aquatic origin. Therefore, the CBT-derived pH record over the past ca. 15 ka from the lake can be interpreted as a record of the lake water pH history, which is consistent with the carbonate content record from a parallel core from the same lake. In addition, using the modern lacustrine calibration, the CBT-derived pH values for surface sediments of Gonghai Lake are consistent with instrumental modern lake water pH values for the lake. Further comparison indicates that the lake water pH is controlled mainly by the degree of humidity of the local climate, which is closely related to the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM); therefore, the pH record can be used as an indicator of EASM intensity. Our results demonstrate that, on the basis of careful analysis of its origins, the CBT index of aquatic brGDGTs can be used for lake water pH reconstruction and subsequent paleoclimate reconstruction, and that in north China, the lake water pH is controlled mainly by the degree of humidity of the local climate.

Holocene palaeoclimate and sea level fluctuation recorded from the coastal Barker Swamp, Rottnest Island, south-western Western Australia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Holocene palaeoclimatic history of south-western Western Australia (SWWA) has received little attention compared to south-eastern Australia, and this has resulted in conflicting views over the impact of climate variability in the region. We present here a well-dated, high-resolution record from two overlapping sediment cores obtained from the centre of Barker Swamp, Rottnest Island, offshore Perth. The records span the last 8.7 ka, with the main lacustrine phase occurring after 7.4 ka. This site preserves both pollen and several ostracod taxa. The pollen record suggests a long-term shift from the early-mid Holocene to the late Holocene to drier conditions with less shrubland and more low-ground cover and less fire activity. A salinity transfer function was developed from ostracod faunal assemblage data and trace metal ratios (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Na/Ca) and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13) analysed on selected ostracod valves. These provide a detailed history of evaporation/precipitation (E/P) differences that clearly shows that the SWWA region was subjected to significant climatic shifts over the last 7.4 ka, with a broad shift towards increased aridity after 5 ka. The swamp ranged from fresh to saline as recorded in the ostracod valve chemistry and the independently-derived salinity transfer function. The ostracod record also indicates that a sea-level highstand occurred between ca. 4.5 and 4.3 ka, with probable step-wise increases at 6.75, 6.2, and 5.6 ka, with the last vestiges of salt water intrusion at ca. 1 ka. After about 2.3 ka, the fresh, groundwater lens that underlies the western portion of the island intersected the swamp depression, influencing the hydrology of the swamp. The broad climatic changes recorded in Barker Swamp are also compared with data from southern South Africa, and it is suggested that the Southern Annular Mode appears to have been the dominant driver in the climate of these regions and that the Indian Ocean Dipole is of little importance in the southern regions of the south-western Cape of Africa and south-western Western Australia					; Chase, Brian/A-1202-2010; Gouramanis, Chris/AAP-3165-2020; Wilkins, Daniel/AAF-3959-2020	Wilkins, Daniel/0000-0003-2081-483X; Chase, Brian/0000-0001-6987-1291; Gouramanis, Chris/0000-0003-2867-2258; 													0277-3791					OCT 26	2012	54				SI		40	57		10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.05.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.05.007													WOS:000310948100005

As reported earlier, the sediments of the lake are finely laminated. The seven cores, recovered up to 30 km apart in the main lake basin, presented sediment sequences which correlate well with respect to ash layers and prominent colour changes, but also lamina for lamina. Here we report on the detailed evaluation of this record, which is varved continuously back to 14,570 yr B.P. (calendar years before 1950 AD). It is independent of C-14 calibration, i.e. it is not a Boating record, and it is the only detailed varve chronology known from the semi-arid Mediterranean region. Important Late Glacial events, such as the termination of the Oldest and Younger Dryas are clearly recorded in the sediments. Chronozones were defined on the basis of changes of the deposition rate and of chemical composition caused by environmental changes. Analysis of the annual deposition rates revealed abrupt changes within only a few years, declining for example by approximately 30% in the transition period between the Oldest Dryas and the Boiling. In most cases, alterations observed in the sedimentation rates are reflected in changes of the geochemical parameters, such as organic and inorganic carbon, opal, and the major elements Si, Ca, Mg, Al. Our results and palynological studies, performed on material recovered in an earlier expedition, are used to reconstruct palaeoenviromental conditions. In this study, the termination of the Younger Dryas is dated to 10,920 +/- 132 yr B.P. This is younger than the recently published Greenland ice core dates but in accordance with, for example, the central European dendrochronology. We suspect, that higher sediment deposition rates during the cold periods are due to rapid melting and intense wash out of soil, which was fairly loose because of sparse vegetation. This would lead to higher river discharges.

In the past 100 years, the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas have been retreating slowly. Since the 1990s, however, the state of glaciers has undergone abnormal changes. Compared with the data derived from the First Chinese Glacier Inventory (CGI) (1960s-1980s), the glacier volume in China decreased by approximately 20% and the glacier area was reduced by approximately 17.7%, based on the data derived from the Second CGI. In particular, the glacier mass loss of the small glaciers was characterized by an area less than 1 km(2) and was more intensive than that of lager glaciers. Abnormal changes in the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding areas are mainly reflected by the spatial pattern. Through the systematic analysis of the data on glacier area, terminal position, and mass balance changes, it was found that the glacier changes in the region experienced obvious spatial heterogeneity from 1990 to 2010. The "Karakoram glacier anomaly" in the eastern Pamir, Karakoram, and western Kunlun regions has exhibited slight mass stability or even glacier advance. However, the glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau experienced the most intensive and accelerated shrinkage. On the evaluated timescale, the state of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings has undergone abnormal changes regarding the loss rate of glacier volume. In the past 50 years, most of the glaciers have had a negative mass balance. Moreover, the mass loss process has intensified, especially since the 1990s. It is estimated that the loss rate of glacier volume from the Tibetan Plateau was as large as -15.6 +/- 10.1 Gt/a between 2003 and 2009. In addition to the abnormal changes in spatial patterns and temporal changes, the glaciers exhibited an abnormal change within the glacial system. The most significant variability within the glacier system was the abnormal change in the structure of glacier ice. Another abnormal change within the glacier system was that the glaciers showed a sustained slowdown concomitant with ice thinning. Abnormal warming at high altitudes is an important driver of abnormal changes in glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings. Moreover, these contrasting glacier behaviors on the Tibetan Plateau and surroundings are related to atmospheric circulation processes, especially interactions between the westerlies and the Indian Summer Monsoon. In addition, changes in glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings are closely related to the enhancement of human activities. The South Asian region on the southern slope of the Himalayas acts as a main source of severe anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially that of black carbon. The black carbon transported from South Asia to the glaciers reduces the glacier's albedo and thus accelerates glacier melting. As global warming intensifies, the abnormal glacier status will likely lead to more hazards, such as ice collapse and glacial lake outburst floods. To reduce the potential glacial risks on the Tibetan Plateau and surroundings, it is necessary to further strengthen the abilities of glacier monitoring and disaster prevention.

The water chemistry data show that all oilfield brines are CaCl2 type. They were enriched in Ca2+, B3+, Li+, Sr2+, B-r-, and were depleted in Mg2+, SO42-, which indicated that these brines had the characteristics of deeply circulated water. The relationship between delta D and delta 18O shows that all data of these brines decline towards the Global Meteoric Water Line (GWL) and Qaidam Meteoric Water Line (QWL), and that the intersection between oilfield brines and Meteoric Water Lines was close to the local spring and fresh water in the piedmont in the western Qaidam Basin. The results suggest that oilfield brines has initially originated from meteoric water, and then might be affected by water-rock metamorphose, because most oilfield brines distribute in the range of metamorphosing water. The Sr-87/Sr-86 values of most oilfield brines range from 0.71121 to 0.71194, and was less than that in salt lake water (> 0.712), but close to that of halite in the study area. These imply that salt dissolution occurred in the process of migration. In addition, all oilfield brines have obviously much positive d34S values (ranging from 26.46% to 54.57%) than that of salt lake brines, which was caused by bacterial sulfate reduction resulting in positive shift of d34S value and depleteed SO(4)(2-)in oilfield brines. Combined with water chemical data and delta D, delta O-18, Sr-87/Sr-86, delta S-34 values, we concluded that oilfield brines mainly originate from the deeply circulated meteoric waters, and then are affected by salt dissolution, water-rock metamorphose, sulfate reduction and dolomitization during the process of migration. These processes alter the chemical compositions of oilfield brines and accumulate rich elements (such as B, Li, Sr, Br, K and so on) for sustainable utilization of salt lake resources in the Qaidam Basin.					; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024; Tan, Hongbing/AFW-6778-2022	Lai, Zhongping/0000-0002-0139-9346; 													2096-0956	2365-7499				DEC	2010	29	4					446	454		10.1007/s11631-010-0478-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11631-010-0478-y													WOS:000218321000014

Historical archives, published data sets and lake sediments from the North and South Basins of Windermere were analysed to reconstruct changes in the lake and catchment since 1850 and determine the drivers of limnological variability. 2. Pastoral sheep farming has remained the dominant form of agriculture since 1850, but there was a decline in horse numbers (because of agricultural mechanisation), an increase in nitrogen fertiliser use and a doubling in sheep numbers since the 1950s. The human population in the Windermere catchment almost quadrupled between 1801 and 1921 coincident with the arrival of the railway in 1847, which led to urban expansion, sewer and piped water installation (since similar to 1860s) and the development of sewage treatment systems (after 1886). 3. C : N ratios and stable isotopes of carbon in 210 Pb-dated sediment cores suggested that land disturbance increased the transport of terrestrial carbon to sediments of both basins after 1870, but algae increasingly contributed to the sediment matrix after similar to 1890. Nitrogen-stable isotope ratios generally declined in both basins consistent with an increase in an isotopically light source such as atmospheric N deposition or synthetic fertilisers. 4. Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in sediment cores showed that algal production increased gradually in the North Basin from similar to 1890 to 1940 to be maintained at higher abundance thereafter. South Basin pigments changed most markedly similar to 1860 (increase in cyanobacterial pigments), similar to 1945 (increase in siliceous algal and chlorophyte pigments) and similar to 1987 (increase in cyanobacterial pigments). 5. Redundancy and variance partitioning analyses suggested that sewage influx and the modernisation of agriculture were strongly and positively correlated with algal abundance. However, climate variables were a secondary driver of algal change in both lake basins. 6. Enrichment of the lake was caused by a combination of increases in population (after 1847), more efficient sewage disposal, intensification of agriculture and atmospheric deposition of N, which led to a greater than fivefold increase in primary production in the North Basin and marked shifts in algal communities of the South Basin. 7. After enrichment, lake phytoplankton responded markedly to fluctuations in climate. High precipitation in January-March led to lower abundance of siliceous algae (mostly Asterionella formosa) in both lake basins, possibly because A. formosa inocula were diluted, thus limiting the spring diatom bloom. 8. This combined palaeolimnological and archival study has shown that eutrophication of Windermere occurred before the start of the lake monitoring programme in 1945, but that nutrient enrichment enhanced the lake response to meteorological change. Therefore, future management					Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022; Pates, Jacqueline/A-4910-2009	Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2012	57	2					260	277		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02689.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02689.x													WOS:000298786200003

The research site is located at the exit of the valley combined with desert, lake, and the Yellow River, which result in the diurnal variation and inconsistency of three types of PBL. Convective boundary layer (CBL) reaches 3,500 m in daytime while the top of stable boundary layer (SBL) reaches 1,500 m at night. The depth of surface layer, mixing layer (ML), residual layer (RL), entrainment zone (EZ), and temperature inversion are closely correlated with diurnal temperature variation. Substantial variability in CBL and SBL heights up to hundreds of meters was observed in high spatiotemporal resolution. Dynamic PBL representing dynamic stability from Ri fluctuates around 1,000 m during nighttime and rises to about 1,500 m during daytime. Material PBL, representing the distribution of atmospheric substances driven by solar heating, is classified into residual height of material boundary layer and accumulation height of material boundary layer to describe the capacity of dispersion and accumulation affected by CBL and SBL, respectively. Material PBL demonstrates similar trends to the thermal PBL in the daytime ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 m and shows similar variation with dynamic PBL in the nighttime due to orographic winds. This study emphasizes the differences among various kinds of PBL and importance of high resolution in meso-micro scale study of PBL researches.

Quantifying C flux is crucial for learning C cycling, but is challenging due to its complex cycling and significant impacts from intensive human activities. Here, we developed a process-based model (CDP) to achieve a daily estimation of C dynamics in agricultural ponds within lowland artificial watersheds (polders), and proposed a dual evaluation approach (concentration and flux) to assess the model's performance using two data sets obtained from eight typical polders in the Lake Taihu Basin. The developed model captured pond C dynamics, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.44 +/- 0.27. Our C flux estimations based on the newly-developed model showed large C emissions, primarily through carbon dioxide (CO2) (497.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), along with significant C burial (27.8 g C m(-2 )yr(-1)) with a hot moment in summer. Scenario simulations revealed the distinct impacts of pond C emissions and burial associated with the growth and death of phytoplankton and macrophytes. A 10% increase in macrophyte growth rates associated with a 1.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) increase in CO(2 )emission, while a similar increase in phytoplankton growth rates related to a 12.2-16.2% increase in C burial. This study revealed a quick response of C flux to phytoplankton-macrophyte dominance, and highlighted the high potential of the process-based model for high-resolution (daily) quantification of C fluxes, thereby enhancing our understanding of C cycling in lowland agricultural ponds.

Particularly, M. lutarioriparius, a species within the Miscanthus genus, stands out as the most suitable for application. This study focuses on the impact of harvest timing on the biomass and combustion quality of M. lutarioriparius in the coastal wetlands of Dongting Lake, Hunan. A comprehensive field experiment was conducted in this area. The findings reveal several key trends: Firstly, the biomass yield of M. lutarioriparius decreased from 18.42 tons per hectare to 11.25 tons per hectare with the delayed harvest. there is a notable increase in the stem-to-leaf ratio of M. lutarioriparius, primarily attributed to leaf shedding. Secondly, the water content had dropped to 22.33% by the time of harvest in February of the following year. Ash content decreased from 4.55% to 2.17% from October to February of the following year. The calorific value, cellulose and lignin content increased with delayed harvest, while hemicellulose content decreased. Notably, the calorific value exhibits a significant positive correlation with cellulose and lignin content, and a markedly negative correlation with hemicellulose. Thirdly, most mineral elements in the plant demonstrate a significant decrease with delayed harvesting, except for potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), which initially increase and then decrease. The ash content shows a positive correlation with the contents of potassium (K) and silicon (Si). Despite a reduction in biomass yield due to delayed harvesting, combustion quality significantly improves. Therefore, it is concluded that optimal fuel quality is achieved when M. lutarioriparius is harvested in February of the following year.

Here, we hypothesize that the proportion of metabolically active cells increases systematically along gradients of enrichment, and to test this hypothesis the number and proportion of metabolically active planktonic bacteria were investigated during the summer in a set of 24 temperate lakes, which span a considerable range in productivity. The tetrazolium salt 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) was used as an indicator of cells with an active electron transport system. The total number of bacteria ranged from 1.88 x 10(6) to 7.70 x 10(6) ml(-1), whereas the number of active cells was more variable and ranged from 0.37 x 10(6) to 2.18 x 10(6) ml(-1) in the study lakes. The proportion of metabolically active cells ranged from 15 to 33%, and tended to increase with nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations, but not with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Data on the number of total and active bacteria culled from the literature for marine, estuarine and freshwater systems show that the trends we measured in lakes are valid for pelagic systems in general. Over a broad range of aquatic systems, the total number of bacteria varied by three orders of magnitude, whereas the number of active bacteria varied by four orders of magnitude as system productivity increased. The proportion of active cells increased from ultraoligotrophic open-ocean areas (<5%) to highly productive estuaries (>50%). Our results suggest that in most aquatic systems there is a pool of rapidly growing cells, embedded in a usually larger matrix of inactive bacteria, and that the relative size of the active and inactive pools varies systematically among bacterial populations along gradients of enrichment.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0142-7873					OCT	1995	17	10					1905	1924																WOS:A1995TD91600003

Assessing transport timescales in Lake Huron's Hammond Bay: The crucial role of the Straits of Mackinac's exchange flows	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The oscillating bidirectional exchange flows between Lakes Michigan and Huron in the Straits of Mackinac generate complex hydrodynamics and the exchange flows are known to alter hydrodynamics in regions as far down as 50-60 km from the Straits modulating physical, chemical, and biological processes in the region. Although previous research examined the effects of exchange flows on hydrodynamics, their impacts on transport time scales, including residence and flushing times, have not been quantified. We used observations and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate bidirectional exchange flows in the Straits and their effects on hydrodynamics, temperature, and transport timescales in the Hammond Bay area, Lake Huron for the summers of 2018 and 2019. Comparisons with field observations showed that hydrodynamics can only be accurately described when the bidirectional flows are included in the modeling of the bays close to the Straits. Spectral analysis showed that the exchange flows play an important role in controlling conservative solute transport in bays close to the Straits. The residence time in the Hammond Bay area was calculated using a dye release approach with (without) the effects of bidirectional exchange flows producing estimates of 9.87 (16.00) and 13.75 (23.62) days for years 2018 and 2019 respectively based on a combined model of the two lakes and a model of Lake Huron only. Similarly, flushing times in the Hammond Bay area were estimated as 12.14 (14.38) and 8.96 (10.80) days for 2018 and 2019, respectively with (without) the exchange flows. Ignoring the exchange flows in the Straits was found to overestimate the residence time and flushing time in the Hammond Bay area by roughly 74 and 20 %, respectively. These results highlight the importance of including the bidirectional ex-change flows in biophysical models of bays in Lake Huron closer to the Straits and in similar systems elsewhere.

J	Hammond, D; Ferris, G				Hammond, David; Ferris, Gavin			Low doses of Earth Tec QZ ionic copper used in effort to eradicate quagga mussels from an entire Pennsylvania lake	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												A liquid formulation of acid-stabilized ionic copper called EarthTec QZ was used in an effort to eradicate invasive quagga mussels (Dreissena rosirifinmis bugensis) from an entire 12-hectare lake in Pennsylvania in fall of 2017. The treatment consisted of three separate applications of ionic copper delivered over a period of 37 days with the intent to minimize likelihood of spreading invasive mussels during a one-time water transfer event planned for later that year, from the treated lake to an adjacent river. Mussel mortality was estimated through use of caged adult mussels that were suspended at different locations and depths throughout the lake. Adult mussels began to die within 3 days of the initiation of treatment, particularly in the top 6 meters of the water body. The death of the last caged mussel was confirmed 40 days after the initiation of treatment. in a cage that had been placed in the metalimnion at a depth of 9 meters below the surface. Both biological and physicochemical data collected during the treatment period revealed that there was a pronounced thermocline at 8-11 meters depth. The layer of water in the thermocline resisted mixing, suggesting an explanation for why mussels located above and below this metalimnion were eradicated quickly, yet those within the metalimnion required targeted treatment techniques and 40 days to succumb to 100% mortality. Visual inspection of the shoreline after partial pump-down of the quarry in early November revealed high densities of empty shells from dead adults, and no live adults were found. Analysis of eDNA samples taken in December of 2017 and again in July 2018 concluded no mussel eDNA was detectable. Plankton tows collected and analyzed by microscopy in July, August and September 2018 were rich with zooplankton but no live mussel veligers were found. The cumulative stun of product applied throughout the entire course of treatment totaled 13,500 liters, which is equivalent to 0.44 mg/L as copper as calculated on the full volume of the lake - noteworthy because it is less than half the concentration EPA allows (1.0 mg/L) in a single algaecide treatment. This experience illustrates that low doses of acid-stabilized ionic copper can have profound effects on invasive mussel populations and are a viable management tool. If future sampling confirms that this eradication effort was successful, it will be the first recorded instance of eradicating quagga mussels from an entire lake.

The influence of Holocene tree-line advance and retreat on an arctic lake ecosystem: a multi-proxy study from Kharinei Lake, North Eastern European Russia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A consequence of predicted climate warming will be tree-line advance over large areas of the Russian tundra. Palaeolimnological techniques can be used to provide analogues of how such changes in tree-line advance and subsequent retreat affected lake ecosystems in the past. A Holocene sediment core taken from Kharinei Lake (Russia) was dated radiometrically and used for multi-proxy analyses with the aim of determining how climate and tree-line dynamics affected the productivity, community structure, carbon cycling and light regime in the lake. Pollen and macrofossil analyses were used to determine the dates of the arrival and retreat of birch and spruce forest. C:N ratios and percent loss-on-ignition were used to infer past changes in sediment organic matter. Visible-near-infrared spectroscopy and diatom analysis were used to infer past changes in lake-water carbon. Algal pigments and aquatic macrophytes were used to determine changes in lake productivity and light. Chironomids together with remains of the aquatic flora and fauna were used to provide information on past July temperature and continentality. Lake sedimentation was initiated shortly before 11,000 cal. years BP, when both chironomid- and pollen-inferred temperature reconstructions suggest higher summer temperatures than present, between 1 and 2 degrees C warmer, and lake productivity was relatively high. A few trees were already present at this time. The spruce forest expanded at 8,000 cal. year BP remaining in the vicinity of the lake until 3,500 cal. year BP. This period coincided with a high concentration of organic material in the water column, and relatively high benthic productivity, as indicated by a high benthic: planktonic diatom ratio. After tree-line retreat, the optical transparency of the lake increased, and it became more open and exposed, and was thus subject to greater water-column mixing resulting in a higher abundance of diatom phytoplankton, especially heavily silicified Aulocoseira species. The colder climate resulted in a shorter ice-free period, the lake was less productive and there was a loss of aquatic macrophytes. Increased wind-induced mixing following forest retreat had a greater influence on the lake ecosystem than the effects of decreasing organic matter concentration and increased light penetration.					; McGowan, Suzanne/GZB-0118-2022; Solovieva, Nadia/R-8946-2018	Salonen, Sakari/0000-0002-8847-9081; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Solovieva, Nadia/0000-0002-8978-9057													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2011	46	1					123	137		10.1007/s10933-011-9528-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9528-7													WOS:000293144700010

Geochronology of a long Pleistocene sequence at Kilombe volcano, Kenya: from the Oldowan to Middle Stone Age	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												We report a newly extended stratigraphic sequence with associated Palaeolithic sites from the area of the extinct Kilombe volcano in central Kenya. The extended archaeological sequence runs from Oldowan finds, through the Acheulean, and up to the Middle Stone Age. The sedimentary sequences within the Kilombe caldera and south flanks of the mountain have been dated through 40Ar/39Ar measurements and palaeomagnetic studies. A series of 40Ar/39Ar values date the geological sequence from 2.493 +/- 0.095 Ma, near the beginning of the Lower Pleistocene, through to 0.118 +/- 0.030 Ma near the Middle to Upper Pleistocene transition. It includes the first entirely new area of Oldowan localities in East Africa south of Ethiopia for thirty years, and the first in a rugged mountainous setting. Trachyte lavas of Kilombe mountain were extruded during and after c. 2.5 Ma, followed by formation of a caldera and subsequent caldera lake, and sedimentation of a sequence of tuffs, diamictites, sandstones, and claystones. Sections in the mid-part of this intra-caldera fill-sequence have produced dates of 1.8-1.7 Ma, associated with an Oldowan industry and fauna dated precisely at 1.814 +/- 0.004, and overlain by Acheulean finds at higher level. On the southern outward flanks of Kilombe mountain, a second major sequence is bounded at the base by trachyphonolite and a tuff yielding dates in the range 1.58-1.50 Ma. The main Acheulean archaeological site (GqJh1) falls within the overlying sedimentary sequence and has an age of c. 1.0 Ma, on the basis of a new 40Ar/39Ar date for the Three-Banded Tuff and palaeomagnetic reversal stratigraphy. Further 40Ar/39Ar dates indicate an age of c. 0.48-0.46 Ma for a marker ashflow tuff (AFT), prominent across the area. At Moricho, west of Kilombe, sediments above the AFT have been dated in the range 270,000-120,000 years and are associated with Middle Stone Age assemblages. In total, these sites attest to hominin activity from an Oldowan horizon dated to 1.8 Ma up to Later Stone Age stone scatters within the last 100,000 years.

J	Narama, C				Narama, Chiyuki			Overview of Recent Studies on Glacial Chronology: Examples from the Southern Hemisphere and Asian Mountains	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												Establishment of a continuous, detailed glacial chronology based on radiocarbon (C-14) dating has been hindered by the difficulty of collecting organic matter in cold and arid mountainous regions. The development of other numerical dating methods, such as terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, has recently made it possible to establish a detailed glacial chronology and to compare local glacial chronologies with recent climate proxy data of ice cores obtained from polar and alpine glaciers, and of deposits from sea floors and lake bottoms. This paper reviews recent studies on the glacial chronology of the Southern Hemisphere and high mountains of Asia (Himalayas, Tibet, and Central Asia). There are three main outcomes. (1) Glacial advances from the Late Glacial to Holocene in New Zealand and Patagonia were mostly synchronized with cold periods identified in Antarctic ice cores, while glaciers in the Peru Andes fluctuated oppositely but similarly to the North Atlantic. (2) Differences and similarities between local glacial chronologies in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau originated from the Indian monsoon and westerlies. For example, some researchers have proposed that the presence of early Holocene moraines and absence of moraines deposited in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) indicate an enhanced monsoon in the early Holocene because a stronger summer monsoon brings more snow to the Himalayan ranges. (3) The glacial chronologies during the Last Glacial in Central Asia, which is not influenced by the Indian monsoon, differ from those in the Himalayas. The glacier changes agree with climate proxy records from lacustrine deposits and mountain ice cores in Central Asia during the last 1000 years, which indicates the change of precipitation in the area.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2012	121	2			SI		215	234		10.5026/jgeography.121.215	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.121.215													WOS:000446272600003
J	Kida, H				Kida, Hiroshi			Unmasking of the Nature of Avian Influenza for the Successful Control	JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-NIPPON SHOKUHIN KAGAKU KOGAKU KAISHI												Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) causes lethal infection in gallinaceous poultry such as chickens. HPAIV is generated when a nonpathogenic virus brought in by migratory birds from nesting lakes in the north is transmitted to chickens via domestic ducks, geese, quails, etc. and acquires pathogenicity for chickens with repeated multiple infections in the chicken population. Now H5N1 HPAIV has spread to 62 countries in Eurasia and Africa H5N1 HPAIVs were isolated from dead water birds in Mongolia and Hokkaido, Japan on the way back to their nesting lakes in Siberia in April to May 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010. It is concerned that these HPAI viruses may perpetuate in the lakes where migratory water birds nest in summer. On 14th October in 2010,2 H5N1 HPAIVs were isolated from fecal samples of ducks who flew from Siberia to Ohnuma Lake in Wakkanai, Hokkaido, Japan. Since then, 24 outbreaks of avian influenza due to infection with the H5N1 viruses closely related to the viruses isolated from fecal samples of ducks in Hokkaido in October 2010 have occurred in 9 different prefectures in Japan until the end of March 2011. The other serious concern is that 620 people have been infected with the H5N1 virus, 60 % of whom died in 15 countries since 2004 (as of 15 February 2013). It is noted that most of the human cases (86%) are in China, Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Egypt where bird flu vaccines are used. It is strongly proposed to eradicate the H5N1 HPAIVs from Asia by stamping-out without misuse of vaccine through international collaboration under the umbrella of One World, One Health" concept.																			1341-027X						2013	60	7					371	374																WOS:000322429900009

Participants breathed through a face-mask with PEP = 0 cmH(2)O (PEP0, 0-45(th) min) and with PEP = 10 cmH(2)O (PEP10, 46-90(th) min). Arterial (SpO(2)), quadriceps and prefrontal (near infrared spectroscopy) oxygenation was measured continuously. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv, transcranial Doppler), cardiac function (2D-echocardiography), extravascular lung water accumulation (UsLC, thoracic ultrasound lung comets) and acute mountain sickness (Lake Louise score, LLS) were assessed during PEP0 and PEP10.Results: At 5,085 m with PEP0, SpO(2) was 78 +/- 4%, UsLC was 8 +/- 5 (a.u.) and the LLS was 2.3 +/- 1.7 (all P < 0.05 versus sea level). At 5,085 m, PEP10 increased significantly SpO(2) (+9 +/- 5%), quadriceps (+2 +/- 2%) and prefrontal cortex (+2 +/- 2%) oxygenation (P < 0.05), and decreased significantly MCAv (-16 +/- 14 cm.s(-1)) and cardiac output (-0.7 +/- 1.2 L.min(-1)) together with a reduced stroke volume (-9 +/- 15 mL, all P < 0.05) and no systemic hypotension. PEP10 decreased slightly the number of UsLC (-1.4 +/- 2.7, P = 0.04) while the incidence of acute mountain sickness (LLS >= 3) fell from 42% with PEP0 to 25% after PEP10 (P = 0.043).Conclusion: PEP10 breathing improved arterial and tissue oxygenation and symptoms of acute mountain sickness after trekking to very high altitude, despite reduced cerebral perfusion and cardiac output. Further studies are required to establish whether PEP-breathing prophylactic mechanisms also occur in participants with more severe acute mountain sickness.

Oxygen and sulfur isotope fractionation during sulfide oxidation by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Sulfide-mediated anoxygenic photosynthesis (SMAP) carried out by anaerobic phototrophic bacteria may have played an important role in sulfur cycling, formation of sulfate, and, perhaps, primary production in the Earth's early oceans. Determination of epsilon S-34(SO4-Sulfide-) and epsilon O-18(SO4-H2O) values for bacterial sulfide oxidation will permit more refined interpretation of the delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4) values measured in modern anoxic environments, such as meromictic lakes where sulfide commonly extends into the photic zone, and in the ancient rock record, particularly during periods of the Precambrian when anoxic and sulfidic (euxinic) conditions were believed to be more pervasive than today. Laboratory experiments with anaerobic purple and green sulfur phototrophs, Allochromatium vinosum and Chlorobaculum tepidum, respectively, were conducted to determine the sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation during the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate. Replicate experiments were conducted at 25 degrees C for A. vinosum and 45 degrees C for C. tepidum, and in duplicate at three different starting oxygen isotope values for water to determine sulfate-water oxygen isotope fractionations accurately (epsilon O-18(SO4-H2O)) center dot epsilon(18)(OSO4-H2O) values of 5.6 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and 5.4 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand were obtained for A. vinosum and C. tepidum, respectively. Temperature had no apparent effect on the epsilon O-18(SO4-H2O) values. By combining all data from both cultures, an average epsilon O-18(SO4-H2O) value of 5.6 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand was obtained for SMAP. This value falls between those previously reported for bacterial oxidation of sphalerite and elemental sulfur (7-9 parts per thousand) and abiotic and biotic oxidation of pyrite and chalcopyrite (2-4 parts per thousand). Sulfur isotope fractionation between sulfide and sulfate formed by A. vinosum was negligible (0.1 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) during all experiments. For C. tepidum an apparent fractionation of -2.3 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand was observed during the earlier stages of oxidation based on bulk delta S-34 measurements of sulfate and sulfide and became smaller (-0.7 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) when sulfate concentrations rose above 0.5 mM and sulfide concentrations had became negligible.

Here, in order to study the changes in Microcystis blooms under continuous aeration mixing, an experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with factors of varying biomass of Microcystis and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment in summer. There were three chlorophyll a (Chl-a) levels in six treatments: low Chl-a level of 68.4 mu g L-1 (treatments L, L-E), medium Chl-a level of 468.7 mu g L-1 (treatments M, M-E), and high Chl-a level of 924.1 mu g L-1 (treatments H, H-E). Treatments L-E, M-E and H-E were enriched with the same inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients. During the experiment of 30 days, the concentration of Microcystis and Chl-a decreased, and diatom Nitzschia palea cells appeared in all the treatments, which became dominant in treatments M, M-E, H and H-E, with the highest biomass of 9.41 +/- 1.96 mg L-1 Nitzschia in treatment H-E on day 30. The rank order of the biomass of Nitzschia from low to high was (L = L-E) < (M = M-E) < H < H-E (P < 0.05). In addition, Nitzschia cells were aggregates attached to Microcystis colonies in all the treatments. The results showed that the initial biomass of colonial Microcystis affected the algal shift from Microcystis dominance to Nitzschia dominance. However, the enriched inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus was beneficial for the Nitzschia increase in the high biomass treatment alone. The shift from Microcystis dominance to diatom dominance under continuous aeration mixing may be caused by low light conditions as well as the nutrients released from Microcystis decay. Moreover, the aerobic condition caused by aeration mixing maintained the colonial mucilaginous sheath to support the growth of Nitzschia cells in aggregation. This study found for the first time that Microcystis blooms could shift to diatom Nitzschia dominance in aggregates. It provided a method to control and manipulate Microcystis blooms to diatom dominance through continuous aeration mixing to proper biomass of Microcystis colonies. The shift to diatoms dominance would provide more high quality food organisms for aquaculture and be beneficial to the material cycling and energy flowing in food web dynamics.

Specific objectives are to (1) evaluate characteristics of spawning habitat in a number of different systems; (2) determine if spawning habitat can be predicted from data on land cover, geology, and physical characteristics in the lake or river; and (3) compare spawning habitat in inland lakes and some Great Lakes locations. In inland lakes, Muskellunge preferred to spawn over fine sediments near emergent and submersed vegetation in protected bays or shorelines, but bay and calm shoreline habitat is not always available and may be degraded, so they may end up spawning over open sand, gravel, or coarse particulate organic matter and spawning in areas without vegetation. For objective two, the best-performing MaxEnt model included shoreline development index, presence of nearby shallow areas, distance from out flowing streams, effective fetch, maximum depth, Carlson's trophic status index, and an indicator of east- or west-facing shoreline as significant factors predicting spawning locations in inland lakes. Overall, 64% of all observed spawning fell within locations predicted by a model, including the most suitable 40% of available habitat for all lakes. For objective 3, we compared habitat selection of Great Lakes-strain Muskellunge with the inland strain. MaxEnt models of habitat for Great Lakes Muskellunge included some similar factors like shallow depth and low slope, but also included river habitat factors like presence of moderate vegetative cover and woody debris. To conclude, we propose a conceptual model of Muskellunge spawning and nursery habitat where survival from egg to larva is limited by water quality, predation on eggs, and abundant food resources.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						183	201																WOS:000422891800022

The chemical and mineralogical characteristics of MSG (e.g., Halfmile Lake deposit) imply low pH (< 3) and relatively oxidizing conditions during gossan formation; oxidation of a volcanogenic massive sulfide body (comprising pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite) with a falling water table. The lack of light REE or heavy REE fractionation and preservation of positive Eu anomalies characteristic of the original (465 Ma) hydrothermal fluid is consistent with relatively large water-rock ratios during massive sulfide mineralization oxidation, and removal of the REE predominantly as sulfate complexes (LnSO(4+), Ln(SC4)(2)(-)). Low pH groundwaters recovered from past producing mines in the BMC display REE patterns reflecting those inferred to have occurred during gossan formation. Gossan at the Restigouche deposit, in contrast to the Halfmile Lake deposit, displays mineralogical and chemical evidence for having been chemically reworked since primary gossan formation. Evidence for chemical reworking includes loss of primary massive sulfide mineralization textures, replacement of plumbojarosite with anglesite, almost complete removal of jarosite minerals, loss of An, Sb, and As and apparent preferential removal of Eu, resulting in loss of positive Eu anomalies for most sampled; (average [Eu/Eu*](NASC) = 1.21 in the gossan, with many displaying strong negative anomalies; 3.65 in massive sulfide mineralization; 0.54 in host rocks). Based on geochemical modeling, conditions inferred for the chemical reworking of the Restigouche deposit include near neutral conditions and either relatively oxidizing conditions with Eu2+ hosted in a preferentially weathered mineral host (possibly through substitution for Pb in plumbojarosite and beudantite) or cycling between reduced and oxidized conditions during gossan reworking.

Changes in sediment accumulation rates were attributed to variability in the delivery of overbank sediment to each site as controlled by the frequency of Ohio River flooding. Sedi-mentation rates reached their lowest values in all three lakes between 400 and 1230 CE, indicating a regional reduction in flood frequencies on the lower Ohio River during a period that included the Me-dieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ca. 950-1250 CE). Sedimentation rates increased after ca. 1230 CE and remained moderately high through the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1350-1820 CE) until the onset of extensive land clearance during the early 1800s CE. After 1820 CE, sedimentation rates increased further and were higher than any other time during the late Holocene. A comparison of regional paleoclimatic proxies with the above floodplain sedimentation records shows that Ohio River flooding during the late Holocene was responsive to mean-state changes in atmospheric circulation. During the MCA, when clockwise mean -state atmospheric circulation advected southerly moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the Ohio River Valley primarily in the form of convective rainstorms, flooding on the Ohio River was least frequent. During the LIA, meridional mean-state atmospheric circulation increased the proportion of mid -continental moisture that was sourced from the northern Pacific and Arctic and delivered as snowfall, hence increasing flooding on the Ohio River. We attribute the increase in Ohio River flooding during the LIA to an increase in snowpack volume across the Ohio River Valley and the watershed-scale integration of runoff during spring snowmelt. Following Euro-American land clearance in the early 1800s, flood frequencies decoupled from this relationship and the lower Ohio River became susceptible to frequent flooding, despite a return to southerly and clockwise synoptic atmospheric conditions. These modern climate-flood dynamics are fundamentally different than those of the paleo-record and suggest that land-use changes -such as deforestation, tile draining, and landscape conversion to intensive row crop agriculture -have fundamentally altered the modern Midwestern hydrologic cycle.

The Chiweta Zone is in the northern part of the Malawi Rifted Zone, where an elevated heat flow anomaly and one of the hottest hot springs occur. Structurally controlled geothermal systems are poorly understood in Malawi and the entire Western Branch of the East African Rift System. The objectives of this study were to (1) construct a three-dimensional structural geometry of the faults identified with remote sensing and aeromagnetic data, (2) perform a slip-dilation tendency analysis to assess the fault reactivation potential under a stress state condition at depths between -700 and 1000 m.b.g.l. of the estimated reservoir, (3) identify, based on the results, which faults are critically stressed and serve as fluid conduits or barriers of the geothermal system, and (4) combine geological, geochemical, and geophysical data with our results to improve the conceptual model of the Chiweta Geothermal System (CGS). Our findings indicate that - NW- and -NNE-striking faults southwest- and northwest dipping, respectively, show segments with the highest dilation values of Td -0.6 to Td -0.8 and probably behave as active fluid pathways. This is supported by the Chiweta Fault, a NW-striking and southwest-dipping fault that controls the only thermal manifestations in the Chiweta Zone. NW- and NE-striking faults dipping to the northeast and southeast, respectively, show lower dilation values of Td -0.1 to Td -0.5 and probably act as fluid barriers. These results allowed us to define, for the first time, possible structural boundaries of the Chiweta geothermal reservoir and to improve its geothermal conceptual model. The results of this study may help identify favorable areas to target the first exploratory wells and where further subsurface studies (e.g., MT surveys and seismic reflection) should be conducted in the Chiweta Zone. Finally, our methodology is expected to be applied to other geothermal prospects in the Western Branch of the East African Rift System and help advance geothermal energy production in this region.

J	Kemp, SJ; Merriman, RJ				Kemp, S. J.; Merriman, R. J.			Polyphase low-grade metamorphism of the Ingleton Group, northern England, UK: a case study of metamorphic inversion in a mudrock succession	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												A series of boreholes in Horton Quarry, northwest Yorkshire (Horton-in-Ribblesdale Inlier) penetrated mudstones and slates belonging to the Austwick Formation (Windermere Supergroup) overlying laminated mudstones of the Ingleton Group. Illite (IC) and chlorite (ChC) crystallinity measurements indicate a metamorphic inversion between the two groups of mudrocks. The Windermere Supergroup mudrocks are mostly in the high anchizone or epizone, whereas the Ingletonian samples are lower grade in terms of W, and are mostly deep diagenetic zone or low anchizone. Hence younger strata at higher grades rest on older strata at lower grades, creating a metamorphic inversion. Ingletonian slates exposed at Pecca Falls on the River Twiss show epizonal and anchizonal IC values, and greywacke samples from Ingleton Quarry contain pumpellyite. This suggests that grade in the Ingletonian may increase to the NW from the Horton to Ingleton inliers. K-white mica b cell dimensions show further differences between the Ingleton Group and the Windermere Supergroup. The Ingletonian samples are characterized by low b cell values (8.999 9.035, mean 9.007 angstrom), whereas the Windermere Supergroup has higher values in the range 9.022 9.034, mean 9.027 angstrom. The Windermere Supergroup values are similar to those recorded from the Windermere Supergroup of the southern Lake District, and Lower Palaeozoic rocks from the Scottish Southern Uplands, and are consistent with metamorphism in a low heat flow, convergent geotectonic setting. The Ingletonian b cell values suggest metamorphism in a higher heat flow setting, most likely an extensional basin. The metamorphic inversion at Horton and differences in K-white mica b cell dimensions suggest that the Ingleton Group and Windermere Supergroup strata evolved in different geotectonic settings and record two separate metamorphic events.

While the impact of external nutrient loads on lake eutrophication has been extensively studied, the role of internal nutrient cycling in lake ecosystems remains underexplored. In this study, the hierarchical bootstrap generalized linear model (HBGLM) to long-term summer water quality data (1999-2020) from Lake Dianchi, China, to explore the relative importance of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), as well as the limitations of N and P on the growth of phytoplankton. The results revealed that from 1999 to 2020, the Chla and TP concentrations decreased by 49% and 78%, respectively, and that internal nutrient cycling significantly influenced changes in nutrient concentrations, reflecting the relationships among N, P, and chlorophyll a (Chla). Particularly in 2007, 2013, and 2017, the long-term trends of the TN:TP ratio, an indicator of potential nutrient limitation in the lake, were consistent with changes in the distributions of the average slopes of TN and TP across different periods, indicating that these years primarily exhibited patterns of colimitation by N and P or P limitation, indirectly confirming that Lake Dianchi will transition from N and P colimitation to being limited primarily by P. This study reveals that N is typically the primary limiting element, while P is a key element promoting water eutrophication. To further validate improvements to existing eutrophication mitigation models, conducting carefully de-signed experiments at different scales is recommended.																				2073-4441				SEP 3	2025	17	17							2604	10.3390/w17172604	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17172604													WOS:001569538400001
J	Dondajewska-Pielka, R				Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata			Spatial and Temporal Variability in the Bottom Sediment Characteristics of a Shallow Lake under Backwater Separation and Application of Effective Microorganisms	SUSTAINABILITY												Lake Konin is a small and shallow lake under the influence of highly eutrophic riverine waters. Feeding the lake as a backwater during high water level periods, the River Obra had exerted a decisive impact on lake water quality, and thus a new dike with a closing device was created. Protective measures were followed by the application of Effective Microorganisms (EM), aiming at a reduction in nutrient concentrations and CyanoHABs. Positive changes in the ecosystem were initiated (increased phytoplankton diversity), but cyanobacteria blooms were still present due to high nutrient content. Some changes were observed in the lake sediments (phosphorus (P) and its fractions, P in pore waters, organic matter and experimental assessment of internal P loading) studied before and during treatment. A slight increase in P content in sediments was noted, as a result of an increase in the Res-P fraction. Simultaneously, a decrease in the most mobile fractions was observed. Summer internal P load was reduced from 5.4 kgP d-1 before the treatment to less than 1 kgP d-1 in the first year, but increased again in the second year to 4.5 kgP d-1. Similarly to lake water quality, positive changes were induced in the lake sediments; nevertheless, they still acted as an important source of nutrients for primary producers. Additional restoration methods shall be considered, as combined treatments used simultaneously are reported to be the most effective for water quality improvement.																				2071-1050				OCT	2024	16	19							8650	10.3390/su16198650	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16198650													WOS:001332985700001

Stormwater may modify water conductivity, increase pollutant and sediment input and promote flushing effects, turbulence and mixing of the water column due to water inflow, air temperature decrease and strong winds. In turn, changes on physicochemical conditions have an effect on the dynamics of primary producers and higher trophic levels. In the urban context, catchment response to rain takes place in a few tens of minutes and the monitoring of urban runoff impacts on lakes should take advantage of high frequency monitoring technologies, which provide appropriate time resolution for analysing these phenomena. Improving our understanding of stormwater runoff impacts on lake ecosystems is critical to define strategies for water resources and catchment management and to cope with land use changes due to population growth and increasing urbanization as well as climate change impacts on hydrological processes. Lake Pampulha in Brazil (mean depth: 5.0 m, 197 ha) is an urban water body that has been monthly monitored since September 2011. Water temperature, conductivity and pH were measured every 0.5 m in a middle site in the lake. Flow of Lake Pampulha main tributaries are monitored every 10 minutes since October 2011 using automatic sensors. The General Lake Model (GLM) was used to model water temperature and mixing in the lake. Simulated water temperature showed good agreement with observed water temperature (rmse = 0.70 degrees C). Model results and moni toring data showed that stormwater runoff are responsible for mixing the water column and disrupting algal growth during wet summer.

Its water contains about 340 g/l total dissolved salts. Divalent cations dominate in the brine, which presently contains about 1.89 M magnesium and 0.44 M calcium, in addition to about 1.6 M sodium and 0.2 M potassium. The main anions are chloride and bromide (99% and 1% of the anion sum, respectively). The pH of the brine is about 6.0, and its water activity was estimated at about 0.66. The lake is saturated with respect to sodium chloride. The negative water balance in recent years caused a mass precipitation of halite, with a concomitant increase in the relative concentrations of divalent cations. In spite of the fact that molar concentrations of divalent cations are strongly inhibitory to most halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms, the Dead Sea is inhabited by a variety of microorganisms. These include halophilic Archaea (Halorubrum sodomense, Nalobaculum gomorrense, Haloferax volcanii, and others), well adapted to growth at high magnesium concentrations, unicellular green algae (Dunaliella parva), and a few species of halophilic Bacteria. Dunaliella, being the sole primary producer in the lake, does not grow in undiluted Dead Sea water. However, when the upper water layers become diluted by more than 10% as a result of winter rain floods, mass blooms may develop, followed by mass development of red halophilic Archaea, which thrive on the organic material produced by the algae. During the often prolonged periods between the bloom events, during which the salinity of the brines is high and halite precipitates, a small community of Archaea remained present in a state of little activity, but ready to resume growth as soon as a suitable source of organic material becomes available.					ören, aziz/A-4233-2019														0277-786X		0-8194-2896-5				1998	3441						44	54		10.1117/12.319856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.319856													WOS:000078010100005

A large part of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) is currently served by groundwater pumped up from an aquifer deep below the city. The city draws water from the aquifers more rapidly than they can recharge themselves. The adjacent town of Salt Lake City covering an area of 12.35 km(2) was a conglomerate of several salt lakes 50 years back. Though planned as a satellite town, the water level is also decreasing fast due to overuse of groundwater at the rate of 20 cm/year. Therefore the objectives of this study are to find the reason for depletion of the water level, depict the present piezometric level in both Kolkata and Salt Lake City, identify the threat of land subsidence and arsenic contamination already begun in the area and classify the areawise subsidence rate to assume the future threat. The methodology followed in this chapter is mainly the analysis of the secondary data related to the temporal change of groundwater level, counting the land subsidence rate, and so on. The result shows that the city's water level has receded by 7-11 m between 1958 and 2003, especially in some areas of both north and south Kolkata. In around 30 % of the city area the level comes close to or falls below the clay layer which is ideal for subsidence and in some areas subsidence ranges from 10 to 14 mm a year creating high-risk zones. The remedial measures are given in the form of groundwater recharge by rainwater harvesting and mandatory installation of rooftop harvesting in Kolkata and Salt Lake along with improvement of the chemical quality of the water.																			2194-315X		978-3-319-26443-1; 978-3-319-26442-4				2016							153	173		10.1007/978-3-319-26443-1_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-26443-1_11	10.1007/978-3-319-26443-1												WOS:000370531900013

Spatio-temporal evolution of Yellowstone deformation between 1992 and 2009 from InSAR and GPS observations	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of Yellowstone deformation between 1992 and 2009 is monitored using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired by the European Remote-Sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) and the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT). These data are combined with continuous global positioning system (GPS) measurements to identify four discrete episodes of caldera subsidence and uplift, these episodes are: 1992-1995 (subsidence of 2.7 cm/year), 1996-2000 (subsidence of 0.5 cm/year, with local uplift of 1.7 cm/year at Norris), 2000-2004 (subsidence of 0.7 cm/year, with local uplift of 0.6 cm/year at Norris), and 2004-2009 (uplift of 3-8 cm/year, with local subsidence of 1-4 cm/year at Norris). We construct the full three-dimensional velocity field of Yellowstone deformation for 2005-2006 from ascending and descending ENVISAT orbits. The InSAR three-dimensional velocity field and three-component GPS measurements indicate that the majority of the observed deformation (3-8 cm/year) across the Yellowstone caldera and near Norris Geyser Basin (NGB) occurred in the vertical direction between the summers of 2005 and 2006. During this time, significant lateral displacements of 3-7 cm/year also occurred in the east-west direction at the southeastern and western rims of the Yellowstone caldera and in the area between Hebgen Lake and NGB. Minor north-south displacements of about 0.2 cm/year also occurred, however, in the southwestern section of the caldera and near Yellowstone Lake during the same period. The calculated three-dimensional velocity field for 2005-2006 implies the existence of two pressure-point sources, beneath the two structural resurgent domes in the Yellowstone caldera, connected by a planar conduit, rather than a single, large sill as proposed in previous studies. Furthermore, no measurable displacements occurred along any fault zone across the caldera during the entire period of observation (1992-2009). Therefore, we infer that magmatic and hydrothermal processes beneath the Yellowstone caldera and NGB were the main sources of deformation.

In order to prolong navigation, it becomes necessary to destroy the ice cover. Hovercraft are used for this purpose. The ice cover is also used as ice crossings and the delivery of various cargoes along them. Therefore, it is important to know the modes of motion of the source of disturbances, at which the destruction of the ice cover occurs. In the linear formulation, a theoretical analysis of the effect of ice compression and the speed of load displacement on three-dimensional bending-gravity waves, which are formed in this case, is carried out. The ice cover is modeled by a thin elastic isotropic plate floating on the surface of a liquid of finite depth. The oscillation equation of the plate is taken as a boundary condition on the surface of the liquid. On the basis of analytical expressions obtained by the method of integral transformations, the structure of the emerging wave motion is studied. For the velocity of the load movement greater than the minimum value of the phase velocity of the bending-gravitational wave, one, three or two wave systems are formed. At large values of the compressive force, the nature of the wave disturbance in the wave wake behind the source changes significantly, waves overlap. In this case, depending on the speed of movement of the source, from two to three wave systems are formed. Analytical expressions are obtained for the critical velocities at which the structure of the wave disturbance changes. The dependence of critical velocities on the forces of compression, stretching and thickness of the ice sheet is investigated. The angular zones in which waves are formed are determined. The influence of compressive forces and the velocity of displacement of disturbances on the sizes of angular zones covered by waves is investigated.																			2073-7173						2022		4	1				251	257		10.37220/MIT.2022.58.4.050	http://dx.doi.org/10.37220/MIT.2022.58.4.050													WOS:000895952600034

Paleoclimate change and heat flow density inferred from temperature data in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Four boreholes, located near Cochrane, Hearst, Minchin Lake, and Otoskwin River in the Superior Province of the Canadian Shield, were logged in 1969/1970, and again in the summer of 1985. We have used the obtained temperature-depth (T-z) data and the thermal property measurements to estimate the ground surface temperature (GST) histories and the heat flow densities at these sites, using a least squares inverse method. The method employs the theory of heat conduction in a laterally homogeneous Earth and the concept of incorporating a priori information to stabilize and uniquely determine the solution. We formulate the least squares optimization problem in the functional spaces and solve it with a quasi-Newton iterative gradient method. The functional space formulation allows the gradient operator to be obtained by solving only forward problems and the quasi-Newton method, which has a second order convergence, allows the a posteriori covariance operator to be readily computed. Except for the Cochrane hole, where systematic errors appear to exist in the temperature measurements, the two T-z logs for each hole, whether inverted individually or simultaneously, yield highly consistent, though not identical, results. All of the estimated GST histories, except that for Otoskwin River, exhibit a broad low centered around 1800 A. D. (the Little Ice Age), preceeded by a warm period in the Mid-Holocene (the Little Climatic Optimum) and followed by a warming trend in the last 100 years. However, the GST histories differ significantly from hole to hole in terms of the amplitude and the timing of their temporal variations. This suggests that the T-z data may have been significantly perturbed by local topography, lateral heterogeneities in the subsurface thermal properties, groundwater circulation, etc., which are not taken into account in the theory of one-dimensional heat conduction.																			0031-0182					DEC	1992	98	2-4					143	165		10.1016/0031-0182(92)90194-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(92)90194-A													WOS:000202963800008

Johannes			The Importance of Inland Water CO2, CH4, and N2O for Summertime Greenhouse Gas Exchange With the Atmosphere in Arctic Tundra Lowlands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland waters in Arctic landscapes act as conduits of terrestrial organic material, transporting and processing organic material into the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and subsequently exchanging these gases with the atmosphere. To assess the role of inland water emissions in the Arctic GHG budget, it is necessary to quantify their emissions in relation to the terrestrial sink capacity. We present measurements of dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O from lake, pond, and low-order fluvial systems across two summers (2016-2017) in the Arctic Siberian Indigirka River tundra lowlands. During May-July 2017, the region experienced large-scale flooding, of which we captured the tail end. Using remote sensing images to upscale inland water emissions to an area of approximately 18 km2, we calculated combined carbon (C) emissions, CO2-C, and diffusive CH4-C under nonflood and flooded scenarios. These ranged from 7.03 +/- 1.30 Mg C d-1 (nonflood; mean +/- SD) to 9.63 +/- 1.24 Mg C d-1 (flooded). Integrating these values into the total C landscape exchange offset the terrestrial C sink by similar to 9-similar to 13%. When N2O emissions were calculated as CO2 equivalents, these emissions were negligible relative to CO2 and CH4. Our study shows that in the northeast Siberian Arctic tundra, summertime CO2 and CH4 emissions from inland waters are a potentially important component of landscape C exchange with the atmosphere, offsetting the terrestrial sink capacity, and this may be an important consideration for constraining future Arctic responses to climate warming.

Regional and Longitudinal Dynamics of Cyanobacterial Blooms/Cyanobiome and Cyanotoxin Production in the Great Lakes Area	TOXINS												Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a diverse group of prokaryotic microorganisms that impact global biogeochemical cycles. Under eutrophic conditions, cyanobacterial species can produce cyanotoxins, resulting in harmful algal blooms (cHABs) that degrade water quality and result in economic and recreational losses. The Laurentian Great Lakes, a key global freshwater source, are increasingly affected by these blooms. To understand the underlying mechanisms in cHAB formation, we investigated microcystin levels, cyanotoxin genes/transcripts, and taxonomic/microcystin metabarcoding across three sampling locations in the Canadian Great Lakes region, including Hamilton Harbour, Bay of Quinte, and Three Mile Lake (Muskoka), to observe the regional and longitudinal cyanobacterial dynamics. The results revealed a positive correlation between microcystin levels, the occurrence of cyanobacterial taxonomic/cyanotoxin molecular markers, and the relative widespread abundance of specific dominant cyanobacterial taxa, including Planktothrix, Microcystis, and Dolichospermum. The Cyanobium genus was not observed in Hamilton Harbor samples during late summer (August to September), while it was consistently observed in the Three Mile Lake and Bay of Quinte samples. Notably, Dolichospermum and saxitoxin genes were predominantly higher in Three Mile Lake (an inland lake), suggesting site-specific characteristics influencing saxitoxin production. Additionally, among the potential microcystin producers, in addition to Microcystis, Hamilton Harbour and Bay of Quinte samples showed consistent presence of less dominant microcystin-producing taxa, including Phormidium and Dolichospermum. This study highlights the complexity of cHAB formation and the variability in cyanotoxin production in specific environments. The findings highlight regional and site-specific factors that can influence cyanobacterial taxonomic and molecular profiles, necessitating the integration of advanced molecular technologies for effective monitoring and targeted management strategies.					; Rahman, Mahbuba/AAR-2085-2020; , Mahbuba/AAR-2085-2020; Saleem, Faizan/LYO-5122-2024; li, enze/AAT-5121-2021; Schellhorn, Herb/C-2699-2012	Zastepa, Arthur/0000-0003-1292-932X; LI, ENZE/0000-0002-1964-5998; , Mahbuba/0000-0003-4586-4067; Schellhorn, Herb/0000-0003-3564-1695														2072-6651				NOV	2024	16	11							471	10.3390/toxins16110471	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins16110471								39591226					WOS:001366462800001
J	Jordan, MJ; Nadelhoffer, KJ; Fry, B				Jordan, MJ; Nadelhoffer, KJ; Fry, B			Nitrogen cycling in forest and grass ecosystems irrigated with N-15-enriched wastewater	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Nitrogen cycling was studied during the first 2 yr of spray irrigation of vegetation by treated wastewater in Falmouth (Cape God), Massachusetts. We attempted to lake advantage of an unexpected natural N-15 enrichment during wastewater treatment to trace the fate of wastewater N following irrigation. Wastewater N was enriched by 6-20 parts per thousand relative to soil and by 13-25 parts per thousand relative to vegetation. We were able to estimate retention of wastewater N by soil using a mass balance of N-15. However, under conditions of N saturation delta(15)N values for plants were lower than expected, possibly due to discrimination against N-15 during uptake of NH4+ and NO3- by plant roots. This is a potential weakness of trying to use low-level natural N-15 enrichment in a tracer study. This problem is not likely to occur in N-limited ecosystems, or at high levels of isotopic enrichment. Three different ecosystem types were irrigated: a successional pitch pine woodland 26 yr in age; a mixed oak-pitch pine forest >70 yr in age; and cleared areas revegetated with grasses and old-field weeds. Areas near the spray heads were overloaded with N at deposition rates of 370-480 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1). Pine woods and grass areas rapidly became N saturated; soil pore water NO3- levels reached 800 mu mol/L in irrigation in year 1 and 1400 mu mol/L in year 2. In contrast, soil pore water NO3- levels in the oak forest did not consistently exceed 100 mu mol/L until late in year 2. Soil was a major sink for wastewater N in year 1, but in year 2 soil N retention fell to near zero, and N leaching losses greatly increased. At the onset of N saturation, irrigated forests were invaded by weedy species including Phytolacca americana, Polygonum convolvulus, and Solanum dulcamera, later followed by Celastrus orbiculatus and Lonicera tartarica.

Here we report on a sequence of Middle Miocene volcaniclastic deposits intercalated with lacustrine strata from the Livno-Tomislavgrad Basin, part of the Dinaride Lake System. We applied a multi-proxy approach to elucidate their source, decipher their emplacement mechanism, and evaluate their basin-scale and regional correlativity. New high-precision zircon geochronology (similar to 14.32 Ma) reveals their simultaneity with numerous volcaniclastic deposits (and their alteration products) widely spread across the Alpine-Mediterranean region. Additionally, their correlativity is confirmed at the scale of the Livno-Tomislavgrad Basin, based on similar lithostratigraphy, mineralogy and volcanic glass geochemistry. Newly obtained zircon Hf isotope data imply that Livno-Tomislavgrad Basin distal volcaniclastic deposits and similar to 14.36 Ma Harsany ignimbrite of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region had shared a parental eruptive center. However, different volcanic glass geochemistry, bolstered by the high-precision geochronology, suggests distinct eruption events, implying more frequent explosive volcanism of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region during Middle Miocene than previously recognized. We suggest that the similar to 14.32 Ma fine fallout tephra, deposited in the distal basin in the Dinarides (> 400 km from the source), was likely re-mobilized by water-driven hillside erosion from the extensive paleo-relief, and further transported via land-derived gravity flows. Upon entering the lake, the gravity flows likely transformed into subaqueous sediment density flows. These deposited similar to 1 to 7-m-thick overall graded volcaniclastic turbidites, thinning away from the presumed source of tephra re-mobilization. Although over-thickened, the similar to 14.32 Ma Livno-Tomislavgrad Basin volcaniclastic deposits can still serve as a reliable tephro- and tectono-stratigraphic markers due to their rapid mode of accumulation.

Microbial communities of the stratified soda Lake Doroninskoe (Transbaikal region)	MICROBIOLOGY												The physicochemical properties, species composition, and vertical distribution of microorganisms in the water column, shoreline microbial mat, and small shoreline mud volcanoes of the stratified soda Lake Doroninskoe were investigated in September 2007. The lake is located in the Transbaikal region, in the permafrost zone (51A degrees 25'N; 112A degrees 28'E). The maximal depth of the contemporary lake is about 6 m, the pH value of the water is 9.72, and the water mineralization in the near-bottom horizon is 32.3 g l(-1). In summer, the surface oxygen-containing horizon of the water column becomes demineralized to 26.5 g l(-1); at a depth of 3.5-4.0 m, an abrupt transition occurs to the aerobic zone containing hydrosulfide (up to 12.56 g l(-1)). Hydrosulfide was also detected in trace quantities in the upper water horizons. The density stratification of the water column usually ensures stable anaerobic conditions until the freezing period (November and December). The primary production of oxygenic phototrophs reached 176-230 mu g l(-1). High rates of dark CO2 assimilation (61-240 mu g l(-1)) were detected in the chemocline. Within this zone, an alkaliphilic species of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of the genus Thioalkalivibrio was detected (10(4) cells ml(-1)). Lithoheterotrophic bacteria Halomonas spp., as well as bacteriochlorophyll a-containing aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAP) Roseinatronobacter sp. capable of thiosulfate oxidation, were isolated from samples collected from the aerobic zone (0-3 m). The water transparency in September was extremely low; therefore, no visible clusters of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APBs) were detected at the boundary of the hydrosulfide layer. However, purple sulfur bacteria which, according to the results of the 16S rRNA gene analysis, belong to the species Thioalkalicoccus limnaeus, Ectothiorhodospira variabilis, "Ect. magna," and Ect. shaposhnikovii, were isolated from samples of deep silt sediments. Ect. variabilis and Ect. shaposhnikovii were the major APB species in the shoreline algo-bacterial mat. The halotolerant bacterium Ect. shaposhnikovii, purple nonsulfur bacteria of the genus Rhodobacter, and AAP of Roseococcus sp. were isolated from the samples collected from mud volcanoes. All these species are alkaliphiles, moderate halophiles, or halotolerant microorganisms.

J	DAVEY, MC				DAVEY, MC			CARBON AND NITROGEN DYNAMICS IN A MARITIME ANTARCTIC STREAM	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The carbon and nitrogen dynamics in a maritime Antarctic lake outflow stream were investigated. The stream and the algal communities could be split into two zones: a semi-aquatic margin consisting of a perennial cyanobacteria/diatom mat and a flowing channel with a similar perennial mat that was overgrown by annual filamentous chlorophytes during the course of the summer. 2. Neither algal community was limited by nutrient availability. Major nutrients were always available in the stream water. There were slight differences in the atomic ratios of the mats, the N:P ratios in the channel mat being lower than those in the marginal mat. However, both these and the total dissolved N:P ratio in the stream water were all close to those that indicate a balanced supply. 3. There was no net carbon or nitrogen accumulation by the marginal mat suggesting that uptake processes were balanced by loss processes. 4. Maximum rates of carbon fixation (0.1-0.5 mg C g-1 dry weight h-1) were similar to those of other perennial Antarctic algal mats. Productivity appeared to be limited by physical factors, but the effects of irradiance and temperature could not be separated. 5. There were no heterocystous cyanobacteria in the mat communities and rates of atmospheric nitrogen fixation were very low (0-10 ng N mg-1 mat N h-1). Fixation accounted for only 0.3% of the nitrogen accumulation of the channel mats, but was higher in the marginal mat where uptake of other sources of nitrogen was also low. 6. Nitrogen accumulation by the channel mat averaged 0.34 g N m-2 day-1. Only 0.05 g N m-2 day-1 was accounted for by the uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (nitrate plus ammonium). The major (80%) source of nitrogen appeared to be dissolved organic nitrogen. Recycling of nitrogen within the stream ecosystem may also be important.																			0046-5070					OCT	1993	30	2					319	330		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00812.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00812.x													WOS:A1993MF40100012

Therefore, it is vital to develop effective methods to control blooms. Phalaris arundinacea, a dominant hygrophyte in the Lake Poyang wetland, decomposes when submerged during high-water-level periods. Through indoor cultivation experiments, we examined the effects of crude aqueous, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and petroleum ether extracts of P. arundinacea on the growth of typical harmful bloom-forming cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa and Dolichospermum flos-aquae). The results revealed that the crude aqueous extract of P. arundinacea significantly inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa and D. flos-aquae, with average inhibition rates of 86.77 per cent and 80.08 per cent, respectively. The inhibitory effect generally increased with time and dose, with maximum inhibition rates of 99.15 per cent for M. aeruginosa and 97.27 per cent for D. flos-aquae. P. arundinacea crude extracts obtained with ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and petroleum ether reduced the cell density and chlorophyll a concentration of M. aeruginosa. Among the extracts, the petroleum ether extract had the strongest inhibitory effect. Generally, the inhibition rates of these three crude organic solvent extracts peaked on Day 8 or Day 12 of the experiment. The results confirmed that P. arundinacea, a dominant hygrophyte in Lake Poyang, has significant potential for controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms through the release of allelochemicals and likely plays an important role in this process in summer. Therefore, this study offers novel insights and materials for the prevention and management of cyanobacterial blooms in the future.

J	Riedel, JL				Riedel, J. L.			DEGLACIATION OF THE NORTH CASCADE RANGE, WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA, FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM TO THE HOLOCENE	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												Glacial retreat from the North Cascade Range after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at approximately 21 ka until the end of the Pleistocene at 11.6 ka was complex and included both continental and alpine glaciers. Alpine valley glaciers reached their maximum extent before 21.4 ka, then underwent a punctuated retreat to valley heads. In the south, beyond the reach of ice sheet glaciation, several end moraines were deposited after the LGM. Moraines marking a re-advance of alpine glaciers to <5 km below modern glaciers were deposited from 13.7 to 11.6 ka. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet flowed south from near 52 degrees north latitude in British Columbia into the North Cascades. At its maximum size the ice sheet covered more than 500 km(2) and had a surface elevation of 2200 m in upper Skagit valley. Deglaciation commenced about 16 ka by frontal retreat of ice flanking the mountains. Surface lowering eventually exposed regional hydrologic divides and stranded ice masses more than 1000 m thick in valleys. Isolated fragments of the ice sheet disintegrated rapidly from 14.5 to 13.5 ka, with the pattern of deglaciation in each valley controlled by valley orientation, topography, and climate. Like alpine glaciers to the south, retreat of the ice sheet remnants was slowed by millennial scale climate fluctuations that produced at least one large recessional moraine, and multiple lateral moraines and kame terraces from elevations of 200-1400 m in most valleys. Large volumes of glacial meltwater flowed through the North Cascades and was concentrated in the Skagit and Methow rivers. Outburst floods from deep proglacial lakes spilled across divides and down steep canyons, depositing coarse gravel terraces and alluvial fans at valley junctions. Climate at the LGM was characterized by a mean summer temperature 6 to 7 degrees C cooler than today, and 40% lower mean annual precipitation. Persistence of this climate for thousands of years before the LGM caused a 750-1000 m decrease in alpine glacier equilibrium line altitudes (ELA). In the southern North Cascades at 16 ka, glacial ELAs were 500-700 m lower than today, and during advances from 13.7 to 11.6 ka alpine glacier ELAs were 200-400 m lower.																			0211-6820	1697-9540					2017	43	2					467	496		10.18172/cig.3236	http://dx.doi.org/10.18172/cig.3236													WOS:000418809200006

Fish assemblages and biotic integrity of a highly modified floodplain river, the Upper Mississippi, and a large, relatively unimpacted tributary, the Lower Wisconsin	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The Upper Mississippi River is a dynamic floodplain river that has been largely transformed by navigational levees and dams since the 1930s. The pools upstream of each dam are lake-like and only about the upper third of each reach retains a riverine character. In contrast, the Wisconsin River is not managed for commercial navigation and today its lower 149 km represent one of the least-degraded large river reaches in central North America. Riverine reaches in both the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers have similar macro-habitats including numerous islands, large side channels, and connected backwaters and floodplain lakes. In this study, shoreline electrofishing samples were collected during summer 2002 and 2003 to characterize resident fish assemblages. We compared fish species abundance, biomass, and biotic integrity along main and side channel borders between the Upper Mississippi River and the Lower Wisconsin River. We expected that, in the absence of environmental degradation, fish composition and structure would be similar between the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers, and between channel types within each river. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and redundancy analysis revealed that fish species in the Mississippi River, unlike in the Wisconsin River, were characteristic of non-riverine habitats. We consider non-riverine fish assemblages indicative of environmental impairment. The main and side channel sites in the Mississippi River had more variable fish assemblages than the Wisconsin River. Analyses of fish index of biotic integrity scores showed that environmental condition was excellent for both channel types in the Wisconsin River, whereas in the Mississippi River the side channel was rated good and the main channel only fair. We conclude that differences between the two rivers and between channel types of the Mississippi River are consistent with direct and indirect effects of navigation. This study demonstrates the utility of a fish index of biotic integrity, an inexpensive and rapid bioassessment tool, for detecting change in ecological health on one of the world's largest rivers.

Low-temperature serpentinization processes and kimberlite groundwater signatures in the Kirkland Lake and Lake Timiskiming kimberlite fields, Ontario, Canada: implications for diamond exploration	GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS												Groundwaters from diamondiferous kimberlite pipes in the Kirkland Lake and Lake Timiskaming regions display unusual geochemical characteristics and signatures compared with groundwaters from the surrounding host rock. Reaction modelling was used to better constrain water/rock ratios, alteration mineralogy and groundwater geochemistry. A soil-zone Ca-HCO3- water from glacial till was reacted, using a reaction-modelling program, with three different suites of minerals: a kimberlite suite, a felsic intrusive suite and a mafic intrusive suite. Decreasing pH and alkalinity with increasing water/rock ratios in model reactions with the kimberlite suite suggest that,sampled groundwaters are from both the hypabyssal facies (high pH and alkalinity; low water/rock ratios) and the diatreme facies (low pH and alkalinity; high water/rock ratios). Geochemical concentrations of sampled groundwaters from kimberlites were compared to modelled waters; results indicate that these waters are different from those flowing through local felsic or mafic intrusive rocks. The kimberlitic groundwaters, and modelled waters, contain low concentrations of Mg and Fe, high concentrations of K and Ca, have elevated pH (up to 12.45), and are defined as a Ca-OH- water for the A4 and B30 kimberlites. In contrast, the C14, Diamond Lake and 95-2 kimberlites contain groundwaters that have higher Mg and Fe, lower Ca and K concentrations, and relatively low pH (8.5-10). The reaction model suggests that different minerals precipitate where the water interacts with different kimberlite facies and/or where a different water/rock ratio exists. More hydroxide phases form where pH and hydroxide alkalinity are high. Where kimberlite waters interact with host-rock waters, minerals not likely to be found otherwise, such as magnesite, brucite and magnetite, may be detected along fractures, or near seeps or springs where groundwater comes to surface. Exploration for kimberlites can benefit from the use of groundwater. Groundwater interaction with kimberlitic rocks produces characteristic aqueous geochemical anomalies due to low-temperature serpentinization reactions. The identification of geochemical anomalies in the groundwaters down-flow of a kimberlite and the unusual mineral assemblages that may precipitate from these groundwaters may aid in the location of undiscovered kimberlites.					; Leybourne, Matthew/AAA-9340-2019	Leybourne, Matthew/0000-0002-2361-6014; 													1467-7873					FEB	2007	7		1				3	21		10.1144/1467-7873/06-900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/1467-7873/06-900													WOS:000243752600002
J	Hudson, AG; Vonlanthen, P; Bezault, E; Seehausen, O				Hudson, Alan G.; Vonlanthen, Pascal; Bezault, Etienne; Seehausen, Ole			Genomic signatures of relaxed disruptive selection associated with speciation reversal in whitefish	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Background: Speciation reversal: the erosion of species differentiation via an increase in introgressive hybridization due to the weakening of previously divergent selection regimes, is thought to be an important, yet poorly understood, driver of biodiversity loss. Our study system, the Alpine whitefish (Coregonus spp.) species complex is a classic example of a recent postglacial adaptive radiation: forming an array of endemic lake flocks, with the independent origination of similar ecotypes among flocks. However, many of the lakes of the Alpine radiation have been seriously impacted by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, resulting in a collapse in neutral genetic and phenotypic differentiation within the most polluted lakes. Here we investigate the effects of eutrophication on the selective forces that have shaped this radiation, using population genomics. We studied eight sympatric species assemblages belonging to five independent parallel adaptive radiations, and one species pair in secondary contact. We used AFLP markers, and applied F-ST outlier (BAYESCAN, DFDIST) and logistic regression analyses (MATSAM), to identify candidate regions for disruptive selection in the genome and their associations with adaptive traits within each lake flock. The number of outlier and adaptive trait associated loci identified per lake were then regressed against two variables (historical phosphorus concentration and contemporary oxygen concentration) representing the strength of eutrophication. Results: Whilst we identify disruptive selection candidate regions in all lake flocks, we find similar trends, across analysis methods, towards fewer disruptive selection candidate regions and fewer adaptive trait/candidate loci associations in the more polluted lakes. Conclusions: Weakened disruptive selection and a concomitant breakdown in reproductive isolating mechanisms in more polluted lakes has lead to increased gene flow between coexisting Alpine whitefish species. We hypothesize that the resulting higher rates of interspecific recombination reduce either the number or extent of genomic islands of divergence surrounding loci evolving under disruptive natural selection. This produces the negative trend seen in the number of selection candidate loci recovered during genome scans of whitefish species flocks, with increasing levels of anthropogenic eutrophication: as the likelihood decreases that AFLP restriction sites will fall within regions of heightened genomic divergence and therefore be classified as F-ST outlier loci. This study explores for the first time the potential effects of human-mediated relaxation of disruptive selection on heterogeneous genomic divergence between coexisting species.

J	Pejler, B				Pejler, B			Relation to habitat in rotifers	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 06-11, 1994	POLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL, MIKOLAJKI, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci, Inst Ecol, Polish Hydrobiol Soc, Rotifer Sect	POLISH ACAD SCI, INST ECOL			Rotifera should be especially suited for an analysis of habitat relations because this group contains such a high number of species, inhabiting diverse environments. Furthermore, rotifers are to a large extent cosmopolitan, implying that ecological barriers, rather than geographical, are decisive of their distribution. In this review a short characterization of the rotifer fauna in different habitats is given, whereby macroenvironments and microenvironments are reported separately. The macroenvironments are classified as follows: 'harmonious' lakes and ponds, arctic and antarctic waters, hot springs, hypertrophic-saprobic environments, mires, strongly acidic waters, saline waters, temporary water bodies, subterranean waters, running waters, oceans, terrestrial environments. The following microenvironments are distinguished: macrophytes (housing periphytic rotifers), open water (with planktic forms), minerogenous sediments (with psammon and hyporheos), organogenous sediments, other organisms (i.e. parasites and epizoans). Many rotifers are more or less euryecious, while relatively few are strongly restricted in their choice of habitat. In extreme environments a low number of species is found, but often a high number of individuals within these species. These rotifers are usually primary consumers, and for natural reasons extreme environments are characterized by a low number of trophic levels. In environments with a high species number the separate species differ very much in their morphology, making it difficult to find common traits which may be interpreted as adaptations to the respective habitats. The most apparent adaptations ought to be found among the planktic rotifers, and these adaptations seem to constitute largely a protection against predators. Rotifers in extreme environments are usually not very apart in a morphological or taxonomical respect, with their most close relatives living in 'normal' habitats and sometimes euryecious (an apparent exception from this rule is formed by the class Seisonidea). Adaptations to deviating chemical and physical environments may develop relatively rapidly (seen from a geological perspective), while the more fundamental changes (occurring during a longer period of time) seem to be a response to biotic factors (e.g., the development of different types of trophi for facilitating food collection).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 3	1995	313						267	278		10.1007/BF00025959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025959													WOS:A1995TR66600036

Study focus: Water resources in Mongolia, which have been poorly studied to date, are limited and unevenly distributed, with the contribution of glacier meltwater being unknown. We simulated the runoff in three river basins in western Mongolia that receive glacier meltwater. ERA5 reanalysis data were evaluated using observations at 28 meteorological stations, and then the glacier meltwater and river runoff were simulated using statistically downscaled ERA5 reanalysis data and three models: an energy-mass-balance model for glaciers, a land-surface process model for ice-free terrain, and a river runoff model to combine the runoff from the two terrains. The simulated runoffs are validated with observations at 34 hydrological stations. New hydrological insights for the region: The glacier meltwater contribution, which is first quantitatively evaluated, is substantial in the Khovd River basin, occurs only in some sub-basins of the Uvs Lake basin, and is negligible in the Zavkhan River basin. The glacier-free simulation indicates that, if glaciers were to disappear, river runoff would significantly decrease during the summer, with the peak flow shifting 1-2 months earlier compared to the present day. The glacier meltwater contribution to river runoff exhibits a nonlinear relationship with the glacier area contribution, which is much greater than that found in a previous study for Tien Shan, suggesting that shrinking ice mass would supply larger amounts of water. Analyses of correlation and extremes suggest that runoff from glacierized catchments responds differently than runoff from glacier-free terrains and thus would compensate for a water deficit caused by a warm and dry environment by supplying glacier meltwater, and vice versa.

J	Christou, A; Bailey, M				Christou, A; Bailey, M			Negative report of occultation by the D-type asteroid (773) Irmintraud	OBSERVATORY												Stellar occultations by solar-system objects (asteroids and satellites) constitute a method of determining the sizes and shapes of large samples of these bodies using small-aperture instruments to a level only otherwise achievable, in some cases, by a few large-aperture, ground-based, adaptive-optics facilities or the Hubble Space Telescope(1). They are also a means of testing the astrometric precision of their ephemerides(2) and the physical properties of their extant atmospheres(3). During an occultation, which is a time-critical phenomenon, the asteroid-to-star geometry projects a narrow, roughly cylindrical shadow track onto the surface of the Earth, within which the star is briefly occulted. An observing team of twelve staff and students, including summer students, was divided into three groups: John McFarland, Bebe Ishak, Anne O'Leary, Mark Purver.- Apostolos Christou, David Asher, Chia-Hsien Lin, Eleanor Nolan. and Mark Bailey, Jonathan McAuliffe, Sharon McClure, Ciara Quinn. On the evening Of 2004 July 20, they travelled approximately too miles west of Armagh to observing locations west of Sligo, Ireland, each close to the centre of the predicted shadow track, and separated from each other by a few miles. The aim was to observe, using small telescopes and binoculars, the predicted occultation of the magnitude-6 - 5 star 31 Psc (= HD 224995 = HIP 186) by the D-type minor planet (773) Irmintraud (diameter c. 95 km) at approximately 01: 19:22 UT on 2004 July 2 1. Not only was this a rare occultation of a fairly bright star, but it has been suggested(4) that Irmintraud could be a representative of a rare class of meteorite parent body similar to that which produced the extremely primitive Tagish Lake meteorite(5).																			0029-7704					FEB	2005	125	1184					23	24																WOS:000227236100002

Three years later, when the released whitefish were expected to become sexually mature, whitefish were sampled from the lakes near the spawning time to evaluate their reproductive and physiological status. In the circumneutral lake, 72% of the captured whitefish were mature, while in the moderately acidic lake all seven captured fish were immature. Among the 27 captured whitefish in the highly acidified lake, all except one were mature. However, the ovaries of two of the 11 females (18%) contained a high proportion of atretic oocytes, and only 54% of the males had running milt compared with 94% in the circumneutral lake. This deterioration of gonadal maturation had probably resulted from physiological stress caused by the high Al and low Ca2+ concentration in the acidic water, which also appeared as a disturbed ion balance, an increased blood glucose and haemoconcentration, and a low length increment in relation to the weight increase. Apart from the imbalance in the length and weight increase, the results of the present study are consistent with those from laboratory experiments. By interfering with whitefish physiology, the acidification of freshwater lakes may also impair their reproduction.

Updating "Sub-hourly water temperature data collected across the Nechako Watershed, 2019-2021" to 2024 and with supplemental sites	DATA IN BRIEF												This paper provides an update to a previously published data article [1] and associated dataset [2] describing a fully revised and expanded water temperature dataset for the 47,200 km2 Nechako Watershed of northern British Columbia, Canada. Compared to our prior effort, we expanded the number of measurement sites from 25 in 2021 to 32 in 2024. Both previous and new sites record water temperature in the regulated part of the Nechako Watershed and many of its unregulated tributaries. The updated dataset is fully quality-controlled and homogenized across all sites. This dataset relies on a network of in-situ monitoring stations initiated in 2019 across the Nechako Watershed. To date, 32 stations collect water temperature at 15-min intervals for three lakes, 11 creeks, and 18 river sites. Data collection for all sites is generally year-round, which captures extended periods near or at the freezing mark. The associated metadata reports the station's condition, any issues, the duration of the collection, and concerns/recommendations for the data analysis. The updated dataset can be used for establishing the impacts of hydrometeorological extreme events on water temperatures [3], hydrothermal modeling for climate change studies [4,5], assessing the efficacy of the Nechako River's Summer Temperature Management Program [6], and for water quality and aquatic habitat suitability analyses [7,8].

In this study, we studied six genera and eleven species of freshwater mussels of the family Unionidae from the Upper Miocene Liushu Formation of the Xunhua Basin. These genera include Unio, Acuticosta, Anodonta, Cristaria, Lanceolaria and Ptychorhynchus. The fossils not only enhance our understanding of biological diversity on the Miocene Tibetan Plateau but also shed light on the biological response to Late Cenozoic orogenic uplift and environmental changes. The Unionidae family is present in modern China mainly in freshwater lakes on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, i.e., in a humid subtropical monsoonal climate, and it has been extinct in northwestern China (including Qinghai Province) since the Late Miocene. This modern distribution implies that environmental conditions in the Xunhua Basin during the Late Miocene were substantially more humid than at present. Such a sharp contrast in habitat to that of the modern Xunhua Basin implies that a Late Miocene climate shift on the NE Tibetan Plateau occurred after 8.2 Ma, i.e., a climatic drying and cooling trend triggered both by regional tectonic uplift and global climate change, which significantly impacted freshwater ecosystems in the Xunhua Basin.

J	Wang, W; Wan, M; Li, M; Mima, C; Wang, T; Zhong, HZ				Wang, Wei; Wan, Min; Li, Ming; Mima, Ciren; Wang, Tao; Zhong, Haozhong			Quantifying the impact of urbanization on wet deposition over Xiong'an New Area in northern China	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Xiong'an New Area (XNA) in China is undergoing rapid urbanization due to economic development and population growth. However, the urbanization process can significantly impact the local environment. This study applied a combined method of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and empirical calculations to quantitatively identify changes in precipitation and wet deposition over XNA and its internal lake, Baiyangdian (BYD), during the summer months of June to September. Five different urbanization scenarios were established by varying the WRF subsurface conditions. By comparing these scenarios with historical observations, it was found that WRF simulations could effectively reproduce the precipitation and temperature changes in the region. This study examined how different levels of urbanization affect precipitation and estimated changes in PM2.5 wet deposition. The study's results indicate that as urbanization increases, it leads to an increase in precipitation and wet deposition in the XNA region. Using the relatively low urbanization level in 1980 as a benchmark for comparison, it was observed that when XNA becomes fully urbanized, the increase in precipitation and wet deposition in the region exceeds 7%. The BYD Lake can have a moderating effect on the environment, absorbing more than 50% of the local precipitation and PM2.5 wet deposition with less than 25% of its area, compared to the XNA interval of the statistics, while the increase in wet deposition in the BYD Lake area is more than 4% after full urbanization in XNA. The findings also emphasize the importance of the need to balance economic growth and environmental protection in urban planning and development.

J	Nixdorf, B; Mischke, U; Rücker, J				Nixdorf, B; Mischke, U; Rücker, J			Phytoplankton assemblages and steady state in deep and shallow eutrophic lakes - an approach to differentiate the habitat properties of Oscillatoriales	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ecological conditions and phytoplankton succession in two shallow hypertrophic lakes (Langer See and Melangsee) and a dimictic, eutrophic lake (Scharmutzelsee) in a lake chain in Eastern Germany were analyzed from 1999 to 2001 in order to find situations of phytoplankton steady state assemblages and variables controlling the phytoplankton composition according to Reynolds et al. (2002). Long term background data from 1993 to 2001 suggest steady state conditions in shallow lakes, whereas the deep lake exhibited irregular fluctuations between various phytoplankton stages. Since the phytoplankton composition in the shallow lakes was similar in all the 3 years, it was highly predictable. Steady state conditions dominated by different species of Oscillatoriales were detected during the summer period 1999 and 2000 in Langer See and in Melangsee (see Mischke & Nixdorf, this volume). This dominant assemblage found in both lakes (group S-1 acc. to Reynolds et al., 2002): Planktothrix agardhii (Gom.) Anagn. et Kom., Limnothrix redekei (Van Goor) Meffert, Pseudanabaena (Lauterb.) is typical in turbid mixed layers with highly light deficient conditions, but it is also regularly dominant in the dimictic lake Scharmutzelsee as observed in 1999 and 2001 (Pseudanabaena limnetica (Lemm.) Kom. The Nostocales Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Wolz.) Seenayya et Subba Raju and Aphanizomenon gracile (Lemmerm.) Lemmerm. were important in the shallow lakes as well as in lake Scharmutzelsee. Nevertheless, the occurrence of filamentous cyanobacteria in the dimictic lake was not regular and an unpredictable change in phytoplankton development was observed in 2000. It is discussed, whether this phenomenon of regular succession in shallow hypertrophic lakes is caused by adaptation to a resilient and an extreme environment or by the pool of species that can live or survive in that environment. This was checked through comparison of the depth of the mixed layer, the mean daily irradiance within this layer and the nutrient resources. Although the nutrient resources in both types of lake are near threshold levels, indicating growth inhibition by dissolved nutrients (DIP, DIN, TIC, DSi), the under water light supply seems to be the key factor favoring the dominance of filamentous cyanobacteria belonging to the functional group S-1.

J	Shanmugam, G				Shanmugam, G.			A global satellite survey of density plumes at river mouths and at other environments: Plume configurations, external controls, and implications for deep-water sedimentation	PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT												The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has archived thousands of satellite images of density plumes in its online publishing outlet called 'Earth Observatory' since 1999. Although these images are in the public domain, there has not been any systematic compilation of configurations of density plumes associated with various sedimentary environments and processes. This article, based on 45 case studies covering 21 major rivers (e.g., Amazon, Betsiboka, Congo [Zaire], Copper, Hugli [Ganges], Mackenzie, Mississippi, Niger, Nile, Rhone, Rio de la Plata, Yellow, Yangtze, Zambezi, etc.) and six different depositional environments (i. e., marine, lacustrine, estuarine, lagoon, bay, and reef), is the first attempt in illustrating natural variability of configurations of density plumes in modern environments. There are, at least, 24 configurations of density plumes. An important finding of this study is that density plumes are controlled by a plethora of 18 oceanographic, meteorological, and other external factors. Examples are: 1) Yellow River in China by tidal shear front and by a change in river course; 2) Yangtze River in China by shelf currents and vertical mixing by tides in winter months; 3) Rio de la Plata Estuary in Argentina and Uruguay by Ocean currents; 4) San Francisco Bay in California by tidal currents; 5) Gulf of Manner in the Indian Ocean by monsoonal currents; 6) Egypt in Red Sea by Eolian dust; 7) U.S. Atlantic margin by cyclones; 8) Sri Lanka by tsunamis; 9) Copper River in Alaska by high-gradient braid delta; 10) Lake Erie by seiche; 11) continental margin off Namibia by upwelling; 12) Bering Sea by phytoplankton; 13) the Great Bahama Bank in the Atlantic Ocean by fish activity; 14) Indonesia by volcanic activity; 15) Greenland by glacial melt; 16) South Pacific Ocean by coral reef; 17) Carolina continental Rise by pockmarks; and 18) Otsuchi Bay in Japan by internal bore. The prevailing trend in promoting a single type of river-flood triggered hyperpycnal flow is flawed because there are 16 types of hyperpycnal flows. River-flood derived hyperpycnal flows are muddy in texture and they occur close to the shoreline in inner shelf environments. Hyperpycnal flows are not viable transport mechanisms of sand and gravel across the shelf into the deep sea. The available field observations suggest that they do not form meter-thick sand layers in deep water settings. For the above reasons, river-flood triggered hyperpycnites are considered unsuitable for serving as petroleum reservoirs in deep-water environments until proven otherwise.																			2096-4803	1876-3804				AUG	2018	45	4					640	661		10.1016/S1876-3804(18)30069-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1876-3804(18)30069-7													WOS:000438979200007

This study evaluated the individual and combined impacts of integrating Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2), Daily Surface Weather Data (Daymet), World Weather for Water Data Services (W3S), crop rotation layer based on multiple cropland data layers (CDLs), an evapotranspiration (ET) data set from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) products, and a snowmelt data set from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) into SWAT on simulations of discharge, sediment and phosphorus at monthly and daily time steps for the Silver Creek watershed (105 km2) and Roy Creek watershed (11 km2), two subwatersheds of the Big Green Lake watershed, Wisconsin. The baseline SWAT utilized Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D) for weather and a single-year CDL for land use. Integrating Daymet only outperformed other data sets in overall simulation accuracy of monthly and daily discharge, while maintaining accuracy in sediment and phosphorus simulation. Integrating crop rotation layer, ET, and snowmelt data sets improved monthly SWAT discharge simulation. The combined integration of Daymet, crop rotation, ET, and snowmelt data sets slightly improved or lowered the monthly SWAT accuracy of discharge, sediment, and phosphorus simulations compared with the integration of Daymet only while reducing uncertainty, showing mixed effects of integrating multiple data sets. Compared with MODIS ET data, uncalibrated SWAT underestimated summer ET peaks. The baseline calibration of monthly SWAT delayed snowmelt peaks. Results suggest that further improvement of crop rotation and snowmelt simulation are required to improve the daily SWAT model performance.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				JUN 1	2025	30	3							04025011	10.1061/JHYEFF.HEENG-6323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JHYEFF.HEENG-6323													WOS:001467951900003

The metropolitan area of St.Petersburg together with the Leningrad Oblast produces annually about 112 000 tons of plastic wastes. Due to no centralized system of plastic litter separation and treatment all wastes are stored in landfills, with much of it eventually finding its way to the adjacent waters (rivers, lakes and the sea) and migrating through the borders. Great amount of litter is accumulated on the beaches of the Gulf of Finland. At the same time the water area of the Gulf can serve itself as a source of beach pollution by plastic particles released from bottom sediments during repeated dredging works in the Neva Bay. The plastic litter problem has never been investigated for the Russian sector of the Gulf and also requires joint efforts from the neighbor countries (Estonia). The study presents a review of marine macrolitter monitoring methods for the beaches of the Eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. For now there is no single method elaborated for beach monitoring of marine litter for European water bodies. Based on the results of recent studies in the central part of the Baltic, analysis of beach and coast types in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland, and results of public monitoring campaigns the most suitable method is discussed to be tested in summer 2018 in several urban and rural spots along the coastline of the Neva estuary, the Kurortny District and the Southern coast of the Gulf.

Simulation of human effects on bull trout population dynamics in rimrock reservoir, Washington	STATUS, DISTRIBUTION, AND CONSERVATION OF NATIVE FRESHWATER FISHES OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Status, Distribution, and Conservation of Native Freshwater Fishes of Western North America	MAR 01-03, 2004	Salt Lake City, UT	Amer Fisheries Soc				A life cycle model was employed to identify the response of an adfluvial bull trout Salvelinus confluentus population to chronic and catastrophic losses of subadults. The model simulates the bull trout population within Rimrock Lake, Washington, a reservoir on the Tieton River impounded by Tieton Dam. Subadult bull trout are entrained during summer water releases for irrigation, and the dam has no fish passage facilities to enable those fish to return upstream. Suitable spawning and rearing habitat is primarily upstream of the dam. Tagging studies of adult bull trout passing weirs in the two major tributaries to the reservoir were used to estimate model parameters for survival, maturity rates, reproductive capacity, and initial abundance. Sampling data and the deterministic model simulations indicated that the population was capable of rebounding quickly from intermittent catastrophic events. Resilience of the bull trout population resulted from high adult longevity and repeat spawning. The accumulation of mature adults across multiple age-classes led to egg deposition that fully seeded rearing capacity of the natal tributaries, even when several consecutive broods of juveniles exhibited poor survival. Catastrophic events simulated to entrain 50% of the subadults every 15 years caused a 40% reduction in adult abundance within 4 years of the event, followed by a full recovery to maximum production within 9 years. Even during the low point of adult abundance, 15 times more eggs were deposited than were needed to fully seed juvenile tributary habitat. Because the population was already producing juveniles at capacity, simulations for opening fish passage over Rimrock Dam showed that the sustained spawner population would increase by only two adults. However, simulations for expanded juvenile habitat by 14% indicated that the sustainable adult population would increase by 14%. Thus, habitat improvements that target juvenile rearing capacity appear to have the greatest potential to increase population size.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-89-6				2007	53						191	+																WOS:000250404400018
J	Colleoni, F; Krinner, G; Jakobsson, M				Colleoni, F.; Krinner, G.; Jakobsson, M.			The role of an Arctic ice shelf in the climate of the MIS 6 glacial maximum (140 ka)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last decade, Arctic icebreaker and nuclear submarine expeditions have revealed large-scale Pleistocene glacial erosion on the Lomonosov Ridge, Chukchi Borderland and along the Northern Alaskan margin indicating that the glacial Arctic Ocean hosted large Antarctic-style ice shelves. Dating of sediment cores indicates that the most extensive and deepest ice grounding occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6. The precise extents of Pleistocene ice shelves in the Arctic Ocean are unknown but seem comparable to present existing Antarctic ice shelves. How would an Antarctic-style ice shelf in the MIS 6 Arctic Ocean influence the Northern Hemisphere climate? Could it have impacted on the surface mass balance (SMB) of the MIS 6 Eurasian ice sheet and contributed to its large southward extent? We use an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) to investigate the climatic impacts of both a limited MIS 6 ice shelf covering portions of the Canada Basin and a fully ice shelf covered Arctic Ocean. The AGCM results show that both ice shelves cause a temperature cooling of about 3 degrees C over the Arctic Ocean mainly due to the combined effect of ice elevation and isolation from the underlying ocean heat fluxes stopping the snow cover from melting during summer. The calculated SMB of the ice shelves are positive. The ice front horizontal velocity of the Canada Basin ice shelf is estimated to approximate to 1 km yr(-1) which is comparable to the recent measurements of the Ross ice shelf, Antarctica. The existence of a large continuous ice shelf covering the entire Arctic Ocean would imply a mean annual velocity of icebergs of approximate to 12 km yr(-1) through the Fram Strait. Our modeling results show that both ice shelf configurations could be viable under the MIS 6 climatic conditions. However, the cooling caused by these ice shelves only affects the Arctic margins of the continental ice sheets and is not strong enough to significantly influence the surface mass balance of the entire MIS 6 Eurasian ice sheet.

J	Kim, JD; Lee, CG				Kim, Jeong-Dong; Lee, Choul-Gyun			Characterization of two algal lytic bacteria associated with management of the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOPROCESS ENGINEERING												Various microorganisms were isolated from the surface waters and sediments of eutrophic lakes and reservoirs in Korea to enable an investigation of bacteria having algal lytic activities against Anabaena flos-aquae when water blooming occurs and to study enzyme profiles of algal lytic bacteria. Two bacterial strains, AFK-07 and AFK-13, were cultured, characterized and identified as Acinetobacter johnsonii and Sinorhizobium sp., respectively. The A. johnsonii AFK-07 exhibited a high level of degradatory activities against A. flos-aquae, and produced alginase, caseinase, lipase, fucodian hydrolase, and laminarinase. Moreover, many kinds of glycosidase, such as beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-glucosaminiclase, and beta-xylosidase, which hydrolyzed beta-O-glycosidic bonds, were found in cell-free extracts of A. johnsonii AFK-07. Other glycosidases such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-N-Ac-galactosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and alpha-L-fucosidase, which cleave alpha-O-glycosidic bonds, were not identified in AFK-07. In the Sinorhizobium sp. AFK-13, the enzymes alginase, amylase, proteinase (caseinase and gelatinase), carboxymethyl-cellulase (CMCase), laminarinase, and lipase were notable. No glycosidase was produced in the AFK-13 strain. Therefore, the enzyme system of A. johnsonii AFK-07 had a more complex mechanism in place to degrade the cyanobacteria cell walls than did the enzyme system of Sinorhizobium sp. AFK-13. The polysaccharides or the peptidoglycans of A. flos-aquae may be hydrolyzed and metabolized to a range of easily utilized monosaccharides or other low molecular weight organic substances by strain AFK-07 of .A. johnsonii, while the products of polysaccharide degradation or peptidoglycans were more likely to be utilized by Sinorhizobium sp. AFK-13. These bacterial interactions may offer an alternative effective approach to controlling the water choking effects of summer blooms affecting our lakes and reservoirs.

Diet was analyzed to determine the relationship between diet quality and the resulting size structure of the cohort. Length-weight and head capsule-weight regressions were used to estimate the dry weight of prey items in the diet. Largemouth bass were divided into 2 size classes (large and small) based on the mean length for each sampling date. Growth rates were calculated for both classes and compared with piecewise linear regression of total length on day of the year with the use of an additional dummy variable. There was a pivotal period in mid-July when there was a divergence in growth rates. The growth rate of small age-0 fish slowed dramatically, while the growth of large age-0 largemouth bass increased. During this period the large age-0 largemouth bass were consuming more prey fishes and fewer insects and zooplankton by weight than were small age-O largemouth bass. After July, small age-0 largemouth bass consumed 2.5 times more prey items and prey of much smaller size than large fish. Early in life, the condition of small age-0 largemouth bass was significantly higher, resulting in the conclusion that small age-0 largemouth bass were possibly allocating more assimilated energy towards growth in weight, while large fish were assimilating more energy towards growth in length. The variation in growth observed within the cohort resulted in a multi-modal length-frequency distribution by the end of the summer.																									2001							175	193																WOS:000184053000017
J	Demirol, F; Cilbiz, M				Demirol, Ferhat; Cilbiz, Mehmet			Stock assessment of endemic tarek ( Alburnus tarichi Güldenstädt, 1814) for the data-poor fishery from Lake Van (Türkiye)	BOLETIM DO INSTITUTO DE PESCA												Alburnus tarichi accounts for about 30% of the annual inland water catch in Turkiye, which is about 33 thousand tonnes. Lake Van is the world's largest alkaline lake and Turkiye's largest lake, at 3,602 km2. Due to the unavailability of detailed data for the data-rich models, the stock ofA. tarichi was assessed by the catch-based maximum sustainable yield (CMSY) model, based on catch data from years 1967 to 2021. The values with their confidence intervals were computed for the Lake Van tarek stock by the CMSY model and are showed as follows: MSY = 12.3 (10.8-14.2) ton *1,000 , k = 92.4(66.5-129)ton*1,000,r =0.536(0.377-0.76)center dot year-1,B2021 =48.0(29.4-55.1)ton*1,000,BMSY =46.2(33.2-64.3)ton*1,000, F 2021 = 0.202 (0.180-0.338)center dot year-1, F MSY = 0.268 (0.189-0.380)center dot year-1, F 2021 /F MSY = 0.772 (0.672-1.260), and B 2021 /B MSY = 1.04 (0.636-1.190). This study revealed that the stock of A. tarichi was subjected to significant and continuously increasing fishing pressure from the early unexploited years (1967-1996) and eventually became overfished in subsequent years (1997-2010). After the prohibition of summer fishing in 1997, which significantly reduced recruitment, the stock began to enter a recovery period in the early 2000s.

The cores were investigated for tephra content and five visible tephras with thickness ranging from 1 to 8 cm were identified. Six additional cryptotephra were identified during the inspection of significant peaks of the magnetic susceptibility curve. Texture and mineralogy of five tephra and six cryptotephra layers were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry system (SEM-EDS) and geochemical measurements were performed by an electron microprobe (EPMA) equipped with five wavelength-dispersive spectrometers (WDS) and using a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) system on single glass shards. The results allowed us to assign tephra and cryptotephra to ten known volcanic eruptions that occurred over the last ca. 60 ka in the Campanian Province (Phlegrean Fields and Ischia Island), the Alban Hills volcanic complex, and Lipari island. In particular, we recognized the deposits of the Monte Epomeo Green Tuff and the Piroclastiti di Catavola eruptions of Ischia, the pre-Campanian Ignimbrite Tlc, the Campanian Ignimbrite and the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff eruptions of the Phlegrean Fields, the Gabellotto-Fiume Bianco eruption of Lipari, and all the four explosive events belonging to the last cycle of volcanic activity of Albano maar (Albano 4-7). Deposits from five of these identified events (i.e., Piroclastiti di Catavola, Gabellotto-Fiume Bianco, Albano 5 and 6 eruptions, and Campanian Ignimbrite) were previously un-reported in the Fucino basin. These findings add new tephra layers to the list of possible tephrochronologic markers in the region and highlight that a comprehensive tephra record may be constructed when the study of cryptotephra layers is included. Moreover, results provide insights into the most recent volcanic activity of Albano maar, allowing us to date the onset of activity at the maar system at ca. 40 ka and to estimate the ages of all four eruptions that made up this eruptive sequence at ca. 37.5 ka (Albano 5), ca. 36.5 ka (Albano 6) and ca. 36 ka (Albano 7), respectively. Our work extends the known dispersal of several major explosive events, suggesting the intensity and magnitude appraisals, and attended risk scenario's need to be revised using improved records of distal fall out.

In consideration of their important role in stratospheric ozone chemistry, some volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs) and trihalomethanes (THMs) were investigated. The analyses were realised with a dedicated system composed by a purge-and-trap injector coupled to a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer (PTI-GC-MS) operating in SIM mode. The investigated VCHCs (chloroform; 1,1,1-trichloroethane; tetrachloromethane; trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene) were present in all analysed samples, and concentration levels ranged from units to hundreds of ngL(-1) according to considered matrix. For the first time, THMs (bromoform; dibromochloromethane; bromodichloromethane), were measured in Antarctic lake waters and freshly deposited snow; their concentration levels ranged from units to tens of ngL(-1). In order to assess eventual temporal variations, VCHC content in aqueous Antarctic matrices was compared with levels occurring in the past Italian Antarctic expeditions: for some banned substances, a decrease in concentration was observed, probably due to worldwide use restrictions. Finally, current Antarctic and Italian VCHC and THM levels in snow and lake water samples were compared and were found to be quite similar, differing at most by one order of magnitude, corroborating the hypothesis of an accumulation of halogenated compounds in Antarctic aqueous matrices.

Implications of rapid changes in chlorophyll-a of plankton, epipelon, and epiphyton in a Pampean shallow lake:: an interpretation in terms of a conceptual model	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th Plankton Symposium	APR, 2007	Joao Pessoa, BRAZIL	Soc Brasileira Planeton, IMAR CIC, Inst Marine Res & CESAM, Univ Aveiro				Biomass assessments of algae in wetlands usually include only the phytoplankton community without considering the contribution of other algal associations to total algal biomass. This omission prevents an accurate evaluation of the phytoplankton community as an integral part of the total ecosystem. In the present work, the biomass contributions (expressed as chlorophyll-a content per m(2) of lake) of phytoplankton, epiphyton on both submerged and emergent macrophytes, and epipelon were measured in Lacombe Lake, Argentina, for the purpose of (1) establishing the relative importance of the phytoplankton and (2) evaluating the entire contribution of algal biomass within the context of the Goldsborough & Robinson conceptual model. Our sampling was carried out monthly for a year in sites representative of different conditions with respect to water depth and type of macrophytes. Physicochemical analyses of water were performed following standard methods. Plankton was collected in a five-level profile at deeper stations and in subsurface samples at the shallow one. Samples of sediment obtained with corers were collected for epipelon sampling and segments of plants were cut at different levels, so as to obtain the epiphytes by scraping. Pigment was extracted with aqueous acetone and calculations were made by means of the Lorenzen equation. According to the Goldsborough & Robinson model, a Lake State developed here during the winter (phytoplankton maxima: 150 mg chlorophyll-a per m(2)). Then, through the subsequent growth of the submerged macrophytes, an Open State was observed, characterized by a maximum epiphyton biomass (at 3,502 mg chlorophyll-a per m(2)) along with lower levels of phytoplankton biomass. The epiphytic algae on the emergent macrophytes were always present but attained only relatively low biomass values (maximum: 120 mg of chlorophyll-a per m(2) in February). The epipelon biomass varied between 50 and 252 mg chlorophyll-a per m(2), registering a considerable contribution of settled algae from the water column (phytoplankton). This study contributes to our knowledge of wetland dynamics through its assessment of the rapid changes in the relative contributions of both planktonic and attached algae to the total algal biomass within the context of specific environmental factors.					; Cano, María/H-9965-2014	Cano, Maria Gabriela/0000-0001-9493-2834; Claps, Maria/0000-0002-7459-3238; 													0018-8158					NOV	2008	614	1					33	45		10.1007/s10750-008-9534-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9534-6													WOS:000259569000004

To explore the links between the mainstem and tributaries and the floodplain, particular efforts were made during five distinct cruises at different stages of the hydrograph between October 2008 and January 2011, to document the spatial and temporal variation of DOC concentrations and delta C-13-DOC in the central Amazon River system (Brazil). Based on more than 200 data, the spatial and temporal variability of delta C-13-DOC values was found to be larger than previously reported in the same area. Although a small range of variation was observed throughout the hydrological cycle in the upper reach of the studied section (-29.2 to -29.5 parts per thousand in the Rio Negro and -28.7 to -29.0 parts per thousand in the Rio Solimoes), a much larger one (-28.0 to -34.6 parts per thousand) was found in the lower reach of the river, as the proportion of open lakes increased downstream in the floodplains. The low variability in the upper reaches suggests constant and homogeneous DOC sources from upland soils and flooded forest, while lower delta C-13-DOC values recorded in the lower reach mainstem at high and falling waters can be attributed to a greater export of plankton-derived C-13-depleted DOC from flooded lakes. Noteworthy are the higher delta C-13-DOC values measured in the Rio Madeira and the associated flooded lakes (-26.5 to -28.8 parts per thousand, which may reflect the imprint from upland headwaters and a weaker density of flooded forest in the watershed. The higher delta C-13-DOC values observed in the lower reach during low waters are still not fully understood. Floating meadows principally consisting of C-4 macrophytes were found to increase delta C-13-DOC values by similar to 1.5 parts per thousand in their vicinity, but this impact was no longer noticeable at distances of similar to 10 m from the plant rafts. This rather modest C-13-enrichment suggests rapid decomposition and/or dilution of this wetland-derived DOC. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

A new but unreliable radiocarbon age is available from Stratum 1 (deposition ending about 11,000 years B.P.; Clovis-age occupation). Thirty-three new radiocarbon ages are available from Stratum 2 and suggest the following refinements to the previously established radiocarbon chronology for the deposit: (1) the intial phase of lacustrin (diatomite) deposition lasted from 11,000 to about 10,500 years B.P. (early Folsom occupation); (2) the first cycle of marsh (organic-rich clay) sedimentation occurred between about 10,500 and 10,200 years B.P. (late Folsom occupation); (3) the substrata 2A-2B contact is not time-transgressive and dates to 10,000 years B.P. or a little less (Plainview occupation); (4) near-shore deposits (substratum 2s) are facies of all or portions of substrata 2A and 2B; (5) eolian sediments (substratum 2e) began to accumulate by 9000 years B.P. (early Firstview occupation); and (6) The Firstview Soil developed in upper substratum 2B beginning about 8500 years B.P. (Firstview occupation) and ended as late as 6300 to 6200 years B.P. (early Archaic occupation), which also would be the age for the beginning of Stratum 3 deposition. Both new and previously reported radiocarbon ages from upper Stratum 3 and lower Stratum 4 suggest that the Yellowhouse Soil formed in Stratum 3 along the valley margins during the period 5500-5000 years B.P. (middle Archaic occupation). At this time along the valley axis, Stratum 3 was eroded and then substratum 4A was depositied as a result of increased spring activity. New radiocarbon ages from charcoal further document human activity at Lubbock Lake during the Protohistoric (Garza) period. The additional radiocarbon ages from Lubbock Lake strengthen the position of the site as one of the best-dated sites in the North America.																			0032-0447						1985	30	110					277	291		10.1080/2052546.1985.11909281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2052546.1985.11909281													WOS:A1985AVP7100001

Life History Traits of Adult Broad Whitefish and Humpback Whitefish	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Broad whitefish Coregonus nasus and humpback whitefish C. pidschian are important to the regional subsistence economy of the Kuskokwim River watershed, Alaska, where they and other whitefish constitute greater than half of the nonsalmon fish harvests. Harvest occurs year-round from lakes, ponds, and the mainstem by subsistence fishermen and through a limited number of commercial permits. Little is known about the life history (e. g., migration patterns) of these species, and subsistence fishers have raised concerns about declining body size and abundance. Project objectives were to 1) characterize annual movement patterns of mature broad whitefish and humpback whitefish, 2) verify suspected spawning locations and locate new spawning locations for broad whitefish and humpback whitefish, 3) describe overwintering locations for broad whitefish and humpback whitefish, 4) characterize age and length at maturity for broad whitefish and humpback whitefish, and 5) characterize the habitat of at least one humpback whitefish spawning area. During 2006-2009, we implanted radiotransmitters in 135 mature broad whitefish and 83 humpback whitefish and tracked movements in the Kuskokwim River drainage. We identified two mainstem spawning areas used by broad whitefish and three tributary spawning areas and one mainstem spawning area used by humpback whitefish. Broad whitefish continued to move into spawning areas under the ice and spawned in late October or early November. Humpback whitefish spawned in early October before the river froze over. Individuals of each species migrated as far as 800 river kilometers to spawning areas. Both species migrated downstream after spawning, overwintered in the mainstem Kuskokwim River, and exhibited fidelity to oxbow and tundra lake feeding areas in the summer. Consecutive year spawning was exhibited by individuals of both species and occurred more frequently in males than females for broad whitefish. The median age (5 y) of broad whitefish captured for radiotagging was younger than ages observed in samples collected from other broad whitefish populations in Alaska and Canada. Only mature humpback whitefish in spawning condition were found during October in suspected spawning areas in the Holitna and Swift rivers.																			1944-687X					JUN	2012	3	1					56	75		10.3996/022011-JFWM-011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/022011-JFWM-011													WOS:000311625900005
J	Kirjavainen, J; Westman, K				Kirjavainen, J; Westman, K			Natural history and development of the introduced signal crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus, in a small, isolated Finnish lake, from 1968 to 1993	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniysculus) originating from Lake Tahoe, California, were introduced into Karisjarvi, a small (11 ha) lake in central Finland (61 degrees 58'N, 25 degrees 32`E), in 1968 and 1969. Since then, the population has been monitored regularly by trap catches. The stocked signals (3-5 years old) were caught until 1973, by which time they had reached ages of 7-9 years. Catches have increased slowly since the early 1980s, the peak occurring in 1991 at 2.0 individuals per trap per night. The population size was estimated as 60 trappable specimens in 1974, 95 in 1981 and 320 in 1988. The mean density of adult population in suitable biotopes was low, 0.07 specimens per m(-2) or 0.3 per share metre, in 1988. The slow development of the P. leniusculus population has been attributed to environmental factors, mainly the limited area of good crayfish habitat. More than 90 % of all signal crayfish were caught in one-third of the shore area, i.e. in steeply sloping lake beds suitable for burrowing or rich in shelters such as rocks and submerged trees. The signals avoided flat, soft bottoms. Fifty per cent of the female P. leniusculus matured at 90 mm TL (smallest 64 mm), i.e. half of the females entered the breeding population in the autunm of their fourth year. The mean size of newly hatched (stage 2) juveniles was 9.7 mm TL and of one-summer olds 30.3 mm. The largest specimen trapped measured 159 mm. The signal crayfish imported into Finland and stocked were infected with crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci), but no mortality has been recorded. Two Branchiobdellidae (Annelida, oligochaeta) epibiont species new to Finland were imported from North America with P. leniusculus. The continuous occurrence of these commensals in the signal crayfish population indicates that they have adapted to Finnish conditions.

The evidence in support is: (1) That at a given epilimnion total phosphorus concentration (TP) the biomass of fish per m(2) is independent of depth, which means that biomass per m(3) is markedly higher in shallow lakes. (2) That the biomass of benthic invertebrates is higher in shallow lakes, which means that the benthi-planktivorous fish are less dependent on zooplankton prey than in deep lakes. By their ability to shift to zooplankton predation their density can remain high even in periods when zooplankton is scarce and they can thereby maintain a potentially high predation pressure on zooplankton. (3) That the possibilities of cladocerans to escape predation by vertical migration are less. (4) That the zooplankton:phytoplankton mass ratio per m(2) is lower and presumably then also the grazing pressure on phytoplankton. (5) That nutrient constraints appear to be weaker, as evidenced by the fact that at a given annual mean TP, summer TP is considerably higher in shallow lakes, especially in eutrophic lakes lacking submerged macrophytes. (6) That negative feedback on cladocerans by cyanobacteria is lower as cyanobacterial dominance is less frequent in shallow lakes and more easily broken (at least in Northern temperate lakes), and (7) That top-down control by benthi-planktivorous fish is markedly reduced in lakes rich in submerged macrophytes because the plants serve as a refuge for pelagic cladocerans and encourage predatory fish at the expense of prey fish. We conclude that manipulation of fish and submerged macrophytes may have substantial impact on lake ecosystems, in particular in shallow eutrophic lakes. On the contrary, if the conditions for more permanent changes in plant abundance or fish community structure are lacking the feed-back mechanisms that endeavour a return to the original turbid state will be particularly strong in shallow lakes.

Since the early isotopic studies on mountainous glaciers in the late 1960s, a great deal of information has been generated on the isotopic composition of rainfall, snow, ice, surface waters, and lake carbonate sediments across the Tibetan Plateau. However, measurements of delta O-18 and delta D values of lake water are scarce. Here we present a new dataset of delta O-18 and delta D values of lake waters collected from 27 lakes across the plateau during a reconnaissance survey in summer 2009. delta O-18 and delta D values of lake water range from -19.9 to 6.6aEuro degrees and from -153 to -16aEuro degrees, respectively. The average values of delta O-18 and delta D are -6.4 and -72aEuro degrees, considerably greater than those of precipitation observed in this region. The derived Tibetan lake water line, delta D = 5.2 delta O-18 - 38.9, is significantly different from the global meteoric water line. Most of the lakes, including some freshwater lakes, contain water with negative values of d-excess (d). There is a negative correlation between d and total dissolved solids (TDS). Each of these findings indicates that evaporation-induced isotopic enrichment prevails in Tibetan lakes. Moreover, we develop an isotope modeling scheme to calculate E/P ratios for Tibetan lakes, using a combination of existing isotopic fractionation equations and the Rayleigh distillation model. We use the intersection of the local evaporation line and GMWL as a first approximation of delta O-18 and delta D values of lake water inputs to infer an E/P ratio for each lake. Our modeling calculations reveal that although variable from lake to lake, the water budget across the plateau is positive, with an average E/P of 0.52. This is in good agreement with other observational and model data that show varying degrees of increases in lake size from satellite imagery and significant decreases in lake salinity in many lakes on the plateau over the last several decades. Together with the new isotopic dataset, the proposed modeling framework can be used to examine and quantify past changes in a lake's hydrologic balance from the isotopic record of downcore carbonate sediments in the region.

Investigating Calico Crayfish (Faxonius immunis Hagen, 1870) as a possible "sleeper" invasive species in northern Wisconsin, United States	AQUATIC INVASIONS												"Sleeper" invaders are non-native populations that experience time-lags post -establishment before subsequent spread or negative impacts, challenging managers to differentiate harmless non-native species from invasive species. In lakes of northern Wisconsin, United States, Rusty Crayfish ( Faxonius rusticus Girard, 1852) has dominated as an invasive species for decades, but this species has recently experienced population declines. Following these F. rusticus declines, we rediscovered in 2020 a population of non-native Calico Crayfish ( Faxonius immunis Hagen, 1870) that had not been documented since the 1970s. Declining F. rusticus populations may create opportunities for F. immunis spread to other lakes and impacts as a sleeper invader. We conducted additional sampling in summer 2021 that suggests F. immunis remains isolated in only one lake within this watershed. We used mitochondrial DNA barcoding to confirm these crayfish were F. immunis and had not been misidentified as a congener. Next, we investigated whether biotic interactions with F. rusticus may have prevented F. immunis spread over the past several decades. We measured agonistic behaviors using F. immunis and F. rusticus pairs in the laboratory, and then modeled differences in aggression between species while controlling for size and reproductive form. We found that F. rusticus were consistently dominant over F. immunis , suggesting that competition with an established hyper -abundant invasive species may have restricted past spread by F. immunis . Managers and policy makers should consider whether precautionary actions against F. immunis are warranted while the population of this species remains small and localized, especially in the context of F. rusticus declines.					; Larson, Eric/P-8253-2016; Hartman, Jordan/AAK-9750-2020	Szydlowski, Daniel/0000-0003-3920-8776; Larson, Eric/0000-0002-9232-5907; Hartman, Jordan/0000-0002-8899-3515													1798-6540	1818-5487				MAY	2024	19	2					191	209		10.3391/ai.2024.19.2.119829	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2024.19.2.119829													WOS:001262145500004

Multiple linear regression (MLR), generalised additive models (GAM) and artificial neural networks (ANN), were used to define young of the year (0+) roach (Rutilus rutilus) microhabitat and to predict its abundance. 2. 0+ Roach and nine environmental variables were sampled using point abundance sampling by electrofishing in the littoral area of Lake Pareloup (France) during summer 1997. Eight of these variables were used to set up the models after log(10) (x + 1) transformation of the dependent variable (0+ roach density). Model training and testing were performed on independent subsets of the whole data matrix containing 306 records. 3. The predictive quality of the models was estimated using the determination coefficient between observed and estimated values of roach densities. The best models were provided by ANN, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.83 in the training procedure and 0.62 in the testing procedure. GAM and MLR gave lower prediction in the training set (r = 0.53 for GAM and r = 0.32 for MLR) and in the testing set (r = 0.48 for GAM and r = 0.43 for MLR). In the same way, samples without fish were reliably predicted by ANN whereas GAM and MLR predicted absence unreliably. 4. ANN sensitivity analysis of the eight environmental variables in the models revealed that 0+ roach distribution was mainly influenced by five variables: depth, distance from the bank, local slope of the bottom and percentage of mud and flooded vegetation cover. The nonlinear influence of these variables on 0+ roach distribution was clearly shown using nonparametric lowess smoothing procedures. 5. Non-linear modelling methods, such as GAM and ANN, were able to define 0+ fish microhabitat precisely and to provide insight into 0+ roach distribution and abundance in the littoral zone of a large reservoir. The results showed Bat in lakes, 0+ roach microhabitat is influenced by a complex combination of several environmental variables acting mainly in a nonlinear way.					; Brosse, Sebastien/AAC-4689-2019	Brosse, Sebastien/0000-0002-3659-8177; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2000	44	3					441	452		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00580.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00580.x													WOS:000088556500007

The recovery of a shallow lake within an agricultural landscape of Minnesota-an interdisciplinary approach to understanding change	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Perleberg DJ, Anderson JP, Streitz AR. 2023. The recovery of a shallow lake within an agricultural landscape of Minnesota-an interdisciplinary approach to change. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX.This case study of Lake Shaokatan, Minnesota, reveals how long-term climate, hydrology, water chemistry, and macrophyte data can explain and predict shallow lake phase shifts. After decades of agricultural landscape nutrient loadings, lake and watershed management efforts successfully reduced summer mean total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations to levels that met standards set specifically for shallow lakes in the Northern Glaciated Plains ecoregion (0.09 mg/L and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). The lake "flipped" from a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated phase (<20% macrophyte occurrence) to a clear, macrophyte-dominated phase (annual average of 90% occurrence), and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency removed it from the state's impaired waters list. A paired groundwater and lake water quality investigation was critical in understanding how increased precipitation might affect lake water quality, the relationship between groundwater and surface water in this system, and how compounds such as chloride and phosphorus are transported through the watershed. Lakewide macrophyte occurrence has been sustained for at least 7 yr. While abundant macrophyte growth helps maintain a clear water state, it can also create recreational boating issues. Lake managers question how long the lake will remain in the present clear phase as lake users weigh the recreational and aesthetic differences between the 2 phases.

Our record suggests that the lake was lower during the Late Pleistocene, in agreement with previous records of lake-level change in East Africa, Following an Early Holocene high stand, during which Lakes Edward and George were connected as one large water body, lake levels dropped as a result of a shift to drier climates, possibly combined with tectonic lowering of the Semliki outlet. This fall in lake level led to the desiccation of Lake George, was accompanied by tectonic activity in the basin, and exposed a >10 m fault scarp associated with the Kasindi Fault Zone. This fault zone divides the basin into a western and an eastern section and the exposed fault scarp caused damming of rivers that entered the basin from the north and northeast, leading to the creation of two separate water bodies. Low Lake Edward in the west, which was a closed lake and where extensive beaches formed along the eastern shore, and Lake Mweya located east of the fault zone. Lake Mweya was at a higher elevation than low Lake Edward and was apparently a well-flushed basin, receiving water from several rivers and possibly draining into low Lake Edward. Sediments deposited during this low stand have different geochemical characteristics, suggesting that limnological conditions in the two basins were different, Lake levels began to rise around 4.5 ka BP, uniting the two lakes and creating modern Lake George some time before 3.6 ka BP. The transgression caused drowning of extensive swamps and marks a change to gradually more lacustrine conditions in the Edward and George basins. There are indications of a shift to a slightly more and climate around 1.7 to 1.8 k-a BP, correlating with climate records from other East African lakes.																					1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						429	470																WOS:000179074600018

Genesis, distribution, and hydrocarbon implications of ostracod-bearing beds in the Songliao Basin (NE China)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Upper Cretaceous Qingshankou Formation (K(2)qn) and Nenjiang Formation (K(2)n) in the Songliao Basin (SLB), China, contain discrete ostracod-bearing deposits. The ostracod-bearing layers range in thickness from 5 to 380cm. Based on integrated analysis of seismic, drilling, core and logging data, the sedimentary characteristics, distribution patterns and hydrocarbon implications of the ostracod-bearing beds have been studied. Compared with mudstone and sandstone in lacustrine settings, ostracod-bearing beds have distinctive characteristics in terms of seismic response and logging features. Three types of depositional pattern of ostracod-bearing beds are recognised in different facies: mixed siliciclastic-ostracod deposits in the delta front, sheeted ostracod deposits, and dotted ostracod deposits in shallow or semi-deep lacustrine settings. In plan view, ostracod-bearing beds mainly occur in the Daqing area, the Longhupao-Honggang terraces and the Heidimiao depression, and are relatively less developed in the east of the SLB. Shallow and semi-deep lacustrine settings were favourable environments for the survival of ostracods. In the stratigraphic succession, ostracod-bearing beds mainly occur in the upper K(2)qn(1), K(2)qn(2), lower K(2)qn(3) and K(2)n(1) units. High-frequency sequence cycles controlled ostracod reproduction and death, and mass mortalities of ostracods commonly occurred during periods in which the lake base-level fell, leading to water shallowing, increasing salinity and sand intrusion into the shore-shallow lakes. Ostracod mortality was not associated with expansion of the lake area, marine transgression or volcanic eruptions. The ostracod-bearing beds were widely formed in shallow and semi-deep lacustrine settings in the SLB. Tight oil/gas reservoirs can be developed in thick ostracod-bearing beds. In addition, areas containing ostracod can be regarded as sweet spots for mud or shale oil/gas exploration, because extensive ostracods can improve the content of brittle minerals in mudstone.																			0812-0099	1440-0952					2017	64	6					793	806		10.1080/08120099.2017.1343205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2017.1343205													WOS:000410856900007
J	Abotalib, AZ; Sultan, M; Elkadiri, R				Abotalib, Abotalib Z.; Sultan, Mohamed; Elkadiri, Racha			Groundwater processes in Saharan Africa: Implications for landscape evolution in arid environments	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleoclimatic regimes over Saharan Africa alternated between dry and wet periods throughout the Pleistocene Epoch, and it is during the wet periods that the Saharan fossil aquifers were recharged. We investigated the role of groundwater-related processes in shaping the Saharan landforms (e.g., theater-headed valleys [THV]; depressions, escarpments, playas, and tufa deposits) over areas occupied by the largest of these aquifer systems, the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS; area: 2.6 million km(2)) in Egypt, Libya, Sudan, and Chad. We reviewed the suggested hypotheses for the origin of these landforms in the Sahara and in similar settings elsewhere and present evidence (remote sensing-based landscape analysis, geostatistical and geospatial analyses, hydrological, lithological, isotopic and field) in support of the following: in Pleistocene wet periods groundwater under high hydrostatic pressures accessed deep-seated structures, discharged at the free faces, THV developed, scarps retreated, fluvial (in wet periods) and aeolian processes (in dry periods) together with seepage weathering eroded and transported loose debris, and depressions were formed. Evidence includes: (1) extensive distribution of THV (stubby-looking geometry, theater-like heads, U-shaped profiles, flat floors, and structurally controlled patterns) indicative of sapping processes were mapped (using a GIS-based logistic regression model) along faulted scarps extending for over 1450 km in the NSAS; (2) widespread distribution of tufa deposits plastered on scarp faces of the natural depressions within the NSAS with isotopic compositions consistent with deposition from NSAS fossil groundwater (delta O-18: -12.8 to -8.0 parts per thousand); (3) absence of well-developed drainage systems over the Libyan Plateau; (4) onset of endorheic streams from the identified THV along the NSAS escarpments (within the Qattara, Kharga, Farafra, and Dakhla depressions) and at the boundary between massive limestone formations (e.g., Gara, Kurkur, and Marmarica) and underlying erodible shale and argillaceous sandstone formations (e.g., Dakhla and Moghra) consistent with a groundwater discharge origin for the endorheic streams; (5) reported carbonate-rich playa deposits within scarp-foot depressions at the terminations of the endorheic streams; (6) artesian upward leakage of depleted NSAS groundwater (delta D: -81 to -72 parts per thousand; and delta O-18: -12.8 to -8.0 parts per thousand) into shallower Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene aquifers (delta D: -0.7 to -7.2 parts per thousand; delta O-18: -1.13 to 1.20 parts per thousand) as evidenced by the mixed isotopic composition (delta D range: -62.6 to -2.6 parts per thousand; delta O-18 range: -7.0 to -1.09 parts per thousand) of groundwater. Understanding the role of groundwater processes in landscape evolution over areas occupied by the NSAS has implications for understanding the development of landscape in Saharan Africa, Arabian Sahara, similar settings worldwide, and the evolution of the Martian landscape.

J	Zhou, JC; Wu, JL; Guo, R; Ji, M				Zhou, Jianchao; Wu, Jinglu; Guo, Ru; Ji, Ming			Holocene hydroclimatic changes inferred from a mountainous lake sedimentary record on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Knowledge of Holocene hydroclimate change is critical to better understand the potential impact of future global climate change on water resources and water-related disaster risks on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Here, we present a high-resolution biogeochemical record from a 20.47 m core from Lake Basongcuo, which was used to infer past hydroclimate fluctuations and related lake evolution changes over the last similar to 7.0 cal kyr. Scanned X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and total organic carbon (TOC) data suggest that the interval similar to 7.00 to 6.05 cal ka BP was marked by warm and wet conditions. The following period, similar to 6.05 to 3.80 cal ka BP, was characterized by lake deepening under moderately warm and wet conditions. Rapid changes in multiple climate proxy variables ca. 3.8 cal ka BP indicated the termination of the warm/wet period at the onset of the Late Holocene. A cooling and drying trend occurred after 3.8 cal ka BP and persisted until an increase in temperature and precipitation began about 0.1 cal ka BP. The Basongcuo record displays similarities to other paleoclimate records from the southern and central TP, suggesting coherent millennial-scale hydroclimate changes across the region that were controlled mainly by the variations in the intensity of the Indian Summer Monsoon and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Eight glacier advance events were identified at 6.4, 5.3, 4.9, 2.7, 2.4, 0.7, 0.3 and 0.11 cal ka BP. Those events closely tracked declines in total solar irradiance, indicating the strong influence of solar activity on centennial-scale climate and environmental fluctuations.					song, baiquan/HGV-1798-2022														1437-3254	1437-3262				JUN	2025	114	4					769	782		10.1007/s00531-025-02514-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00531-025-02514-1		JUN 2025											WOS:001502520500001

Quantification of Snow/Glacier Melt Impacts of Historical and Future Climate Change on Eastern Himalayan River	JOURNAL OF POLYMER & COMPOSITES												Millions of the population on Eastern Himalayan Rivers (EHR) totally depend on, domestic use, agriculture, and hydropower. Several studies found that climate warming threatens this EHR's hydrological regime. In order to understand the hydrologic response of their headwaters and how climate change affects streamflow, a hydrological modeling study is conducted in the Teesta River Basin (TRB) in EHR using an open-source Quantum Geographical Information System (QGIS) with semi- distributed QSWAT1.5 (Soil and Water Assessment Tools). The model performed well in 1985-2015 simulations, warmup period (2001-2002) for calibration (2003-2010) and validation (2011-2015) versus measured daily streamflow at Teesta IV DAM (R2 approximate to 0.87). The study found that snowmelt runoff from a bigger snow-covered area at higher TRB accounts for 62-74% of the average annual water supply of 2000 mm on average 200. Approximately 16% of precipitation is evapotranspiration. Basin water yield is 78% of precipitation, with most generated in early summer from mid-May to September. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data for thirteen models, which ACCESS-ESM1-5 was the most suitable model, which was calculated by the Taylor diagram. CMIP6 has four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs), but the research has used average data to explore how climate change will affect future streamflow. First, calculate monthly discharge for all SSPs but got the same result from all, and model performed well. Global Climate Models (GCM) to Regional Scale Model (RCM) and Quantile Mapping are used to correct bias and load into SWAT to simulate end-of-century stream flows. The region's predicted precipitation and temperature fluctuations showed a wetter and warmer climate.																			2321-8525	2321-2810					2025	13				SI		S508	S524																WOS:001461596000001
J	Bieber, JF; Suski, CD				Bieber, John F.; Suski, Cory D.			Spatial ecology and thermal preferences of muskellunge within a Midwest impoundment	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												Muskellunge are a valuable sportfish species which has been stocked throughout North America. Stocking is a strategy to generate angling opportunities by introducing species to waterbodies that otherwise would not have contained the fish, such as impoundments and reservoirs. Therefore, understanding the ways fish interact with different waterbodies is critical for managers to understand. To that end, we utilized a year-long passive telemetry study with muskellunge in a reservoir known for its muskellunge angling. Additionally, we employed temperature loggers to track lake temperatures. We found that smaller female muskellunge were more resident at sites compared to similar-sized males, although fish did not exhibit site-specific preferences. We also found that fish moved high distances over the course of the year without time-specific differences. Furthermore, we found evidence that muskellunge was selected for thermal refuges in the reservoir; however, in summer, when water temperatures were elevated, fish inhabited water, which has been shown to increase incidental mortality. The results of this study indicate a need for muskellunge managers, especially in reservoirs, to consider water temperature in angling regulations. Additionally, our results highlight a need for adding habitat structure in reservoirs and altering stocking densities of fish. Collectively, these results will help inform managers on muskellunge spatial interactions within a reservoir and achieve management goals. Muskellunge are an important North American sportfish species, and therefore must be properly managed. In a year-long fine-scale telemetry study within a Midwest reservoir, 36 tagged muskellunge were found to move similarly without a locational bias, and can exceed critical thermal thresholds despite use of thermal refuges. image																			2693-8847					JUN	2024	4	3							e169	10.1002/aff2.169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aff2.169													WOS:001214677400001

Gastrointestinal parasite assemblages from the wild rodent capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) inhabiting a natural protected area from Argentina	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												Knowledge about parasitic diseases of wildlife will help us to understand the dynamics of parasites and their effects on host populations. The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent in the world, and its distribution is associated with the presence of tropical and subtropical wetlands in South America. The Los Padres Lake Integral Reserve (LPLIR) is an important conservation zone in the pampean region of Argentina. One of the emblematic species found within the reserve is the capybara. The objective of this study was to determine the gastrointestinal parasites present in wild capybaras of the LPLIR and to compare different coprological methodologies. Free-ranging capybara fresh feces from 57 individuals were randomly collected from the area of LPLIR in the summer of 2022. Three different techniques were applied: spontaneous sedimentation technique (SS), INTA modified McMaster technique (MM), and Mini-FLOTAC (MF) technique. Fifty-six samples from all samples analysed (56/57, 98%) were found to be positive for gastrointestinal parasites. Two species of Strongylida, Protozoophaga obesa, Echinocoleus hydrochaeris, one unidentified nematode, one unidentified spirurid, and at least two morphotypes of Eimeria spp. oocysts were recorded. There were found significant differences in the proportion of positive samples and in richness by technique, but no significant differences were found in parasite counting. In conclusion, the choice of methodology depends on the specific objectives of the study. This is the first parasitological study of capybaras from the LPLIR and represents an exploration of parasite communities present in these wild rodents at their southernmost distribution.

According to geological surveys of 17 lake districts in different locations of the plateau, combined with interpretations of satellite images and topographic maps, the authors studied the tin-Ling of formation and scopes of the pan-lake areas of the plateau and their paleoclimate. The latest two high lake levels (overflow surfaces) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the Quaternary occurred at similar to 40 to 30/35 ka and similar to 65 to 53 ka respectively. In these time intervals, the plateau was covered by huge interconnected pan-lake systems with a total area of similar to 36 km(2) and a total volume 2, times and 659 times larger than those of the modem lakes of lake water of > 530 million km(2) which are about 38 tit respectively. Before this pan-lake period in the late Pleistocene, there had been three high lake levels that occurred at similar to 132-112 ka, 110-95 ka and 91-72/similar to 83-75 ka respectively, suggesting that the late Quaternary climate on the plateau was unstable and changed rapidly. The similar to 40-30 ka high lake level also appeared in the Tengger desert north of the plateau, suggesting that there existed very strong summer monsoons from South Asia then; the variation in solar radiation with a 20,000 precessional period has special importance for the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the low-latitude zone of the Earth. Around 30 ka, the pan-lakes at the peripheries of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau drained out suddenly with rapid uplift of the plateau and cooling. In a short time the huge amount of cold lake water emptied into the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. The draining event of the pan-lakes brought about the environmental changes of rivers and lakes at peripheries of the plateau.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2005	79	6					821	834																WOS:000234441600013

In this study we modeled the impact of three surface water abstraction rates in the epilimnion for drinking water purposes in combination with climate change on the ecological quality and the recreational potential of a quarry lake in The Netherlands. Our results show that the highest surface water abstraction rate (1.36 m3/s) - related to the estimated abstraction rate for 2040 - would substantially change the ecological quality of the lake. Specifically, this surface water abstraction rate caused a threefold extension of the period of hypoxia in the hypolimnion and a reduction of the phytoplankton summer bloom as compared to the baseline. Simultaneously, the reduction of cyanobacteria in the lake due to the surface water abstraction would improve the lake's suitability for recreation, as the risk of harmful blooms becomes negligible. The two lower surface water abstraction rates showed results in between the no-abstraction and the high abstraction rate results. When considering only the changes in the climate between 2010 and 2050, we found that the lake's ecological quality would decrease, mainly due to prolonged hypoxic conditions. However, the recreational potential remained relatively unchanged due to climate change. Overall, our findings indicate that surface water abstraction, in particular at the highest rate, would have a more profound impact on the lake than the projected climate change. Our study highlights the importance of including local water management strategies, such as surface water abstractions, in future water quality simulations.					; Mooij, Wolf/C-2677-2008; Teurlincx, Sven/B-8490-2016	Kramer, Lilith/0000-0002-8523-1259; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP	2025	391								126124	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126124								40609451					WOS:001525910100004

Spatial and inter-annual variation in the Lake Superior offshore zooplankton community	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Superior's offshore zooplankton community is commonly considered spatially homogeneous and relatively invariant, and thus often referenced as a baseline oligotrophic zooplankton community for the Great Lakes. However, zooplankton biomass can indeed exhibit substantial variability in Lake Superior on finer spatial and temporal scales, but this is not well documented in the literature. We used long-term monitoring data generated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes Biology Monitoring Program from 1997 to 2018 to investigate offshore zooplankton community structure during summer stratification. Both cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination were used to examine zooplankton spatial patterns in relation to environmental variables. In addition, we used modeled surface current projections for the weeks prior to sampling events to assess the potential importance of horizontal transport in shaping the offshore zooplankton community. We found that although calanoid copepods consistently dominated the community, the relative contribution of cladocerans to total zooplankton biomass was variable. Cluster analysis often singled out three stations, two north of Isle Royale and one offshore of the Pic River, that typically had both higher chlorophyll-a concentrations and higher cladoceran biomass than most others. Analysis of surface current projections suggested horizontal transport of zooplankton could occur from stations with high cladoceran biomass, possibly driving more widespread shifts in the offshore community than expected.

The samples of lichens of two species Hypogymnia physodes and Evernia mesomorpha were collected in the summer 2015 in the territories adjacent to the Ursk and Komsomolsk tailings in Kemerovo region (Russia). The concentrations of chemical elements in 49 samples were determined by the mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. The results showed higher concentrations of Sb (Cc = 17,4), As (3,3), and Hg (2,5) in the lichens from the Komsomolsk tailings in comparison with the local background values. Maximal concentrations were found in the northeastern direction from the tailings near the lake formed after the mined carrier, where the sulfides have been transformed into other mineral forms due to the hypergenesis process. The chemical elements, containing in these minerals, migrate and pollute all environmental components. The ecological-geochemical specificity of the Ursk tailings consists in the high concentrating by lichens of Ba (Cc = 62), Sb (22), Hg (16), Ag (13,6), Mn (10), Pb (9,3) and As (4,1). This specificity is determined by the waste composition of the Ursk tailing dump formed from the cyanidation of Hg-containing sulfide ores of the Novo-Urskoe deposit. The results of this research testify that the elemental composition of lichens is directly related to the specificity of the matter composition of the tailings from mining and ore processing.																			1314-2704		978-619-7105-66-7				2016							125	132																WOS:000391519600017
J	Granberg, K				Granberg, K			The impact of effluents of Pitkaranta pulp mill on the water quality of Lake Ladoga: A model study	HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol				The aim of this study is to show the effects of the Pitkaranta pulp mill on the water quality of Northern Ladoga by using water quality models. The effluent loading of the pulp mill with its full production capacity is as follows: [GRAPHICS] Loadings of lignosulphonates and organic C are estimations. Lignosulphonate concentrations of 10.5 mg l(-1) have been reported in the region of Pitkaranta. The study area of northern Ladoga near the pulp mill was divided into three zones (I, II and III). The mean depth of each of them is considered as 10 m, their respective areas 5, 10 and 50 km(2), and volumes 50, 100 and 500 million m(3). The estimated discharges of the zones are 10, 20 and 50 m(3) s(-1), respectively. With the aid of simple water quality models the effects of the pulp mill effluents on the concentrations of oxygen, total phosphorus, lignin, COD(Mn) and Secchi disk depths in each of the zones were estimated. Estimations were made during full production capacity and half production capacity of the pulp mill. The modelling results were compared with the preliminary water analysis results of the Finnish-Russian joint research expedition into Lake Ladoga in August 1993. The results show that near the pulp mill (zone I) phosphorus concentrations are high even with half production capacity. Also lignin and COD(Mn) contents have increased, and oxygen concentrations are low both in the summer and during wintertime. Farther away in the open water (zone III) the pollution effects are low. Eutrophication, indicated by high total phosphorus concentrations, is the main effect of the pulp mill effluents.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					159	166		10.1007/BF00031822	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031822													WOS:A1996UT84700026

This study uses high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs (Planet Labs, Inc., San Francisco, CA, United States of America) to understand the extent and severity of the blooms with a time series analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) over the lake using k-means clustering. We distinguish algae blooms from preexisting aquatic vegetation by creating a baseline map of mean aquatic vegetation extent, and subtracting this from each image in the time series. Additionally, results from a principal component analysis conducted on each year's imagery corroborate the k-means finding, and align with spatial trends of bloom events observed in the lake. In this study, normalized difference chlorophyll index values are observed to be more reliable for estimating the severity of algal blooms, while NDVI is more sensitive to glare, haze, thin clouds, and signal over-saturation caused by blooms, aligning with preexisting research findings. We successfully fit a linear regression between NDCI values and in situ measurements of phycocyanin concentrations surrounding AlgaeTracker (TM) buoys (R 2:0.893). Furthermore we highlight bloom extent and severity for 2021 and 2022, revealing potential bloom hotspots in the lake. The methodology in this project can be extended to systematically analyze high-resolution satellite imagery in freshwater ecosystems to detect harmful algae blooms.					; MacKinnon, Roxanne/IQV-2470-2023	Greene, Christopher/0000-0002-3710-3877; 														2673-6187				AUG 18	2025	6								1633491	10.3389/frsen.2025.1633491	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2025.1633491													WOS:001563579800001

Macro- and micronutrient effects on phytoplankton in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, and the western basin of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Efforts to reduce the frequency, extent, and toxicity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) require knowledge about drivers of algal growth, toxin production, and shifts in phytoplankton community composition to cyanobacterial dominance. Although labile nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fuel primary production, micronutrients also play roles as the enzymatic engines that facilitate rapid and efficient growth and toxin production. Macro- and micronutrient availability can shape community composition and function by selecting for particular taxa. To address how phytoplankton in two Great Lakes subbasins respond to macro- and micronutrients, we conducted bottle incubation enrichment experiments using water collected from two blooming and two nonblooming sites in Lakes Erie and Michigan during late summer (August). Three of the four sites exhibited multi-nutrient limitation of growth. Both blooming sites responded strongest to NH4+ enrichment. Both nonblooming sites responded the strongest to PO43- enrichment, and three of the four sites responded in some way to a mix of micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Zn). Microcystis aeruginosa relative abundance increased most with N enrichment, while P enrichment increased the abundance of diatoms and chlorophytes. At the Fox River, N-enriched communities grew 10%-20% more than non-N enriched communities (measured as chlorophyll a), and N-enriched communities had, on average, over twice as much microcystin (non-N communities average MC = 2.45 mu g center dot L-1, +N communities MC = 5.35 mu g center dot L-1). These overarching trends support the idea that control of HABs may not be effective with a P-only approach.

In this area, 24,782 lakes each with an area of >10,000 m(2) were digitized from Google Earth satellite imagery, and four categories of lakes and drained lake basins were identified in two sub-study areas from Sentinel 2 imagery. Regionally, the lakes show a single modal orientation east-west to ESE-WNW, which is broadly parallel to the prevailing wind from 80 to 90 degrees recorded at the nearest meteorological stations during June-October, when the lakes are likely to have been partially or completely ice-free and therefore exposed to wave-induced currents. Regression analysis suggests that lake orientation tends to be strongest in flatter terrain (<1 degrees) that is not formed in silt- and ice-rich yedoma deposits. Locally, however, two sub-study areas show two modes of almost equal size, with lakes and basins aligned ESE-WNW or NNE-SSW, and thus approximately either parallel to or perpendicular to prevailing winds. Local deviation from the ESE-WNW lake alignment in the sub-study areas is attributed to a sandy substrate and topographic control. Sandy substrates appear to favour perpendicular orientations, whereas elongate depressions aligned broadly east-west, and supporting meandering rivers, favour parallel orientations. Overall, therefore, the impact of prevailing summer wind direction on lake and basin orientation is moderated by environmental factors of topography and substrate.

Ancient plant DNA reveals High Arctic greening during the Last Interglacial	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Summer warming is driving a greening trend across the Arctic, with the potential for large-scale amplification of climate change due to vegetation-related feedbacks [Pearson et al., Nat. Clim. Chang. (3), 673-677 (2013)]. Because observational records are sparse and temporally limited, past episodes of Arctic warming can help elucidate the magnitude of vegetation response to temperature change. The Last Interglacial ([LIG], 129,000 to 116,000 y ago) was the most recent episode of Arctic warming on par with predicted 21st century temperature change [Otto-Bliesner et al., Philos. Trans. A Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. (371), 20130097 (2013) and Post et al., Sci. Adv. (5), eaaw9883 (2019)]. However, high-latitude terrestrial records from this period are rare, so LIG vegetation distributions are incompletely known. Pollen-based vegetation reconstructions can be biased by long-distance pollen transport, further obscuring the paleoenvironmental record. Here, we present a LIG vegetation record based on ancient DNA in lake sediment and compare it with fossil pollen. Comprehensive plant community reconstructions through the last and current interglacial (the Holocene) on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada, reveal coherent climate-driven community shifts across both interglacials. Peak LIG warmth featured a similar to 400-km northward range shift of dwarf birch, a key woody shrub that is again expanding northward. Greening of the High Arctic-documented here by multiple proxies-likely represented a strong positive feedback on high-latitude LIG warming. Authenticated ancient DNA from this lake sediment also extends the useful preservation window for the technique and highlights the utility of combining traditional and molecular approaches for gleaning paleoenvironmental insights to better anticipate a warmer future.

The contractor was asked to come up with a design and to carry out the works of which the eventual result shall be judged afterwards, on the basis of contractually agreed water quality standards to be achieved. If these criteria are not achieved by the end of a period of 2 years and guaranteed for a further period of 5 years, the contractor shall pay a penalty. May one require from a contractor that he is willing to accept a number of specifications that are broadly governed by nature only, irrespective of the "Design and Build" character of the contract? Is, for these specific set of conditions, just "doing one's best" not enough? And is this type of contract trendsetting for future "environmental" works? To answer these questions, first of all a review will be given of the struggle between Client and Contractor concerning the ultimate water quality criteria which had to be applied. Subsequently a closer look will be made into general, contractual clauses and expressions as used today with respect to risk management aspects. Examples of the variety of descriptions of risk phenomena will be collected and finally a model for "how to deal with certainties" will be presented. It gives the decision maker a tool to classify more easily risks so that both Client en Contractor can decide on beforehand how they shall share risks in the project to execute.																			1462-6098		1-85312-977-1				2003	9						481	493																WOS:000189463800047

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON HYDROPOWER GENERATION AT KENYIR LAKE	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Climate change is triggered by human activities that produce greenhouse gas emissions and affect people in various ways. It is crucial to study the severity of rainfall in the certain potential areas that exposed to hydro-meteorological disasters in climatic trends transition. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the severity of rainfall trends and also to predict the fluctuations of hydropower generation in Kenyir Lake triggered by the variations of climatic factors under selected Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) suggested in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fifth assessment report. The historical daily data of seven rainfall stations for 30 years' period (1988 - 2017) and global climate model data for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 also for 30 years' period (2041-2070) were used. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was used to analyse the data. The predicted rainfall data from 2041 to 2070 then compared with the base period rainfall (1988-2017). Kenyir Lake received highest amount of rainfall in November to January during north-east monsoon. The significance differences were recorded in November and December where abrupt fall of rainfall distribution predicted to happen for all RCPs. The results proved that the higher emissions level will give the more effect to the climate trend as previous researcher found that warming will remain beyond 2100 for all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. The lowest generated value at Kenyir is in 1997 and the highest value is in 2017. The increment of NUG clearly happens in 10 years' interval where there was 78.67% of increment in 2007 compared to 1997. There is an increase that occurs although there are fluctuations every year. Increases in temperature because of climate change effects will increase the energy demand. Rising temperatures gives the varies patterns of demand because higher temperature will create higher cooling demand. Besides that, power generation can change accordingly by the decreasing stream flow and increasing water temperature. It shows that climate change tremendously affects the energy demand patterns and supply systems.

J	Bodnár, E; Polyák, K; Hlavay, J				Bodnár, E; Polyák, K; Hlavay, J			Material transport between the atmosphere and sediment of the Lake Balaton	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL					11th Italian-Hungarian Symposium on Spectrochemistry	OCT 20-24, 2003	Venice, ITALY					A monitoring system was developed to gain information on the present level of pollutants in the Lake Balaton, Hungary. Determination of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and inorganic pollutants (mostly toxic metals) in aerosol, precipitation and sediment samples was carried out. The aim of collecting aerosol and precipitate samples in the same site at the same period was to determine the distribution of elements in two depositions. For the fractionation by particle size, aerosols were sampled by a cascade impactor. A simple three-stage sequential leaching procedure was applied to establish the distribution of metals among environmentally mobile, bound to carbonates and oxides, and environmentally immobile, (bound to silicates) fractions in aerosols. Sediment samples were collected from 17 different sites inside of the lake and 10 sites at harbors at 30-70 cm in depth. Core samples were cut to 10-cm pieces, dried at room temperature, and finally passed through a 63-mum sieve. Total concentrations of elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) after an acidic digestion. The concentrations of PAHs were determined by HPLC method with fluorescence detection. In aerosol samples collected from September 6, 2002 to January 26, 2003, concentration of Cd was <0.1 mug/m(3) and the majority of Cd has been found in the mobile fraction. Cadmium was associated to particles between 0.25 and 2 mum indicating the anthropogenic origin. Similar distribution of Pb was obtained in all seasons, and the highest concentration of Pb was found as 8.6 ng/m(3) in particle size of 0.7 and 1.4 mum. Results of total concentration of elements of bottom sediments of the Lake Balaton and harbors were compared to Interim Sediment Quality Guideline (ISQG) values and the Probable Effect Level (PEL) values. Data showed that the average concentrations of elements were usually less than those of ISQGs and other background data for soils and geochemical values. The sediment is not polluted and its disposal is feasible. There is no direct correlation between the concentration of elements deposited onto the surface of the lake from dry and wet deposition and the upper part of the sediment. So, from the budget of the deposition, the concentration of elements in the upper layer of the sediment cannot be predicted. Seasonal changes of the concentration of PAHs in aerosol was observed, samples collected at winter contained the highest values. In December-January 2002/2003, the wet deposition was found as 64 mug/m(2) period. Among the individual compounds, the wet deposition rate of phenantrane, fluoranthene and pyrene was dominant, while for dry deposition, these compounds were fluoranthene and pyrene. The concentrations of SigmaPAHs found for all sites and depth of sediment samples ranged from 11 to 1734 mug/kg dry weight with an average of 132 mug/kg. These values represent a quite low pollution level compared to other sediment with anthropogenic influence. Based on the results, it can be definitely confirmed that the chemical quality of the water and sediment of the Lake Balaton is satisfactory.

Among the harmful cyanobacteria, Planktothrix, a resilient and toxin-producing filamentous cyanobacterium, has garnered increasing attention. However, an understanding of the entire microbiome, particularly the phycosphere surrounding Planktothrix blooms, remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study combining 16S rDNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to elucidate Planktothrix bloom microbiomes and identify potential microbial or functional biomarkers for CyanoHABs. Our observations revealed that a summer bloom in Grand Lake St. Marys was initiated with Dolichospermum and then shifted to Planktothrix dominance. This transition was associated with nitrogen metabolism genes, suggesting that nitrogen plays a key role in bloom persistence through interactions among nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea, anammox bacteria, and denitrifiers. Additionally, metagenomic data revealed a strong positive correlation of toxin concentration with carbohydratenitrogen-sulfur-fatty acid associated metabolic pathways and a strong negative correlation with pollutant degradation pathways. Intriguingly, diazotrophic methane-related microbes were detected, which opens discussion on potential symbiosis that couples nitrogen and carbon metabolism. Toxin-degrading bacteria, such as Polynucleobacter and Acidovorax, were positively correlated with fungi like Vishniacozyma, proposing their cooperative roles during bloom events. Notably, Rhodobacter, a photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacterium, showed strong negative correlations with both Planktothrix and the toxin-producing gene mcyE, positioning it as a promising biomarker for early bloom detection. Overall, this study advances the understanding of Planktothrixdominated bloom ecology and highlights microbial signatures for proactive CyanoHAB management in freshwater systems.

Here, we reconstruct carbon mass accumulation rates for organic and inorganic carbon since 13 ka BP in Rotsee, a perialpine lake near the Swiss Alps, using a 12-m sediment core. A multiproxy approach (XRF, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, organic macromolecule chemical compositions, aDNA) was used to explore changes in the lake system that affect sedimentary carbon storage. The Early Holocene (11.8-7 cal ka BP) was characterized by a mixed phytoplankton and watershed-derived provenance of organic matter, and the deposition of inorganic and organic sedimentary carbon. Warming during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (9.8-8.8 cal ka BP) increased sedimentary carbon storage. In the Mid- to Late Holocene (7-1 cal ka BP), the sedimentary record indicates an increased influx of allochthonous, vascular plant-derived organic matter, and low production or conservation of phytoplankton-derived carbon. Organic carbon storage increased, while inorganic carbon became negligible. Larger deforestation events, potentially during Neolithic times (around 4 ka BP), but especially during Roman times (2 ka BP), coincided with further increased organic carbon MARs. Recent sediments, influenced by eutrophication in the last century, show higher carbon accumulation rates compared to earlier Holocene periods. Rotsee serves as a case study of how climate warming and human land use changes have influenced lake development and sedimentary carbon6 storage, with broader implications for understanding carbon dynamics in high altitude lakes and their future carbon balance.

Numerous archaeological sites have been reported on the plateau, except in its southeastern part. This study presents new archaeological findings from the Congqiancuo area in southeastern Tibet, located in the Haizishan Mountain region, a glacial landscape. Lithic artifacts, including small-sized flake tools and micro- blades, were discovered on the surface and in a test pit within the low terrace of Congqiancuo Lake, a moraine- dammed lake. Excavation revealed a 1.3-m stratigraphy with four layers, with artifacts found in Layers 3 and 2. Luminescence dating of quartz and K-feldspar grains, along with radiocarbon dating of charcoal, provided age estimates. The luminescence dating results were consistent across quartz and K-feldspar grains, while radiocarbon ages on charcoal were anomalously young. Bayesian statistical modeling refined the luminescence ages, yielding a date of 17.7 +/- 1.9 ka for Layer 4, indicating human occupation shortly after the glaciers receded at 18.1 +/- 1.4 ka. Cultural layers (Layers 3 and 2) were deposited between 13.8 and 4.2 ka, with the earliest human presence suggested around 11.8 ka. Sediment analysis of grain size and magnetic susceptibility reveals that humans likely inhabited the lake shore during a warmer climate, highlighting southeastern Tibet as a crucial settlement area post-Last Glacial Maximum and a potential route for the spread of microblade technology in high-altitude regions.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 1	2025	667								112878	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112878		MAR 2025											WOS:001449954200001

However, fire records over geological time scales are still scarce in the high latitudes of NH to provide comprehensive pictures of the fire history in this region. Here, we used the flux of levoglucosan (Lev) and its isomers in a sediment profile YN from Svalbard, high Arctic, as proxies for the changes in biomass burning from -9-2 kyr BP (thousand years before present). Backward trajectories and comparison with charcoal syntheses from various regions confirmed that the Lev transport to the profile site is sourced from the fire activities in the boreal NH, especially in northern Europe and northern Siberia. The Lev flux exhibited a slight overall decreasing trend at -3 %/kyr (p = 0.09) over the study period, as well as centennial maxima at -9, 8-7, 6, 5, and 4-3 kyr BP (p = 0.06). On sub-orbital scales, the long-term decrease in fire activities corresponded to trends of summer temperature in the extratropics of the NH (p = 0.01, r = 0.42), reflecting their regulation of fuel availability and flammability. On centennial to sub-millennial time scales, high levels of biomass burning were associated with periods of increased North Atlantic ice-rafted debris (p = 0.02, r = 0.38), which were indicative of cold and dry conditions over most of the source regions, reflecting the impacts of dryness on fuel flammability. The results suggested that enhanced Arctic amplification on centennial time scales may reduce biomass burning in most of the boreal NH, although fires in some mid-latitude regions may be facilitated.					xie, zhouqing/P-9661-2019	Xie, Zhouqing/0000-0003-1703-5157													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 1	2023	867								161460	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161460		JAN 2023						36626988					WOS:000999093900001

The results showed that the algal shift process was affected by the initial biomass of the colonial Microcystis, and the algal community diversified. When the Microcystis bulk concentration was between 2.0 and 16.0 mL L-1, the bloom became dominated by diatom Nitzschia palea, which aggregated on the mucilage sheathes of the Microcystis colonies. The diatom density at bulk concentration biomass of 2.0 mL L-1 reached a maximum at 2.8 x 105 cells mL-1 on day 27. When the bulk concentration was at 18.0-24.0 mL L-1, no diatom dominance appeared. The shift from a Microcystis bloom to diatom dominance was affected by the initial Microcystis biomass, and the most suitable bulk concentration biomass for colonial Microcystis was at 2-12 mL L-1, in which the chlorophyll-a level was about from 285 to 1714 mu g L-1. The mechanism underlying this algal shift may be that the low light and nutrient levels in the Microcystis bloom promoted diatom aggregation growth on the mucilage sheaths of Microcystis colonies under continuous aeration mixing.					; Li, Yiming/NHP-3478-2025	wang, xiao dong/0000-0001-7476-0801; 														1424-2818				NOV	2024	16	11							695	10.3390/d16110695	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d16110695													WOS:001364354800001

The aim was to understand: (i) what sources can influence the lake water geochemistry; (ii) what is the role of lake stratification on water chemistry; (iii) how the lake water chemistry evolves during flooding. To answer these questions, T degrees, conductivity, pH and Eh depth profiles were measured with a specific probe (Seabird((R))) in the lakes (seven surveys between July 1998 and February 2002). At the same time, water samples were collected every 5 m along the profiles and were analysed for Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, SO42-, NO3-, F-, Cl-, HCO3-, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, Co, Cd and Mn. The geological and hydrogeological contexts play a major role on the water chemistry of the lakes and three sources of influence have been distinguished : (i) the contribution of underlying mine groundwater, enriched in SO42-, due to the leaching of sulfide oxidation products from old flooded underground works; (ii) the seepage through coal mine spoils also containing sulfides; (iii) to a lesser extent Triassic formations, containing gypsum, present in the Fouthiaux area, which lead to a SO42- enrichment of lake waters. All these influences result in an enrichment in SO42-, showing essentially a neutralised acid mine drainage process, that is characterised by neutral to slightly alkaline waters, and an absence of high metal contents (except for Fe and Mn) which are non soluble at the pH and Eh conditions present in the lakes. The two studied lakes were initially meromictic and ions such as SO42- or Mn can show high concentrations at depth, in the lake layers which are not subject to winter mixing. During the studied period, Lake St. Louis remained meromictic and non removed elements continue to have high concentrations in deep zones. In contrast, Lake Fouthiaux, initially meromictic, became holomictic with time and the bottom layer did not maintain the enrichment in SO42-, Mn, and other elements shown at the beginning.

Breeding persistence of Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus) at long-term monitoring sites: predictors of a steep decline at the northern European range limit	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												The Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus) has its European northern range limit in northern Norway, and is a species of national conservation concern due to its small population size and unknown population trend. Long-term monitoring at the range limit suggests breeding site use is in decline. We used annual occupancy data from 104 breeding lakes monitored since 1991 in northern Norway to investigate correlates of change in occupancy. Persistence was 100 % until 1999, but thereafter decreased to 25 % (26 lakes with breeding pairs). A particularly steep decrease occurred between 2010 and 2012. Persistence increased with the number of pairs present in each lake in the initial monitoring year of 1991. The number of grebe pairs also decreased in the lakes that had continuous breeding persistence over the entire 22-year monitoring period, suggesting that a large-scale factor caused the population decline. Over the last year of the monitoring series, lake altitude was negatively related to the probability of persistence, indicative that locally harsh climate played some role in breeding distribution. The temporal pattern of persistence was not related to mean winter temperature at the breeding sites; however, the decrease between 2010 and 2011 coincided with a late ice melt in 2010. Monitoring that includes a larger area of the species' range is required to conclude whether the observed decline can indicate an overall decline in population size, or range fluctuations at the edge of the species' range. However, investigating the processes that determine population range borders can give insights into important limiting factors pertinent to the conservation of species in the long term.																			0021-8375	1439-0361				JAN	2016	157	1					75	84		10.1007/s10336-015-1249-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-015-1249-7													WOS:000368610900008
J	Münzner, K; Lindström, ES; Rohrlack, T				Munzner, Karla; Lindstroem, Eva S.; Rohrlack, Thomas			Nuisance alga reduces lake partial pressure of carbon dioxide and carbon flux to the atmosphere in boreal lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Boreal lakes are generally seen as sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, even though a part of them are periodically undersaturated with CO2 and have the potential to be net-autotrophic. This undersaturation is the result of photosynthetic activity by phytoplankton, especially flagellated species like Gonyostomum semen, which form high-biomass blooms in brown water lakes. We hypothesized that CO2 reduction by G. semen is common across boreal lakes, and that those reductions vary with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations across lakes. In our field study, we explored how G. semen abundance affected the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the water column and the estimated carbon flux to the atmosphere in four lakes in Sweden and Norway in summer 2021. We found that lake pCO2 and carbon flux to the atmosphere decreased with increasing G. semen abundances, though all lakes still emitted CO2 to the atmosphere. High DOC concentrations acted as a limiting factor for G. semen growth, indicating that G. semen's potential to reduce pCO2 and carbon flux to the atmosphere weakens with increasing DOC concentrations. Still, G. semen's impact on pCO2 and carbon flux to the atmosphere is relevant in a wider spatial context, because G. semen and other motile flagellated species are expected to increase in range and bloom frequency in boreal lakes. Thus, we propose that CO2 fixation via photosynthesis is an underestimated factor in controlling CO2 dynamics in boreal lakes, and that it should be included in large-scale CO2 budget calculations.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				AUG	2025	70	8					2192	2207		10.1002/lno.70081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.70081		JUN 2025											WOS:001513074000001

However, the dissolution of magnetic minerals can significantly alter detrital magnetic mineral assemblages, thereby complicating their interpretation in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In an effort to clarify the impact of this dissolution on the grain size of magnetic minerals in lacustrine sediments, we undertook a thorough analysis of the rock magnetic properties on samples from the interval characterized by low ARM (anhysteretic remanent magnetization)/SIRM (saturation isothermal remanent magnetization) values between 140 and 320 ka in the Heqing (HQ) lacustrine drill core, located in Southwest China. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and FORC diagrams revealed a predominance of single-vortex and pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite and maghemite within the sample. When compared to samples from both the glacial and interglacial periods, the high SIRM, elevated magnetic susceptibility, and low ARM/SIRM ratio intervals from 140 to 320 ka suggested a high concentration of magnetic minerals coupled with a relatively low concentration of fine-grained particles in the sediments. The reductive dissolution of the fine-grained magnetic oxides is responsible for the reduction in the fine-grained magnetic particles in this interval. Our findings indicate that pedogenic fine-grained magnetite and maghemite are the first to dissolve, followed by the dissolution of coarser-grained iron oxides into finer particles. This process underscores the complex interplay between magnetic mineral dissolution and grain size distribution in lacustrine sediments, with significant implications for the reliability of paleoenvironmental interpretations derived from magnetic parameters.					; xu, xinwen/OEN-8727-2025; yang, ziyi/JGD-5349-2023	Yang, Ziyi/0009-0006-5472-716X; xu, xinwen/0000-0003-4826-8703; 														2075-163X				NOV	2024	14	11							1096	10.3390/min14111096	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min14111096													WOS:001365545200001

The research covers the period from 2015 to 2022. The study uses remote sensing satellite images obtained from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, as a result of processing in the SNAP application. At the same time, in situ researches was performed. Aims: This study aims to research chlorophyll concentration in Paliastom lake and its adjacent area through remote sensing methods and in situ data. Methods: For our research and historical data collection, satellite remote sensing was applied, which generates data on spatial and temporal variations of suspended particles in estuaries and coastlines. In situ studies, Chlorophyll concentration and promoting chemical agents were measured, water temperature, pH, total hardness, alkalinity, acidity, and others. Total turbidity was determined, and qualitative reactions were performed to define the presence of phosphates and nitrates. Results: The results received through remote sensing, and in situ studies were compared. Paliastom lake and its adjacent area are prone to eutrophication processes. Natural phenomena and human industrial activity cause the process. Discussion: According to in situ studies and the data obtained from sensors, the water in Paliastom lake is prone to a weak alkaline reaction. The water of the lake can be considered as having medium turbidity. Phosphate and nitrate ion detection reactions performed with qualitative analysis protocols showed positive samples. The intensity of the obtained color indicated their high concentration. Conclusions: The annual evolution of Chl-a in Paliastom lake reaches the maximum value in the summer months. Compared to previous years, a decrease in chlorophyll concentration was observed during the lockdown period of 2020 due to the Covid Pandemic.

The Nature and Origin of Decadal to Millennial Scale Climate Variability in the Southern Tropics of South America: The Holocene Record of Lago Umayo, Peru	PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN SOUTH AMERICA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS: FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM TO THE HOLOCENE	Developments in Paleoenvironmental Research											This paper serves two purposes: to review current ideas about the nature and forcing of decadal to millennial scale precipitation variation in the southern tropics of South America during the late Quaternary and to present a new methodology for the reconstruction of precipitation as applied to a Holocene stable isotopic record of carbonate sediments in a tropical Andean lake, Lago Umayo, Peru. The basic thesis of the first part of the paper is that, although modern instrumental records suffice for deducing climate variability at decadal and shorter time scales, these records cannot adequately characterize the nature and forcing of lower-frequency climate variation. Understanding the nature of multi-decadal to millennial-scale climate variation and the mechanisms of large abrupt climate change is best derived from paleoclimatic time series. Tropical Atlantic sea-surface temperature variation is a significant control on tropical South American paleoclimate at these longer time scales. In the second part of the paper, an original method is presented for quantitatively reconstructing precipitation. This method utilizes the well-known relationship between the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and the amount of precipitation, a relationship that is highly significant in many tropical locales. Due to many simplifying assumptions, the reconstruction should be considered to be tentative. A similar to 12% increase in precipitation (similar to 570 to 650 mm a(-1)) at 4750 cal year BP is consistent with the 6% increase in summer insolation at this latitude over the same period. However, the increase in precipitation was neither unidirectional nor gradual. Instead, every 240 years on average, precipitation increased or decreased by at least similar to 8% for periods lasting on average 100 years. The largest of these events had similar to 15% positive or negative departures from the long-term mean precipitation. These southern tropical wet events apparently coincided with periods of low sea-surface temperatures in the high-latitude North Atlantic, supporting a hypothesis of a tropical North Atlantic sea-surface temperature control on tropical South American precipitation at decadal to millennial scales.

J	HEIKKINEN, K				HEIKKINEN, K			NATURE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN THE DRAINAGE-BASIN OF A BOREAL HUMIC RIVER IN NORTHERN FINLAND	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The nature of dissolved organic matter in river, brook, and peat mining water in the drainage basin of the humic Kiiminkijoki River, located in an area of minerotrophic peatlands in northern Finland in the boreal region, was studied by gel filtration. Special emphasis was paid to changes in the nature of high molecular weight organic Fe-P colloids that result from peat mining. The river water is organically colored, with high organic matter and Fe concentrations. High apparent molecular weight (HAMW) organic colloids are important for the transport of Fe and P in the basin. The gel filtration data suggest that the DOM in the water consist mainly of fulvic acids (FA), although humic acids (HA) are also important. The proportion of dissolved organic C (DOC) and Fe in the HAMV organic colloids increases in increasing DOC and iron concentrations in the river water. The apparent molecular weight of the DOM is higher than in the lakes in the area of ombrotrophic peatlands in southern Finland. Color in this humic water increases with DOC and Fe concentrations. The effect of Fe on color values can be seen in filtered (< 1.2 .mu.m) river water and in all the gel filtration fractions. The results indicate an increase in the mobilization of HAMW organic Fe-P colloids in the peatlands of the area following drainage and peat mining. The average ratio of Fe to DOC in the HAMW organic fraction is higher in the peat mining water than in the Keihasoja brook in a natural peaty area. It is possible that the Fe to DOC ratio in these colloids transported in the river increases following drainage and peat mining, especially under low flow conditions in summer. This may lead to gradual changes in the detritus food webs of the river ecosystem.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				OCT-DEC	1990	19	4					649	657		10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900040004x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900040004x													WOS:A1990EK01900004

In situ, the mat surface can reach high temperatures (ca. 50 degrees C in summer), and experiences daily temperature fluctuations due to tidal inundation. A mat sample was incubated in the laboratory at 25, 35, 45, 50 and 60 degrees C. Areal rates of gross and net photosynthesis increased with increasing temperature, and maximum rates were detected at 45 degrees C. The photosynthetic zone (i.e. the depth zone in which oxygenic photosynthesis was detectable by the light-dark shift method) decreased from 3 to 1.75 mm with increasing temperature. Above 50 degrees C, photosynthesis was completely inhibited, probably due to high sulfide concentrations. This inhibition was confirmed by the pH profiles, where the peak in the top 2 to 4 mm at 25 to 45 degrees C disappeared at 50 to 60 degrees C. Between 25 and 45 degrees C, areal oxygen consumption rates in the light did not change significantly but showed a decreasing trend in the photosynthetic zone, suggesting a decoupling between photosynthesis and oxygen consumption in the light. In both the light and dark, sulfide production was strongly enhanced by increasing temperature to a maximum flux at 50 degrees C, above which it became inhibited. At 50 to 60 degrees C, the sulfide produced could not be completely removed by sulfide oxidation, resulting in sulfide leakage to the overlying water. Our data demonstrate that these mat ecosystems are well adapted to high ambient temperatures. Photosynthesis, oxygen consumption in the light and sulfide production are differentially controlled by temperature. However, the individual processes in this complex community are not only directly controlled by temperature, but also by the temperature-dependent response of other processes.					de Beer, Dirk/L-4840-2013; Polerecky, Lubos/E-1134-2014; Abed, Raeid/D-1086-2013; Al-Najjar, Mohammad/AAB-1377-2019	de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781; Polerecky, Lubos/0000-0003-4425-585X; Al-Najjar, Mohammad A.

However, the varying vegetation succession patterns and responses to large-scale climate events during this period have sparked debate. Here, we present a well-dated, continuous pollen record from Erhai (EH) lake on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, to discuss biome variation and its relative forcings over the past 17.2 kyr. Our results indicate that evergreen sclerophyll Quercus forests (ESQF) were predominant surrounding the EH site during the early deglaciation (17.2-12.5 cal ka BP), and that the ESQF transitioned to deciduous broadleaved forest (DBLF) and Tsuga forest (TSUF) around 12.5 cal ka BP during the YD event. During the early to midHolocene, the mountain vegetation belts surrounding EH lake were likely similar to the original vegetation present in modern times. Since approximately 2 cal ka BP, a significant increase in anthropochorous taxa proportions has been recorded, largely attributed to early human activities and fire disturbances. Although the warming and wetting trends did not exceed the optimal growth range for Quercus (ES) during the last deglaciation, allowing ESQF to continue growing extensively on sunny mountain slopes, our findings clearly disclosed the regional disparities in vegetation responses to climate change across SW China. Moreover, millennial-scale glacier fluctuations on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, influenced by monsoon precipitation, likely played a role in driving vegetation succession in the mountains surrounding the EH lake and other areas of the Hengduan region since the deglaciation.

Evidence for non-indigenous freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii spreading in Finland	MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS												Cnidarians are among the most successful aquatic invaders, and the freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbii is a prime example from non-marine systems. The hydrozoan has spread through northern temperate latitudes worldwide, and in the 1990s, the first records from Finland marked its northernmost distribution in Europe. Since then, no systematic monitoring of C. sowerbii's distribution and genetic identity has been made. We compiled and analysed occurrence data that had mainly accumulated through community science websites to the FinBIF data warehouse. By 2024, over 65 reports of freshwater jellyfish from 19 locations across southern Finland were received. Numerically, most reports were from a few artificial swimming ponds in the vicinity of population centres, whereas most locations were shallow lakes or bays scattered through rural southern Finland. The number of reports has sharply increased in recent years, along with overall increases in community science observations and an upward trend in average surface water temperature of lakes and coastal sea. Most of the observations were from late summer (mid-July to September). The northernmost record (in 2020) was from 62.82 degrees N, 250 km north of the initial public record in 1999. We also assessed the phylogeographic relationship of Finnish samples from the COI gene. The global mitochondrial C. sowerbii diversity comprises three deep lineages all distributed on multiple continents. The Finnish specimens represent a branch within the most widespread lineage, with a sequence identical or nearly identical to ones from Czechia, Greece, Singapore, and China. As spreading is predicted to continue with global warming, monitoring efforts in freshwater systems are advised.

J	Bacon, JR; Hewitt, IJ; Cooper, P				Bacon, JR; Hewitt, IJ; Cooper, P			Origin of lead associated with different reactive phases in Scottish upland soils: an assessment made using sequential extraction and isotope analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Soil samples (0 - 25 cm) have been taken annually since 1991 from three protected plots set up at an upland location at Glensaugh in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The soils were analysed using the original BCR sequential extraction procedure and the lead isotopic composition was determined in each of the fractions, as well as the unfractionated soil using thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). The lead concentrations in all the soils, including those well away from the road, were much higher than typical background values indicating that the whole area has been subject to deposition of anthropogenic lead. The distribution of lead between the different fractions was similar for the two non-roadside soils with most lead present in the oxidizable fraction. Although most lead in the roadside soil was also present in the oxidizable fraction, a substantial proportion ( about 10%) was in the easily soluble fraction suggesting that roadside lead could be more mobile than lead in the other soils. Good reproducibility was obtained for the isotope analyses in all the fractions. The ratios calculated for the bulk soil from the ratios in the individual fractions agreed very closely with those measured directly in the unfractionated soil thereby demonstrating both reproducibilty and accuracy. The lowest Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios were found in the roadside soil consistent with the recent deposition of petrol lead. The Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in all fractions of the other soils fell into a narrow band and it was necessary to use Pb-204 ratios to differentiate between lead in the extractable fractions and lead in the residual component. It is probable that lead in the non-roadside soils was deposited a considerable time ago and is characterised by a relatively high Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio. Use of the Pb-204 ratios showed that the residual components in each of the three soils were isotopically distinct.																			1464-0325						2004	6	9					766	773		10.1039/b405364h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b405364h								15346181					WOS:000223659700007
J	Shang, XF; Duan, TZ; Hou, JG; Li, Y				Shang Xiaofei; Duan Taizhong; Hou Jiagen; Li Yan			Spatial configuration of sand and mud in the lacustrine nearshore sand bar deposits and its geological implications	PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT												Different configurational orders of sand bodies and interlayers in lacustrine nearshore sand bar reservoirs frequently interact, causing complicated genesis and distribution of argillaceous sediments, as well as other issues. This paper investigates the spatial configuration of sand and mud in the sand bar reservoir, and analyzes its internal structure. Modern sand bar deposits in the Xiashan Lake, Shandong Province, China, were analyzed and compared with the sand bar reservoirs of the Member 2 of the Paleogene Shahejie Formation in the Banqiao Sag, China. The configurational mode of sand bar deposits was explored from the perspective of the spatial distribution and composition relationships between sand and mud. Based on the alternate deposition characteristics of sand and mud in the longitudinal direction, lacustrine nearshore sand bars can be divided into three sedimentary combination patterns: thin-sand and thin-mud interbed pattern, thick-mud thick-sand pattern, and thin-mud thick-sand pattern. Their mud components manifest as the deposition of fine-grained lithofacies of multiple genetic types. These include (semi-)deep lacustrine mud, sand and mud interbedded beach, argillaceous sediments in the water retention area behind the bar, and fall-silt seams that resulted from flood discharge. By summarizing the specific developmental locations and sequential relationships of each fine-grained argillaceous facies in modern sand bar deposits, a depositional process-based argillaceous sediment composition model is proposed. Based on this, this paper discusses the spatial configuration of sand bodies and argillaceous sediments in sand bar reservoirs, and introduces the typical stratigraphic structures of sand bars in two environments, i.e., vertical superposition and lateral migration. In lacustrine nearshore sand bar reservoirs, the deposition and preservation degrees of mud mainly depend on three factors: accommodation space change, frequency of base-level cycles, and exposure-erosion time. These in turn influence the continuity and relative contents of sand and mud in reservoirs. The distribution of argillaceous sediments forms different orders of interlayers, which affects the heterogeneity and fluid percolation of sand bar reservoirs. Clarifying the space-matching relationship of sand and mud in sand bar deposits provides geological models and information parameters for the refined characterization and modeling of the internal configuration of sand bar reservoirs. Furthermore, this work offers guidance for the optimal adjustment of reservoir development strategies or the optimization of reservoir development plans.																			1000-0747					OCT	2019	46	5					954	968		10.1016/S1876-3804(19)60252-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1876-3804(19)60252-1													WOS:000490742600009

During the Medeco2 cruise in fall 2007, ROV dives enabled detailed sampling of the brine fluid, bottom lake sediments at ca. 450 m lake depth, sub-surface sediments from the MV flanks, and carbonate crusts at the MV foot. Based on mineralogical, elemental and stable isotope analyses, this study aims at exploring the origin of the brine fluid and the key biogeochemical processes controlling the formation of these deep-sea authigenic carbonates. In addition to their patchy occurrence in crusts outcropping at the seafloor, authigenic carbonates occur as small concretions disseminated within sub-seafloor sediments, as well as in the bottom sediments and muddy brine of the crater lake. Aragonite and Mg-calcite dominate in the carbonate crusts and in sub-seafloor concretions at the MV foot, whereas Mg-calcite, dolomite and ankerite dominate in the muddy brine lake and in sub-seafloor concretions near the crater rim. The carbonate crusts and sub-seafloor concretions at the MV foot precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with bottom seawater temperature; their low delta C-13 values (-42.6 to -24.5aEuro degrees) indicate that anaerobic oxidation of methane was the main driver of carbonate precipitation. By contrast, carbonates from the muddy lake brine, bottom lake concretions and crater rim concretions display much higher delta C-13 (up to -5.2aEuro degrees) and low delta O-18 values (down to -2.8aEuro degrees); this is consistent with their formation in warm fluids of deep origin characterized by C-13-rich CO2 and, as confirmed by independent evidence, slightly higher heavy rare earth element signatures, the main driver of carbonate precipitation being methanogenesis. Moreover, the benthic activity within the seafloor sediment enhances aerobic oxidation of methane and of sulphide that promotes carbonate dissolution and gypsum precipitation. These findings imply that the coupling of carbon and sulphur microbial reactions represents the major link for the transfer of elements and for carbon isotope fractionation between fluids and authigenic minerals. A new challenge awaiting future studies in cold seep environments is to expand this work to oxidized and reduced sulphur authigenic minerals.

We assessed the impact of operating a tidal power plant, established for restoration of the polluted Lake Shihwa, South Korea, on the marine environment and benthic communities. Prior to the plant's implementation, the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates in Lake Shihwa was below 10 species per 0.1 m2, and the ecosystem was characterized by instability and high variability. However, post-implementation, stable communities with increased species richness, abundance, and biomass developed. These communities changed to resemble those of the outer sea by 2012, indicating rapid recovery. A significant increase in salinity was observed in Lake Shihwa, and recurring summer hypoxia events were eliminated. Also, chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels and sediment organic carbon contents were markedly reduced. Although no deterioration in water quality was observed in the outer sea, the benthic communities at the study sites closest to the tidal power plant experienced initial degradation and recoveries immediately after the plant began operating. Our findings show that restoring seawater circulation was vital for this ecosystem's recovery. However, since 2017, COD levels in both Lake Shihwa and the outer sea have been rising. In 2022, a significant increase in the community indices of benthic communities in Lake Shihwa was noted, and high densities of Arcuatula senhousia in Lake Shihwa suggest the effects of organic matter accumulation. These results underscore the importance of long-term monitoring and active restoration programs, including ongoing coastal conservation and management.

Ostracod associations (living and empty valves) in sixty-six sediment samples collected from diverse aquatic habitats (lakes, estuary-like water and lagoon-like water waters, rivers, ponds and springs) were quantitatively assessed. Eleven Recent Ostracoda were found (nine living and two as empty valves only). Cluster analysis established two significant (p < 0.05) habitat specific associations; (i) Leucocytherella sinensis, Limnocythere inopinata, Leucocythere? dorsotuberosa, Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis and Candona xizangensis are lacustrine fauna, (ii) Tonnacypris gyirongensis, Candona candida, Ilyocypris sp., Heterocypris incongruens and Heterocypris salina are temporary water species. Ostracod distribution and abundance are significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to physico-chemical variables. The first two axes of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explain 30.9% of the variation in the species abundance data. Conductivity and habitat types are the most influential ecological factors explaining the presence and abundance of ostracods. Spearman correlation analysis reveals that: (i) Two species, L.? dorsotuberosa (r = 0.25) and L. inopinata (r = 0.36) have a significant positive correlation with conductivity while one species, T. gyirongensis (r =-0.68) displays a significant negative correlation with conductivity. Limnocythere inopinata correlates significantly positive (r = 0.37) with alkalinity. Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis correlates significantly positive (r =0.28) with water depth. Key indicator living assemblages ate: (i) L. sinensis dominates Ca-depleted brackish waters although ubiquitously distributed; (ii) L? dorsotuberosa dwells in fresh to brackish waters; (iii) L. inopinata predominates in mesohaline to polyhaline waters; (iv) F. gyirongensis inhabits exclusively brackish-lacustrine deeper waters; (v) C. candida populates freshwaters; (vi) T. gyirongensis and Ilyocypris sp. are restricted to shallow temporary waters; (vii) H. incongruens occurs in ponds. Water depth indicators are F. gyirongensis and L? dorsotuberosa, useful in ostracod assemblages for palaeo-water depth reconstruction. Our results expand the knowledge of the ecological significance of Recent Tibetan Ostracoda ecology. This is a new insight on habitat chacteristics of both living assemblages and sub-Recent associations of ostracods in mountain aquatic ecosystems. The new modern ostracod dataset can be used for the quantitative reconstruction of past environmental variables (e.g., conductivity) and types of water environment. The key indicator ostracods are relevant in palaeolimnological and climate research on the Tibetan Plateau.

A suite of water samples was collected from the summit of the volcano to a point roughly 40 kin downstream where the pH of the Rio Agrio rose above 6.0, This suite included a sample of the hyperacidic (pH < 1) crater lake at the summit of Copahue, the hot-spring source of the Upper Rio Agrio (pH < 2), two depth profiles through Lake Caviahue (a large glacially-carved lake with pH similar to 2.6, located 10 km east of the volcano summit), and several samples of the Lower Rio Agrio downstream of Lake Caviahue where pH increased due to the influx of tributary streams. Both filtered and non-filtered samples were collected and analyzed for major ions, trace metals, and rare earth elements (REE). The concentrations of REE in the Rio Agrio decreased by several orders of magnitude through the study area, as a result of dilution and chemical attenuation. A subtle shift in the slope of shale-normalized profiles of dissolved REE concentration was observed, from being weakly positive near the source of the Rio Agrio, to showing a weak middle REE enrichment trend in Lake Caviahue. to being weakly negative in the lower reaches of the river. The trend to a negative slope across the lanthanide series in the lower river is explained by selective partitioning of the heavier REE to hydrous oxides of Fe and Al suspended in the water column, and accumulating on the riverbed. Most of the decrease in REE load occurred immediately downstream of the confluence with a tributary that increased the pH of the Rio Agrio from 4.3 to 6.1. Although the mixed water was supersaturated with REE phosphate compounds, precipitation of LnPO(4) is not believed to have been a dominant process because the predicted pattern of inter-element fractionation from phosphate deposition is inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, REE attenuation most likely occurred from adsorption onto freshly precipitated hydrous aluminum oxide. The behavior of REE in the Rio Agrio watershed is broadly similar to what has been observed in watersheds that owe their acidity to oxidation of sulfide minerals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Although environmental information has been recorded for most of the world's lakes, some vegetation and climate history inconsistencies have persisted since the Holocene due to large regional differences. In this study, sediment samples were collected from Chahanur Lake on the Inner Mongolia Plateau, the dating sequence of the samples was determined by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14 C dating, and the vegetation history was reconstructed using the biome method and the climate was reconstructed using the weighted averaging partial least squares (WAPLS) method. Vegetation and climate history were systematically analysed. The results showed that the profile age of the lake was 11438-7918 cal. yr BP. During the early Holocene, vegetation evolved from sparse forest steppe (11438-10092 cal. yr BP) to broad-leaved forest steppe (10092-9288 cal. yr BP), and finally to the sparse forest steppe (9288-7918 cal. yr BP). Climate changed from cold and dry during 11438-10092 cal. yr BP, to warm and wet between 10092 and 9288 cal. yr BP, then warm and dry from 9288 to 7918 cal. yr BP. The reconstruction of palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate indicates increased precipitation during the early Holocene on the Inner Mongolia Plateau. This supports previous studies on palaeovegetation and enriches the Holocene pollen database. (c) 2025 Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

Long-term Dynamics of Pike Infection by Parasites Triaenophorus crassus and T. nodulosus (Plathelminthes, Cestoda) in the Rybinsk Reservoir: Effect of Hydraulic Construction and Climate Warming	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The long-term dynamics (over more than 70 years) of pike infection by cestodes Triaenophorus crassus and T. nodulosus in the Rybinsk Reservoir (the Volga River) has been studied in a comparative aspect. Cestode T. crassus is an invasive species that has entered the reservoir together with vendace Coregonus albula (the second intermediate host) from Lake Beloe; T. nodulosus is a native species that develops with the involvement of perch as a second intermediate host. Climate warming in the Rybinsk Reservoir manifests itself in a consistently growing average water temperature. This has led to a gradual decrease in the rate of pike infection by cestode T. crassus as a result of disturbances in the set of complex ecological relationships between the parasite and its hosts: a decrease in the abundance of large pike, fluctuations in the reservoir water level, and mass death of vendace in years with abnormally hot summers and the alternation of strong and weak year-classes in this short-cycle species (age 1+ to 3+). The long-term dynamics of pike infection by T. nodulosus is characterized by its consistently high rates and slight fluctuations. The abundance of perch population in the Rybinsk Reservoir remains high, and its age composition is stable, which contributes to a high rate of infection of both perch and pike by T. nodulosus. Cestode T. crassus occurs only in large pike (30 cm long or more); the rate of infection increases with age; T. nodulosus parasitizes mainly young pike (starting from young of the year), with the infection rate decreasing in large pike.

J	Cordell, D; Unsworth, MJ; Díaz, D				Cordell, Darcy; Unsworth, Martyn J.; Diaz, Daniel			Imaging the Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field, central Chile using magnetotellurics: Evidence for crustal melt regions laterally-offset from surface vents and lava flows	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Magnetotelluric (MT) data were collected at the Laguna del Maule volcanic field (LdMVF), located in central Chile (36 degrees S, 70.5 degrees W), which has been experiencing unprecedented upward ground deformation since 2007. These data were used to create the first detailed three-dimensional electrical resistivity model of the LdMVF and surrounding area. The resulting model was spatially complex with several major conductive features imaged at different depths and locations around Laguna del Maule (LdM). A near-surface conductor (Cl; 0.5 Omega m) approximately 100 m beneath the lake is interpreted as a conductive smectite clay cap related to a shallow hydrothermal reservoir. At 4 km depth, a strong conductor (C3; 0.3 Omega m) is located beneath the western edge of LdM. The proximity of C3 to the recent Pleistocene-to-Holocene vents in the northwest LdMVF and nearby hot springs suggests that C3 is a hydrous (>5 wt% H2O), rhyolitic partial melt with melt fraction >35% and a free-water hydrothermal component. C3 dips towards, and is connected to, a deeper conductor (C4; 1 Omega m). C4 is located to the north of LdM at >8 km depth below surface and is interpreted as a long-lived, rhyolitic-to-andesitic magma reservoir with melt fractions less than 35%. It is hypothesized that the deeper magma reservoir (C4) is providing melt and hydrothermal fluids to the shallower magma reservoir (C3). A large conductor directly beneath the LdMVF is not imaged with MT suggesting that any mush volume beneath LdM must be anhydrous (<2 wt% H2O), low temperature and low melt fraction (<25%) in order to go undetected. The presence of large conductors to the north has important implications for magma dynamics as it suggests that material may have a significant lateral component (>10 km) as it moves from the deep magma reservoir (C4) to create small, ephemeral volumes of eruptible melt (C3). It is hypothesized that there may be a north-south contrast in physical processes affecting the growth of melt-rich zones since major conductors are imaged in the northern LdMVF while no major conductors are detected beneath the southern vents. The analysis and interpretation of features directly beneath the lake is complicated by the surface conductor C1 which attenuates low-frequency signals. The attenuation from Cl does not affect C3 or C4. At 1 km depth directly beneath LdM, a weak conductor (C2; <10 Omega m) is imaged but is not required by the data. Forward modeling tests show that a relatively large (30 km 3 ), high melt fraction (>50%), silicic reservoir with 5 wt% H2O at 2 to 5 km depth beneath the inflation center is not supported by the MT data. However, a smaller (10 km(3) ) eruptible volume could go undetected even with relatively high melt fraction (>50%). The location of large melt regions to the north has important implications for long-term volcanic hazards at LdMVF as well as other volcanoes as it raises the possibility that the vent distribution is not always indicative of the location of deeper source regions of melt.

The mufti-proxy record suggests that in the Oldest Dryas, the landscape around Lake Bled was rather open, presumably because of the cold and dry climate, with a trend towards wetter conditions, as suggested by an increase in tree pollen as well as chironomid and cladocera faunas typical for well-oxygenated water. Climatic warming at the beginning of the Late-glacial Interstadial at ca. 14,800 cal yr BP is suggested by an increase in the delta O-18 value, the appearance of Betula and Larix pollen and macrofossils, and a warmth-adapted chironomid fauna. With further warming at ca. 13,800 cal yr BP, broad-leaved tree taxa (Quercus, Tilia, Minus), Artemisia, and Picea increase, whereas chironomid data (Cricotopus B) suggest lowering of lake levels. After 12,800 cal yr BP (and throughout the Younger Dryas), the climate was colder and drier, as indicated by lower delta O-18 values, decline of trees, increase of microscopic charcoal, xerophytes and littoral chironomids. A warmer climate, together with the spread of broad-leaved tree taxi and a deeper, more productive lake, mark the onset of the Lateglacial/Holocene transition. These results suggest that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at Lake Bled were very dynamic and sensitive to Late-glacial climatic fluctuations.

The late-glacial climate signal from the southern Chilean Lake District ties into that from proglacial Lago Mascardi in the nearby Argentine Andes, which shows rapid ice recession peaking at 12,400 14C yr sp, followed by a reversal of trend that culminated in Younger-Dryas-age glacier readvance at 11,400-10200 (14)C yr BP. Many full- and late-glacial climate shifts in the southern Lake District match those from New Zealand at nearly the same Southern Hemisphere middle latitudes. At the last glacial maximum (LGM), snowline lowering relative to present-day values was nearly the same in the Southern Alps (875 m) and the Chilean Andes (1000 m). Particularly noteworthy are the new Younger-Dryas-age exposure dates of the Lake Misery moraines in Arthur's Pass in the Southern Alps. Moreover, pollen records from the Waikato lowlands on North Island show that a major vegetation shift at close to 14;100 (14)C yr BP marked the beginning of the Last glacial/interglacial transition (Newnham et al. 1989). The synchronous and nearly uniform lowering of snowlines in Southern Hemisphere middle-latitude mountains compared with Northern Hemisphere values suggests global cooling of about the same magnitude in both hemispheres at the LGM. When compared with paleoclimate records from the North Atlantic region, the middle-latitude Southern Hemisphere terrestrial data imply interhemispheric symmetry of the structure and timing of the last glacial/interglacial transition. In both regions atmospheric warming pulses are implicated near the beginning of Oldest Dryas time (similar to 14,600 (14)C yr BP) and near the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition (similar to 12,700-13,000 (14)C yr BP). The second of these warming pulses was coincident with resumption of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation similar to that of the modem mode, with strong formation of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water in the Nordic Seas. In both regions, the maximum Bolling-age warmth was achieved at 12,200-12,500 (14)C yr sp, and was followed by a reversal in climate trend. In the North Atlantic region, and possibly in middle latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere,this reversal culminated in a Younger-Dryas-age cold pulse. Although changes in ocean circulation can redistribute heat between the hemispheres, they cannot alone account either for the synchronous planetary cooling of the LGM or for the synchronous interhemispheric warming steps of the abrupt glacial-to-interglacial transition. Instead, the dominant interhemispheric climate linkage must feature a global atmospheric signal. The most likely source of this signal is a change in the greenhouse content of the atmosphere. We speculate that the Oldest Dryas warming pulse originated from an increase in atmospheric water-vapor production by half-precession forcing in the tropics. The major thermohaline switch near the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition then could have triggered another increase in tropical water-vapor production to near-interglacial values.					; Moreno, Patricio/D-2317-2012	Lowell, Thomas/0000-0001-7826-0636; Moreno, Patricio/0000-0002-1333-6238													0435-3676						1999	81A	2					107	153		10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00055.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.1999.00055.x													WOS:000081554200002

Chlorine isotope and Cl-Br fractionation in fluids of Pods volcano (Costa Rica): Insight into an active volcanic-hydrothermal system	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Halogen-rich volcanic fluids issued at the surface carry information on properties and processes operating in shallow hydrothermal systems. This paper reports a long-term record of Cl-Br concentrations and delta Cl-37 signatures of lake water and fumaroles from the active crater of Fogs volcano (Costa Rica), where surface expressions of magmatic-hydrothermal activity have shown substantial periodic changes over the last decades. Both the hyperacid water of its crater lake (Laguna Caliente) and subaerial fumaroles show significant temporal variability in Cl-Br concentrations, Br/Cl ratios and delta Cl-37, reflecting variations in the mode and magnitude of volatile transfer. The delta Cl-37 signatures of the lake, covering the period 1985-2012, show fluctuations between +0.02 +/- 0.06 parts per thousand and +1.15 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand. Condensate samples from adjacent fumaroles on the southern shore, collected during the interval (20102012) with strong changes in gas temperature (107-763 degrees C), display a much larger range from -0.43 +/- 0.09 parts per thousand to +14.09 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand. Most of the variations in Cl isotope, Br/Cl and concentration signals can be attributed to interaction between magma-derived gas and liquid water in the volcanic-hydrothermal system below the crater. The delta Cl-37 were lowest and closest to magmatic values in (1) fumarolic gas that experienced little or no interaction with subsurface water and followed a relatively dry pathway, and (2) water that captured the bulk of magmatic halogen output so that no phase separation could induce fractionation. In contrast, elevated delta Cl-37 can be explained by partial scavenging and fractionation during subsurface gas-liquid interaction. Hence, strong Cl isotope fractionation leading to very high delta Cl-37 in Poas' fumaroles indicates that they followed a wet pathway. Highest delta Cl-37 values in the lake water were found mostly in periods when it received a significant input from subaqueous fumaroles or when high temperatures and low pH caused HCl evaporation. It is concluded that combined monitoring of delta Cl-37 and Br/Cl in Laguna Caliente and adjacent fumaroles provides valuable information on activity in the subsurface hydro thermal system with significant relevance for volcanic surveillance of Pods.

Diversity and distribution of foraminifera and tintinnids (bio-indicators) from Pulicat Lake, India	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												The foraminifera and tintinnids are essential indicators of the health status of marine and estuarine ecosystems, both past and present, and can be used for monitoring purposes in the future. Tintinnids are known to group among ciliates possessing hard loricate to be considered by hydrogeologists as one of the bio-indicator species, exhibiting a strong positive correlation with phytoplankton. Pulicat Lake is a marginal marine environment present near the south coast of India. Intertidal sediment samples were collected from September 2013 to August 2014 and were subjected to isolate the foraminiferans and tintinnids by adopting standard methods. In all, twenty-one genera and 24 species of foraminifera have been identified from the stream, where Quinquelina seminulum was found to be abundant. Contrary to this, a minimum number of species was present in the freshwater inflow zone, mainly Amomalinula glabrata, Haplophragmoides kirki, Natlandia secasensi and Valvulineria candeiana. Tintinnopsis are recorded in the sampling sites, belonging to 5 families and 6 genera, and 12 species have been identified, and among these Favella campanula species was found to be abundant in the study area. From our results, the recorded species in terms of numerical abundance of foraminiferans appeared predominant over the tintinnids. The dominant role of foraminiferans may be a significant contribution to the carbon cycle of marine/estuarine ecosystems proved elsewhere in turn responsible for the substantial uptake of phytodetritus deposition. Based on these findings, our preliminary study may be useful to explore the carbon sequestration process in the Pulicat Lake ecosystem.																			0173-9565	1439-0485				FEB	2024	45	1								10.1111/maec.12787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.12787		DEC 2023											WOS:001117953900001
J	Huhn, U				Huhn, Ulrike			To each his kind of water, or "Why are the guards at the Holy Lake?" Festive culture and religion in postwar Soviet society	CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE												Ulrike Huhn To each his kind of water, or "Why are the guards at the Holy Lake?" Festive culture and religion in postwar Soviet society The turnabout in the relationship between the Soviet State and the Orthodox Church in 1943 led to an unexpected resurgence of religious traditions that had vanished from the public sphere in the 1930s. This article analyzes the specific forms taken by rural feasts during the postwar years until the early 1960s and focuses on a pilgrimage site called Svetloiar in Gor'kii region. The reemerging summer pilgrimage of Svetloiar happened to coincide with the local patron saint's day and the related, but largely secularized parish feast. It was this ambivalence in local tradition that enabled even representatives of the state among them guards of a nearby Gulag camp to take part in the festivity even though its overlap with the reemerging religious practice challenged the state's monopoly over public space. Yet, boundaries became further blurred by the fact that participation in the pilgrimage and parish feast did not follow the distinction between "progressive" Soviet officials and "backward" pilgrims but rather accepted gender divisions. The parish feast of "Svetloiar" also provided an experience of community that by then should have been the work of Soviet mass celebrations. But the efforts to implement the Soviet festival calendar had not reached the Soviet countryside. It was not until Khrushchev's antireligious campaigns of the late 1950s that a new attempt was made to introduce new Soviet feasts in order to attract the rural population and convince it of the Soviet project after years of impoverishment and exploitation.																			1252-6576					OCT-DEC	2011	52	4					591	+																WOS:000208623100003
J	Ott I; Laugaste, R				Ott, I; Laugaste, R			Organic matter and the composition of Volvocales and Chlorococcales in Estonian small lakes	BIOLOGIA												The limnological data gathered mainly between 1951 and 1995 were summarized from the point of view of relationships between organic substances and chlorococcalean and volvocalean species in summer. During the last forty years the role of Chlorococcales (including the biomass values) rose in all lake groups as well as the content of organic compounds. Chlorococcales and Volvocales are especially important (abundance and number of species) in the investigated lakes where the amount of easily degradable allochthonous organic compounds has risen. Simple correlations between the different characteristics of organic compounds, biomass, and the number of species are generally weak. Correlations are stronger with BOD values. Heavy allochthonous organic load from different sources may cause water bloom by Chlorococcales and Volvocales. The highest Values were recorded from Lake Harku in Tallinn because of sewage water from the city (biomass 46.1 g/m(3), Scenedesmus quadricauda (TURPIN) BREB. sensu CHODAT, Pediastrum boryanum (TURPIN) MENEGHINI; Partsi Kortsijarv (dairy industry, 32.1 g/m(3), Tetraedron minimum (A. BRAUN) HANSG., Scenedesmus quadricauda); Kooraste Linajarv (flax retting, 15 g/m(3), Dictyosphaerium pulchellum Wood); L. Ruusmae (manure, 14.5 g/m(3), Coelastrum microporum NAGELI and Eudorina elegans EHRENB.). The most common alga in the lakes with a high content of easily degradable organic matter is Phacotus coccifer KORSHIKOV. In some cases, allochthonous DOM could be the factor that control the development of phytoplankton. During the last four decades the number of species and abundance of Volvocales and Chlorococcales has increased, and lakes have become more similar to ponds and sewage treatment pools.

J	Koltermann, CE; Gorelick, SM				Koltermann, CE; Gorelick, SM			Heterogeneity in sedimentary deposits: A review of structure-imitating, process-imitating, and descriptive approaches	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Numerical models that solve governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport are commonly applied to analyze quantitatively the effects of heterogeneity. These models require maps of spatially variable hydraulic properties. Because complete three-dimensional information about hydraulic properties is never obtainable, numerous methods have been developed to interpolate between data values and use geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical information to create images of aquifer properties. Image creation approaches fall into three general categories: structure-imitating. process-imitating, and descriptive. Structure-imitating methods rely on one or more of the following to constrain the geometry of spatial patterns in geologic media: correlated random fields, probabilistic rules, and deterministic constraints developed from facies relations. Structure-imitating methods include spatial statistical algorithms and geologically based sedimentation pattern-matching approaches. Process-imitating models include aquifer model calibration methods and geologic process models. Aquifer model calibration methods use governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport to relate hydraulic properties to heads and solute information through history and steady state data matching. Geologic process models combine fundamental laws of conservation of mass and momentum with sediment transport equations to simulate spatial patterns in grain size distributions, At the sedimentary basin scale, multiprocess models include thermomechanical mechanisms of basin subsidence. Descriptive methods couple geologic observations with facies relations to divide an aquifer into zones of characteristic hydraulic properties. All approaches are capable of reproducing heterogeneity over a range of scales and considering some types of geologic information. Some approaches are strictly spatial while some are linked to the time evolution of sedimentation. Some approaches can be conditioned on measurements. Recent advances aimed at infusing geologic information into images of the subsurface include extracting more information from sedimentological facies models, incorporating qualitative geologic information into random field generators and simulating depositional processes. Classes of research missing from the literature include multiprocess models that incorporate diagenesis and three-dimensional surface water flow, hybrid methods that combine features of existing approaches, and approaches that can make use of all available geologic, geophysical, and hydrologic data.

The species were selected to represent largely different natural environments ranging from mountain snow and high elevation lakes on one extreme and shaded thermal springs and soil on another. The study was aimed at the identification of algal species whose photosynthetic apparatus was either extremely sensitive or resistant to enhanced UV-B radiation. Samples of algae were exposed to 2 W . m(-2) of artificial UV-B radiation for 2 hours. The response of the algae to the UV-B exposure was monitored by following changes in photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates and changes in the PAM fluorescence emission. The most UV-B susceptible algal species lost 30-50% of their oxygen evolving capacity during the UV-B exposure. On the other extreme, UV-B exposure stimulated the oxygen evolving capacity of some algal species by as much as 20 %. The emission of chlorophyll fluorescence from algae was also modified by the UV-B exposure with F-m declining and F-o rising. The quantitative correlation between the UV-B-induced changes in oxygen evolving capacity and the fluorescence parameters was found to be weak for F-o and for photochemical quenching (q(p)), while, in most species, the correlation was strong for F-v/F-m and Phi(e). The impact of the UV-B exposure on the capacity of the algae to develop non-photochemical quenching was largely species-dependent. Most UV-B-resistant algae have large cell cross-sections or are growing in large-sized colonies or cenobia that provide effective shading of the internal structures. Alternatively, UV-B-sensitive species tended to be small sized or filamentous. A high fraction of UV-B-resistant species was found among algae originally isolated from mountainous, sun-exposed locations. They have frequently a solid cell wall containing sporopollenin.

Comparison of fish community metrics between natural and modified open coast shorelines in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Various shoreline hardening structures are used in open coast environments to reduce erosion caused by wind and wave action and protect infrastructure. As modifications to natural shorelines are increasingly applied, it is important to identify hardening techniques that have minimal negative effects on local fish communities. We compared five fish community metrics (catch, species richness, indices of biotic integrity (IBI) and productivity (HPI), and the presence of non-pelagic fishes) among seven open coast shoreline types sampled during the summer in Lake Ontario, Canada. Using an Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation approach to account for spatial autocorrelation, best fit generalized linear models were identified for each fish community metric based on shoreline types, environmental factors, and proximity features. Artificial groynes (armourstone barriers protruding into the lake) and mixed shorelines (multiple shoreline types) tended to have similar fish community metrics to natural shorelines (sand, mixed, and gravel beaches) and higher metric values than revetments (sloped armourstone shorelines). Catch declined with increasing water temperature at the time of sampling. Sampling sites in close proximity to areas that could provide shelter (e.g., harbours) had higher species richness, IBI scores, and were more likely to contain non-pelagic fishes. This suggests that while some artificial shoreline types have similar fish community metrics to more natural open coast areas and may thus be preferable, local environmental conditions and the proximity of features that can provide shelter from wind and wave action are critical considerations when planning and evaluating shoreline hardening in large waterbodies like the Laurentian Great Lakes.																			0380-1330					APR	2025	51	2							102513	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102513		MAR 2025											WOS:001449923300001

The T0 coal seam in the Latrobe Valley: a revised age and implications to Traralgon Formation stratigraphy	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												When you are missing pieces from the jigsaw, the result may be attractive and even comprehensible, but it is incomplete. The conventional geological picture of the 'Traralgon Formation' in the Gippsland Basin includes a variety of ages, uses and concepts, and the formation's type section at Loy Yang has never been dated by palynology. The inclusion of new palynological data from bores at Loy Yang and elsewhere in the onshore part of the Gippsland Basin presents a more complete picture that reinterprets the age and distribution of the coal seams. The new data indicate that the Traralgon Formation coal seams in the Loy Yang area of the Latrobe Valley and the Lake Wellington Depression mostly comprise the youngest T0 coal seams, with Upper Nothofagidites asperus Zone (early Oligocene) ages. The Traralgon Formation coals in the Gormandale Syncline and Seaspray Depression, however, are mainly T1 and T2 coal seams of Middle and Lower Nothofagidites asperus Zone (late and middle Eocene) ages. The Rosedale Monocline, situated between the Latrobe Valley-Lake Wellington and Gormandale-Seaspray depressions, acted as a hinge that reversed movements at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Using quantitative palynology, the paleoclimates of the T0 seam are examined where it straddles the transition between the Eocene 'greenhouse' and the Oligocene 'icehouse'. In the Seaspray and Lake Wellington depressions below the T0 coal is an up to 150 m-thick regressive barrier sand of the upper Eocene Dutson Sand Member. The regression indicates that the climate transition began before end-Eocene and continued into the lower T0 coal. Mean annual temperatures (MATs) fell sharply from 16-17 degrees C to 14-16 degrees C to be <= 14 degrees C in the latest Eocene-earliest Oligocene. The lower T0 coal seams comprise a semi-continuous terrestrial record through the earliest Oligocene (the Oil glaciation event), marking the first significant glaciations in Antarctica. The upper part of T0 seam indicates a warmer, mesothermal climate, and MATs generally within the range of 14-16 degrees C.																			0812-0099	1440-0952				AUG 18	2021	68	6					763	781		10.1080/08120099.2021.1876762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2021.1876762		JAN 2021											WOS:000616927700001

However, they hold interest to many researchers in that these environments have similar geological and geochemical characteristics as those found in lithified strata on Mars. Fieldwork indicated that Lake Brown, located in Western Australia, possessed pH values of 3.1-4.5 and salinity between 13.0-23.0%. Water column, groundwater, and sediment samples were collected from the lake during the austral winter of 2005. These samples were analyzed with both traditional culture and molecular methods. Modified growth media and minimal media were designed to match the composition (Cl, Na, Mg, SO4, K, Ca, and Br) of Lake Brown surface and ground waters for the enrichment of microorganisms. One of the isolates obtained, Brown 1, can grow in media that possesses pH values of 3-7 with optimal growth at pH 4, salinity that ranged from 5% to saturation with optimal growth at 5% and could grow under temperatures that ranged from 20 degrees C to 65 degrees C with optimal grow occurring at 37 degrees C. The isolate's optimum growth conditions are similar to those found in Lake Brown. The isolate is a Gram-negative rod that forms yellow colonies on 17% Phytogel. Its 16S rRNA gene can be amplified with bacteria] primers but not with archaeal primers. Its 16S rRNA gene sequence suggests that the isolate is a gamma proteobacterium. Studies on organisms isolated from environments such as Lake Brown, an acid hypersaline lake, can provide an opportunity to both expand our knowledge of terrestrial extremophiles and gain insight on the possible forms of life that might have existed on Mars.					; Hong, Bo-young/AAQ-1679-2021	Mormile, Melanie/0000-0001-9054-2687; Oboh-Ikuenobe, Francisca/0000-0002-2223-9691; Hong, Bo-Young/0000-0001-5055-0893													0277-786X		978-0-8194-6842-0				2007	6694								66940X	10.1117/12.734741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.734741													WOS:000251489700026

Climate variability and forecasting surface water recovery from acidification: Modelling drought-induced sulphate release from wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate-induced drought events have been shown to have a significant influence on sulphate (SO42-)) export from forested catchments in central Ontario, subsequently delaying recovery of surface waters from acidification. Field and modelling studies have demonstrated that water table drawdown during drought periods promotes oxidation of previously stored (reduced) sulphur X Of (S) compounds in wetlands, with subsequent efflux of SO42- upon re-wetting. Although climate-induced changes in processes are generally not integrated into soil-acidification models, MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments) includes a wetland compartment that incorporates redox processes driven by drought events. The potential confounding influence of climate-induced drought events on acidification recovery at Plastic Lake, south-central Ontario (under proposed future S emission reductions) was investigated using MAGIC and two climate scenarios: monthly precipitation and runoff based on long-term means (average-climate scenario), and variable precipitation and runoff based on the past 20 years of observed monthly data (variable-climate scenario). The variable-climate scenario included several periods of summer drought owing to lower than average rainfall and higher then average temperature. Nonetheless, long-term regional trends in precipitation and temperature suggest that the variable-climate scenario may be a conservative estimate of future climate. The average-climate scenario indicated good recovery potential with acid neutralising capacity (ANC) reaching approximately 40 mu mol(c)L(-1) by 2020 and 50 mu mol(c)L(-1) by 2080. In contrast, the forecasted recovery potential under the variable-climate scenario was very much reduced. By 2080, ANC was forecasted to increase to 2.6 mu mol(c)L(-1) from -10.0 mu mol(c)L(-1) in 2000. Elevated SO42- efflux following drought events (introduced under the variable-climate scenario) has a dramatic impact on simulated future surface water chemistry. The results clearly demonstrate that prediction of future water quality, using models such as MAGIC, should take into account changes or variability in climate as well as acid deposition.

They are also rich in various chemical substances and can enter the human body and cause harm to human health. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of particulate matter in different air pollution processes using the vertical profile data of multiple aerosol lidars and regional air quality monitoring data from 2018 to 2019 in Jining City. The results show that there are certain regional differences in fine particle pollution in Jining City during the summer, and there are mainly two diurnal characteristics. One is that some areas have strong extinction at night and weak extinction in the daytime, mainly because they are affected by the superposition of high humidity and pollution source emissions at night. On the other hand, some areas have relatively strong daytime extinction and no obvious diurnal variation, which is due to less pollution sources and artificial lakes. Moreover, the near-surface aerosol extinction coefficient variation showed that the concentration of particulate matter near Chenxin Pharmaceutical Station and Jinma Hotel Station was relatively higher. Dust observation results show that the dust weather in Jining city mainly occurs in April and May, and the concentration of particulate matter in the sedimentation process can be as high as 5 times the normal concentration. Additionally, the contrast scanning observation shows that the profile of local pollution is irregular, small in scope, burst and strong in extinction, while the profile of large-scale pollution process is extensive in area, and its extinction gradually increases.

Simulation of the Contribution of Phosphorus-Containing Minerogenic Particles to Particulate Phosphorus Concentration in Cayuga Lake, New York	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Phosphorus (P) associated with minerogenic particles delivered from watersheds can interfere with the common use of total P (TP) concentration as a trophic state metric in lacustrine systems, particularly proximate to tributary entries, because of its limited bioavailability. The concentration of unavailable minerogenic particulate P (PPm/u), where it is noteworthy, should be subtracted from TP in considering primary production potential and trophic state levels. A first mass balance model for PPm/u is developed and tested here for Cayuga Lake, New York. This is supported by a rare combination of detailed information for minerogenic particle level dynamics for the tributaries and lake, the bioavailability of tributary particulate P (PP), and previously tested hydrothermal/transport and minerogenic particle concentration submodels. The central roles of major runoff events and localized tributary loading at one end of the lake in driving patterns of PPm/u in time and space are well simulated, including (1) the higher PPm/u concentrations in a shallow area ("Bshelf") adjoining the inputs, relative to pelagic waters, following runoff events, and (2) the positive dependence of the shelf increases on the magnitude of the event. The PPm/u component of P was largely responsible for the higher summer average TP on the shelf vs. pelagic waters and the exceedance of a TP water quality limit on the shelf. The effective simulation of PPm/u allows an appropriate adjustment of TP values to avoid overrepresentation of potential primary production levels.					; Chapra, Steven/A-5752-2008; Kuczynski, Anika/V-6225-2019	Gelda, Rakesh/0000-0002-4741-5989; Kuczynski, Anika/0000-0003-2084-8941; Prestigiacomo, Anthony/0000-0002-9792-8600													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2016	227	11							421	10.1007/s11270-016-3116-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3116-4													WOS:000388218600020

Consequently, the susceptibility of current livestock operations to experience manure spills is far greater relative to livestock farms 20 years ago, due to increased herd size per farm. Therefore, manure spills in agricultural communities have become a pervasive issue and have led to the catastrophic contributions of nutrients and pathogens to surface and groundwaters, human health issues, and large fish kills. Furthermore, the current remediation methods for manure spills that reach surface waters focus on mitigating contaminants in the water column and give no attention to the manure-exposed ditch sediments that remain in the fluvial system and continue to impair the water column. Therefore, this chapter addresses the causes, environmental impacts, and current and alternative remediation methods for manure spills in agricultural streams. Geographic data suggest that the location of animal-feeding operations and the occurrence of manure spills were highly correlated with the location of tile-drained agriculture fields. In addition, at least 14% of reported manure spills were separately attributed to the failure in waste storage equipment and over-application of manure in the states of Iowa and Ontario, Canada. Evaluations of the downstream impacts of manure spills have reported ammonia, total phosphorus, and total N concentrations that were at least 28 times the average upstream concentrations before the spill occurred. Studies have also determined that the current manure spill remediation method results in soluble phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations significantly greater than the Environmental Protection Agency total phosphorus nutrient critical limit, 24 h after the plume of the spill has passed. However, supplemental treatment of manure exposed sediments resulted in at least a 50% decrease in the soluble phosphorus concentrations which was in compliance with the phosphorus nutrient criteria.																			2210-4410	2210-4429	978-90-481-8740-9				2010	4						201	215		10.1007/978-90-481-8741-6_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-8741-6_7	10.1007/978-90-481-8741-6												WOS:000278926800007
J	Terwilliger, MR; Markle, DF; Kann, J				Terwilliger, MR; Markle, DF; Kann, J			Associations between water quality and daily growth of juvenile shortnose and lost river suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Poor water quality from hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Lake in south-central Oregon has been suspected of contributing to the recruitment failure of two endangered endemic fish species, the Lost River sucker Deltistes luxatus and the shortnose sucker Chasmistes brevirostris. We used otolith daily increment widths as a proxy for juvenile somatic growth to construct two growth models: (1) a linear mixed-effects (LME) model examining the lifetime effects of lakewide averages of potentially stressful daytime water temperature, pH, and nighttime dissolved oxygen (DO), and (2) a simple linear regression model examining the effects of locally measured water temperature, pH, and daytime DO on growth of fish over 3 d before the fish's capture. Graphical relationships between daily growth and biweekly un-ionized ammonia failed to show a sublethal effect on the growth of suckers captured in areas where un-ionized ammonia surpassed levels lethal to both species. For both species, our LME models indicated that at temperatures greater than approximately 22degreesC, low nighttime DO (less than 4 mg/L for Lost River suckers and less than 1 mg/L for shortnose suckers) caused enough stress to reduce growth, whereas at temperatures less than approximately 22degreesC, any stress from low nighttime DO was not reflected in reduced growth. We attribute the pattern to the species' tolerance of low DO, the short duration of nighttime events, the fish's increased oxygen demand at higher temperatures, and growth compensation due to increased food resources associated with low DO. The combination of low DO and high temperature has also been implicated in adult fish kills in Upper Klamath Lake. Because 34% of the time lakewide August average temperatures exceeded 22degreesC, extended periods of warm temperatures and high primary production could affect the sizes of recruits surviving into fall. Both growth models suggested that shortnose suckers might be more tolerant of poor water quality than Lost River suckers.

This review summarizes available information from diverse Holocene paleoenvironmental records across eastern Beringia (Alaska, westernmost Canada and adjacent seas), and it quantifies the primary trends of temperature- and moisture-sensitive records based in part on midges, pollen, and biogeochemical indicators (compiled in the recently published Arctic Holocene database, and updated here to v2.1). The composite time series from these proxy records are compared with new summaries of mountain-glacier and lake-level fluctuations, terrestrial water-isotope records, sea-ice and sea-surface-temperature analyses, and peatland and thaw-lake initiation frequencies to clarify multi-centennial- to millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate change. To focus the synthesis, the paleo data are used to frame specific questions that can be addressed with simulations by Earth system models to investigate the causes and dynamics of past and future climate change. This systematic review shows that, during the early Holocene (11.7-8.2 ka; 1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), rather than a prominent thermal maximum as suggested previously, temperatures were highly variable, at times both higher and lower than present (approximate mid-20th-century average), with no clear spatial pattern. Composited pollen, midge and other proxy records average out the variability and show the overall lowest summer and mean-annual temperatures across the study region during the earliest Holocene, followed by warming over the early Holocene. The sparse data available on early Holocene glaciation show that glaciers in southern Alaska were as extensive then as they were during the late Holocene. Early Holocene lake levels were low in interior Alaska, but moisture indicators show pronounced differences across the region. The highest frequency of both peatland and thaw-lake initiation ages also occurred during the early Holocene. During the middle Holocene (8.2-4.2 ka), glaciers retreated as the regional average temperature increased to a maximum between 7 and 5 ka, as reflected in most proxy types. Following the middle Holocene thermal maximum, temperatures decreased starting between 4 and 3 ka, signaling the onset of Neoglacial cooling. Glaciers in the Brooks and Alaska Ranges advanced to their maximum Holocene extent as lakes generally rose to modern levels. Temperature differences for averaged 500-year time steps typically ranged by 1-2 degrees C for individual records in the Arctic Holocene database, with a transition to a cooler late Holocene that was neither abrupt nor spatially coherent. The longest and highest-resolution terrestrial water isotope records previously interpreted to represent changes in the Aleutian low-pressure system around this time are here shown to be largely contradictory. Furthermore, there are too few records with sufficient resolution to identify sub-centennial-scale climate anomalies, such as the 8.2 ka event. The review concludes by suggesting some priorities for future paleoclimate research in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Macroinvertebrate communities of non-glacial high altitude intermittent streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of five non-glacial intermittent high altitude headwater streams (above 1400 m - Serra da Estrela, Portugal), with dry periods of different lengths (0-3 months), were investigated in nearly undisturbed conditions to (i) examine spatial differences and identify environmental variables responsible for the observed invertebrate patterns, (ii) assess the association of dry period length with invertebrate community structure and (iii) determine the influence of using different taxonomic identification levels (order, family and genus) to assess invertebrate community patterns. 2. More than 100 macroinvertebrate genera were identified. Insects clearly dominated these communities with more than 95% of total captures and around 95% of the total richness. Diptera were the most rich and abundant group with chironomid occurrences comprising over 70% of macroinvertebrate captures. 3. The highest taxon richness, diversity, EPT (Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera) and OCH (Odonata + Coleoptera + Heteroptera) genus richness, the greatest number of exclusive and characteristic taxa identified by the Indicator Value (IndVal), and a distinct community structure shown by Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA), were found in the only stream that was never totally dry, with pools lasting over summer. Environmental gradients that spatially structured the macroinvertebrate communities were always related to flow variations. 4. Over time, the highest abundances found in these systems were also related to flow variations and maximum genus richness occurred in the connected pools or in isolated pools. Streams with longer dry periods presented a distinct recolonization phase, with higher abundance of the stonefly larvae Nemoura sp. and the presence of the chironomid larvae Krenosmittia sp., possibly arriving from the hyporheos. 5. Taxonomic level of invertebrate identification was vital for recognizing the characteristic taxa (IndVal) of streams yet was not critical for identifying streams with the highest macroinvertebrate richness/diversity or structuring environmental gradients. 6. Overall, this study emphasizes the variability of high altitude intermittent streams macroinvertebrate communities, despite spatial proximity. This variability was probably related to flow intermittency and hydrologic permanence, different vegetation covers and riverbed substrata. Consequently, the establishment of reference conditions should involve long-term data collections and more detailed physical characterization. Also, these findings have significant implications for accurately predicting the ecological consequences of future climate change in high altitude scenarios.					; Chaves, Maria/B-3937-2012; Costa, J.L./B-2188-2012; Chainho, Paula/B-3935-2012; Prat, Narcis/D-4405-2014; Costa, Maria Jose/B-4007-2012; Costa, Maria/B-4007-2012	Chaves, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-9313-1824; Chainho, Paula/0000-0002-3539-9942; Prat, Narcis/0000-0002-1550-1305; Costa, Maria Jose/0000-0002-9089-7266; Costa, Jose Lino/0000-0002-3843-4635; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2008	53	1					55	76		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01867.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01867.x													WOS:000251629900005
J	Vetter, M; Sousa, A				Vetter, Mark; Sousa, Arturo			Past and current trophic development in Lake Ammersee - Alterations in a normal range or possible signals of climate change?	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												In the past decades, nutrient concentrations in several pre-Alpine lakes in central Europe have increased due to human activity in the catchment area. Here, we examine whether this trend will continue in the future, through our analysis of the development of the trophic status, over a period of 25 years (1984-2009), of the pre-Alpine, dimictic tempered Lake Ammersee (South-Eastern Germany). The lake showed signs of an elevated eutrophic status until the 1990s. Immense management activities in the catchment area led to a reduction in the nutrient load in the tributaries. The study of dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a revealed a substantial improvement in the trophic conditions of the lake. We identified a transition period in the development of trophic levels during the years 1996/1997. Therefore, our investigation is divided into two periods: 1984-1996 and 1997-2009. By comparing values during these two periods, we found that the annual mean TP concentrations of the complete water column declined from 18.2 mu g l(-1) (1984-1996) to 8.8 mu g l(-1) (1997-2009). During this period the chlorophyll-a values are in relationship to other trophic variables such as TP, dissolved oxygen and sight depths (R-2 between 0.41 and 0.56). At the same time, during the summer months, the surface temperature in the epilimnion increased (by about 0.8 K per decade), which was approximately in line with the thermal increase (about 0.6 K per decade) in the northern hemisphere (Pearson's correlation coefficient, omitting 2006, of 0.81). In conclusion, in the case of Lake Ammersee, a decrease in nutrient input has led, most recently (1997-2009), to a substantial improvement in the trophic state. This improvement is fundamentally a result of measures taken to correct any anthropogenic impact. Nevertheless, we show that the thermal stability of the lake reacts to climate-triggered alterations. Therefore it seems that the impact of recent climate change on trophic conditions will have to be monitored closely in the future.

J	Bennett, B; Jiang, CQ				Bennett, Barry; Jiang, Chunqing			Oil-source and oil-oil correlations and the origin of the heavy oil and bitumen accumulations in Northern Alberta, Canada	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon compositions of potential source rock samples from the Devonian/Carboniferous Duvernay, Exshaw, and Lower Banff formations, the Triassic Doig Formation, and the Jurassic Gordondale (Nordegg) and Poker Chip Shale formations in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The study also included produced oils from the Cretaceous Clearwater play at Marten Hills and Peace River, oil sands cores from Athabasca and Cold Lake areas, and bitumen hosted in the Grosmont carbonate deposits. Oil-oil and oil-source correlation based on the aromatic steroid hydrocarbon compounds is enabled by their strong resistance to biodegradation and their presence in all reservoir samples analyzed. In addition, of the aromatic steroids hydrocarbons, triaromatic-dimethylcholesteroids (TA-DMC) and triaromatic dinosteroids represent age-diagnostic biomarkers that distinguish Paleozoic versus Jurassic sources. The Duvernay, Exshaw, and Lower Banff extracts lack TA-DMC and triaromatic dinosteroids, whereas extracts from the Gordondale and Poker Chip Shale display appreciable quantities of TA-DMC and triaromatic dinosteroids. Meanwhile, the Doig falls between the Gordondale/Poker Chip Shale and Duvernay/Exshaw source types in terms of the distribution of these triaromatic steroids. The compositions of TA-DMC and triaromatic dinosteroids in the oil sands and Grosmont bitumen are remarkably similar, confirming that these oil deposits are genetically related. The aromatic steroid hydrocarbon compositions of the oil sands and Grosmont bitumen most strongly resemble those for the Gordondale and Poker Chip Shale. Saturated biomarker features of the oil sands and Grosmont carbonate bitumen including 28,30-bisnorhopane and high diasteranes relative to regular steranes, although lacking in the Gordondale extracts, may be introduced through mixing with oil generated from the Poker Chip Shale. However, plots based on aromatic steroids and source-specific biomarkers such as aryl and diaryl iso-prenoids indicate some degree of mixing with Duvernay and/or Exshaw contributions. This is also supported by a mixing model employing the averaged concentrations of methyltriaromatic steroids from endmember Gordondale and Exshaw extracts. These findings along with additional biomarker evidence support a strong Jurassic contribution to the studied oil sands and call for re-evaluation of the petroleum systematics of the WCSB.

Afourgagh is a small, shallow permanent lake located in the Middle-Atlas Mountains in Morocco in a karstic context. It is fed by ground waters that are relatively enriched in Mg resulting from the leaching of the Jurassic dolomitic bedrock of the catchment. This eutrophic lake is episodically restricted and characterized by alkaline waters with a fluctuating high Mg/Ca ratio. The maximum extension of the Holocene shoreline coincides with evidence of a lake stabilization level corresponding to the outflow of the lake through a wadi. Lakeshore terrace sediments deposited on an alluvial fan siltstone during the past ca 2500cal yr bp comprise four main facies: a littoral crust, palaeosols, palustrine silts and charophyte tufas, which reflect different environments from the shoreline toward the deeper water. In the more distal parts, the charophyte tufas display a well-expressed lamination punctuated by the development of microstromatolites on algae thalli. The mineralogical composition of the carbonates is linked to the facies. While the charophyte tufas are characterized by a relatively high content in aragonite, in addition to low-Mg calcite, the littoral crust is mainly composed of magnesite. This pattern is related to the evolving chemistry of water due to the influence of charophyte proliferation during dry summers. Calcium-carbonate precipitation on algae thalli (both bioinduced and microbially mediated) progressively induces an increase in the Mg/Ca ratio of the lake water, while the capillary evaporation of shallow ground waters causes precipitation of a magnesite precursor on the shoreline, producing magnesite during early diagenesis. This effect is characteristic of two episodes: part of the Roman Warm Period and the beginning of the Dark Age Cold Period. The carbonate mineralogy of the different depositional sequences at Afourgagh indicates lake-level and water-chemistry fluctuations under a climatic influence. Therefore, among other regional records, the Lake Afourgagh sedimentary record provides useful evidence for reconstructing these environmental changes.

J	Hamasaki, S				Hamasaki, S			Volcanic-related alteration and geochemistry of Iwodake volcano, Satsuma-Iwojima, Kyushu, SW Japan	EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE												Satsuma-Iwojima is located near the northwestern margin of Kikai caldera, and active Mt. Iwodake is one of the post-caldera cones. Inside the summit crater of about 300 m diameter and 50 m depth, volcanic gas with maximum temperature >800degreesC is discharged. At Iwodake, the rhyolite is strongly altered by volcanic vapor and acid hydrothermal solution inside and around the summit crater. The main alteration mineral assemblages at surface include quartz-tridymite-cristobalite, tridymite-cristobalite-alunite and cristobalite-(alunite) inside the summit crater and on the flank. Molybdenum blue sublimates are forming at the surface around high-temperature fumaroles inside the summit crater. The ground surface is commonly cemented by amorphous silica or cristobalite. The original rhyolite with SiO2 = 71-72 wt% has been leached, resulting in a rock with maximum SiO2 = 97 wt%. All major elements are leached except for TiO2. Although LIL (large-ion lithophile) elements have leached, HFS (high field-strength) elements appear to be immobile. Rare earth elements are considered to have been soluble as a complex with sulfate mainly in the low pH hydrothermal fluid during the silicification of the rhyolite. There is abundant Mo, Pb, Zn, Bi, Sn and much lower As in the volcanic sublimates and altered rocks inside the summit crater. By contrast, the rocks near the acid springs at the foot of the cone are As-rich, but with lower Pb, Zn, Bi and little Mo in comparison with the summit. The fractures and fumarole locations around Iwodake summit and erosional ridges on the flanks reflects a NE-SW trend that is parallel to the trace of the outer ring of Kikai caldera. In addition, this is the same direction as the alignment of Shin-Iwojima, Iwodake and Inamuradake, all of which are post-caldera cones. Zones of structural weakness parallel to the caldera rim may exist, acting as pathways for the ascending volcanic gases and hydrothermal solutions. Fumarolic activity appears to be shifting gradually to the eastern part of the summit crater.																			1343-8832						2002	54	3					217	229		10.1186/BF03353021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/BF03353021													WOS:000174523300006

These rocks are highly potassic, with major- and trace-element characteristics closely resembling those of shoshonitic lavas in modem island arcs, Other examples of Archean alkaline rocks are limited to rare, volumetrically insignificant lamprophyric dikes and syenitic intrusions, Archean alkaline rocks similar to those of modem oceanic islands have not been reported, The oldest oceanic island suites are found in the 2.0-1.9 Ga Circum-Superior Belt of Canada which contains several successions of transitional to strongly alkaline volcanic rocks, Explanations for the paucity of Precambrian alkaline rocks fall into two main categories, (a) Alkaline magmatism was not uncommon in the Precambrian, but the rocks that formed did not survive, The alkaline rocks may have been destroyed preferentially because they formed late-stage volcanoes composed of friable pyroclastics and unstable feldspathoids, and were thus particularly vulnerable to erosion, Alternatively, the alkaline rock sequences may have erupted as part of a volcanic series that did not normally become incorporated in growing Archean continents, as would have been the case if oceanic plateaus made up the bulk of greenstone belts. (b) Alkaline rocks may indeed have been very rare because conditions in the Archean mantle were not appropriate for the formation of this type of magma, Higher temperatures may have led to more extensive partial melting, such that low-degree melts either were not produced or were overwhelmed by high-degree melts, Other possible factors include lower CO2 contents in melting regions, which inhibited the formation of silica-undersaturated magmas, and the absence of metasomatized lower lithosphere, which precluded the formation of rift-type magmas, The late-Archean shoshonites apparently formed in a subduction environment, At present our knowledge of Archean volcanic rocks and Archean tectonic processes is insufficient to decide between the various possible interpretations.

J	Bouchnak, R; Steinberg, CEW				Bouchnak, Rihab; Steinberg, Christian E. W.			Algal diets and natural xenobiotics impact energy allocation in cladocerans. II. Moina macrocopa and Moina micrura	LIMNOLOGICA												In freshwater lakes, changing mineral and biochemical food qualities as well as exposure to natural xenobiotics, such as humic substances (HSs) are common challenges to life history traits of zooplankters. In this contribution, we tested the bottom-up effect of different food qualities alone and in concert with exposure to increasing HS concentrations in a clone of each Moina micrura (inhabitant of Brazilian coastal lagoons) and Moina macrocopa (invasive species). Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents, fatty acid (FA) and the amino acid (AA) patterns of three coccal green algae of the summer aspect in the lagoons were analyzed. All algae were deficient in P, differed in their content of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), histidine, and arginine and were lacking long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs >C18). M. micrura did not grow on Desmodesmus armatus. Maximal mean lifespan and total lifespan reproduction were achieved on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. M. macrocopa fed all algae offered. Multiple regressions showed that ALA triggered longevity and the P-content reproduction. Exposure to HSs revealed that M. micrura reduced either its lifespan on Monoraphidium minutum or its reproduction on P. subcapitata. Conversely in M. macrocopa, lifespan on M. minutum was extended by a factor of 1.7 and offspring numbers increased by 1.4 upon HS exposure. On D. armatus an originally very low reproductive output increased maximal by a factor 4.6. Relating HS-mediated lifespan and offspring modulations of the 1.08 mM exposure to food components, it appears that ALA controls lifespan modulation even under HS stress, whereas offspring modulation seems to be controlled by C and total AA content. This indicates that, upon HS exposure, the investment of energy in body maintenance or reproduction would depend at least partly on the biochemical composition of the food available. This also shows that even short-chained dietary PUFAs may play a major role in keeping lipid peroxidation low. A comparison of the two Moina species tested revealed that M. macrocopa has the capacity to outcompete M. micrura, since it had the greater clutch size, never reduced the reproductive output upon HS-exposure, and fed all diets offered.

J	Perissinotto, R; Pillay, D; Bate, G				Perissinotto, Renzo; Pillay, Deena; Bate, Guy			Microalgal biomass in the St Lucia Estuary during the 2004 to 2007 drought period	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Phytoplankton and microphytobenthic biomass were investigated over a 4 yr period in the drought-stricken St Lucia Estuary, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This is the largest estuarine lake in Africa and part of the iSimangaliso Wetlands Park, South Africa's first World Heritage Site and a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The present study aimed at identifying the factors controlling the extreme variability in its ecological functioning. Water-column chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations averaged (+/-SD) 32.3 +/- 53.4 mg m(-3), with the highest value reaching 413 mg m(-3). Within the sediment, average (+/-SD) chl a concentration was 201 +/- 377 mg m(-2), with a maximum of 2576 mg m(-2). Both are among the highest values so far reported in the literature for any estuarine ecosystem and by far the highest values reported for any South African estuary. Areal phytoplankton biomass was highest in the Mouth and Narrows region, declining in the South and North lakes, while microphytobenthos showed the reverse trend. Ordinations and cluster analysis revealed that phytoplankton biomass differed between the southern and northern halves of the system, while differences in microphytobenthic biomass were found between the Narrows and the rest of the system. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were greater and lower than the Redfield optimum (16) 60% and 27% of the time, respectively, indicating that microalgal production may be limited by availability of either P or N for part of the year, with a peak in growth during summer. Water level and mouth state are key factors controlling microalgal biomass within the estuary. During the closed phase, the shallow waters and vast surface area of the lakes region led to the development of hypersaline conditions and temperatures occasionally approaching 50 degrees C. The negative effects of such extreme conditions on grazers, as well as negative correlations between grazer densities and microalgal biomass, have been documented in previous work on the system. This would suggest that the interaction between the physical environment and grazers may be important in regulating microalgal biomass in the estuary.

J	Payette, S; Delwaide, A				Payette, S; Delwaide, A			Recent permafrost dynamics in a subarctic floodplain associated with changing water levels, Quebec, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We have reconstructed from tree-rings the dynamics of mineral frost mounds on the floodplain of a subarctic river (Riviere Boniface, northern Quebec) likely associated with snow precipitation and temperature changes during the past centuries. Due to their peculiar location in the river bed, we have postulated that the inception and decay of frost mounds (thermokarst ponds) were associated with snow-controlled water levels of the river. The periods of establishment, growth, and mortality of spruce around and in two thermokarst ponds on the shore zone were identified. The oldest tree-ring dates show that permafrost mounds formed during a period of water lowering in the 17th century, likely in a long-enduring sequence of low waters initiated around cal AD 1150 (910 yr BP), which persisted for at least 200 vr until the beginning of the 20th century. Two main periods of spruce mortality were identified, in the late 19th century and early 20th century and in the 1950s-1960s, which corresponded to a rising river level probably due to greater snow precipitation. The patterns of spruce establishment and mortality were strikingly similar in the studied sites. The first spruce to establish were all located along the pond's edges and they were also the first ones to die; most of the youngest spruce established later in the central part of each feature, i.e., in the early to mid-1850s to 1910, and died during the 1950s-1960s. The sequence of events reported here suggests an important lowering of the Riviere Boniface during the first part of the Little Ice Age (end of the 16th century-17th century) which was drier and cold. During the second part of the Little Ice Age (mainly 19th century), greater precipitation occurred and climaxed in the 20th century when climate warmed and the river stage reached its maximum level. Changes in snow precipitation were probably more instrumental than temperature changes in the rise and fall of permafrost landforms because of the snowypack's direct influence on the soil thermal regime and river level during snowmelt.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2000	32	3					316	323		10.2307/1552530	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552530													WOS:000089252500010

The Lake Victoria basin has been targeted for tsetse eradication using a rolling carpet initiative, from west to east, with four operational blocks (3 in Uganda and 1 in Kenya), under a Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). We screened tsetse flies from the three Ugandan PATTEC blocks for genetic diversity at 15 microsatellite loci from continental and offshore populations to provide empirical data to support this initiative. Methods: We collected tsetse samples from 11 sites across the Lake Victoria basin in Uganda. We performed genetic analyses on 409 of the collected tsetse flies and added data collected for 278 individuals in a previous study. The flies were screened across 15 microsatellite loci and the resulting data were used to assess the temporal stability of populations, to analyze patterns of genetic exchange and structuring, to estimate dispersal rates and evaluate the sex bias in dispersal, as well as to estimate demographic parameters (N-E and N-C). Results: We found that tsetse populations in this region were stable over 4-16 generations and belong to 4 genetic clusters. Two genetic clusters (1 and 2) corresponded approximately to PATTEC blocks 1 and 2, while the other two (3 and 4) fell within PATTEC block 3. Island populations grouped into the same genetic clusters as neighboring mainland sites, suggesting presence of gene flow between these sites. There was no evidence of the stretch of water separating islands from the mainland forming a significant barrier to dispersal. Dispersal rates ranged from 2.5 km per generation in cluster 1 to 14 km per generation in clusters 3 and 4. We found evidence of male-biased dispersal. Few breeders are successfully dispersing over large distances. Effective population size estimates were low (33-310 individuals), while census size estimates ranged from 1200 (cluster 1) to 4100 (clusters 3 and 4). We present here a novel technique that adapts an existing census size estimation method to sampling without replacement, the scheme used in sampling tsetse flies. Conclusion: Our study suggests that different control strategies should be implemented for the three PATTEC blocks and that, given the high potential for re-invasion from island sites, mainland and offshore sites in each block should be targeted at the same time.

J	Talbot, MR; Jensen, NB; Lærdal, T; Filippi, ML				Talbot, MR; Jensen, NB; Lærdal, T; Filippi, ML			Geochemical responses to a major transgression in giant African Lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Bulk organic matter (OM) in sediments that accumulated in Lakes Victoria, Albert and Tanganyika during the major transgression that transformed these basins from a desiccated or lowstand condition at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum to highstand with overflow in the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, show some striking compositional trends. Sediment OM content (TOC) and Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index (HI) both rise markedly, reflecting increasing primary productivity during the transgression and enhanced conditions for the preservation of labile OM, In Lake Victoria rising sedimentary sulphur content tracks the change in HI. Over the same time interval in all three lakes, delta C-13(OM) shows a falling trend of 5-8 degrees. Nitrogen isotopic and C/N trends are, in contrast, more variable. Relatively high delta N-15 values at an early stage in the transgression may reflect isotopic effects associated with ammonia loss from an alkaline waterbody, while high delta N-15 later in the transgression was probably due to periods when stratification-related denitrification had a particularly strong impact upon the lakes' N cycle. The observed changes are attributed to the influence of the landscape drowned during the transgression upon the nutrient budget of the lake, a rise in river-supplied nutrients as the climate became wetter, and an increasing tendency to stable chemical stratification as the water column deepened. In the case of delta C-13, additional contributory factors were changes in the amount and isotopic composition of river-supplied dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as runoff and soil-moisture turnover rates increased, and the replacement of a C4-grassland dominated flora by mixed woodland-grassland and forest with a significant presence of C3 plants. Distinct geochemical changes are also apparent in Lakes Victoria and Albert sediments at the end of the transgression which are consistent with a reduction in nutrient loading. In the case of N this resulted in biological N fixation becoming a major part of the lakes' N cycle, Some of the observed geochemical variations may be generally applicable as proxy indicators of major transgressions in large lakes.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2006	35	3					467	489		10.1007/s10933-005-2828-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-2828-z													WOS:000236090300003

Recent increase in annual survival of nesting female Common ScoterMelanitta nigrain Iceland	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Despite their unfavourable conservation status, little is known about the population status, trends and demography of Common ScoterMelanitta nigra.Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from 154 recapture events of 88 individually marked breeding female Common ScoterMelanitta nigrain the Aoaldalur valley, northeast Iceland, during 2009-2018 generated an estimated annual apparent survival probability of 0.848 (95% CL 0.775-0.901). This exceeds a previous Icelandic CMR estimate (0.783, 95% CL 0.715-0.839) from nesting females during 1925-1958 at the nearby Myvatn (45 km to the SSE) when the population was declining at c. 2% per annum. Spring count data from Myvatn show that numbers of male and female Common Scoter at this important breeding site (thought to constitute over 80% of the Icelandic breeding national total) have increased by c. 1.8% per annum since 1974, and by 4-5% per annum since 2009. A population model showed that the observed change in survival corresponded well with the observed change in population growth rate. We reflect on causes of the increase in mean expected lifespan (from 4.1 to 6.1 years) between 1925-1958 and 2009-2018, speculating whether changes in food supply and/or reduction in gill-net fishing on Myvatn in the last 25 years could have been contributing factors to explain recent increases in breeding females there. An alternative, not necessarily mutually exclusive explanation could also be that the dramatic declines in chronic marine oil spill pollution in European waters could have contributed to higher recent female annual survival. While fully recognising the challenges of comparing survival rates from two sites in two different periods, survival rate has increased significantly between the two studies in a way that could potentially explain the increase in abundance at Myvatn. This could indicate that female survival has increased in the population as a whole. We strongly recommend demographic monitoring as a contribution to monitoring sea duck populations, species that are difficult to count and otherwise monitor annual changes in abundance in any meaningful way across large geographical ranges.

Climate change is predicted to be variable within Canada, and to cause considerable weather variability among years, Under a 2 x CO2 scenario, fire weather index (FWI) is predicted to rise over much of Ontario by 1.5 to 2 times, FWI may actually fall slightly, compared to current values, in central eastern Ontario (Abitibi), but for central-south Ontario it is expected to rise sharply by as much as 5 times current values, We predict that the combination of temperature rise and greater than average fire occurrence will result in a shrinkage of area covered by boreal forest towards the north and east; that some form of Great Lakes forest type will occupy most of central Ontario following the 5 C isotherm north; that pyrophilic species will become most common, especially jack pine and aspen; that patch sizes Will initially decrease then expand resulting in considerable homogenization of forest landscapes; that there will be little 'old-growth' forest; and that landscape disequilibrium will be enhanced. If climate change occurs as rapidly as is predicted, then some species particularly those with heavy seeds may not be able to respond to the rapid changes and local extinctions are expected. Anthropogenically-altered species compositions in current forests, coupled with fire suppression over the past 50 years, may lead to forest landscapes that are different then were seen in the Holocene period, as described by paleoecological reconstructions. In particular, forests dominated by white pine in the south and black spruce in the middle north may not be common. Wildlife species that respond at the landscape level, i.e., those with body sizes >1 kg, will be most affected by changes in landscape structure. in particular we expect moose and caribou populations to decline significantly, while white-tailed deer will likely become abundant across Ontario and Quebec.

J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG; Eaton, JG; McCormick, JH; Alam, SR				Fang, X; Stefan, HG; Eaton, JG; McCormick, JH; Alam, SR			Simulation of thermal/dissolved oxygen habitat for fishes in lakes under different climate scenarios - Part 2. Cold-water fish in the contiguous US	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Fish habitat is strongly constrained by water temperature and available dissolved oxygen (DO). Thermal/dissolved oxygen habitat for cold-waterfish in small lakes was therefore determined from simulated daily water temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles. Twenty-seven types of lakes were simulated with past (1961-1979) climate conditions observed at 209 weather stations in the USA, and with a 2xCO(2) climate scenario that is projected to occur at the same locations. The output of the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) General Circulation Model for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 was used to determine the climate data increments for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The methodology was described in Part 1 of this paper. Highlights of the results are as follows: winterkill that occurred due to dissolved oxygen deficiency in eutrophic and mesotrophic, shallow lakes of the north-central and northeastern US under past climate conditions, is projected to be replaced by summerkill due to elevated water temperatures in mesotrophic lakes, or by suitable fish habitat in eutrophic lakes under the 2xCO(2) climate scenario. Shallow lakes at 205 of 209 locations investigated are projected to experience summerkill of cold-water fish under the projected 2xCO(2) climate scenario. Climate warming is also projected to reduce by up to 38% of the past values the length of the good-growth period and the good-growth area/volume for cold-water fish in lakes at most locations in the contiguous US. Average reductions in the number of locations where lakes presently have suitable year-round cold-water fish habitat are 28, 90, and 65 locations for shallow, medium-depth, and deep lakes, respectively. Loss of fish habitat during the summer period (summerkill) under the projected 2xCO(2) climate scenario is a significant negative impact of climate warming on cold-water fish in lakes of the contiguous US. Geographic regions in which lakes cannot support cold-water fish are projected to extend significantly further north under a 2xCO(2) climate scenario.

Breeding Bird Use and Wetland Characteristics of Diked and Undiked Coastal Marshes in Michigan	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Dikes were built on Great Lakes coastal wetlands to enable water level management for wetland wildlife, particularly waterfowl, but few studies have compared bird use of these areas to undiked sites. During 2005-2007, we evaluated 9 diked and 7 undiked coastal wetlands at the St. Clair Flats (Lake St. Clair) and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) of Michigan, USA. We compared bird use of diked and undiked wetlands via 605 10-minute point counts at randomly selected locations of emergent marsh and 287 45-minute surveys of randomly selected open water areas. We also measured wetland characteristics in 1,521 randomly selected 0.25-m(2) quadrats to compare vegetation and physical conditions between diked and undiked wetlands. Diked wetlands had greater coverage and density of cattail (Typha spp.), coverage of floating-leaved plants, water depth, and organic sediment depth compared to nearby undiked sites, whereas undiked wetlands had greater coverage and density of common reed (Phragmites australis) and bulrush (Schoenoplectus spp.) than diked wetlands. Bird species richness and similarity indices indicated comparable breeding bird communities. We observed greater abundances of Canada goose (Branta canadensis), wood duck (Aix sponsa), American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), and common gallinule (Gallinula galeata) in diked wetlands. These species likely responded to the deep-water cattail marsh and aquatic bed dominating most diked sites. American coot (Fulica americana), Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) abundance indices were greater in undiked wetlands, likely related to nesting and foraging habitat provided by the shallower, more open wetlands and connecting lakes. Diked wetlands did not benefit the bird community to the degree expected and conditions in diked areas were indicative of deep marshes with stabilized water levels. Periodic late-summer drawdowns could encourage growth of plants we found associated with greater abundance of some priority bird species and reduction of floating vegetation negatively associated with abundance of several species. However, effective control of invasive common reed is needed to reduce risk of expansion during impoundment dewatering.

Wherever mapped, Unit C is located between 6 and 30 in above modern wetlands, and includes thick sequences of diatomite and organic mats. The origin, depositional environment, and paleoclimatic significance of Unit C is controversial and currently under debate. Grosjean [Science 292 (2001) 2391a] suggests the unit developed under a regime of falling lake and ground-water levels, whereas evidence presented here suggests that Unit C formed during a period of rising ground-water levels and increased vegetation cover. The debate is embedded in broader discussions about geomorphic processes in ground-water-fed streams, as well as the history and forcing of climate variability in the central Andes. The central Atacama and Andes are remote, with few opportunities for different researchers to examine the same site. One exception is a sequence of mid-Holocene deposits at the confluence of Quebrada Seca and Rio Puripica in northern Chile (23degreesS). Grosjean et al. [Quat. Res. 48 (1997) 239-246] initially suggested the deposits accumulated in temporary lake basins, which formed when recurring debris flows from a side canyon (Quebrada Seca) dammed the main channel (Rio Puripica) during a period of drought and reduced stream flow. Upon our visit to the site, we found evidence that clearly demonstrates the deposits were not formed in temporary lakes, but rather were deposited in a wetland environment. Disagreement remains about the climatic interpretation of wetland deposits. Grosjean [Science 292 (2001) 2391a] now suggests that local ground-water levels rise and wetland deposits aggrade in deep canyon systems, such as Rio Puripica, when stream power and channel erosion is reduced during prolonged dry spells. However, sedimentological evidence and the presence of Unit C in many depositional environments, not just deep canyons, indicate that it formed during a period of higher regional ground-water levels that were sustained by enhanced precipitation and recharge in the High Andes.

For pre-hospital personnel, the main focus is to get the patient to the correct destination without unnecessary delay. For in-hospital personnel early information is vital to assess the possibility for resuscitation with extracorporeal re-warming. The challenge is augmented when rescuers must cross national borders to reach and/or deliver the patients. We present a case where three adolescent boys suffered severe hypothermia after a canoeing accident in Sweden. Case presentation: Three 14-year-old boys were canoeing a mountain lake close to the Norwegian border when their boat capsized and they all fell into the cold water. The rescue operation was hampered by rough weather conditions, and immersion times spanned from 63 to 125 min. Flight times from the scene of accident to the nearest ECMO center in Norway (Trondheim) and Sweden (Umea) were about 30 and 90 min respectively. Two of the victims showed no vital signs after retrieval from the water and had extremely low body temperatures. They were brought to Trondheim University Hospital where they were resuscitated successfully with extracorporeal re-warming. Unable to be weaned from ECMO in the initial phase, both patients were retrieved by mobile ECMO teams to Karolinska University Hospital, from where they were discharged to their homes with good outcomes, although with some sequelae. A third victim with moderate to severe hypothermia without cardiac arrest was treated at a local hospital, from where he after a short stay was discharged without physical sequelae. Conclusion: These cases are a reminder of the traditional mantra that "no one is dead until warm and dead". Good communication between pre-and in-hospital staff can be vital for optimizing patient treatment when handling victims of severe hypothermia, and especially when there is multiple victims. Communication between neighboring countries, but even neighboring regions within the same country, can be challenging. We encourage regions similar to ours to review protocols regarding hypothermia management, making them more robust before incidents like this take place.

J	Barinova, S; Gabyshev, V; Genkal, S				Barinova, Sophia; Gabyshev, Viktor; Genkal, Sergey			Diversity of Diatom Algae in the Lena Delta Nature Reserve and the Adjacent Territory in the Specific Ecological Factors of the Arctic	DIVERSITY-BASEL												A total of 413 diatom taxa were known for aquatic habitats of the Lena Delta Nature Reserve. We identified 385 taxa in 14 small tundra lakes near the reserve that significantly enriched the diatom diversity of the region (666 taxa including definitions to the genus level). Thus, the species composition of diatoms in the reserve and adjacent territories was increased by 278 species. We showed that the species of the genera Pinnularia (57) and Eunotia (51) have predominance at the family and generic levels. The index of intraspecific variability Ssp./Sp. for the lakes of the reserve was 1.11, and that for the lakes of the Tiksi region 1.14, which is typical for high-latitude and high-mountain communities. The number of rare or endangered species varied in different lakes from 1 to 10, totaling 42 species for the entire study area. Bioindication has shown that potentially threatened species prefer moderate temperatures, and slightly acidic or neutral environments free from organic pollution. A comparative analysis of the species composition of diatoms in the vicinity of the Lena Delta and other northern water bodies of Yakutia and the Arctic Islands showed that the species composition of each lake in the Arctic has a discernably different species distribution. The indicator characteristics show a certain response of the species composition of diatoms to changes in salinity, pH, and organic pollution. Regularities in the spatial distribution of diatoms in the study area were revealed in connection with the environmental variables of their habitat. Statistical mapping of diatom diversity data and bioindicators revealed a pronounced response to point pollution, and also let us assume the influence of summer northeast winds on species composition of the studied lake communities. We suggest that the high diversity inherent in the diatom lakes of the Tiksi coastal zone, which can even be updated in further studies, can be considered as a property of coastal biota inherent in ecotones. Since it is in the coastal Tiksi region that a surge in the number of species is observed, this region can be considered not only an ecotone, but also a hotspot of diatom diversity. The results of the study are important for developing the basis for monitoring biodiversity under the conditions of anthropogenic and climatic changes in the Arctic.

Using AMS C-14 and paleomagnetic data we present a first attempt in developing a reliable age model on macrotidal estuarine archives, with a decadal resolution. Correlations between sedimentary successions from the outer Seine estuary document the main sedimentary infilling phases of the system during the last 3000 years. Between 3000 and 1150 cal. BP sedimentary patterns reveal that sequence deposition and preservation are predominantly controlled by marine and tidal hydrodynamics while severe storm events are recorded at ca. 2700 and 1250 cal. BP in the outermost estuary. Conversely, the Medieval Warm Period (MWP: 900-1200 AD) is characterized by a drastic waning of the influence of marine hydrodynamics on sediment preservation. Pronounced episodes of Seine river floods indicate a much stronger impact of continental inputs on sedimentary patterns during this period. The onset of the Little Ice Age marks a diminishing influence of continental inputs while tidal and open marine hydrodynamics again exerted a primary control on the sedimentary evolution of the system during 1200-2003 AD. Coastal sedimentary dynamics as preserved within sedimentary successions appear to have been largely influenced by changes in storminess during the last 3000 years. We have matched the preservation of MWP Seine river floods, as revealed by sedimentological and rock magnetic proxy data, to a prolonged interval of weakened storminess in Normandy permitting the preservation of estuarine flood deposits within a context of reduced coastal erosion in northern Europe. The preservation of sedimentary successions in the Seine estuary is therefore maximal when climate conditions resembled those of the preferred low phase of the NAO on multidecadal timescales such as during 800-1200 AD (MWP). In contrast, increased removal and transport of estuarine sediments occur when winter storm activity greatly intensified over northwestern France. We report four prominent centennial-scale periods of stronger storminess, occurring with a pacing of similar to 1500 years, which are likely to be related to the last four Bond's Holocene cold events. Our results documenting a close link between coastal sedimentary dynamics, millennial-scale variations in Holocene climate and North Atlantic atmospheric circulation are fairly consistent with other records from Scandinavia, central Greenland and southern Europe.

The natural outflow of the take is by seepage, the lake level and the level of resurgence being similar to250 m: this value also corresponds approximately, to the maximum thickness of the lake deposits. Based oil the earlier extent of the lake beyond the town of Metztitlan, indicated in the "Relacion Geografica de Metztitlan" (A.D. 1579), the delta progradation rate of the Mwetztitlan River is estimated at 30 m/yr. Based on this rate and the maximum extent of the paleolake, the rock avalanche damming Laguna de Metztitlan most have occurred similar to500-1, 100 yr B.P. There are general observations that support a seismic origin of the rock avalanche. Two regional-scale, late Cenozoic, east-west striking and south-dipping normal faults at the northeastern margin of this rock avalanche feature. pronounced scarps, up to similar to250 at high. These faults have of same orientation as other normal faults with Quaternary activity farther west ill the stress and deformation province of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which is characterized by north-south oriented extension. Thick colluvium layers have been cut off and rotated along the northern fault. The southern fault forms a scarp with a height of 275-305 cm where it crosses the debris mound of the rock-avalanche, If which suggests the occurrence of a surface-rupturing earthquake on this fault in the past 1.100 yr.																			1026-8774						2004	21	3					397	411																WOS:000227240100007
J	Larsen, J; Bjune, AE; Caballero, ADR				Larsen, Jorunn; Bjune, Anne E.; Caballero, Arguitxu de la Riva			Holocene environmental and climate history of Trettetjorn, a low-alpine lake in Western Norway, based on subfossil pollen, diatoms, oribatid mites, and plant macrofossils	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Holocene lake and catchment environmental history and regional climate are reconstructed from lake sediments at Trettetjorn, a small lake situated close to the present-day treeline in western Norway. Sediments began to accumulate in the lake ca. 8575 (+/- 115) cal yr BP. Pollen-inferred mean July temperatures (T-jul) fluctuated below 12 degrees C with two cooler phases ca. 8400 and 8200 cal yr BP. The pollen-inferred annual precipitation (P-ann) was lowest during the early Holocene and varied around 1600 mm yr(-1). At the same time the highest diatom-inferred pH values (6.8) were reconstructed, probably due to input of base cations from the immature catchment soils. Betula pubescens became established around the lake ca. 8270 cal BP, soon followed by Pinus sylvestris. Maximum T-jul of ca. 12.5 degrees C occurred from 7760 to 5200 cal yr BP. The oribatid mite assemblages confirm the vegetation development from semiopen grassland to forest. Inferred T-jul was variable after 5200 cal yr BP and declined markedly around 4175 cal yr BP. At the same time more oceanic conditions are inferred with changes in the vegetation and mite assemblages suggesting the expansion of mires. After ca. 5000 cal yr BP and towards the present, the diatom concentration in the core becomes low and variable, thickness of the valves within the same taxon varies, and sometimes diatom frustules are completely absent from the sediment column. The diatom valve dissolution has affected both the diatom assemblages and the diatom-inferred pH up to the present-day. All proxies suggest that human impact affected the catchment after ca. 2000 cal yr BP followed by more intensive impact after ca. 1555 cal yr BP. The enlargement of the settlement at Upsete during the construction of the Bergen-Oslo railway (1894-1909 AD) is reflected by a charcoal peak and the presence of spheroidal carbonaceous particles coincides with a change in the diatom assemblages.

Efficacy of diquat treatments on Brazilian waterweed, effects on native macrophytes and water quality: A case study	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Brazilian waterweed (Egeria densa Planch) is an invasive aquatic plant that has spread to 27 countries and 39 states in the United States. Movement has been facilitated by its popularity as an aquarium plant. Once established, the plant can adversely alter ecosystems. Brazilian waterweed spreads solely by fragmentation, which suggests that it may be easier to control than plants with propagules such as seeds, tubers, and turions. Herbicides have the potential to offer targeted control; however, their use on Brazilian waterweed has yielded mixed results, and collateral damage to desirable native species is a concern. Fence Rock Lake is a 7-ha manmade impoundment in Guilford, CT, USA. Brazilian waterweed was first documented in small patches in 2009. By 2014, the plant covered most of the littoral zone, and diquat (6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrazine-5,8-diium dibromide) was applied by bottom injection at a rate of 1.8 kg active ingredient ha(-1). Control of Brazilian waterweed and effects on native species were assessed by the point intercept method. One year after treatment, in 2015, Brazilian waterweed was absent from all points except one. Another diquat treatment was performed in an effort to eradicate the plant from the lake. In 2016 and 2017, no Brazilian waterweed was found. The native plant community was resilient with an increase in species richness from 11 pretreatment to 18 two years posttreatment. Combined native species showed little change in frequency of occurrence. Frequency of occurrence of individual native species exhibited losses, gains, or little change depending on species. Bottom injected diquat concentrations remained low near the bottom and highest near the surface. No diquat was detected 10 days after treatment. Littoral zone dissolved oxygen fell to near, but not below, levels considered harmful to warm water fish. Transparency and total phosphorus were not substantially affected by the diquat treatment. This study confirms that Brazilian waterweed is highly controllable in a Connecticut lake with two successive yearly diquat treatments.

These blooms have affected several ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie to surrounding communities (notably drinking water quality). Several modeling efforts have identified the springtime total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) load as a major driver of maximum cyanobacterial biomass in western Lake Erie, and on this basis, international water management bodies have set a phosphorus (P) reduction goal. This P reduction goal is intended to reduce maximum cyanobacterial biomass, but there has been very limited effort to identify the specific locations within the western basin of Lake Erie that will likely experience the most benefits. Here, we used pixel-specific linear regression to identify where annual variation in spring TBP loads is most strongly associated with cyanobacterial abundance, as inferred from satellite imagery. Using this approach, we find that annual TBP loads are most strongly associated with cyanobacterial abundance in the central and southern areas of the western basin. At the location of the Toledo water intake, the association between TBP load and cyanobacterial abundance is moderate, and in Maumee Bay (near Toledo, Ohio), the association between TBP and cyanobacterial abundance is no better than a null model. Both of these locations are important for the delivery of specific ecosystem services, but this analysis indicates that P load reductions would not be expected to substantially improve maximum annual cyanobacterial abundance in these locations. These results are preliminary in the sense that only a limited set of models were tested in this analysis, but these results illustrate the importance of identifying whether the spatial distribution of management benefits (in this case P load reduction) matches the spatial distribution of management goals (reducing the effects of cyanobacteria on important ecosystem services).					; De Jager, Nathan/B-8470-2013	Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; Evans, Mary Anne/0000-0002-1627-7210; Wynne, Timothy/0000-0001-7282-0866													2045-7758					MAY	2020	10	9					3968	3976		10.1002/ece3.6160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6160		APR 2020						32489624					WOS:000526013100001
J	Eusterhues, K; Heinrichs, H; Schneider, JD				Eusterhues, K; Heinrichs, H; Schneider, JD			Geochemical response on redox fluctuations in Holocene lake sediments, Lake Steisslingen, Southern Germany	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Holocene sediments of Lake Steisslingen record sedimentation under different redox conditions. This is proven by the changing depth of the chemocline and the resulting varying extension of laminated sediments from the deepest part of the lake to shallower water depths. Redox fluctuations are additionally reflected by colour changes between red and green and the quality of the nonglacial varves. Major and trace elements were analysed on bulk sediment samples (period between 8200-6200 and 2650-2000 cal a BP) to test their response to the observed changes in past depositional environments. Mn, Mo, U, Fe and S were found to be redox-sensitive elements in Lake Steisslingen. Fe and S are almost entirely fixed in pyrite, because pyrite formation is limited by Fe availability. A parallel distribution of Me, U, Fe and S between 8200-7200 cal a BP is interpreted as a signal for syngenetic pyrite formation from anoxic and sulfidic hypolimnetic waters. Since bioproductivity was low this must have been caused by conditions favouring a longterm stable stratification of the lake (i.e. high water level, high summer temperatures, ice cover, wind protection and/or low storm activity). Between 6000-2000 cal a BP frequently changing redox conditions from anoxic to dysoxic are assumed. Mo and U curves are mirror images of the Fe, S and Mn variations. This is interpreted as showing diagenetic pyrite formation from pore waters, which is enhanced during times of high Fe availability under rather oxygenated conditions, i.e. when high input of Fe oxy-bydroxides is possible, but when U and Mo cannot necessarily be fixed in the sediments. Changes from slightly disturbed lamination (dysoxic, restricted mixis) to homogenous sediments (oxic conditions, holomixis) cannot be traced within the geochemical record. The observed redox fluctuations between 6000 and 2000 cal a BP are not correlated to changes in bioproductivity, detrital input or cultural influences and must therefore be of a natural, probably climatic origin. The North Atlantic Oscillation is discussed as a possible cause. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Our approach is based on established image analysis techniques modified for objects simultaneously stained with two fluorescent dyes. It allows the estimation of biomass and cell size distribution and the morphological characterization of different bacteriol taxa in plankton samples. The protocol was tested in a study of the bacterioplankton community of a high mountain lake during and after the ice break period. Cells that hybridized with a probe for the domain Bacteria accounted for 70% of the bacterial abundance (range, 49 to 83%) as determined by 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (K. G. Porter and Y. S. Feig, Limnol. Oceanogr. 25:943-948, 1980), but for >85% of the total biomass (range, 78 to 99%). The size distribution for members of the beta subclass of the Proteobacteria shifted toward larger cells and clearly distinguished this group from the total bacterial assemblage. In the surface water leger beneath the winter cover, bacteria belonging to the beta 1 subgroup constituted about one-half of the beta subclass abundance. The mean cell volume of the beta 1 subgroup bacteria was significantly less than that of the beta subclass proteobacteria, and the beta 1 subgroup accounted for less than 30% of the total beta subclass biovolume. Two weeks later, the biovolume of the beta Proteobacteria had decreased to the level of the beta 1 subgroup, and both the biovolume size distributions and cell morphologies of the beta Proteobacteria and the beta 1 subgroup were very similar. We could thus quantify the disappearance of large, morphologically distinct beta subclass protcobacteria which were not members of the beta 1 subgroup during the ice break period. Our results demonstrate that changes in biovolumes and cell size distributions of different bacterial taxa, and eventually of individual populations, reveal hitherto unknown processes within aquatic bacterial assemblages and may open new perspectives for the study of microbial food webs.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Alfreider, Albin/0000-0002-7644-7154; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761													0099-2240					DEC	1997	63	12					4778	4783		10.1128/AEM.63.12.4778-4783.1997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.63.12.4778-4783.1997								16535752					WOS:A1997YK70900023

Stoichiometric and growth responses of a freshwater filamentous green alga to varying nutrient supplies: slow and steady wins the race	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined how the nutrient stoichiometry of the filamentous green alga, Mougeotia sp., is affected by the relative availability of dissolved nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Using a bioassay experiment, we grew Mougeotia in medium having a range of dissolved N and P concentrations and N: P ratios (0.62 to 411 by mol). After growing Mougeotia in an environmental chamber for 17 days, we measured its carbon (C), N and P content (% of dry mass), molar C: N: P ratios, mass-specific growth rate (MSGR, day(-1)), chlorophyll a concentration (Chl, mu g L-1) and carbon: chlorophyll a (C: Chl) ratios. 2. Due largely to variation in cellular % N and % P, Mougeotia C: N: P ratios varied considerably at the end of the experiment, with C: N ratios ranging from 6 to 41, C: P ratios ranging from 85 to 999 and N: P ratios ranging from 4 to 118. We found Mougeotia to be weakly homeostatic with respect to N: P content, with non-homeostatic tendencies found for N content and P content. Despite the wide range of N and P concentrations in the medium at the start of the experiment, Mougeotia MSGR was relatively invariant. Nevertheless, high C: Chl ratios observed for N- and P-limited Mougeotia largely matched those expected for algae experiencing nutrient-limited growth. 3. We further compared our experimental results with stoichiometric data for Mougeotia collected from the Kawartha Lakes in southern Ontario. The high C: P and N: P ratios found in field samples matched those of laboratory Mougeotia experiencing intense and sustained P limitation and are suggestive of severe P limitation of Mougeotia in Kawartha Lakes throughout the summer. 4. The slow growth rates and flexible stoichiometry of this alga would enable it to continue growing even during periods of acute nutrient stress. Hence, future management and control of this nuisance alga may prove difficult if it is unlikely to respond strongly to reductions in external P loading and lower water column P concentrations.

Particle-size evidence of barrier estuary regime as a new proxy for ENSO climate variability	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												We investigate a new proxy for ENSO climate variability based on particle-size data from long-term, coastal sediment records preserved in a barrier estuary setting. Corresponding similar to 4-8 year periodicities identified from Wavelet analysis of particle-size data from Pescadero Marsh in Central Coast California and rainfall data from San Francisco reflect established ENSO periodicity, as further evidenced in the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), and thus confirms an important ENSO control on both precipitation and barrier regime variability. Despite the fact that barrier estuary mean particle size is influenced by coastal erosion, precipitation and streamflow, balanced against barrier morphology and volume, it is encouraging that considerable correspondence can also be observed in the time series of MEI, regional rainfall and site-based mean particle size over the period 1871-2008. This correspondence is, however, weakened after c. 1970 by temporal variation in sedimentation rate and event-based deposition. These confounding effects are more likely when: (i) accommodation space may be a limiting factor; and (ii) particularly strong El Nins,e.g. 1982/1983 and 1997/1998, deposit discrete > cm-thick units during winter storms. The efficacy of the sediment record of climate variability appears not to be compromised by location within the back-barrier setting, but it is limited to those El Ninos that lead to barrier breakdown. For wider application of this particle size index of ENSO variability, it is important to establish a well-resolved chronology and to sample the record at the appropriate interval to characterize deposition at a sub-annual scale. Further, the sample site must be selected to limit the influence of decreasing accommodation space through time (infilling) and event-based deposition. It is concluded that particle-size data from back-barrier sediment records have proven potential for preserving evidence of sub-decadal climate variability, allowing researchers to explore temporal and spatial patterns in phenomena such as ENSO.

J	Deibert, JE; Camilleri, PA				Deibert, JE; Camilleri, PA			Sedimentologic and tectonic origin of an incised-valley-fill sequence along an extensional marginal-lacustrine system in the Basin and Range province, United States: Implications for predictive models of the location of incised valleys	AAPG BULLETIN												Incised valleys in extensional lacustrine systems should be common and significant petroleum targets, yet documentation and analysis of these systems are limited and, hence, so are predictive models for their location. Geologic mapping of the Miocene-Pliocene Humboldt Formation in Knoll basin, northeastern Nevada, has revealed a significant incised-valley system formed along the lacustrine margins of an extensional basin. The valley formed during a relative lake-level fall and incised into lacustrine shoreface and offshore sandstone and subsequently was filled with fluvial and eolian sediment as lake level rose. The valley's location was tectonically influenced; it is situated in the hinge zone of a syncline near the tip of the range-bounding fault system. Folding of the syncline was broadly synchronous with incision and filling, and it appears to have localized the valley along the topographically low hinge zone. Furthermore, the large relative lake-level change that produced the valley is only recorded in strata in the syncline area, suggesting that the location and cause of incision was greatly influenced by tectonics. Thus, the location of similar incised valleys in other extensional basins may be predictable if comparable tectonic features and processes are recognized. Our study suggests that the best locations to develop and preserve incised valleys are near the tips of normal faults during periods of overall high tectonic subsidence. Specific areas along basin-bounding faults where tectonically influenced incised valleys are more likely to form include fault-propagation folds, synthetic relay ramps near transfer faults, and areas that have large changes in fault slip. Although lake volume changes caused predominantly by climate change can be an important factor in producing incised valleys, tectonically influenced incised valleys are likely to be larger, better preserved, and more petroleum prone compared to climate-controlled incised valleys.																			0149-1423	1558-9153				FEB	2006	90	2					209	235		10.1306/09140505028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/09140505028													WOS:000235325400004

Population, community, and ecosystem-level properties were studied in laboratory stream channels that had nutrient inputs reduced compared to channels where ambient nutrient levels were maintained. We reduced nutrient inputs in four of eight channels by recirculating 90% of the flow, whereas the other four channels received once-through flow of spring water. We examined the interaction between herbivory and nutrients by varying the number of snails (Elimia clavaeformis) among streams with different nutrient input (circulation) regimes. Reduction in nutrient input via recirculation resulted in lower concentrations of nutrients in the water but did not result in significant differences in biomass, carbon fixation, or algal taxonomic composition. However, herbivory had large effects on these characteristics by reducing biomass and areal rates of carbon fixation and simplifying periphyton taxonomy and physiognomy. Lower rates of nutrient input significantly affected characteristics associated with nutrient cycling. Streams with reduced nutrient inputs had lower periphyton nutrient contents, higher ratios of total: net uptake of P from water, and higher rates of phosphatase activity than streams with ambient nutrient inputs. However, the effects of reduced nutrient input on cycling characteristics were reduced or eliminated by intense herbivory. Our results indicate that nutrient cycling can increase in response to reductions in nutrient input once sufficient biomass or detritus accumulates to facilitate cycling, thereby allowing biomass accrual and carbon fixation rates to be maintained at levels achieved at higher nutrient inputs. In streams with low nutrient input, cycling can meet a large fraction of the nutrient demand of the periphyton. Because our experimental design involved a reduction from ambient nutrient levels rather than the usual enrichment tecnhiques (e.g., additions to water, nutrient-diffusing substrates) in aquatic ecosystems, we have been able to observe how biological structure and processes are influenced by external nutrient inputs at the low natural levels of most undisturbed streams.

J	Birks, HH				Birks, Hilary H.			South to north: Contrasting late-glacial and early-Holocene climate changes and vegetation responses between south and north Norway	HOLOCENE												Norway shows south-north climate and vegetation gradients today. Were there similar gradients during the late-glacial and early Holocene, 14,700-9000 years ago? A comparison was made along a south-north transect in Norway of plant-macrofossil reconstructions of past vegetation changes and independent summer temperature records derived from parallel chironomid data (C-Tjul). Three lake sites were selected with sediment cores with good chronological control. The importance of soil moisture is reflected by the reconstructed vegetation in relation to the temperature regime. Besides climate drivers, how important were intrinsic succession and competition in influencing vegetation patterns? Were migration delays significant, why and by how much? Oceanic climate in the late-glacial in south-west Norway resulted in snow-bed vegetation and glacier development in the Younger Dryas (YD). In contrast, the north was arid and continental, even into the early Holocene. Overall, temperatures were about 2 degrees C colder than in the south. The YD impact differed markedly between south and north Norway. In the south, cooling at c. 12,700 cal. yr BP was swift and marked by strong responses. In the north, there was no impact at the chronological start of the YD, but cooling occurred later about 12,450 cal. yr BP together with increased aridity. During the early Holocene, temperature and oceanicity increased progressively northwards as the North Atlantic Current became established. Birch woodland developed in the south about 660 years after the start of the Holocene, after about 1000 years on AndOya, and after about 1450 years in northernmost Norway. However, the 590 year lag in the south after C-Tjul reached 11 degrees C, the limiting temperature for tree-birch growth, decreased to 400 years in the north, as the birch tree-line kept pace with temperature rise. In the far north, a thermal maximum of 1 degrees C above today's mean July temperature and parallel vegetation development were recorded from 10,100 to 9370 cal. yr BP. On AndOya, temperatures exceeded present values by 1 degrees C after 9700 cal. yr BP. There was no detectable period of above modern temperatures further south before 9000 cal. yr BP.

J	Larson, GL; Buktenica, MW				Larson, GL; Buktenica, MW			Variability of Secchi disk readings in an exceptionally clear and deep caldera lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The variability of Secchi disk readings was explored in Crater Lake, an exceptionally clear and deep subalpine caldera lake. The primary objective was to document summer monthly and annual variability in Secchi disk readings, and variation caused by observers, disk size, and surface condition of the lake. An additional objective was to determine differences between descending and ascending disk readings (the averages of the two readings representing the disk readings) relative to the depth of the Secchi disk readings, lake surface conditions, and disk size. Secchi disk data were collected from June through September, 1978-1995. Secchi disk depths typically were in the high 20- to low 30-m range. Secchi disk readings were deepest in June and shallowest in August. Average monthly disk readings exhibited considerable variation among years (9.4 m in June, 13.4 m in July, 13.0 m in August, and 8.2 m in September). On average, variation in Secchi disk readings among observers was Im or less. When the lake surface was calm and skies were clear or had high haze, differences between descending and ascending observations decreased slightly with increased disk depth. Waves from tour boats, drips of water from the research vessel, and wind generated ripples and chop decreased disk readings as much as 5 m relative to readings recorded when the lake surface was calm. Clarity readings using a 100-cm disk were 7.0 m deeper than were 20-cm disk readings. Documentation of the extensive variation in Secchi disk clarity is needed to determine "normal" conditions and to judge the long-term status and trends of lake clarity. Furthermore, documenting the variation caused by slightly disturbed lake surface conditions relative to calm surface conditions and among trained observers ensures consistent interpretation of the long-term data base.																			0003-9136					MAR	1998	141	4					377	388																WOS:000072984200001

Processes occurring on such floodplains are often difficult to observe, and techniques used to investigate smaller perennial floodplains are often not practical in these environments. This study assesses the utility of Cs-137 inventory and depth-profile techniques for determining relative amounts of floodplain sedimentation in the Fitzroy River, northeastern Australia; a 143 000 km(2) semi-arid river system. Caesium-137 inventories were calculated for floodplain and reference location bulk soil cores collected from four sites. Depth profiles of Cs-137 concentration from each floodplain site and a reference location were recorded. The areal density of Cs-137 at reference locations ranged from 13 to 978 Bq m(-2) (0-1367 Bq m(-2) at the 950% confidence interval), and the mean value +/- 2 (standard error of the mean) was 436 264 Bq m(-2), similar to published data from other Southern Hemisphere locations. Floodplain inventories ranged from 68 to 1142 Bq m(-2) (0-1692 Bq m(-2) at the 95% confidence interval), essentially falling within the range of reference inventory values, thus preventing calculation of erosion or deposition. Depth-profiles of Cs-137 concentration indicate erosion at one site and over 66 cm of deposition at another since 1954. Analysis Of Pu239+240 concentrations in a depositional core substantiated the interpretation made from Cs-137 data, and depict a more tightly constrained peak in concentration. Average annual deposition rates range from 0 to 15 mm. The similarity between floodplain and reference bulk inventories does not necessarily indicate a lack of erosion or deposition, due to low Cs-137 fallout in the region and associated high measurement uncertainties, and a likely influence of gully and bank eroded sediments with no or limited adsorbed Cs-137. in this low-fallout environment, detailed depth-profile data are necessary for investigating sedimentation using Cs-137.

J	Mouthon, J; Magny, M				Mouthon, Jacques; Magny, Michel			Unprecedented changes in mollusc assemblages of the littoral zone in the two largest peri-Alpine French lakes since the last 4500 years	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This paper presents changes in mollusc assemblages in the two largest peri-Alpine French lakes, i.e. Lakes Bourget and Annecy, in eastern France during the late Holocene. It is based on new mollusc data obtained in Lake Bourget: i) from three sediment cores spanning the late Holocene period; and ii) from modern samples taken around 1930 and in 2001. These new results are compared with those obtained from the neighbouring Lake Annecy and published in a previous paper. Results show that the modern period is characterised by unprecedented changes in the mollusc assemblages in Lakes Bourget and Annecy over the last 4500 years. The main drivers of the observed changes may be related to: i) the recent arrival of native and exotic species; ii) the considerable regression of lacustrine macrophytes following increased anthropic pressure on these ecosystems from the 1940s onwards; and iii) modifications of the nature and quality of the fine littoral sediments of Lake Bourget, probably linked to the regulation of its water level. In addition, the arrival of new species has led to the creation of no-analogue communities, i. e. which consist of species that are extant today, but in combinations not found until now. As a result, a return to the initial state in terms of community structures is thus difficult to envisage. On the contrary, re-establishing the dominance of charophytes and thus the dominance of gastropods, characteristic of the littoral malacocenoses of the Holocene, is a conceivable objective. Nonetheless, the persistence and extension of the period of hypoxic hypolimnion associated with warmer winters expected in the northern hemisphere could affect the recovery process negatively.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	1					36	46		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.819	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.819													WOS:000338928300004

Landslide and tsunami hazard at Yate volcano, Chile as an example of edifice destruction on strike-slip fault zones	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The edifice of Yate volcano, a dissected stratocone in the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, has experienced multiple summit collapses throughout postglacial time restricted to sectors NE and SW of the summit. The largest such historic event occurred on 19th February 1965 when similar to 6.1-10 x 10(6) m(3) of rock and ice detached from 2,000-m elevation to the SW of the summit and transformed into a debris flow. In the upper part of the flow path, velocities are estimated to have reached 40 m s(-1). After travelling 7,500 m and descending 1,490 m, the flow entered an intermontane lake, Lago Cabrera. A wavemaker of estimated volume 9 +/- 3 x 10(6) m(3) generated a tsunami with an estimated amplitude of 25 m and a run-up of similar to 60 m at the west end of the lake where a settlement disappeared with the loss of 27 lives. The landslide followed 15 days of unusually heavy summer rain, which may have caused failure by increasing pore water pressure in rock mechanically weathered through glacial action. The preferential collapse directions at Yate result from the volcano's construction on the dextral strike-slip Liquie-Ofqui fault zone. Movement on the fault during the lifetime of the volcano is thought to have generated internal instabilities in the observed failure orientations, at similar to 10A degrees to the fault zone in the Riedel shear direction. This mechanically weakened rock may have led to preferentially orientated glacial valleys, generating a feedback mechanism with collapse followed by rapid glacial erosion, accelerating the rate of incision into the edifice through repeated landslides. Debris flows with magnitudes similar to the 1965 event are likely to recur at Yate, with repeat times of the order of 10(2) years. With a warming climate, increased glacial meltwater due to snowline retreat and increasing rain, at the expense of snow, may accelerate rates of edifice collapse, with implications for landslide hazard and risk at glaciated volcanoes, in particular those in strike-slip tectonic settings where orientated structural instabilities may exist.

J	Konstantinou, IK; Goutner, V; Albanis, TA				Konstantinou, IK; Goutner, V; Albanis, TA			The incidence of polychlorinated biphenyl and organochlorine pesticide residues in the eggs of the cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis):: an evaluation of the situation in four Greek wetlands of international importance	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study contributed to identifying the current levels of organochlorine pollutants in four Creek wetlands of international importance (the Evros and Aries Deltas, and Kerkini and Prespa Lakes), using the cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis as a suitable bioindicator in a region where such information is scarce. Residue levels of eight polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 13 organochlorine pesticide (OC) compounds were measured in cormorant eggs. Most PCBs and OCs (except dieldrin and endrin) were found in at least some of the study areas. Median concentrations of five PCBs (IUPAC 8, 20, 52, 138, 180) and of six OCs (alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, lindane, heptachlor, 4,4'-DDE and 4,4'-DDT) differed significantly among the areas. The median totals of the PCBs were highly significant among the areas, being unexpectedly highest in Prespa Lake (68.43 ppb), despite its remoteness, and lowest in Evros Delta samples (12.17 ppb). Aldrin that was found in samples from Evros, Aries and Prespa probably accumulated in wintering grounds. In all of the areas, the relative proportions of alpha-BHC and 2,4'-DDD were the highest of all OCs. Fingerprint and cluster analyses illustrated overall differences in the PCB patterns, being greatest between the deltas than between the lakes, but, inversely, for OCs the differences were smaller in the deltas. Differences were attributed to targe variations in the cormorants' diet between areas and different regimes of pollutant management in the two types of wetland. Correlations of pollutants varied considerably among areas and they were more diverse in OCs. The Sigma OCs/Sigma PCBs ratio indicates agrochemical pollution in all areas. An important finding was that levels of both pollutant groups were too low to have any biological implications on the cormorants and, additionally, suggest that they have a negligible impact on the environment of the wetlands studied.

This is important since the effects of human land-use changes (e.g. agriculture, deforestation and afforestation/reforestation) on biodiversity and climate are still under debate. Over the last decade, development, validation, and application of pollen-vegetation relationship models have made it possible to estimate plant abundance from fossil pollen data at both local and regional scales. In particular, the REVEALS model has been applied to produce datasets of past regional plant cover at 1 degrees spatial resolution at large subcontinental scales (North America, Europe, and China). However, such reconstructions are spatially discontinuous due to the discrete and irregular geographical distribution of sites (lakes and peat bogs) from which fossil pollen records have been produced. Therefore, spatial statistical models have been developed to create continuous maps of past plant cover using the REVEALS-based land cover estimates. In this paper, we present the first continuous time series of spatially complete maps of past plant cover across Europe during the Holocene (25 time windows covering the period from 11.7 k BP to present). We use a spatial-statistical model for compositional data to interpolate REVEALS-based estimates of three major land-cover types (LCTs), i.e., evergreen trees, summer-green trees and open land (grasses, herbs and low shrubs); producing spatially complete maps of the past coverage of these three LCTs. The spatial model uses four auxiliary data sets-latitude, longitude, elevation, and independent scenarios of past anthropogenic land-cover change based on per-capita land-use estimates ("standard" KK10 scenarios)-to improve model performance for areas with complex topography or few observations. We evaluate the resulting reconstructions for selected time windows using present day maps from the European Forest Institute, cross validate, and compare the results with earlier pollen-based spatially-continuous estimates for five selected time windows, i.e., 100 BP-present, 350-100 BP, 700-350 BP, 3.2-2.7 k BP, and 6.2-5.7 k BP. The evaluations suggest that the statistical model provides robust spatial reconstructions. From the maps we observe the broad change in the land-cover of Europe from dominance of naturally open land and persisting remnants of continental ice in the Early Holocene to a high fraction of forest cover in the Mid Holocene, and anthropogenic deforestation in the Late Holocene. The temporal and spatial continuity is relevant for land-use, land-cover, and climate research.					; Woodbridge, Jessie/ABH-9023-2020; Gaillard, Marie-José/ABG-2680-2021; Poska, Anneli/O-7358-2015; Githumbi, Esther/ABH-8329-2020; Nielsen, Anne/H-3996-2011	/0000-0002-5676-008X; Pirzamanbein, Behnaz/0000-0002-8245-4107; Nielsen, Anne Birgitte/0000-0001-7854-353X; Lindstrom, Johan/0000-0001-9392-6053													2296-701X					FEB 24	2022	10								795794	10.3389/fevo.2022.795794	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.795794													WOS:000770574800001
J	THOMAS, MLH; EAKINS, KE; LOGAN, A				THOMAS, MLH; EAKINS, KE; LOGAN, A			PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANCHIALINE PONDS OF BERMUDA	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												There are five anchialine ponds in Bermuda of 0.5 ha or over, the largest being Mangrove Lake with an area of 12 ha. Volumes vary from 4,550 to 164,418 m3 and tidal flushing from 0.56% to 62.8%. The deepest, Walsingham Pond, has maximum and mean depths of 6.2 and 3.9 m respectively. Connections between the ponds and the sea vary from small fissures to small caves, which in all but one, Lovers Lake, connect at the surface of the pond. Mean salinities are all close to open sea water values, but in ponds with low flushing and in Lovers Lake, surface values are somewhat reduced, the lowest being 27.4 parts-per-thousand in Trotts Pond. Mean pond water temperatures were all very similar at about 24-degrees-C, but ranges were highly variable. Dissolved oxygen values in ponds in which they were studied in detail were quite variable, especially in summer, ranging from supersaturation to close to zero and it is possible that anoxic conditions occur occasionally. Light levels were studied in Walsingham Pond; there bottom irradiance levels exceeded 20% of surface values. All other ponds are much shallower and well illuminated. The sediments showed high organic content inversely related to tidal flushing, ranging from a mean of 42% in Mangrove Lake to 8% in Lovers Lake. The inorganic fraction of sediments was silt-clay mixed with, or overlying, a shell gravel. The percent silt-clay, varying between 67 and 32%, was also inversely related to tidal flushing. The shell gravels varied in composition from pond to pond but all had the gastropod Cerithium lutosum in abundance. Although many of the shell components reflected the abundance of living molluscs in the ponds, there were also significant quantities of relict species which are not presently living there. It is concluded that some species go through large population cycles at relatively long intervals.																			0007-4977					JAN	1991	48	1					125	136																WOS:A1991FC80700008

Evaluation of some pollutant levels in environmental samples collected from the area of the new campus of Taif University	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												The levels of radioactivity and heavy metals in soil, plant and groundwater samples collected from the area of the new campus of Taif University, Saudi Arabia, and its neighbouring areas have been determined. High-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy was used for radioactivity measurements, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was used to determine the concentration of heavy metals. The means of 226Ra, 228Ra and 40K concentrations in water samples collected from four wells were found to be 0.13 +/- 0.03, 0.05 +/- 0.03 and 1.3 +/- 0.5Bql1, respectively. The means of 238U, 226Ra, 228Ra (232Th for soil samples) and 40K concentrations in wild plant and soil samples were found to be 3.7 +/- 4.1, 8.8 +/- 11.6, 3.8 +/- 2.9 and 1025 +/- 685, and 8.6 +/- 3.4, 12.8 +/- 3.4, 16.6 +/- 7.1 and 618 +/- 82Bqkg1 dry weight (DW), respectively. The 137Cs of artificial origin was also detected in soil samples with a mean concentration of 3.8 +/- 2.2Bqkg1 DW. Evaluating the results, it can be concluded that the concentrations of 238U, 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in soil samples fall within the world average. Furthermore, 19 trace and major elements in groundwater samples and 22 elements in soil and plant samples were determined. The sampling locations of soil can be classified into three groups (relatively high, medium and low polluted) according to their calculated metal pollution index using the contents of trace and major elements. A cluster analysis of the contents of radioactivity and trace element contents in soil samples shows the presence of two main distinct clusters of sampling locations.

Walleye Management in the Red Lakes, Minnesota: Collapse, Recovery, and Cooperative Management	FROM CATASTROPHE TO RECOVERY: STORIES OF FISHERY MANAGEMENT SUCCESS												Fishery management jurisdiction of the Red Lakes is split between the state of Minnesota and Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians. Historically, the Red Lakes supported productive commercial and recreational Walleye Sander vitreus fisheries before crashing in the 1990s from decades of overharvest. In the late 1990s, these management groups began an interagency effort to develop and implement a recovery plan to restore the Walleye population, which included a complete Walleye fishing moratorium with strict enforcement and a short-term fry stocking program. Public involvement occurred early in the planning stages and throughout the implementation process. Public support was essential for effective implementation of restrictive fishing regulations necessary to expedite recovery and to resume harvests. The combination of recovery stockings and a 7-year Walleye fishing moratorium by both jurisdictions was successful, and the Walleye population recovered sufficiently to resume harvest in 2006. Walleye harvest was guided by a jointly prepared "Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks" (hereafter, "Harvest Plan"; Red Lakes Fisheries Technical Committee, 2006 Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks, unpublished), which took a conservative approach to harvest management while the Walleye population progressed towards full recovery as defined in the "Recovery Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks" (MOU 1999). The Walleye population reached full recovery thresholds in 2009, and the Harvest Plan was revised in 2015 to allow increased harvest after observing negative density dependent effects on growth and recruitment. Current management focuses on active management of spawning stock biomass for optimal condition as defined by the revised Harvest Plan (2.5-4.5 lb/surface acre [2.8-5.0 kg/ha]; Red Lakes Fisheries Technical Committee, 2015 Harvest Plan for Red Lakes Walleye Stocks, unpublished). This approach strives to manage spawning stock biomass such that wild fry production falls within the optimal range of a density dependent stock recruitment relationship, and to maximize the likelihood of producing strong year-classes to support harvest levels commensurate with the potential productivity of the system. The collapse of the Red Lakes' Walleye fisheries was catastrophic but provided an incredible opportunity to increase our understanding of Walleye population dynamics, the importance of collaborative fishery management, and public involvement in decision-making processes.																					978-1-934874-55-4				2019							323	352																WOS:000488863700014

Impact of flood on distribution of bathypelagic perch fry layer along the longitudinal profile of large canyon-shaped reservoir	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Previous studies have shown that under normal spring conditions, the layer of bathypelagic perch Perca fluviatilis fry (BPF) is equally distributed along most of the longitudinal profile of reservoirs. In the first half of June 2004, local flooding entering the large canyon-shaped Orlik Reservoir (Czech Republic) completely flushed out the existing fry community from the 31 km long riverine part of the reservoir. The pelagic zone in this reach was then recolonized by cyprinid (mainly roach Rutilus rutilus and bream Abramis brama) fry being of either littoral or riverine origin. Subsequently, the BPF layer was recorded only in the 22 km long lacustrine part of the reservoir. In the upper reach of this part where, due to the sudden increase in volume, the water current slowed down rapidly and fry originating from both riverine and central parts of the reservoir gathered in high numbers, two distinct BPF layers were observed. During mid-day, the upper BPF layer, created predominantly by shoaling fishes (abundance > 126 000 individuals ha(-1)), occurred between 6 and 10 m. A second, lower BPF layer, created by non-shoaling fishes exclusively (30 000 individuals ha(-1)), was recorded between 12 and 17 m depth. Both upper and lower BPF layer were composed of perch (69.6 and 66.8% in abundance respectively) and zander Sander lucioperca (29.8 and 28.6% in abundance respectively). In the lower BPF layer, ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus also contributed considerably to the fry assemblage (4.0% in abundance). Perch from the upper BPF layer (mean 25.1 mm total length, L-T) did not differ in size from perch from the lower BPF layer (mean 25.0 mm L-T). Similarly, zander from the upper BPF layer (mean 27.2 mm L-T) were almost the same size as those from the lower BPF layer (mean 26.9 mm L-T). Perch from both BPF layers, however, were noticeably smaller than zander. The results from acoustic survey and complementary net catches suggest that no epipelagic perch fry were found in the reservoir where thermal stratification had been destroyed by flooding and windy weather.

J	Gillies, JA; Nickling, WG; Tilson, M				Gillies, John A.; Nickling, William G.; Tilson, Michael			Ventifacts and wind-abraded rock features in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica	GEOMORPHOLOGY												An area north of Lake Fryxell in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica, was surveyed to determine the frequency of occurrence of rocks that show strong evidence of wind abrasion and ventifaction, which is defined here as rocks having well-developed faceting, to define their relative abundance in this area of the ice-free McMurdo Dry Valley system and to provide an indication of the role of wind as a geomorphic agent in this area. The orientation of abrasion-caused features (facets. keels, and grooves) with respect to the present day wind regime is also described. Rocks were examined on five linear transects ranging from 300 to 510 m in length. A total of 1324 rocks were examined. On average, 60% of all rocks exhibited distinct wind abrasion features with polish being the most common feature and polished rocks were distributed equally between survey lines, suggesting abrasion was ubiquitous in the study area. Approximately 4% of the rocks had distinct facets and/or keels, and fine-grained ultramafic peridotite-type rocks produced the most finely-featured forms (i.e., sharp facet edges and keels). A larger percentage, approximate to 12.5%, had grooves. Grooves were typically associated with a tabular form of mafic diabase-type igneous rock. The distribution of faceted ventifacts and grooved rocks was not uniform for the five transects, suggesting that the distribution mechanism for the surface rocks and the source areas determined, to a large extent, what form of ventifact could be produced at a location. The orientation of the grooves and dip directions of the facets indicates the direction of the abrasive winds had a strong westerly component, which coincides with the modern wind regime of winter katabatic flows that move down valley toward the Ross Sea. The orientation of the facets and grooves suggests that the rate of formation of the ventifacts proceeds at a pace greater than other surficial processes (e.g., down-slope soil movement, cryoturbation), which should tend to remove trends in the facet and groove orientations, or that the down-slope movement of the surface is approximately perpendicular to the wind allowing preservation of the alignment.

It is also the main river draining the Far-North of Cameroon. Like other parts of the watershed, this region experienced several catastrophic floods in the three last decades. This article examines the dynamics of hydrological extremes, and therefore droughts and floods, from Logone and Chari at the stations of Bongor and N'Djamena, taking into account the context of climate change. The analyzes are based on the maximum (Q(max)) and minimum (Q(min)) daily flow for the period 1955-2016. XLStat and KhronoStat softwares made it possible to calculate a set of indices (irregularity index, drying coefficient, coefficient A of MYER). This software was also used to determine trends in the evolution of data over time. The flows of Logone and Chari allow to highlight successive hydro-climatic conditions in the Sahelian zone of Cameroon over the study period. The Q(max) showed a break in 1971-72 at Bongor and 1972-73 at N'Djamena. This result shows the transition from wet conditions to a marked drought. In Bongor, the Q(min) experienced three successive breaks, in 1971-72, 1998-99 and 2010-11. In N'Djamena, on the other hand, only one break occurred in 1982-83, with a fall in values of 55 %. From 2000, conditions became particularly contrasted, especially in Bongor, with alternating years with very different flows. On average, the coefficient A of MYER is 6.5 in Bongor and 3.2 in N'Djamena. This reflects the low power of floods. The annual value of the Q(max)/Q(min) ratio gradually decreased in Bongor, while it increased in N'Djamena. The drying coefficient of MAILLET is generally low (0.019/day on average); 6 months may elapse between the occurrence of Q(max) and that of Q(min). Only 23 % of catastrophic floods registered in the study area occurred during wet years. This shows the important role played by other factors, such the spatial distribution of rainfall.

However, pollution, mosquito management, increased use of water and drainage of wetland areas for agriculture and building, led to the loss of many of the original wetlands. On the other hand, persistent water shortages have led to the construction of more than 100 dams on the island. In this study, the biodiversity of two natural wetlands, Ronnas River and Oroklini Lake, was compared to that of two man-made wetlands, Gecitkoy (Panagra) Reservoir and Achna Dam. Baseline ecological surveys of plants, invertebrates and birds were carried out at bi-monthly intervals from February to June 2006. In total, 495 plant species, out of which 22 were endemic, were recorded with Gecitkoy (Panagra) Dam showing the highest plant diversity and Oroklini Lake the lowest. A total of 13 invertebrate orders were recorded, however, no statistical difference was found between the number of orders in artificial and natural wetlands. Furthermore, 18 butterfly species were recorded, with the highest diversity found at Ronnas River on Centaurea sp., Onopordum cyprium, Pistachia sp. and Cistus creticus. Less diversity found at Oroklini Lake and Achna Dam was due to an absence of maquis vegetation in these areas. Moreover, the highest butterfly diversity in all wetlands was observed in February and April, following winter rainfall in February, and increasing temperatures in April. Lower insect numbers and diversity in May were due to windy conditions. A total of 83 bird species were identified, with 32 recorded at Ronnas River, 29 at Oroklini Lake, 25 at Gecitkoy (Panagra) Reservoir and 35 at Achna Dam. Most individuals were counted at Achna Dam (1493) and the least at Ronnas River (217). At Oroklini, Gecitkoy and Achna, the most abundant species was the Common Coot while most species recorded at Ronnas were terrestrial, with the Common Wood-pigeon being the most abundant species. However the outcome so far is that there is little difference between these two wetlands types in terms of biodiversity richness. This study has demonstrated that artificial wetlands do provide important habitats for flora and fauna and these sites should be managed with biodiversity as well as water resources.

J	Thomas, JD				Thomas, JD			The role of dissolved organic matter, particularly free amino acids and humic substances, in freshwater ecosystems	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Although the mass of dissolved organic matter (DOM) often exceeds that of living organisms in freshwaters, little is known about the roles of its constituent molecules as sources of energy and information for aquatic organisms. In the present review attention is focused on free amino acids (FAA) and humic substances (HS) as examples of labile and refractory components within DOM. 2. The following questions are addressed. (i) What are spatiotemporal patterns in the distribution of DOM, HS and FAA? (ii) What are the origins of the components of DOM and how are their concentrations regulated? (iii) What is the significance of the spatial and temporal distributional patterns of DOM, HS and FAA to detritivorous invertebrates and other organisms associated with them? (iv) What is the relevance of DOM to the food web concept and to the biochemical ecology of freshwater ecosystems? 3. Concentrations of DOM, FAA and HS within lentic ecosystems are ranked as follows: Sediment pore water > Air-water interface > Midwater column. Comparisons between water bodies show that the concentrations of labile constituents of DOM, such as FAA, are usually positively correlated with base cations, nutrients and biological activity. In contrast, HS concentrations are negatively correlated with base cations or nutrients but positively correlated with the rate of biological degradation (the maximum values occurring in the autumn). The FAA:HS ratios might serve therefore as an indicator of the potential productivity of a water body. 4. External sources of DOM in general, and FAA and HS in particular, include rainwater, windborne material, surface flow and groundwater. The relative importance of these allochthonous sources of DOM decreases along the length of lotic ecosystems and also with increase in size of lentis ecosystems. Internal sources of FAA and HS include synthesis or polymerization from existing organic matter, degradation of organic matter and release from both living and dead organisms. The net accumulation of DOM released by living bacteria, phytoplankton, epilithon, macrophytes and invertebrates is much reduced due to heterotrophic uptake. Hence, most of the allochthonous DOM in freshwater originates from dead organic matter deposited on the sediment. Phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems may, however, differ, as most of their DOM may be recycled within the water column. 5. The factors that determine the external concentrations of DOM, FAA and HS are discussed. Evidence is cited in support of the following testable hypotheses. (i) The rates of production of DOM components will be favoured by increasing base cation and nutrient concentrations. (ii) Colloidal clay, base cations, biopolymers and living organisms, particularly bacteria, facilitate the removal of HS. Consequently, base-rich eutrophic waters tend to have lower HS concentrations than oligotrophic, base-deficient waters. (iii) As a result of higher productivity and selective removal of FAA, eutrophic waters tend to have higher FAA concentrations than those that are oligotrophic. 6. Labile DOM components, such as FAA, act as sources of information for aquatic organisms. More research is needed in this field. There is a consensus that DOM acts as an important source of energy for aquatic bacteria, thus forming the microbial leap. However, higher eukaryotic organisms also utilize DOM, including components released by bacteria and plants as metabolic end-products and photoassimilates, respectively. As a result, these DOM components may be more important as food for macrodecomposers than the microdecomposers themselves, HS may also benefit aquatic organisms by promoting their growth and protecting them from inimical forces. Conversely, the removal of photons and the release of toxins by HS may be detrimental to aquatic organisms. 7. It is concluded that the central dogma of the foodweb, and its implicit assumption that the energy flow in aquatic ecosystems can be quantified solely by measuring rates of photosynthesis, ingestion of solid food and its digestion by higher organisms, is invalid. To extend our understanding of the role of DOM as a source of nutrition and information to aquatic organisms it is suggested that the subject should be studied within the context of 'modules' which have the following properties: (i) the components have co-evolved; (ii) the more vulnerable components will have protective mechanisms; (iii) the components will derive mutual benefits from co-existence; (iv) sedentary components will release kairomonal attractants or developmental primers; fv) living components will exchange energy and information; (vi) the module will collapse following the removal of strongly interactive keystone species. An example of a three-component, three-subset module, is provided by tubificid worms, epithilic bacteria and algae. A more complex module consisting of pulmonate snails, associated macrophytes, their epiphytic bacteria and algae has four components and six subsets. The elucidation of the interactive mechanisms within such modules demands an interdisciplinary approach, involving microbiology, biochemistry and behavioural biology.																			0046-5070					AUG	1997	38	1					1	36		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00206.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00206.x													WOS:A1997XR47300001

Prokaryotes inhabiting athalassohaline environments are poorly known and very few of such places have been surveyed for microbial diversity studies around the world. We analyzed the planktonic bacterial and archaeal assemblages inhabiting several of these evaporitic basins in a remote and vast area in northern Chile by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Most systems were springs and athalassohaline ponds in different saltflats of the Atacama Desert region, including Salar de Llamara (in the Central Depression), Salar de Atacama (in the Pre-Andean Depression) and Salar de Ascotan (in the Altiplano). Overall, we analyzed more than 25 samples from 19 different environments with strong gradients of altitude, qualitative ionic compositions and UV influence. Between 4 and 25 well-defined DGGE bands were detected for Bacteria in each sample, whereas Archaea ranged between 1 and 5. Predominant DGGE bands (defined by intensity and frequency of appearance) were excised from the gel and sequenced. Bacterial assemblages were dominated by the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum and a few Proteobacteria. There was a tendency for increasing contribution of CFB with higher salinities and altitude. Thus, CFB accounted for the major fraction of band intensity in the Ascotan samples and for lower percentages in Atacama and Llamara. When the distribution of particular CFB sequences was examined, there were several relatives of Psychroflexus torquis substituting each other as salinity changed in Ascotan. Another set of CFB sequences, very distantly related to Cytophaga marinovorus, was abundant in both Llamara and Atacama at salinities lower than 7%. Archaeal assemblages were dominated by uncultured haloarchaea distantly related to cultured strains mostly obtained from thalassohaline environments. Most of the archaeal sequences did not have a close match with environmental 16S rRNA genes deposited in the database either. Therefore, athalassohaline environments are excellent sources of new microorganisms different from their counterparts in thalassohaline sites and useful tools to relate microbial genetic diversity and environmental characteristics such as changes in salinity (both qualitative and quantitative) and altitude.

The mean value of J(Urea)/M(O2) (N/O-2=0.183) was high for fish but below the theoretical maximum (approximately 0.27) for 100 % aerobic respiration of protein, so an exogenous source of substrates is not required to explain the observed J(Urea). J(Urea) was insensitive to thiourea. Urea excretion occurred largely (80 %) through the gills, but urea-N was also present in bile and urine. Control blood pHe, pHi and [HCO3-] (approximately 8.1, 7.6 and 15 mmoll(-1), respectively, at approximately 32 degrees C) were extremely high. When fish were exposed to lake water titrated with HCl and aerated to remove CO2, N/O-2 progressively declined. At a lake water pH of 7.05 and C-CO2 of 0mmoll(-1), N/O-2 was reduced by 80% and an intense metabolic acidosis occurred (pHe=7.04, [HCO3-]=1.5 mmoll(-1)). Restoration of control water pH9.9 at a C-CO2 of 0mmoll(-1) resulted in intermediate levels of N/O-2 and internal acid-base status. Additional experiments confirmed that urea production was inhibited by low pHe, was dependent on blood [HCO3-] with a K-m of 3.06 mmoll(-1) and was insensitive to acetazolamide. While metabolic acidosis clearly inhibited OUC ureagenesis, the system appeared to be saturated with HCO3- under control conditions so that additional basic equivalent loading would not stimulate ureagenesis. Urea production in the Lake Magadi tilapia does not appear to remove exogenous HCO3- or to play a role in normal acid-base regulation.

It provides new satellite resource to accurately and effectively monitor leaf area index (LAI). In this study, the monitoring of LAI was conducted with different land cover types during two times (July 26th July 30th, 2014, and July 28th August 5th, 2015), with the adoption of the Poyang Lake basin as the study area. Then the linear and nonlinear correlation analyses were conducted on the measured LAI data and the corresponding single-band data of GF-1 as well as 8 vegetation indexes (VIs). By constructing the LAI remote sensing inversion model, the high-accuracy LAI data were extracted. The research results indicate that, the data in the BLUE, GREEN, RED bands of GF-1 have high correlations with each other (R>0.89), but the data in near-infrared (NIR) band of GF-1 have poor correlations with the data in other three bands (R<0.3). The NIR and RED bands has strong reflection and absorption capacities separately, which is connected with the plant's spectral characteristics. LAI is negatively correlated with the reflectivity data in the BLUE, GREEN, RED bands of GF-1 but is positively correlated with VIs and the reflectivity data in the NIR band of GF-1. Most VIs are superior to single-band models in terms of the inversion of LAI. However, using the exponential model, the correlation between NDVI and the measured LAI is largest (R-2=0.744 and RMSE = 0.303). The results satisfy F test and have significant correlations. Accordingly, GF-1 satellite data is applicable to the monitoring of LAI with a high resolution over large areas.

J	Lotze, HK				Lotze, Heike K.			Rise and fall of fishing and marine resource use in the Wadden Sea, southern North Sea	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The Wadden Sea is the world's largest intertidal ecosystem and one of the most productive coastal areas worldwide. People have fished and hunted marine resources in the Wadden Sea since its origin similar to 7500 years ago, but have since depleted the majority of formerly important species and their supporting habitats. Most of these changes have been lost from memory. Here, I reconstructed the history of fishing and marine resource use in the Wadden Sea using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines archaeological, historical, fisheries, and ecological records. Early farmers and settlers used a great variety of coastal mammals, birds, fish, and shellfish from similar to 5000-500 years ago. During the Middle Ages (500-1500 AD) fish gained in importance over birds, mammals, and shellfish, and fishing gradually replaced hunting and gathering along the coast. About 1000 years ago, freshwater and migrating fish stocks in European inland lakes and rivers declined because of overfishing and habitat degradation. This induced an expansion and commercialization of marine fisheries along the coast, first for herring and oysters in the 12th and 13th centuries, later for haddock and cod in the 16th century. Exploitation of birds and whales was also commercialized and some species started to decline with increasing exploitation pressure. During Modem Times (1500-1800 AD), commercial fisheries further developed for rays, flatfish, lobster, and shrimp along the coast and for sturgeon and salmon in the estuaries. Intensification of exploitation in the 19th century led. to strong depletion of many coastal resources and several fisheries collapsed in the early 1900s. As a result, new fisheries were developed for formerly less valued species but many declined or collapsed before the end of the 20th century. Today, the only remaining commercial fisheries target shrimp, blue mussels, and cockles. On the other side, conservation efforts have recovered some formerly exploited species, especially birds and seals. Meanwhile, fishing has been gradually replaced by tourism and nature conservation along the coast. The history of the Wadden Sea may serve as an example for a coastal region that sustained people for millennia, was heavily exploited and transformed over time, but still shows some potential for recovery where protection and restoration efforts are integrated into coastal management plans.

J	Birks, HH; Larsen, E; Birks, HJB				Birks, HH; Larsen, E; Birks, HJB			Did tree-Betula, Pinus and Picea survive the last glaciation along the west coast of Norway? A review of the evidence, in light of Kullman (2002)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We discuss the hypotheses proposed by Kullman [Geo-Oko21 (2000) 141; Nordic Journal of Botany21 (2001) 39; Journal of Biogeography29 (2002) 1117] on the basis of radiocarbon-dated megafossils of late-glacial age from the central Swedish mountains that boreal trees survived the glaciation along the south-west coast of Norway and subsequently migrated eastward early in the late-glacial to early deglaciated parts of the central Swedish Scandes mountains. Methods We assess these hypotheses on the basis of glacial geological evidence and four lines of palaeoecological evidence, namely macrofossil records of the tree species, vegetation and climate reconstructions from plant evidence, independent climate reconstructions from other proxies for the late-glacial environment of south-west Norway, and the patterns of post-glacial spread of the tree species. Location South and west Norway, central Swedish Scandes mountains (Jamtland). Results and conclusions South-west Norway and the adjacent continental shelf were under ice at the last-glacial maximum (LGM). The late-glacial vegetation of south-west Norway was treeless and summer temperatures were below the thermal limits for Betula pubescens Ehrh., Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst. Instead of spreading immediately after the onset of Holocene warming, as might have been expected if local populations were surviving, B. pubescens showed a lag of local arrival of 600 to > 1000 years, Pinus lagged by 1500 to > 2000 years, and Picea only reached southern Norway c. 1500 years ago and has not colonized most of south-west Norway west of the watershed. Glacial geological evidence shows the presence of an ice sheet in the Scandes at the LGM and in the Younger Dryas, which was cold-based near or at the area where the late-glacial-dated megafossils were recovered by Kullman. We conclude that the samples dated by Kullman (2002) should be evaluated carefully for possible sources of contamination. All the available evidence shows that the biogeographical hypotheses, based on these radiocarbon dates taken at face value, of late-glacial tree survival at the Norwegian coast and subsequent eastwards spread to the mountains, are unsupportable.

Glukhoye Lake: Middle to Late Holocene environments of Kunashir Island (Kuril Archipelago, Russian Far East)	BOREAS												A multiproxy analysis of a sediment core from Glukhoye Lake in the southern Kuril Islands indicates that the basin originated c. 8.2 cal. ka BP as a brackish lagoon with the subsequent development of a freshwater lake (c. 4.0 to 3.3 cal. ka BP), a bog (c. 3.3 to 2.4 cal. ka BP) and a second lake (c. 2.4 cal. ka BP to present). The basin history primarily reflects local coastal dynamics and is not related to proposed Archipelago-wide changes in sea level. Between c. 8.2 and 8.0 cal. ka BP, the vegetation of southern Kunashir Island was characterized by Betula-Quercus forest with a secondary component of temperate broadleaf trees. Quercus broadleaf forest established c. 8.0 to 6.5 cal. ka BP and represents the Holocene thermal maximum. The remainder of the record shows a gradual decrease in temperate and an increase in conifer taxa, indicating a gradual cooling from the Holocene thermal maximum to c. 2.3 cal. ka BP. Maxima in Picea and Abies pollen between c. 2.3 and 1.1 cal. ka BP suggest conditions that were slightly cooler than present. Palaeovegetation changes in the Kuril Islands as inferred from lake and section data differ in the timing and/or composition of the vegetation communities, although results from the two types of sites become more similar as the number of sections increases. The lake results do not support a previous conceptual model developed for the southern Russian Far East, which linked changes in sea levels to Holocene climate fluctuations. Rather the depositional environments in the lake cores seem more related to coastal dynamics that are independent of fluctuations in sea levels or climate. The difficulty in developing accurate age models for sites with multiple depositional environments may be the most important obstacle for documenting and understanding the Archipelago's vegetation and climate histories.					; Cherepanova, Marina/AAT-4340-2021	Cherepanova, Marina/0000-0002-6530-0093; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				APR	2022	51	2					364	384		10.1111/bor.12565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12565		OCT 2021											WOS:000716206900001

DecTephra: A new database of Deception Island's tephra record (Antarctica)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Deception Island (South Shetland Islands) is one of the most active volcanoes in Antarctica, with more than 20 explosive eruptive events registered over the past few centuries. Recent eruptions (1967, 1969, and 1970) and volcanic unrest episodes (1992, 1999, and 2014-2015) demonstrate that volcanic activity will likely occur in the future. Despite this, there has been a considerable increase in the number of scientific bases, tourist activities and air and vessel traffic in the region during the last several decades. The escalation in interest has increased the amount of infrastructure and population numbers exposed to a future eruption. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an accurate long-term assessment of the volcanic hazard of the island. However, past attempts have always been limited by the incompleteness of the eruptive record. Volcanic ash layers found in marine and lacustrine sediment cores and glaciers outside Deception Island are a fundamental source of information for reconstructing the explosive eruptive record of the volcano. The spatial distribution of the tephra layers, as well as their physicochemical analysis are invaluable for determining the size and explosiveness of past eruptive events, as well as for assessing the extent and impact of their related hazards (e.g., ash fall out). In order to overcome the dispersion of existing data among numerous publications and to facilitate the analysis of available information on tephra layers sourced in Deception Island, we present the DecTephra (Deception Island Tephra Record) database. The current database version contains 362 tephra layers (including cryptotephras) located at sites up to 3115 km distant from the island. For each tephra layer, the database includes: (i) the location and simple description of the sampling site; and (ii) the key petrologic and geochemical features of each tephra layer. A preliminary analysis of the information contained in the DecTephra database (e.g., magma composition, explosiveness, eruptive recurrence, etc.), validates it as a key tool for evaluating past explosive activity of the volcano. In addition, it can function as a valuable resource for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic studies requiring tephrostratigraphical and tephrochronological control at local and regional scales. DecTephra also has the potential to help to assess the contribution of volcanic forcing to Holocene climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere.					; Geyer, Adelina/A-6624-2012; Giralt, Santiago/AAA-8585-2020; Geyer, Adelina/C-9490-2011; Álvarez-Valero, Antonio/B-2732-2015	Aulinas, Meritxell/0000-0003-3795-3537; Geyer, Adelina/0000-0002-8803-6504; Polo Sanchez, Antonio/0000-0001-6945-3487; Hopfenblatt Hours, Joaquin/0000-0003-4235-8302													0377-0273	1872-6097				MAY	2022	425								107516	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2022.107516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2022.107516		MAR 2022											WOS:000792692600002
J	CHITTY, D				CHITTY, D			MORTALITY AMONG VOLES (MICROTUS-AGRESTIS) AT LAKE VYRNWY, MONTGOMERYSHIRE IN 1936-9	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Lake Vyrnwy is a reservoir surrounded by many types of habitat including newly afforested areas suitable for field voles. Other areas form ecological barriers between these populations. The purpose of the present inquiry was to discover the causes of the periodic fluctuations in numbers which occur, often simultaneously, among such vole populations. Several separate vole populations reached peak densities in 1937 and declined in 1938, in which year numbers were at a peak in most of the younger plantations. During the peak breeding season of 1937 there was an excessive juvenile mortality before Aug. The survival rate of the young then improved and the old animals became scarce, as they usually do at this time of year. All age groups ceased breeding in Aug., 1937, and the survivors did not breed next spring. By contrast, populations which were at peak densities in 1938 continued breeding from May to Oct. and the survivors bred again in 1939, though no recovery in numbers was brought about. Both in May, 1937 and May, 1938 high numbers were associated with unusually high body wts. A sample population was studied by marking and recapturing the animals. Most spent their lives within an area of 10-15 yd. diam. Both in Sept., 1936, and Sept., 1937, there were about 300 young voles per acre. During 1938 survival was very poor after Jan., particularly among males. During the time of their almost complete disappearance in 1938 or 1939 voles were not subjected to any known environmental conditions likely to have caused excessive mortality. It is suggested that death was primarily due to adverse conditions to which their parents were subjected in the previous breeding season. It is inferred (a) that the high juvenile mortality at that time was a symptom of severe intraspecific strife, (b) that intraspecific strife had deleterious effects, probably upon the hormone balance of the females, so that (c) their yound suffered defects which reduced the longevity of those which survived the breeding season, and also (d) impaired their ability to produce a normal generation. Peak numbers were reached simultaneously over wider areas than seems likely by chance alone. This must have occurred through some interaction of the independent biological units with their common weather system. Competition for space, the process believed to control excessive increase, is shown to be a possible means through which environmental changes may cause further variations in mortality rates. A sufficiently variable physical environment should thus tend to eliminate differences in density between populations and so to effect a regional synchrony of their cycles. It seems likely that periodic mortality in the N. American snowshoe hare is also a delayed result of intraspecific strife. This extension of the hypothesis has implications which are at variance with some of the existing views about cycles in birds and mammals.																			0962-8436	1471-2970					1952	236	638					505	+		10.1098/rstb.1952.0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1952.0009													WOS:A1952YF90200001
J	Fong, YL; Jiang, S; Wang, CF				Fong, Youliang; Jiang, Shu; Wang, Chunfang			Sequence stratigraphy, sedimentary systems and petroleum plays in a low-accommodation basin: Middle to upper members of the Lower Jurassic Sangonghe Formation, Central Junggar Basin, Northwestern China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Lower Jurassic Junggar Basin is a low-accommodation basin in northwestern China. Because of low subsidence rates and a warm, wet climate, deposits of the Central subbasin of the Junggar Basin formed from fluvial, deltaic, shallow lake facies. Sequence stratigraphy and sedimentary systems of the Lower Jurassic members of the Sangonghe Formation (J(1)s) were evaluated by observing cores, interpreting wireline logs and examining seismic profiles. Two third-order sequences were recognized in the strata. The distribution of the sedimentary systems in the systems tracts shows that tectonic movement, paleorelief, paleoclimate and changes in lake level controlled the architecture of individual sequences. During the development of the lowstand systems tract (LST), the intense structural movement of the basin resulted in a significant fall in the water level in the lake, accompanied by rapid accommodation decrease. Braided rivers and their deltaic systems were also developed in the Central Junggar Basin. Sediments carried by braided rivers were deposited on upward slopes of the paleorelief, and braid-delta fronts were deposited on downward slopes. During the transgressive systems tract (TST), the tectonic movement of the basin was quiescent and the climate was warm and humid. Lake levels rose and accommodation increased quickly, shoal lines moved landward, and shore- to shallow-lake deposits, sublacustrine fans and deep-lake facies were deposited in shallow- to deep-lake environments. During the highstand systems tract (HST), the accommodation no longer increased but sediment supply continued, far exceeding accommodation. HST deposits slowly formed in shallow-lake to meandering river delta-front environments. Relatively low rates of structural subsidence and low accommodation resulted in coarse-grained successions that were fining upward. Deposits were controlled by structural movement and paleorelief within the LST to TST deposits in the Central subbasin. Fine- to medium-grained coarsening-upward successions developed during the HST. The sand bodies of braid-delta fronts on the downward slopes of the paleorelief in the LST and the sublacustrine fans in the TST became reservoirs for hydrocarbon accumulation. Petroleum plays have only been found in the Sangonghe Formation (J(1)s) located on structural ridges that consist of sand bodies comprising these sequences. Favorable conditions for petroleum plays in HST1-LST2 occur where the sand bodies have been fractured by faults and sealed by denudation and pinch-out lines, then overlain by deep lake mudstone in TST2. The favorable condition of the sand bodies within TST2 occurs where isolated sand bodies have been fractured by faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Schmitt, CJ; Stricker, CA; Brumbaugh, WG				Schmitt, Christopher J.; Stricker, Craig A.; Brumbaugh, William G.			Mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnification in Ozark stream ecosystems	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Crayfish (Orconectes spp.), Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), northern hog sucker (hog sucker; Hypentelium nigricans), and smallmouth bass (smallmouth; Micropterus dolomieu) from streams in southeastern Missouri (USA) were analyzed for total mercury (HgT) and for stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (8345) to discern Hg transfer pathways. HgT concentrations were generally lowest in crayfish (0.005-0.112 mu g/g dw) and highest in smallmouth (0.093-4.041 mu g/g dw), as was delta N-15. HgT was also lower and delta N-15 was higher in all biota from a stream draining a more heavily populated historical lead-zinc mining area than from similar sites with mostly undeveloped forested watersheds. delta C-13 in biota was lowest at spring-influenced sites, reflecting CO2 inputs and temperature influences, and delta S-34 increased from south to north in all taxa. However, HgT was not strongly correlated with either delta C-13 or delta S-34 in biota. Trophic position (TP) computed from crayfish delta N-15 was lower in hog suckers (mean=2.8) than in smallmouth (mean=3.2), but not at all sites. HgT, delta C-13, delta S-34, and TP in hog suckers increased with total length (length) at some sites, indicating site-specific ontogenetic diet shifts. Changes with length were less evident in small mouth. Length-adjusted HgT site means in both species were strongly correlated with HgT in crayfish (r(2)=0.97, P<0.01), but not with HgT in Corbicula (r(2)=0.02, P>0.05). ANCOVA and regression models incorporating only TP and, for hog suckers, length, accurately and precisely predicted HgT concentrations in both fish species from all locations. Although low compared to many areas of the USA, HgT (and therefore methylmercury) concentrations in smallmouth and hog suckers are sufficiently high to represent a threat to human health and wildlife. Our data indicate that in Ozark streams, Fig concentrations in crayfish are at least partly determined by their diet, with concentrations in hog suckers, smallmouth, and possibly other higher-level consumers largely determined by concentrations in crayfish and other primary and secondary consumers, fish growth rates, and TP.

J	Hernández, MD; Alcocer, J; Oseguera, LA; Escobar, E				del Carmen Hernandez, Maria; Alcocer, Javier; Oseguera, Luis A.; Escobar, Elva			Profundal benthic invertebrates in an oligotrophic tropical lake: different strategies for coping with anoxia	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The deep benthic communities of tropical lakes are poorly understood with respect to their composition, abundance, biomass and regulatory factors. Whereas the hypolimnia of temperate oligotrophic lakes remain oxygenated, the higher temperatures in tropical lakes frequently lead to the rapid development of hypolimnetic anoxia independent of trophic status. The deep benthic communities of tropical lakes must therefore develop strategies to respond to anoxic conditions. The dynamics of the deep benthic community of Lake Alchichica were studied over 15 months. We hypothesized that the sedimentation of the winter diatom bloom constitutes an input of high-quality food that contributes to the establishment and development of the deep benthic community. However, the remineralization of this organic matter leads to the prompt development of hypolimnetic anoxia, thus limiting the establishment and/or persistence of the deep benthic community. In contrast with the diverse littoral benthic community (50 taxa) in Lake Alchichica, only two species constitute its deep benthic community, the ostracod Candona cf. patzcuaro and the chironomid Chironomus cf. austini, which combined exhibit a low density (1197 +/- 1976 ind m(-2)) and biomass (16.13 +/- 30.81 mg C m(-2)). C. patzcuaro is dominant and is present throughout the year, whereas Ch. austini is recorded only when the bottom water of the lake is oxygenated. A comparison with the analogous but temperate Lake Mergozzo in Italy illustrates the role that anoxia plays in tropical lakes by diminishing not only taxonomic richness (13 vs 2 spp. in temperate versus tropical lakes, respectively) but also abundance (1145 vs 287 ind m-2, respectively). C. patzcuaro is found throughout the annual cycle of the lake's profundal zone, entering into diapause during the anoxic period and recovering as soon as the profundal zone reoxygenates. Ch. austini has adjusted its life cycle to use the habitat and available resources while the bottom of the lake is oxygenated and emerges en masse at the onset of anoxia. The presence of oxygen and abundant fresh food favors the development of the deep benthic community and yields increases in density and biomass. However, the anoxia that rapidly occurs during the stratification period and the presence of hydrogen sulfide are the key factors that limit deep benthic community colonization and/or permanence in the profundal zone of the tropical Lake Alchichica.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Escobar Briones, Elva/0000-0002-8485-7495; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	2					387	399		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.910	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.910													WOS:000339154600001

Changes in the frequency and return level of high ozone pollution events over the eastern United States following emission controls	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In order to quantify the impact of recent efforts to abate surface ozone (O-3) pollution, we analyze changes in the frequency and return level of summertime (JJA) high surface O-3 events over the eastern United States (US) from 1988-1998 to 1999-2009. We apply methods from extreme value theory (EVT) to maximum daily 8-hour average ozone (MDA8 O-3) observed by the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) and define O-3 extremes as days on which MDA8 O-3 exceeds a threshold of 75 ppb (MDA8 O-3 > 75). Over the eastern US, we find that the number of summer days with MDA8 O-3 > 75 declined on average by about a factor of two from 1988-1998 to 1999-2009. The applied generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) fits the high tail of MDA8 O-3 much better than a Gaussian distribution and enables the derivation of probabilistic return levels (describing the probability of exceeding a value x within a time window T) for high O-3 pollution events. This new approach confirms the significant decline in both frequency and magnitude of high O-3 pollution events over the eastern US during recent years reported in prior studies. Our analysis of 1-yr and 5-yr return levels at each station demonstrates the strong impact of changes in air quality regulations and subsequent control measures (e. g., the 'NOx SIP Call'), as the 5-yr return levels of the period 1999-2009 correspond roughly to the 1-yr return levels of the earlier time period (1988-1998). Regionally, the return levels dropped between 1988-1998 and 1999-2009 by about 8 ppb in the Mid-Atlantic (MA) and Great Lakes (GL) regions, while the strongest decline, about 13 ppb, is observed in the Northeast (NE) region. Nearly all stations (21 out of 23) have 1-yr return levels well below 100 ppb and 5-yr return levels well below 110 ppb in 1999-2009. Decreases in eastern US O-3 pollution are largest after full implementation of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions under the 'NOx SIP Call'. We conclude that the application of EVT methods provides a useful approach for quantifying return levels of high O-3 pollution in probabilistic terms, which may help to guide long-term air quality planning.					; Fang, Yuanyuan/F-1308-2011; Rieder, Harald/Y-8951-2019; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Polvani, Lorenzo/E-5949-2011	Fiore, Arlene/0000-0003-0221-2122; Fang, Yuanyuan/0000-0001-7067-7103; Rieder, Harald/0000-0003-2705-0801													1748-9326					JAN-MAR	2013	8	1							014012	10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014012													WOS:000316998300020

Methane is extracted from water by the application of a vacuum to a membrane gas/liquid exchange module and analysed by a portable cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyser (Picarro (R) G2201-i). The system was calibrated for concentration and delta C-13 of CH4 using synthetic water standards. Reference samples were analysed with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectroscopy (GC-C-IRMS) via the headspace method. All results show good correlations for CH4 concentration (R-2 = 0.994) and a measuring accuracy of 0.002 ppm (CH4 concentration) and 0.6 % (delta C-13-CH4). Calculated response times t were averaged, resulting in 13.5 s. This allows much faster analyses compared to previously published methods. This method was successfully tested in a field campaign at Lake Stechlin (Germany), which has a pronounced CH4 peak at the thermocline in summer. Hypolimnic CH4 concentrations up to 0.6 mu mol/l indicate microbial methanogenesis in the well-oxygenated upper 10 m of the water column. Simultaneous measurements by the CRDS-membrane system (M-CRDS), a membrane combined with off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer system (MICOS) and gas chromatography (GC) show similar results. 24-hour measurements were performed at the depth of maximum CH4 concentration and indicate short-term variations of 0.2 mu mol/l (CH4 concentration) and 7% (delta C-13-CH4) within 24 hours. The MCRDS provides a high temporal and spatial data resolution for accurate detection, mapping and quantification of CH4 distribution in aquatic systems. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Ophrydium versatile is a symbiotic ciliate which forms gelatinous colonies up to several centimetres in diameter in transparent temperate lakes. The ciliates are evenly spaced at the colony surface and constitute a small proportion of the surface area (7%) and volume (3.1%) of the colony, but a large proportion of organic carbon (74%) and nitrogen content (82%) (exemplified for 1 cm3 Colonies). The majority of the colony volume is formed by the jelly. The biomass proportion of ciliates scales inversely with colony size, following the decline of surface area to colony volume. The largest colonies found in Danish lakes in early summer contain almost 1 million ciliates, and assuming they derive from a single ciliate undergoing exponential division, they need twenty generations and, presumably, almost a year to reach maximum size. 2. The ciliates contain numerous symbiotic zoochlorellae that constitute about 10% of ciliate volume and more than half of the carbon content. Zoochlorellae dominate oxygen metabolism of the assemblage, resulting in low light compensation points, a large diel photosynthetic surplus, and a marked dependence on light for sustained growth and ciliate metabolism. Estimated gross photosynthesis (7 ng C ciliate-1 day-1) of Ophrydium from shallow, clear waters in June greatly exceeded the estimated carbon contained in filtered bacteria and small algae (1.9 ng C ciliate-1 day-1). Nitrogen and phosphorus content of the prey, however, may provide the main nutrient source consistent with the correspondence between mass-specific rates of nutrient uptake and measured relative growth rates (average 0.067 day- 1, generation time 10 days). 3. The large Ophrydium colonies require increased allocation of photosynthetic carbohydrates with increasing colony size to maintain the jelly. The large colonies tend to become gas-filled, floating, mechanically destroyed and their ciliate inhabitants abandon them as swarmers. Colony formation, however, should offer protection against predators which may be more important for the natural abundance than the costs of growing in a colony.

J	Harper, KA; Mascarúa-López, L; Macdonald, SE; Drapeau, P				Harper, Karen A.; Mascarua-Lopez, Liliana; Macdonald, S. Ellen; Drapeau, Pierre			Interaction of edge influence from multiple edges:: examples from narrow corridors	PLANT ECOLOGY												The simultaneous influence from multiple edges on remnant forest patches (such as wildlife corridors, protection buffers, small unharvested remnants or corners of larger patches) in harvested forest landscapes could impair, or possibly enhance, their effectiveness. When multiple edges are in close proximity, there may be interactions of edge influence such that the observed response is greater or less than would result from the influence of either edge alone. We examined possible ways in which two nearby forest edges of similar or different types might interact in terms of their influence on forest structure. We present an 'edge interaction' model for three possible types of interaction of edge influence: (1) no interaction, edge influence is limited to the strongest influence from either edge, (2) positive interaction, observed edge influence is greater than from either edge alone; (3) negative interaction or resistance, the influence from both edges is less than from a single edge (e.g., an older edge is resistant to effects from a younger edge). Empirical data for forest structure at the edges of cutblocks (harvested areas) and water bodies were entered into the models to predict edge influence in narrow forest corridors assuming the null hypothesis of no interaction. Randomization tests were used to compare predictions to observed edge influence on recently-fallen logs and Populus spp. (P. tremuloides Michx. and P. balsamifera L.) sapling density in lakeshore buffers in boreal mixedwood forest as well as on canopy cover and log, tree and snag abundance in riparian buffers and forested corridors separating cutblocks in Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP. forest. In lakeshore buffers, there was evidence of both positive and negative interaction at different locations within the buffer or at different times since buffer creation for both the abundance of logs and Populus sapling density. Trends suggested positive interaction for canopy cover and live tree density in riparian buffers and cutblock separators, and for snag density near the cut edges of riparian buffers. Testing hypotheses arising from our model of interaction of edge influence could lead to a clearer understanding of edge influence in fragmented landscapes.					; Harper, Karen/R-4735-2019	Harper, Karen/0000-0001-5390-0262; Drapeau, Pierre/0000-0002-1115-2531													1385-0237	1573-5052				SEP	2007	192	1					71	84		10.1007/s11258-006-9227-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-006-9227-z													WOS:000249204100006

Historical contamination of the Anacostia River, Washington, DC	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The tidal Anacostia River in Washington DC has long been impacted by various sources of chemical pollution over the past 200 years. To explore more recent inputs of various chemicals, six sediment cores were collected for dating and chemical analysis in the downstream section of the tidal Anacostia River. Profiles of contaminants in sediment cores can be useful in determining management direction and effectiveness of pollution controls over time. There were two main objectives for this investigation: (1) determine current sediment contaminant levels; (2) determine a historical perspective of the sediment changes in contamination using (137)Cs and (210)Pb dating. The determination of an age-depth relationship using (210)Pb and (137)Cs dating gave somewhat different results, suggesting that the assumptions of (210)Pb dating were not met. Using the (137)Cs horizon allowed an assignment of approximate sediment accumulation rates and hence an age-depth relationship to contaminant events in the upper portions of the cores. Total PAHs showed higher concentrations at depth and lower surface concentrations. In the upper sections, PAHs were a mixture of combustion and petrogenic sources, while at depth the signature appeared to be of natural origins. Total PCBs, DDTs and chlordane concentrations showed a maximum in recent sediments, decreasing towards the surface. PCBs had lower molecular weight congeners near the surface and higher molecular weights at depth. A phthalate ester, DEHP, appeared in the mid 1940-1950s, and decreased towards the surface. Trace elements fell roughly into three groups. Fe, Mn, and As were in approximately constant proportion to Al, except in some deeper, sandy sediments, where they showed enrichments linked to redox conditions. Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn had low concentrations in the deepest sediments, high concentrations at mid-depths, and declines to intermediate levels at the surface. Ni and Cr followed neither of these patterns closely. We observed that many contaminants appeared in the Anacostia sediments at various times, and reached relatively high concentrations in the past, but are now showing declines in loadings. In some cases, such as PCBs, DDT, chlordane, and Pb from leaded gasoline, these declines can be clearly linked to the discontinuation of their use for environmental reasons. For other contaminants (e.g., PAHs, DEHP, selected metals) these declines are more likely the result of changes in production, usage and waste control.

The genus contains at present 83 spp. of which 9 are described from females. The type material for 16 of these species has not been found. Presented in alphabetical order are 142 spp. which have been listed under Micropsectra. This list contains: name of author, reference to description, name of original genus, present status of species, reference to the paper in which this was listed and collection in which the type material is deposited. Morphological characteristics, evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships of Microspectra are discussed. The genera Rheotanytarsus, Parapsectra, Krenopsectra, Micropsectra and Paratanytarsus form a monophyletic group within the tribe Tanytarsini. The group is referred to as the Micropsectra series. Rheotanytarsus, the most plesiomorphic genus in the series, has a worldwide distribution. This supports the conclusions reached by the morphological analysis. The genera Parapsectra and Krenopsectra are only known from the Palearctic and Nearctic Regions. The great majority of Micropsectra spp. are found in the Palearctic and Nearctic Regions. A smaller number of species occur in the northern part of the Oriental Region, which has the same environmental conditions as the adjacent areas of the Palearctic Region. Two doubtful species have been reported from India. Genus Paratanytarsus has a wider distribution but clearly has its origin on the northern hemisphere. The habitat selection in the Micropsectra series is studied and compared with the phylogeny. The species within the plesiomorphic genera Rheotanytarsus, Parapsectra and Krenopsectra are found in streams and springs. In the more apomorphic genus Micropsectra, many of the species occur in these types of habitats, though there are also a comparatively high number of species occurring in lakes. Paratanytarsus, the most apomorphic genus, contains species which inhabit shallow standing waters. The ancestor of the Micropsectra series was probably an inhabitant of running water. A lectotype is designated for Tanytarsus retusus Goetghebuer.																			0013-8711						1982	13	4					371	400																WOS:A1982PV26700001
J	Ludlam, SD				Ludlam, SD			The comparative limnology of high arctic, coastal, meromictic lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Five important features appear in rough order from the surface downwards in physical and chemical profiles from high arctic coastal meromictic lakes. These features are: (1) a supersaturated oxygen maximum, (2) the center of the oxycline, (3) a thermal maximum, (4) a major absorption maximum, and (5) an anoxic stratum. The depth of the absorption maxima and the top of the anoxic strata are both statistically correlated to light penetration and to each other. The depth of the thermal maximum also shows a statistical correlation to light penetration among lakes with a relatively shallow chemocline. The temperature of the thermal maximum appears to be maintained by inputs of light energy while the oxygen maximum is; maintained to a large extent by photosynthesis. Thus, these major features are all influenced by light penetration. With the exception of the supersaturated oxygen maximum, all of the above features are dependent for their existence upon the primary chemocline stabilizing the water column. Apparently, in at least some lakes, a near surface secondary chemocline or cool (ca. 4 degrees C) secondary inverse thermocline will enhance the stability of the water column above the primary chemocline sufficiently to allow a supersaturated oxygen maximum to develop in this region. However, the supersaturated oxygen maximum can extend into the primary chemocline, and in highly transparent Sophia Lake (Cornwallis Island, N.W.T.) this feature extends below the primary chemocline. Where the chemocline is found below depths with adequate illumination, features other than the supersaturated oxygen maximum should be found in deeper water as well, or they should be eliminated from the profiles. Thus, where the chemocline is relatively shallow, the depth of features like the thermal maximum or anoxic strata are related most closely to light penetration, but where chemoclines are deep, as in Lake Tuborg (Ellesmere Island, N.W.T.), the depth of the chemocline determines the depth of the oxycline, thermal maximum, absorption maximum and anoxic stratum.																			0921-2728					SEP	1996	16	2					111	131																WOS:A1996VG04200002

Internal eutrophication of restored peatland stream: The role of bed sediments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The improvement of site hydrology is a major determinant of the success or failure of wetland restoration. Unfortunately, the influence of new hydrological conditions on wetland chemistry and nutrient cycling is often ignored or simply not monitored. This study assessed how changes in the composition of stream sediments that occurred after pearland stream restoration affected the pool and bioavailability of phosphorus (P) stored on the stream floor. The studied watercourses were located in the Narew River valley, NE Poland. They were restored in 2002 by excavating channels about 4-6 m wide and 1-1.5 m deep. Channels were cut through a peat layer to basal sands that underlay the organic deposits. Due to fallacious assumption about the high stability of peat stream banks, the banks were not modelled or protected by any technical measures to eliminate potential slump and erosion. Within a few years of the completion of the restoration project, peat bank failures led to the substantial deposition of organic material onto the floor of the newly created water-bodies. This resulted in an increase in the mean total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the sediment from 19 mu mol g(-1) to more than 35 mu mol g(-1) as well as an increase in both the concentration and pool of potentially mobile P fractions. A potential for the release of P was confirmed by the change in the concentration of P fractions that has been recorded over the summer period. Between June and October 2008 their content in the top 1-cm layer diminished from 134.1 mmol m(-2) to 100.6 mmol m(-2), implying an average net release of P of about 0.3 mmol m(-2) day(-1). This suggests that examined sediments primarily act as a highly dynamic transformer system, being the sink for particulate organic and mineral forms of P and serving as the net source of bioavailable (soluble reactive phosphorus) SRP.

The distribution of total and methyl Hg in surface waters along the Carson River was similar to that measured in river bank sediments and influenced by how regimes. High levels of Hg (up to 7,585 and 7.2 ng Hg/L for total and methyl Hg, respectively) determined on surface water samples were in large part discharged from Hg-contaminated tailings, distributed in the river bank sediments. Once introduced into the river during the spring snowmelt runoff, Hg was transported downstream and accumulated in the lacustrine part of the system. Elemental Hg (Hg-o) increased from 0.02 ng/L in the noncontaminated region to about 2 ng/L in the reservoir. The vertical distribution of total methylmercury (MeHg(T)) in water of the reservoir differs from that observed elsewhere, in both Hg-contaminated and noncontaminated lakes. The highest levels of MeHg(T) (<1 ng/L as Hg) and acid-reactive Hg (4 ng/L) were observed in the alkaline and oxic surface waters. The decrease of pH with depth and the absence of oxygen in depth >10 m did not enhance MeHg production. In the anoxic hypolimnion of the reservoir, the recycling of MeHg(T) was more influenced by the redox cycling of Mn. The addition of group VI anions (SeO42-, MoO42-, and WO42-) in the range of concentrations of oxyanion-forming elements found in the Carson River system to anoxic sediment slurry spiked with SO42- resulted in the reduction of rates of MeHg production. Their negative effect on MeHg production was enhanced by increasing pH. Group VI anions, analogous to SO42- are inhibitory to sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are known to play a key role in MeHg production in anoxic sediments. Accordingly, the particular water geochemistry of the Carson River system could partly explain the observed low levels of MeHg where one would expect higher concentrations.

Beaver (Castor canadensis); use of borrow pits in an industrial landscape in northwestern Alberta	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Borrow pits, dug by industry to provide substrate for infrastructure such as roads and well sites, are prevalent throughout the boreal forest of western Canada yet little is known about their use by wildlife. During field surveys in Rainbow Lake, Alberta, we found that beavers (Castor canadensis) used inundated borrow pits extensively for foraging and over wintering, suggesting that borrow pits increase beaver populations above their natural carrying capacity in industrial landscapes. We visited a random sample of 90 borrow pits in the field and categorized them as having active beaver lodges with caches (n =16), inactive lodges (n = 13), cutting (n = 29), no activity (n = 13), or as not inundated or not a borrow pit (n = 19). We then used this sample to model where beavers established lodges versus where they were inactive or were only cutting. We found that borrow pits with active lodges had unique characteristics from other pits in our sample and were closer to streams, marshes, and swamps and had greater vegetation concealment from roads. These models can be used by managers to develop methods for increasing or decreasing the abundance of beavers living at borrow pits. Wildlife managers might want to use borrow pits to increase beaver abundance because of the positive effects beavers can have on ecosystems and because beavers are an important source of food for boreal carnivores. For example, we found that wolverines (Gulo gulo) used borrow pits as hunting grounds for beavers and one wolverine denned within a beaver lodge at a borrow pit. Conversely, managers might want to reduce beaver populations living at borrow pits because of the damage that beavers can cause to infrastructure and because subsidized beaver populations might alter predator-prey dynamics. To accomplish this, we suggest reducing available vegetation around borrow pits, isolating new borrow pits from natural beaver habitats, digging borrow pits where there is less chance of having surface water, filling in borrow pits with substrate, or not creating borrow pits and using a centralized gravel pit or mine for substrate.					; Boyce, Mark/A-2620-2014	Scrafford, Matthew/0000-0001-9971-6495; Boyce, Mark/0000-0001-5811-325X													0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2020	269								110800	10.1016/j.icarus.2020.110800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.110800								32561009					WOS:000541757200011

The SGR was calculated by taking into account only the abundance of bacterioplankton at the beginning (0 h) and at the end (48 h) incubation period, at room or river temperature. The mean SGR was less and significantly different in the surface waters of river Kapila, Shimsha, Suvarnavathy and Arkavathy. But it was more and significantly different in river Cauvery when compared to other tributaries. This suggests that the river Cauvery was more favorable habitat for SGR of bacterioplankton than the other four watercourses studied. Investigation of interrelationship between SGR and other bacterial variables showed presence of only one correlation with direct counts of particle bound bacteria in river Arkavathy. Further, the relationship between SGR of bacterioplankton and other environmental variables showed the presence of six correlations in river Shimsha, five in river Suvarnavathy, three in river Cauvery, and two each in river Kapila and river Arkavathy. Negative SGR were recorded on thirteen occasions in river Cauvery followed by eleven in river Shimsha, nine in river Suvarnavathy, seven in river Arkavathy and five in river Kapila, out of fifty SGR determinations. This negative SGR were a result of decrease in the observed bacterial cell counts after 48 h incubation from that of 0 h count. The probable reason for such negative growth rate and dependency of SGR of bacterioplankton and environmental variables has been discussed.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2009	154	1-4					169	185		10.1007/s10661-008-0387-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0387-2								18600464					WOS:000267824400016

Contrasting perspectives on the Lava Creek Tuff eruption, Yellowstone, from new U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The youngest major caldera-forming event at Yellowstone was the similar to 630-ka eruption of the Lava Creek Tuff. The tuff as mapped consists of two major ignimbrite packages (members A and B), linked to widespread coeval fall deposits and formation of the Yellowstone Caldera. Subsequent activity included emplacement of numerous rhyolite flows and domes, and development of two structurally resurgent domes (Mallard Lake and Sour Creek) that accommodate strain due to continual uplift/subsidence cycles. Uplifted lithologies previously mapped on and adjacent to Sour Creek dome were thought to include the similar to 2.08-Ma Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, cropping out beneath Lava Creek Tuff members A and B. Mapped outcrops of this Huckleberry Ridge Tuff material were sampled as welded ignimbrite (sample YR345) on Sour Creek dome, and at nearby Bog Creek as welded ignimbrite (YR311) underlain by an indurated lithic lag breccia containing blocks of another welded ignimbrite (YR324). Zircon near-rim U-Pb analyses from these samples yield weighted mean ages of 661 +/- 13 ka (YR345: 95% confidence), 655 +/- 11 ka (YR311), and 664 +/- 15 ka (YR324) (combined weighted mean of 658.8 +/- 6.6 ka). We also studied two samples of ignimbrite previously mapped as Huckleberry Ridge Tuff on the northeastern perimeter of the Yellowstone Caldera, similar to 12 km ENE of Sour Creek dome. Sanidines from these samples yield 40Ar/39Ar age estimates of 634.5 +/- 6.8 ka (8YC-358) and 630.9 +/- 4.1 ka (8YC-359). These age data show that all these units represent previously unrecognized parts of the Lava Creek Tuff and do not have any relationship to the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff. Our observations and data imply that the Lava Creek eruption was more complex than is currently assumed, incorporating two tuff units additional to those currently mapped, and which themselves are separated by a time break sufficient for cooling and some reworking. The presence of a lag breccia suggests that a source vent lay nearby (< similar to 3 km) for some of the tuffs and that the Yellowstone Caldera boundary in this area could be reconsidered.

J	Cai, XM; Hourston, RAS; Steyn, DG				Cai, XM; Hourston, RAS; Steyn, DG			A numerical study of meteorological conditions during PACIFIC '93	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												An extensive field study (called PACIFIC '93), designed to obtain a comprehensive dataset for use in understanding photochemical episodes, was carried out in the Lower Fraser Valley (LFV), B.C., Canada in the summer of 1993. Although many observational studies on local chemistry and meteorology have been reported, there is no complete description of three-dimensional, time-varying meteorological conditions over the whole LFV This study attempts to fill this gap by employing a mesoscale model, the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS). In general, the model results agree well with observations, with the index of agreement for surface temperature and wind reaching as high as 0.8 during the daytime, but dropping to 0.4 at night. A good performance is achieved by the model in this long integration for less than three days. Occurrence of local weather systems such as thunderstorms deteriorates overall performance The modelled vertical structure of wind and temperature at a site close to the Coast Mountains agrees well with tethersonde observations, especially during the daytime. Modelled trajectories demonstrate that tracers released from a surface location near the root of the Coast Mountain follow trajectories determined by two wind systems: westerly sea breezes and southerly rip-valley winds. Up-valley winds are shown to be a mechanism responsible for transport of tracers to tributary valleys in the Coast Mountains. This finding corroborates the results of McKendry et al. (1998) who investigated transport of pollutants up Pitt Lake Valley The model results also suggest that convergent thermal plumes near mountain ridges might be mechanisms responsible for carrying pollutants to relatively high elevations in the stable layer These pollutants, in the present case, are trans ported by the upper flows back to the LFV.

THE EVOLUTION AND AGES OF MAKGADIKGADI PALAEO-LAKES: CONSILIENT EVIDENCE FROM KALAHARI DRAINAGE EVOLUTION SOUTH-CENTRAL AFRICA	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The Makgadikgadi Pans in northern Botswana are the desiccated relicts of a former major inland lake system, with fossil shorelines preserved at five distinct elevations (similar to 995 m, 945 m, 936 m, 920 m and 912 m). These lakes persisted in the Makgadikgadi Basin, which evolved in the Okavango-Makgadikgadi Rift Zone: the south-western extension of the East African Rift System (EARS) into northern Botswana. This paper synthesizes cross-disciplinary evidence, which reveals that the antiquity of this lake complex has been widely underestimated. It presents a Regional Drainage Evolution Model that invokes tectonically initiated drainage reorganizations as the underlying control over lake evolution. Lake formation was initiated by rift-flank uplift along the Chobe Fault, across the course of the Zambezi River, which diverted the regional drainage net into the Makgadikgadi Basin. Filling of the basin initiated a major climatic feedback mechanism that locally increased rainfall and lowered evaporation rates. This progressively enhanced water input to the basin, and most likely led to overtopping of the Chobe Horst barrier during the three highest lake stands, with outflow into the Zambezi River. During this period, the hydrology of the basin would have been closely analogous to modern, shallow Lake Victoria. Fragmentation of the regional drainage network by successive river captures resulted in sequential contractions of the lake to lower elevation shorelines. In turn, resultant decreases in areas of these successive lakes modulated the magnitude of the feedback mechanism. Thus, loss of the Upper Chambeshi catchment caused the lake to drop from the 990 to the 945 m level. Severance of the former link between the Kafue and Zambezi resulted in a further drop to the 936 m shoreline. Inflow declined further after the impoundment of a major lake (Palaeo-Lake Bulozi) on the Upper Zambezi River, causing contraction to the 920 m shoreline. Continued incision of the Zambezi channel into the Chobe horst barrier ultimately terminated input from this river to the Makgadikgadi depression, causing contraction of the lake below 920 m, sustained by the Cuando and Okavango prior to final desiccation. This Regional Drainage Evolution Model contradicts previous proposals that have invoked Late Pleistocene climatic forcing to explain inferred fluctuations in lake levels. The timeframe developed for the drainage reorganizations requires that the lake was initiated by similar to 1.40 to 0.51 Ma at the most recent (Early - Mid-Pleistocene), while archaeological evidence shows that it had contracted below the 936 m shoreline before 500 ka. This contrasts with C-14 and quartz luminescence dates (generally <100 ka), which require that the 945 m lake stage was extant during much of the Upper Pleistocene. The calcareous radiocarbon dates reflect multiple episodes of calcrete formation, while the young luminescence dates are ascribed to the extensive bioturbation of older Kalahari landforms.					; Cotterill, Fenton/A-1326-2009; Eckardt, Frank/N-3682-2015	Cotterill, Fenton/0000-0003-4561-018X; Eckardt, Frank/0000-0003-0200-7110													1012-0750	1996-8590				SEP	2012	115	3					385	413		10.2113/gssajg.115.3.385	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gssajg.115.3.385													WOS:000327576900008
J	Fitzsimons, JD				Fitzsimons, JD			Assessment of lake trout spawning habitat and egg deposition and survival in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					1994 International Conference on Restoration of Lake Trout in the Laurentian Great Lakes (RESTORE)	JAN 10-14, 1994	ANN ARBOR, MI	Great Lake Fishery Commiss, Board Tech Experts				Identification of the amount of lake trout spawning habitat and its actual use by lake trout in Lake Ontario is important for re-establishment of this species. From a combination of hydrographic field data, bathymetry measurements, and video observations, 20 reputed spawning sites, 14 of which were considered to be historically important were evaluated for possible use by lake trout. Based on preliminary evaluations 13 of the 20 sites were rejected for further study because of inappropriate substrate or excessive infilling of interstitial spaces. Additional, more intense evaluations were made of seven sites, five that were of historical importance and two that were man-made. These seven sites had areas of suitable spawning habitat of from 6 to 4,000 m(2), minimal water depths of from 2.2 to 10.8 m, mean cobble diameters of 9.8-20.0 cm, and slopes of 20-45 degrees. Lake trout egg densities, estimated from. recoveries in egg nets deployed in 1992, ranged from a mean of 6 to 6,200 eggs m(-2) and the highest densities were found at man-made sites. The actual egg deposition on the seven sites studied intensely amounted to only 0.0003 to 0.6% of the potential deposition if all the lake trout that survived from stocking within a 30 km radius of each site spawned there. Egg survival to the eyed stage ranged from 21 to 82% and was inversely related to wind fetch. Spawning was earlier in western than in eastern Lake Ontario and was related to the rates of fall cooling. Duration of the spawning period ranged from 1 to 39 days but the low estimates were from collections of only a few eggs. A swim-up mortality syndrome observed in eggs reared in a laboratory was high, ranging from 31.0 to 74.5%. The potential for lake trout restoration in Lake Ontario appears to be limited by a scarcity of good spawning sites, low egg deposition on spawning sites recognized by researchers, and excessive swim-up mortality.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			337	347		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71108-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71108-X													WOS:A1995UL89400031

Sedimentary chydorid (Cladocera) ephippia in relation to lake ecological quality in the Austrian Alps	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Research on chydorid (Crustacea: Cladocera: Chydoridae) reproduction is scarce and very little is known about the dynamics of parthenogenetic (asexual) and gamogenetic (sexual) reproduction modes in these cyclical parthenogens. The paleolimnological approach has a lot to offer to this research since chydorid carapaces (indicative of asexual reproduction) and ephippia (indicative of sexual reproduction) are identifiable in lake sediments. In the current study, we examined historical changes in chydorid reproduction patterns in an Austrian Alpine lake with the objective to explore reproductive shifts under limnological variability and with the hypothesis that sexual reproduction intensifies under unfavourable environmental conditions. For this, we utilised subfossil remains from a sediment sequence covering the past similar to 300 years in a high Alpine lake, lake Oberer Landschitzsee. The results suggested that in-lake processes likely changed as a response to post-Little Ice Age (LIA) climate warming. Indeed, the benthic quality - indicated by the chironomid-based benthic quality index (BQI) - deteriorated, and the productivity - indicated by organic matter in the sediment - increased. The chydorid community exhibited dramatic shifts in the post-LIA section of the core, around 1850-1950 AD, when the two dominant species Alona (A.) affinis and A. quadrangularis were outcompeted by Acroperus harpae, Alonella excisa, and Chydorus (C.) sphaericus-type and their reproduction gradually shifted towards the dominance of sexual reproduction. The community shift and prevalence of sexual reproduction coincided with the period of unfavourable limnological conditions, evidenced by low BQI values and higher organic content. Therefore, we suggest that the intensified sexual reproduction was a local response to deteriorated benthic conditions and a vigorous adaptive mechanism to ensure successful diapause and genetic variability under environmental change. The results give reason to suggest that fossil chydorid assemblages and ephippia indicate the ecological quality of lake ecosystems and, thus, they can be used as additional proxies in future assessments of the lake ecological status.

J	Wendte, J; Uyeno, T				Wendte, J; Uyeno, T			Sequence stratigraphy and evolution of Middle to Upper Devonian Beaverhill Lake strata, south-central Alberta	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Beaverhill Lake strata of late Givetian to early Frasnian age in the subsurface of south-central Alberta consist of shelfal limestones, dolostones and some anhydrites as well as basinal limestones and shales, and range in thickness from 75 to 240 m. These strata were deposited in the Central Alberta Basin and on banks (platforms) or isolated reefs on both sides of the basin. An integrated physical stratigraphic/sedimentological and conodont biostratigraphic study of these strata reveals that Beaverhill Lake strata form most of one overall (first-order) transgressive-regressive (T-R) cycle of sedimentation that also includes coastal plain and marginal marine deposits of the underlying Watt Mountain Formation (conodont zone of Lower subterminus Fauna) and shallow-marine carbonates of the lower part of the overlying Cooking Lake Formation on the east side of the Central Alberta Basin and the lower part of the overlying Leduc Formation on the west side of the basin. This overall T-R cycle consists of two major (second-order) T-R cycles. The lower, second-order cycle extends from the sub-Watt Mountain subaerial unconformity up to a widespread subacrial unconformity (R4 or Upper C) on banks and isolated reefs on both the east and west sides of the Central Alberta Basin and its equivalent, conformable transgressive surface in the basinal succession and includes Beaverhill Lake strata deposited during conodont zone of Upper subterminus Fauna to upper MN2 Zone. The upper, second-order T-R cycle extends from this subaerial unconformity or its basinal equivalent up to the conformable transgressive surface at the top of the Waterways Formation in the Central Alberta Basin or up to an equivalent position in the lower part of the Cooking Lake and Leduc formations on both sides of the basin. Strata in the upper, second-order cycle were deposited from the upper MN2 to MN4 conodont zones. The Beaverhill Lake portion of each of these second-order cycles includes seven third-order sequences, the basic stratigraphic unit of this study. T-R cycles were produced by the interaction of base-level changes, extrabasinal tectonism and depositional controls. The interaction of these controls resulted in different stacking styles of growth on banks and isolated reefs on the east and west sides of the Central Alberta Basin. Areally widespread progradation of carbonate banks on the east side of the basin was directly related to the delivery of argillaceous sediment to the basin from the northeast. The most likely terrigenous source areas were an uplifted portion of the Caledonian orogenic belt, exposed along the east coast of Greenland, or the eastern part of the Franklinian orogenic belt, exposed in the Canadian Arctic islands. The deposition of basinal argillaceous strata in the study area was episodic. The onset of episodes of argillaceous sediment deposition corresponds to transgressive facies shifts and was triggered by increased rates of base-level rise and not to shelfal incision and sediment bypass during intervals of base-level fall. Clay-rich sediment was carried by either surface, or near-surface, marine currents, or by episodic storm-generated currents or episodic storm-generated sediment-gravity flows. The southwesterly transport of this sediment was due to the southeasterly paleo-trade winds or to storm tracks that moved parallel to these winds. During some intervals, this fine terrigenous sediment appreciably infilled portions of the basin proximal to coeval carbonate banks on the east side of the basin. Westerly, leeside shedding of lime mud from these carbonate banks by storm-induced currents resulted in even further infilling of the basin. As a result, these portions of the basin became sufficiently infilled to promote the westerly, leeside bank progradation during intervals of either slower base-level rise or base-level fall. Banks and most isolated reefs on the west side of the Central Alberta Basin were far removed from the entry of clay-rich sediment into the basin. Therefore, portions of the Central Alberta Basin proximal to these banks and isolated reefs were not significantly infilled by coeval argillaccous successions. Lacking appreciable argillaceous sediment infill of these portions of the basin, banks and most isolated reefs on the west side of the Central Alberta Basin prograded basinward only by building out over their own debris and finer bank- or reef-derived sediment. This severely limited the extent of bank or isolated reef progradation. As a consequence, banks and isolated reefs on the west side of the Central Alberta Basin display an overall retreating or backstepping style of growth. The major episodes of isolated reef growth occur at different times on the east and west sides of the Central Alberta Basin and reflect the difference in the prior evolution of carbonate banks in both areas. Trends, inherent in both stratigraphic cross-sections and in cumulative isopach maps, also suggest that most of the micrite in basinal limestones was shed from upslope portions of carbonate ramps, from areas to the northeast of the sub-Cretaceous subcrop unconformity.																			0007-4802					SEP	2005	53	3					250	354		10.2113/53.3.250	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/53.3.250													WOS:000233924100003
J	Houck, KJ; Lockley, MG; Avanzini, M				Houck, Karen J.; Lockley, Martin G.; Avanzini, Marco			A Survey of Tetrapod Tracksites Preserved in Pyroclastic Sediments, with Special Reference to Footprints of Hominids, Other Mammals and Birds	ICHNOS-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PLANT AND ANIMAL TRACES												Pyroclastic sediments provide an unusual and favorable medium for the recording, burial, and preservation of tetrapod tracks and other traces. Twenty-two tracksites were reviewed for the purpose of determining how these deposits contribute to track formation, burial, and preservation. These include Jurassic sites in Argentina and Mexico, Cretaceous sites in Korea, Miocene sites in Mexico and the United States, Pliocene sites in Tanzania, Pleistocene sites in Mexico, Korea, and Italy, and Holocene sites in Mexico, Turkey, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nicaragua, and the United States. Twelve of the sites contain hominid tracks. Tracksites occur most commonly in reworked tephra on the shorelines of rivers, lakes, and seas. They also occur on pyroclastic falls, flows, and surges, and on lahars. Most tracksites are in volcanic arcs, especially around the Pacific Rim. A few occur in continental rifts or near intraplate volcanoes. Most older tracksites (Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Miocene) occur in silicic tephras such as rhyolite and dacite. The younger tracksites are mostly associated with basaltic tephra, though other compositions are also represented. Volcanic eruptions contribute to formation of substrates suitable for recording tracks by producing abundant fine-grained pyroclasts that interact physically and chemically with water to become cohesive. Hiatuses between eruptions provide time for tracks to accumulate, and in some cases, to lithify rapidly. Both physical processes (drying and compaction) and chemical processes (mineral precipitation) appear to be involved in early lithification. Eruptions also contribute to burial of tracks through rapid sedimentation and aggradation that typically follow a pyroclastic eruption. Multiple, closely spaced track horizons are common in pyroclastic sequences. Most tracksites are buried by either fallout tephra or reworked, waterlain deposits. Others are buried by lahars, pyroclastic flows and surges, or windblown ash. Upon exhumation pyroclastic deposits contribute to the formation of bedding planes through clay drapes, friable ash layers, and biotite-rich layers. Precipitation of authigenic minerals contributes to erosional resistance within beds. Bedding plane formation and erosional resistance facilitate discovery and study of tracks.																			1042-0940	1563-5236					2009	16	1-2					76	97	PII 907759636	10.1080/10420940802470870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10420940802470870													WOS:000262472700008
J	Yang, J; Yu, XQ; Liu, LM; Zhang, WJ; Guo, PY				Yang, Jun; Yu, Xiaoqing; Liu, Lemian; Zhang, Wenjing; Guo, Peiyong			Algae community and trophic state of subtropical reservoirs in southeast Fujian, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Background, aim, and scope Fujian reservoirs in southeast China are important water resources for economic and social sustainable development, although few have been studied previously. In recent years, growing population and increasing demands for water shifted the focus of many reservoirs from flood control and irrigation water to drinking water. However, most of them showed a rapid increase in the level of eutrophication, which is one of the most serious and challenging environmental problems. In this study, we investigated the algae community characteristics, trophic state, and eutrophication control strategies for typical subtropical reservoirs in southeast Fujian. Materials and methods Surface water samples were collected using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic bottles from 11 Fujian reservoirs in summer 2010. Planktonic algae were investigated by optical microscopy. Water properties were determined according to the national standard methods. Results and discussion Shallow reservoirs generally have higher values of trophic state index (TSI) and appear to be more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance than deeper reservoirs. A total of 129 taxa belonging to eight phyla (i.e., Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta, Cryptophyta, Cyanophyta, Euglenophyta, Pyrrophyta, Xanthophyta) were observed and the most diverse groups were Chlorophyta (52 taxa), Cyanophyta (20 taxa), Euglenophyta (17 taxa), Chrysophyta (14 taxa). The dominant groups were Chlorophyta (40.58%), Cyanophyta (22.91%), Bacillariophyta (21.61%), Chrysophyta (6.91%). The species richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness of algae varied significantly between reservoirs. TSI results indicated that all 11 reservoirs were eutrophic, three of them were hypereutrophic, six were middle eutrophic, and two were light eutrophic. There was a strong positive correlation between algal diversity and TSI at P < 0.05. Our canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) results illustrated that temperature, transparency, conductivity, DO, TC, NH4-N, NO (x) -N, TP, and chlorophyll a were significant environmental variables affecting the distribution of algae communities. The transparency and chlorophyll a were the strongest environmental factors in explaining the community data. Furthermore, the degradation of water quality associated with excess levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in Fujian reservoirs may be impacted by interactions among agriculture and urban factors. A watershed-based management strategy, especially phosphorus control, should be developed for drinking water source protection and sustainable reservoirs in the future. Conclusion and recommendations All investigated reservoirs were eutrophicated based on the comprehensive TSI values; thus, our results provided an early warning of water degradation in Fujian reservoirs. Furthermore, the trophic state plays an important role in shaping community structure and in determining species diversity of algae. Therefore, long-term and regular monitoring of Euglenophyta, Cyanophyta, TN, TP and chlorophyll a in reservoirs is urgently needed to further understand the future trend of eutrophication and to develop a watershed-based strategy to manage the Cyanophyta bloom hazards.					; Yu, Xiaoqing/E-2388-2013; Liu, Lemian/AGP-9346-2022; YANG, Jun/E-6680-2011; Yang, Jun/E-6680-2011; Zhang, Wenjing/H-5057-2012	Zhang, Wenjing/0000-0002-2600-5040; YANG, Jun/0000-0002-7920-2777; Liu, Lemian/0000-0002-8977-6969													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2012	19	5					1432	1442		10.1007/s11356-011-0683-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0683-1								22743992					WOS:000305884600010
J	Brosse, S; Gabas, S; Cever, K; Lek, S				Brosse, S; Gabas, S; Cever, K; Lek, S			Comparison of two point abundance sampling methods to assess young roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) microhabitat in the littoral zone of lake Pareloup (France)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												One of the most frequently used sampling methods used in defining fish microhabitat is the Point Abundance Sampling by Electrofishing (PASE) technique. Nevertheless this method is size-selective and induces escapement behaviour in most fish species. The aim of this study is first to describe a direct visual fish observation method, the Point Abundance Sampling by Scuba diving (PASS), and second, to compare this method with the classical PASE to determine 0+ (i.e. young of the year) roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) microhabitat in the littoral zone of a mesotrophic lake. The study was undertaken during summer 1998 in lake Pareloup (south-west France). Sampling was performed weekly in two restricted littoral areas of the lake which presented the same environmental and topographical characteristics aiming to compare 0+ roach habitat features obtained using the two sampling techniques (PASE and PASS). The two data matrices obtained (i.e. PASE and PASS) were used to develop microhabitat preference indices for each of the 9 variables as a measurement of habitat use by the 0+ roach vs. habitat availability. Even though 0+ roach occurrence and abundance were found to be similar with both methods, microhabitat profiles revealed different patterns. A significant microhabitat difference between the two sampling methods was found using the non-parametric statistical test of Wilcoxon (Z = -4.20, p < 0.01). We can hypothesise that the differences observed between the two sampling designs were due to an escapement behaviour of 0+ roach. Unlike PASS, using PASE, fish are located in "shelter habitats" such as shallow water and dense vegetation. Such behaviour is caused by the environmental disturbance induced by this sampling method. The study reveals that PASS appears to be more suitable than PASE for the assessment 0+ fish microhabitat.					; Brosse, Sebastien/AAC-4689-2019	Brosse, Sebastien/0000-0002-3659-8177; 													0003-4088						1999	35	3					199	204		10.1051/limn/1999028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1999028													WOS:000082941000007

We present a high-resolution elemental data set, spanning the past 9,000 years, obtained using in-situ synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence measurements of a lake sediment core from Lake Shuang in the Altai Mountains. Based on calibration against the local instrumental climatic record, the Rb/Sr ratio of the sediments is interpreted as an indicator of weathering intensity, which is related to precipitation and temperature variations. There is very little bromine in the granites and moyites in the catchment of Lake Shuang, and the sedimentary Br is derived primarily from wet deposition originating from precipitation and enriched by biogenic processes in this open lake system. The Br variation is positively correlated with local precipitation. The Rb/Sr and Br time series show distinct decadal-scale to millennial-scale cycles that are similar to those of Arctic sea-ice variations, which implies the important role of Artic sea ice in modulating environmental change at Lake Shuang. Our results support a previous suggestion that sea ice loss would cause an increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic, resulting in the frequent incursion of cold air masses from the Arctic into middle latitudes, and leading to increased snow cover and precipitation, and vice versa. Plain Language Summary Cyclical and abrupt paleoclimatic events in the Holocene are often linked with Arctic amplification in which atmospheric changes induced by variations in solar radiation are amplified and transmitted globally via the impact of sea ice on ocean-atmosphere circulation patterns. However, a few of high-resolution regional paleoclimatic records from midlatitudes have been used to evaluate and verify this link on longer time scales. Here, we present high-resolution elemental data from the sediments of a lake in the Altai Mountains. The results show distinct decadal-scale to millennial-scale cycles that are similar to those of Arctic sea-ice variations, which implies the important role of Artic sea ice in modulating environmental change at Lake Shuang.

J	van Eerden, MR; Lenselink, G; Zijlstra, M				van Eerden, Mennobart R.; Lenselink, Gerda; Zijlstra, Menno			Long-term changes in wetland area and composition in The Netherlands affecting the carrying capacity for wintering waterbirds	ARDEA												In The Netherlands, arising in geological time as the delta of the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt, a considerable change in landscape occurred during the Holocene period due to sea level rise. In more recent times this change was dramatically enforced by human actions. This started with the opening up of the large woods on higher soils, some 4500 years BP. It is estimated that the country was only populated then by a few thousand people. During the next 2000 years, the extensive forest clearing continued, and up to approximately 60% of the upland area changed into grazed woodland. Over-exploitation during the Middle Ages resulted in extended heathlands, which covered up to 40% of the total area of upland sands by 1500 AD. Today woodlands cover only 1 promille of the surface area it covered 7000 years ago. Wetlands remained undisturbed for a long period, but they have become seriously affected since the late Middle Ages; the construction of dikes, embankments and drainage have caused the area of wetlands to shrink dramatically. Especially when in the 19th and 20th centuries, as a result of the introduction of steam and later diesel and electric engines, large-scale projects could be realised. This led to the disappearance of many freshwater lakes and the almost complete loss of the area of brackish water, the natural link between sea water and freshwater. Although the influence of Man upon the Dutch landscape commenced some 4500 years ago, it is only during the last 600 years that wetlands have been affected. Particularly the last 100 years have been crucial with respect to drainage and cultivation. By reconstructing ancient landscapes, an attempt has been made to describe the species composition and numerical abundance of waterbirds, starting 7000 years BP. Two species have become extinct in the territory, many others show changes in abundance. The start of agriculture has caused a major change in the food provisioning of many herbivorous waterbirds. Over the last 7000 years, a sevenfold increase of the number of herbivorous waterfowl is estimated. On the other hand the number of fish-eaters, benthos-eaters and planktivorous waterbirds has declined, their available habitat now having diminished by 45%, 36% and 55% respectively with respect to the Late Subatlantic period, c. 850-1350 AD.																			0373-2266						2010	98	3					265	282		10.5253/078.098.0302	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/078.098.0302													WOS:000286546300002
J	Lorenz, RD; Hayes, AG				Lorenz, Ralph D.; Hayes, Alexander G.			The growth of wind-waves in Titan's hydrocarbon seas	ICARUS												Ocean wave growth on Titan is considered. The classic Sverdrup-Munk theory for terrestrial wave growth is applied to Titan, and is compared with a simple energy balance model that exposes the effect of Titan's environmental parameters (air density, gravity, and fluid density). These approaches are compared with the only previously-published (semi-empirical) model (Ghafoor, N.A.-L., Zarnecki, J.C., Challenor, P., Srokosz, M.A. [2000] J. Geophys. Res. 105, 12,077-12,091, hereafter G2k), and allow the impact of various parameters such as atmospheric density to be transparently explored. Our model, like G2k, suggests fully-developed significant wave heights on Titan H-s = 0.2 U-2, where U is the windspeed (SI units): in dimensionless terms this is rather close to H-s = 0.2 U-2/g, a rule of thumb previously noted for terrestrial waves (we find various datasets where the prefactor varies by similar to 2). It is noted that liquid and air densities affect the growth rate of waves, but not their fully-developed height: for 1 m/s winds wave amplitude reaches 0.15 m (75% of fully-developed) with a fetch of only 1 km, rather faster than predicted by G2k. Liquid viscosity has no major effect on gravity wave growth, but does influence the threshold windspeed at which gravity-capillary waves form in the first place. The model is used to develop predicted ranges for wave height to guide the design of the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME), a proposed Discovery-class mission to float a capsule on Ligeia Mare in 2023. For the expected maximum 1 m/s winds, a significant wave height of 0.2 m and wavelength of similar to 4 m can be expected. Assuming that wave heights follow Rayleigh statistics as they do on Earth, then given the wave period of similar to 4 s, individual waves of similar to 0.6 m might be encountered over a 3 month period. For predicted Titan winds at Kraken Mare, significant wave heights may reach similar to 0.6 m in the peak of summer but do not exceed the tidal amplitude at its northern end, consistent with the area around Mayda Insula being a tidal flat, while elsewhere on Kraken and Ligeia and at Ontario Lacus, shorelines may be wave- or tidally-dominated, depending on the specific location.

Using groundwater age and hydrochemistry to understand sources and dynamics of nutrient contamination through the catchment into Lake Rotorua, New Zealand	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The water quality of Lake Rotorua has steadily declined over the past 50 years despite mitigation efforts over recent decades. Delayed response of the groundwater discharges to historic land- use intensification 50 years ago was the reason suggested by early tritium measurements, which indicated large transit times through the groundwater system. We use the isotopic and chemistry signature of the groundwater for detailed understanding of the origin, fate, flow pathways, lag times and future loads of contaminants. A unique set of high- quality tritium data over more than four decades, encompassing the time when the tritium spike from nuclear weapons testing moved through the groundwater system, allows us to determine detailed age distribution parameters of the water discharging into Lake Rotorua. The Rotorua volcanic groundwater system is complicated due to the highly complex geology that has evolved through volcanic activity. Vertical and steeply inclined geological contacts preclude a simple flow model. The extent of the Lake Rotorua groundwater catchment is difficult to establish due to the deep water table in large areas, combined with inhomogeneous groundwater flow patterns. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the water chemistry parameters provided evidence of the recharge source of the large springs near the lake shore, with discharge from the Mamaku ignimbrite through lake sediment layers. Groundwater chemistry and age data show clearly the source of nutrients that cause lake eutrophication, nitrate from agricultural activities and phosphate from geologic sources. With a naturally high phosphate load reaching the lake continuously via all streams, the only effective way to limit algae blooms and improve lake water quality in such environments is by limiting the nitrate load. The groundwater in the Rotorua catchment, once it has passed through the soil zone, shows no further decrease in dissolved oxygen, indicating an absence of bioavailable electron donors along flow paths that could facilitate microbial denitrification reactions. Nitrate from land- use activities that leaches out of the root zone of agricultural land into the deeper part of the groundwater system must be expected to travel with the groundwater to the lake. The old age and the highly mixed nature of the water discharges imply a very slow and lagged response of the streams and the lake to anthropogenic contaminants in the catchment, such as nitrate. Using the age distribution as deduced from tritium time series data measured in the stream discharges into the lake allows prediction of future nutrient loads from historic land- use activities 50 years ago. For Hamurana Stream, the largest stream to Lake Rotorua, it takes more than a hundred years for the groundwaterdominated stream discharge to adjust to changes in landuse activities. About half of the currently discharging water is still pristine old water, and after this old water is completely displaced by water affected by land use, the nitrogen load of Hamurana Stream will approximately double. These timescales apply to activities that cause contamination, but also to remediation action.					; Leonard, Graham/B-5617-2012; Daughney, Chris/AAJ-4081-2021	Gordon, Dougall/0000-0002-2494-2575; Leonard, Graham/0000-0002-4859-0180; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2015	19	2					803	822		10.5194/hess-19-803-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-803-2015													WOS:000350557400010

To establish noble gas temperatures (NGTs) also for stalagmites grown in cold regions, we applied the CVCS system to samples from stalagmite M2 precipitated in the Milandre Cave, located in the Swiss Jura Mountains. The investigated stalagmite M2 covers the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Holocene transitions. Noble gas temperatures are determined by using a new algorithm based on noble gas and water abundances and not from concentrations. Noble gas results indicate annual mean temperatures in the Milandre Cave were 2.2 +/- 1.8 degrees C during the late stages of the Allerod, then dropping to 0 (+)((-)) 26 degrees C at the onset of the Younger Dryas. Such temperatures indicate conditions near to the freezing point of water during the first part of the Younger Dryas. During the last part of the Younger Dryas, the temperature increased to 6.3 +/- 2.3 degrees C. No early Holocene temperature could be determined due the non-detectable water abundances in these samples, however one late Holocene sample indicates a cave temperature of 8.7 +/- 2.7 degrees C which is close to the present day annual mean temperature. NGTs estimated for the Allerod-Younger Dryas-Holocene are in good agreement with paleo-temperature reconstructions from geochemical and biological proxies in lake sediments. The observed deviations between the different paleo-temperature reconstructions are minor if the according temperatures are rescaled to annual mean temperatures and are primarily attributed to the chronological tuning of the different records. As in other stalagmites, NGT reconstructions of the recently precipitated stalagmite ('young') samples again are biased, most likely due to diffusive gas loss during sample processing. We speculate that a reduced retentivity of noble gases during experimental sample processing is a general feature of recently precipitated stalagmite fabrics. Therefore, the recently precipitated stalagmite samples do not allow the reliable NGT determination given the currently available experimental methods. Nevertheless, this study makes the case that noble gas thermometry can be applied to stalagmites for paleo-temperature reconstruction based on a physical method including stalagmites that grew during cold climatic conditions.

Numerous shallow to ephemeral saline lakes and dry saline pans are present on the Qarhan Salt Plain. Dabusun Lake, the largest (about 200 km(2)), contains high salinity Na-Mg-Cl brines. Whereas it precipitates halite, it is fringed by a potash salt flat. The dominant inflow to Dabusun Lake, the Golmud River, contains dilute Na+-HCO3--rich meteoric waters. Dabusun Lake brines fall on an evaporation trend given by delta D (parts per thousand) = 3.3 delta(18)O-43. Both delta D and delta(18)O values increase with salinity which in turn varies considerably with flooding and evaporation. The isotope compositions of the fluid inclusion brines from modern halite formed along the lake's edge are intermediate to those of Dabusun Lake brines and those from the salt flat. Shallow sediments beneath Qarhan consist of interbedded salts and mud. A. short core section (1.3-1.7 m depth) from the northern edge of Dabusun Lake, was found to contain three dissolution surfaces and three mud partings. The delta(18)O values for fluid inclusions in 22 primary halite samples from this section show a record of episodic flooding (lower delta(18)O values) followed by evaporation (gradual increase in delta(18)O values). Primary fluid inclusions in halite crystallized initially at the surface provide a geochemical record of surface brines. Their major element compositions varied through time. More concentrated fluids indicate more arid conditions in the basin, whereas wetter conditions prevailed during intervals of non-salt deposition when laminated muds accumulated. The isotope compositions together with the activity of H2O of fluid inclusions in primary halite were used to determine isotope variations in regional precipitation and hence paleoclimatic changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during the past 50,000 years.																			0031-0182					SEP	1995	117	3-4					279	290		10.1016/0031-0182(94)00126-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)00126-S													WOS:A1995RZ30900006

Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS		Sedimentary constraints on late Quaternary lake-level fluctuations at Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho	PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF BEAR LAKE, UTAH AND IDAHO, AND ITS CATCHMENT	Geological Society of America Special Papers											A variety of sedimentological evidence was used to construct the lake-level history for Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho, for the past similar to 25,000 years. Shorelines provide evidence of precise lake levels, but they are infrequently preserved and are poorly dated. For cored sediment similar to that in the modern lake, grain-size distributions provide estimates of past lake depths. Sedimentary textures provide a highly sensitive, continuous record of lake-level changes, but the modern distribution of fabrics is poorly constrained, and many ancient features have no modern analog. Combining the three types of data yields a more robust lake-level history than can be obtained from any one type alone. When smooth age-depth models are used, lake-level curves from multiple cores contain inconsistent intervals (i.e., one record indicates a rising lake level while another record indicates a falling lake level). These discrepancies were removed and the multiple records were combined into a single lake-level curve by developing age-depth relations that contain changes in deposition rate ( i. e., gaps) where indicated by sedimentological evidence. The resultant curve shows that, prior to 18 ka, lake level was stable near the modern level, probably because the lake was overflowing. Between ca. 17.5 and 15.5 ka, lake level was similar to 40 m below the modern level, then fluctuated rapidly throughout the post-glacial interval. Following a brief rise centered ca. 15 ka (= Raspberry Square phase), lake level lowered again to 15-20 m below modern from ca. 14.8-11.8 ka. This regression culminated in a lowstand to 40 m below modern ca. 12.5 ka, before a rapid rise to levels above modern ca. 11.5 ka. Lake level was typically lower than present throughout the Holocene, with pronounced lowstands 15-20 m below the modern level ca. 10-9, 7.0, 6.5-4.5, 3.5, 3.0-2.5, 2.0, and 1.5 ka. High lake levels near or above the modern lake occurred ca. 8.5-8.0, 7.0-6.5, 4.5-3.5, 2.5, and 0.7 ka. This lake-level history is more similar to records from Pyramid Lake, Nevada, and Owens Lake, California, than to those from Lake Bonneville, Utah.

In contrast, inland alluvial valleys formed in response to climatic, tectonic, and intrinsic events of varied magnitude and duration. Sequence boundaries and architecture reflect a variety of causes, typically mediated through changes in the river's equilibrium profile and equilibrium floodplain height. We evaluate valley and sequence models using Quaternary examples from southern Asia and Australia. For these areas, proxy records are well established for climate and sea level, but the scarcity of records for tectonic activity and intrinsic channel changes hamper an interpretation of stratigraphic events. On the large alluvial plains of northern India and central Australia, climatic changes have radically affected sediment and water discharge on timescales as short as 10(3) to 10(4) years. Periods of incision and aggradation generate discontinuity-bounded sequences (aggradational-degradational rhythms), and reaches may vary between valley and channel morphology over short periods and distances. Across Asia, changes in monsoonal precipitation have caused near-synchronous incision and aggradation in varied tectonic settings. However, mature interfluve paleosols correlative with valley bases may be local or absent on these large plains, where small interfluve channels, eolian dunes, and lakes aggrade while mainstem valleys incise. Gullied floodplains, adjacent to valleys and tributaries, and terrace deposits are useful indicators of incised systems. Climatic effects appear to be underrepresented in interpretations of ancient alluvial sequences in general. Angular unconformities, channel diversion, and incised and tilted fans near major faults reflect tectonic controls on architecture, and soft-sediment deformation and rare surface ruptures testify to earthquake events. In smaller basins such as the Rio Grande Rift of southwestern USA, alluvial architecture reflects both tectonic and climatic controls. Channel-body amalgamation may not be a good proxy for tectonically induced subsidence, especially for megafans at upland exits where a low degree of amalgamation may reflect rapid accumulation rather than rapid subsidence and accommodation creation. Multistory valleys and extensive multistory and single-story sheets are present in inland and coastal alluvial areas. However, below the Australian continental shelf, seismic profiles identify entrenched channels and channel belts rather than the valley fills that are commonly assumed to form under such conditions. This example shows that sea-level fall and river extensions need not generate deeply incised fluvial valleys in coastal settings.

J	Malinen, T; Peltonen, H				Malinen, T; Peltonen, H			Optimal sampling and traditional versus model-based data analysis in acoustic fish stock assessment in Lake Vesijarvi	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Optimal sampling strategy and data analysis methods were studied for pelagic fish stock assessment in eutrophic Lake Vesijarvi in southern Finland based on 10 surveys conducted in 1993. The systematic sampling scheme was applied with parallel transects. The precision of the fish density estimates in unstratified and post-stratified sampling were compared with each other and with the precision that could be obtained by an optimum effort allocation. Because the frequency distribution of fish density in the primary sampling units is typically skewed, a model-based estimation was also applied in which the distribution is approximated with a known distribution. The best normalizing transformation was found with Box's and Cox's test. These model-based estimates were compared with the estimates derived from non-transformed data. Post-stratified sampling by depth areas produced more precise estimates than unstratified sampling (reduction in the variances about 40%), reduced the bias caused by spatial autocorrelation and eliminated the bias caused by unproportional sampling of depth areas. The most precise estimates (reduction in the variances compared with post-stratification about 50%) would be given by optimum allocation, which suggests that more effort should be allocated to the deep areas. The optimal fraction of sample size to deep areas increased in the course of the summer (about 20% in June and over 50% in August). The model-based estimation produced a slight gain in precision with the post-stratified data. But, surprisingly, with unstratified data and with optimum allocation more precise estimates were given by initial untransformed data. In conclusion, we do not recommend the model-based estimation (including logarithmic transformation) in lakes if a suitable survey time is restricted by fish behaviour (diel migrations, schooling behaviour), because of difficulties in obtaining adequate sample size to determine appropriate transformation.																			0165-7836					MAY	1996	26	3-4					295	308		10.1016/0165-7836(95)00423-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(95)00423-8													WOS:A1996UL16800007

The fossiliferous site contains three bone-bearing horizons. Mammal remains are rare in the upper level and they were not found during the 2014 excavation. The middle and lower levels yielded exclusively remains of the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius. The middle level (stratigraphic layer 5) is a result of an in situ accumulation in alluvial sediments. At least three individuals are identified: a juvenile (< 6-10 years old in AEY) of 1.8 m shoulder height and weighing 1 ton; a young adult (ca. 24 years old in AEY) and an old mammoth (> 43 years old in AEY) of 2.9 m of shoulder height and 3.8 t. Their remains were buried in conditions similar to those of a floodplain scroll/natural levee or an islet. Bones stayed on the subsurface for a long time, allowing thus carnivores to reach them easily. The lower level (stratigraphic layer 6) is composed of at least four animals: two juveniles (< 6-10 years old in AEY) and two adults (> 11-13 years old in AEY). The material only enables to determine that one juvenile is 1.5 m at shoulder height and weighs ca. 610 kg, while a young adult should have a body mass of ca. 1,600 kg. No human artefacts or any cut-marks on bones were found in either of these two levels during the 2014 excavation. However, the excavations carried out during the years 2007 to 2010 had allowed the discovery of Palaeolithic artefacts in the lower level, which was formed in alluvial-lacustrine conditions. This indicates that humans had visited this a priori in situ mammoth assemblage. It is likely that at the beginning of spring, the oxbow lake had trapped woolly mammoths. Humans and carnivores had then sorted out and taken away any useful remains. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the mammoth died at the early phase of the Last Glacial Maximum, at about C-14 -20 000 BP (similar to 24 000 years cal BP). Isotopic analyses of the collagen from the mammoth remains argue that the animal was living at the time in a steppe landscape, which was dominated by grass-like vegetation.

J	Tang, EPY; Vincent, WF				Tang, EPY; Vincent, WF			Effects of daylength and temperature on the growth and photosynthesis of an Arctic cyanobacterium, Schizothrix calcicola (Oscillatoriaceae)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Cyanobacteria are often the dominant phototrophs in high-latitude lakes and streams where they must experience continuously low temperature and extreme variations in daylength. The present study examined the interaction between these two variables for the growth and physiology of an Arctic isolate of the mat-forming species Schizothrix calcicola (Agardh) Gomont. Growth rates (mu), photosynthesis (P), respiration (R), pigment composition and in vivo absorption characteristics were measured under 15 combinations of daylengths (8:16, 12:12, 16:8, 20:4 and 24:0 L/D) and temperatures (5, 15 and 25 degreesC). mu increased with increasing temperature (mu (max) at 5 degreesC = 0.12 d(-1), mu (max) at 25 degreesC = 0.28 d(-1)) and a similar trend was observed in photosynthetic capacity (average P-max(B) at 5 degreesC = 4.42 mg C (mg Chl a)(-1) h(-1), average P-max(B) at 25 degreesC = 5.74 mg C (mg Chl a)(-1) h(-1)), pigment content and absorbance. Daylength had a positive effect on mu and pigment absorption, but not pigment content. The shape of the mu -daylength curve varied with temperature: mu was a linear function of daylength at 5 degreesC, but at 15 and 25 degreesC the relationship resembled a rectangular hyperbola and mu saturated at 16:8 and 12:12 L/D, respectively. The non-linear relationship between mu and daylength at high temperature was related to a reduction in net photosynthesis under extended daylength; at 25 degreesC, net P under 24:0 L/D was 0.82+/-0.37 mg O-2 (mg Chl a)(-1) h(-1), while under 8:16 L/D, it was 6.54+/-0.69 mg O-2 (mg Chl n)(-1) h(-1). The constant increase in growth with increasing daylength at low temperature may reflect an adaptive tolerance to the combination of cold temperature and continuous daylight during the Arctic summer.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0967-0262	1469-4433				AUG	2000	35	3					263	272		10.1017/S0967026200002808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0967026200002808													WOS:000165117300006

During 2006-2012, 272 macrozoobenthic samples were collected from the littoral and sublittoral zones of the lake. A total of 66 species were identified in the collected samples. In 2006-2009, the number of species increased from the upper to the lower reaches of the lake, with all 66 species recorded in the latter. However, with increasing salinity and decreasing dissolved oxygen content, the total number of macrozoobenthic species dropped up to 12 in 2012, with the highest number observed at the lower reaches. The average annual macrozoobenthic abundance and biomass in the littoral zone (836 +/- 33.08 ind. m(-2) and 19.7 +/- 0.78 g m(-2), respectively) were comparable to those in the sublittoral zone (879 +/- 35.16 ind. m(-2) and 9.19 +/- 0.36 g m(-2), respectively). In summer 2012, during the period of maximum development, the macrozoobenthic abundance and biomass in the littoral zone were 346 ind. m(-2) and 3.26 g m(-2), respectively. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index reached 3.26 bits ind-1 in the littoral zone in 2006-2008 and then decreased to 2.34 bits ind(-1) in 2010-2012. The Pielou evenness indices during these periods were 0.66 and 0.61, respectively. In August 2009-2012, the correlation coefficient between salinity and macrozoobenthic abundance was -0.97. In July 2006-2012, the correlation coefficient between dissolved oxygen content and macrozoobenthic biomass was 0.89, whereas that between dissolved oxygen content and macrozoobenthic species number was 0.95. Results of the correlation and multiple regression analyses revealed the key role of oxygen depletion in decreasing the macrozoobenthic species richness and its development. Principal component analysis indicated that the first two principal components, related to transparency, oxygen, salinity, and temperature, explained most of the total variance of the data. Transparency, oxygen, and temperature positively influenced the macrozoobenthic species composition and quantitative characteristics, whereas salinity exerted a negative influence.

J	Thorpe, SA; Ozen, B				Thorpe, S. A.; Ozen, B.			Are cascading flows stable?	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS												The stability of flows cascading down slopes as dense inclined plumes is examined, with particular reference to flows observed in Lake Geneva during winter periods of severe cooling. A previous conjecture by Turner that the flow may be in a state of marginal stability is confirmed: the observed mean velocity and density profiles are unstable to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but only marginally so; the growth rates of the most unstable small disturbances to the cascading flow in Lake Geneva are small, with e-folding periods of about 2h. A reduction in the maximum velocity by about 20% is required to stabilize the flow. The possibility that stationary hydraulic jumps may occur in the observed flow is also considered. Several plausible flow states downstream of transitions are examined, allowing for mixing and density changes to occur, ranging from one that preserves the shape of the density and velocity profiles to one in which, as a consequence of mixing, the velocity and density become uniform in depth within the cascading flow. Neither of these extreme states is found to conserve the fluxes of volume, mass and momentum through a transition in which the energy flux does not increase, and to be unique or 'stable' in the sense that no further transition is possible to a similar flow state without more entrainment. Stable transitions to intermediate downstream flows that conserve flow properties and reduce energy flux are, however, found, although the smallest value of the flow parameter, Fr = U-max(2)/g Delta h (where U-max is the maximum flow speed, g is the acceleration due to gravity, Delta is a fractional density difference within the flow and h is the flow thickness) at which transitions may occur is only slightly less than that of the cascading flow in Lake Geneva. In this sense, the observed flow is marginally unstable to a finite-amplitude transition or hydraulic jump. Velocity and density profiles of possible flows downstream of a transition are found. The amplitudes of possible transitions and the flux of water entrained from the ambient overlying water mass are limited to narrow ranges.																			0022-1120	1469-7645				OCT 25	2007	589						411	432		10.1017/S0022112007007902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112007007902													WOS:000250931300017
J	JONES, JG; SIMON, BM; GARDENER, S				JONES, JG; SIMON, BM; GARDENER, S			FACTORS AFFECTING METHANOGENESIS AND ASSOCIATED ANAEROBIC PROCESSES IN THE SEDIMENTS OF A STRATIFIED EUTROPHIC LAKE	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY												Factors affecting methanogenesis in the sediments of a eutrophic lake were studied during late summer, a period during which CH4 gas production slowed down dramatically or stopped completely. The most active methanogenesis occurred in the surface sediments and the temperature optimum for the process in these deeper sediments was 30.degree. C. Addition of H2 or formic acid to sediment slurries stimulated CH4 production to a greater extent than did acetic or pyruvic acid. Analysis of the kinetics of the conversion of H2 to CH4 suggested that the sediments were severely limited in H2, the concentration being considerably less than 2.5 .mu.mol l-1, the Km for the process. Methanogenesis was not stimulated by the addition of trace quantities of Ni2+, CO2+, MoO42- or Fe2+ ions but was inhibited by 0.5 mmol SO42- l-1. Under natural conditions the sediments were also limited in SO42- and sulfate reducers acted as net H2 donors to the methanogens; addition of SO42- allowed the sulfate reducers to compete effectively for H2. The addition of 20 mmol Na2MoO4 l-1 to sediments inhibited methanogenesis but this was not due entirely to its effect in the H2 transfer from sulfate reducers; it also inhibited CO2 uptake by sediments and the production of CH4 from CH3COOH and CO2 by cultures of methanogens. It is inadvisable to use MoO42- at this concentration as a specific inhibition of sulfate reducers in such freshwater sediments. Experiments with other inhibitors or methanogens suggested that they may interact with sulfate reducers, acetogens or anaerobic bacteria involved fatty acid decomposition. Small, sealed sediment cores, which were used to reproduce natural conditions, particularly of available H2 concentration, were injected with trace quantities of H14CO3- and 14CH3COOH. The results suggested that more than 75% of the CH4 was derived from CO2 and the remainder from CH3COOH. The overall rates of methanogenesis in the small cores agreed well with results from the field.																			0022-1287						1982	128	JAN					1	11																WOS:A1982NC74000001
J	Sadek, MF; Shahin, MM; Stigter, CJ				Sadek, MF; Shahin, MM; Stigter, CJ			Evaporation from the reservoir of the High Aswan Dam, Egypt: A new comparison of relevant methods with limited data	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Previous estimates of average annual evaporation from the lake formed by the High Dam at Aswan, Egypt, fall in the range from 4.65 mm d(-1) to 7.95 mm d(-1). The difference between these limits, more than 7 billion m(3) yr(-1) at the highest storage level, is nearly one-eighth the share by treaty of Egypt, and more than one-third of the share of the Sudan. It is also more than the estimated increase of the annual water need for Egypt between 1990 and 2000. This state of affairs renders proper management of the river flow for the sake of Egypt and the Sudan quite difficult. This paper compares the relevant methods of estimating evaporation from the limited data available. These methods are: water-balance, energy budget, bulk aerodynamic (Dalton), combination (Penman) and Complementary Relations Lake Evaporation (CRLE) model (Morton). The new estimates have a much narrower range, from 5.70 mmd(-1) to 7.05 mmd(-1), or only a bit more than 4% of the annual Nile flow below the High Aswan Dam. The average of these annual estimates of evaporation, after excluding the bulk aerodynamic method because of its severe limitations, is 6.0+/-0.3 mmd(-1) or 20% less than the 7.5 mmd(-1) adopted by the irrigation authorities in Egypt and the Sudan. This difference corresponds to 3 billion m(3) yr(-1) at the highest storage level or more than 5% of the annual outflow from the reservoir. Even when the higher estimates from the bulk aerodynamic method and from the Penman method with its usual wind function are included, the new average is still 15% less than the figure of 7.5 mmd(-1). The monthly distribution of the annual evaporation varies more widely with the method applied. Similar comparative studies in future, aiming at obtaining improved estimates of evaporation, require all the data relevant to all the methods to be collected properly for a common period of several years at relatively stable lake level.

J	KEPPER, JC				KEPPER, JC			SEDIMENTOLOGY OF A MIDDLE CAMBRIAN OUTER SHELF MARGIN WITH EVIDENCE FOR SYNDEPOSITIONAL FAULTING, EASTERN CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN NEVADA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												The Middle to Upper Cambrian Emigrant Formation at Horse Thief Canyon, California, is a transitional section between the outer shelf Bonanza King Formation and the basin facies represented by the Emigrant Formation in Nevada. At Horse Thief Canyon the Emigrant is subdivided into 4 members: the Limestone-Siltstone Member, the Papoose Lake tongue, the Megabreccia Member and the Limestone-Chert Member. For a portion of Middle Cambrian time the shelf structure was that of a ramp. Bedded and burrowed pelletal dolostones were deposited in the deeper waters of the outer shelf. Sediment for the outer shelf may have been derived from a mid-shelf shallow subtidal to peritidal zone. Cycle patterns of burrowed and bedded dolostones are probably related to periods of little sediment input accompanied by intense burrowing of the bottom followed by periods of heightened current activity and bedded dolostone deposition. Later in the Middle Cambrian the shelf structure changed to a platform. Megabreccia and breccia representing debris flow deposits and interbedded allodapic calcarenite and calcisiltite are evidence for the existence of a significant slope between shelf and basin. This slope may have been caused by syndepositional faulting and collapse of a portion of the outer shelf. The fault hypothesis is based on a rust-colored marker unit recognized in the Emigrant at Horse Thief Canyon and in the outer shelf Bonanze King section 13 km to the south along with the presence of distinctive algal boundstone clasts in the Megabreccia Member. The megabreccia beds lie above the marker unit but all known source rocks for the algal boundstone occur stratigraphically well below the marker. Uncertainty regarding the syndepositional fault hypothesis centers on whether the Horse Thief and Last Change Range sections are in the same or different allocthons. [Middle Cambrian trilobites belonging to the Ehmaniella fauna (Bathyuriscus-Elrathina Assemblage Zone) have been collected from these sandstones in The Nopah Range in California and in the Spring Mountains near Las Vegas, Nevada.].																			0022-4472						1981	51	3					807	821																WOS:A1981MK02300013

Gap-, stand-, and landscape-scale factors contribute to poor sugar maple regeneration after timber harvest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Natural regeneration in canopy gaps is a key process affecting long-term dynamics of many forests, including northern hardwood forests. The density and composition of regenerating trees are often highly variable, reflecting sensitivity to a suite of driving factors operating at different scales (e.g., harvest gap to regional landscape), including production of seeds, physical characteristics of gaps and stands, competition with non-tree vegetation, and browsing by animals. Multivariate analyses over broad geographic areas provide insights into the relative effects of these factors and permit exploration of spatial patterns in regeneration. We examined the effects of gap-, stand-, and landscape-scale factors on densities of tree seedlings (<1 m tall) and saplings (1-2 m tall) in 59 selection-harvested northern hardwood stands located across a 4500 km(2) region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and assess uncertainty in parameter estimates. Sugar maple (Ater saccharum) saplings were absent from 61% of 154 m(2) plots centered in harvest gaps (n=347) despite its high shade tolerance and overstory dominance, but densities were high in other gaps. Densities of sugar maple seedlings and/or saplings were negatively associated with a combination of greater stand-scale densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), greater gap-scale cover of non-tree vegetation, and lower gap-scale light availability, with deer density having the greatest effect. Densities of unpalatable and commercially less valuable ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), the second most common regeneration species, were positively related to gap-scale seed-production potential but were unrelated to factors affecting sugar maple. Ironwood tended to replace sugar maple saplings in areas with high deer density. At the landscape scale, densities of sugar maple seedlings and saplings decreased with decreasing latitude and snow depth and increasing winter deer densities. These inverse spatial patterns suggest that deer herbivory can lead to landscape-scale variation in regeneration success. However, the spatial distribution of habitat types (a proxy for soil moisture and nutrient conditions) confound this observation, with higher densities of sugar maple generally located on stands with less nutrient-rich habitat types. Results demonstrate that combinations of factors operating at different scales, and with different relative magnitudes of impact, contribute to high variation in regeneration composition and density following timber harvest. Selection silvicultural practices, as currently applied, do not ensure regeneration of desirable species; practices might require modifications in general (e.g., increasing gap size) and to match them to regionally varying factors like deer density.

Based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of cores, we describe and interpret 13 sedimentary subfacies grouped in 9 associations which characterize the following lacustrine subenvironments: elastic littoral (freshwater and saline), springs, microbial mats, bench slope, and pelagial toxic, alternating oxic-anoxic, anoxic and hypersaline, and organic-dominated). Lateral distribution and vertical evolution of subfacies in our model are controlled by climate fluctuations, climate-related limnological parameters (lake level, TDS and brine composition, and redox conditions), and autocyclic processes (progressive infilling of the basin and higher sedimentation rate in the pelagial realm). Microbial and chemical processes govern deposition in this system, and meromixis plays a decisive role in lake dynamics. Phototropic bacterial plate communites at the chemocline dominated as pelagial organic producers during stable meromictic periods, whereas benthic microbial communities developed during mixed water periods. Water stratification during the Holocene was mainly controlled by three parameters: I) basin morphometry, 2) lake level, and 3) differences in TDS values between mixolimnion and monimolimnion waters. Sedimentary facies analyses is a powerful descriptive and interpretative tool that greatly contributes to deciphering the high resolution paleoenvironmental information archived in lake sequences. Depositional and paleoenvironmental models provide a dynamic framework for integrating paleolimnological data and other proxy paleorecords. Medicine lake serves as a facies model for shallow, perennial hypersaline, meromictic lakes in modern and ancient lacustrine basins. The sediment sequence from Medicine lake cores is consistent with the general paleoclimatic evolution of the northern Great Plains since the retreat of ice sheets. Our study reveals a plethora of rapid fluctuations in the water cycle both during the middle and the late Holocene, These augment prior paleoclimate reconstructions based on diatom studies of the lower Holocene freshwater to saline transition and on pollen profiles which show little variability during the subsequent long prairie grass episode.					; Garcés, Blas/L-4246-2014	Valero Garces, Blas/0000-0003-2214-7057; 													0921-2728					SEP	1995	14	2					123	149		10.1007/BF00735478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00735478													WOS:A1995RW10000003
J	HOWARDWILLIAMS, C				HOWARDWILLIAMS, C			DYNAMIC PROCESSES IN NEW-ZEALAND LAND-WATER ECOTONES	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This paper reviews current knowledge of dynamic processes in New Zealand land-water ecotones drawing on published quantitative data wherever possible. Basic ecosystem processes in forested and natural unforested land-water ecotones are compared, and dynamic processes are discussed under the following headings: time scales of change; water movement; sediment trapping and transport; dissolved nutrient dynamics; dissolved oxygen; trophic interactions. Environmental "resetting" agents such as floods, fires and storms have been shown to be important regulators of change at the land-water interface. However, an element of stability is imparted by continuous allochthonous inputs from evergreen vegetation into the water at the interface, as well as an important contribution from terrestrial insects. Stable isotope studies have shown that such inputs are translated as a carbon source through aquatic food chains in some New Zealand streams. Dynamics of sediment movement and nutrients are governed by the complex patterns of water movement along the ecotone. Patterns of water movement at this interface are controlled by obstructions to flow providing eddies and "dead zones". Manning's coefficient of drag is a convenient measure of the degree of obstruction by aquatic vegetation, fallen branches etc. Nutrient dynamics along the land-water interface of lakes and streams are affected not only in moving surface water, but also in groundwater. New Zealand studies have, in recent years, concentrated on nitrogen pathways in ground waters at the interface where denitrification is shown to be an important N sink. This is controlled largely by dissolved oxygen and prevailing redox conditions. Implications for management of New Zealand land-water ecotones where ecosystem dynamics are governed by periodic physical disruptions such as floods, fires or dry-wet cycles are discussed.

J	GUILBAULT, JP				GUILBAULT, JP			QUATERNARY FORAMINIFERAL STRATIGRAPHY IN SEDIMENTS OF THE EASTERN CHAMPLAIN SEA BASIN, QUEBEC	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Sediments of the late-glacial Champlain Sea basin have been sampled at 18 sites in the Trois-Rivieres and Quebec City regions. Two successions of foraminiferal ecozones (deep and shallow water) comparable to those previously reported from the western Champlain Sea are recognized. Faunal composition indicates an early phase (pre-A) of hyposaline waters with consistent freshwater evidence only at the southwestern limit of the area. Salinity control in pre-A could be the result of advance or retreat of an ice lobe in the Quebec City region. It is followed by zone A (salinity: 25-32 parts per thousand) which is in part synchronous with the formation of the St-Narcisse Moraine. In the easternmost Champlain Sea, zone A lasted approximately from 11.3 until after 10.6 ka BP, possibly up to near 10.2 ka BP. In the western part of the area, it is progressively replaced by the less saline conditions of zones B (10-25 parts per thousand) and C (2-10 parts per thousand). Near major freshwater inlets, thick delta sequences barren of foraminifera substitute for zones B and C. East of Trois-Rivieres, zone B is probably discontinuous and does not reach Quebec City. Zone C is present at only one site, west of Trois-Rivieres. The shallow water zones EH and EA, contemporaneous with zones A and B, record relatively high salinities (annual maximum of up to 30 parts per thousand for EH, somewhat less for EA), zone EA suggesting also warmer summers. The paleoecological results concerning salinity do not allow detection of the diversion of Lake Agassiz outflow. The discharge envisaged by some authors may not have been large enough to detectably change salinity in the deep, late Champlain Sea. In shallow waters, the effect could have been significant but would be difficult to date because of error due to recycled old carbonate.																			0705-7199						1993	47	1					43	68		10.7202/032930ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032930ar													WOS:A1993LF38400003

This study reconstructs late Quaternary environmental changes on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau based on sand deposits. The study area is located close to the present maximum extent of the East-Asian summer monsoon and is likely to register shifts in monsoon extent. Furthermore, different sediment deposits are available that allow reconstruction of sediment pathways between the different archives. Sediment deposition in the catchment is dominated by deposition of sand. Sandy deposits in the form of dune fields and sand sheets are widespread on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and are an important archive for paleoclimatic reconstruction. This study shows that sand deposits on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are local phenomena that still bear the sedimentological and geochemical fingerprint of their source materials. Reconstruction of transport processes in the local sediment cascade shows that local sand deposits are the main source of Tibetan mountain loess. Six long sections were sampled and analysed for their geochemical and sedimentological characteristics, showing that both sand and loess deposits have a local source. A special focus was placed on the manganese concentration and the related environmental implications. In several sections, an increase in Mn concentration from 318 +/- 44 to 878 +/- 294 ppm was found, independent of concentrations in Fe and organic compounds. Since the increase in Mn is caused by solid Mn3+ and Mn4+ alone, it is interpreted as increased dust input. The synchronicity with climatic variations on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau confirms the climatic interpretation of the variations in Mn. Sand and dust transport both took place around 11 ka, followed by a period of fixation or even erosion of sediments. Although increased sand transport in the catchment already started around 3 ka, the increased dust input did not take place before 0.7 ka. Therefore. the Mn concentrations are interpreted as an indication of increased dust transport during the very late Holocene, related to colder and drier circumstances during that time. The use of manganese as a proxy for dust is a valuable addition to the toolbox of paleoclimate reconstruction, since it is a direct proxy of dust in deposits. However, further validation and testing should be performed before general acceptation of Mn as a paleoclimate proxy in terrestrial sediments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Haberle, SG; Szeicz, JM; Bennett, KD				Haberle, SG; Szeicz, JM; Bennett, KD			Late Holocene vegetation dynamics and lake geochemistry at Laguna Miranda, XI Region, Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Palynological and geochemical analysis of late Holocene lake sediments and dendrochronological analysis of Pilgerodendron in a volcanically active region of southern Chile reveal the long-term impact of a series of tephra fall events and tectonic activity on lake sedimentation and local vegetation. An upper 0.75 m core overlaps with a 4.35 m long Livingstone piston core to give a 4.60 m long sediment record, extending back to 4800 yr BP. Geochemical data shows the shift from allogenic dominance to authigenic and biogenic dominance as waterlogged soils developed within the catchment. This is presumed to have occurred under the influence of continued addition of nutrients to the catchment from tephra deposition and the associated high sedimentation rates. The palynological record from this site is dominated by Nothofagus dombeyi-type and Filicales. The most prominent changes in the pollen record, however, are the gradual decline in Podocarpus nubigena pollen throughout the last 4800 yr; the appearance and increase of Gramineae pollen during the past 2100 yr: and the rapid increase in the pollen of Pilgerodendron uviferum within the past 300-300 yr. Pilgerodendron tree-ring analysis and the pollen results over the last 400 years show that the most recent expansion of Pilgerodendron at the northern and eastern margins of this site is a response to either, periodic tectonic induced watertable changes, or is part of a long-term trend in gymnosperm growth around a shallowing lake margin. The decline of shade-intolerant toes such as I Weinmannia and Podocarpus within a Nothofagus-rich forest community towards an increased presence of Pilgerodendron and Gramineae (likely Chusquea bamboo), that began over 2100 yr BP, may have been due as much to autogenic processes such as a change in the disturbance regime resulting in the development of waterlogged soils, rather than to an episode of climate change. It is important to recognise the potential effects of autogenic processes that may result from disturbance such as volcanic/tectonic activity in reconstructing past vegetation dynamics from pollen records.

J	KUMAR, S; SRIVASTAVA, P				KUMAR, S; SRIVASTAVA, P			MICROFOSSILS FROM THE KHEINJUA FORMATION, MESOPROTEROZOIC SEMRI GROUP, NEWARI AREA, CENTRAL INDIA	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												A well preserved and diversified microfossil assemblage is reported from a new locality, Newari, Son Valley area, Uttar Pradesh from the black bedded chert belonging to the Fawn Limestone Member of the Kheinjua Formation ( similar to 1200 Ma), Semri Group (Lower Vindhyans). In all, 28 species belonging to 18 genera representing both coccoid and filamentous forms are described. These are associated with microbial laminites. Excluding Archaeoellipsoides and Bactrophycus, and forms of acritarchean affinity, the diameter range among coccoids is between 2 and 24 mu m, averaging 10.4 mu m, and the width of the filamentous forms is from 1.5 to 28 mu m, averaging 6.8 mu m. Eoentophysalis and Siphonophycus are the two most dominating forms. In comparison to filamentous forms the coccoid forms show more morphological diversity. Well preserved cellular filaments are few in number. In both coccoid and filamentous forms there is a possibility that many forms represent degradational variants of a common biological entity. When the Newari assemblage is compared with other Proterozoic microbial assemblages, it shows maximum resemblance with the assemblage described from the Meso- to Neoproterozoic Deoban Limestone, Garhwal Lesser Himalaya, India, with 12 genera being present in both assemblages. It has 9 genera in common with the Tindir Creek Group, 8 genera with the Balbirini Dolomite, 8 genera with the Draken Conglomerates assemblage, 8 genera with the Bitter Springs Formation and 6 genera with the Belcher Islands assemblage. The following assemblage is reported: (1) the coccoid forms Eoentophysalis belcherensis, E. magna, Myxococcoides minor, M. grandis, Sphaerophycus parvum, S. medium, Huroniospora sp., Eosynechococcus moorei and E, isolatus, cf.

We made twice weekly measurements of bacterial abundance and production (thymidine incorporation), chi a, primacy production, nanoflagellate and ciliate abundances, alkaline phosphates activity (APA), phosphate turnover time, and the phosphorus deficiency index (PDI; rate of light saturated photosynthesis divided by the maximum phosphate uptake veracity). The lake was characterized by three periods with different phytoplankton strategies for acquiring P. In early June when flagellates were >90% of phytoplankton biomass and approximate to 67% of the flagellates were potential bacteriovores, flagellate grazing roughly match bacterial mortality, and we calculated that approximate to 50% of the flagellate P needs were potentially met by ingesting bacteria. During July, when bacterial production was greatest, bacterial abundance remained constant at approximate to 1x10(9)/l. At this time potential flagellate bacteriovory constituted >25% of bacterial mortality. Densities of the small cladocerans, Diphanosoma brachyrum and Daphnia cucullata, reached >100/l in late July and were likely the dominant bacterivores. The PDI increased from indicating severe P deficiency in June to moderate P deficiency in July. By August, the phytoplankton community was approximate to 50% composed of the two N(2-)fixing cynobacteria, Anabaena sp. and Gloeotrichia echinulata. These cyanobacteria have internal P stores, and the PDI showed low P deficiency with the dominance of cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacterial production decreased by an order of magnitude, but the exact cause for the decline was not evident. During late July, approximate to 20% of the bacteria were in "aggregate" that were a refuge from grazing. The large bacteria in the aggregates were probably a "sink" for nutrients conomita with the rapid turnover of the free planktonic bacteria. Thus bacteria as do algae have growth forms that escape grazing.																			0071-1128		3-510-47053-2				1998	51						1	20																WOS:000078414300001
J	Brauer, J; Geber, MA				Brauer, J; Geber, MA			Population differentiation in the range expansion of a native maritime plant, Solidago sempervirens L.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Solidago sempervirens, a halophytic goldenrod native to coastal dunes and marshes of eastern North America, has expanded its range inland along roads in parts of the northeastern United States during the past 20-30 yr. This expansion has been concurrent with the application of deicing salts on roadways in winter. During the same period, the species has appeared inland along the St. Lawrence waterway and the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States and near salt mines or seeps in western and west-central New York. In a greenhouse study of nine populations from coastal Massachusetts to west-central New York, we asked whether S. sempervirens has a physiological dependence on salt and whether populations differ genetically with respect to ecologically important traits, such as salt tolerance, phenology, and biomass allocation. Progeny from 20 maternal families per population were subjected to three watering treatments: control (no salt), medium salt (2% salinity), and high salt (4% salinity). Phenotypic traits differed significantly by treatment, population, and population response to treatment. Total plant mass decreased in response to salt, indicating no physiological dependence on salt; the species association with saline environments may therefore result from a tolerance for salt and to low competitive ability in nonsaline habitats. The reduction in total plant mass with increasing salt primarily resulted from a decrease in average shoot mass and less to a reduction in root mass. Even so, root allocation (i.e., the allometric exponent relating root mass to shoot mass) decreased from the control to the mid- and high-salt treatments. The propensity to flower during the course of the experiment also decreased with increasing salt. Flowering propensity increased from eastern to western populations in parallel with a gradient of increasing continentality. There was also some indication that coastal populations were less tolerant of high salt than inland populations. These geographic patterns of trait differentiation may indicate adaptive divergence among populations. There was significant variation attributable to family for biomass traits, but few trait heritabilities differed significantly from zero within populations.																			1058-5893	1537-5315				JAN	2002	163	1					141	150		10.1086/324047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/324047													WOS:000172542400013
J	MOSS, B				MOSS, B			BRACKISH AND FRESH-WATER SHALLOW LAKES - DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OR VARIATIONS ON THE SAME THEME	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Saline lakes may be divided into two categories - those primarily saline because they are endorheic and those secondarily saline (brackish) because of natural or anthropomorphic inputs of sea water. Endorheic lakes have greatly varying composition and salinity, occur in arid regions and are not as abundant for that reason as exorheic lakes. The area of land surface over which they are the characteristic types, is, however, very considerable. Many endorheic lakes have communities of low diversity but the reason for this is not necessarily high salinity - the world's largest endorheic lake, the ocean, has a very high diversity-but the temporariness of many of these habitats which has led to wide and unpredictable fluctuations in salinity and to periodic drying out. Secondarily saline lakes are rather different. They generally have an ionic composition which is that of diluted sea water, and although they do not have the high diversity of marine communities, they often have comparable, if slightly lesser, diversities with those of freshwaters. There are no firm salinity boundaries between fresh and brackish waters, only ones drawn (e.g. at 5 per mille total salts) by convention. Brackish waters have the particular interest that estuarine organisms including mysid shrimps and essentially marine members of the algal division, the Haptophyta, may colonize and establish themselves in food webs otherwise characteristic of freshwaters. A comparison is made between the systems of brackish and freshwater lakes in the Norfolk Broadland of eastern England, most of which have undergone eutrophication. Although at first sight appearing very different, both fall into a similar pattern when processes of change are considered. Increases in salinity serve as indirect switch mechanisms which, like other but different mechanisms in freshwaters, may cause the lake community to change from submerged plant dominance to phytoplankton dominance at intermediate states of nutrient loading. The current drought in eastern England is inducing small salinity changes that support this assertion.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						1	14		10.1007/BF00026695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026695													WOS:A1994NB19800002

Emphasis was placed on a black alder forest representing the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the alder forest, more than 96% of the alder roots were colonised by ectomycorrhizal fungi. The diversity and vitality of these mycorrhizal rootlets exhibited local differences being generally lower at a dystric-dry site compared to an eutric-wet site close to the lake. Bacterial populations typical of well-aerated arable soils and rhizosphere soils were detected in samples taken from the soil at the eutric-wet site although unfavourable anoxic conditions were assumed to occur near to the lake. The composition of the bacterial populations seems to be profoundly influenced by the plant. Furthermore, the Alnus-Frankia-symbiosis showed a high spatial variability and was also more extensively established at the lake shore indicating both higher nitrogen requirement of the trees and higher energy supply for N-2-fixing actinomycetes by the tree. The high energy supply by the trees at the eutric-wet site could be confirmed by the soil carbon availability index. The role of plants on in situ soil respiration was estimated for agricultural and forest sites. The aggregated and modelled data for arable soil indicated that the respiration of roots and rhizosphere organisms contributed up to 40% of the total soil respiration during summer. An even higher contribution to soil respiration may have been derived from rhizomicrobial respiration in the alder forest. In conclusion, the amount of carbon delivered below ground seemed to be adjusted dependent on ecosystem type and environmental conditions. In particular, alder trees seemed to have established a beneficial environment for the microbiota in the rhizosphere. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Harrington, TB; Peter, DH; Devine, WD				Harrington, Timothy B.; Peter, David H.; Devine, Warren D.			Two-Year Effects of Aminopyralid on an Invaded Meadow in the Washington Cascades	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Four rates of aminopyralid (30, 60, 90, and 120 g ae ha(-1) [0.4, 0.9, 1.3, and 1.8 oz ae acre(-1)]) were compared for their ability to reduce abundance of nonnative dicot species and favor native species in an invaded Cascade Mountain meadow near Trout Lake, WA. Treatments were applied in two replicated studies (June 2009 and 2010), and foliar cover and species richness were monitored for two years. First-year control of nonnative dicots from application of 30 g ae ha(-1) of aminopyralid (69%) was greater than that of native dicots (29%); whereas, significant control of both species groups occurred at the higher rates. By the second year after treatment, absolute differences in cover between treated and non-treated plots averaged 17% and 21% for native and nonnative dicots, respectively, and +1% and +27% for native and nonnative monocots, respectively. First-year control of Canada thistle and oxeye daisy was greater after treatment in 2009 (88% and 90%, respectively) than after treatment in 2010 (56% and 55%, respectively), probably because lower spring temperatures in 2010 limited vegetation development and plant susceptibility to aminopyralid. Cover of Kentucky bluegrass and sheep fescue averaged 20% and 6% greater, respectively, in treated plots than in non-treated plots. Application of 30 g ae ha(-1) of aminopyralid had no detectable effect on second-year richness of native and nonnative species relative to non-treated plots; however, higher rates caused 24% to 43% reductions in richness of each species group. Research results suggest that application of aminopyralid at 30 g ae ha(-1) has the potential to reduce abundance of nonnative dicot species in similar meadow communities of the Pacific Northwest with little or no negative impacts to abundance and richness of native species. As a potential strategy to limit the subsequent spread of Kentucky bluegrass, a grass herbicide, such as fluazifop or sethoxydim, could be added to the treatment.																			1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2014	7	1					14	24		10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00005.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00005.1													WOS:000333491800002

Major element analyses (energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)) were carried out on juvenile fragments extracted from 12 tephra layers (OH-DP-0115 to OH-DP-2060). The geochemical analyses of the glass shards of all of these layers suggest an origin in the Italian volcanic provinces. They include the Y-3 (OH-DP-0115, 26.68-29.42 ka cal BP), the Campanian Ignimbrite-Y-5 (OH-DP-0169, 39.6 +/- 0.1 ka), and the X-6 (OH-DP-0404, 109 +/- 2 ka) from the Campanian volcanoes, the P-11 of Pantelleria (OH-DP-0499, 133.5 +/- 2 ka), the Vico B (OH-DP-0617, 162 +/- 6 ka) from the Vico volcano, the Pozzolane Rosse (OH-DP-1817, 457 +/- 2 ka) and the Tufo di Bagni Albule (OH-DP-2060, 527 +/- 2 ka) from the Colli Albani volcanic district, and the Fall A (OH-DP-2010, 496 +/- 3 ka) from the Sabatini volcanic field. Furthermore, a comparison of the Ohrid record with tephrostratigraphic records of mid-distal archives related to the Mediterranean area allowed the recognition of the equivalents of other less known tephra layers, such as the TM24a-POP2 (OH-DP-0404, 102 +/- 2 ka) recognized in the Lago Grande di Monticchio and the Sulmona Basin, the CF-V5-PRAD3225 (OH-DP-0624, ca. 163 +/- 22 ka) identified in the Campo Felice Basin and the Adriatic Sea, the SC5 (OH-DP-1955, 493.1 +/- 10.9 ka) recognized in the Mercure Basin, and the A11/12 (OH-DP-2017, 511 +/- 6 ka) sampled at the Acerno Basin, whose specific volcanic sources are still poorly constrained. Additionally, one cryptotephra (OH-DP-0027) was identified by correlation of the potassium X-ray flourescence (XRF) intensities from the DEEP site with those from a short core of a previous study from Lake Ohrid. In these cores, a maximum in potassium is caused by glass shards, which were correlated with the Mercato tephra (8.43-8.63 ka cal BP) from Somma-Vesuvius. The tephrostratigraphic work presented here allows, for the first time, the extension of a consistent part of the Middle Pleistocene tephrostratigraphy of Italian volcanoes as far as the Balkans. The establishment of the tephrostratigraphic framework for the Lake Ohrid record provides important, independent tie points for the age-depth model of the DEEP site sequence, which is a prerequisite for palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Furthermore, this age-depth model will help to improve and re-evaluate the chronology of other, both undated and dated tephra layers from other records. Thus, the Lake Ohrid record may potentially become the template for the central Mediterranean tephrostratigraphy, especially for the hitherto poorly known and explored lower Middle Pleistocene period.					; Giaccio, Biagio/B-2561-2017; Del Carlo, Paola/AAH-1725-2019; Francke, Alexander/N-9761-2013; Di Vito, Mauro/MEQ-2109-2025; Sulpizio, Roberto/S-2133-2019; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012	Nomade, Sebastien/0000-0001-7373-0571; Giaccio, Biagio/0000-0002-7007-9127; Del Carlo, Paola/0000-0001-5506-4579; Leicher, Niklas/0000-0002-3367-5982; Zanchetta, Giovanni/0000-0002-7080-9599; Sulpizio, Roberto/0000-0002-3930-5421; Francke, Alexander/0000-0002-0370-5802; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	7					2151	2178		10.5194/bg-13-2151-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2151-2016													WOS:000377276000012

The samples were analyzed for various organic species such as LMW monocarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, oxocarboxylic acids, biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA)-tracers (isoprene- and alpha-pinene-oxidation products), and tracers of primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs, e.g., saccharides), together with inorganic ions. Formic, acetic, and oxalic acids were detected as dominant carboxylic acids. Their concentrations in the fog samples were significantly lower than those from urban area in North America, Asia, and Europe and from forest area in Taiwan, except for oxalic acid in May. Concentrations of oxalic acid in May were higher than those in July, being consistent with higher values of SO4 and NO3. Based on the air mass back trajectories, the Asian continent is suggested to contribute higher levels of dicarboxylic acids in fog water in spring. Concentrations of formic and acetic acids together with biogenic tracers in the present study were higher in July than in May. In July samples, concentrations of formic plus acetic acids showed positive correlations with biogenic SOA tracers and PBAPs. Oxalic acid also correlated with biogenic SOA tracers and PBAPs. Primary emission from biogenic sources and secondary formation are important factors to control the levels of LMW mono- and di-carboxylic acids in fog from Lake Mashu in July. pH of fog water ranged from 3.8 to 5.9. Total cation equivalents (Na+, NH4+, K+ Ca2+, Mg+, and H+) were comparable to total anion equivalents (SO42-, NO3-, Cl-, and detected organic anions). Contributions of organic acid equivalents to organic plus inorganic acid equivalents were low (range: 4-17%). Major ions in fog water of Lake Mashu were inorganic during the sampling periods. This study demonstrates that levels of organic and inorganic acids are not high enough to cause a damage on the tree ecosystem in the surroundings of Lake Mashu.

Without changes in nutrient loading, large-scale declines in submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes are largely attributed to strong external or internal forces, including changes in water level. As a winter-active submerged macrophyte, Potamogeton crispus has important functions in aquatic ecosystem. The objectives of our study were to reveal the effects of water depths on the germination, growth, reproduction and morphological changes of P. crispus under natural environmental conditions; identify the optimum water depth range for colonization of P. crispus; and predict the succession course for P. crispus in Lake Taihu. Methods A long-term in situ experiment was performed to study the effects of water depth on the growth and morphology of P. crispus across the entire life cycle. Plants were grown in the improved cross type of rhizotrons for 30 weeks at three different water depths (60, 120 and 200 cm) in Dongtaihu Bay of Lake Taihu. We measured the plant height, root length, the length and width of leaves and counted the numbers of leaves, ramets, turion spikes and roots of each plant on each observation day during the experiment. Important Findings Water depths ranging from 60 to 120 cm were favourable for above-ground vegetation growth, root tissue growth and the reproductive ability of P. crispus. At water depth of 200 cm or beyond, the distribution of P. crispus will be limited in the following year because of the lack of turion formation and the severe inhibition of ramet production. The relationship between above-ground biomass and growth time at three different water depths fits a logistic growth curve well (P < 0.001). The rapid growth and distribution with high density of P. crispus at water depth near 60 cm during the reproductive stage is not favourable for growth of other submerged species. So a continuous water depth of similar to 60-120 cm is the optimum growth depth range for the conservation and restoration of P. crispus in Lake Taihu. In addition, the morphological parameters values acquired can replace or provide the ranges for the value of GmaxSB (the maximum growth rate of submerged plants, in the unit of d(-1)) obtained via calibration in the control equations of submerged plant growth in the Eco-Taihu model, which is a three-dimensional ecological model of Lake Taihu.

The last deglaciation of Alaska and a new benchmark 10Be moraine chronology from the western Alaska Range	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We report 50 new and 22 previously published Be-10 ages from 15 distinct moraine crests in the western Alaska Range spanning from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) terminal moraine to a latest Pleistocene moraine immediately down valley from late Holocene moraines. Moraines were deposited between 21.3 +/- 0.8 ka and 12.8 +/- 0.6 ka and conform morphostratigraphically, giving us high confidence in the chronology. Our record, and the key records reviewed in our compilation from across Alaska indicate a culmination of the regional LGM between ca. 21-19 ka. Our chronology, unmatched in resolution from a single valley in Alaska, indicates that steady glacier recession from ca. 21-18 ka was punctuated by accelerated retreat from ca. 17-16 ka, followed by a period of prolonged moraine deposition between ca. 16 and 15 ka. After ca. 15 ka rapid glacier retreat was punctuated by a re-advance ca. 12.8 ka. Other chronologies across Alaska show further evidence of moraine deposition between ca. 16-15 ka and ca. 13-12 ka. The emerging pattern of glacier retreat through the last deglaciation in Alaska is compared to several global, regional, and local climate proxies to assess what climate factors controlled the timing and pace of glacier retreat in Alaska. We hypothesize that warming caused by rising boreal summer insolation drove initial and steady deglaciation from the LGM terminal moraine position until ca. 18 ka, after which time global warming from rising CO2 concentrations accelerated retreat. Subsequent periods of moraine deposition in Alaska coincide with decreasing trends in the NGRIP ice core record, at the culmination of Heinrich Stadial 1 (ca. 16-15 ka), and during the early Younger Dryas between 13 and 12.5 ka. While comparisons are made between alpine glacier records and the timing of other geologic events that may have impacted local-to-regional climate (e.g., the opening of the Bering Strait, the saddle collapse between the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice sheets, and post-LGM Bering Sea dynamics), the relationship between our record and these geologic events are ambiguous. We suggest glaciers across Alaska were possibly more sensitive to other regional and global climate forcing mechanisms, mainly rising insolation, global CO2 rise, and Northern Hemisphere Ocean circulation forcing through deglaciation.

J	Barak, AV; McGrevy, D; Tokaya, G				Barak, AV; McGrevy, D; Tokaya, G			Dispersal and re-capture of marked, overwintering Tomicus piniperda (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) from Scotch pine bolts	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												The pine shoot beetle (PSB), Tomicus piniperda is a recently established exotic pest of live pine in the southern Great Lakes region of the U.S. and Canada. Scotch pine, Pinus sylvestris L. is the most susceptible pine species, but the adult also attacks several other North American species of Pinus. This research investigated the dispersal behavior of beetles emerging from overwintering sites to aid in the development of effective monitoring and management practices. Scotch pine logs with overwintering PSB were sprayed with fluorescent pigments to mark dispersing beetles. These logs were placed in piles in the centers of three circular trap arrays of 8-unit Lindgren traps, baited with a-pinene, and placed at distances of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 meters from the center along equally spaced radii. An estimated average of 393 PSB, or 23.4% of the overwintering PSB, dispersed from each of three log piles during the initial spring dispersal flight, and 21.9% of these were captured in traps. Traps within 100 meters caught 56.0 to 67.8% of the marked PSB recovered. Most (95.3%) marked PSB were trapped within 400 meters, but 12 beetles (4.7%) were trapped 780-2,000 meters away in adjacent trap arrays. The dispersal pattern of the population, as indicated by trap catch, was to the northeast, in the direction of prevailing westerly/ southerly winds up to 4.77 m/s daily average during beetle flight. Regression analysis suggests that the PSB within the experimental area had a predicted dispersal distance of 900 meters in an area that contained numerous traps. Dispersal distances may be greater under of conditions of strong and steady winds or if traps or abundant host material removed fewer PSB from the dispersing population. The use of traps to monitor specific sites should consider the direction of prevailing winds. Trap catches of wild PSB suggest that optimal inter-trap spacing for efficient detection could be about 78 m.																			0090-0222					SUM	2000	33	2					69	80																WOS:000172223200001

Paleo-Ecology of the Yedoma Ice Complex on Sobo-Sise Island (EasternLena Delta, Siberian Arctic)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Late Pleistocene permafrost of the Yedoma type constitutes a valuable paleo-environmental archive due to the presence of numerous and well-preserved floral and faunal fossils. The study of the fossil Yedoma inventory allows for qualitative and quantitative reconstructions of past ecosystem and climate conditions and variations over time. Here, we present the results of combined paleo-proxy studies including pollen, chironomid, diatom and mammal fossil analyses from a prominent Yedoma cliff on Sobo-Sise Island in the eastern Lena Delta, NE Siberia to complement previous and ongoing paleo-ecological research in western Beringia. The Yedoma Ice Complex (IC) cliff on Sobo-Sise Island (up to 28 m high, 1.7 km long) was continuously sampled at 0.5 m resolution. The entire sequence covers the last about 52 cal kyr BP, but is not continuous as it shows substantial hiatuses at 36-29 cal kyr BP, at 20-17 cal kyr BP and at 15-7 cal kyr BP. The Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 Yedoma IC (52-28 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra show typical features of tundra-steppe vegetation. Green algae remains indicate freshwater conditions. The chironomid assemblages vary considerably in abundance and diversity. Chironomid-based T-July reconstructions during MIS 3 reveal warmer-than-today T-July at about 51 cal kyr BP, 46-44 and 41 cal kyr BP. The MIS 2 Yedoma IC (28-15 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra represent tundra-steppe vegetation as during MIS 3, but higher abundance of Artemisia and lower abundances of algae remains indicate drier summer conditions. The chironomid records are poor. The MIS 1 (7-0 cal kyr BP) pollen spectra indicate shrub-tundra vegetation. The chironomid fauna is sparse and not diverse. The chironomid-based T-July reconstruction supports similar-as-today temperatures at 6.4-4.4 cal kyr BP. Diatoms were recorded only after about 6.4 cal kyr BP. The Sobo-Sise Yedoma record preserves traces of the West Beringian tundra-steppe that maintained the Mammoth fauna including rare evidence for woolly rhinoceros' presence. Chironomid-based T-July reconstructions complement previous plant-macrofossil based T-July of regional MIS 3 records. Our study from the eastern Lena Delta fits into and extends previous paleo-ecological Yedoma studies to characterize Beringian paleo-environments in the Laptev Sea coastal region.

Geology of the High Rock caldera complex, northwest Nevada, and implications for intense rhyolitic volcanism associated with flood basalt magmatism and the initiation of the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone trend	GEOSPHERE												We present the geologic history of the High Rock caldera complex (HRCC; Nevada, USA), a major mid-Miocene silicic center associated with flood basalt volcanism. Based on 70 40Ar/39Ar ages and new 1:24,000- and 1:100,000-scale geologic mapping, we document that between ca. 16.5 and 15.5 Ma a minimum of similar to 700 km(3) of rhyolitic magma erupted from the HRCC, covering an area of similar to 8300 km(2) in northwestern Nevada and southern Oregon (USA). The volcanism immediately followed eruption of the Steens flood basalt in the region, and was contemporaneous with eruption of compositionally similar rhyolites from the McDermitt volcanic field (MVF) to the east. The HRCC and MVF together mark the starting point for the east-ward-younging trend of voluminous rhyolitic calderas of the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone trend. The HRCC comprises 4 major calderas, 2440 km in diameter, that young from north-northeast to south-southwest: the Virgin Valley caldera formed on eruption of the 16.38 Ma high-silica alkali rhyolite Idaho Canyon Tuff; the overlapping Badger Mountain caldera collapsed due to eruption of the 16.34 Ma crystal-rich, low-silica rhyolite Summit Lake Tuff; eruption of the moderately per-alkaline high-silica alkali rhyolite Soldier Meadow Tuff at 16 Ma resulted in formation of the Hanging Rock caldera; and the Cottonwood Creek caldera formed on eruption of the newly recognized, 15.70 Ma tuff of Yellow Rock Canyon, which is zoned from high-silica alkali rhyolite to trachyte. The four calderas contain caldera fill deposits, including pumice and ash falls, lahars, phreato-magmatic deposits, and well-bedded lacustrine deposits, which preserve diverse mid-Miocene fossil fauna and flora. Au and U mineralization developed along ring fractures of the Virgin Valley and Cottonwood Creek calderas. After silicic volcanism largely ceased, trachyte, trachyandesite, and alkalic basaltic lavas erupted through the caldera lakes. Intense silicic volcanism at the HRCC during the interval 16.4-15.5 Ma overlapped the eruption of the Steens and Columbia River Basalts, strongly suggesting a petrogenetic link. We propose that the HRCC and MVF caldera centers are localized where dikes of Steens flood basalt encountered transitional crust west of the craton with a composition and thickness that allowed significant partial melting, based on the O and Nd isotopic values of the rhyolites, which require involvement of crustal melts in their origin. Steens Basalt eruptions largely ceased in the area by the time the oldest caldera-forming ignimbrites erupted at both the HRCC and MVF, indicating that once large silicic magma bodies aggregated in the crust, they intercepted flood basalt dikes. We suggest that the roots of the HRCC and MVF are composed of large volumes of gabbroic intrusions and cumulates formed by fractional crystallization of HRCC magmas, which strengthened the middle crust beneath the calderas; major basin-bounding normal faults are diverted around them, but outflow ignimbrites are prominently offset by Basin and Range faults.

The volcanism immediately followed eruption of the Steens flood basalt in the region, and was contemporaneous with eruption of compositionally similar rhyolites from the McDermitt volcanic field (MVF) to the east. The HRCC and MVF together mark the starting point for the east-ward-younging trend of voluminous rhyolitic calderas of the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone trend. The HRCC comprises 4 major calderas, 2440 km in diameter, that young from north-northeast to south-southwest: the Virgin Valley caldera formed on eruption of the 16.38 Ma high-silica alkali rhyolite Idaho Canyon Tuff; the overlapping Badger Mountain caldera collapsed due to eruption of the 16.34 Ma crystal-rich, low-silica rhyolite Summit Lake Tuff; eruption of the moderately per-alkaline high-silica alkali rhyolite Soldier Meadow Tuff at 16 Ma resulted in formation of the Hanging Rock caldera; and the Cottonwood Creek caldera formed on eruption of the newly recognized, 15.70 Ma tuff of Yellow Rock Canyon, which is zoned from high-silica alkali rhyolite to trachyte. The four calderas contain caldera fill deposits, including pumice and ash falls, lahars, phreato-magmatic deposits, and well-bedded lacustrine deposits, which preserve diverse mid-Miocene fossil fauna and flora. Au and U mineralization developed along ring fractures of the Virgin Valley and Cottonwood Creek calderas. After silicic volcanism largely ceased, trachyte, trachyandesite, and alkalic basaltic lavas erupted through the caldera lakes. Intense silicic volcanism at the HRCC during the interval 16.4-15.5 Ma overlapped the eruption of the Steens and Columbia River Basalts, strongly suggesting a petrogenetic link. We propose that the HRCC and MVF caldera centers are localized where dikes of Steens flood basalt encountered transitional crust west of the craton with a composition and thickness that allowed significant partial melting, based on the O and Nd isotopic values of the rhyolites, which require involvement of crustal melts in their origin. Steens Basalt eruptions largely ceased in the area by the time the oldest caldera-forming ignimbrites erupted at both the HRCC and MVF, indicating that once large silicic magma bodies aggregated in the crust, they intercepted flood basalt dikes. We suggest that the roots of the HRCC and MVF are composed of large volumes of gabbroic intrusions and cumulates formed by fractional crystallization of HRCC magmas, which strengthened the middle crust beneath the calderas; major basin-bounding normal faults are diverted around them, but outflow ignimbrites are prominently offset by Basin and Range faults.

J	Peterson, DP; Fausch, KD; White, GC				Peterson, DP; Fausch, KD; White, GC			Population ecology of an invasion: Effects of brook trout on native cutthroat trout	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the-inland western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival, emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c. pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 in segments of four small mountain streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation, age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed. At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates, whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation. Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison, brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate the threat to native cutthroat,trout, but selective removal regimes that capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be required.

Coincident extremely large sporadic sodium and sporadic E layers observed in the lower thermosphere over Colorado and Utah	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												On the night of 2 June 2002, the sodium lidar in Fort Collins, CO (40.6 N, 105 W) measured an extremely strong sporadic sodium layer lasting from 03:30 to 05:00 UT with several weaker layers later in the night at 06:00 and 09:00 UT. There is a double layer structure with peaks at 101 and 104 km. The peak sodium density was 21000 atoms/cm(3) with a column abundance of up to twice that of the normal sodium layer. The peak density was 500 times greater than the typical density at that altitude. The sporadic layer abundance and strength factor were higher than any reported in the literature. The two lidar beams, separated by 70 km at this altitude, both measured 0.6 h periodicities in the abundance, but out of phase with each other by 0.3 h. There is also evidence for strong wave activity in the lidar temperatures and winds. The NOAA ionosonde in Boulder, CO (40.0 N, 105 W) measured a critical frequency (f(o)E(s)) of 14.3 MHz at 03:00 UT on this night, the highest value anytime during 2002. The high values of total ion density inferred means that Na+ fraction must have been only a few percent to explain the neutral Na layer abundances. The Bear Lake, Utah (41.9 N, 111.4 W) dynasonde also measured intense E-s between 02:00 and 05:00 UT and again from 06:00 to 08:00 UT about 700 km west of the lidar, with most of the ionograms during these intervals measuring Es up to 12 MHz, the limit of the ionosonde sweep. Other ionosondes around North America on the NGDC database measured normal fees values that night, so it was a localized event within North America. The peak of E-s activity observed in Europe during the summer of 2002 occurred on 4 June. The observations are consistent with the current theories where a combination of wind shears and long period waves form and push downward a concentrated layer of ions, which then chemically react and form a narrow layer of sodium atoms.																			0992-7689	1432-0576					2007	25	1					3	8		10.5194/angeo-25-3-2007	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/angeo-25-3-2007													WOS:000244786500002

We analysed a 7 m long sequence of lake deposits in the Vihorlat Mts in eastern Slovakia (820 m a.s.l.). Chironomid head capsules were used to reconstruct mean July temperature (T-July), other proxies (diatoms, green algae, pollen, geochemistry) were used to reconstruct local environmental changes that might have affected the climate reconstruction, such as epilimnetic total phosphorus concentrations (TP), lake level changes and development of surrounding vegetation. During the Younger Dryas (YD), temperature fluctuated between 7 and 11 degrees C, with distinct, decadal to centennial scale variations, that agree with other palaeoclimate records in Europe such as delta O-18 content in stalagmites or Greenland ice cores. The results indicate that the site was somewhat colder than expected from the general south-to-north YD temperature gradient within Europe, possibly because of north-facing exposition. The warmer phases of the YD were characterised by low water level or even complete desiccation of the lake (12,200-12,400 cal yr BP). At the Late-Glacial/Holocene transition T-July steeply increased from from 11 to 15.5 degrees C (11,700-11,400 cal yr BP) - the highest T-July for entire sequence. This rapid climate change was reflected by all proxies as a compositional change and increasing species diversity. The open woodlands of Pinus, Betula, Larix and Picea were replaced by broad-leaved temperate forests dominated by Betula, later by Litmus and finally by Corylus (ca 9700 cal yr BP). At the same time, input of eroded coarse-grained material into the lake decreased and organic matter (LOI) and biogenic silica increased. The Early-Holocene climate was rather stable till 8700 cal yr BP, with temporary decrease in T-July around 11,200 cal yr BP. The lake was productive with a well-developed littoral, as indicated by both diatoms and chironomids. A distinct decline of T-July to 10 degrees C between 8700 and 8000 cal yr BP was associated with decreasing chironomid diversity and increasing climate moistening indicated by pollen. Tychoplanktonic and phosphorus-demanding diatoms increased which might be explained by hydrological and land-cover changes. Later, a gradual warming started after 7000 cal yr BP and representation of macrophytes, periphytic diatoms and littoral chironomids increased. Our results suggest that the Holocene thermal maximum was taking place unusually early in the Holocene at our study site, but its timing might be affected by topography and mesoclimate. We further demonstrated that temperature changes had coincided with variations in local hydrology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vermonden, K; van der Velde, G; Leuven, RSEW				Vermonden, Kim; van der Velde, Gerard; Leuven, Rob S. E. W.			Key factors for biodiversity of surface waters in climate proof cities	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Climate change is predicted to cause more extreme rain fall in Europe. In case of insufficient retention capacity of sewers, urban storm water needs to be disconnected from the sewer systems to avoid sewage overflows. Moreover, the storage and discharge capacity of surface water systems in urban areas must be increased to manage larger volumes of storm water and to prevent flooding. Proofing cities for climate change by reconstruction of water systems not only helps to avoid 'wet feet', but also offers promising possibilities to create aquatic habitats, to improve water quality and to optimize biodiversity values of urban areas. For that purpose knowledge is needed on key factors determining the ecological status of urban drainage systems. Multivariate analysis of macroinvertebrates in urban water systems (mainly drainage ditches and ponds) in polder areas of the Rhine-Meuse river district in the Netherlands revealed that nutrients, sediment composition, transparency and habitat structure are key factors for macroinvertebrate diversity. Habitat structure was provided by aquatic macrophytes with highly structured growth forms (such as peplids. elodeids and magnonymphaeids). Occurrence and abundance of these plants were subsequently related to nutrient load. Nitrate levels in surface water were negatively related to several diversity indices of macroinvertebrate assemblages and submerged vegetation cover was positively related to diversity indices. Knowing the key factors for biodiversity in urban water systems, we investigated the sources of nutrient load. The primary source was the local upward seepage from river water. Next to upward seepage, water quality was also negatively influenced by storm water run off after an intense rain storm. So, higher river discharges and extreme rainfall deteriorate water quality and indirectly affect biodiversity in urban water systems. Proofing cities for climate change could enhance ecological status of urban waters by implementing measures to decrease local nutrient input from rain storms (e.g. by increase of infiltrating capacity) and upward seepage of nutrient-rich groundwater originating from the rivers Rhine and Meuse. Additionally, when creating water storage ponds and drainage ditches or increasing storage capacity of urban water bodies, attention could also be paid to the construction of natural banks to stimulate vegetation development and to increase suitable habitat for macroinvertebrate species.

Due to the sparse availability of in-situ pore pressure data, a profound understanding and quantification of excess pore pressure development and its influence on subaquatic landslide processes is still missing. In this study, we use glacigenic Lake Villarrica (Chile) as a model basin, in which we document in-situ excess pore pressure, focused fluid escape features and subaquatic slope failures at relatively shallow subsurface depth (<10 m). A subaquatic slope was characterized in great detail by a dense network of high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry and sediment cores. In-situ undrained shear strength and formation pore fluid pressures were documented using free-fall piezocone penetrometer (CPTU) and subsequent pore pressure dissipation tests. We show four independent lines of evidence for overpressure of variable magnitude within the sedimentary slopes: i) pockmarks and other fluid escape features on seismic profiles and bathymetric maps, ii) estimation of ambient in-situ pore pressure via CPTU dissipation tests, iii) underconsolidation and downward decrease in in-situ undrained shear strength within units of uniform lithology, and iv) hydrofractured glacio-lacustrine sediments. Locally, overpressure reaches about 80-90% of the hydrostatic vertical effective stress. We hypothesize that glacier-proximal sediments are strongly underconsolidated and overpressured due to rapid deposition and/or subglacial meltwater pumping. Postglacial consolidation of a thick glacier-proximal unit leads to the upward expulsion of excess pore water. A permeability barrier is formed by the overlying glacio-lacustrine clays and fine silts, focusing these migrating fluids to topographic highs. There, very high overpressure ratios facilitate the development of hydro-fractures, repeated fluid escape and pockmarks on the lake bottom. Overpressure may decrease slope stability in Lake Villarrica in different manners: by focused fluid escape weakening sediments, by generating underconsolidated sequences of low undrained shear strength, and by facilitating static failure. Based on high-quality in-situ data, this study confirms that high overpressure ratios in shallow sediments may be a typical feature at formerly-glaciated marine and lacustrine environments and highlights the major role of pore fluid overpressure for preconditioning subaquatic slopes to failure.

J	Lehtoranta, J; Pitkänen, H				Lehtoranta, J; Pitkänen, H			Binding of phosphate in sediment accumulation areas of the eastern Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationships between P and components binding P were studied by analysing the concentrations of N, P, Fe, Mn, Ca and Al in sediments and pore water along the estuarine transect of the River Neva in August 1995. The high sediment organic matter concentration resulted in low surface redox potential and high pore-water o-P concentration, whereas the abundance of amphipods resulted in high surface redox potentials and low pore-water o-P concentration. However, despite the variation in sediment organic matter and the abundance of amphipods, very reduced conditions and slightly variable concentrations of Tot-P ( 0.7 - 1.1 mg g(-1) DW) were observed in the 10 - 15 cm sediment depth along the estuarine gradient, indicating that the pools of mobile P were largely depleted within the depth of 0 - 15 cm. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that organic matter and Tot-Fe concentration of the sediment were closely related to the variation in Tot-P concentration of the sediments (r(2) = 0.817, n = 32). In addition, the high total Fe: P ratio suggested that there is enough Fe to bind P in sediments along the estuarine gradient. However, low Fe-diss concentrations in the pore water of reduced sediment (redox-potential <- 50 mV) indicated efficient precipitation of FeS (FeS and FeS2), incapable to efficiently bind P. Consequently, the low Fe-diss: o-P ratio (< 1) recorded in pore water in late summer implied that Fe3+ oxides formed by diffusing Fediss in the oxic zone of the sediments were insufficient to bind the diffusing o-P completely. The measured high o-P concentrations in the near-bottom water are consistent with this conclusion. However, there was enough Fediss in pore water to form Fe3+ oxides to bind upwards diffusing P in the oxic sediment layer of the innermost Neva estuary and the areas bioturbated by abundant amphipods.

J	Sommaruga, R; Garcia-Pichel, F				Sommaruga, R; Garcia-Pichel, F			UV-absorbing mycosporine-like compounds in planktonic and benthic organisms from a high-mountain lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We investigated the occurrence, concentration and composition of mycosporines (mycosporine-like amino acids, MAAs) in planktonic organisms and epilithic cyanobacteria from a clear water high-mountain lake situated in the Central Alps, Austria. Two bi-substituted MAAs were identified by HPLC in extracts made of 1996 plankton samples with 90 % aqueous methanol, i.e. asterina-330 (lambda(max) = 330 mm) and shinorine (lambda(max) = 334 nm). Extracts with 20 % aqueous methanol for 2 h at 45 degrees C revealed the additional presence of another MAA tentatively identified as palythine (lambda(max) = 320 nm) in the 1998 planktonic assemblage. In the upper 3 m of the water column the total concentration of MAAs decreased exponentially with depth, but the maxims for both absolute and chlorophyll-a specific concentrations were observed close to the bottom at 8.5 m depth. This was explained by the accumulation of MAAs in the copepod Cyclops abyssorum tatricus that stays in deep water, during daytime. The copepodite III stage contained the 3 MAAs found in phytoplankton but also the mono-substituted compound, mycosporine-glycine (mycosporine-gly: lambda(max) = 310 nm). The concentration of MAAs in C. abyssorum tatricus was highest for shinorine (1.45 % of the dry weight) and lowest for mycosporine-gly (0.02 % of the dry weight). Epilithic cyanobacteria had a more diverse MAA spectrum than plankton, and produced not only asterina-330 and shinorine but also palythinol (lambda(max) = 332 nm), my cosporine-gly and two unidentified compounds with lambda(max) = 330 and 340 nm. The composition and also the relative abundance of the cyanobacterial MAAs changed with depth. Mycosporine-gly was found at the lakeshore where Gloeocapsa sp. dominates, but it was absent at 0.5 and 2.5 m depth dominated by Schizothrix sp. and Tolipothrix sp., respectively. We could not detect any MAAs in the cysts of the red snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis, which develops on top of the winter cover shortly before ice-melt. These results expand to alpine lakes the range of ecosystems in which these compounds may play a significant biological role.

J	Catsadorakis, G; Malakou, M				Catsadorakis, G; Malakou, M			Conservation and management issues of Prespa National Park	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The present article describes the human activities in the area and their changes and trends, given that the contemporary nature conservation key issues are closely related to past and present socio-economic and cultural conditions, both within Prespa itself and outside of it. The liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in its environmental history have been forest clearings and human depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction in the 1960s, its 'discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the mid 1980s. The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an almost 80% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid 1950s increased the population by 40% but in the 1970s emigration reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size. The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s, which twenty years later and along with international changes in production and economy patterns, made possible the present day domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56% decrease in numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for 93% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18% in 1993. Fishing aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly oak and beech-forests are State owned and the rest belong to local municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last 40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20 years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting, angling and poaching cad negatively affect the target species. The construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt ar mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species. The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole. The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use zoning; the diversification and extensification of all fanning activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme.																			0018-8158					AUG 22	1997	351						175	196		10.1023/A:1003093330400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003093330400													WOS:A1997YG80000014
J	Copp, GH				Copp, GH			Microhabitat use of fish larvae and 0(+) juveniles in a highly regulated section of the River Great Ouse	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												To address the scarcity of information on species-environment relationships of fish larvae and of juveniles in regulated rivers, point abundance sampling by electrofishing was used to compare the microhabitat use of seven species of fish in a highly regulated stretch of the River Great Ouse and associated off-channel water bodies during summer 1989. The larvae of dace (Leucisus leuciscus) showed no environmental associations, but 0+ juveniles preferred cooler than average, shallow waters at weak/medium sloped banks where gravel substrates dominated, avoiding dense duckweed, milfoil (Myriophyllum sp.)/Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis) and other submerged vegetation. Both larvae and Of juveniles of gudgeon (Gobio gobio) preferred similar conditions to the dace juveniles, but were found more often than expected in filamentous algae. Juvenile perch (Perca fluviatilis) demonstrated only one preference, the littoral interface between the water and bankside vegetation. Roach (Rutilus rutilus) larvae preferred dense milfoil/pondweed in warmer than average waters over silty bottoms, avoiding the littoral interface, wheras 0+ juveniles preferred cooler than average waters over sand/gravel bottoms at the littoral interface, but avoiding filamentous algae, milfoil/pondweed and other submerged vegetation. The preferences of Of juvenile bream (Abramis brama) were weak but resembled those of juvenile roach. Larvae of silver bream (Blicca bjoerkna) preferred mid-channel areas with dense filamentous algae and milfoil/pondweed, warmer than average waters and silty bottoms, whereas juveniles preferred cooler than average waters at the littoral interface. Silver bream was the only species to show a preference for sunlit locations. The microhabitats of tench (Tinca tinca) larvae and juveniles were nearly identical, preferring the silty bottoms and dense milfoil/pondweed, duckweed and filamentous algae of an off-channel site. The microhabitat of young roach, bream and tench resembled that of these species in a French oxbow lake of the upper River Rhone in France. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Whilst immediate impacts are well studied, we know relatively little about how coastal environments recover in the subsequent years and decades after such events. Here we investigate the response and recovery dynamics of the sedimentary system and biological environment to saltwater inundation into a coastal lake on Chiloe<acute accent> Island, northern Chilean Patagonia, from two tsunamis (in 1960 CE and 2670 cal yr BP) and as a consequence of earthquake-induced land-level change. We utilise an existing unique well-dated sediment record from Lake Huelde containing multiple tsunami inundation events, which provides an exceptional sedimentary archive and opportunity to improve understanding of the impacts of marine inundation on freshwater lake ecosystems by re-examining the sediments for new proxies. Analysis of the geochemistry of lacustrine sediments and the biota (algae, aquatic invertebrates and pollen) preserved within them, shows that the sedimentary and ecological responses to two tsunamis in 1960 CE and 2670 cal yr BP differed in nature and timing. We show that biota responded more immediately to the 2670 cal yr BP event, and impacts were longer lasting; saline anoxic bottom water can prevail for decades to centuries post-inundation. We suggest that key drivers of post-tsunami response and recovery are initially the rate of refreshment after saltwater inundation, and over the longer-term, connectivity to the ocean. In an area affected by earthquake-induced land-level changes, these can influence not only the establishment of sustained connection to the ocean, but can also bring the lake ecosystem within reach of storms and spring high tides, which can impact post-tsunami recovery. We therefore suggest that at Lake Huelde, relative sea (land)-level change, and hence tidal connection of the lacustrine system to the ocean, plays a critical role in ecosystem response.

Temperature models for nitrification and denitrification in lake sediments	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 9	International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology Proceedings				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				During this century the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts the global climate to change significantly with temperature increases of 3 to 5 degrees C in the Danish region, with highest increases in winter (HOUGHTON et al. 2001). Changes in wind climate and hydrology and their effects on temperature and mixing regimes must be modelled to present a complete picture of consequences of climate changes. We focused on the direct effects of temperature on key process rates. In general, the rates of physical, chemical, and biological processes increase with temperature. Chemical equilibrium studies describe temperature influence on process rates as: Q(10) = (mu(1)/mu(2))(10/(Theta 2-Theta 1)) (VAN'T HOFF 1884), where mu(1) and mu(2) are process rates at 2 temperatures Theta(1) and Theta(2), respectively; or by a more theoretically founded expression and introduction of an activation energy: k(T) = Ae(-Ea/RT) (ARRHENIUS 1889), where k(T) is a rate constant at the absolute temperature T, A is a frequency factor, E-a is an activation energy, and R is the gas constant. These equations, however, are only valid over small temperature intervals. Strong deviations occur at low temperatures and especially at high temperatures, where the proteins of enzymes are denaturised. In many studies these exponential equations have been routinely applied, although careful inspections have shown a temperature dependence not statistically different from a simple linear response (COUSSINS & BOWLER 1987, MONTAIGNES et al. 2003). To study the effect of climate changes on the nutrient metabolism in lakes we measured nitrification and denitrification rates over the temperature range 0-60 degrees C in sediment samples from Frederiksborg Castle Lake and applied a number of temperature models to the data. The most predictive model was used to describe the acclimatisation of the processes, and the model was calibrated and verified on sediments from a series of mesocosms run with various climate scenarios.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1384	1388																WOS:000312418900016

GONDWANA RESEARCH												The Lake Alaotra-Ankay rift valley of Central Madagascar forms a NE-SW oriented depression filled with Neogene to recent sediments and is part of a more regional post-Miocene graben system that strikes N-S across much of the central part of the island. The region is characterized by a number of small earthquakes, active hot springs, steep fault-scarp bounded valleys, and several levels of terraces. Young, deeply incised topography related to intense tropical weathering, is largely concentrated near active fault systems. The origin and evolution of this extensional structure and its morphological expressions, however, have not been clearly documented. Mountain front sinuosity values indicate that the eastern side of the rift valley is tectonically more active than the western side, and that rapid erosion under subtropical conditions is causing rapid weathering of fault scarps. The active river network within the Alaotra-Ankay rift shows clear signs of surface re-adjustment to recent tectonic activity. The drainage network is asymmetric, with most channels on the east sides of valleys and controlled by regional eastward tilting. First-order rivers flow parallel to the basin axis. Zones of intense lavaka (erosional gully) formation are correlated with active fault systems and seismicity. Extension in the Ankay-Alaotra rift is oriented roughly the same as in the morphologically similar East African rift system, located only 500 km to the west. The eastern edge of the African continent is moving somewhat independently from the rest of Africa and the portion of the African plate east of the East African rift is regarded as a separate plate, the Somali plate. However, few plate configurations have clearly defined the southern extension of the Africa-Somali plate boundary to where it must join the Southwest Indian Ocean ridge, a necessary requirement of any true microplate bounded by plate boundaries. Instead, the southeast part of the African plate, including the Somali microplate, seems to be dominated by a number of individual rift systems, overall defining a broad diffusive extensional plate boundary. We suggest that this diffusive plate boundary includes one segment that extends off the coast of Africa through the Comores, then cuts through northern Madagascar and extends down the active Ankay-Alaotra rift to the fault-block dominated southeastern coast of Madagascar, then extends southeastward to the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge. Thus, the southeastern part of the African plate is considerably more fragmented by plume-related uplift and diffuse extensional boundaries than previously envisaged.

J	Hülsmann, S; Wagner, A				Huelsmann, Stephan; Wagner, Annekatrin			Multiple defence strategies of Daphnia galeata against predation in a weakly stratified reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 03-09, 2005	Herzberg, SWITZERLAND					In the presence of size-selective fish daphnids were shown to exhibit two alternative inducible defence strategies: They may either escape predation by active migration or adopt a life history strategy, e.g., reproduce earlier and at a smaller size. Depending on the type of habitat, migration may either be vertically (in deep stratified lakes) or horizontally (in shallow lakes with macrophytes) oriented. Concerning behavioural defence strategies, daphnids living in medium-deep, weakly stratified water bodies with a poorly developed littoral face a dilemma, since the littoral provides no shelter and the availability of a deep-water refuge is unpredictable. We studied the population dynamics, life history changes (size at maturity) and daytime vertical distribution of Daphnia galeata in a weakly stratified reservoir in relation to predation by juvenile fish during 6 years. While temperature gradients were usually small, oxygen concentrations suggest that a low-oxygen refuge for daphnids was available in every year to some extent. Our results indicate that, depending on predation intensity and stratification patterns, daphnids exhibit both, behavioural and life history defences. In years with a high biomass of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch Daphnia abundance declined rapidly at the end of the clear water stage while at the same time the vertical distribution at daytime shifted to deep strata providing a low-oxygen refuge and the size at maturity decreased. However, while the life history response in some years lasted throughout most of the summer period, a shift in daytime vertical distribution was exhibited for much shorter periods. Both traits were much less expressed in years with low YOY fish densities and no negative correlation between them could be verified. We suggest that under high predation pressure in this relatively shallow reservoir no strictly alternative (either behavioural or life history) strategies exist, but that daphnids make use of the full range of possible anti-predator defences available, at least during short periods when predation is most intense.

J	Gowda, K; Sridhara, MV				Gowda, Krishne; Sridhara, M. V.			Conservation of tanks/lakes in the Bangalore metropolitan area	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to build up perspectives for the conservation and restoration of the various spoilt water bodies within the Bangalore metropolitan area. Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes how Bangalore city is typical of the features of peninsular India in that it is made up of ridges, valleys and undulating terrain. Monsoon rainfall is substantial and the tanks and lakes can receive and contain substantial amounts of water from rains. Only thing is to de-clog the natural water flow routes and to restore the bunds of tanks and repair the spillways and put in place legal and administrative measures to preserve the interiors of tanks; free them from construction activities and launch suitable afforestation programs to contain soil erosion, improve the quality of subsoil water and raise if possible medicinal and ornamental trees so that Bangalore gains in its aesthetic appeal. Findings - The study reveals that the existence of water bodies is an important asset to the environment of Bangalore. It has a beneficial impact on the microclimate of the city and serves as outdoor recreational areas, which are very much needed as a source of change and relief for the city dwellers. It is good for developing open spaces with greenery along the valleys. There is much scope for water-front developments to enhance urban aesthetics in the surrounding areas. It is possible to improve the ground water table, so that there will be scope for tapping ground water through bore wells all through the year, particularly during summers. Practical implications - This work will draw the attention of government authorities as well as local residents, NGOs and experts to keep the tanks/lakes conserved in and around the BMA and to prevent silting of tanks by offshore development and large-scale tree planting and also removal of encroachments within the study area. Originality/value - This study will stimulate interest in recreation, conservation, open space beautification, pollution abatement and a myriad other ways to improve the quality of urban environment.																			1477-7835	1758-6119					2007	18	2					137	151		10.1108/14777830710725812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/14777830710725812													WOS:000415273400008
J	Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR				Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR			Temporal and spatial dynamics of suspended sediment, nutrients, and algal biomass in Mark Twain Lake, Missouri	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Suspended sediment, nutrients and algal chlorophyll (CHL) were monitored over a 29 month period at 19 sites in Mark Twain Lake, a 7550 ha reservoir in northeastern Missouri. Sampling be an through subsequent periods of average rainfall. Turbid inflows (approximate to 1000 mg/L TSS) during flood events produced consistently high concentrations of suspended sediment (>200 mg/L) and nutrients (TP > 300 mu g/L, TN >2 mg/L) in headwater areas, but effects in the reservoir mainstem varied with thermal regime. Inflows during winter mixing affected the entire waterbody while inflows during stratified periods had little effect on surface strata in the mainstem. Loading of nutrients and sediment to the trophogenic zone thus depended less on quantity of inputs than their timing. The size range of suspended materials initially declined with increasing hydraulic residence time but subsequently increased as organic, presumably, autochthonous seston re placed allochthonous minerals as the dominant particle type. Algal blooms seemed to increase sedimentary loss of mineral seston from the epilimnion. Dynamics of phosphorus and suspended sediment were closely parallel and dominated by fluvial inputs. Dynamics of TN, organic N, nitrate and ammonia, however, seemed equally affected by external inputs and internal cycling and TN exhibited far less year to year variation than TSS or TP. CHL time series revealed numerous brief blooms with little temporal or spatial consistency. Phytoplankton may have become nutrient limited during blooms but were probably light limited except during clear water periods near the start and end of the study. On the basis of growth experiments and maximum areal CHL, algal biomass was probably light limited at irradiances <2-5 E m(-2) d(-1), a range comprising 79 % of our observations. The strong relation between phosphorus and suspended material in Mark Twain Lake holds for other Missouri reservoirs and results in a dome-shaped CHL-TP relation in which phytoplankton are P-limited at low TP (low turbidity) and light limited at high TP (high turbidity). This trend is less evident among Iowa lakes and is probably region-specific.																			0003-9136					DEC	1995	135	2					145	178																WOS:A1995TN68100001

Lowest concentrations occur on slow-weathering igneous rocks (Borrowdale Volcanics); minima of .apprx. 100 .mu.eq Cl- l-1 are similar to the volume-weighted mean for bulk precipitation. At least 10-20% of Na+ is leached from upland catchments, giving Na+/Cl- ratios greater than the equivalent ratio (0.86) in seawater and precipitation. Evapotranspiration at 20-30% annual rainfall accounts for Cl- concentrations in many tarns on igneous rocks but not all; some Cl- may be leached from the rocks in upland catchments and come from groundwaters at low altitudes near the sea. Sea-spray has little influence on tarnwaters near the coast. On sedimentary rocks overall mean Cl- concentrations are 27-73% higher than equivalent means on Borrowdale Volcanics; concentrations of other ions are also higher. A 5- 10-fold range of Cl- concentrations is not simply due to increased evapotranspiration. Na+/Cl- ratios are < 0.86, especially on Skiddaw Slates where tarnwaters contain 10% or more excess Cl- balanced by Ca2+, apparently derived from groundwaters rich in CaCl2. On other sedimentary rocks (Silurian Slates and Carboniferous. Triassic and Permian series) tarnwaters display a similar but less pronounced excess of Cl- and Ca2-+ relative to Na+. Some extra Cl- may be captured by dry deposition on vegtation but a portion, perhaps 15-30% of the total, apparently comes from the rocks or from groundwaters via deep aquifers in contact with seawater or connate water. Anthropogenic sources on the catchments are also considered: deicing salt used on highways in winter accounts for a 27% increase of Cl- in Windermere South Basin over a 20-yr period.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	4					323	352		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00684.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00684.x													WOS:A1983RD37800003

In Upper Lutetian times, the region looked like a hot water sea-side with a broad platform of bio-carbonate sedimentation, where very varied fauna and calcareous algae grew. Later, the sandy-argillaceous deposits increased and swamps surrounded by a thick forest developed. The climate was still hot and wet. Between the Bartonian and the Oligocene, the geography of this region changed. First, the open sea was located in the west of France and soon it moved to the south. The sedimentation was diachronic. Salt-water lakes, with gypsum deposits existed at first in the north and then increased. After that, the nature of the sediments changed, argillaceous muds were deposited in fresh water, in reducing conditions. Later, calcareous muds with a limited fauna of gasteropods, bryozoa, agglutinated and porcellaneous foraminifera were deposited by the sea. The analysis of coastal vegetation indicates a drier environment. Communication with the open sea being easier, a prolific but unvaried fauna of Peneroplidae and Miliolidae gave thanatocoenoses which constituted the large accumulations, particularly in the south. A general regression happened at the end of Oligocene times, marine calcareous muds enclosing a microfauna of small adherent forms were deposited in shallow water where thick vegetation grew. And then, as the sea level fell, a fresh water marsh with carbonate and argillaceous sediments took over. After the installation of a vast shallow marine platform, the region was divided by a few small areas of subsidence which had a complex geography and little contact with the sea. These changes occurred at the same time as the fauna was renewed and the flora indicates a climatic shift.																			0037-9409						1991	162	4					739	751																WOS:A1991GC41800013
J	La Porta, N; Capretti, P				La Porta, N; Capretti, P			Mycosphaerella dearnessii, a Needle-cast Pathogen on Mountain Pine (Pinus mugo) in Italy	PLANT DISEASE												The pathogen Mycosphaerella dearnessii Barr (syn Scirrhia acicola; anamorph Lecanosticta acicola), the causal agent of brown spot needle blight, was observed on Pinus mugo in the Botanical Garden in Gardone (Brescia), on the western side of Garda Lake in northeastern Italy. Symptoms were first noticed in the spring of 1997 by Klaus Lang (University of Freising, Germany). Two years later, all 12 of the P mugo present in the Garden exhibited extensive necrosis, and defoliation of the crown starting from the bottom upward was more prevalent on the shaded portion of infected trees. The trees were about 50 years old and 2.0 to 2.5 m in height. Symptomatic needles were confined to the 2- and 3-year old internodes. Infected needles had several dark to purplish-brown spots surrounded by green tissue and usually had dead tips. Pycnidia and conidia of Lecanosticta acicola were observed. Conidia were 4-celled, curved, pointed at one end and blunt at the other, pale olive-brown and 20 to 30x3 to 4 mu m. The fungus was isolated in pure culture. The pathogen causes serious losses in China, eastern United States, and central and South America, but was observed for the first time in Europe only 30 years ago. It is a major cause of needle blight on several European pine species, especially P sylvestris, P nigra, and P mugo. In the last 7 years, there have been reports of the fungus in pine stands, first in France, Aquitaine, and the western Pyrenees on P radiata (3), and more recently on P mugo in the Alps in Austria (1), Switzerland (2), and southern Germany (4). This record of the fungus near Lake Garda poses a new serious threat especially for the pine plantations of P nigra and P sylvestris in the more humid locations in the Alps, Apennines, and elsewhere in the mountains of southern Europe where the climatic conditions are similar to that of central Europe. This is the first report of M dearnessii on the southern slopes of the Alps and in Italy.

Insights from a synthesis of old and new climate-proxy data from the Pyramid and Winnemucca lake basins for the period 48 to 11.5 cal ka	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					25th Pacific Climate WorkshopProceedings of the 25th Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM)	MAR 06-09, 2011MAR 06-09, 2011	Pacific Grove, CAPacific Grove, CA					A synthesis of old and new paleoclimatic data from the Pyramid and Winnemucca lake basins indicates that, between 48.0 and 11.5.10(3) calibrated years BP (hereafter ka), the climate of the western Great Basin was, to a degree, linked with the climate of the North Atlantic. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) records from Pyramid Lake core PLC08-1 were tied to the GISP2 ice-core record via PSV matches to North Atlantic sediment cores whose isotopic and(or) carbonate records could be linked to the GISP2 6180 record. Relatively dry intervals in the western Great Basin were associated with cold Heinrich events and relatively wet intervals were associated with warm Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) oscillations. The association of western Great Basin dry events with North Atlantic cold events (and vice versa) switched sometime after the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) reached its maximum extent. For example, the Lahontan highstand, which culminated at 15.5 ka, and a period of elevated lake level between 13.1 and 11.7 ka were associated with cold North Atlantic conditions, the latter period with the Youngest Dryas event. Relatively dry periods were associated with the Bolling and Allerod warm events. A large percentage of the LIS may have been lost to the North Atlantic during Heinrich events 1 and 2 and may have resulted in the repositioning of the Polar Jet Stream over North America. The Trego Hot Springs, Wono, Carson Sink, and Marble Bluff tephras found in core PLC08-1 have been assigned GISP2 calendar ages of respectively, 29.9, 33.7, 34.1, and 43.2 ka. Given its unique trace-element chemistry, the Carson Sink Bed is the same as Wilson Creek Ash 15 in the Mono Lake Basin. This implies that the Mono Lake magnetic excursion occurred at approximately 34 ka and it is not the Laschamp magnetic excursion. The entrance of the First Americans into the northern Great Basin is dated to approximately 14.4 ka, a time when the climate was relatively dry. Evidence for human occupation of the Great Basin is lacking for the next 1100 years (y); i.e., the oldest western stemmed point site in the Great Basin dates to 133 ka. Two hypotheses are suggested for this cultural hiatus: (1) the climate had deteriorated to the point that people vacated the Great Basin, or (2) people moved to basin-bottom wetlands that persisted during the dry period, and then the subsequent Younger Dryas wet event erased the archaeological evidence deposited around the low-elevation wetland sites.

Plants, runners and seeds were collected in natural ecosystems as well as in small family orchards where the white-fruited "Chilean strawberry" is cultivated. In the course of the three trips, differences in plant morphological characteristics were found. A first characterization in situ showed three different types. The first corresponds to wild plants that grow on the coast, very close to the shore, where they colonize beaches and sand dunes of the eastern shore of Chiloe island. They have small, bright dark green, coriaceous, hairless leaves and vigorous and at times very long runners, hermaphrodite flowers, and small red fruits. A second type is found normally in the lower elevations of mountain ranges in the regions of Araucania and the Lakes District. In contrast with the first type, the plants are large in size, and the leaves --of a grayish green color-- have abundant trichomes. Flowers are pistillate, staminate or hermaphrodite. The fruit is also red and medium to small in size. The third type corresponds to the white cultivated strawberry, which is mainly found in small orchards of the coastal mountain range in the region of Bio Bio, near of Concepcidn city. Morphologically, this plant resembles the second type. It is vigorous, with hairy leaves, runner and petioles; it is distinguished by its characteristically large, white or pale pink fruit. The achenes are dark and they contrast sharply with the light fruit skin color. These strawberries have an intense aroma and are very sweet--therefore they are highly prized in the local markets.

J	JONES, JG; SIMON, BM				JONES, JG; SIMON, BM			DIFFERENCES IN MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION PROCESSES IN PROFUNDAL AND LITTORAL LAKE-SEDIMENTS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE NITROGEN-CYCLE	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY												An investigation of sediments from the littoral (shallow water) and profundal (deep water) zones of Blelham Tarn [England, UK], a shallow eutrophic lake, showed marked differences in the microbial decomposition processes. The differences were due largely to differences in the degree of oxygenation, supply of electron acceptors and mean summer temperature at the 2 sites. The changes in the hypolimnion (the deep water zone formed on thermal stratification, which may be treated essentially as a closed system) were used to calculate profundal rates of aerobic respiration, NO-3 and SO2-4 reduction, and methanogenesis, relative to the accumulation of CO2. Laboratory measurements demonstrated that NH+4 accumulation, SO2-4 reduction and methanogenesis were more intense in the profundal than in the littoral zone. Anaerobic processes that occurred in the littoral sediments did so at greater depths than in the profundal sediments. The release of CH4 and N2 bubbles also provided estimates of the importance of these processes at the 2 sites. At both sites aerobic respiration was the most important component (about 50%) of C mineralization; SO2-4 reduction was the least important, accounting for only a small percentage of C turnover. Pathways of NO-3 reduction and methanogenesis accounted for approximately equal proportions (varying between 15-25%) of the C mineralized. When the results were adjusted to account for the relative areas of the profundal and littoral zones,the former was the more important site of methanogenesis and SO2-4 reduction; aerobic respiration and NO-3 reduction were greater in the littoral zone. The major end-product of NO-3 reduction was NH+4 in the profundal and N2 in the littoral zone. The higher and continued levels of nitrification, which recycled the NH+4 in the littoral sediments, presumably contribute to this.																			0022-1287						1981	123	APR					297	312																WOS:A1981LR52500013
J	Bano, N; Hollibaugh, JT				Bano, N; Hollibaugh, JT			Diversity and distribution of DNA sequences with affinity to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria of the β subdivision of the class Proteobacteria in the Arctic Ocean	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The spatial distribution and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria of the beta subdivision of the class Proteobacteria (hereinafter referred to as ammonia oxidizers) in the Arctic Ocean were determined. The presence of ammonia oxidizers was detected by PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes using a primer set specific for this group of organisms (nitA and nitB, which amplifies a 1.1-kb fragment between positions 137 and 1234, corresponding to Escherichia coli 16S rDNA numbering). We analyzed 246 samples collected from the upper water column (5 to 235 m) during March and April 1995, September and October 1996, and September 1997. Ammonia oxidizers were detected in 25% of the samples from 5 m, 80% of the samples from 55 m, 88% of the samples from 133 m, and 50% of the samples from 235 m. Analysis of nitA-nitB PCR product by nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) showed that all positive samples contained the same major band (band A), indicating the presence of a dominant, ubiquitous ammonia oxidizer in the Arctic Ocean basin. Twenty-two percent of the samples contained additional major bands. These samples were restricted to the Chukchi Sea shelf break, the Chukchi cap, and the Canada basin; areas likely influenced by Pacific inflow. The nucleotide sequence of the 1.1-kb nitA-nitB PCR product from a sample that contained only band A grouped with sequences designated group 1 marine Nitrosospira-like sequences. PCR-DGGE analysis of 122 clones from four libraries revealed that 67 to 71% of the inserts contained sequences with the same mobility as band A. Nucleotide sequences (1.1 kb) of another distinct group of clones, found only in 1995 samples (25%), fell into the group 5 marine Nitrosomonas-like sequences. Our results suggest that the Arctic Ocean beta-proteobacterial ammonia oxidizers have low diversity and are dominated by marine Nitrosospira-like organisms. Diversity appears to be higher in Western Arctic Ocean regions influenced by inflow from the Pacific Ocean through the Bering and Chukchi seas.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAY	2000	66	5					1960	1969		10.1128/AEM.66.5.1960-1969.2000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.66.5.1960-1969.2000								10788367					WOS:000086805500030

In this paper, molar Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in shells of the ostracod Cypretta brevisaepta Furtos, 1934 were used to reconstruct the late Quaternary palaeolimnology of Wallywash Great Pond, a small freshwater coastal lake in Jamaica, Analyses of modern Jamaican ostracods were undertaken to establish molar distribution coefficients (K-D(M)'s) for this species (K-D(Sr) = 0.306 +/- 0.069; K-D(Mg) = 0.0142 +/- 0.0088). These values were used to reconstruct past levels of (Sr/Ca)(water) and (Mg/Ca)(water) for a 9.23-m lake-sediment core from Wallywash Great Pond. The results were coupled with previously-published stable-isotope (delta(18)O and delta(13)C) determinations on fine-grained calcite, to reconstruct the salinity, palaeohydrology and palaeo-productivity of the lake over the last 125 ka B.P. (10(3) calendar years before present). Three major highstands with slightly elevated salinity occurred during marine isotope stage 5, under elevated sea level and a humid climate. The lake dried out similar to 93.5 ka B.P. as sea level fell and the climate became drier. It refilled around 10.7 ka B.P. Three separate highstands during the Holocene were sustained by humid conditions and high relative sea level. Although there were small increases in salinity during the Holocene when sea level was close to the deepest part of the lake, significant saltwater intrusion appears to have been prevented by freshwater discharge from inland, Throughout the late Quaternary, the salinity of the Great Pond showed low absolute variations, from similar to 0.3 to similar to 0.6 parts per thousand. The long-term trends in lake level reflect both orbitally-induced changes in insolation and eustatic sea level. Water-level fluctuations during the Holocene, however, reflect climatic changes on the millennial timescale rather than orbital forcing or sea-level change.																			0009-2541					JUL 25	1995	124	1-2					143	160		10.1016/0009-2541(95)00032-H	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(95)00032-H													WOS:A1995RP76600014
J	Pecos, R				Pecos, Regis			The history of Cochiti lake from the pueblo perspective	NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL												In the last 30 years, Cochiti Pueblo has been in a fight for their survival culturally, politically, legally, economically, and environmentally. The construction of Cochiti Lake, one of the largest man made lakes in the United States, built by the U.S. Corps of Engineers, devastated nearly all of the available agricultural lands, destroyed the majority of traditional summer homes, drastically changed the ecosystem, and desecrated cherished places of worship. To make matters worse, a few years after closure of the gates that created Cochiti Lake, seepage occurred and put under water the remaining agricultural lands of the Pueblo, creating wetlands and transforming the world of Cochiti overnight. The Cochiti lost their agricultural way of life and have suffered profound consequences as a result. This article is a summary of a presentation for the Utton Transboundary Resources Center, Rio Grande Reservoir Symposium on April 22, 2006, where firsthand experiences of those challenges faced by the Cochiti Pueblo during the last 30 years were shared. From the lawsuit against the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the U.S. government to hold them liable for the destruction, desecration, and devastation, to congressional oversight hearings, the threat of hydro-electric power development, and the debates of religious and cultural protection in Congress, the impacts of the ill-advised development of Town of Cochiti Lake and the 99-year master lease creating the community, to the struggles of management of Cochiti Lake, the long struggle to restore lands destroyed, and the ultimate reconciliation of the Cochiti Pueblo and the Corps of Engineers. The past legal battles, policy debates, rights lost, rights regained, a newly defined relationship between the Corps of Engineers and the Pueblo dictate the present and future mitigation, management issues, and decisions pertaining to Cochiti Lake. Just as the Cochiti Pueblo has regained standing, the issues of the silvery minnow and the drought raise new and equally difficult challenges for the future. In many ways, it is like peeling away a scab and it bleeds all over again.																			0028-0739					SUM	2007	47	3					639	652																WOS:000253613000007
C	McKie, T; Aggett, J; Hogg, AJC		Underhill, JR		McKie, T; Aggett, J; Hogg, AJC			Reservoir architecture of the upper Sherwood Sandstone, Wytch Farm field, southern England	DEVELOPMENT, EVOLUTION AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY OF THE WESSEX BASIN	Geological Society Special Publication				Conference on the Development and Evolution of the Wessex Basin and Adjacent Areas	JUN 27-28, 1995	GEOL SOC BURLINGTON HOUSE, LONDON, ENGLAND	Amoco, Brabant Petr, British Gas, British Petr, Kerr McGee, Jebco	GEOL SOC BURLINGTON HOUSE			The Sherwood Sandstone Group reservoir in the Wytch Farm field comprises a c. 150 m thick succession of arkosic sandstones deposited in a variety of fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian depositional systems. These systems shaw at least three orders of facies variability, which are interpreted to be the depositional response to climatic changes. These comprise a first-order evolutionary trend over the entire Sherwood Sandstone Group from perennial braidplain to ephemeral sheetflood systems to ephemeral lacustrine conditions. This trend culminated in deposition of the Mercia Mudstone Group, and reflects a long-term waning of sand supply and increasing 'flashiness' of the fluvial system. This trend is further subdivided into second-order cycles defined by five areally widespread ftoodplain and lacustrine deposits containing minimal development of fluvial sandstones. These represent widespread, episodic reductions in fluvial sediment supply and rising base level during more 'humid' climatic conditions. These horizons form the basis for the reservoir layering scheme. Each floodplain episode is increasingly more mud-rich upwards through the Sherwood section, and the sand-rich fluvial packages between become systematically more ephemeral in character. Third-order cycles are defined by thin (< 2 m), but areally widespread floodplain and lacustrine horizons which are most readily identifiable in the upper half of the Sherwood section. The sandstones between these cycles are composed of aeolian and sheetflood deposits, but are incised by coarse-grained multistorey-multilateral channel deposits. The incisions are interpreted to be the result of fluvial erosion during dry climatic conditions when lake levels fell and the alluvial plain was devegetated. These incised fluvial deposits form the principal producing intervals in the upper part of the reservoir, particularly in the eastern part of the field. Higher frequency stratigraphic cycles are locally expressed by variations in ephemeral lake levels, palaeosol development and episodic development of wind-blown sand patches. At outcrop, the stratigraphically equivalent Otter Sandstone Formation (c. 100 km to the west) shows comparable evolutionary patterns, albeit with a subtly different facies make-up. The recognition of a hierarchy of climatically driven cycles within the reservoir permits high-resolution correlation and the recognition of subtle, but important, changes in sandbody geometry and connectivity within successive cycles.					; Hogg, Andrew/AAH-9116-2021	HOGG, Andrew Jenner Cowper/0009-0006-8540-3635; 													0305-8719		1-897799-99-3				1998	133						399	406		10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.133.01.21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.133.01.21													WOS:000076760500021
J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON HATCHING TIME OF EGGS OF EPHEMERELLA-IGNITA(PODA) (EPHEMEROPTERA EPHEMERELLIDAE)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Eggs of E. ignita were kept at 8 constant temperatures (range 5.9.degree.-19.8.degree. C) in the laboratory. Of the eggs, > 85% hatched in the temperature range 10.0.degree.-14.2.degree. C but the percentage decreased markedly to 39% at 5.9.degree. C and 42% at 19.8.degree. C. Hatching time (days after oviposition) decreased with increasing water temperature over the range 5.9.degree.-14.2.degree. C and the relationship between the 2 variables was well described by a hyperbola. The time taken for development was expressed in units of degree-days above a threshold temperature. Mean values were 552 (534-573) degree-days above 4.25.degree. C for 10% of the eggs hatched, 862 (725-1064) degree-days above 3.57.degree. C for 50% hatched and 1383 (1294-1486) degree-days above 3.14.degree. C for 90% hatched. These values can be used to predict hatching times at temperatures below 14.68.degree. C for 10% hatched, 14.54.degree. C for 50% hatched and 14.45.degree. C for 90% hatched. At higher temperatures, the hatching time and the number of degree-days required for development both increased with increasing temperature. Equations were developed to estimate the number of degree-days required for development at these higher temperatures. Eggs were placed in the Wilfin Beck, a small stony stream in the English Lake District. Maximum and minimum water temperatures were recorded in each week and the summation of degree-days was used to predict the dates on which 10%, 50% and 90% of the eggs should have hatched. There was good agreement between these estimates and the actual hatching times. Only 10-15% of the eggs hatched between Oct. and late Feb. with most of the eggs hatching in March, April and May. Nymphs hatching in Oct. and Nov. probably did not survive the winter.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	1					51	58		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01425.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01425.x													WOS:A1978EL63300006

Nitrogen dynamics in sediment during water level manipulation on the Upper Mississippi River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Nitrogen (N) has been linked to increasing eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico and as a result there is increased interest in managing and improving water quality in the Mississippi River system. Water level reductions, or 'drawdowns', are being used more frequently in large river impoundments to improve vegetation growth and sediment compaction. We selected two areas of the Upper Mississippi River system (Navigation Pool 8 and Swan Lake) to examine the effects of water level drawdown on N dynamics. Navigation Pool 8 experienced summer drawdowns in 2001 and 2002. Certain areas of Swan Lake have been drawn down annually since the early 1970s where as other areas have remained inundated. In the 2002 Pool 8 study we determined the effects of sediment drying and rewetting resulting from water level drawdown on (1) patterns of sediment nitrification and denitrification and (2) concentrations of sediment and surface water total N (TN), nitrate, and ammonium (NH4+). In 2001, we only examined sediment NH4+ and TN. In the Swan Lake study, we determined the long-term effects of water level drawdowns on concentrations of sediment NH4+ and TN in sediments that dried annually and those that remained inundated. Sediment NH4+ decreased significantly in the Pool 8 studies during periods of desiccation, although there were no consistent trends in nitrification and denitrification or a reduction in total sediment N. Ammonium in sediments that have dried annually in Swan Lake appeared lower but was not significantly different from sediments that remain wet. The reduction in sediment NH4+ in parts of Pool 8 was likely a result of increased plant growth and N assimilation, which is then redeposited back to the sediment surface upon plant senescence. Similarly, the Swan Lake study suggested that drawdowns do not result in long term reduction in sediment N. Water level drawdowns may actually reduce water retention time and river-floodplain connectivity, while promoting significant accumulation of organic N. These results indicate that water level drawdowns are probably not an effective means of removing N from the Upper Mississippi River system. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Holocene seismic activity in south-eastern Switzerland: Evidence from the sedimentary record of Lake Silvaplana	SEDIMENTOLOGY												High-Alpine regions are prone to a large variety of geohazards, among which earthquakes have the strongest impact on landscape and local population. Historic records indicate a moderate to high seismic activity in the northern, south-western and central parts of Switzerland. In contrast, south-eastern Switzerland has less historic earthquake chronicles due to the low population density, resulting in a poorly constrained seismic event catalogue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the palaeoseismic activity for south-eastern Switzerland by using the sedimentary record of Lake Silvaplana in the Engadine Valley. A dense grid of high-resolution two-dimensional seismic profiles, high-resolution bathymetry and a 10 m long sediment core from the deepest basin were used to investigate the stratigraphy of the lake sediments. The bathymetry reveals a flat basin, flanked by steep slopes to the north-west and south-east. The acoustic basement consists of four ridges, and gently-dipping fans to the south-west and north-east. Expressions of slope failure can be identified in all domains of the lake floor and the subsurface data. Multiple coevally-triggered chaotic mass-flow deposits, overlain by megaturbidites with a coarse-sand base, have been detected along ten horizons in the seismic data. The four most recent of these deposits are cored and radiocarbon dated to approximately 230, 310, 960 and 1330 cal yr bp, indicating four over-regional seismic events that triggered large slope failures in Lake Silvaplana in the last 1400 years. Correlation with sediments of Lake Sils, Lake Como, Lake Iseo and Lake Ledro indicate within radiocarbon uncertainties a large earthquake around 1330 cal yr bp. Within their age ranges, the postulated earthquake at 310 cal yr bp (1640 ce) further correlates with a moment magnitude Mw ca 5.4 event in Ftan in 1622 ce, and the 960 cal yr bp (990 ce) earthquake correlates with a Mw ca 5.2 earthquake in Brescia in 1065 ce. Six mass-movement deposits, also suggested to be caused by earthquakes, were not reached by the sediment core and have suggested ages between 7800 and 11 300 cal yr bp. Thus, Lake Silvaplana sediments provide the first reliable record of seismic activity for the mid and Late Holocene in this region, likely related to the neotectonic activity of the Engadine Line, a major fault zone running along the main valley.					; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Fabbri, Stefano Claudio/E-1034-2019	Becker, Lukas W.

Formation of Rotliegend Ca-Cl brines in the North German Basin compared to analogues in the geological record	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The formation of terrestrial Ca-Cl brines is controlled by two major processes: chemical reactions between halite brines and igneous and metamorphic rocks and/or their debris in sedimentary basins, and the abstraction of H2O by evaporation, freezing or formation of hydrous minerals. Albitization dominates in environments of low H2O activity, Le., halite saturated systems. Chloritization, serpentinization and formation of smectites seems to be related to less saline systems, i.e., enhanced water activity. The Rotliegend brines of the North German Basin evolved by interaction of infiltrating halite brines with volcanic debris of the Permian acid volcanic rocks by albitization and chloritization of plagioclase. At present their temperatures are between 130 and 150 degrees C at 3000-4000 m depth. Although they developed in a different environment they chemically and isotopically resemble the basinal brines from the Mississippi Salt Dome basin or even the deep brines from the Red Sea. All these brines have in common that halite brines interacted with plagioclase (An + SiO2 + 2Na(+) double left right arrow 2Alb + Ca2+) or possibly with clay minerals (Ca-clay + 2Na(+) double left right arrow Na-2-clay + Ca2+) at enhanced temperatures. The trends of stable isotopes show slopes in the delta D-delta O-18 diagram which are typical for hydrothermal reactions of evaporation brines with rock or sediments. The genesis of Rotliegend brines differ from Ca-Cl brines in the Canadian Shield, Siberian Platform, the Dry Valleys in Antarctica and even the local brines from the Chilean salars and the Californian Bristol Dry Lake. The Antarctic Dry Valley brines seem to be dominated by melting of ice-cements of their permafrost sections. The Ca-Cl brines of springs in the Chilean salars and the Bristol Dry Lake ascend due to thermal convection along tectonic faults. Although the Canadian Shield brines chemically resemble those of the Siberian Platform their stable isotope fractionation suggest that they developed by different processes of water abstraction. Exotic stable isotope values in brines are gained by freezing or ultrafiltration processes in the precursor sediments of the present crystalline rocks of the Canadian Shield and by small volume ratios of liquids and metamorphic rocks such as of KTB/VB.

ISOTOPIC DATA: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOURCE(S) OF OSIREION GROUNDWATER, ABYDOS, EGYPT	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND RESTORATION STUDIES												Among the many wars which depicted and documented at the ancient Egyptian history, little of them The Osireion, formerly concealed within a West Bank Nile terrace, is thought to have been an important building to the Ancient Egyptians. Its huge building blocks define a rectangular central stone island surrounded by a water-filled channel nearly 13m below the surrounding land surface. The channel was cleared of debris to 4.3m in 1925, but not to its original depth. Westerman (2008) successfully probed to 10.4m using a metal rod. Seismic data suggest its walls may extend 15m below the water table. Westerman listed six questions that elude archeologists and Egyptologists. Why, when and how was the Osireion built? Is in the interior of the island hollow? Why was it built in water? What is the source of the water? Eleven water samples were collected including the Nile, Osireion, two nearby idle dewatering wells, an active eastern French drain and six active water supply wells. delta 18O and delta D were measured by EAEA and PO4, Cl, Na+K and TDS by Sohag University. Factors such as evaporation, mixing, relative humidity, surface elevation and recharge climate can influence isotopic contents. The Nile sample appears most affected by evaporation, consistent with Lake Nasser's great size and arid climate. Water samples fall below the GMWL and paleowater line in a region expected of modern precipitation in arid, low latitude climates. Sinai groundwater by contrast are isotopically lighter, suggestive of recharge at higher elevation during cooler climates. delta 18O, delta D, PO4, Cl, Na+K and TDS concentrations suggest Osireion waters are not easily explained by simple evaporation of any supposed end member. delta 18O and delta D concentrations are strikingly different from two nearby down groundwater gradient, dewatering wells most likely from a mixed source not typical of the ten other samples. Upfllowing from a semi-confined artesian aquifer, possibly also diffuse regional leakage through the Esna Shale are suggested.

IN SEARCH OF TOPONYMIC BORDERS IN BELOZERYE	VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS												The article presents some results of the expedition aimed at documenting toponymic and lexical substratal data in the Lake Beloye area (Belozerye). The survey was carried out in the summer of 2015 in the south-western part of Belozersky District around Lake Andozero, since it had been suggested that in this area there could exist a boundary separating the zone of substratal toponymy of Baltic-Finnic origin (the nearest Vepsian settlements are located in 70 km from the lake) from the zone of substratal toponymy of Volga-Finnic type (Lake Andozero is situated in the upper reaches of the Andoga River which is a part of the Volga basin). The paper draws particular attention to the toponymic determiners derived from landscape terms of substratal origin. Their number and regularity, as well as their ability to serve as area markers make them the most reliable source for the reconstruction of the substratal language of Belozerye. Some of the analysed determiners (-humuz', -solovo) are widespread only in the Lake Beloye area and may be associated with local substratal languages, while others (-loida, -pohta) have parallels in the toponymy of Baltic-Finnic type in the north and north-west of Belozerye. Recent researches hypothesized that, before Slavicization, Belozerye could be a part of the area of the southern group of the Baltic-Finnic languages. The combination within one place-name of structures with "Finnish" and "Sami" etymologies (e.g. Vanosmen', Sundomen', Kiboj, etc.) suggests the existence of a specific language of Baltic-Finnic-Sami type in the Lake Andozero area. Apparently, this must be a Finno-Ugric language belonging to the western group of the Uralic language family which, on the one hand, did not absorb the substratal language ("Palaeo-European", for convenience) serving as a marker of the Sami speech, and, on the other hand, did not fully experience the Germanic influence which played an important role in the formation of the Baltic-Finnic and, to some extent, Sami languages.

J	Stockli, DF; Dumitru, TA; McWilliams, MO; Farley, KA				Stockli, DF; Dumitru, TA; McWilliams, MO; Farley, KA			Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the White Mountains, California and Nevada	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The White Mountains represent the westernmost range of the central northern Basin and Range province. They are situated to the east of the unextended Sierra Nevada and represent a crustal block that is bounded along its western flank by the high-angle White Mountains fault zone. The fault zone accommodates up to similar to8 km of total dip-slip displacement. Investigation of the structural and thermal history of the White Mountains indicates a two-stage Cenozoic tectonic evolution. Preextensional Miocene volcanic rocks preserved along the eastern side of the range unconformably overlie Mesozoic granitic basement and currently dip up to 25degrees to the east, recording the total Cenozoic tilt of the crustal block. Apatite fission-track and (U-Th/He) thermochronological data indicate that the White Mountains underwent rapid exhumation and eastward tilting in the middle Miocene, starting at ca. 12 Ma. Geologic mapping (1: 10,000), fault kinematic analysis, and dating of younger volcanic sequences show that following middle Miocene east-west extension, the White Mountains have been dominated by right-lateral transtensional deformation related to the Walker Lane belt. The eruption of late Miocene and Pliocene volcanic sequences in the eastern White Mountains postdates the majority of the uplift of the range, as evidenced by in-filling of paleodrainages and the presence of east-directed flow fabrics. Fault kinematic indicators from the White Mountains fault zone are characterized by apparent overprinting of dip-slip fault-motion indicators by right-lateral slickenfibers and fault striations, demonstrating that the range-bounding fault system along the western side of the White Mountains was reactivated as a dextral strike-slip fault system. At the northern and southern ends of the range, Pliocene right-lateral transtension along this northwest-southeast-trending fault systems resulted in the formation of northeast-trending pull-apart basins that truncate the mountain range and transfer strike-slip displacement eastward from the Owens Valley fault zone to the Fish Lake Valley fault zone. The inception of strike-slip faulting in Fish Lake Valley occurred at ca. 6 Ma as constrained by late Miocene volcanic units. Right-lateral faulting on the western side of the White Mountains occurred at ca. 3 Ma and is distinctly younger than the faulting in the Fish Lake Valley area, indicating a westward migration of transcurrent deformation through time.					; Stockli, Daniel/N-8868-2015; McWilliams, Michael/A-9548-2011; Farley, Kenneth/AAE-7735-2020	McWilliams, Michael/0000-0002-4107-7069; Stockli, Daniel/0000-0001-7652-2129; Farley, Kenneth/0000-0002-7846-7546; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL	2003	115	7					788	816		10.1130/0016-7606(2003)115<0788:CTEOTW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2003)115<0788:CTEOTW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000183770800002
J	Fang, X; Stefan, HG				Fang, X; Stefan, HG			Temperature variability in lake sediments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Sediment temperatures were simulated from the sediment-water interface down to 10 m for circular lakes with surface areas of 0.2-10 km(2) and maximum lake depths of 4-24 m. The calculations were made using daily weather conditions measured over 19 years (1961-1979) at three geographic locations, representing climate conditions from north to south latitudes in the central United States. A one-dimensional sediment temperature model coupled with a year-round lake water temperature model (MINLAKE96) was used. The models were tested against extensive water temperature and some sediment temperature data. Lake sediment equilibrium temperatures at 10 m below the water-sediment interface were found almost equal to the annual mean temperature of the overlaying water and hence dependent on the lake temperature regime, which in turn depends on the local climate and a lake's physical characteristics (e.g., surface area A(s), maximum depth H-MAX, and water transparency as measured by Secchi depth). The lake geometry ratio A(s)(0.25)/H-MAX (m(-0.5)) gives a good indication whether a lake will permanently stratify in summer or not, and that makes a large difference for the sediment temperature regime. Sediment temperatures at 10 m below the littoral waters of a lake are almost equal to subsurface ground (terrestrial) temperatures, regardless of the type of lake, whereas sediment temperatures at 10 m below the deepest portion of a stratified lake have a strong linear relationship with the logarithm of the lake geometry ratio. Two generalized 10-m sediment temperature profiles were developed, one for ice-covered lakes and the other for year-round open water lakes. Sediment temperatures at 10 m below the sediment-water interface at different depths of a lake can be reconstructed from the generalized profiles using Secchi depth, surface area, maximum depth, and annual mean air temperature as input. Sediment temperature at several meters depth (e.g., 10 m) below a lake bed is a useful and necessary initial condition to predict water temperature dynamics in lakes of the temperate zone and hence other water quality parameters whose kinetics are linked to water temperature.																			0043-1397					APR	1998	34	4					717	729		10.1029/97WR03517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97WR03517													WOS:000072816600015

Linking Canadian Harvested Juvenile American Black Ducks to Their Natal Areas Using Stable Isotope (δD, δ13C, and δ15N) Methods	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Understanding source-sink dynamics of game birds is essential to harvest and habitat management but acquiring this information is often logistically and financially challenging using traditional methods of population surveys and banding studies. This is especially true for species such as the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes), which have low breeding densities and extensive breeding ranges that necessitate extensive surveys and banding programs across eastern North America. Despite this effort, the contribution of birds fledged from various landscapes and habitat types within specific breeding ranges to regional harvest is largely unknown but remains an important consideration in adaptive harvest management and targeted habitat conservation strategies. We investigated if stable isotope (delta D, delta 13C, delta 15N) could augment our present understanding of connectivity between breeding and harvest areas and so provide information relevant to the two main management strategies for black ducks, harvest and habitat management. We obtained specimens from 200 hatch-year Black Duck wings submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Service Species Composition Survey. Samples were obtained from birds harvested in Western, Central, and Eastern breeding/harvest subregions to provide a sample representative of the range and harvest rate of birds harvested in Canada. We sampled only hatch-year birds to provide an unambiguous and direct link between production and harvest areas. Marine origins were assigned to 12%, 7%, and 5% of birds harvested in the Eastern, Central, and Western subregions, respectively. In contrast, 32%, 9%, and 5% of birds were assigned, respectively, to agricultural origins. All remaining birds were assigned to nonagricultural origins. We portrayed probability of origin using a combination of Bayesian statistical and GIS methods. Placement of most eastern birds was western Nova Scotia, eastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and southern Newfoundland. Agricultural birds from the Central region were consistent with the Saguenay region of Quebec and the eastern claybelt with nonagricultural birds originating in the boreal. Western nonagricultural birds were associated with broad boreal origins from southern James Bay to Lake of the Woods and east to Cochrane, Ontario. Our work shows that the geographic origins, landscape, and habitat associations of hatch-year Black Ducks can be inferred using this technique and we recommend that a broad-scale isotopic study using a large sample of Canadian and US harvested birds be implemented to provide a continental perspective of source-sink population dynamics.

(C-14 age) during the climactic eruption of the volcanic edifice known as Mount Mazama, is intermediate in size between small calderas associated with central vent eruptions and large calderas that have ring fracture vent systems. Our quantitative study of lithic fragments in the ejecta confirms the existing model of changes in vent configuration during the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama. Initial activity was from a single vent that produced a rhyodacite pumice fall from a Plinian column. Altered preexisting volcanic rocks are the predominant lithic type in the Plinian deposit, and their extensive hydrothermal alteration is considered as evidence of their relatively deep origin. The Wineglass Welded Tuff lies atop the Plinian deposit and contains a higher proportion of fresh volcanic rocks, suggesting enlargement of the single vent by slumping of its walls. This same vent enlargement caused the Plinian eruption column to collapse and feed valley-hugging pyroclastic flows that deposited the Wineglass Welded Tuff. When enough material was erupted from the shallow magma chamber that its roof was no longer adequately supported, Mount Mazama collapsed to form the caldera, while highly energetic pyroclastic flows produced the climactic ignimbrite. A lag breccia that represents the proximal facies of the compositionally zoned climactic ignimbrite lies atop the Wineglass Welded Tuff and contains predominantly altered volcanic rocks of deeper origin, accompanied by minor granitoids from the magma chamber walls. Azimuthal differences in lithic component proportions in the lag breccia correlate well with the geology of the caldera walls, indicating that the climactic ignimbrite was ejected by multiple vents along a ring fracture system. Systematic lithic component changes within the lag breccia suggest different quarrying levels that reflect waxing and waning of the discharge rate during the caldera collapse phase of the climactic eruption. Our lithic component analysis demonstrates that calderas that may be too small to experience structural resurgence, such as Crater Lake, nevertheless may form by syneruptive subsidence along ring fractures.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				AUG 10	1993	98	B8					14059	14074		10.1029/93JB00934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JB00934													WOS:A1993LT33700016

Hurricane Harvey Impacts on Water Quality and Microbial Communities in Houston, TX Waterbodies	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Extreme weather events can temporarily alter the structure of coastal systems and generate floodwaters that are contaminated with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB); however, every coastal system is unique, so identification of trends and commonalities in these episodic events is challenging. To improve our understanding of the resilience of coastal systems to the disturbance of extreme weather events, we monitored water quality, FIB at three stations within Clear Lake, an estuary between Houston and Galveston, and three stations in bayous that feed into the estuary. Water samples were collected immediately before and after Hurricane Harvey (HH) and then throughout the fall of 2017. FIB levels were monitored by culturing E. coli and Enterococci. Microbial community structure was profiled by high throughput sequencing of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Water quality and FIB data were also compared to historical data for these water body segments. Before HH, salinity within Clear Lake ranged from 9 to 11 practical salinity units (PSU). Immediately after the storm, salinity dropped to < 1 PSU and then gradually increased to historical levels over 2 months. Dissolved inorganic nutrient levels were also relatively low immediately after HH and returned, within a couple of months, to historical levels. FIB levels were elevated immediately after the storm; however, after 1 week, E. coli levels had decreased to what would be acceptable levels for freshwater. Enterococci levels collected several weeks after the storm were within the range of historical levels. Microbial community structure shifted from a system dominated by Cyanobacteria sp. before HH to a system dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes immediately after. Several sequences observed only in floodwater showed similarity to sequences previously reported for samples collected following Hurricane Irene. These changes in beta diversity corresponded to salinity and nitrate/nitrite concentrations. Differential abundance analysis of metabolic pathways, predicted from 16S sequences, suggested that pathways associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance were elevated in floodwater. Overall, these results suggest that floodwater generated from these extreme events may have high levels of fecal contamination, antibiotic resistant bacteria and bacteria rarely observed in other systems.					; Zhang, Yan/L-1738-2015; Allen, Michael/NBX-3528-2025; LaMontagne, Michael/A-5534-2010	zhang, yan/0000-0001-5784-4659; Allen, Michael/0000-0003-2293-8078; 														1664-302X				JUN 14	2022	13								875234	10.3389/fmicb.2022.875234	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.875234								35774461					WOS:000817136600001
J	Laabs, BJC; Kaufman, DS				Laabs, BJC; Kaufman, DS			Quaternary highstands in Bear Lake Valley, Utah and Idaho	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Surficial deposits in Bear Lake Valley, Utah and Idaho, demonstrate that Bear Lake and its surrounding wetlands expanded and contracted several times during the Quaternary Period. Deposits in 40 outcrops and the geomorphology of the valley were studied to reconstruct the water-level history. Temporal control was provided by amino acid geochronology on 29 samples of aquatic mollusks, calibrated by C-14 dating and tephrochronology. Samples of three molluscan genera were heated and analyzed to determine intergeneric differences in aspartic (Asp) and glutamic (Glu) acid racemization. The covariance of Asp and Gin racemization in these genera was used to identify aberrant amino acid analyses. The rate of Glu racemization was calibrated by using a parabolic model that was used to estimate sample ages. Although the paucity of exposures, uncertainty of the depositional setting, and postdepositional uplift of deposits hamper an accurate reconstruction of water level in Bear Lake Valley, several conclusions can be drawn. During the middle Pleistocene, lacustrine or wetland environments in northern Bear Lake Valley may have extended up to 1830 masl (meters above sea level; similar to6000 ft) twice between ca. 1000-100 ka (Bear Hollow phase). During the late Pleistocene, the shoreline of Bear Lake transgressed at least three times: (1) to 1817 masl (similar to5960 ft) at 47-39 cal. (calendar-year-corrected) ka (Jensen Spring phase); (2) to 1814 masl (5950 ft) at ca. 16-15 cal. ka (Raspberry Square phase); and (3) to 1814 masl at ca. 9 cal. ka (Willis Ranch phase). Bear River currently bypasses Bear Lake, but flowed into the lake during high-stands and allowed the water level to rise to the valley threshold at Nounan narrows. Water levels have lowered to 1806 masl (5923 ft) since the middle Pleistocene, likely because of downcutting by Bear River at Nounan narrows. Because downcutting at Nounan narrows controls the maximum attainable water level in Bear Lake Valley, effects of climate change on lake level are limited, and Bear Lake may actually have been smaller than today when Lake Bonneville transgressed to its maximum shoreline during the Last Glacial Maximum.

J	BIBBY, HM; BENNIE, SL; STAGPOOLE, VM; CALDWELL, TG				BIBBY, HM; BENNIE, SL; STAGPOOLE, VM; CALDWELL, TG			RESISTIVITY STRUCTURE OF THE WAIMANGU, WAIOTAPU, WAIKITE AND REPOROA GEOTHERMAL AREAS, NEW-ZEALAND	GEOTHERMICS												Electrical resistivity measurements have been used to investigate a 650 km(2) region containing four separate areas of geothermal surface activity: Waimangu, Waiotapu, Waikite and Reporoa. Measurements were made using the Schlumberger array with fixed spacings (AB/2) of 500 m (1167 measurements) and 1000 m (720 measurements). The data outline an area of over 100 km(2) where near surface electrical resistivity is less than 30 Omega m; the most extensive low resistivity region known in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). Within this large area, three smaller zones of resistivity less than 10 Omega m can be distinguished which contain the geothermal activity of Waimangu, Waiotapu and Reporoa. A fourth area of surface geothermal activity, Waikite, lies about 5 km to the west of the Waiotapu Springs, and is separated from them by the high elevation Paeroa Range. Interpretation of the resistivity measurements suggests a single deep source for the geothermal fluid discharged at both Waiotapu and Waikite, that lies beneath the high elevation ground. This Waiotapu-Waikite system straddles a northwest-southeast drainage divide, and thus subsurface movement of geothermal waters occurs to both the north and south, masking the northern and southern extent of the deeper parts of the system. The Waimangu Geothermal Field, as outlined by the resistivity data, is much more extensive than indicated by the distribution of surface features. The field is characterised by abrupt resistivity discontinuities to the north, west and east, with the northern boundary crossing Lake Rotomahana. It is not possible to identify a southern boundary to Waimangu because of the masking effects of the near surface movement of geothermal fluids from Waiotapu. The resistivity signature of the Reporoa thermal area is not consistent with the commonly accepted model in which the Reporoa thermal waters originate as groundwater drainage from Waiotapu. The sharp boundaries to the resistivity anomaly, and the resistivity variation with depth at Reporoa, are quite different from the region between the Reporoa and Waiotapu. These characteristics, observed in many geothermal systems in the TVZ, suggest that the resistivity anomaly marks an independent geothermal system at Reporoa.

J	Foley, JA; Coe, MT; Scheffer, M; Wang, GL				Foley, JA; Coe, MT; Scheffer, M; Wang, GL			Regime shifts in the Sahara and Sahel: Interactions between ecological and climatic systems in northern Africa	ECOSYSTEMS												The Sahara and Sahel regions of northern Africa have complex environmental histories punctuated by sudden and dramatic "regime shifts" in climate and ecological conditions. Here we review the current understanding of the causes and consequences of two environmental regime shifts in the Sahara and Sahel. The first regime shift is the sudden transition from vegetated to desert conditions in the Sahara about 5500 years ago. Geologic data show that wet environmental conditions in this region-giving rise to extensive vegetation, lakes, and wet-lands-came to an abrupt end about 5500 years ago. Explanations for climatic changes in northern Africa during the Holocene have suggested that millennial-scale changes in the Earth's orbit could have caused the wet conditions that prevailed in the early Holocene and the dry conditions prevalent today. However, the orbital hypothesis, by itself, does not explain the sudden regime shift 5500 years ago. Several modeling studies have proposed that strong, nonlinear feedbacks between vegetation and the atmosphere could amplify the effects of orbital variations and create two alternative stable states (or "regimes") in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara: a "green Sahara" and a "desert Sahara." A recent coupled atmosphere-ocean-land model confirmed that there was a sudden shift from the "green Sahara" to the "desert Sahara" regime approximately 5500 years ago. The second regime shift is the onset of a major 30-year drought over the Sahel around 1969. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the interactions between atmosphere and vegetation act to reinforce either a "wet Sahel" or a "dry Sahel" climatic regime, which may persist for decades at a time. Recent modeling studies have indicated that the shift from a "wet Sahel" to a "dry Sahel" regime was caused by strong feedbacks between the climate and vegetation cover and may have been triggered by slow changes in either land degradation or sea-surface temperatures. Taken together, we conclude that the existence of alternative stable states (or regimes) in the climate and ecosystems of the Sahara and Sahel may be the result of strong, nonlinear interactions between vegetation and the atmosphere. Although the shifts between these regimes occur rapidly, they are made possible by slow, subtle changes in underlying environmental conditions, including slow changes in incoming solar radiation, sea-surface temperatures, or the degree of land degradation.

Lake water was collected from 31 lakes along an elevation transect and diatoms were isolated from lake sediment from one lake (Mica Lake) in south Alaska. In general, delta W values from coastal lakes overlap the global meteoric water line (GMWL). delta W values from interior lakes do not lie on the GMWL; they fall on a local evaporation line trajectory suggesting source isotopes are depleted with respect to maritime lakes. Sediment cores were recovered from 58 m depth in Mica Lake (60.96A degrees N, 148.15A degrees W; 100 m asl), an evaporation-insensitive lake in the western Prince William Sound. Thirteen calibrated C-14 ages on terrestrial macrofossil samples were used to construct an age-depth model for core MC-2, which spans 9910 cal years. Diatoms from 46, 0.5-cm-thick samples were isolated and analyzed for their oxygen isotope ratios. The analyses employed a newly designed, stepwise fluorination technique, which uses a CO2 laser-ablation system, coupled to a mass spectrometer, and has an external reproducibility of +/- 0.2aEuro degrees. delta O-18(diatom) values from Mica Lake sediment range between 25.2 and 29.8aEuro degrees. delta O-18(diatom) values are relatively uniform between 9.6 and 2.6 ka, but exhibit a four-fold increase in variability since 2.6 ka. High-resolution sampling and analyses of the top 100 cm of our lake cores suggest large climate variability during the last 2000 years. The 20th century shows a +4.0aEuro degrees increase of delta O-18(diatom) values. Shifts of delta O-18(diatom) values are likely not related to changes in diatom taxa or dissolution effects. Late Holocene excursions to lower delta O-18(diatom) values suggest a reduction of south-to-north storm trajectories delivered by meridional flow, which likely corresponds to prolonged intervals when the Aleutian Low pressure system weakened. Comparisons with isotope records of precipitation (delta P) from the region support the storm-track hypothesis, and add to evidence for variability in North Pacific atmospheric circulation during the Holocene.					; Kaufman, Darrell/A-2471-2008	Sharp, Zachary/0000-0003-1902-5542; Dodd, Justin P./0000-0002-2964-3566													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2009	41	1					189	208		10.1007/s10933-008-9261-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9261-z													WOS:000262505400013
J	Dam, RAC; Fluin, J; Suparan, P; van der Kaars, S				Dam, RAC; Fluin, J; Suparan, P; van der Kaars, S			Palaeoenvironmental developments in the Lake Tondano area (N. Sulawesi, Indonesia) since 33,000 yr BP	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Geo(morpho)logical, sedimentological. and ecological developments in the Lake Tondano area since +/- 33,000 yr BR, and limnological changes in the moderately-sized lake situated at 680 m asl in the northern part of Sulawesi, Indonesia are discussed. First, the environmental setting of the lake is presented. Study of the regional distribution of lacustrine sediments, and a detailed analysis of their sedimentary facies (texture, organic matter content) suggest major changes in size and depth of the lake and in past sedimentation. Insight into the long-term development of the lake (sedimentation processes) is highly relevant for sustainable use of the present lake. Analysis of diatom assemblages provides further detail of the changing aquatic settings of the lake; lake levels rise quickly around 33,000 and 12,000 yr B.P., fall dramatically between +/- 30,000 and 13,000 yr B.P. and are lowered gradually since approximately 6000 yr B.P., following Early Holocene high lake levels. Drainage of the lake is affected by both volcanic depositional events and regional climatic events. Palynological analysis is indicative of local palaeoecological settings in the lake area and regional climatic change; a distinct, Late Pleistocene phase, with lower precipitation and lowered mean temperatures is inferred. Furthermore, progressive deforestation of the Tondano uplands is evident, as well as diffuse anthropogenic/volcanic vegetation disturbance from the early Mid Holocene onwards. Information from sedimentary facies, diatom assemblages and local palaeoecology (pollen) are integrated to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental settings and processes in the lake area. This record of environmental change as well as the pollen-based record of regional vegetation and climate change corroborates other palaeoenvironmental data derived from the few terrestrial sites in the region, The data attribute a greater magnitude of temperature and precipitation change in the region than is commonly deduced in studies based on marine faunal and sedimentary records. The Lake Tondano sedimentary record is highly suitable for further analysis aimed at determining the exact timing and amplitudes of environmental change in the SE Asian equatorial region.

Two Contrasting H2O-rich Components in Primary Melt Inclusions from Mount Shasta	JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY												In addition to the abundant andesite and dacite lavas of the Mt. Shasta stratocone, primitive mafic lavas have erupted during the Quaternary from the Mt. Shasta region. Two types of basic lavas are the focus of this study: nearly anhydrous high-aluminium olivine tholeiites, produced by decompression melting, and basaltic andesites, produced by melting of a metasomatized mantle source (i.e. modified by various amounts of H2O-rich components). Here we provide further insight into the origin and the coexistence of these two types of magma based on a detailed study of the dissolved volatile contents in melt inclusions trapped in magnesium-rich olivine crystals from both tholeiites and basaltic andesites. The melt inclusions fall on the primitive extension of their respective host lava compositions: (1) the tholeiite melt inclusions are nearly anhydrous melts with low and clustered volatiles compositions; (2) the basaltic andesite melt inclusions are 'wet' melts with higher and more variable volatile contents (up to 2 center dot 6 wt% H2O, 820 ppm CO2, 1270 ppm Cl, 1220 ppm F and 6280 ppm S) than those of the tholeiite melt inclusions. The basaltic andesite melt inclusions are enriched in fluid-mobile elements and in incompatible trace elements: they display a stronger signature of slab-derived components than their host lavas. The selective enrichment of the basaltic andesite melt inclusions in fluid-mobile elements such as K, F, Cl, Ba and B as well as their contrasting delta B-11 (from -10 center dot 2 +/- 1 center dot 3 parts per thousand to -3 center dot 2 +/- 0 center dot 9 parts per thousand for the melt inclusions from sample 95-15 and from -4 center dot 9 +/- 1 center dot 1 parts per thousand to +4 center dot 4 +/- 1 center dot 1 parts per thousand for the melt inclusions from samples 85-1a and 85-47) show the imprints of two distinct slab-derived components C1 and C2. Using trace element ratios, we modelled the compositions of these two H2O-rich components (C1 with Cl/F of 1 center dot 1 is rich in both in high field strength elements and incompatible trace elements, whereas C2 with Cl/F of 4 center dot 0 is poorer in trace elements) and show that they represent mixing between sediment melts and dehydration fluids from the altered oceanic crust.

High energy dissipation rates with oscillatory fluid-flow velocities of +/-0.05m/sec were observed above the sediment-water interface at the depth of 12 m. Although the take exhibits periods with thermal polymixis, dissolved oxygen (DO) usually exhibits a year-to-year summer clinograde DO pattern with anaerobic conditions typically encountered below 5 m to 6 in depth. In 2001, the lake was weakly dimictic with a turbulent benthic boundary layer dominated by anaerobic conditions with a pH range from 7.2 to 8.4. The concentration of P-affinity metals in the sediments ranged from 1.5 to 16.1 mg(.)g(-1), represented by Fe, Al, and Ca. The lake has relatively low P-affinity metal concentrations in the sediments, implying a low holding capacity of P. Phosphorus flux at the sediment-water interface was mediated by DO concentrations in the water column. Under aerobic conditions, no release flux of phosphorus was observed in the water column. Under anaerobic conditions, the measured release flux of P from the sediments to the overlying water was 16.93 mg(.)m(-2.)day(-1). A sediment P dynamic model was used to predict conduct long-term P internal loading in the lake. If organic loading to the lake sediments continues at the rate observed in the recent past, the internal loading of P was predicted to nearly double in the next 30 years. The reduction in the organic loading of 1%, 5%, 10% and 25% will achieve reductions in the P internal loading to 9.7, 3.0, 0.7, and 0 mg(.)m(-2.)day(-1), respectively. Hence, future lake management options may focus on incrementally reducing internally derived P loading that will, in turn, reduce organic loading within Jessie Lake.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				DEC	2004	20	4					333	346		10.1080/07438140409354162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354162													WOS:000226448700007

However, these remote environments do not have sufficiently long instrumental climate records to support studies on contemporary climate change. The issue of the scarcity of instrumental climate data at remote regions is addressed by reconstructing monthly mean air temperatures from 1781 to 1997 AD at eleven remote alpine and arctic lakes in Europe, as part of the MOuntain LAke Research ( MOLAR) project. Stepwise multiple regression is applied to establish linear transfer functions of temperatures between each of eleven upland records and twenty homogenised long lowland records. Twelve monthly transfer functions are obtained for each lake. The skill of these transfer functions is found to range typically between 60 and 99%. The lower skill values generally correspond to winter months. The temperature reconstructions obtained using the transfer functions need to be corrected with vertical temperature gradients. Air-temperature lapse rates were obtained for each lake region by spatial interpolation of radiosonde air-temperature data ( 1990 1997). The resulting reconstructions at each lake were checked using air-temperature data ( 1996 1997) from automatic weather stations installed at the lakes during the MOLAR project. We estimate the typical reconstruction errors to be about 1.3degreesC for low-sun months and about 0.98degreesC for high-sun months. Trend analyses on the reconstructed annual mean air temperatures at the lakes show two distinct types of trends for the 19th and 20th centuries. During the period 1801 1900, the western European lakes show no significant trend whereas annual mean air temperatures at the eastern European lakes decrease significantly. The period 1901 1997 presents a warming trend at all but the Fennoscandian lakes. Our results are in good agreement with previous studies on the spatial distribution and magnitude of temperature change in Europe. Principal component analysis performed on the reconstructed annual mean air temperature reveals two different regimes of trends for the past two centuries. It also allows a regional clustering of the inter-annual variability of air temperature at the lakes to be identified.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2002	28	1					7	23		10.1023/A:1020363700397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020363700397													WOS:000178212200002

Therefore, it represents an important aquatic habitat in the region that also provides invaluable ecosystem services for the local communities. To improve our knowledge of the lake's ecosystem and the use of disarticulated ostracod valves and preserved carapaces, micro-crustacean remains commonly used in palaeolimnology and palaeoceanography, as proxies for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, and to examine the post-mortem dispersal of ostracod remains, 68 surface-sediment samples were collected from the lake bottom in 2012 and analysed for the ostracod assemblages. Both, the noded and smooth, forms of Cyprideis torosa dominate in the Sea of Galilee, with the former more abundant than the latter. Relatively abundant and found at half of the 68 sampling locations or more, are also Ilyocypris hartmanni, I. cf. nitida, Darwinula stevensoni and Neglecandona angulata. In addition, ten less abundant ostracod taxa were recorded in the lake. Of all 15 taxa recorded in our study, ten were also recorded in a study of the Sea of Galilee's ostracod fauna conducted already in the 1960s. The newly recorded five taxa are relatively rare, and they were mostly found in the region of the Jordan River delta or near the southeastern shore of the lake which were not included in the survey of the 1960s. Thus, there is no evidence for a significant change in the ostracod fauna of the lake over the last half-century. In comparison to the ostracod assemblage from a late Pleistocene archaeological excavation site at the southwestern margin of the lake, the assemblage from the recent survey is slightly less diverse, probably because of the long duration of ca. 5000 years integrated by the sedimentary section of the archaeological site and also due to nearby freshwater inflows from which valves and carapaces were probably washed to the site's location. Our study also shows that ostracod valves and carapaces are typically relatively abundant in most of the surface-sediment samples collected from locations at 18 m or shallower. In contrast, very few valves and carapaces were recorded at depths greater than 18 m, which is a zone affected by seasonal anoxia in the Sea of Galilee. These few ostracod remains were apparently transported by currents and waves to the central, deeper part of the lake, but their low number shows that such post-mortem dispersal of ostracod remains is insignificant in the deeper part of the lake. Thus, our study provides support for palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimate reconstructions based on ostracod records from single sediment cores obtained from depths unaffected by post-mortem transport and seasonal or permanent anoxia.

J	Froidefond, JM; Castaing, P; Prud'homme, R				Froidefond, JM; Castaing, P; Prud'homme, R			Monitoring suspended particulate matter fluxes and patterns with the AVHRR/NOAA-11 satellite: application to the Bay of Biscay	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												AVHRR/NOAA-11 satellite images of the C1 (580-680 nm) and C2 (725-1100 nm) channels were used to quantify the suspended particulate matter discharged into the ocean by the Gironde estuary (France). The calibration method is based on a comparison between satellite values (AVHRR reflectances) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations at the sea surface, measured in situ. To correct the aerosol variations a C1-C2 image subtraction is applied. However, when the SPM concentration is greater than about 15 mg l(-1), the C2 channel image is affected by water turbidity and the C1-C2 correction cannot be used. The C1 channel is more sensitive, and we were able to distinguish SPM concentration variations greater than 0.5 mg l(-1). A subtraction of two images recorded with a 24 h interval was carried out to evaluate vertical and horizontal fluxes. The residual image shows the quantity of particles leaving the surface layer. To assess horizontal displacements, turbid fronts were mapped by means of an image gradient analysis. Major and minor fronts recorded each day, superimposed to outline displacements (gradients and orientations), were displaced from the Gironde estuary to the West and the Northwest. During the ECOFER cruises (1989-1991), several AVHRR scenes were processed using an atmospheric correction based on the low SPM concentrations ("ocean pixel subtraction"). Generally, surface particulate matter is confined to the inner continental shelf. Higher values were observed during the ECOFER 4 cruise. Suspended particulate matter concentrations with the maximum extension appeared during the ECOFER 1 cruise. Concentrations were very low during the ECOFER 5 cruise, even in the lower estuary. This was due to low summer discharges that occurred during the dry period of 1988-1991 in France. During these surveys, estimated SPM concentrations were less than 1.5 mg l(-1) in the ECOFER area.

Examination of Surface Temperature Modification by Open-Top Chambers along Moisture and Latitudinal Gradients in Arctic Alaska Using Thermal Infrared Photography	REMOTE SENSING												Passive warming manipulation methodologies, such as open-top chambers (OTCs), are a meaningful approach for interpretation of impacts of climate change on the Arctic tundra biome. The magnitude of OTC warming has been studied extensively, revealing an average plot-level warming of air temperature that ranges between 1 and 3 degrees C as measured by shielded resistive sensors or thermocouples. Studies have also shown that the amount of OTC warming depends in part on location climate, vegetation, and soil properties. While digital infrared thermometers have been employed in a few comparisons, most of the focus of the effectiveness of OTC warming has been on air or soil temperature rather than tissue or surface temperatures, which directly translate to metabolism. Here we used thermal infrared (TIR) photography to quantify tissue and surface temperatures and their spatial variability at a previously unavailable resolution (3-6 mm(2)). We analyzed plots at three locations that are part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX)-Arctic Observing Network (AON-ITEX) network along both moisture and latitudinal gradients spanning from the High Arctic (Barrow, AK, USA) to the Low Arctic (Toolik Lake, AK, USA). Our results show a range of OTC surface warming from 2.65 to 1.27 degrees C (31%-10%) at our three sites. The magnitude of surface warming detected by TIR imagery in this study was comparable to increases in air temperatures previously reported for these sites. However, the thermal images revealed wide ranges of surface temperatures within the OTCs, with some surfaces well above ambient unevenly distributed within the plots under sunny conditions. We note that analyzing radiometric temperature may be an alternative for future studies that examine data acquired at the same time of day from sites that are in close geographic proximity to avoid the requirement of emissivity or atmospheric correction for validation of results. We foresee future studies using TIR photography to describe species-level thermodynamics that could prove highly valuable toward a better understanding of species-specific responses to climate change in the Arctic.

In this paper we present new pollen data and other proxies (lithology, grain size, loss-on-ignition (LOIorg at 550 degrees C)) obtained from a sediment core (BLK11A) from Balikun Lake, north-west China, to explore the vegetation and climate history of 60.4-27.3 ka (1 ka = 1000 calendar years before AD 1950), covering Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Our three main results are: 1) a high relative abundance of thermophilous temperate tree pollen (e.g. Betula) accompanied by other warm-wet associated species (e.g. Ranunculaceae, Cyperaceae, Typha) suggesting warm and wet climate conditions during most of the early MIS3 (59.0-51.7 ka) that resemble the "Holocene optimum" with an increase in effective moisture in most parts of arid western China. Watershed bioproductivity was high as represented by the high LOIorg value. A high abundance of Ephedra pollen was assumed to be caused by frequent shifts in lake level, with locally favourable habitats (dry lake beds) forming when lake area shrank. In addition, an interval with deteriorated climate and vegetation was found between 57 and 56 ka, with a sharp decrease of vegetation cover and bio-productivity. 2) The middle to late MIS3 (51.7-27.3 ka) was marked by the development of desert shrubs (e.g. Rhamnaceae, Nitraria, Zygophyllum), together with low pollen concentrations of upland communities, indicating a continuous and gradually cooling and drying climate that resulted in reduced vegetation cover. Deterioration of the climate is also suggested by the presence of halite deposits and a sustained decrease in watershed bio-productivity. 3) The regional vegetation around Balikun was mainly dominated by Artemisia and Amaranthaceae, which are typical desert-steppe and/or desert taxa, indicating a progressive aridification in north-western China in the late Quaternary. Our new interpretations contradict earlier inferences of highest lake level and wettest conditions prevailing during the late MIS3, and we propose that the decline of northern high-latitude summer insolation and the increase of global ice volume from early to late MIS3 have exerted a remarkable influence on the evolution of vegetation communities and lake level in arid western China on orbital or sub-orbital time scales.

J	Tomaszek, JA; Gardner, WS; Johengen, TH				Tomaszek, JA; Gardner, WS; Johengen, TH			Denitrification in sediments of a Lake Erie coastal wetland (Old Woman Creek, Huron, Ohio, USA)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Denitrification in Old Woman Creek estuary (Lake Erie) sediments was measured by an in vitro N-2-flux method with intact cores and by an in situ chamber method. In both methods, nitrogen gas, the end product of denitrification, was measured directly by gas chromatography. The in situ approach allowed measurement of denitrification directly over short time intervals but its use was limited to shallow depths. Denitrification rates measured with in situ chambers agreed well with those from in vitro intact cores where temperatures in the estuary remained constant. However the two methods could not be accurately compared during the spring where temperature increased rapidly because of the 4-day pre-incubation time needed for sparging for the in vitro method. In vitro denitrification rates ranged from ca 40 to 135 mu mole N-2 m(-2) h(-1) in October 1993 and from 66 to 428 mu mole N-2 m(-2) h(-1) in May and July, 1994. Oxygen consumption rates in these experiments ranged from 0.71 to 3.0 mmole O-2 m(-2) h(-1). Denitrification rates tended to decrease among the flow axis but differences among stations were usually, not significant In situ N-2 accumulation rates ranged from 45 mu mole N(2)m(-2) h(-1) in dark chambers during October 1993 up to apparent values of 2,100 mu mole N-2 m(-2) h(-1) in May 1994, immediately after the water temperature had rapidly increased to 27 degrees C, These calculated values included gas-solubility corrections due to the water-temperature increases. In situ measurements of denitrification rates in transparent chambers were 76-79% higher than rates measured in a similar dark chamber. The results suggest that denitrification is an important sink for-nitrogen in Old Woman Creek estuary and that environmental conditions such as temperature, light, and available substrate affect denitrification rates.																			0380-1330						1997	23	4					403	415		10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70922-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(97)70922-5													WOS:000071611900003

River and landslide dynamics on the western Tanganyika rift border, Uvira, DR Congo: diachronic observations and a GIS inventory of traces of extreme geomorphologic activity	NATURAL HAZARDS												Uvira occupies a series of narrow alluvial fans squeezed between the NW corner of Lake Tanganyika (+/- 710 m asl) and the W-shoulder of the Tanganyika rift, the Itombwe-Mitumba Plateau (+/- 3,000 m asl). In 50 years, the fans progressed into the lake over distances up to some hundreds of metres. This happened during a few catastrophic flash floods issued from the torrents which cascade from the rift shoulder with a mean longitudinal gradient of 0.2 m m(-1). The last event in 2002 led to the destruction of parts of the town and to some 50 casualties. Landslides occurred in the hills. On the base of stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs from 1959, complemented with data from 2000 ETM and 2004 IKONOS imagery, a geographical inventory has been made of strongly incising (10(-1 to 0) m in 43-45 years) river sections, of all types of landslides and of all tectonic structures, visible in the rugged hinterland of the fans. Traces of active N-S as well as E-W trending faults are present. Some of these faults and some surfaces, interpreted as degraded fault facets dip at angles of 40A degrees or less and are probably remnants of formerly active lystric extension faults, originally at a depth of some 2 km, but now at the surface as a result of posterior uplift and erosion. Sixty landslides could be identified. Six slides fall far below the topographic threshold envelope, where the slope at the incision head is expressed as a function of drained surface. Therefore, they are considered to be seismic in origin. Most of the other landslides are located along strongly incising river sections. Temporary landslide barriers contribute to irregular river hydrographs. It is concluded that Uvira is threatened by landsliding, potentially massive (> 18 x 10(6) m(3) debris), in the case of heavy seismicity. It is further discussed that the regularisation of the river regime depends on soil and water conservation strategies, to be developed in the headwaters of the torrents Kavimvira, Mulongwe and Kalimabenge.

Food habits of Yellow Perch, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pikeminnow in Lake Cascade, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Yellow Perch Perca flavescens was first encountered in Lake Cascade, Idaho, in 1957. Since its introduction, the abundance of Yellow Perch in Lake Cascade has been highly variable. Historically, declines in Yellow Perch abundance were attributed to predation by Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis. In the 1990s, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu became established in Lake Cascade. Although Yellow Perch abundance has been high and currently supports a world-class fishery, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has documented poor Yellow Perch recruitment in recent years, concerning regional managers. An investigation into the food habits of Yellow Perch, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pikeminnow was conducted to better understand the importance of juvenile Yellow Perch to predator diets.Methods In Lake Cascade, gill nets were deployed monthly from April 2022 to May 2023. Ageing structures and stomach contents were removed from Yellow Perch, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pikeminnow. Diet composition was quantified and then summarized by species, cohort, and season. Bioenergetics modeling, coupled with estimates of predator abundance, was used to evaluate overall consumption of Yellow Perch.Results In total, stomach contents were extracted from 1,099 Yellow Perch, 440 Smallmouth Bass, and 980 Northern Pikeminnow. Food habits varied by season and predator length, but Yellow Perch was a primary prey item of all study species. The energetic contribution of Yellow Perch to Yellow Perch varied from 10% to 80% across seasons. Smallmouth Bass consumed fewer Yellow Perch than either Yellow Perch or Northern Pikeminnow. The highest average per capita consumption of Yellow Perch (i.e., across seasons) was observed for 500-600-mm Northern Pikeminnow (five Yellow Perch/Northern Pikeminnow). Energetic contribution of Yellow Perch to Northern Pikeminnow diets was highest in spring 2023, yet Northern Pikeminnow consumed the highest average number of Yellow Perch in July. Bioenergetics modeling estimated that per-capita annual consumption of Yellow Perch was 6.0 kg for Yellow Perch, 3.4 kg for Smallmouth Bass, and 9.9 kg for Northern Pikeminnow. In total, estimated consumption of all study species was as high as 37% of the estimated total number age-0 Yellow Perch produced.Conclusions Yellow Perch was an important prey item for all three species, particularly Yellow Perch and Northern Pikeminnow. Results from this study provide important information on the predation of Yellow Perch in Lake Cascade. Further, this work will bolster a growing body of research on the food habits of and interactions between native and nonnative predators in western reservoir systems. A diet analysis was conducted to estimate the consumption of Yellow Perch by three predator species in Lake Cascade, Idaho. The results indicated that Yellow Perch and Northern Pikeminnow consumed the greatest quantity of Yellow Perch and may contribute to variable Yellow Perch recruitment.

Because of the large number of species, their wide distributions and varying degrees of impact, we need a more effective method for prioritizing control strategies for cost-effective investment across heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we develop a prioritization framework that synthesizes scientific data, elicits knowledge from experts and stakeholders to identify control strategies, and appraises the cost-effectiveness of strategies. Our objective was to identify the most cost-effective strategies for reducing the total area dominated by high-impact non-native plants in the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB). We use a case study of the 120million ha Lake Eyre Basin that comprises some of the most distinctive Australian landscapes, including Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. More than 240 non-native plant species are recorded in the Lake Eyre Basin, with many predicted to spread, but there are insufficient resources to control all species. Lake Eyre Basin experts identified 12 strategies to control, contain or eradicate non-native species over the next 50years. The total cost of the proposed Lake Eyre Basin strategies was estimated at AU$17billion, an average of AU$34million annually. Implementation of these strategies is estimated to reduce non-native plant dominance by 17million ha - there would be a 32% reduction in the likely area dominated by non-native plants within 50years if these strategies were implemented. The three most cost-effective strategies were controlling Parkinsonia aculeata, Ziziphus mauritiana and Prosopis spp. These three strategies combined were estimated to cost only 001% of total cost of all the strategies, but would provide 20% of the total benefits. Over 50years, cost-effective spending of AU$23million could eradicate all non-native plant species from the only threatened ecological community within the Lake Eyre Basin, the Great Artesian Basin discharge springs.Synthesis and applications. Our framework, based on a case study of the 120 million ha Lake Eyre Basin in Australia, provides a rationale for financially efficient investment in non-native plant management and reveals combinations of strategies that are optimal for different budgets. It also highlights knowledge gaps and incidental findings that could improve effective management of non-native plants, for example addressing the reliability of species distribution data and prevalence of information sharing across states and regions.

J	Lund, M; Shearn-Bochsler, V; Dusek, RJ; Shivers, J; Hofmeister, E				Lund, Melissa; Shearn-Bochsler, Valerie; Dusek, Robert J.; Shivers, Jan; Hofmeister, Erik			Potential for Waterborne and Invertebrate Transmission of West Nile Virus in the Great Salt Lake, Utah	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In November and December of 2013, a large mortality event involving 15,000 to 20,000 eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) occurred at the Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT. The onset of the outbreak in grebes was followed by a mortality event in >86 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). During the die-off, West Nile virus (WNV) was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or viral culture in the carcasses of grebes and eagles submitted to the National Wildlife Health Center. However, no activity of mosquitoes, the primary vectors of WNV, was detected by the State of Utah's WNV monitoring program. The transmission of WNV has rarely been reported during the winter in North America in the absence of known mosquito activity; however, the size of this die-off, the habitat in which it occurred, and the species involved are unique. We experimentally investigated whether WNV could survive in water with a high salt content, as found at the GSL, and whether brine shrimp, the primary food of migrating eared grebes on the GSL, could have played a role in the transmission of WNV to feeding birds. We found that WNV can survive up to 72 h at 4 degrees C in water containing 30 to 150 ppt NaCl, and brine shrimp incubated with WNV in 30 ppt NaCl may adsorb WNV to their cuticle and, through feeding, infect epithelial cells of their gut. Both mechanisms may have potentiated the WNV die-off in migrating eared grebes on the GSL. IMPORTANCE Following a major West Nile virus die-off of eared grebes and bald eagles at the Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT, in November to December 2013, this study assessed the survival of West Nile virus (WNV) in water as saline as that of the GSL and whether brine shrimp, the major food for migrating grebes, could have played a role as a vector for the virus. While mosquitoes are the major vector of WNV, under certain circumstances, transmission may occur through contaminated water and invertebrates as food.

This may pose a risk to benthic and epibenthic organisms and it is crucial that toxicity tests that are available for environmental risk assessment can identify potentially adverse effects of sediment-associated substances on benthic organisms, such as harpacticoid copepods. While marine harpacticoids have been protected via a number of acute and chronic sediment tests, the freshwater harpacticoid copepod community has so far been neglected in such activities. The main aim of the present study was therefore to (a) find a suitable freshwater harpacticoid copepod, (b) establish robust laboratory mass cultures and (c) develop a chronic test for assessment of sediment-associated toxicity using spiked sediments. After several cultivation trials with a number of potential test species, the choice fell on the benthic freshwater harpacticoid copepod Attheyella crassa, a species that possesses many of the characteristic features identified as prerequisites for toxicity test organisms, e.g. it has a sexual reproduction, it is relatively easy to grow and keep in mass cultures in the laboratory, and it has a small body size. Owing to the relatively long generation time of freshwater harpacticoids (in relation to many marine harpacticoids), it was decided that the test should be separated into a development part (21 days) and a reproduction part (14 days) running in parallel. As a reference substance we used the fungicide tebuconazole, which is currently subject to risk assessment and which partitions to soil and sediment. Clear concentration-related responses were observed for all endpoints analyzed. Nauplia body length was the most sensitive endpoint with a measured time weighted LOECwater of 20 mu g/L. The corresponding LOECwater for larval mortality and offspring production was 65 and 62 mu g/L, respectively. In conclusion, A. crassa is an ecologically relevant test species for freshwater ecosystems and particularly for the cold, oligotrophic and often acidic lakes of Northern Europe. Regardless of the relatively long generation time of this species, our results clearly show that sediment-associated toxicity related to development and sexual reproduction can be assessed within 2-3 weeks exposure with the developed bioassay.

J	Novak, B; Björck, S				Novak, B; Björck, S			Late Pleistocene-early Holocene fluvial facies and depositional processes in the Fehmarn Belt, between Germany and Denmark, revealed by high-resolution seismic and lithofacies analysis	SEDIMENTOLOGY												In the narrow offshore border zone between Germany and Denmark, 550 km of high-density 3.5-kHz subbottom seismic reflection profiles were recorded within a 70-km(2) area in order to reconstruct the seismic stratigraphy of late Pleistocene to early Holocene lacustrine and fluvial environments. Using detailed line drawings, seismic facies analyses and a hierarchy of bounding surfaces, a depositional unit was recognized and subdivided into subunits 4(a) (oblique-parallel), 4(b) (mound, oblique-tangential), 4(c) (sigmoid, oblique), 4(d) and 4(e) (shingled and parallel). The base of this seismic facies association defines a wide U-shaped valley with well-defined scours and, in the valley sides, steps are located above deep steep-dipping reflections. Stratigraphic control was available from 32 coring sites (5- to 12-m-deep vibrocores). Subunit 4(b) represents coarsening-up silt and sand, and samples from subunit 4(d) show fining-up fine sand, silt and clay. The seismic facies association is proposed to have formed by a fluvial event of short duration some time in the period between 10.3 C-14 ka BP and 9.0 C-14 ka BP. Subunits 4(a) to 4(e) represent gradually decreasing flow power. A peak flow initiated the fluvial event, after which water discharge and level fell rapidly. Subsequently, the normal background discharge from the Baltic Sea area dominated the flow style. Reflections beneath the step-like valley side with high dip angles are interpreted as faults. This tectonic activity resulted in subsidence in the analysed area and could possibly have influenced the fluvio-dynamic development. The seismic stratigraphic succession reveals a high-resolution record of sediments in this area. In particular, the stepwise uncovering of the morphology of the subunits, preserved in high-resolution seismic facies associations, is proposed as a useful tool in modelling the dynamic development of the near sea-floor environment.																			0037-0746					JUN	2002	49	3					451	465		10.1046/j.1365-3091.2002.00454.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2002.00454.x													WOS:000176798700005

In order to estimate the current situation of source and sink of main greenhouse gases in Baiyangdian wetland and evaluate the influences of wetland system to the greenhouse effect of North China, static closed chamber-gas chromatogram method was adopted to study the space-time variation characteristics of N2O, CH4, and CO2 emission fluxes in Baiyangdian wetland. The analysis results indicate: the lake wetland which was abundant in organic matters and nutritive salt was an important greenhouse gases emission source. During one year of observation, it was found out that the fluxes of N2O, CH4, and CO2 of Baiyangdian wetland posses a very high time variability, with the range of variation being -0.08 similar to 0.33 mg.m(-2).h(-1), -5.40 similar to 328.65 mg.m(2).h(-1) and -814.06 similar to 2934.93 mg.m(-2).h(-1). The emission fluxes of N2O, CH4, and CO2 reaches to maximum in summer, respectively being 62.09%, 92.15% and 87.04% of the annual total emission flux; The lakeside was a core area of N2O, CH4 emission, with annual average emission flux respectively reaching up to 0.11 mg.m(-2).h(-1) and 40.86 mg.m(2).h(-1). Although the main emission area of CO2 was land, the emission flux of lakeside, with annual average emission flux being 692.35 mg.m(-2).h(-1), was also very high, ranking only second to land; the lakeside area of Baiyangdian wetland was only 12.60% of the whole lake wetland area, but the emission loads of N2O, CH4, and CO2 were respectively 26.51%, 43.96% and 23.76% of the total emission load, which explains that the lakeside was leading the greenhouse gases emission of Baiyangdian wetland.																					978-0-7695-4923-1; 978-1-4673-4893-5				2013							1120	1124		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2012.264													WOS:000319283600258
J	Rorslett, B; Johansen, SW				Rorslett, B; Johansen, SW			Remedial measures connected with aquatic macrophytes in Norwegian regulated rivers and reservoirs	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT					International Workshop on Remedial Strategies in Regulated Rivers	SEP 25-28, 1995	LYCKSELE, SWEDEN	Swedish Environmental Protect Agcy				Enhanced growth of aquatic macrophytes have been recorded from some Norwegian rivers regulated for generating hydropower, and reducing the aquatic vegetation to manageable levels is desirable. Weir building is a common practice on Norwegian low flow reaches, but this in turn can result in silting and nuisance growth of macrophytes. Using herbicides to treat aquatic systems is not allowed by the Norwegian environmental authorities and alternative methods of macrophyte control have to be employed. In contrast, many regulated rivers and reservoirs are devoid of macrophytes and the management aim then is to restore native aquatic vegetation. Mechanical methods using harvesters and cutting devices are often difficult to implement in running water. Better results have been achieved utilizing flushing flows to scour sediments and associated macrophytes. Using a sharply peaking flow gives a more efficient control of excessive macrophyte growth because only the initial surge actively scours the river bed. Moss quantities flushed out in a number of controlled flows exhibited a strong log-linear relationship to significant how, Q*, in River Suldalslagen, south-western Norway. Temporarily halting hydroelectric facilities during cold spells to drain the river and thereby expose submerged macrophytes to frost, has been applied to the River Otra in southern Norway. An attendant ice run resulted in heavy loss of macrophytes in this river. The benefit of winter draw-downs combined with flushing flow is partly offset by downstream accumulation of the removed plants. The potential to revegetate shores of reservoirs and impoundments has been studied in Meltingen, a regulated lake in mid-Norway. This field study indicates that amending the shore substrate by light dressing with fertilizer results in enhanced survival of amphibious species. This study also demonstrates the need for sediment seed banks or nearby sanctuaries from which aquatic species can extend into the reservoir during years with a favourable high water level. Reducing the designated fluctuation range of reservoir elevation from 7 to 1.6 m resulted in recolonization by submerged macrophytes in Hartevatn, a reservoir on the upper River Otra.																			0886-9375					JUL-OCT	1996	12	4-5					509	522																WOS:A1996VK75500014

Methodological standpoints concerning the limestone dissolution rate, acidic surges and reacidification are also discussed. L Alinenjarvi (0.45 km(2)) is located near the city of Nokia with a surrounding population of over 5 000 (< 2 km). Before liming,the lake had only a sparse crayfish (Astacus astacus L) population left, because reproduction had been failing since the early 1980s. The most important effect of liming is that it should connect with the potential production of crayfish. The roach (Rutilus rutilus L) population was also affected The liming improved the chemical quality of the water, and decreased also the Al and Mn concentrations. The number of phytoplankton species increased, and the species composition of periphyton changed after liming. The a-chlorophyll concentration in water remained low. Furthermore, crustacean zooplankton and benthic animals increased in abundance in the first late summer after liming. ?he diet analysis of perch (Perca fluviatilis L) gave comparable results suggesting a possible positive effect of liming on their food resources. The improved water quality seems to make the reproduction of the crayfish possible again, but recovery would take several years. To guarantee a recovery, the introduction of new crayfish individuals and supplementary neutralizing methods would be needed. The results of a mailed survey showed that L Alinenjarvi is a valuable water source for the local people. The most usual forms of leisure around the lake and shores are, however, outdoor recreation and swimming, with only minor usage for fishing. Despite that, though the immediate benefits would be negligible, a majority of local residents supported the continuation of liming even though they would have to carry the costs in the future.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					937	942		10.1007/BF00476950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476950													WOS:A1995UB05300108

Groundwater potential assessment and delineation in a highly heterogeneous environment with limited Spatiotemporal data derived from Gelana watershed of Abaya Chamo lake basin is performed, using integrated multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), water and energy transfer between soil and plant and atmosphere under quasi-steady state (WetSpass) models. The outputs of the WetSpass model reveal a favorable structure of water balance in the basin studied, mainly using surface runoff. The simulated total flow and groundwater recharge are validated using river measurements and estimated baseflow at two gauging stations located in the study area, which yields a good agreement. The WetSpass model effectively integrates a water balance assessment in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. The WetSpass model is shown to be computationally reputable for such a remote complex setting as the African rift, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and 0.99 for total flow and baseflow at a significant level of p-value<0.05, respectively. The simulated annual water budget reveals that 77.22% of annual precipitation loses through evapotranspiration, of which 16.54% is lost via surface runoff while 6.24% is recharged to the groundwater. The calibrated groundwater recharge from the WetSpass model is then considered when determining the controlling factors of groundwater occurrence and formation, together with other multi-thematic layers such as lithology, geomorphology, lineament density and drainage density. The selected five thematic layers through MCDA are incorporated by employing the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method to identify the relative dominance in groundwater potential zoning. The weighted factors in the AHP are procedurally aggregated, based on weighted linear combinations to provide the groundwater potential index. Based on the potential indexes, the area then is demarcated into low, moderate, and high groundwater potential zones (GWPZ). The identified GWPZs are finally examined using the existing groundwater inventory data (static water level and springs) in the region. About 70.7% of groundwater inventory points are coinciding with the delineated GWPZs. The weighting comparison shows that lithology, geomorphology, and groundwater recharge appear to be the dominant factors influence on the resources potential. The assessment of groundwater potential index values identify 45.88% as high, 39.38% moderate, and 14.73% as low groundwater potential zones. WetSpass model analysis is more preferable in the area like Gelana watershed when the topography is rugged, inaccessible and having limited gauging stations.

For purposes of reproduction, salmonids generally behaviorally respond to the currents of streams and lakes in recently glaciated areas. For feeding and maturation, many larger species migrate into existing systems of large lakes, seas, and oceans. The subfamilies include Salmoninae, Coregoninae, and Thymallinae. In many locales and regions of the hemisphere, numerous species of these subfamilies evolved and self-organized into species flocks or taxocenes of bewildering complexity. For example, any individual species may play different or unique ecological roles in different taxocenes. The northern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean ecosystems, with their seas and tributaries, each contained a meta-complex of such taxocenes that, in their natural state some centuries ago, resembled each other but differed in many ways. Humans have valued all species of this family for subsistence, ceremonial, naturalist, gustatory, angling, and commercial reasons for centuries. Modern progressive humans (MPHs), whose industrial and commercial enterprises have gradually spread over this hemisphere in recent time, now affect aquatic ecosystems at all scales from local to global. These human effects mingle in complex ways that together induce uniquely natural salmonid taxocenes to disintegrate with the loss of species, including those groups least tolerant to human manipulations, but extending more recently to those taxa. more adapted to anthropogenic change. As we leave the modern era, dominated by MPHs, will we find ways to live sustainably with salmonid taxocenes that still exhibit self-organizational integrity, or will only individual, isolated populations of salmonid species, derived from those most tolerant of MPHs, survive? To achieve future sustainability of salmonids, we suggest implementation of a search for intuitive knowledge based on faith in the wisdom of nature and a caring-sharing, behavioral structure based on "survival of the wisest" for both humans and salmonids.																			0892-2284		1-888569-65-4				2004	43						203	211																WOS:000227011900011

Because fossil Dipodomys thus will be known mostly from isolated teeth, cheekteeth of five species were studied in detail. The extinct Prodipodomys differs from Dipodomys in having brachydont teeth with strong roots that lack dentine tracts. The same characters may vary specifically in Dipodomys but appear to be of limited utility. The cusps, lophs, and valleys exposed at the tops of newly erupted teeth of Dipodomys form the enamel cap and pattern. Differences in enamel cap pattern of LP4 are of little value in differentiating species of Dipodomys and those of the molars are of limited utility. The enamel cap pattern of UP4 is swiftly worm away after exposure but will separate some species. Dipodomys elator has the central valley extending completely across the unworm UP4 and the protoloph possesses a large paracone. D. compactus has a bifurcated central valley confined to the lingual side of the tooth. D. ordii and D. spectabilis have the central valley deep and pitlike, forming isolated lakes with slight wear, and the metacone forms a nipple-shaped labial corner to the tooth. D. merriami has the central valley expanded to a shallow cup, protoloph reduced to an enamel wall, and nipple-shaped lingual and labial corners. In the enamel cap pattern of Dipodomys the protoloph is united with wear to the metaloph by the metacone along the labial margin of the tooth. In Prodipodomys centralis, the protoloph is united to the hypocone of the central axis of the tooth. Dipodomys probably is not descendent from Prodipodomys centralis. Extinct species of Dipodomys include D. minor (early Irvingtonian age), D. hibbardi (latest Blancan age) and a new species [D. pattersoni], described beyond, of Irvingtonian age. Dipodomys fossils of later Pleistocene age have been referred to extant species.																			0040-4403					AUG	1986	38	3					251	263																WOS:A1986D506700005
J	Wang, EC; Meng, QR				Wang ErChie; Meng QingRen			Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Longmenshan fault belt	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												The giant earthquake (M (s)=8.0) in Wenchuan on May 12, 2008 was triggered by oblique convergence between the Tibetan Plateau and the South China along the Longmenshan fault belt. The Longmenshan fault belt marks an important component of the tectonic and geomorphological boundary between the eastern and western part of China and has a protracted tectonic history. It was first formed as an intracontinental transfer fault, patitioning the differential deformation between the Pacific and Tethys tectonic domains, initiated in late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic time, then served as the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau to accommodate the growth of the plateau in Cenozoic. Its current geological and geomorphological frameworks are the result of superimposition of these two tectonic events. In Late Triassic, the Longmenshan underwent left-slip oblique NW-SE shortening due to the clockwise rotation of the Yangtze Block, which led to the flexural subsidence of the Sichuan foreland basin, but after that, the subsidence of the Sichuan Basin seems no longer controlled by the tectonic activity of the Longmenshan fault belt. The Meosozoic tectonic evolution of the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt differs significantly compared with that of the Yangtze Platform, featured by intensive northeast and southwest shortening and resulted in the close of the Paleo-Tethys. Aerial photos taken immediately after main shock of the giant May 12, 2008 earthquake have documented extensive rock fall and landslides that represent one of the most destructive aspects of the earthquake. Both rock avalanches and landslides delivered a huge volume of debris into the middle part of the Minjiang River, and formed many dammed lakes. Breaching of these natural dams can be catastrophic, as occurred in the Diexi area along the upstream of the Minjiang River in the year of 1933 that led to devastating floodings. The resultant flood following the breaching of these dams flowed through and out of the Longmenshan belt into the Chengdu Plain, bringing a huge volume of sediments. The oldest alluvial deposits within the Chengdu Plain are estimated to be Late Miocene (8-13 Ma). We suggest that the flooding that transported the course-grained sediments into the Chengdu Plain occurred in late Cenozoic, resulted from both the climate and the historical earthquakes similar to the May 12 earthquake. Estimated age of the sediments related to earthquakes and coeval shortening across the Chengdu Plain indicate that the eastern margin of the plateau became seismically and tectonically active in Late Miocene.

The degradation rate of lake wetlands of the Huitengxile grassland, Inner Mongolia, has increased over recent years. In this study, soil samples were collected in a degraded lake wetland of the Huitengxile grassland. The abundance and composition of soil ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing approaches. Four sampling sites were selected according to the order of water withdrawal. The lakeshore sample appeared to have the highest copy numbers of AOB amoA genes, and the lowest AOB population size was found in the lakebed sample. Similar to AOB, the AOA were most abundant in the lakeshore sample, and the population size in the lake centre sample was the lowest. Ex2cept in one lakebed sample, AOB were more abundant than AOA in all other samples, with AOB to AOA ratios ranging from 11 to 13. Phylogenetic analysis of the amoA gene fragments showed that all AOB sequences from different sites were affiliated to class -Proteobacteria, order Nitrosomonadales, family Nitrosomonadaceae and can be grouped into two clusters. Little difference was found in AOB community composition among different samples, which indicated that AOB community composition was stable during the drying process of the degraded lake. However, the AOA community compositions were very different between samples. All AOA sequences fell into four clusters. Cluster 1 was dominant in the sample from the centre of the lake, and cluster 2 was dominant in the lakeshore sample, indicating a difference in the community composition of AOA in response to the drying up of the lake. No clear relationship was found between the AOA and AOB community populations and soil physio-chemical properties. This study suggested that the AOA community in wetland systems is more sensitive than the AOB community to the drying process of the wetland ecosystem.					li, jing yu/J-1486-2012; Li, Jingyu/J-1486-2012; Wang, Xiaoyi/B-5781-2009	li, jing yu/0000-0003-0906-3422; 													1838-675X	1838-6768					2013	51	6					554	560		10.1071/SR13160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR13160													WOS:000329853700010

Paired together in each dimension of the matrix are versions of the code with and without one of the changes. The three changes involve 1) a sophisticated land surface model [the Parameterization for Land-Atmosphere Convective Exchange (PLACE)], 2) the soil moisture and temperature initial conditions derived from running PLACE offline, and 3) a 1.5- order turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) turbulence boundary layer. The code without changes, defined as the control code, uses the most widely applied land surface, soil initialization, and boundary layer options found in the current MM5 community code. As an initial test of these modifications, a case was chosen in which they should have their greatest effect: conditions where heterogeneous surface forcing dominates over dynamic processes. The case chosen is one with widespread summertime moist convection, during the Convection and Precipitation Electrification Experiment (CaPE) in the middle of the Florida peninsula. Of the eight runs, the code with all three changes (labeled TKE-PLACE) demonstrates the best overall skill in terms of biases of the surface variables, rainfall, and percent and root-mean-square error of cloud cover fraction for this case. An early, isolated convective storm that formed near the east coast, at the downwind edge of a region of anomalous wet soil, and within the dense cluster of CaPE mesoscale observation stations, is correctly simulated only by TKE-PLACE. It does not develop in any of the other seven runs. A factor separation analysis shows that a successful simulation requires the inclusion of the more sophisticated land surface model, realistic initial soil moisture and temperature, and the higher-order closure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in order to better represent the effect of joint and synergistic (nonlinear) contributions from the land surface and PBL on the moist convection.

This ciliate occurs as a parasite in the haemocoel of larval Sialis lutaria (Megaloptera) and exhibits field and laboratory characteristics favourable for two particular areas of study, the regulation of invertebrate populations by parasites and insect immunity to parasitic infections. The prevalence of T. sialidos infection in S. lutaria from a small lake in mid-Wales [UK] has been monitored during a four-year period. Each summer, early in the first of their two-year aquatic development, 40-70% of S. lutaria larvae become infected. Death of infected larvae due to parasite proliferation is inevitable but does not occur until 11-12 months after infection, when the mean intensity has reached 55,000 ciliates per infected host. Ciliates escaping from moribund or dead host larvae undergo a distinct morphological transformation followed by a period of synchronous conjugation. Death of infected host larvae and release of ciliates coincides with the appearance of a new generation of host larvae in which the prevalence of infection rises rapidly. The possible significance of this substantial and persistent regulatory influence upon host population dynamics is discussed in relation to current ideas of parasite regulation of invertebrate populations. Sialis lutaria is not able normally to mount a successful host response against T. sialidos infections. A laboratory thermal-shock technique is described by means of which parasitic ciliates may be killed in situ without incurring physical damage to the host. Infected larvae subjected to thermal-shock at 39.degree. C for 1 h subsequently encapsulate and melanize the dead ciliates. The use of this technique is discussed in relation to recognition of non-self in insects and survival strategies of parasites infecting insects.																			0962-8436	1471-2970					1985	310	1143					123	+		10.1098/rstb.1985.0102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1985.0102													WOS:A1985AQG7700002

Reduced feed consumption was observed in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food. beginning on day 45 of exposure. The accumulation and distribution of As in these fish are described in the previous manuscript [Pedlar, R.M., Klaverkamp, J.F., 2001. The accumulation and distribution of dietary arsenic in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). Aquat. Toxicol_ in press]. At the molecular level of organization, metallothionein (MT) induction occurred in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food after 10 and 30 days, and in fish fed the 1 and 10 mug As/g diets for 64 days. Dietary As exposure did not have a significant effect on plasma lipid peroxide (LPO) concentrations. At the tissue and organ level, mean liver somatic index decreased significantly in lake whitefish fed the 100 mug As/g food for 64 days. Blood parameters (hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) were not affected by exposure to As contaminated diets. Liver and gallbladder histopathologies were observed in lake whitefish fed all As contaminated diets after each duration of exposure. Histopathology observed in liver included nuclear, architectural and structural alterations, areas of inflammation, and focal necrosis. Sloughing of the epithelium, dilation of vascular elements, inflammation, edema, fibrosis, and increased width of the submucosa were some of the alterations observed in gallbladders of lake whitefish fed As contaminated diets. Both organs were sensitive to As exposure, as damage occurred with exposure to dietary concentrations of As as low as 1 mug/g. Whole organism parameters were unaltered by dietary As exposure. Based on the results of this study, histopathological alterations in liver and gallbladder, and hepatic MT induction may be useful indicators of As toxicity in environmental monitoring programs that also measure As concentrations in those tissues.

J	Szeicz, JM; MacDonald, GM				Szeicz, JM; MacDonald, GM			Montane climate and vegetation dynamics in easternmost Beringia during the Late Quaternary	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Beringian Paleoenvironments Workshop	1997	BERINGIA, RUSSIA					New and published palynological data are used to investigate the Quaternary vegetation history of high-elevation sites in the Mackenzie Mountains of easternmost Beringia (Northwest Territories, Canada). During some previous interglacials, sites that are presently treeless supported spruce forest, indicating conditions were warmer than present and possibly warmer than at any time in the Holocene. No information is available on vegetation in unglaciated portions of the Mountains during the Last Glacial Maximum, but in the Lateglacial (ca 12,000-10,000 C-14 yr BP), a shrub- and herb-dominated vegetation, characterized in the pollen record by Artemisia, Betula, Salix, gramnoids and herbs, grew at all elevations: and extended in a continuous corridor southwards to Alberta. Populus balsamifera probably grew up to and above present treeline between about 11,000 and 9000 yr BP. The late Pleistocene vegetation of the Mackenzie Mountains contrasts with the rest of eastern and central Beringia, which supported a Betula-dominated shrub tundra by 12,000 yr BP. Betula shrub tundra expanded at all elevations in the mountains by 10,000 yr BP, followed by the expansion of Picea glauca and Picea mariana forest at ca 8000 yr BP. There is evidence for limited elevational shifts in treeline during the Holocene. Picea population densities in the forest-tundra were probably greater than at present in the early and mid-Holocene. Vegetation changes in the Mackenzie Mountains during this time are consistent with increased summer insolation and temperatures during the early to mid-Holocene. Higher resolution analysis (decadal to century scale) of small lake basins at treeline in this region also provide evidence for a late Holocene increase in forest-tundra density and/or a treeline rise centered on 3000 yr BP. Slight warming at this time has been noted at sites in the southern Rocky Mountains, and provides evidence for century-scale climatic fluctuations superimposed on the longer-term changes resulting from variations in insolation.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Proxy evidence at decadal resolution from Late Holocene sediments from Pickerel Lake, northeastern South Dakota, shows distinct centennial cycles (400-700 years) in magnetic susceptibility: contents of carbonate, organic carbon, and major elements: abundance in ostracodes: and delta O-18 and delta C-13 values in calcite. Proxies indicate cyclic changes in eolian input, productivity, and temperature. Maxima in magnetic susceptibility are accompanied by maxima in aluminum and iron mass accumulation rates (MARS), and in abundances of the ostracode Fabaeformiscandona rawsoni. This indicates variable windy, and dry conditions with westerly wind dominance, including during the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Maxima in carbonates, organic carbon, phosphorous, and high delta C-13 values of endogenic calcite indicate moister and less windy periods with increased lake productivity, including during the Little Ice Age, and alternate with maxima of eolian transport. Times of the Maunder, Sparer and Wolf sunspot minima are characterized by maxima in delta O-18 values and aluminum MARs, and minima in delta C-13 values and organic carbon content. We interpret these lake conditions during sunspot minima to indicate decreases in lake surface water temperatures of up to 4-5 degrees C associated with decreases in epilimnetic productivity during summer. We propose that the centennial cycles are triggered by solar activity, originate in the tropical Pacific, and their onset during the Late Holocene is associated with insolation conditions driven by precession. The cyclic pattern is transmitted from the tropical Pacific into the atmosphere and transported by westerly winds into the North Atlantic realm where they strengthen the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation during periods of northern Great Plains wind maxima. This consequently leads to moister climates in Central and Northern Europe. Thus, Pickerel Lake provides evidence for mechanisms of teleconnections including an atmospheric link bridging between the different climate regimes from the tropical Pacific to the North Atlantic and onto the European continent.

A chronicle of Miocene extension near the Colorado Plateau-Basin and Range boundary, southern White Hills, northwestern Arizona: Paleogeographic and tectonic implications	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											In northwestern Arizona, the high-standing, relatively unextended Colorado Plateau abruptly gives way across a system of major west-dipping normal faults to a highly extended part of the Basin and Range province known as the northern Colorado River extensional corridor. The transition from unextended to highly extended upper crust is unusually sharp within this region, contrasting with a broad transition zone elsewhere. The southern White Hills lie near the eastern margin of the extensional corridor in northwestern Arizona and contain a large east-tilted half graben that chronicles Miocene extension and constrains the timing of structural demarcation between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range province during Neogene time. This growth-fault basin is bounded on the east by the west-dipping Cyclopic and Cerbat Mountains fault zones. Greater tilts in the hanging walls suggest that these faults have listric geometries. The stratigraphy in the half graben consists of Miocene volcanic rocks intercalated with an eastward-thickening wedge of synextensional fanglomerates. Tilts in the Miocene units decrease up section from similar to 75 degrees to 5 degrees. Recent 40Ar/39Ar dating (11 new dates) of variably tilted volcanic rocks in the growth-fault basin and regional relations constrain the timing of east-west extension between ca. 16.6 and <9 Ma, with peak extension from ca. 16.6 to 15.2 Ma. Capping 8.7 Ma basalts are tilted 5 degrees-10 degrees and record the waning stages of extension. Thus, the sharp boundary between the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range began developing by ca. 16.5 Ma and has changed little since ca. 9 Ma. Major extension and basin development significantly lowered base level within the extensional corridor and induced headward erosion into the western margin of the Colorado Plateau, which ultimately facilitated development of the western Grand Canyon. Abundant clasts of 1.7 Ga megacrystic granite in the eastward-thickening fanglomerates within the growth-fault basin suggest a partial provenance from the Garnet Mountain area along or near the western margin of the Colorado Plateau beginning as early as ca. 16 Ma and continuing to ca. 9 Ma.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2463-8				2010	463						87	119		10.1130/2010.2463(05)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2463(05)													WOS:000286214300005
J	KEEFE, PD; MOORE, KG				KEEFE, PD; MOORE, KG			FREEZING TOLERANCE IN HYDRATED LACTUCA-SATIVA (L) SEED - A MODEL TO EXPLAIN OBSERVED VARIATION BETWEEN SEED LOTS	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Low temperature tolerance was investigated in the imbibed seed of 15 seed lots comprising 7 cultivars [Great Lakes, Webbs Wonderful, Winter Density, Lobjoits Green Cos, Salad Bowl, All the year round and Tom Thumb]of L. sativa L. During rapid cooling (20.degree. C h-1), some seeds of all seed lots survived to -16.degree. C, but none to -20.degree. C. The majority of seed lots retained > 50% viability above -14.degree. C due to isolation of the embryo from external ice by the endosperm and subsequent embryo super-cooling. Certain seed lots, including all 3 seed lots of cv. Tom Thumb, showed high mortality at temperatures > -10.degree. C. Correlation of mortality with the formation of external ice suggested that the endosperm is not an effective nucleation barrier in these seed lots. Survival to -20.degree. C was increased at slower cooling rates (6 to 1.degree. C h-1) due to freeze desiccation of the embryo, but seed lots varied considerably in their tolerance of specific cooling rates. A model to explain this variation was developed incorporating (1) seed lots super-cooling limit temperature, (2) the rate at which freeze dehydration of the supercooled embryo took place, (3) the moisture content at which nucleation (at -20.degree. C) was no longer certain and (4) the initial equilibrium moisture content of the fully imbibed seed. Factors (1), (2) and (3) were relatively constant, but low (or artificially reduced) seed moisture content was closely correlated with high survival at natural cooling rates. Seed size fractions of similar content from a single cultivar showed that more small seeds survive cooling at 3.degree. C h-1 to -20.degree. C than larger seed. Seed with pierced endosperms or ineffective nucleation barriers were capable of surviving to at least -10.degree. C if cooled slowly (1.degree. C h-1) but were killed by rapid (20.degree.

J	Hobson, KA; Sirois, J; Gloutney, ML				Hobson, KA; Sirois, J; Gloutney, ML			Tracing nutrient allocation to reproduction with stable isotopes: A preliminary investigation using colonial waterbirds of Great Slave Lake	AUK												We investigated the use of stable-isotope analysis as a direct means of tracing allocation of endogenous protein and lipid reserves to reproduction in five gulls (Larus canus, L. delawarensis, L. californicus, L. argentatus, L. philadelphia), four terns (Sterna caspia, S. hirundo, S. paradisaea, Chlidonias niger), and one jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) breeding on Great Slave Lake (GSL) in the Northwest Territories. Our approach was based on assumptions that (1) body tissues of birds just arriving at GSL from their assumed marine-associated wintering habitats would have stable-isotope ratios more enriched than those of birds in equilibrium with the local GSL foodweb, and (2) mobilization of these reserves to reproduction could be traced by the isotopic measurement of egg macronutrients. As predicted, the pectoral muscle of six species of arriving birds was more enriched in C-13 ((x) over bar = -21.5 parts per thousand) and N-15 ((x) over bar = 12.7 parts per thousand) than was that of postbreeding birds (C-13, (x) over bar = -23.5 parts per thousand; N-15, (x) over bar = 9.9 parts per thousand) or hatching-year birds raised at GSL (C-13, (x) over bar = -24.3 parts per thousand; N-15, (x) over bar = 9.0 parts per thousand). Abdominal fat of arriving Herring Gulls and Mew Gulls was more enriched in C-13 ((x) over bar = -19.7 parts per thousand) than the fat of other species ((x) over bar = -23.4 parts per thousand), indicating lipids of marine origin. We compared isotope values of the local GSL foodweb with dietary values predicted from isotope measurements of egg macronutrients ii diets were entirely derived at GSL. Isotopic analysis of lipid-free egg yolk, yolk lipid, and shell carbonate suggested that for most species, little if any endogenous protein reserves were used for reproduction, with the possible exception of Caspian Terns, whose egg protein and egg lipid values, and Common Terns, whose egg protein values, were more enriched in C-13 than those of the other species. Although endogenous nutrient reserves likely were important to birds during migration and the initial settling period at GSL, local food supplies were adequate to provide nutrients for reproduction.

J	Yang, XP; Rost, KT; Lehmkuhl, F; Zhenda, Z; Dodson, J				Yang, XP; Rost, KT; Lehmkuhl, F; Zhenda, Z; Dodson, J			The evolution of dry lands in northern China and in the Republic of Mongolia since the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The dry lands ill China and Mongolia include sand seas, gravel deserts, stable sand dunes, desert steppe, steppe and scrubwoodlands environments distributed in a wide range of geomorphological and tectonic settings, front 155 m below sea level to more than 5000 m asl. In China, the sandy deserts and gravel deserts are located in the arid regions mainly west of the Helan Mountains (similar to 106degreesE), whereas the stable dune regions are distributed in the semi-arid areas east of the Helan Mountains. In Mongolia, deserts cover more than 40% of the country. They are mainly distributed in the Southern and southwestern part of the country, in inter-mountain valleys and basins of the Altai Mountains, and in the Uvs Nuur Basin in northwestern Mongolia. The desert regions enclose mainly gravel desert (=Gobi) and comprise some areas with sand fields and dune fields, especially in western Mongolia. Relict frost wedges and moraines in the Chaidamu and Tarim basins of China indicate that the coldest time of the last glaciation Occurred at 30-25 ka in these two areas. The stratigraphy of the dunes in the Badain Jaran Desert, high lake levels in the areas near and within the large deserts in China and in Mongolia Suggest a much more humid climate in western China and in Mongolia during marine isotope stage three. However, the period after 24 ka to the end of the Pleistocene was mostly characterised by increased temperature and reduced precipitation in the Chaidamu and Tarim basins. Paleoenvironmental conditions in the eastern part of the Chinese desert belt were marked by an extensive widening of dune formation at similar to 21-13 ka, reflecting a weaker intensity of East Asian summer monsoon. During the Holocene, higher lake levels, stratigraphy of dunes and results of palynological, isotopical and sedimentological analyses of lacustrine sediments in the western China and Mongolia suggest a few wetter periods, especially in the earlier part of the Holocene. The Holocene climatic conditions in the eastern part of the Chinese deserts have enabled stabilisation of duties and formation of soils. The presently active duties in this region Lire a result of desertification due to human influences. Recent investigations in the dry lands of China and Mongolia demonstrate broad regional differences that must be given attention for the understanding of palacoclimates.

J	Carter, L; Orpin, AR; Kuehl, SA				Carter, Lionel; Orpin, Alan R.; Kuehl, Steven A.			From mountain source to ocean sink - the passage of sediment across an active margin, Waipaoa Sedimentary System, New Zealand	MARINE GEOLOGY												The joint US-NZ Source-to-Sink initiative aims to unravel the tectonic, climatic and other processes that shape the landscape from the mountains to deep ocean. Of two focus areas chosen world-wide, the Waipaoa Sedimentary System (WSS) of north-eastern New Zealand was identified as an example of a mid-latitude, high sediment input system. It resides within the westerly wind belt and extends across the convergence zone of the Australian and Pacific plates. Accordingly, the tectonic and climatic drivers are prominent and their influences on the WSS are decipherable as is documented in the suite of Source-to-Sink studies presented in this special issue of Marine Geology. The WSS is forced at several temporal and spatial scales, which collectively appear as short-term events (storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) superimposed on long-term, behavioural shifts (tectonic uplift and eustatic sea level change). Overall, the WSS is undergoing uplift, which has been contributing to valley incision since the Last Glacial Maximum. Uplift is both gradual and intermittent, the latter relating to fault- and subduction-related earthquakes. Such seismic activity destabilises the landscape and, together with frequent storms, generates large amounts of sediment. As this sediment passes through the system, part is captured in traps formed by local subsidence of the coastal plain and middle continental shelf where large thicknesses of Holocene and probably older sediment are sequestered (e.g., similar to 200 m under the coastal plain). Nevertheless, substantial sediment still reaches the continental slope to accumulate in canyon heads and slope basins with other deposits redistributed down-slope in mass flows. Major volcanic eruptions also affect the sediment flux via direct input from ash-fall and by enhanced erosion following volcanic destruction of terrestrial vegetation. Frequent storms of varying intensity play a key role in the generation and transfer of sediment. Major events such as Cyclone Bola of 1988, inundated the shelf with sediment, but identifiable flood deposits were preserved only locally, attesting to the effectiveness of shelf physical and biological mixing regimes. Despite the storms, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the largest perturbation of the WSS, at least in the last similar to 2400 years, has been the human deforestation of the landscape. The resultant influx of sediment overwhelmed the shelf's storage capacity. Instead of capturing 90% the fluvial input, as in pre-human times, the modern shelf retains only similar to 25%, the remainder escaping to the slope and elsewhere. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

J	Camacho, A; de Wit, R				Camacho, A; de Wit, R			Effect of nitrogen and phosphorus additions on a benthic microbial mat from a hypersaline lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The effect of the increase in availability of inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) on a benthic microbial mat from the hypersaline Lake Salada de Chiprana (NE Spain) was assayed by nutrient-addition experiments in mesocosms, using 16 d incubation periods. The upper layer of the mat was dominated by diatoms, whereas the cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes and filamentous green bacteria containing Bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) d dominated deeper layers. The addition of nitrogen alone favoured an increase in total abundance of diatoms with respect to cyanobacteria, although without significant changes in the relative abundance of different diatom genera. Furthermore, this treatment resulted in decreased rates of gross oxygenic photosynthesis. In contrast, phosphorus additions, either alone or supplemented with nitrogen, increased the relative abundance of cyanobacteria with respect to diatoms. No direct effects of the different treatments on green bacteria were observed. The balanced availability of high amounts of both N and P supported an increase in biomass of oxygenic phototrophic populations, especially cyanobacteria. This was attributed to a combination of stimulating active growth and decreasing senescence; the latter was reflected by more than 3-fold increase of the ratio of chl a to phaeophytin a. Dinitrogen fixation was measured indirectly as acetylene reduction activity (ARA). ARA rates were low at the start of the experiments and remained low in the N treatment, while a strong stimulation was found in the control, P and N+P treatments. Because M chthonoplastes is not capable of fixing dinitrogen, the stimulation of ARA was attributed to nitrogenase activities of heterotrophic bacteria. Our findings are generally in agreement with the resource ratio theory that predicts directional changes of community structure as a consequence of changing resource supply ratios. In addition to the effect of nutrient supply regimes on taxonomic structure of benthic communities, we also observed changes in some of their functional properties. However, application of this theory to sediment systems is not straightforward, because nutrient supply rates depend on the combined effect of mass transfer from the water column to the sediment, internal recycling and geochemical processes (precipitation/dissolution) in the sediment. Sediment processes are difficult to quantify.

The aim was to observe possible changes in water quality during the past decade and its influence on the downstream section of the Cetina River and its numerous tributaries and reservoirs, where there are two large regional water supply systems. This reservoir was built in order to exploit the high hydro-electric potential of small streamflows in the karst fields of south-western Bosnia. It has strongly influenced the hydrologic conditions of the downstream section of the Cetina River. Busko Blato is a relatively shallow reservoir with the mean depth of 5 m. It covers an area of 57 km(2). The water exchange in the reservoir is slow, occurring from one to several years. When the water inflow exceeds the hydroelectric plant demands the excess water is delivered by a reversible channel and pre-pumped into the Busko Blato reservoir. The total and carbonate water hardness in the reservoir is lower than in the Cetina River and in typical karst streamflows, since the water in this reservoir comes mainly from surface sources including numerous springs with high capacity oscillations, torrents and rainfall. Measurements, carried out during the past years, showed a significant increase in nitrate content as well as in the coli bacteria and a less significant increase in total phosphorus content. The water quality was evaluated as mezotrophic according to the total phosphorus content based on the Carlson index of trophic level, a lower quality than in the Peruca reservoir, upstream on the Cetina River. The latter contains a smaller phosphorus content and was classed between oligotrophic and mezotrophic. According to these data, employing the Vollenweider equation, the total phosphorus content in this water should not exceed the mean of 20 mg m(-3) P. The results indicate that the water in the Busko Blato reservoir did not deteriorate the water quality on the downstream section of the Cetina River.																			0167-6369					OCT	2001	71	3					279	296		10.1023/A:1011806218107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011806218107								11683233					WOS:000170993900006

Seepage carbonate mounds in Cenozoic sedimentary sequences from the Las Minas Basin, SE Spain	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A number of carbonate mounds composed of indurate, strongly folded and/or brecciated calcite and dolomite beds occur interstratified in Cenozoic sedimentary sequences from the Las Minas Basin. Part of the fabric of the rock forming the carbonate mounds is composed of laminated to banded dolostone similar to the host rock but showing contrasted lithification. Moreover, the carbonate deposits of the mounds display aggrading neomorphism of dolomite, partial replacement of dolomite by calcite, calcite cementation, and extensive silicification, locally resulting in box-work fabric. Eight main lithofacies were distinguished in the carbonate mound deposits. In some lithofacies, chert is present as both microcrystalline to fibro-radial quartz and opal, the latter occurring mainly as cement whereas the former replace the carbonate and infill voids. Yet one of the carbonate mounds shows distinctive petrography and geochemical features thus suggesting a distinctive growth pattern. The carbon isotope compositions of calcite from the mound samples range from -11.56 to -5.15 delta parts per thousand whilst dolomite is depleted in C-13, with values of -12.38 to 3.02 delta parts per thousand. Oxygen isotopic compositions vary from -9.42 to -4.64 B. for calcite and between 6.68 and 8.19 delta parts per thousand for dolomite. Carbonate in the mounds shows significant enrichment in Co, Cr, Ni and Pb content, especially in the strongly deformed (F-2-2 lithofacies) and brecciated carbonate (F-4). The carbonate deposits show depletion in REE and Y in contrast to that determined in lutite. The formation of the carbonate mounds was related to local artesian seepage thermal water flows of moderate to relative high temperatures. Pressure differences between the low permeability host rock and the circulating fluids accounted for dilational fracturing and brecciation of the host sediment packages, which combined with precipitation of new carbonate and silica mineral phases. Locally, some carbonate mounds developed where groundwater intersected the lake floor, this resulting in bedded carbonate deposits composed of organic constituents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Halas, A; Lamentowicz, M; Luców, D; Slowinski, M				Halas, Agnieszka; Lamentowicz, Mariusz; Lucow, Dominika; Slowinski, Micha			Developing a new testate amoeba hydrological transfer function for permafrost peatlands of NW Siberia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The vast areas of permafrost peatlands in the West Siberian Lowland (WSL) hold a significant amount of carbon currently at risk due to human-caused global warming. The rapid thawing of about 20-60% of the frozen soils of Western Siberia adds to the destruction of the region's signature palsa landscape and the development of thermokarst lakes or fens. Due to the complex interactions between climate and the ecosystem that shape its formation and degradation, permafrost reacts in different ways to environ-mental changes. Understanding recent changes in Western Siberia requires knowledge of previous environmental transitions, which needs to be enhanced further. This study, aimed to create a hydro-logical testate amoebae (TA) transfer function (TF) from the Khanymei area in the WSL to reconstruct past hydrological conditions in permafrost peatlands. In addition, this research intended to examine the influence of TA communities living in lichens (genus Cladonia) on the performance of TF by integrating these data with a calibration data set. In the summer of 2019, 76 modern samples of Sphagnum, Cladonia, and vascular plants from permafrost and non-permafrost sites were collected. Moreover, one peat core was extracted from the same area to reconstruct the depth to water table (DWT) quantitatively. The Shannon's diversity index, a quantitative measure of species richness, was calculated for each sample to estimate the TA species diversity in a community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was applied to the dataset to explore the similarities in TA communities between samples and determine whether the DWT controls the TA community structure. Results showed that the typical transition of TA species along the microtopographic (wet-dry) gradient is influenced by the presence of lichens on the surface of the peatland. Statistical analysis confirmed that TA communities in Cladonia are less affected by DWT. Therefore, the TF was constructed on the entire dataset (n 1/4 75) and the dataset with Cladonia excluded (n 1/4 55). Both these TFs showed satisfactory results. Even though the TF constructed on the entire dataset showed fewer predictive abilities, it provided a complete picture of the current vegetation conditions of Khanymei peatlands, where lichens are an essential element of the ecosystem. Therefore, it is assumed that TF with local environment traits may be more suitable for quantitative reconstruction, particularly in the newly explored permafrost area of Western Siberia.

J	Wright, PJ; Tillitt, DE				Wright, PJ; Tillitt, DE			Embryotoxicity of Great Lakes lake trout extracts to developing rainbow trout	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Planar halogenated hydrocarbons (PHHs), such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and biphenyls are present in aquatic systems, and are known to produce adverse effects in fish. This study investigated the embryotoxicity of PHH mixtures through the nanoinjection of environmental extracts into newly fertilized eggs from two strains of rainbow trout. Organic extracts were obtained from whole adult lake trout collected from Lake Michigan in 1988 and Lake Superior in 1994. The graded doses of the final extracts used for injection were quantified as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic-equivalents (TEQs) based on the concentrations of dioxins, furans and non-o-PCBs in each, and as equivalent amounts found in the eggs of the original lake trout (eggEQ). Total TEQs in the lake trout were 14.7 pg TEQ/g in the Lake Michigan sample and 7.3 pg TEQ/g in the Lake Superior sample. The extract of the Lake Michigan lake trout was embryotoxic to rainbow trout; LD(50) Values were 35 eggEQ (15-90, 95% F.L.) in the Arlee strain and 14 eggEQ (5-99, 95% F.L.) in the Erwin strain of rainbow trout. The LD(50) values of the Lake Michigan extract in either of these strains of rainbow trout fall within the actual range of TCDD LD(50) values based on TEQs. This indicates that an additive model of toxicity is appropriate to quantify PHHs in relation to early life stage mortality in fish. Gross lesions characteristic of exposure to PHHs (i.e. yolk-sac edema, craniofacial deformities, and hemorrhaging) increased in a dose-related manner. The lowest observable adverse effect concentrations (LOAEC) for these gross lesions and cumulative mortalities suggests that current concentrations of PHHs in lake trout from Lake Michigan are above a threshold for adverse effects and these compounds may have implications on the lack of recruitment in certain Great Lakes lake trout populations.

Microbial abundance across a salinity and mineralogical transect in the Ntwetwe Pan of Botswana: A terrestrial analogue for playa deposits on Mars	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												The current conditions of the Martian surface are considered prohibitive for life as we know it, due to strong radiation, highly oxidizing conditions, concentrated evaporative salts (including highly toxic perchlorates), and relatively low water activity. Earth hosts a multitude of extreme environments whose physico-chemical properties partly match Martian conditions. Such environments are defined as "analogue sites" and may offer a critical test-bed for astrobiological studies in characterizing the physical and chemical boundaries within which terrestrial life may exist and in assessing the habitability of Mars, and understanding the biological mechanisms for survival in extreme environments. For example, the Makgadikgadi Basin, located in central Botswana is considered one of the largest evaporitic basins on Earth, characterized by deposition of NaCl crusts from brines and surface water, high UV radiation and strong evaporitic conditions. These conditions may be compared with those detected on the Martian surface and/ or hypothesized for early Mars. Here, we provide, for the first time, a comparison between the abundance of microorganisms (both bacteria and fungi) and the chemical and physical properties of the surficial sediments from the Ntwetwe Pan, in the western Makgadikgadi Basin, providing a description of the morphological characteristics of halophilic communities and highlighting interactions with different mineral phases. These results show that fungi communities are more prone to variations due to changes in salinity and evaporite mineralogy. In general, the abundant filaments found in the surface sediments of the Makgadikgadi pans provide templating for the nucleation of carbonates and other evaporitic minerals such as trona and thenardite. This study draws links between the effects of a hypersaline environment on the survival potential (abundance) of microorganisms and their preservation potential within mineral phases. Studies of the Makgadikgadi pans could help to understand if hypothetical life-forms may exist or have existed on Mars, and if they are likely to be preserved in the evaporitic playa deposits described across the planet.

J	Miller, GH; Wolfe, AP; Steig, EJ; Sauer, PE; Kaplan, MR; Briner, JP				Miller, GH; Wolfe, AP; Steig, EJ; Sauer, PE; Kaplan, MR; Briner, JP			The Goldilocks dilemma: big ice, little ice, or "just-right" ice in the Eastern Canadian Arctic	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Our conceptions of the NE sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have evolved through three major paradigms over the past 50 years. Until the late 1960s the conventional view was that the Eastern Canadian Arctic preserved only a simple deglacial sequence from a LIS margin everywhere at the continental shelf edge (Flint Paradigm). Glacial geologic field studies began in earnest in this region in the early 1960s, and within the first decade field evidence documenting undisturbed deposits predating the LGM led a pendulum swing to a consensus view that large coastal stretches of the Eastern Canadian Arctic remained free of actively eroding glacial ice at the LGM, and that the most extensive ice margins occurred early in the last glacial cycle. This Minimalist Paradigm dominated until the late 1980s when an expanded data set from shallow marine studies indicated LGM ice at least locally reached the continental shelf. Within the past decade the marine data, coupled with new evidence from lake sediments and cosmogenic exposure dates on moraines and glaciated terrain in the Eastern Canadian Arctic has led to a new paradigm that better reconciles the terrestrial and marine evidence. Collectively, these lines of evidence indicate that all of southern Baffin Island was glaciated at the LGM, but that some coastal uplands north of Cumberland Sound remained above the limit of actively eroding glacial ice, even though outlet glaciers reached the continental shelf in front of most fiords and sounds. The most plausible explanation for the observed glacial limits is that low-gradient, relatively fast-moving outlet glaciers sliding on deformable sediments occupied marine embayments and fiords, contrasting with slower moving ice frozen to its bed on the intervening crystalline terrain. Slow-moving ice frozen to its bed would have had steeper surface gradients, hence would have terminated inland from the coast. This scenario is consistent with observations indicating high-elevation coastal terrain remained unglaciated even though outlet glaciers reached the continental shelf. LGM summer temperatures were apparently much lower than present, as lakes in the ice-free regions were permanently frozen. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Shukla, T; Sen, IS; Sundriyal, S				Shukla, Tanuj; Sen, Indra S.; Sundriyal, Shipika			Carbon emissions from emerging glacier-fed Himalayan lakes	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Glacial lakes are rapidly emerging in the Himalayas as glacier mass wastage rates in the region nearly doubled in recent times. Yet, the weathering-carbon feedbacks in the glacial lakes are poorly constrained limiting our ability to predict how these newly forming and expanding lakes will modulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. In this study, we quantify the sources and process of carbon cycling in small-sized (<= 0.4 km2) glacier-fed Himalayan lakes during summer time and evaluated the role of glacial lakes and streams in the atmospheric carbon budget. We find that glacier-fed Himalayan lakes and streams are expected to emit CO2 up to 1746 +/- 139 mg C m- 2 d-1 and 1960 +/- 176 mg C m- 2 d-1, respectively, which is mostly controlled by dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes. Using the glacial-lake inventory database, we estimate that the smaller glacial lakes in the Himalayas have the potential to emit-0.1 Tg C yr- 1 to the atmosphere. As recent findings suggest that the existing lakes in the "Third Pole" have undergone >45% expansion in an area with a rapid expansion rate of +14.44 km2 yr- 1 be-tween 1976 and 2018, we conclude that CO2 emission from these smaller and newly developed Himalayan glacier-fed lakes and streams would be an important emerging component of carbon budgets in the glacierized Himalayan catchments, and its contribution will increase in future.Plain language summary: Glacial lakes are emerging worldwide in response to melting glaciers. However, their role in carbon cycling is still underexplored. The lack of direct observational datasets on carbon fluxes, as well as their CO2 feedback mechanisms in glacial catchments has made it challenging to determine the impact of glacier -weathering-carbon feedbacks on the concentration of atmospheric CO2. Here, we quantify the CO2 emitting potential of glacier-fed lakes and streams. By studying the carbon biogeochemistry of small (<= 0.4 km2) glacier -fed Himalayan lakes and streams, we show that small lakes are a significant emitter of atmospheric CO2 controlled by dissolved inorganic carbon. We suggest that CO2 emission from small glacial lakes is an emer-ging-and not an inert-component of the regional carbon budget.One-sentence summary: Small glacial-fed Himalayan lakes emit -0.1 Tg C yr- 1 to the atmosphere contributing to the annual carbon budget estimates of glacierized Himalayan catchments.

J	Maurice, PA; Cabaniss, SE; Drummond, J; Ito, E				Maurice, PA; Cabaniss, SE; Drummond, J; Ito, E			Hydrogeochemical controls on the variations in chemical characteristics of natural organic matter at a small freshwater wetland	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												This study investigated the spatiotemporal variability in dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]), natural organic matter (-NOM) weight average molecular weight and absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon(280), an estimator of aromaticity) at McDonalds Branch, a first-order stream that is a fen wetland. When ground-water discharge to the stream was predominant, the [DOC], M-w and were all relatively low. When soil pore water represented an important contribution to streamflow, not only was the [DOC] higher, but also the M-w and Hence, the contribution of soil pore water relative to ground water controlled not only the concentration but also the average physicochemical characteristics of the NOM. Combined field and laboratory experiments suggested that preferential adsorption of higher M-w more aromatic NOM components to mineral surfaces, most likely within the lower soil horizons, resulted in a lower M-w more aliphatic ground-water NOM pool, This process ultimately affected surface water as ground water discharged to the lower reaches of the stream. Within the stream, higher molecular weight, more aromatic components were susceptible to photo-aggregation and photo-degradation, in the presence of Fe. Results from this small watershed study provide insight into climatic effects on surface-water NOM characteristics in a small freshwater fen. Low flow periods resulted in lower M-w more aliphatic NOM derived primarily from ground-water discharge to the stream, whereas higher flow periods resulted in a higher M-w (by 150-500 Da, i.e., increased by as much as 25%), more aromatic downstream surface-water NOM pool, Hence, during future summer drought periods, as suggested by climate-change models for much of North America, surface-water NOM likely will be lower molecular weight, more aliphatic, and more hydrophilic with lesser metal binding and hydrophobic organic carbon (HOC) uptake abilities [Environ. Sci, Technol, 34 (2000) 1103]. along with decreased ability to attenuate UV radiation. Because NOM plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation, research on climate-induced effects on aquatic ecosystems needs to consider not only decreases in NOM concentration and photochemistry but also hydrology-induced changes to the NOM physicochemical characteristics.

Reconnaissance sediment and microfossil analyses of a laminated short piston core from Lake Tekapo, South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												A 2.2 m piston core from the main basin of Lake Tekapo comprises milimetre-centimetre-scale alternations of light and dark laminae. Two much thicker layers occur near the base of the core and are interpreted as major slump deposits. Light laminae are predominantly fine silts with low microfossil concentrations. Dark laminae have higher clay, mica, and microfossil content and higher planktic/benthic diatom ratios. These findings are consistent with light laminae being deposited during times of high river flow and high sediment input, the thickness and number forming a proxy for paleoclimate (rainfall, water inflow. and erosion rates), and the dark laminae being deposited by settling out of the water column during periods of low inflow. The distribution of pollen from plants introduced to New Zealand by Europeans, and the inconsistency of dominant pollen types between samples, suggests that the entire sequence is only c. 100 yr old and that couplets of light and dark laminae form more frequently than annually. With appropriate processing, diatoms, spores, and pollen are present in great enough numbers in the dark laminae to be used for paleoclimate reconstruction. Diatoms are predominantly planktic lacustrine forms with some benthic forms sourced from the lake margins. Pollen and spores are derived from local grasslands, montane forest, fell fields, and tussock lands, and from West Coast lowland forest. Palynornorphs are carried over the central Southern Alps by prevailing northwesterly winds, and are deposited in the lake. The presence of fresh-looking Casuarina and possibly Banksia and Eucalyptus pollen shows that it is likely that some pollen came from Australia. It is believed that the presence and abundance of West Coast derived pollen, particularly Dacrydium cupressinum, and to a lesser extent Ascarina lucida, Nothofagus, and Podocarpus/Prumnopitys species, could be used as a proxy for the intensity and persistence of northwesterly winds.

Costs and benefits of a multi-generation captive broodstock Chinook Salmon hatchery program	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective We evaluated a 19-year captive broodstock hatchery program initiated in 1997 in the White River in central Washington State to contribute to recovery of the upper Columbia River endangered spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha population.Methods Fertilized eggs and fry were collected in the White River and transported to hatcheries in Washington State, where the fish were raised from 1 to 5 years until sexually mature and spawned. The offspring of these matings were reared to the yearling presmolt stage in a hatchery and transported to the White River or Lake Wenatchee for final acclimation and then released into surrounding areas.Results In total, 10,353 eggs and fry were collected for brood, which equated to about three females' eggs. These were collected from 122 redds between 1998 and 2009 and were used to produce 944,606 smolts. The number of produced adults that returned to Bonneville Dam was 685, but only 61 of those returned to spawn in the White River. The program did not increase natural-origin spawners relative to those observed in unsupplemented control rivers and did not consistently meet a viability standard of 20 redds created by natural-origin spawners. Some reasons for low numbers of captive brood adults returning to the White River included (1) high rates of male precocity, (2) low postrelease survival, and (3) high adult stray rates.Conclusions Although the program produced over 900,000 more smolts and about 52 more adults in the White River than would have been produced if no hatchery intervention occurred, the program did not meet recovery objectives, posed risk to target and nontarget populations, and cost over US$28 million to implement. The marginal gains in adult Chinook Salmon abundance produced from a 19-year long captive broodstock hatchery program were likely offset by the risks posed to target and nontarget populations and the cost of nearly US$0.5 million per adult returned.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2025	45	3					402	419		10.1093/najfmt/vqaf020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/najfmt/vqaf020		MAY 2025											WOS:001491080200001

A comparison of three Eurasian chironomid-climate calibration datasets on a W-E continentality gradient and the implications for quantitative temperature reconstructions	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Multiple regional chironomid-climate calibration datasets are available to reconstruct quantitatively July air temperatures from fossil chironomid assemblages. We examined the relationship between July air temperature and the 40 most common chironomid taxa in three independent Eurasian calibration (training) sets. The estimated temperature optimum of each chironomid taxon is systematically lower (by similar to 1-2 A degrees C) in a Norwegian calibration set compared to Finnish and Russian calibration sets. This result might partly be explained by the fact that the Norwegian calibration set extends further at the cold end of the temperature gradient. A difference in continentality between the Russian sites and the European sites might also contribute to this pattern. The number of taxa that show a statistically significant unimodal response to temperature is higher in the Norwegian calibration set (34 out of 40 taxa) compared to the modern Finnish (11 of 37 taxa; 3 common taxa absent) and the Russian calibration set (20 of 40 taxa), probably due to the longer temperature gradient incorporated in the Norwegian calibration set. We applied all three calibration sets to fossil chironomid assemblages from the high-latitude study site of Sokli (northeast Finland), a site with a unique series of lacustrine deposits covering (amongst others) the Holocene, part of early MIS 3 (at similar to 53 ka) and MIS 5d-c (at similar to 110-95 ka) and with independent proxy-records for comparison. In the early Holocene and during MIS 5c, the chironomid-based temperature inferences from all three inference models had similar values. Temperature reconstructions based on the Norwegian calibration set are 2-4 A degrees C lower for the late Holocene, early MIS 3 and MIS 5d than the inferred temperatures based on the other calibration sets. Although the lakes included in the Finnish calibration set are located closest to the site of Sokli, evaluation tests and a comparison with independent proxy data suggests that the Norwegian calibration set provides the most suitable analogues for reconstruction purposes for most of the fossil assemblages. Our results imply that when choosing a calibration set for quantitative climate reconstructions on glacial timescales, regional proximity of the fossil site may not be a sufficient basis, and the length of the temperature gradient of the calibration dataset and factors such as the continentality gradient covered by the calibration set must also be considered.

Field and laboratory studies on the bottom fauna from the profundal zone of Lake Esrom, Denmark	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The three macroinvertebrate taxa, Potamothrix hammoniensis, Chironomus anthracinus and Pisidium spp. are permanent inhabitants of the regularly microxic/anoxic profundal zone in Lake Esrom. In situ and laboratory studies (10 degrees C) of metabolism (aerobic and anaerobic) and anaerobic survival in P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp. are compared with previous results from C. anthracinus. The late summer microxic conditions in the lake lasts 2-21/2 months, during which the three taxa display metabolic and behavioral strategies in order to survive. All three are respiratory oxy-regulators with critical oxygen levels at 1 mg O-2 l(-1) (P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp.) or 2-3 mg O-2 l(-1) (C. anthracinus). The lethal time (LD50) in experimental anoxia follows a similar trend, with 150-170 days of survival in P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp., compared to 2-5 weeks in C. anthracinus. The glycogen stores are almost (C. anthracinus) or fully exploited (P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp.) during anaerobis and the animals finally enter a state of quiescence or dormancy. During the late phase of anoxia, their metabolism is down at (C. anthracinus) or below (P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp.) 1% of normoxic metabolism. The populations in the lake behave rather similar in so far that the energy gain from anaerobic degradation of glycogen maximizes 1% of normoxic conditions regardless of species. Also, in Pisidium this appears to be the only energy source during dormancy. However, as previously presented in case of C. anthracinus, P. hammoniensis maintain a partly aerobic metabolism constituting 44% of normoxia during the microxic period, compared to the 12-19% obtained by C. anthracinus. It is thus demonstrated that P. hammoniensis and Pisidium spp. possess a remarkable ability to survive in situ severe oxygen depletion. P. hammoniensis can benefit from the presence of merely traces of oxygen, whereas C. anthracinus with poorer anaerobic survival is strongly dependent on minute oxygen supplies.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2000	432	1-3					173	188		10.1023/A:1004098910718	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004098910718													WOS:000089348100017

These recent changes can be placed into a longer-term context of postglacial lake-level fluctuations that include low stands that were as much as 7 m lower than present at eight lakes on the Kenai Lowland. Closed-basin lakes on the Kenai Lowland are typically ringed with old shorelines, usually as wave-cut scarps, cut several meters above modern lake levels; the scarps formed during deglaciation at 25-19 ka in a kettle moraine topography on the western Kenai Lowland. These high-water stands were followed by millennia of low stands, when closed-basin lake levels were drawn down by 5-10 m or more. Peat cores from satellite fens near or adjoining the eight closed-basin lakes show that a regional lake level rise was underway by at least 13.4 ka. At Jigsaw Lake, a detailed study of 23 pairs of overlapping sediment cores, seismic profiling, macrofossil analysis, and 58 AMS radiocarbon dates reveal rapidly rising water levels at 9-8 ka that caused large slabs of peat to slough off and sink to the lake bottom. These slabs preserve an archive of vegetation that had accumulated on a lakeshore apron exposed during the preceding drawdown period. They also preserve evidence of a brief period of lake level rise at 4.7-4.5 ka. We examined plant succession using in situ peat sequences in nine satellite fens around Jigsaw Lake that indicated increased effective moisture between 4.6 and 2.5 ka synchronous with the lake level rise. Mid- to late-Holocene lake high stands in this area are recorded by numerous ice-shoved ramparts (ISRs) along the shores. ISRs at 15 lakes show that individual ramparts typically record several shove events, separated by hundreds or thousands of years. Most ISRs date to within the last 5200 years and it is likely that older ISRs were erased by rising lake levels during the mid- to late Holocene. This study illustrates how data on vegetation changes in hydrologically coupled satellite-fen peat records can be used to constrain the water level histories in larger adjacent lakes. We suggest that this method could be more widely utilized for paleo-lake level reconstruction.

Numerical analyses (PCA; CONISS) reveal three main phases in the development of the lake. Response to the Lateglacial-Holocene transition in Lake A A << A3/4i took place around 11,300 cal. BP. Organogenic sedimentation started with distinctive 5-cm-thick peat layer and was followed by lacustrine sedimentation of carbonaceous gyttja. Several findings of the peat layer with similar dated age and position at different absolute altitudes indicate that lake basin was formed by glaciokarstic processes. In the Early Holocene (until around 8,500 cal. BP), the lake was shallow and holomictic, surrounded by unstable catchment with erosion and inflow events. Predominance of diatom species of Cyclotella and Tabellaria, large numbers of respiratory horns of phantom midge pupae (Chaoboridae), high Fe/Mn ratio, as well as the presence of laminated sediments indicates the transition to a dimictic and oligo-mesotrophic lake conditions with high water level, anoxia in the near-bottom and stable catchment in the Middle Holocene (8,500-2,000 cal. BP). This contrasts with many hydrologically sensitive lakes in Northern and Eastern Europe in which the water level fell several meters during this period. During the Late Holocene (from 2,000 cal. BP to the present), the lithological and biotic variables reveal major changes, such as the increase in erosion (coarser grain-size fraction) and eutrophication [diatoms Aulacoseira ambigua (Grun.) Sim., Stephanodiscus spp., Cyclostephanos dubius (Fricke) Round]. Characteristics of lake-catchment system during the Late Holocene reflect anthropogenic signal superimposed on the natural forcing factors. To date, the Late Quaternary palaeolimnological reconstructions using lake sediment has been limited in the Baltic region. Therefore, findings from Lake A A << A3/4i provide important information about environmental and climatic changes that took place in this part of Eastern Europe. This study shows that the relative importance of climate and local factors has varied over the time and it is essential to consider the lake basin topography, catchment size and land cover as potential dominant forcing factors for changes in sedimentary signal.					; Vaasma, Tiit/LIF-3190-2024; Terasmaa, Jaanus/E-7077-2018	Terasmaa, Jaanus/0000-0002-1346-6411; Vandel, Egert/0000-0003-2552-5607; Vaasma, Tiit/0009-0003-4483-1471													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2013	49	4					663	678		10.1007/s10933-013-9683-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9683-0													WOS:000316888900009
J	Iqbal, MZ; Brown, EJ; Clayton, ME				Iqbal, MZ; Brown, EJ; Clayton, ME			Distribution of phosphorus in a biologically restricted lake in Iowa, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The impact of soil runoff phosphorus on the Silver Lake of Iowa was assessed in this study. Currently, the lake cannot support its designated uses as a recreational water body. Extensive algal blooms characterize the lake in late summer, lowering the dissolved oxygen content in water (< 2.0 mg/L). The goal of this study was to map the long-term buildup of phosphorus in the lake sediments and come up with recommendations for restoration strategies. Sediment cores were taken from 20 sites along five transects in the lake. In 10 of these 20 sites, P content exceeds 600 mu g/gm of sediments. In general, a strong vertical gradient is observed in which P decreases with depth. The average P levels in the contaminated sediments are 848 mu g/gm at 0-5 cm, 666 mu g/gm at 10-15 cm, and 420 mu g/gm at 20-25 cm. Further examining the cores, the average P content at 30-35 cm depth was calculated as 293 mu g/gm. The above results indicate that sediments in Silver Lake are heavily contaminated with soil runoff P. mostly coming from the surrounding croplands and an active hog lot on the southeastern lakeshore. In addition to deteriorating aesthetic value, the P loading into Silver Lake from the watershed holds a potential threat to the local population by way of introducing cyanobacterial biotoxins to the environment. The average rate of sedimentation in the lake has been 1 cm/year in the last 30 years. The annual loading of P from land to lake was calculated as 1.44 x 10(3) kg (1.42 tons). This incoming mass of P was found distributed in the lake as 1.15 X 10(3) kg (80%) in bottom sediments, 21.3 kg (1.5%) in suspended particulates, 70.6 kg (4.9%) in the dissolved phase, and 198 kg (13.6%) used in growth of biomass and mineral complexes.

Aquatic vertebrates such as fish have been particularly sensitive during fertilisation, as the fertilisation of eggs involves rapid uptake of the surrounding water, reduction in egg swelling and in ovo exposure to high road salt concentrations. The present study aimed to identify the persistent molecular changes occurring in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) eggs after 24 h exposure to high concentrations (5000 mg/L) of road salt at fertilisation. The global transcriptional changes were monitored by a 60 k salmonid microarray at the eyed egg stage (cleavage stage, 255 degree days after fertilisation) and identified a high number of transcripts being differentially regulated. Functional enrichment, pathway and gene-gene interaction analysis identified that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly associated with toxiciologically relevant processes involved in osmoregulation, ionregulation, oxidative stress, metabolism (energy turnover), renal function and developmental in the embryos. Quantitative rtPCR analysis of selected biomarkers, identified by global transcriptomics, were monitored in the eggs for an extended range of road salt concentrations (0, 50, 100, 500 and 5000 mg/L) and revealed a positive concentration-dependent increase in cypa14, a gene involved in lipid turnover and renal function, and nav1, a gene involved in neuraxonal development. Biomarkers for osmoregulatory responses such as atp1a2, the gene encoding the main sodium/potassium ATP-fueled transporter for chloride ions, and txdc9, a gene involved in regulation of cell redox homeostasis (oxidative stress), displayed apparent concentration-dependency with exposure, although large variance in the control group precluded robust statistical discrimination between the groups. A No Transcriptional Effect Level (NOTEL) of 50 mg/L road salt was found to be several orders of magnitude lower than the adverse effects documented in developing fish embryos elsewhere, albeit at concentrations realistic in lotic systems receiving run-off from road salt. It remains to be determined whether these transcriptional changes may cause adverse effects in fish at ecologically relevant exposure concentrations of road salt. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	COLLINS, N				COLLINS, N			POPULATION ECOLOGY OF EPHYDRA-CINEREA JONES (DIPTERA, EPHYDRIDAE), THE ONLY BENTHIC METAZOAN OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The population of E. cinerea was studied during 3 summers when dissolved solid levels were about 130 g/l. All life stages are present year-round, but there is apparently some coordination of the initial pulse of adult emergence in June. There are probably 1-2 generations/yr. Eggs are deposited on the water surface; inputs to 3 locations were similar. Larvae successfully avoid the large benthic area covered by an anaerobic monimolimnion. They tend to immigrate from substrates where they grow relatively poorly, and to remain on substrates where they grow better. Larval densities are more than 10 times higher on reef and shallow water mud substrates than on sand. This marked spatial specialization in the absence of substrate-specific predators or competitors illustrates the power of habitat quality by itself in determining spatial patterns of abundance in a lake. Larval growth on the reef was inversely related to density, and the lake as a whole produced relatively larger flies in a year when larval and pupal densities were relatively low. Yearly production by E. cinerea is roughly 50 g/m2, about 88% of which comes from reefs and shallow water mud areas covering only 18% of the bottom area. Blue-green algae dominate the lake''s benthic flora when salt concentrations are high (due to low lake levels), and diatoms take over when salt concentrations are low. Fly abundance may be inversely related to salinity. The lake''s present high planktonic primary production is equal to that of eutrophic freshwater lakes, yet it has water clarity more characteristic of an oligotrophic lake. The high water clarity (which makes possible the high benthic production) probably depends on the absence of phytoplankters that can both tolerate the high salinity and avoid being eaten by Artemia salina. Continued dilution of the lake will probably upset this situation and result in reorganization of the lake''s energy flow pattern.					; Collins, Nicholas/F-2704-2010	Collins, Nicholas/0000-0002-6901-6604; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	68	2					99	112		10.1007/BF00019696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019696													WOS:A1980JE42800001
J	HART, RC				HART, RC			EMBRYONIC DURATION AND POST-EMBRYONIC GROWTH-RATES OF THE TROPICAL FRESH-WATER SHRIMP CARIDINA-NILOTICA (DECAPODA, ATYIDAE) UNDER LABORATORY AND EXPERIMENTAL FIELD CONDITIONS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Embryonic durations and post embryonic growth rates of C. nilotica were determined under laboratory conditions at constant temperatures near 18, 24 and 30.degree. C. Embryonic durations and intermolt intervals were negative curvilinear functions of temperature. At a given temperature, molting frequency varied inversely with shrimp size and slight sexual differences were apparent. Molting frequency of berried females was governed by the temperature-specific embryonic durations. Growth rates were determined from changes in carapace length (CL) of individual shrimps (laboratory) or batches of shrimps (field enclosures) over 1 mo.; these data were used to calculate temperature-specific life-long growth curves for males and females. Body mass growth was estimated indirectly from the carapace length-mass relationship of C. nilotica. Males grew marginally faster than females during the 1st 2 mo. of life, but growth of males larger than CL = 4 mm was considerably depressed relative to that of females. Inflexions in growth rate, apparently related to the onset of sexual maturity, were apparent in both sexes. Under laboratory conditions, the growth rate of males increased with temperature, but temperature-related differences were not as marked in females. Notwithstanding the more rapid molting rate at 30.degree. C, the growth rate of females was slightly slower at 30 than at 24.degree. C as a result of marginally but significantly smaller per molt growth increments observed at 30.degree. C in animals up to CL = 5.5 mm. Possible reasons for this depressed growth are discussed. Growth rates of animals in field enclosures in Lake Sibaya [South Africa] over 1 mo. in winter (20 .+-. 3.degree. C) were generally comparable to those estimated for the 18.degree. C laboratory experiments. Growth rates in enclosures containing tripled standing stocks were almost identical to those containing the naturally occurring biomass of animals, suggesting a non-limited environment at least during the experiment.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	4					297	+		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01205.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01205.x													WOS:A1980KC70900001

In the kidneys. If picked up by such sources as unclean sewage or long-term pollution, this can become chronic exposure to cadmium. Through the use of contaminated food or water supplies and also industrial pollution with metals and aerosols that enter our rivers and lakes, it finds its way in there to an even greater extent still It accumulates mainly in the kidneys. As a medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds, Ziziphus spina-christi was investigated for its possible protective effects against cadmium-induced kidney damage in rats.<br /> Methods: The adult male and female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided in four groups: control group, Ziziphus spina-christi treatment (ZSC), ZSC treatment plus cadmium; the blood samples for serum analysis at end of treatment and kidney tissuesfor histological examination were from harvested at the end of the treatment period, blood samples were collected for serum analysis. Kidney tissue was obtained for histological examination. The range of biochemical parameters-creatine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)and uric acid levels-were measured using diagnostic kits. Result: Cadmium exposure actually decreased the rats' kidney weight and increased the levels of creatinine, uric acid and BUN in the male and female animals, indicating renal toxicity. This cadmium-fact pathology was apparently renal in nature and included glomerular and tubular necrosis as well vascular congestion. While treating rats with ZSC alone had no negative effect on their kidney function and did not cause any reduction in normalizes its weight or biochemical parameters, it did so when you administered cadmium rats them concurrently with. Those animals that had been treated with both cadmium and ZSC however showed a partial recovery in kidney weight, while the levels of serum creatinine, BUN and uric acid all fell significantly compared to those animals receiving only cadmium. Histologically speaking, the kidney damage exhibited by rats in the combination treatment category was less severe: their renal architecture more intact than in animals exposed solely to cadmium.

C.; Derner, Justin D.; Pelzel-McCluskey, Angela; Drolet, Barbara; Rodriguez, Luis			Landscape dynamics of a vector-borne disease in the western US: How vector-habitat relationships inform disease hotspots	ECOSPHERE												Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a vector-borne viral disease that causes lesions in livestock, premises, county and state quarantines, and important economic losses. We investigated vector-habitat characteristics for vectors associated with VS in regions of recurrent disease within the western United States (US) that consistently lead to the environment where vector, host, and pathogen populations intersect to enable pathogen transmission. We analyzed the habitats of previously identified insect vectors, including black flies (BFs) (Simulium vittatum complex), biting midges (BMs) (Culicoides variipennis complex, which includes Culicoides sonorensis), and sand flies (SFs) (Lutzomyia shannoni) in six regions of interest (ROIs) containing hotspots of VS ranging from Texas (TX) to Wyoming. This analysis broadened the understanding of (1) how regions of reoccurring VS differ from the broader western US, (2) how geographically separated regions and hotspots are similar across time, and (3) how vector-environment habitat a priori knowledge relates to observed hotspots. Analysis of watershed factors (livestock densities, land-cover proportions, stream and lake densities, and irrigation methods) indicated a complex system separating areas with high, recurring VS from the broader western US. Although no single characteristic separated the six ROIs from other areas, we found two distinct emerging groups (northern ROI and TX). Hotspots, estimated from monthly VS concentrations, evolved northward throughout the year and most hotspots were closer to flowing water and agricultural land than the broader ROI. All ROIs contained environmental conditions suitable for multiple vectors at some point in the year, but BFs had the highest suitability scores, whereas BM scores were lower and varied annually with higher suitability in summer. SFs had the lowest suitability score in all ROIs, consistent with their low likelihood of being vectors. BM habitat patches were often orders of magnitude smaller than BF patches, and hotspot patches reinforce the likelihood that BF may be the most critical vector in northern ROI, whereas both BM and BF have similar likelihood in southern ROI. Given limited existing vector data, this analysis provides an alternate pathway for using habitat information to associate likely vectors responsible for transmission. Results could support early warning and mitigation efforts to reduce the incidence of VS.

Fifty-one new and thirty-nine re-calculated Be-10 and Al-26 exposure ages from Sinks and North Fork canyons, Stough Basin, Cirque of the Towers and the Temple Lake valley allow us to more tightly constrain the timing and sequence of glacial alloformations in the southern portion of the range. Moraines, diamicts and bedrock exposures here have previously been correlated with as many as five Pleistocene and four Holocene glacial events. Exposure ages from Pleistocene alloformations associated with trunk glaciers in Sinks Canyon and North Fork Canyon generally confirm earlier age estimates. Cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN, Be-10 and Al-26) ages from moraines and striated bedrock surfaces previously mapped as Pinedale correspond to MIS2, while boulder exposure ages from moraines mapped as Bull Lake correspond generally to MIS5-MIS6. Geomorphic data from a moraine previously mapped as Younger pre-Sacagawea Ridge appears to correspond most closely to the Sacagawea Ridge glacial episode (MIS-16), but the uncertainty of a single Be-10 exposure age suggests the unit could be as young as MIS-10 or as old as MIS-18. Boulders from a diamict on Table Mountain previously reported as Older pre-Sacagawea Ridge yield two Be-10 exposure ages that suggest the presence of Early Pleistocene glacial activity here possibly older than 1-2 Ma (>MIS-30). Bedrock exposure ages within Sinks Canyon suggest the Pinedale valley glacier had retreated from the floor of Sinks Canyon to above PopoAgie Falls by ca. 15.3 ka. Cirque glaciers in Stough Basin appear to have retreated behind their riegels by ca. 16 ka, which suggests the cirque glaciers were decoupling across their riegels from the valley glaciers below at this time, prior to their readvance to form Lateglacial moraines. New Be-10 boulder exposure ages from moraines previously correlated to the Temple Lake and Alice Lake allostratigraphic units in the cirques of Stough Basin and Cirque of the Towers show general equivalence to the stadial event just prior to the onset of the Bolling interstadial (17.5-14.7 ka) and to the Intra-Allerod Cold Period Younger Dryas stadial phase (13.9-11.7 ka), respectively. From this evidence, the Temple Lake Alloformation of the Wind River Mountains now should correspond to the INTIMATE GS-2.1a (Oldest Dryas) stadial event while the Alice Lake Alloformation should correspond to the INTIMATE GS-2 stadial (IACP-Younger Dryas). Thus, we consider that evidence no longer exists for early-to mid-Holocene glacial events in the southern Wind River Range. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Stahl, N; Hofstätter, M				Stahl, Natalie; Hofstaetter, Michael			Vb-tracks and their appearance in sequence with reference to floods in Bavaria including a case study of the impact on retention areas in the Isar catchment area	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG												Using the new catalogue of Vb-tracks (HOFSTATTER et al., 2017), it can be shown that between the years 1959 and 2015 Vb-tracks have been responsible for at least 30 % of all observed flood events during the period April to October (the months vary with the different observed gauges). With reference to the extreme flood events in the Danube catchment area, this percentage is even higher. In the summer months, every second Vb-track induces a flood. The evaluation of Vb-tracks is therefore of high importance for flood prevention in Bavaria. Furthermore, it is clear that in around 60 % of all observed cases Vb-tracks are sequential and at least one other low-pressure area follows on this track within a month. In the context of a demand for flood retention reservoirs to be resilient against multi-peak waves, this sequence of otherwise rare Vb-tracks is of high importance. For the catchment basin of the river Isar, a river very often hit by Vb-events, the interval between lows of a sequence - critical to the overlapping of waves - is discussed due to the fact that there is an abundance of natural lakes and a large reservoir, the Sylvensteinspeicher. Looking downstream of lakes with a high retention space, i.e. Lake Ammersee, double waves create much higher runoff than single waves due to the overlapping of the waves induced by the long retention branches. On the other hand, the alpine region and parts of the alpine foothills react with short and steep hydrograph curves and are less sensitive to double waves, as there is hardly any overlap of the waves. The Sylvensteinspeicher is situated in the alpine area and can therefore be discharged quickly even during short rainfall breaks to renew the retention volume. It could be expected that runoff caused by floods will augment due to climate change, because rising air temperature leads to more water saturation of the clouds. It is to be expected that flood events caused by Vb-tracks will be seen more often during April, May, September and October and will be more extreme during summertime.																			1439-1783					APR	2018	62	2					77	97		10.5675/HyWa_2018,2_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.5675/HyWa_2018,2_2													WOS:000428371500003
J	Bolch, CJS; Orr, PT; Jones, GJ; Blackburn, SI				Bolch, CJS; Orr, PT; Jones, GJ; Blackburn, SI			Genetic, morphological, and toxicological variation among globally distributed strains of Nodularia (cyanobacteria)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Morphological, toxicological, and genetic variation was examined among 19 strains of Nodularia. The strains examined could be morphologically discriminated into four groups corresponding to N. spumigena Mertens, N, sphaerocarpa Bornet et Flahault, and two strains that did not clearly correspond to currently accepted Nodularia species. Genetic variation was examined using nucleotide sequencing of the phycocyanin intergenic spacer region (cpcBA-IGS) and RAPD-PCR, The PCR-RFLP of the cpcBA-IGS differentiated four genotypes corresponding to the four morphological groups, However, nucleotide sequencing of 598 bp of the 690-bp fragment showed that one of the three strains corresponding to N. sphaerocarpa (PCC 7804) was genetically divergent from the other two, suggesting that it constitutes a distinct species. Nucleotide variation within the morphospecies groups was Limited (<1%), and all 14 Australian strains of N, spumigena possessed identical cpcBA-IGS sequences. The RAPD-PCR differentiated the same groups as the cpcBA sequencing and discriminated each of the seven different Australian populations of N. spumigena. Strains from within a bloom appeared genetically identical; however, strains isolated from different blooms could be separated into either a western or a southeastern Australian cluster, with one strain from western Australia showing considerable genetic divergence, The pattern of variation suggests that individual blooms of N. spumigena are clonal but also that Australian N. spumigena populations are genetically distinct from each other. Examination of genetic distance within and between blooms and within and between morphological groups showed clear genetic dicontinuities that, in combination with the cpcBA-IGS data, suggest that Nodularia contains genetically distinct morphospecies rather than a continuous dine of genetic variation, Furthermore, these morphospecies are genetically variable, exhibiting hierarchical patterns of genetic variation on regional and global scales. Production of the hepatotoxin nodularin was not restricted to one genetic lineage but was distributed across three of the five genotypic groups. A strain of N. spumigena from a nontoxic Australian population was found to fall within the range of genetic variation for other toxic Australian strains and appears to be a unique nontoxic strain that might have arisen by loss of toxin production capacity.

JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Herring from two unexploited fjord populations, Lake Rossfjord (LRH, n = 100) and Balsfjord (BFH, n = 420) in northern Norway, were sampled in 2014 and 2015. Life history characteristics were analysed and compared to the oceanic Norwegian spring-spawning herring (NSSH), and other Atlantic and Pacific herring stocks. Genetic studies have shown that LRH and BFH are ancestors evolved from Pacific herring that hybridized with Atlantic herring. This study shows that both LRH and BFH mature at a relatively early age, at 2-3 years and ca. 4 years respectively, compared to ca. 5 years for NSSH. The spawning stocks of LRH and BFH consist of small fish and contain relatively few age classes. Both fjord populations have slow growth after sexual maturity; LRH has a very low asymptotic length (L-infinity = 19.8 cm), while that of BFH is higher (L-infinity of 28.5 cm); both these values being lower than that of NSSH (L-infinity of ca. 37 cm). The somatic relative fecundity of LRH is 176.6 oocytes g(-1), while the somatic relative fecundity of recruit and repeat BFH spawners is 152.4 and 183.1 oocytes g(-1), respectively. These estimates are lower than those for NSSH and other Atlantic herring fjord populations, but comparable with other Pacific herring. Due to the smaller body sizes of the spawners in the LRH and BFH populations, absolute fecundity is much lower than in NSSH. The gonadosomatic indices of prespawning fish are similar in LRH and BFH, being slightly higher compared to the NSSH, but lower than values reported for Pacific herring. The natural mortality rates of LRH and BFH (M = 0,64 year(-1) and M = 0.76 year(-1), respectively) are much higher than in NSSH (M = 0.15 year(-1)) and most other Atlantic herring populations, except the Lusterfjord herring. However, these high mortality rates are similar to those of several Pacific herring populations. It is concluded that LRH and BFH show low somatic growth and high natural mortality rate. These life history characteristics differ from those of NSSH, but are similar to some Pacific herring populations adapted to a coastal high-mortality risk environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Disruption of the lower food web in Lake Ontario: Did it affect alewife growth or condition?	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					49th Annual Conference of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research	MAY 22-28, 2006	Univ Windsor, Windsor, CANADA	Int Assoc Great Lakers Res	Univ Windsor			From the early 1980s to the late 1990s, a succession of non-native invertebrates colonized Lake Ontario and the suite of consequences caused by their colonization became known as food web disruption. For example, the native burrowing amphipod Diporeia spp., a key link in the profundal food web, declined to near absence, exotic predaceous cladocerans with long spines proliferated, altering the zooplankton community, and depth distributions of fishes shifted. These changes had the potential to affect growth and condition of planktivorous alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, the most abundant fish in the lake. To determine if food web disruption affected alewife, we used change-point analysis to examine alewife growth and adult alewife condition during 1976-2006 and analysis-of-variance to determine if values between change points differed significantly. There were no change points in growth during the first year of life. Of three change points in growth during the second year of life, one coincided with the shift in springtime distribution of alewife to deeper water but it was not associated with a significant change in growth. After the second year of life, no change points in growth were evident, although growth in the third year of life spiked in those years when Bythotrephes, the largest of the exotic cladocerans, was abundant suggesting that it was a profitable prey item for age-2 fish. We detected two change points in condition of adult alewife in fall, but the first occurred in 1981, well before disruption began. A second change point occurred in 2003, well after disruption began. After the springtime distribution of alewife shifted deeper during 1992-1994, growth in the first two years of life became more variable, and growth in years of life two and older became correlated (P 0.05). In conclusion, food web disruption had no negative affect on growth and condition of alewife in Lake Ontario although it appears to have resulted in growth in the first two years of life becoming more variable, growth in years of life two and older becoming correlated (P 0.05), and growth spurts in year of life three.																			1463-4988						2008	11	4					392	402	PII 906371781	10.1080/14634980802515526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802515526													WOS:000261413500005

Lake water sampling was carried out during the 34th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ISEA) in the austral summer of 2014-2015. A total of 60 samples were collected from Grovnes & Broknes peninsula, Larsemann Hill, East Antarctica. The aim of this study was to investigate the physico-chemical parameters such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), chloride (Cl-), total hardness (TH), nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), phosphorus (P), sulphate (SO4--), cyanide (CN-), chlorine (Cl), sulphide (S--), and heavy metals like Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Cr in the collected samples. We also analysed indices like the potential ecological risk factor (Er) and potential ecological risk index (RI). We found pH (6.33-7.10), TDS (26.33-1128.0 mg/l), EC (0.06-2.25 mu S/cm), Cl- (5.09-117.07 mg/l), TH (10.18-122.16 mg/l), NO3- (0.02-0.61 mg/l), NO2- (0.02-1.32 mg/l), P (0.29-3.27 mg/l), SO4-- (1.08-10.15 mg/l), CN- (0.01-0.26 mg/l), Cl (0.06-2.17 mg/l), S-- (0.01-0.84 mg/l), Al (0.01-0.79 mu g/l), Fe (0.01-3.27 mu g/l), Mn (0.14-12.83 mu g/l), Zn (0.07-2.44 mu g/l), Cu (0.01-5.37 mu g/l), Ni (0.02-0.60 mu g/l), and Cr (0.01-0.82 mu g/l) in different ranges. We conclude that most of the parameters were found within the limits set by IS:10500 except some parameters like TDS was found higher in L6 NG, L7A NG, L7B NG, L1 SG, & L4 SG; Cl was found higher in L1E NG, P2 B, P3 B, P4 B, & Reid B; CN- was found higher in P2 B, & P4 B; S- was found higher in P2 B, P3 B, P4 B, & Reid B. In the future, the presence of new emerging pollutants like microplastics, and phthalate must be analysed in order to comprehensively assess the scale of environmental pollution in Antarctica.

J	Gebremichael, M; Mechal, A				Gebremichael, Mesay; Mechal, Abraham			Groundwater potential mapping using WetSpass-M and GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models in the Chamo Lake basin, Ethiopian rift	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The evaluation of the available groundwater potential is critical for the development and management of groundwater resources. In this regard, GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) plays a crucial role in prioritizing the groundwater potential of an area. In this study, the WetSpass-M and GIS-based MCDA models were used in an attempt to define the groundwater potential of Chamo Lake Basin (CLB), which is situated in the southern Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). The WetSpass-M model was used to simulate the water balance components, mainly the spatial variability of recharge (RCHG). The WetSpass-M model performance evaluated by Percent Bias was 11.84%, suggesting the applicability of the model. The long-term mean annual RCHG over the basin reveals remarkable spatial variability and varies from 39 mm/yr in the rift floor to 497 mm/yr in the highland. The simulated RCHG and other groundwater potential influencing thematic layers such as geomorphology, lithology, drainage density, and lineament density were examined using the GIS-based MCDA technique to delineate the GWPZs (groundwater potential zones) of the study area. Four GWPZs were identified in the CLB, namely very high, high, moderate, and low. According to the model result, 3.74% of the lake basin is identified as having a very high GWPZ, situated mostly in the western part, while 18.86% of the area is categorized as having a low GWPZ, found along the eastern part of the study area. The remaining 29.43% and 47.97% of the lake basin are identified as high and moderate GWPZs, respectively. The GWPZ results were validated against an independent set of groundwater inventory data (yields of wells and springs), showing 81% agreement. This integrated approach, combining the spatially distributed hydrological model WetSpass-M with GIS-based MCDA, offers an efficient and effective method for groundwater prospecting.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				APR	2025	11	2							40	10.1007/s40899-025-01214-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-025-01214-7													WOS:001446612300001
J	Spada, ME; Ringler, NH				Spada, ME; Ringler, NH			Invasion of Onondaga Lake, New York, by the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) following reductions in N pollution	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												An initial failed invasion by the zebra mussel, followed by an abrupt shift to dense populations, is documented for polluted, hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake. The Lake is located in a region of New York subject to high infestation rates by the zebra mussel. Our analysis was supported by: 1) monitoring of multiple life stages of the zebra mussel, including veligers, pediveliger deposition, and adults in the lake and an adjoining source river over a 4-y interval, 2) a quantitative substrate survey of the lake's nearshore zone, 3) in situ growth-rate experiments, and 4) long-term water-quality monitoring data for the lake. Despite the availability of appropriate substrate and food, near-optimal temperature and primary water chemistry requirements, and continuing inputs of veligers since the early 1990s, veliger concentrations (<0.2 individuals/L) and adult densities in the nearshore zone (<1 individual /m(2)) remained extremely low in the lake through 1998. This failure was caused by the toxic effects on early life stages from high lake concentrations of forms of N, particularly total ammonia (T-NH3) and free (unionized) ammonia (NH3), associated with discharges of a domestic waste-water-treatment plant (WWTP). The abrupt shift from extremely low to high densities in the summer of 1999 continued through 2000 (maximum of similar to65,000 individuals/m(2)), coincident with abrupt decreases in concentrations of T-NH3 and NH3 associated with increased treatment at the WWTP Water-quality monitoring data suggested that summertime T-NH3 and NH3 concentrations of similar to2 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively, were adequate to prevent the development of dense zebra mussel populations in the lake. The establishment of dense populations of zebra mussels in Onondaga Lake may complicate the resolution of impacts/benefits of an ongoing rehabilitation program to remediate domestic waste inputs in the lake.																			0887-3593					DEC	2002	21	4					634	650		10.2307/1468435	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468435													WOS:000179505500009
J	MCLANDRESS, MR				MCLANDRESS, MR			TEMPORAL CHANGES IN HABITAT SELECTION AND NEST SPACING IN A COLONY OF ROSS AND LESSER SNOW GEESE	AUK												The nesting colony of Ross'' geese (C. rossii) and lesser snow geese (C. c. caerulescens) at Karrak Lake in the central Arctic of Canada in the summer of 1976 was studied. Related studied indicated that this colony had grown from 18,000 birds in 1966-1968 to 54,500 birds in 1976. In 1976, geese nested on islands that were used in the late 1960''s and on an island and mainland sites that were previously unoccupied. Average nest density in 1976 was 3-fold greater than in the late 1960''s. Consequently, the average distance to nearest neighbors of Ross'' geese in 1976 was half the average distance determined 10 yr earlier. The mean clutch size of Ross'' geese was greater in island habitats where nest densities were high than in less populated island or mainland habitats. The average size of snow goose clutches did not differ significantly among island habitats but was larger at island than at mainland sites. Large clutches were most likely attributable to older and/or earlier nesting females. Habitat preferences apparently differed between species. Small clutches presumably indicated that young geese nested in areas where nest densities were low. The establishment of mainland nesting at Karrak Lake probably began with young snow geese using peripheral areas of the colony. Young Ross'' geese nested in sparsely populated habitats on islands to a greater extent than did snow geese. Ross'' geese also nested on the mainland but in lower densities than Ross'' geese nesting in similar island habitats. Successful nests with the larger clutches had closer conspecific neighbors than did successful nests with smaller clutches. The species composition of nearest neighbors changed significantly with distance from snow goose nests but not Ross'' goose nests. Nesting success was not affected by the species of nearest neighbor. Because they have complementary antipredator adaptations, Ross'' and snow geese may benefit by nesting together.																				1938-4254					1983	100	2					335	343		10.1093/auk/100.2.335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/100.2.335													WOS:A1983QX26300007
J	Majdic, G				Majdic, Gregor			ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS	SLOVENIAN VETERINARY RESEARCH												Endocrine disrupting chemical is a term for a wide range of chemicals that could affect development and/or function of endocrine system in animals. First reports about potential endocrine disrupting effects of certain chemicals in the environment were published almost twenty years ago, based on the reports about problems with sexual development/differentiation of certain wild animals living in heavily contaminated environments like certain lakes in Florida, US. Subsequent studies have shown potential endocrine disrupting effects for many different chemical substances, ranging from pesticides, plastics, pharmaceuticals and others, and currently there is no known structure/function relationship that would suggest whether certain chemical might have endocrine disrupting properties. However, almost all studies showing endocrine disrupting properties have been performed in vitro or with laboratory animals so there is no conclusive answer whether such chemicals might pose a threat for human and animal health in everyday life. Interesting, though, are observations that male reproductive health has detoriated in the last decades. There are several reports that incidence of hypospadias, cryptorchidism and testicular cancer has increased, although these reports with the exception of testicular cancer, are often disputed. Similarly, several reports suggest fall in semen quality in human males in the last several decades, although again, this reports are often disputed and since there are no large prospective studies, we do not have a conclusive answer whether there really are any adverse effects occurring with human reproductive health. If such reports are reflecting real situation and if endocrine disrupting chemicals are involved in the etiology of such problems, one would expect similar trends to be observed also in domestic animals, which are usually exposed to similar environment as humans. However, there are very few studies systematically and chronologically examining reproductive health of domestic animals. Two published studies examined bull semen quality and could not detect detoriating quality. However, bulls in breeding centers are selected for their reproductive performance and therefore do not represent a situation in the normal population.

J	Cheng, B; Chen, FH; Zhang, JW				Cheng Bo; Chen Fahu; Zhang Jiawu			Palaeovegetational and palaeoenvironmental changes since the last deglacial in Gonghe Basin, northeast Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Paleoenvironmental history in the monsoonal margin in the northeast Tibetan Plateau provides important clue to the regional climate. Previous researches have been limited by either poor chronology or low resolution. Here we present a high-resolution pollen record from a 40.92-m-long sediment core (DLH) taken from Dalianhai, a terminal lake situated in the Gonghe Basin, the northeast Tibetan Plateau for reconstructing the vegetation and climate history since the last deglacial on the basis of a chronology controlled by 10 AMS C-14 dates on plant remains preserved in the core sediments. The pollen assemblages in DLH core can be partitioned into 6 pollen zones and each zone is mainly characterized by the growth and decline of tree or herb pollen percentage. During the periods of 14.8-12.9 ka and 9.4-3.9 ka, the subalpine arboreal and local herbaceous pollen increased, indicating the subalpine forest developed in the surrounding mountains and a desert steppe or typical steppe developed in Gonghe Basin under a relatively moister climate. During the periods of 15.8-14.8 ka, 12.9-9.4 ka and 3.9-1.4 ka, the forest shrank or disappeared according to different degrees of aridity, and the desert steppe degraded to a more arid steppe desert in the basin, indicating a dry climate. After 1.4 ka, vegetation type around Dalianhai was mainly dominated by steppe suggested by increased Artemisia. Our results suggested the climate history in this region was dry from 15.8-14.8 ka, humid from 14.8-12.9 ka and dry from 12.9-9.4 ka, after which the climate was humid during 9.4-3.9 ka, followed by dry conditions during 3.9-1.4 ka and humid conditions in the last 1.4 ka. The change of pollen percentage and the evolution of palaeovegetation in Dalianhai since the last deglacial were similar to those recorded in Qinghai Lake. The forest expanded in the mountains around Dalianhai during the Bolling-Allerod period, shrank during the Younger Dryas and the early Holocene, then it developed and reached its maximum in the mid-Holocene. During the late Holocene, the vegetation began to shrink till disappearance. However, the timing of forest expansion in the Holocene lagged behind that of Qinghai Lake, and this spatial heterogeneity was probably caused by the different forest species between these two places. The maximum of forest development in the mid-Holocene was inconsistent with the period of stronger summer monsoon in the early Holocene indicated by stalagmite records, the reason might be related to the complexity of vegetation response to a large-scale climatic change.

Major reservoirs in the southeastern states regulate the basin's river systems for irrigation but also provide recreational fisheries. One of these storages is Lake Eppalock in the state of Victoria, a multi-use impoundment built in 1964 covering 3,230 ha and holding 312,000 ML at full supply level. It has been actively developed as a mixed species recreational fishery (golden perch Macquaria ambigua and Murray cod Maccullochella peeli) and is a Popular angling water. The principal recreational target species in the lake compete with invasive pest species (common carp [also known as European carp] Cyprinus carpio). Drought is part of the natural variability of the Australian climate and its rainfall history features several periods of a decade or longer that have been distinctly drought-prone. Eastern Australia was in the eighth year of the latest drought cycle in 2007, and Lake Eppalock had fallen to less than 1% of its full supply level. These conditions highlighted increasing competition for water and brought into focus the interdependence and linkages between fisheries management and water needs, both for irrigation and for the environment. Fisheries managers faced a very strong likelihood of extensive fish deaths in the lake and elsewhere that could cause significant long-term impacts requiring many years to recover the recreational fishery A planned partnership approach with the storage water authority was adopted in 2006 for integrated fisheries and water management, with response actions targeted to achieve storage conditions ensuring the maximum survivability of key recreational angling species in the lake through the drought. The framework for cooperation established in this study provides all example for future water allocation disputes.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						37	48																WOS:000263597300004

Using 30 a (climatology) moving averages and detrended standard deviations (mean variability change, MVC), moving linear trends, change points and wavelets, reconstructed temperatures were partitioned into a warmer (+0.3 degrees C; ca. 570-351 BC), cooler (-0.2 degrees C; ca. 350-16 BC) and moderate period (+0.1 degrees C; ca. 15 BC to AD 120) relative to the reconstruction average (10.9 degrees C; reference AD 1950-2000 = 9.8 degrees C). Warm and variable JJA temperatures at the Late Iron Age-Roman Period transition (approximately 50 BC to AD 100 in this region) and a cold anomaly around 470 BC (Early-Late Iron Age) were inferred. Inter-annual and decadal temperature variability was greater from ca. 570 BC to AD 120 than the last millennium, whereas multi-decadal and lower-frequency temperature variability were comparable, as evident in wavelet plots. Using MVC plots of reconstructed JJA temperatures from ca. 570 BC to AD 120, we verified current trends and European climate model outputs for the 21st century, which suggest increased inter-annual summer temperature variability and extremes in a generally warmer climate (heteroscedasticity; hotspot of variability). We compared these results to MVC plots of instrumental and reconstructed temperatures (from the same sediment core and proxies but a different study) from AD 1177 to AD 2000. Our reconstructed JJA temperatures from ca. 570 BC to AD 120 showed that inter-annual JJA temperature variability increased rapidly above a threshold of similar to 10 degrees C mean JJA temperature. This increase accelerated with continued warming up >11.5 degrees C. We suggest that the Roman Period serves with respect to inter-annual variability as an analogue for warmer 21st-century JJA temperatures in the Alps.

The three pollen records can be correlated on the basis of three radiocarbon-dated horizons (> 39 900 yr BP, 34 850 yr BP and 1390 yr BP) and palynostratigraphy. Pollen concentration data provide indirect time control between radiocarbon-dated horizons of the La Chonta 2 core. During the Early Glacial successive fluctuations of the upper forest line occurred between ca. 2300 m and 2800 m altitude and the bog is alternately situated close to the subalpine rainforest belt and in the uppermontane rainforest belt. During the Pleniglacial (ca. 50 000-13 000 yr BP) the forest line fell to ca. 2000 m altitude and paramo vegetation surrounded the La Chonta site. During the Late Glacial the forest line shifted rapidly in ca. 270 yr to 2700-2800 m altitude and the lake became surrounded by Quercus-dominated upper montane rainforest during a period of ca. 1655 yr. A distinct climate cooling (by 2-2.5-degrees-C) followed during ca. 580 yr and the upper forest line dropped to ca. 2400 m altitude. This temperature rebound is probably equivalent to the Younger Dryas event. In the depression extensive Alnus carr and swamp vegetation developed. Finally, during the Holocene, the forest line shifted to 3300-3500 m elevation and the lower montane rainforest reached close to ca. 2300 m altitude. In the later part of the Holocene subparamo scrub with Hypericum, Puya, Compositae, Escallonia and Ericaceae largely replaced Alnus carr and the regional and local vegetation closely resembles the present-day composition. During the Last Glacial to Holocene transition a shift of the upper forest line of ca. 1400 m is inferred, corresponding to a glacial temperature depression at 2300 m altitude of ca. 8-degrees-C.																			0267-8179					SEP	1992	7	3					205	225		10.1002/jqs.3390070303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390070303													WOS:A1992JY48300002
J	Choinski, A; Denega, W; Macias, A; Piniarski, W				Choinski, Adam; Denega, Wojciech; Macias, Andrzej; Piniarski, Witold			Examples and effects of avalanches on the surface of mountain lakes: Morskie Oko, a case study from Poland (Tatra Mountains)	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												This study represents a pioneering effort to analyze the impact of avalanches descending into Morskie Oko from Marchwiczny Gully, the most active avalanche path around the lake. It focuses on catastrophic avalanches that descended from the analyzed gully, as reported in the literature from the 1900s until now. However, only the data collected in recent years, our field studies, combined with modern LIDAR data and GIS-based modeling, allowed us to perform a detailed analysis. The GIS-based approach effectively uses spatial data to address snow avalanche modeling challenges. Although the study area lies within Tatra National Park, no official services carry out systematic avalanche monitoring or measurements. The impact of hazardous events, such as snow avalanches, on the most famous Polish mountain lake, Morskie Oko, has been poorly described in the literature and has yet to be discovered. Therefore, to analyze the selected avalanche parameters, we mainly used our ground and additional aerial photographs taken by local mountain services and related field measurements. Our analysis resulted in figurative estimates of the extent and volume of avalanche snow and its weight, both on the surface of the ice sheet and the part of the avalanche that did not reach the lake's shore and remained on the slope of Marchwiczny Gully. For example, the values for the mighty avalanche on February 3, 2023, are 23,500 m3 and 4,700 tons on the ice surface and 20,000 m3 and 4,000 tons on the slope. It was determined that avalanches that descend onto the studied lake's surface result in its shallowing. This process occurs because of sedimentation of slope material carried by avalanches, especially during the final phase of ice cover melting. When openings appear in the solid ice cover in spring, floating ice can migrate, driven by wind pressure, and deposit avalanche material in various parts of the lake bottom. Thus, avalanches contributed to the gradual disappearance of the lake.

In this study, we conducted major and trace element analyses on 86 lacustrine samples from the X5 core in Beijing to determine their origin and provenance. The results indicate that their abundances all varied in relatively narrow ranges, similar to those of the samples in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). A high correlation of major and trace element abundances exists between our lacustrine samples and the CLP samples. UCC-normalized major and trace element abundances also have a similar pattern between the lacustrine and the CLP samples, with the exception of a few elements with high solubility, such as Mg. In the ternary diagrams of A-CN-K, La-Th-Sc and Zr/10-Th-Sc, and the correlation maps of major/trace elements and their ratios, four groups of the X5 lacustrine samples with different sedimentation stages (3.16-2.7 Ma, 2.7-1.8 Ma, 1.8-0.9 Ma and 0.9-0 Ma) overlap well with each other and with the CLP samples, indicating that the X5 lacustrine samples are likely of windblown origin and possibly shared common, unchanged dust source regions with the CLP since the Late Pliocene. This interpretation is supported by the overlap of the lacustrine samples from Beijing with the CLP samples in the correlation maps of Ms vs. sorting, Ms vs. skewness, Ms vs. kurtosis, and kurtosis vs. skewness. Analysis of the frequency and cumulative frequency curves indicates that the X5 lacustrine sediments were dominantly transported by the winter monsoon and the westerly circulation. Given more scattered distributions of different elemental ratios and grain size parameters of the X5 core lacustrine sediments compared to those of the CLP samples, local dust particles must have contributed occasionally, which deserves further investigation in the future. Several chemical ratios, such as Rb/Sr, Na2O/Al2O3, CaO/Al2O3, and chemical index of alteration (CIA), were calculated for the lacustrine samples in Beijing. Comparison of these ratios' variations with those of the sea level of the South China Sea and the global benthic delta O-18 record indicates that Na2O/Al2O3 and CIA can be regarded as sensitive indicators of chemical weathering of lacustrine dust sediments in the mid-latitudes of Northern Hemisphere.

J	Trajkovski, D; Apostolova, N				Trajkovski, Dejan; Apostolova, Nadezda			The Catastrophic Water Loss of Ancient Lake Prespa: A Chronicle of a Death Foretold	HYDROLOGY												The Prespa-Ohrid lake system in the southwest Balkan region is the oldest permanent lake system in Europe and a global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism. Its smaller component, Lake Macro Prespa (or simply called Prespa), shared by North Macedonia, Albania and Greece has suffered a dramatic water-level fall (nearly 10 m since the 1950s). It was greater in the periods 1987-1993 and 1998-2004 and has further accelerated in the last 5 years. Analysis of satellite images (remote sensing) revealed that over the period 1984-2020 Prespa Lake lost 18.87 km2 of its surface (6.9% of its size, dropping from 273.38 km2 to 254.51 km2), with a decline in the volume of water estimated as about 54%, even reaching 56.8% in 2022. The environmental status of the lake has also been compromised and the process of its eutrophication is enhanced. The aim of this study is to summarize the current understanding of the diminishing trend in the water level and the factors that have contributed to it. The lake is highly sensitive to external impacts, including climate change, mainly restricted precipitation and increased water abstraction for irrigation. Importantly, nearly half of its outflow is through karst aquifers that feed Ohrid Lake. Of note, the hydrology and especially hydrogeology of the catchment has not been studied in sufficient detail and accurate data for the present state are missing, largely due to a lack of coordinated investigations by the three neighboring countries. However, recent estimation of the water balance of Prespa Lake, elaborated with the consideration of only the natural sources of inflow (precipitation and river runoff) and outflow (evaporation and loss of water through the karst channels) suggested a negative balance of 53 x 106 m3 annually. Our study also offers an estimated projection for the water level in the future in different climate scenarios based on linear regression models that predict its complete loss before the end of the present century.

Coastal brackish lakes are particularly difficult to manage due to complex nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity dynamics that may exert varying influence on lake biological communities, but long-term data on how these important and often biodiverse systems respond to change are rare. In this study, palaeolimnological data (including sedimentary parameters, diatoms, and plant macrofossils) and environmental monitoring data (for the last similar to 40 years) have been used to assess environmental change over the last 100 years in Kilen, a brackish lake in northwest Jutland, Denmark. Kilen has been regularly monitored for salinity (since 1972), TP (from 1975), TN (from 1976), and since 1989 for biological data (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrophytes), which allows a robust comparison of contemporary and paleolimnological data at high temporal resolution. The palaeolimnological data indicate that the lake has been nutrient rich for the last 100 years, with eutrophication peaking from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Reduced nutrient concentrations have occurred since the late 1990s, though this is not reflected in the sediment core diatom assemblage, highlighting that caution must be taken when using quantitative data from biological transfer functions in paleolimnology. Lake recovery over the last 20 years has been driven by a reduction in TN and TP loading from the catchment and shows improvements in the lake water clarity and, recently, in macrophyte cover. Reduced salinity after 2004 has also changed the composition of the dominant macrophyte community within the lake. The low N:P ratio indicates that in summer, the lake is predominately N-limited, likely explaining why previous management, mainly focusing on TP reduction measures, had a modest effect on the water quality of the lake. Despite a slight recovery, the lake is still nutrient-rich, and future management of this system must continue to reduce the nutrient loads of both TN and TP to ensure sustained recovery. This study provides an exceptional opportunity to validate the palaeolimnological record with monitoring data and demonstrates the power of using this combined approach in understanding environmental change in these key aquatic ecosystems.

The investigated drill core succession shows a general evolution from red-brown claystones to white-grey marlstones and microcrystalline limestones, which all have previously been considered as relict deposits of an impact ejecta-dammed lake, falling within the mid-Miocene Climate Transition. However, recent mammal biostratigraphic dating suggests a likely pre-impact age. Indeed, no pebbles from impact ejecta have been detected; only local clasts of Mesozoic formations, in addition to rare Palaeozoic lydites from outside of the study area. Lithofacies analysis demonstrates only the absence of lacustrine criteria, except for one charophyte-bearing mudstone. Instead, the succession is characterized by less diagnostic floodplain fines with palaeosols, palustrine limestones with root voids and intercalated thin sandstone beds. Carbonate isotope signatures of the mottled marlstones, palustrine limestones and mud-supported conglomerates substantiate the interpretation of a fluvial setting. Low, invariant delta O-18(carb) reflects a short water residence time and highly variable delta C-13(carb) indicates a variable degree of pedogenesis. Carbonate Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the entire succession show a unidirectional trend from 0.7103 to 0.7112, indicating a change of the solute provenance from Triassic to Jurassic rocks, identical to the provenance trend from extraclasts. The increase in carbonate along the succession is therefore independent from climate changes but reflects a base-level rise from the level of the siliciclastic Upper Triassic to the carbonate-bearing Lower to Middle Jurassic bedrocks. This study demonstrates that, when information on sedimentary architecture is limited, a combination of facies criteria (i.e. presence or absence of specific sedimentary structures and diagnostic organisms), component provenance, and stable and radiogenic isotopes is required to unequivocally distinguish between lacustrine and fluvial sediments, and to disentangle regional geological effects in the catchment and climate influences.

Facility for testing ice drills	SCIENTIFIC DRILLING												The Rapid Access Ice Drill (RAID) is designed for subsurface scientific investigations in Antarctica. Its objectives are to drill rapidly through ice, to core samples of the transition zone and bedrock, and to leave behind a borehole observatory. These objectives required the engineering and fabrication of an entirely new drilling system that included a modified mining-style coring rig, a unique fluid circulation system, a rod skid, a power unit, and a workshop with areas for the storage of supplies and consumables. An important milestone in fabrication of the RAID was the construction of a North American Test (NAT) facility where we were able to test drilling and fluid processing functions in an environment that is as close as possible to that expected in Antarctica. Our criteria for site selection was that the area should be cold during the winter months, be located in an area of low heat flow, and be at relatively high elevation. We selected a site for the facility near Bear Lake, Utah, USA. The general design of the NAT well (NAT-1) started with a 27.3 cm (10.75 in.) outer casing cemented in a 152 m deep hole. Within that casing, we hung a 14 cm (5.5 in.) casing string, and, within that casing, a column of ice was formed. The annulus between the 14 and 27.3 cm casings provided the path for circulation of a refrigerant. After in-depth study, we chose to use liquid CO2 to cool the hole. In order to minimize the likelihood of the casing splitting due to the volume increase associated with freezing water, the hole was first cooled and then ice was formed in increments from the bottom upward. First, ice cubes were placed in the inner liner and then water was added. Using this method, a column of ice was incrementally prepared for drilling tests. The drilling tests successfully demonstrated the functioning of the RAID system. Reproducing such a facility for testing of other ice drilling systems could be advantageous to other research programs in the future.					; Goodge, John/GQI-3878-2022	Severinghaus, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8883-3119; Goodge, John/0000-0003-2578-3147													1816-8957	1816-3459				MAY 31	2017	22						29	33		10.5194/sd-22-29-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/sd-22-29-2017													WOS:000402425700003

Prior to this, the lake's planktivore community was dominated by kokanee (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon) and an invasive freshwater shrimp Mysis diluviana, and British Columbia fisheries managers were concerned that reintroduced Sockeye Salmon fry might reduce the abundance of zooplankton prey and negatively affect the abundance and size of kokanee available for the recreational fishery. We looked for possible adverse effects by introducing contrasting densities (0-2,309 fish/ha) of marked, hatchery-origin Sockeye Salmon fry to Skaha Lake over 12 years (2005-2017). During each year, we monitored state change indicators of lake flushing, water temperature, nutrients, phytoplankton, microzooplankton, M. diluviana, kokanee, and Sockeye Salmon. Zooplankton consumption by Sockeye Salmon, kokanee, and M. diluviana was estimated via bioenergetics models. We found that (1) average densities of pelagic fish gradually increased above premanipulation densities and (2) survival (egg to winter) of kokanee fry was variable but positively associated with increased abundances of Sockeye Salmon fry. Average survival of age-0 to age-3+ kokanee in Skaha Lake exhibited no significant trends. We also found that (3) growth rates for age-0 Sockeye Salmon fry and kokanee were stable during 2005-2013, despite moderate increases in fish abundance, but declined in 2017. This decline was associated with record-high biomasses of kokanee and M. diluviana, record rates of zooplankton loss from predation and lake flushing, and reduced zooplankton production. We found that (4) bioenergetics data showed that, on average, 1.8% of annual zooplankton prey consumption was attributable to hatchery-origin Sockeye Salmon fry, 2.8% to Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis, 13.9% to older kokanee, and 79.6% of the zooplankton was consumed by M. diluviana. We concluded that during 2005-2015 consumption by planktivores never exceeded production by zooplankton, but in 2017, when lake flushing rates were exceptionally high, consumption by planktivores exceeded lake-carrying capacity for pelagic fish. Sockeye Salmon fry played virtually no part in these events.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41	5					1246	1273		10.1002/nafm.10635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10635		AUG 2021											WOS:000688433200001
J	Hulsmann, S; Mehner, T				Hulsmann, S; Mehner, T			Predation by underyearling perch (Perca fluviatilis) on a Daphnia galeata population in a short-term enclosure experiment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The predation impact of underyearling perch (20 mm total length) on the dynamics of Daphnia galeata was studied in three 6.5-m(3) enclosures during a 17-day experiment in June 1995. These data were compared with zooplankton succession in three fish-free control enclosures and in the pelagic zone of Bautzen reservoir, Germany. 2. Due to individual growth during the experiment, fish biomass in the enclosures increased from 210 mg wet body mass (w.b.m.) m(-3) to 830 mg wb.m. m(-3), equivalent to an increase from 20 kg ha(-1) to 75 kg ha(-1). 3. In the enclosures with fish, biomass of daphnids decreased steadily to values below 1 mg wet weight (w.w.) l(-1) within 17 days, whereas in the fish-free controls and in Bautzen reservoir the Daphnia biomass fluctuated around 8 mg ww. l(-1). Other zooplankton species exhibited little or no change. Approximately 60 kg ha(-1) was calculated as the critical underyearling perch biomass which may induce a drastic decline of the Daphnia galeata population in Bautzen reservoir. Comparison with values from other lakes is difficult due to differences in water depths and Daphnia biomasses. 4. Mean individual biomass of daphnids, egg ratio and proportion of adult daphnids were significantly lower in the enclosures with fish compared with the control enclosures at the end of the experiment. This may be explained partly by preferential predation of the large, egg-carrying daphnids by fish. However, no difference was found in clutch size and size at first reproduction, possibly due to the short duration of the experiment. 5. It must be assumed that the 'summer depression' of daphnids observed in many waters is not the exclusive effect of direct reduction of daphnids by fish predation. Even the high biomass of underyearling perch stocked in the enclosures did not completely account for Daphnia mortality. Instead, the selective loss of large size classes, combined with low food resources and reduced reproduction rates, may induce the marked declines in daphnids.

Diatom-inferred centennial-millennial postglacial climate change in the Pacific Northwest of North America	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A diatom record from Moss Lake, Washington, USA spans the last 14,500 cal year and revealed Holocene climate change in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), including evidence for periodicities related to ocean-atmosphere teleconnections and/or variations in solar output. Three main climate phases were identified: (i) Late Pleistocene to early Greenlandian (until 10,800 cal year BP, spanning GI-1, GS-1), with a cold climate and low diatom abundance; (ii) early Greenlandian to Northgrippian (10,800-7500 cal year BP), shifting to a warmer climate; and (iii) late Northgrippian and Meghalayan from 7500 cal year BP onwards, with a cooler, moist climate. These climate shifts are in good agreement with the pollen record from the same core and other regional studies. Fluctuations in Discostella pseudostelligera and Aulacoseira taxa suggest climate cycles of different frequency and amplitude throughout the record. Spectral and wavelet analyses revealed periodicities of approximately 1400 and 400-500 years. We interpret the similar to 1400-year and similar to 400-500-year cycles to reflect alternating periods of enhanced (and reduced) convective mixing in the water column, associated with increased (and decreased) storms, resulting from ocean-atmosphere teleconnections in the wider Pacific region. The similar to 1400-year periodicity is evident throughout the Late Pleistocene and late Northgrippian/Meghalayan, reflecting high-amplitude millennial shifts from periods of stable thermal stratification of the water column (weak wind intensity) to periods of convective mixing (high wind intensity). The millennial cycle diminishes during the Greenlandian, in association with the boreal summer insolation maximum, consistent with suppression of ENSO-like dynamics by enhanced trade winds. Ocean-atmosphere teleconnection suppression is recorded throughout the PNW, but there is a time discrepancy with other records, some that reveal suppression during the Greenlandian and others during the Northgrippian, suggesting endogenic processes may also modulate the Moss Lake diatom record. The large amplitude of millennial variability indicated by the lake data suggests that regional climate in the PNW was characterised over the longer term by shifting influences of ocean-atmosphere dynamics and that an improved understanding of the external forcing is necessary for understanding past and future climate conditions in western North America.

Impact of new mouth opening on morphology and water quality of the Chilika Lagoon - a study based on Resourcesat-1 LISS-III and AWiFS and IRS-1D LISS-III data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The northeasterly long shore transport ( littoral drift) along the east coast of India shifts the mouth of the lagoon northeastwards. It results in lengthening of the outer channel, reduced tidal flux, fall in salinity levels, weed infestation, decline in fishery resources, and overall loss of biodiversity and productivity. The Chilika Development Authority made an artificial mouth near the village of Sipakuda, which was opened on 23 September 2000. The present study focuses on applications of Resourcesat-1 LISS-III and AWiFS data to understand the impact of the new mouth opening on the morphology and water quality of the Chilika Lagoon. Digital image processing of multi-temporal Resourcesat-1 AWiFS, LISS-III, and IRS-1D LISS-III data was carried out. Changes were shown out for pre- and post-opening of the new mouth. The results indicate that the initial cut of 80m has widened to approximately 676m and, so far, the process has not attained stability. There has been northward erosion for approximately 376m and southward erosion for approximately 143m at the new mouth. The study shows that the strong ebbing tide current from the northwest is responsible for this erosion. The old mouth has been closed completely just three years after the opening of the new mouth. There has been an overall rise in salinity levels in the Chilika Lagoon, in particular during the pre-monsoon period following the opening of the new mouth. This indicates that the tidal flux in the lagoon has increased and the associated circulation is effective in mixing the water masses. After the opening of the new mouth, weeds have reduced by a 172-km(2) area, in particular in the northeast part of the lagoon. AWiFS data is extremely useful in identifying changes in morphology and water quality under different tide conditions. Tidal conditions influence the signatures of turbidity, weed cover, shoals, and spits under development. The SWIR channel of AWiFS is found to be extremely useful for detecting aquatic vegetation. The study concludes that large transport of sediments at the new mouth opening, along with predominant erosion of the northern bank, suggests a northward migration of the new mouth in the near future.

J	Gulyás, S; Sümegi, P				Gulyas, Sandor; Sumegi, Pal			Coordinated response of endemic gastropods to Late Glacial and Holocene climate-driven paleohydrological changes in a small thermal pond of Central Europe	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The thermal spring-fed Lake Petea located in NW Romania southeast of the city of Oradea harbors a unique endemic warm water biota. It is the only location in Europe where thermal water endemic melanopsid Microcolpia parreyssii (Philippi, 1847) lived along with the highly endangered warm-water relict neritid Theodoxus prevostianus. Lake Petea's evolution was mainly controlled by major climate-driven hydrological changes also seen in regional records. The hydrological changes were mainly controlled by varying input of thermal water due to recurring increased/decreased recharge of the underground karst water system. The driving factor was warming connected to the interstadial GI 1 increasing recharge by melting of regional ice sheets in the Late Glacial. Conversely, during the Younger Dryas (H0) and the Holocene increasing/decreasing moisture availability was in control. Low stands created multiple bottlenecks reducing genetic variability seen in the appearance of extreme morphologies during next rapid climate melioration. The studied gastropods responded mostly similarly to changes controlling the availability of elements in shell construction and habitat reduction leading to changes in shape, density, size. Periods of lower lake levels and reduced warm water input are characterized by the emergence of elongated tightly coiled shells while globular, compressed loosely coiled shells develop at times of warmer water provision and increased Mg availability. In size there is a contrasting trend. Namely globose Th. prevostianus shells are larger than the elongated ones. Conversely globose, compressed Microcolpia are generally smaller than their elongated spindle-shaped counterparts. In this sense the development of dwarf morphotypes in warmer water habitats is characteristic of Lake Petea melanopsids. This type of dwarfism i.e. the reduction of shell size is lacking though in Lake Petea neritids. Our findings also confirm the presence of various ecophenotypes of Microcolpia in the pond degrading our endemic species Mi. parreyssii to a variety of Mi. daudebartii.																			2045-2322					APR 24	2024	14	1							9419	10.1038/s41598-024-60185-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-60185-5								38658697					WOS:001207900600074

Yet, there is a poor understanding how anaerobic microbial processes regulate the cycling of elements in the concretions. The objective of this study was to highlight how the microbial processes control the release of elements from the concretions to brackish water during anoxia. Spherical concretions were collected from the oxic bottoms of the Gulf of Finland in the summer. Concretions and autoclaved controls were incubated in anoxic artificial brackish seawater with and without labile carbon, plus supplied with ammonium at 5, 10, and 20 A degrees C for 15 weeks. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, P, and As were measured from the intact concretions and the ambient solutions during the experiment. Also, the consumption of the added ammonium and organic carbon and the formation of dissolved inorganic carbon were measured. At near-bottom temperature 5 A degrees C, the concretions released at highest 0.12, 0.42, 0.02, and 0.0002 mu mol g(-1) day(-1) of Fe, Mn, P, and As, respectively. The rates were significant only in the microcosms with added labile carbon, and only minor proportions (0.1-0.4 %) of their total contents were released during the incubations. The concretions removed completely the supplied ammonium only without carbon addition. We find that concretion deposit may form a local hot spot for the microbial reduction of Fe and Mn and release significant amounts of P and As, and participate in N cycling besides the bottom sediments of the Gulf of Finland during prolonged anoxia. However, the concretions may maintain their binding capacity for P and As longer than the fine-grained organic-rich sediment during anoxia. During anoxia concretion deposits may form a temporal source of bioavailable P having ecological significance in the Gulf of Finland when concretions have access to labile organic carbon. Concretions from the Baltic Sea, the oceans, lakes, and soils contain high concentrations of Mn and Fe, but their proportions vary considerably. Anaerobic microbial processes may thus affect the stability of concretions from the different environments, but the outcome may depend on the ambient geochemical conditions.

In this study, tailings from Hg mines located in different geologic settings-New Idria (NI), a Si-carbonate Hg deposit, and Sulphur Bank (SB), a hot-spring Hg deposit-were characterized, and particle release from these wastes was studied in column experiments to (1) investigate the mechanisms of Hg release from NI and SB mine wastes, (2) determine the speciation of particle-bound Hg released from the mine wastes, and (3) determine the effect of calcinations on Hg release processes. The physical and chemical properties of tailings and the colloids released from them were determined using chemical analyses, selective chemical extractions, XRD, SEM, TEM, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques. The total Hg concentration in tailings increased with decreasing particle size in NI and SB calcines (roasted ore), but reached a maximum at an intermediate particle size in the SB waste rock (unroasted ore). Hg in the tailings exists predominantly as low-solubility HgS (cinnabar and metacinnabar), with NI calcines having >50% HgS, SB calcines having >89% HgS, and SB waste rock having similar to100% HgS. Leaching experiments with a high-ionic-strength solution (0.1 M NaCl) resulted in a rapid but brief release of soluble and particulate Hg. Lowering the ionic strength of the leach solution (0.005 M NaCl) resulted in the release of colloidal Hg from two of the three mine wastes studied (NI calcines and SB waste rock). Colloid-associated Hg accounts for as much as 95% of the Hg released during episodic particle release. Colloids generated from the NI calcines are produced by a breakup and release mechanism and consist of hematite, jarosite/alunite, and Al-Si gel with particle sizes of 10-200 nm. ATEM and XAFS analyses indicate that the majority (similar to78%) of the mercury is present in the form of HgS. SB calcines also produced HgS colloids. The colloids generated from the SB waste rock were heterogeneous and varied in composition according to the column influent composition. ATEM and XAFS results indicate that Hg is entirely in the HgS form. Data from this study identify colloidal HgS as the dominant transported form of Hg from these mine waste materials.

Subsequently, the project was expanded to include Denmark, Russian Kola, Russian Karelia, Scotland and Wales. The survey covers a geographic area of ca. 1 300 000 km(2); this is about 13% of Europe's total area and 28% of Europe excluding European Russia. The total number of lakes (> 0.04 km(2)) in the study area is about 155 000 and of these 5690 lakes (3.7%) were sampled in this survey. This is 3.7% of the total lake population (> 0.04 km(2)). The lake density is about 1 lake per 9 km(2), and the sampling density is 1 lake per 244 km(2). The first common evaluation of lake chemistry in northern Europe showed that the chemistry of these lakes, except those in Denmark, are characterized by low ionic strength (dilute) waters, with low concentrations of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. There are general differences in the lake water chemistry between the countries, due to differences in hydrology, precipitation chemistry, hydrology, soil cover and vegetation. From western Norway, Scotland and Wales to eastern Finland and Karelia, there is a gradient from high to low precipitation (5000 to 300 mm yr(-1)) and from mountain areas with thin and patchy soils to forested areas with thick soils. These two factors are reflected in lake water chemistry with low concentrations of base cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K), alkalinity (HCO(3)(-)) and total organic carbon (TOC) in the western areas to higher concentrations in the eastern areas. An exception is high TOC levels in lakes in Scotland and Wales. Median values for base cation concentrations are three times higher in Sweden, Finland, Scotland, and Wales than in Norway, and TOC concentrations vary even more. The lakes in Denmark are influenced by a different bedrock mineralogy than in the other countries, and agricultural activities are much more intensive in their catchments. The Danish lakes generally have much higher ion concentrations and high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. In Finland, Norway, Sweden, Russian Kola and Karelia, more than 50% of the lakes have low critical load (CL) values for sulfur acidity (CL < 60 meg m(-2) yr(-1)) while Scotland, Wales, and Denmark have very few lakes with low CL. The highest percentage (27%) of lakes with exceedance of critical loads for sulfur acidity (at present S-loading) is found in Norway. In Russian Kola, Sweden and Finland 17%, 9% and 9%, respectively, of the lakes are exceeded. In Scotland, critical loads for sulfur acidity are exceeded in only 1% of the total lake population, while 24% of Welsh lakes are exceeded. In total, this adds up to approximately 22 000 lakes, corresponding to 14% of the total lake population in northern Europe, where CL for sulfur acidity is exceeded.					; Fjeld, Eirik/K-9241-2013; Curtis, Christopher/A-1768-2013; Moiseenko, Tatyana/A-5014-2017; Curtis, Chris/A-1768-2013	Fjeld, Eirik/0000-0003-0137-6918; Moiseenko, Tatyana/0000-0003-2875-1693; Curtis, Chris/0000-0002-6597-2172													0044-7447					MAR	1998	27	2					80	91																WOS:000073847800002

Effect of a cyanobacterial diet on the competition between rotifers: a case study in Lake Albufera of Valencia, Spain	LIMNETICA												Brachionus havanaensis is predominantly distributed in the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. It is now found even in the Palearctic and Oriental regions. During the summer of 2015 we found high densities (> 500 ind./l) of this species and low numbers of Brachionus angularis in Lake Albufera where the cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) was dominant in the phytoplankton community. We hypothesized that the cyanobacterium was toxic to B. angularis but not to B. havanaensis hence the latter would outcompete the former in the presence of this cyanobacterium. To test the hypothesis, we conducted competition experiments between two coexisting rotifer species (B. angularis and B. havanaensis) from the Lake Albufera of Valencia using as food the green alga (Nannochloropsis oculata) and sonicated colonies of M. aeruginosa (single cells), separately and together (1:1 ratio based on biomass). The competition experiments using the population growth approach showed that B. havanaensis in controls had higher population abundances than B. angularis. However, when grown both together, B. havanaensis had a reduced population growth (nearly 50 %) in relation to B. angularis, in the absence ofMicrocystis in the diet. This reduced growth was more than that in the treatment of B. havanaensis alone when grown on a mixed diet of Microcystis and Nannochloropsis oculata. Brachionus havanaensis in all treatments (alone or in the presence of B. angularis) died completely when cultured on 100 % M. aeruginosa. The population growth rates of B. angularis, alone or in competition with B. havanaensis, were similar when Microcystis was excluded from the diet. However, Microcystis alone or together with Nannochloropsis was highly detrimental for the population growth of B. angularis. Our results showed the differences in the competitive outcome between the rotifers depending on the presence or absence of toxic cyanobacteria in the diet. Our study also showed that an exclusive diet of this cyanobacterium was toxic to both rotifers.					; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2019	38	1					279	289		10.23818/limn.38.20	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.38.20													WOS:000457181700017
J	MCCOLL, RHS				MCCOLL, RHS			CHEMISTRY OF SEDIMENTS IN RELATION TO TROPHIC CONDITION OF 8 ROTORUA LAKES	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Chemical parameters (pH, Eh [redox potential], C, Kjeldahl N, total P, 0.5 M, H2SO4-extractable P, organic P, and water-soluble P) were measured in the surface layers of sediments collected from various depths in Lakes Rotowhero, Okaro, Ngapouri, Rotokakahi, Okareka, Tikitapu, Okataina and Rotoma [New Zealand] during Oct., 1972. The sediments of the productive geothermal lake, Rotowhero, were markedly different from those of the cold-water lakes, probably as a result of enrichment by hot springs. The mean concentrations in the sediments of the cold-water lakes were C, 3.2-7.9%; Kjeldahl N, 3380-8310 .mu.g.cntdot.g-1; and P, 690-1780 .mu.g.cntdot.g-1. These concentrations are within the ranges for New Zealand terrestrial topsoils, but the lake sediments appear enriched in P relative to local topsoils. Total C, N and P concentrations of sediments tended to be highest in the eutrophic lakes (Okaro, Ngapouri), although the deep oligotrophic lakes (Okataina, Rotoma) had relatively high total P concentrations. The C, N and P concentrations of the sediments showed little relationship to the trophic state of the lake. Organic P concentrations of the surface layers of sediments were similar in all cold-water lakes. The proportion of the total P apparently fixed in mineral material was minimal (0-1%) in sediments from the eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes, but in the oligotrophic lakes was similar to that in New Zealand topsoils (9-14%). Reducing conditions may cause solution of a high proportion of the fixed P in the eutrophic lakes. The water-soluble P concentrations in the sediments of the 5 shallow cold-water lakes (Okaro, Ngapouri, Rotokakahi, Okareka, Tikitapu) correlated positively with trophic state and with concentrations of dissolved P in the lake waters. C, N and P concentrations in the sediments tended to vary with overlying water depth.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1977	11	3					509	523		10.1080/00288330.1977.9515692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1977.9515692													WOS:A1977FJ10000007
J	Soengkono, S				Soengkono, S			Interpretation of magnetic anomalies over the Waimangu geothermal area, Taupo volcanic zone, New Zealand	GEOTHERMICS												The study area is located on the eastern side of the Taupo volcanic zone in central North Island of New Zealand. It lies a few kilometres to the southwest of Mt Tarawera, the site of the biggest New Zealand volcanic eruption in historical times (the June 1886 Tarawera eruption). The study area includes the Waimangu geothermal field and a small part of Waiotapu and Waikite fields. The extensive surface thermal expressions (boiling springs, hot lakes, craters, and sinter terraces) occurring at the Waimangu field were all formed following the 1886 Tarawera eruption. Another large area of less intense thermal manifestations (thermal ground and hydrothermally altered rocks) exists about 5 km southwest of Waimangu, extending towards the Waiotapu field in the south. In 1993 an aeromagnetic survey was conducted over the study area at an average altitude of about 350 m above the ground. The results show a subdued negative residual anomaly (about -100 nT) over the Waimangu field, which can be interpreted by near-surface hydrothermal demagnetisation of rhyolitic host rocks. The lateral distribution of the demagnetised rocks is much greater than the thermal area of Waimangu, and is consistent with the extent of low resistivity rocks across the study area. The magnetic interpretation also shows that two-high standing dacite domes situated about 5 and 7 km to the southwest of Waimangu have been affected by hydrothermal demagnetisation. There are negative residual anomalies outside the low resistivity zone that could be associated with reversely magnetised rocks (age > 0.78 Ma). A strong positive residual anomaly (up to 450 nT) occurs to the east of the Waimangu field. Results from 3-D magnetic interpretation indicate some alternative models for this positive anomaly: (1) southwest-northeast trending, vertical basalt dykes (magnetisation 10 A/m), tops between -0.1 and -0.65 km RL (reduced level = relative to sea level), (2) a thick (greater than or equal to 1 km) sequence of rhyolites (magnetisation 2.5 A/m).																			0375-6505	1879-3576				AUG	2001	30	4					443	459		10.1016/S0375-6505(00)00058-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-6505(00)00058-4													WOS:000169328000003

Tulomozerskaya Formation, Russian Karelia, is composed of an 800 m-thick magnesite-stromatolite-dolostone-'red bed' succession with the most C-13-rich dolostones (up to +18 parts per thousand V-PDB) that have ever been reported. Terrigenous 'red beds' are developed throughout the sequence and represent three main depositional settings: (1) a braided fluvial system over a lower energy, river-dominated coastal plain, (2) a low-energy, barred lagoon or bight, and (3) a non-marine, playa lake. A significant component of the sequence consists of biostromal and biohermal columnar stromatolites accreted in shallow-water, low-energy, intertidal zones, barred evaporitic lagoons and peritidal evaporitic environments. Only a small portion of stromatolites might have been accreted in relatively 'open' marine environments. The red, flat-laminated, dolomitic and magnesite stromatolites formed in evaporative ephemeral ponds, coastal sabkhas and playa lakes. Tepees, mudcracks, pseudomorphs after calcium sulphate, halite casts, and abundant 'red beds' in the sequence suggest that (1) terrestrial environments dominated over aqueous, and (2) partial or total decoupling took place between the stromatolite-dominated depositional systems and the bordering sea. The greatest enrichment in C-13 occurs in the playa magnesite (up to +17.2 parts per thousand) and in the laminated dolomitic stromatolites accreted in ephemeral ponds (up to +16.8 parts per thousand), whereas the dolostones from more open environments are less rich in C-13 (+5.6 to +10.7 parts per thousand). The isotopic shift (ca. 5 parts per thousand) induced by global factors (i.e. accelerated accumulation of organic material in an external basin) was augmented by that driven by a series of local factors (restriction, evaporation, biological photosynthesis). The latter enhanced a global delta(13)C value due to an isotopic disequilibrium between atmospheric CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon in the local aquatic reservoirs precipitating the carbonate minerals. The interplay between global and local factors should be taken into account when interpreting the Palaeoproterozoic carbon isotope excursion and its implications.

J	Black, GJ; Campbell, DB; Carter, LM				Black, G. J.; Campbell, D. B.; Carter, L. M.			Ground-based radar observations of Titan: 2000-2008	ICARUS												We have observed Titan with the Arecibo Observatory's 12.6 cm wavelength radar system during the last eight oppositions of the Saturn system with sufficient sensitivity to characterize its scattering properties as a function of sub-Earth longitude. In a few sessions the Green Bank Telescope was used as the receiving instrument in a bistatic configuration to boost sub-radar track length and integration time. Radar echo spectra have been obtained for a total of 92 viewing geometries with sub-Earth locations scattered through all longitudes and at latitudes between 7.6 degrees S and 26.3 degrees S, close to the maximum southern excursion of the sub-Earth track. We find Titan to have globally average radar albedos at this wavelength of 0.161 in the opposite circular polarization sense as that transmitted (OC) and 0.074 in the same sense (SC), giving a polarization ratio SC/OC of 0.46. These values are intermediate between lower reflectivity rocky surfaces and higher reflectivity clean icy surfaces. The variations with longitude in general mirror the surface brightness variations seen through the infrared atmospheric windows. Xanadu Regio's radar reflectivity and polarization ratio are higher than the global averages, and suggest that its composition is relatively cleaner water ice or, possibly, some other material with low propagation loss at radio wavelengths. For all echo spectra most of the power is in a broad diffuse component but with a specular component whose strength and narrowness is highly variable as a function of surface location. For all data we fit a sum of the standard Hagfors scattering law describing the specular component and an empirical diffuse radar scattering model to extract bulk parameters of the surface. Many areas exhibit very narrow specular reflections implying terrain that are quite flat on centimeter to meter scales over spans of tens to perhaps hundreds of kilometers. The proportion of spectra showing these narrow specular echoes has fallen significantly over the observational time span, indicating either a latitudinal effect related to terrain differences or changing surface conditions over the past several years. A few radar tracks, especially those from the 2008 session, overlap some high resolution Cassini RADAR imagery swaths to allow a direct comparison with terrain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Two sedimentary volcanoes were excavated, one in 2016 and the other in 2019, in order to characterise the internal structures. Comparison of the internal structures of these features with those of previously documented seismic-generated sedimentary volcanoes helps in differentiating the various modes of mobilised sediment generation. Sedimentary volcanoes are commonly employed as tools in palaeoseismic reconstruction, thus it is important to establish criteria to differentiate non-seismic-generated sedimentary volcanoes and accompanying sediment deformation from those features generated by earthquakes. Trenches through the volcanoes and immediate subsurface areas reveal a complex cone stratigraphy of centimetre-scale graded sand-silt laminations and clastic dikes that cross-cut the cone and sub-cone (delta) sediment. Some cone strata have ripple cross laminations, a scoured base and are disrupted by soft-sediment deformation. In the 2016 volcano, the lowest 0.5 m of the dikes exposed in the trench are filled with organic-rich mud, but these conduits are empty nearer to the surface as a result of sediment settling after eruption cessation. The 2019 sedimentary volcano differs from the other by: (1) more cross laminations in the cone, (2) collapse structures surrounding the crater, (3) a relatively simple plumbing system assisted by desiccation-generated fissures and (4) a massive sediment infill of the vent. Both complex internal cone stratigraphy and the two distinct cross-cutting dike-conduit systems, unequivocally generated by recurrent gas and water discharge, add to the database of features for non-seismic-generated sedimentary volcanoes. This array of sedimentary structures from a non-seismic-generated sedimentary volcano demonstrates that certain features, including numerous internal laminations composing the cone and complex generations of dike systems are not unique to seismic-generated sand volcanoes.

Horizontal distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH in the lakes was associated with the patchy distribution of aquatic macrophytes in the lake, and the vertical distribution of DO and pH was assocaited with the location of the canopy in the water column. Elevated concentrations of DO and pH were observed in the canopies of submergent species, while lower DO concentrations and pH were seen both in the canopies of floating-leaved species and in the sub-canopy water of both growth forms. Open water was mixed to a greater extent than within macrophyte beds, resulting in higher sub-surface DO concentrations than beneath either submergent or floating plant canopies. Diel changes in DO and pH were associated with the growth form of the macrophytes that formed the plant canopy. Diel pH and DO changes were significant within the canopy of the submergent species that formed in the near-surface waters. Diel changes were not seen in either the surface of floating-leaved macrophytes, or in the sub-canopy of either growth form. In Keevies Lake, in Western Washington, dense canopies of overlapping floating leaves of Brasenia schreberi Gmel. reduced summer surface and sub-canopy dissolved oxygen (DO) to < 2mg 1-1 without significantly changing pH. In canopies of Potamogeton natans L., which has sub-surface, as well as floating leaves, the surface DO concentration was higher than in adjacent open water areas, but sub-canopy DO was as low as beneath B. schreberi canopies. In Bull Lake, in Eastern Washington, surface canopies of the submergent species, Ceratophyllum demersum L. and Myriophyllum exalbescens (Fern.) Jeps., regularly had DO concentrations of >30 mg 1-1 and pH > 10. Beneath these canopies of submergent plants, DO of <1 mg-1 was common at 0.25-0.50 m, and pH was typically 1-2 units lower than at the surface.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				NOV	1990	38	2-3					231	248		10.1016/0304-3770(90)90008-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(90)90008-9													WOS:A1990EK01400008

Dynamic changes, cycling and downward fate of dissolved carbon and nitrogen photosynthetically-derived from glaciers in upper Indus river basin	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Glaciers play key roles in capturing, storing, and transforming global carbon and nitrogen, thereby contributing markedly to their cycles. However, an integrated mechanistic approach is still lacking regarding glacier's primary producers (PP), in terms of stable dissolved inorganic carbon isotope (delta C-13-DIC) and its relationship with dissolved carbon and nitrogen transformation d ynamic changes/cycling. Here, we sampled waters from glaciers, streams, tributaries, and the Indus River (IR) mainstream in the Upper IR Basin, Western Himalaya. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) appears to increase, on average, by similar to 2.5-23.4% with fluctuations when passing from glaciers to streams-tributaries-IR mainstream (the upper and lower parts, respectively) continuum, implying that DOM originates from glaciers PP and is subsequently degraded. The corresponding fluctuations are observed for fluorescent DOM (FDOM), dissolved organic nitrogen (8.0-106.8%), NO3--N (-13.5/+16.6%), NH4+-N (-8.8/+13.0%), and NO2--N (70.7-217.5%). These variations are associated with overall DOM/FDOM transformations, with the production of ending byproducts (e.g. CO2/DIC). The delta C-13-DIC values fluctuated from glaciers (-5.3 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand) to streams (-4.4 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand), tributaries (-4.3 +/- 1.6 parts per thousand), and IR mainstream (-4.2 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand). The delta C-13-DIC data are consistent with C transformations that involve lighter CO2 emission into the atmosphere, whereas highly depleted DIC/CO2 is the signature of DOM degradation after its fresh production from glaciers PP which originated by photosynthetic activities (e.g. uptake/sink of atmospheric CO2: -8.4 parts per thousand). Finally, glacier-fed meltwaters would simultaneously contribute to the biogeochemical characteristics of downward margins and specific ecosystems (lake/pond/groundwater/hot springs) via transformation dynamics/cycling of dissolved C and N with high photo/microbial lability. Our results highlight the substantial contribution of western Himalayan glaciers-derived DOM to the global C and N cycles.

The changes affecting the ecological categories of Coleoptera lead to a division of the sequence into 5 beetle assemblage zones (BAZ): the lowermost BAZ A is characterized by extremely poor assemblages (periglacial environment); BAZ B (Oldest Dryas and Lateglacial Interstadial) is marked by regular occurrences of taxa associated with open environments, aquatic taxa associated with running and highly oxygenated water, and cold adapted taxa with relatively low numbers; BAZ C (Younger Dryas) corresponds to two important events: a particular abundance of cold adapted taxa and a marked decrease of running water taxa, beetles associated with herbaceous vegetation and open environments are also well represented; BAZ D (Early Holocene) corresponds to the total disappearance of cold adapted taxa; the transition BAZ C/BAZ D is marked also by a dramatic peak of running water taxa; the uppermost BAZ E (Early/Mid Holocene) is marked by a total absence of running water taxa which are replaced by standing water or taxa tolerant of a range of water conditions, a particular abundance of wetland taxa, and taxa associated with herbaceous vegetation and open environments. Beetle and pollen data suggest that the harsh climatic conditions prevailing in the Aubrac mountains did not allow warm dependent fauna and trees to establish during the Lateglacial Interstadial, at least in the Roustieres region, and that wide open landscapes occupied the plateau at that time. The Older Dryas, a cold spell previously recorded at La Taphanel (Cantal), is not visible in the Roustieres record, probably because of the higher altitude at Roustieres, whereas the Younger Dryas is strongly expressed. During the Holocene, concordant beetles and pollen data enable to reconstruct the rapid recolonization of the plateau by mesophilous trees (Ulmus, Quercus), suggesting the possible presence of refugia to the southern slopes of the Aubrac plateau. Insect/pollen comparisons provide evidence for hydrological changes in the former lake of Roustieres and suggest that lacustrine water level changes often used as indicator of precipitation regime changes should be taken with caution.

Holocene sea levels, last glacial maximum glaciomarine environments and geophysical models in the northern Irish Sea Basin, UK	MARINE GEOLOGY												Newly acquired geological records from the Isle of Man reveal intercalated intertidal and terrestrial sediments that record a relative sea-level rise from ca. -3.86 m in the early Holocene up to a mid-Holocene maximum between ca. 6.6 and 4.5 cal kyr BP at ca. +2.25 m. When compared with similar marine records from elsewhere in the northern Irish Sea Basin, the sea-level data confirm a strong north-south trend in glacioisostatic loading, but little east to west difference in loading. This pattern results from the central northern sectors of the British ice sheet over Scotland strongly influencing the glacioisostatic downwarping throughout the northern Irish Sea Basin. Differential ice thicknesses over the Irish Sea, the Lake District and Ireland did not cause perturbations of local glacioisostatic signatures. The Holocene marine data in the central Irish Sea record a slow termination of global eustatic sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Geophysical predictions of relative sea level, partially constrained by the Holocene RSL observations but extrapolated to the Last Glacial Maximum, show the potential for shallow marine conditions in the central Irish Sea Basin and in northeast Ireland between ca. 21.0-16.0 cal kyr BP. However, glaciomarine deposits in northeast Ireland suggest the model relative sea-level predictions are too low, and require increased ice loading or a thinner lithosphere to generate extra glacioisostatic depression at the time of deglaciation. Furthermore, predicted deglacial relative sea level for northeast Ireland does not match the geological record, highlighting complex ice margin/ocean interaction during deglaciation. On the Isle of Man, where glacioisostatic loading is of a similar magnitude to that across northeast Ireland, the presence of grounded ice inhibited marine incursion during early deglaciation, but the occurrence of glaciolacustrine conditions along the ice margin as it moved northwards supports model predictions that relative sea-level fell below present during the Late Glacial/early Holocene due to rapid glacioisostatic rebound.

J	Zhang, ZF; Qi, JF; Yu, QG; Wang, SL; Wang, H				Zhang, Zhongfu; Qi, Jinfeng; Yu, Qingguo; Wang, Shenglong; Wang, Hang			Fecal-related anthropogenic sources are key determinants of lake microbiomes through microbial source tracking	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Lake microbiomes are essential indicators of lake health and are strongly influenced by allochthonous microbial communities from various sources within the watershed. However, quantifying the contributions of multiple inputs to lake microbiomes is challenging because of the complex nature of river-lake systems and the presence of many untraceable sources. Here, Jianhu Lake--a geographically simple and closed plateau lake in southwestern China, was surveyed to disentangle the contributions of five distinct sources (three input rivers that receive town sewage, stormwater runoff, and creek spring water, as well as two nonpoint sources, duck ponds and dry farmland) to the overall lake microbiomes. We found that feces-loading sources, namely town sewage and duck aquaculture, accounted for 48.7% of the total variations in lake microbiomes. In contrast, the combined contribution of the remaining three sources amounted to 13.21%, despite these less-influential sources (e.g., stormwater runoff) may introduce an even larger volume of allochthonous materials into the lake. In addition, approximately 38.1% of the variations in the lake microbiomes were attributed to unknown sources. Sewage effluents also caused a significant loss of lake microbial diversity, and there was a tendency for large-scale microbial homogeneity in lake sediments that resembled those from duck ponds. We then used a targeted approach to track host-specific fecal pollution, and found that human feces were the primary source, followed by ruminant and chicken/duck feces, all of which can be successfully traced back to the feces-loading sources. In our further modelling of sediment transport from three rivers into the whole lake, we observed a significant relationship between sediment accumulation and adsorbed microorganisms only for the sewage-receiving river. Together, lines of evidence indicate that both point and nonpoint fecal-related anthropogenic sources possess discriminatory power for shaping microbial geographic patterns of the lake, posing threats to the survival of local indigenous lake microbiomes.					wang, hang/JND-8481-2023	zhang, zhongfu/0000-0003-0334-1268; Wang, Hang/0000-0003-0881-0553													0269-7491	1873-6424				NOV 1	2023	336								122507	10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122507		SEP 2023						37673318					WOS:001075728100001

Shedding light on the Ophel biome: the trans-Tethyan phylogeography of the sulfide shrimp Tethysbaena (Peracarida: Thermosbaenacea) in the Levant	PEERJ												Background. Tethysbaena are small peracarid crustaceans inhabiting extreme environments such as subterranean lakes and thermal springs, represented by endemic species found around the ancient Tethys, including the Mediterranean, Arabian Sea, Mid-East Atlantic, and the Caribbean Sea. Two Tethysbaena species are known from the Levant: T. relicta, found along the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley, and T. ophelicola, found in the Ayyalon cave complex in the Israeli coastal plain, both belonging to the same species-group based on morphological cladistics. Along the biospeleological research of the Levantine subterranean fauna, three biogeographic hypotheses determining their origins were proposed: (1) Pliocenic transgression, (2) Mid-late Miocenic transgression, and (3) The Ophel Paradigm, according to which these are inhabitants of a chemosynthetic biome as old as the Cambrian. Methods. Tethysbaena specimens of the two Levantine species were collected from subterranean groundwaters. We used the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the nuclear ribosomal 28S (28S rRNA) gene to establish the phylogeny of the Levantine Tethysbaena species, and applied a molecular clock approach for inferring their divergence times. Results. Contrary to the morphological cladistic-based classification, we found that T. relicta shares an ancestor with Tethysbaena species from Oman and the Dominican Republic, whereas the circum-Mediterranean species (including T. ophelicola) share another ancestor. The mean age of the node linking T. relicta from the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley and Tethysbaena from Oman was 20.13 MYA. The mean estimate for the divergence of T. ophelicola from the Mediterranean Tethysbaena clade dated to 9.46 MYA. Conclusions. Our results indicate a two-stage colonization of Tethysbaena in the Levant: a late Oligocene transgression, through a marine gulf extending from the Arabian Sea, leading to the colonization of T. relicta in the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley, whereas T. ophelicola, originating from the Mesogean ancestor, inhabited anchialine caves in the coastal plain of Israel during the Mid-Miocene.

Detrital zircon geochronology of Neoproterozoic-Lower Cambrian passive-margin strata of the White-Inyo Range, east-central California: Implications for the Mojave-Snow Lake fault hypothesis	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Correlation of lithotectonic packages across major transcurrent structures is critical to understanding the tectonic evolution of the North American continental margin. Detrital zircon geochronology of uppermost Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic miogeoclinal strata from the White-Inyo Mountains permits evaluation of: (1) the age and provenance of these metasediments and (2) a model for truncation of the passive margin along a postulated large-magnitude Cretaceous dextral shear zone, i.e., the Mojave-Snow Lake fault. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic Wyman Formation, the upper-most Proterozoic Reed Dolomite (Hines Tongue Member), and clastic strata of the Lower Cambrian Deep Springs, Campito (Montenegro Member), Poleta, and Harkless formations reflect ultimate derivation from the adjacent 1.7-pre-1.8 Ga Mojavia terrane and/or 1.7-1.8 Ga Yavapai continental basement, with subsidiary sources in both the ca. 1.4 Ga Yavapai-Mazatzal anorogenic granitoids and the >2.5 Ga North American craton, and a small proportion of 1.0-1.3 Ga grains, most likely reworked from Grenville clastic wedge deposits. Detrital zircon age spectra from the Lower Cambrian Andrews Mountain Member of the Campito Formation are unique in comparison with the remainder of the studied section, containing a major age peak centered at ca. 1.1 Ga and a subsidiary Lower Cambrian age peak, permitting calculation of a ca. 527 +/- 12 (2 sigma) Ma maximum depositional age. These features, in addition to abundant detrital magnetite-ilmenite grains, reflect a distal source for these rocks, most likely from the ca. 1.1 Ga Pikes Peak batholith and/or the Midcontinent rift and ca. 0.53 Ga bimodal intrusions of the Oklahoma-Colorado aulacogen. In terms of zircon age distribution, allochthonous metamorphic pendants in the Snow Lake terrane of the central Sierra Nevada batholith are most similar to those of stratigraphically equivalent units in the Death Valley region and, to lesser degrees, the White-Inyo section, and the Mojave Desert region. Given the similarity and relative proximity of Death Valley facies-assemblages to the Snow Lake terrane, we suggest that the latter was not transported northward from the Mojave Desert region and instead represents footwall assemblages of a late Early to early Middle Jurassic low-angle normal fault system, probably along the outer transform-truncated margin of the Last Chance thrust stack. This model implies a few tens of kilometers of offset, in contrast to the hundreds of kilometers required by the Mojave-Snow Lake fault hypothesis.					; Ernst, W/ABB-5420-2021; Metzger, Ellen/AAN-1991-2020; Powerman, Vladislav/F-9766-2017	Ernst, Wallace/0000-0002-1446-4960; Gottlieb, Eric Shane/0000-0002-4904-9492; Metzger, Ellen/0000-0002-4882-3351; Powerman, Vladislav/0000-0001-7403-501X; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL	2015	127	7-8					926	944		10.1130/B31142.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31142.1													WOS:000359010800002

Late Neogene paleoclimate and paleoenvironment reconstructions from the Pipe Creek Sinkhole, Indiana, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Late Neogene represents warm Earth conditions immediately prior to the development of extensive northern hemisphere glaciation, and this period in Earth history may therefore provide the best available analog for the projected outcome of continued global warming. There are few interior continental sites of Late Neogene age from the eastern half of North America and subsequently very little is known about the conditions characterizing climate. The Early Pliocene (similar to 5 Ma) Pipe Creek Sinkhole (PCS) includes the sediment fill of a complex karst environment that developed in north-central Indiana, USA (Lat. 40 degrees 27' 25.4 ''. Long. 85 degrees 47' 37.2 ''). The site includes more than 3 m of high-chroma, red-colored silty-clay sediment interpreted to be terra rossa. The terra rossa delta(13)C values average -20 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand PDB and are interpreted to represent sediment deposited in a closed cave system under high summer temperatures and with well-drained soils. An in-situ paleosol at the top of the terra rossa represents a transition from a closed cave to an open environment that eventually flooded, thereby becoming a small pond. delta(13)C values from lacustrine sediments with organic matter derived dominantly from algae average -20.6 parts per thousand and suggest the pond was stagnant and enriched with bicarbonate from the underlying limestones or via aquifers. Pond sediments include abundant vertebrate fossils, which are broadly consistent with those inhabiting an open ecosystem such as a savannah or parkland. However, the PCS pollen includes low taxonomic diversity that is dominated by pine with some hickory and flowering plants, but no grass pollen. We propose two hypotheses to explain the PCS stratigraphic record: (1) The pollen assemblage may represent a local pine dominated ecosystem associated with the pond paleoenvironment, such as a riparian community, and that the greater landscape was drier and open; (2) Alternatively, the climate may have became wetter raising the elevation of the groundwater table and initiating the formation of the pond. Then in response to the wetter conditions an early succession forest ecosystem developed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Metabolic Capability and Phylogenetic Diversity of Mono Lake during a Bloom of the Eukaryotic Phototroph Picocystis sp Strain ML	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Algal blooms in lakes are often associated with anthropogenic eutrophication; however, they can occur without the human introduction of nutrients to a lake. A rare bloom of the alga Picocystis sp. strain ML occurred in the spring of 2016 at Mono Lake, a hyperalkaline lake in California, which was also at the apex of a multiyear-long drought. These conditions presented a unique sampling opportunity to investigate microbiological dynamics and potential metabolic function during an intense natural algal bloom. We conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis along a depth transect near the center of the lake from the surface to a depth of 25 m in June 2016. Across sampled depths, rRNA gene sequencing revealed that Picocystis-associated chloroplasts were found at 40 to 50% relative abundance, greater than values recorded previously. Despite high relative abundances of the photosynthetic oxygenic algal genus Picocystis, oxygen declined below detectable limits below a depth of 15 m, corresponding with an increase in microorganisms known to be anaerobic. In contrast to previously sampled years, both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggested a depletion of anaerobic sulfate-reducing microorganisms throughout the lake's water column. Transcripts associated with photosystem I and II were expressed at both 2 m and 25 m, suggesting that limited oxygen production could occur at extremely low light levels at depth within the lake. Blooms of Picocystis appear to correspond with a loss of microbial activity such as sulfate reduction within Mono Lake, yet microorganisms may survive within the sediment to repopulate the lake water column as the bloom subsides. IMPORTANCE Mono Lake, California, provides a habitat to a unique ecological community that is heavily stressed due to recent human water diversions and a period of extended drought. To date, no baseline information exists from Mono Lake to understand how the microbial community responds to human-influenced drought or algal bloom or what metabolisms are lost in the water column as a consequence of such environmental pressures. While previously identified anaerobic members of the microbial community disappear from the water column during drought and bloom, sediment samples suggest that these microorganisms survive at the lake bottom or in the subsurface. Thus, the sediments may represent a type of seed bank that could restore the microbial community as a bloom subsides. Our work sheds light on the potential photosynthetic activity of the halotolerant alga Picocystis sp. strain ML and how the function and activity of the remainder of the microbial community responds during a bloom at Mono Lake.

We report the stratification dynamics and water chemistry of this lake (including the nutrient availability and trace metal dynamics), as well as basic parameters related to the biological activity, such as C>2 consumption and redox chemistry Our results show that Marbore is ultra-oligotrofic and hosts very low biological activity, typical of high mountain lakes A slight stratification developed at the beginning of the ice-free period, with small vertical gradients in temperature (3-11 degrees C) and electrical conductivity (60-100 pS/cm) between the bottom (situated at approximately 28 m depth) and the lake surface The current pH (between 7.0 and 7.8, which is lower than previous measurements) is not compatible with the formation of calcite in the water column This finding is coherent with the mineralogy of the sedimentary record The most interesting geochemical finding, however, relates to the presence of significant concentrations of dissolved trace metals (Fe and Zn) and sulfate, along with suspended mineral particles (including sulfates), near the thermocline These high concentrations suggest that local sulfide oxidation processes influence the lake chemistry.

While numerous studies have assessed heavy metal concentrations in various aquatic systems, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis comparing the quality of drainage sediments from diverse (urban, agricultural) areas within large-scale hydrosystems. This study addresses this gap by examining metal contamination in drainage channel sediments across the Danube-Tisza-Danube (DTD) Hydrosystem in Northern Serbia, which spans 1.42 Mha. Sediments from urban areas (Urb, n = 45) exhibited significantly higher concentrations of all analysed metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn) compared to those from agricultural areas (Agr, n = 41), except for Cr. While all metal concentrations in Agr sediments remained within the safe limits, a minority of Urb sediments exceeded the maximum allowable concentration. The calculated Geoaccumulation Index (I-geo), Potential Ecological Risk Factor (E-r), and Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI) differed significantly between Agr and Urb sediments. The majority of Agr sediments (95-100 %) were classified as unpolluted to moderately polluted (0 < I-geo <1). In contrast, while most Urb sediments fell within acceptable quality classes (I-geo < 2), some samples exhibited poorer sediment quality (2 < I-geo < 5), indicating moderate to strong pollution levels. Additionally, Agr (vs Urb) sediments exhibited lower E-r values with a narrower range. All Agr sediments scorred the low-risk class (RI < 150), while 89 % of Urb sediments were also classified as low risk, with 6.7 % and 4.4 % categorized as moderate and very high risk, respectively. Principal Component Analysis identified two significant factors in Agr sediments, explaining 78.5 % of the total variance, whereas in Urb sediments, a more complex three-factor structure accounted for 88 % of the total variance. These findings highlight the substantial impact of urban pollution on sediment quality, emphasizing the need for targeted monitoring and remediation strategies to mitigate metal contamination and protect aquatic ecosystems within the DTD hydrosystem.

The relative influences of climate and volcanic activity on Holocene lake development inferred from a mountain lake in central Kamchatka	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A sediment sequence was taken from a closed, high altitude lake (informal name Olive-backed Lake) in the central mountain range of Kamchatka, in the Russian Far East. The sequence was dated by radiocarbon and tephrochronology and used for multi-proxy analyses (chironomids, pollen, diatoms). Although the evolution of Beringian climate through the Holocene is primarily driven by global forcing mechanisms, regional controls, such as volcanic activity or vegetation dynamics, lead to a spatial heterogeneous response. This study aims to reconstruct past changes in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and to separate the climate-driven response from a response to regional or localised environmental change. Radiocarbon dates from plant macrophytes gave a basal date of 7800 cal yr BP. Coring terminated in a tephra layer, so sedimentation at the lake started prior to this date, possibly in the early Holocene following local glacier retreat. Initially the catchment vegetation was dominated by Betula and Alnus woodland with a mosaic of open, wet, aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Between 7800 and 6000 cal yr BP the diatom-inferred lake water was pH 4.4-53 and chironomid and diatom assemblages in the lake were initially dominated by a small number of acidophilic/acid tolerant taxa. The frequency of Pinus pumila (Siberian dwarf pine) pollen increased from 5000 cal yr BP and threshold analysis indicates that P. pumila arrived in the catchment between 4200 and 3000 cal yr BP. Its range expansion was probably mediated by strengthening of the Aleutian Low pressure system and increased winter snowfall. The diatominferred pH reconstructions show that after an initial period of low pH, pH gradually increased from 5500 cal yr BP to pH 5.8 at 1500 cal yr BP. This trend of increasing pH through the Holocene is unusual in lake records, but the initially low pH may have resulted directly or indirectly from intense regional volcanic activity during the midHolocene. The chironomid-inferred July temperature reconstruction suggests cool periods between 32002800 cal yr BP and 1100-700 cal yr BP and a warmer period between 2800 and 1100 cal yr BP. Chironomid and diatom DCA scores decline from ca. 6000 cal yr BP, indicating compositional changes in these aquatic assemblages. In comparison declines in pollen PCA scores are delayed, starting ca. 5100 cal yr BP. The results suggest that while catchment vegetation was responding primarily to climate change, the biota within the lake and lake water chemistry were responding to localised environmental conditions.

J	Casamitjana, X; Colomer, J; Fernando, HJS				Casamitjana, X; Colomer, J; Fernando, HJS			Fluidization of sediments in a conical basin by subterranean springs: relevance to Lake Banyoles	AQUATIC SCIENCES												An experimental study was carried out to investigate the resuspension of particles by a momentum jet discharging from below into a conical basin. The work was motivated by its relevance to Lake Banyoles, where sediments are suspended in different conical basins by bottom jets fed by a groundwater karstic system. Two different flow regimes were identified: a "Jet Flow" regime (JF) and a "Lutocline Flow" regime (LF). In the LF regime, the particles were resuspend ed, forming a well-established interface along the entire cross-sectional ara of the cone. This regime occurs when the particle Reynolds number Re-p = (u-w(s))d(p)/nu (where u is the mean velocity of the flow at the jet entry, w(s) is the settling velocity of particles, d(p) is the diameter of that particles and nu is the kinematic viscosity of water) is below a critical number Re-c that depends on the slope of the basin. The maximum height to which particles rise in the LF regime was also determined as a function of four non-dimensional variables: D-1 = h(o)/(M-o(1/2)/w(s)), D-2 = h(o)/d(p), Re-p and tan beta (where h(o) is the height of the particle bed, M-o is the kinematic momentum flux of the jet and tan beta is the slope of the basin). Application of the results to the basins of Lake Banyoles showed a good agreement provided that the aggregate properties of the suspensions are used. It is also shown that, in the LF regime, inflows to the basins can be estimated by a simple technique based on a balance between the sedimentation flux and the upward advection of sediments by the mean flow.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018	Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269; casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; 													1015-1621						2000	62	1					79	90		10.1007/s000270050077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050077													WOS:000087179300006
J	OREMLAND, RS; MILLER, LG; WHITICAR, MJ				OREMLAND, RS; MILLER, LG; WHITICAR, MJ			SOURCES AND FLUX OF NATURAL GASES FROM MONO LAKE, CALIFORNIA	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The ability to identify a formation mechanism for natural gas in a particular environment requires consideration of several geochemical factors when there are multiple sources present. Four primary sources of methane have been identified in Mono Lake. Two of these sources were associated with numerous natural gas seeps which occur at various locations in the lake and extend beyond its present boundary; the two other gas sources result from current microbiological processes. In the natural gas seeps, we observed flow rates as high as 160 moles CH4 day-1, and estimate total lakewide annual seep flux to be 2.1 .times. 106 moles CH4. Geochemical parameters (.delta.13CH4;, .delta.DCH4, CH4/[C2H6 + C2H8]) and .DELTA.14CH4 measurements revealed that most of the seeps originate from a paleo-biogenic (.delta.13CH4 = about -70.permill.) natural gas deposit of Pleistocene age which underlies the current and former labeled. Gas seeps in the vicinity of hot springs had, in combination with the biogenic gas, a prominent thermogenic gas component resulting from hydrothermal alteration of buried organic matter. Current microbiological processes responsible for sources of natural gas in the lake included pelagic methanogenesis and decomposition of terrestrial grasses in the littoral zone. Methanogenesis in the pelagic sediments resulted in methane saturation (2-3 mM at 50 cm; .delta.13CH4 = about -85.permill.). Interstitial sulfate decreased from 133 mM at the surface to 35 mM by 110cm depth, indicating that sulfate-reduction and methanogenesis operated concurrently. Methane diffused out of the sediments resulting in concentrations of about 50 .mu.M in the anoxic bottom waters. Methane oxidation in the oxic/anoxic boundary lowered the concentration by >98%, but values in surface waters (0.1-1.3 .mu.M) were supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere. The .delta.13CH4 (range = -21.8 to -71.8.permill.) of this unoxidized residual methane was enriched in 13C relative to methane in the bottom water and sediments. Average outward flux of this methane was 2.77 .times. 107 moles yr-1. A fourth, but minor source of methane (.delta.13CH4 = -55.2.permill.) was associated with the decomposition of terrestrial grasses taking place in the lake''s recently expanded littoral zone.

Application of Semiochemicals to Assess the Biodiversity of Subcortical Insects following an Ecosystem Disturbance in a Sub-boreal Forest	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												From 2000 through 2003 we used semiochemical-baited traps in northeastern Minnesota, USA, to assess changes in assemblages of subcortical forest insects after a catastrophic wind storm in 1999 and subsequent (1999-2000) fuel-reduction activities (salvage-logging and prescribed-burning). We determined the regional efficacy of fifteen semiochemical blends (pheromones and kairomones) as attractants for target and non-target subcortical insect species (Coleoptera: Anthribidae, Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Cleridae, Cucujidae, Curculionidae, Histeridae, Nemonychidae, Salpingidae, Scolytidae, Tenebrionidae, and Hymenoptera: Siricidae). During the four summers, we trapped 86,471 subcortical insects (143 species) in baited and unbaited Lindgren funnel traps, and 500 beetles (44 species) in baited and unbaited pitfall traps. We report 23 new state collection records of subcortical insects from Minnesota. Trap catches of subcortical insects were greatest in the wind-disturbed areas 2 years after the event, and declined thereafter. Similar trends were observed for subcortical insects in the burned areas. Both wind-disturbance and burning increased the subcortical insect species richness and diversity on the landscape. The subcortical insect species compositions of the salvaged and burned forest areas differed from those of the undisturbed and wind-disturbed areas. Trap catches of subcortical insects in response to semiochemical treatments also varied with year of sampling and land-area treatment. The greatest diversity of subcortical beetle species was in traps baited with attractants for the scolytids, Dendroctonus valens [(+)-alpha-pinene and (-)-beta-pinene] and Dryocoetes spp. [exo-brevicomin and (-)-alpha-pinene], perhaps reflecting the generic nature of the baits. The most distinct species compositions were collected in response to the woodborer and Dendroctonus simplex baits, whereas the species compositions in traps with the D. valens and Dryocoetes spp. baits, and the unbaited funnel trap were the most similar. The variation in trap catch with time and across landscapes suggests that the responses of subcortical insects to semiochemicals are more complex than previously appreciated.

S	Bartumeus, F; Ventura, M; Catalan, J		Catalan, J; Curtis, CJ; Kernan, M		Bartumeus, Frederic; Ventura, Marc; Catalan, Jordi			Factors shaping diversity patterns in pelagic rotifer assemblages of high mountain lakes (Pyrenees)	PATTERNS AND FACTORS OF BIOTA DISTRIBUTION IN REMOTE EUROPEAN MOUNTAIN LAKES	Advances in Limnology											Factors shaping diversity patterns of pelagic rotifer assemblages were studied from data collected on 80 Pyrenean lakes during summer 2000. Different diversity aspects were investigated for the whole set of lakes (i.e. the metacommunity) and for a series of subsets (i.e. local communities): i) species incidences, rank abundance distribution and species richness per lake, ii) beta-diversity spectra of species richness and Shannon index in relation to different environmental and ecological gradients, and iii) species abundance distributions (SADs). Our results show the basic patterns of rotifer diversity in the Pyrenees. We found that gradients of altitude, depth, macrozooplankton (MZP) abundance and especially the organic matter content (measured as the percentage of matter loss on ignition, LOI) were shaping rotifer beta-diversity in the Pyrenees. In particular, the percentage of LOI has a relevant impact on plankton abundances in both rotifers and MZP. At the metacommunity level, the SAD showed a power law with an exponent beta approximate to -1. Exactly the same behaviour was observed for randomly grouped local communities. However, local communities including lakes located at the lowest altitudes (1620-2210 in a.s.l.) or with low organic matter content (i.e. <17% LOI) showed deviations from beta approximate to -1. Based on these analyses our main conclusions are: (i) three main factors were shaping rotifer diversity patterns: the presence of littoral species in pelagic rotifer assemblages in shallow lakes, the carbon flux through the lake, and the existence of increasing environmental restrictions in altitude; (ii) assuming neutral theory to be an appropriate model, our results suggest that rotifer species are not strongly limited by dispersal in the Pyrenees; and (iii) differentiation between local communities and the metacommunity was only detectable on the basis of major environmental changes (e.g. altitude, LOI).

However, the understanding of their complex deformation mechanism remains limited. As a representative case, the Xiaomojiu landslide is selected to reveal the deformation mechanism of large deep-seated deposit landslides in the upper Jinsha River. The landslide volume is estimated to be approximately 5.04-7.56 x 107 m3, and it can be divided into four distinct zones in plane: source zone, right flank scarp, accumulation zone, and front collapse zone. The buried depth of the deep sliding surface in the middle and front of the landslide is approximately 40-50 m, with several secondary sliding surfaces developed within the landslide deposits. The long-term surface deformation predominantly occurs in the middle and left front of the landslide, which is still in the stage with constant-rate deformation at present. The longitudinal gradient, erosion rate, and steepness index of the Jinsha River are significant factors that contribute to long-term intense river erosion, which is an important factor for the long-term creep deformation of the landslide. Following the Baige landslide in 2018, both the deformation range and rate of the Xiaomojiu landslide increased significantly, indicating that the short-term extreme river erosion events, including barrier lakes and outburst floods, are critical factors contributing to the exacerbated short-term landslide deformation. The free faces of the deeply incised gullies have altered the development directions of tensile fissures and fall scarps on both sides, indicating that these deeply incised gullies caused by precipitation-induced surface erosion have exacerbated the deformation and failure of rock and soil masses. In summary, it can be inferred that the potential instability mode of the Xiaomojiu landslide is characterized as a front-traction and rear-tension type under the combined action of long-term intense river erosion, short-term extreme river erosion, and precipitation-induced surface erosion. The research findings provide new insights into the deformation mechanism of large deep-seated deposit landslide in alpine canyon areas.					ni, jiawei/NCV-7742-2025; Guo, Changbao/HSH-4101-2023														1612-510X	1612-5118				JUN	2025	22	6					1973	1988		10.1007/s10346-025-02483-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-025-02483-1		FEB 2025											WOS:001467227500001
J	Manville, V; Wilson, CJN				Manville, V; Wilson, CJN			The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption, New Zealand: a review of the roles of volcanism and climate in the post-eruptive sedimentary response	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												The landscape response to large explosive pyroclastic volcanic eruptions is one of the most dramatic processes in sedimentology and geomorphology. Processes of post-eruptive erosion and resedimentation are maximised by large erupted volumes, abundant unconsolidated ash-sized material, destruction of the vegetation cover (particularly by burial by ignimbrite), and inhibition of vegetation regrowth (e.g., by harsh climatic conditions). The 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption from Taupo volcano in the central North Island of New Zealand created optimal conditions for a large-scale sedimentary response that was influenced and prolonged by the succeeding climatic nadir of the Last Glacial Maximum. About 530 km(3) of rhyolitic magma was erupted as 420 km(3) of fall deposits, 320 km(3) of pyroclastic density current deposits (mostly non-welded ignimbrite), and 430 km(3) of primary intracaldera fill. The eruption, and formation of the Oruanui caldera, destroyed one major lake but created the forerunner to modern Lake Taupo. This lake initially stably overflowed to the northwest before breaking out in a catastrophic flood during establishment of a northeasterly outlet along the line of the modern Waikato River. Suppression of revegetation by the contemporaneous harsh periglacial climate contributed to intense erosion and remobilisation of Oruanui pyroclastic units, triggering massive downstream fluvial aggradation in impacted catchments. In particular, aggradation caused the lower 180 km of the Waikato River to avulse from its long-established route via the Hauraki Plains into the Hamilton Basin where it was subsequently trapped. Aeolian reworking created localised dune fields, while generation of tephric loess formed deposits over much of the central North Island. The initial perturbation to fluvial sedimentary systems created by the eruption was generally sustained by climatic conditions until c. 17 ka. Climatic amelioration eventually stabilised primary sediment sources through the re-establishment of forest vegetation, but incision and recycling of alluvial material stored in volcaniclastic fans continued until as late as c. 14 ka. Overall, the scale of the post-Oruanui sedimentary response was primarily driven by characteristics of the eruption, whereas its duration was controlled by the Last Glacial Maximum climate.					; Wilson, Colin/E-9457-2011	Manville, Vernon/0000-0002-0829-1012; Wilson, Colin/0000-0001-7565-0743													0028-8306					SEP	2004	47	3					525	547		10.1080/00288306.2004.9515074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2004.9515074													WOS:000224757300015

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 347.4-409.7, 342.8-417.3 and 348.5-417.0 ppm in the up-, mid- and down-stream areas, respectively; while atmospheric CH4 concentrations were 1.59-1.98, 1.74-2.20 and 1.60-2.43 ppm, respectively. Using the headspace method with brown color bottle, CO2 concentrations were 665-6 917, 1 485-9 369 and 1 443-9 637 ppm, respectively; while CH4 concentrations fell into the range of 11.8-309.0, 66.0-6 288.2 and 24.1-4 627.5 ppm, respectively. Using the static-chamber method, CO2 emission rates were -22.3-140.5, -31.7-194.7 and -27.5-226.6 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively; and CH4 emission rates were 0.02-5.52, 1.55-144.54 and 0.11-14.10 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively. CO2 and CH4 emission rates had higher values in the mid- and down-stream areas than those in the up- stream area because of the input of industrial, livestock and domestic wastewaters in mid- and down-stream areas. CO2 emission rates were negative might be because of the measurement times were at noon and some photosynthetic microbes and microalgae in the water were undergoing active photosynthesis. There is a good correlation between the results of headspace and static-chamber methods. CO2 emissions had very significant positive correlations with Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Organic Matter (SOM); and significant negative correlation with Dissolved Oxygen (DO). CH4 emission had very significant positive correlations with BOD, SOM and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N); significant positive correlation with Suspended Inorganic Matter (SIM); very significant negative correlation with DO; and significant negative correlation with redox potential (Eh). DO, Eh, SOM, SIM and NH4-N were the major factors that affected CO2 and CH4 emissions from water. In the assessment of carbon deposited amount from river to ocean, the annual carbon flows of Tanswei River were estimated with the annual flow amounts and COD, it were 8.9x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 3.9x10(4), 2.7x10(4) and 1.2x10(4) tons in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

The Zhaocun site, located in the northeastern part of the North China Plain, is not only the first Late Paleolithic site discovered in the southern piedmont of the Yan Mountains, but also an important representative of Late Pleistocene strata and fossil fauna in North China. However, there have been few studies of the upper cultural layer at the site which have focused on the development of Paleolithic culture, especially the microlithic technology, in the context of environmental changes; moreover, no absolute age determinations are available. Here we present a study of the paleoenvironmental record of the Zhibuchang profile at the Zhaocun site during the interval of 27.6-23.6 cal. kyr BP. We conducted a stratigraphic study based on pollen and grain-size analyses of 78 samples from the profile, and obtained 7 AMS C-14 dates. During 27.6-26.6 cal. kyr BP, the regional vegetation was relatively diverse meadow steppe dominated by Artemisia and Asteraceae. The climate, although colder and drier than today, was the warmest record within the studied profile, and was relatively favorable for human beings. From 26.6 cal. kyr BP, with the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, the climate became colder and more variable, with two extreme climatic events occurred at 26.2-25.5 cal. kyr BP and 24.3-23.6 cal. kyr BP, respectively. A cold wet event from 26.2 to 25.5 cal. kyr BP led to a drastic decline in local biodiversity, which would have resulted in food shortages for human beings. In addition, previous areas available for human activities were gradually flooded due to the rising river level, forcing the relocation of human beings and resulting in the termination of the cultural layer. A cold dry event from 24.3 to 23.6 cal. kyr BP, which may correspond to North Atlantic Heinrich event 2, caused a further deterioration of the environment for human beings, and may be a major cause of the absence of microlithic cultural remains on the northeastern part of the North China Plain during late MIS-2.

J	Carnevale, G; Pellegrino, L; Natalicchio, M; Dela Pierre, F				Carnevale, Giorgio; Pellegrino, Luca; Natalicchio, Marcello; Dela Pierre, Francesco			The Messinian fishes of Capo di Fiume (Palena, Abruzzo): Stratigraphy, taphonomy and paleoecology	BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA PALEONTOLOGICA ITALIANA												The Messinian laminated diatomites exposed in the Capo di Fiume stratigraphic section, near the town of Palena, along the slopes of Mt. Porrara in the Abruzzo Apennines, contain well-preserved articulated fish skeletal remains, often associated with plants. A large collection of fossils from this section was accumulated and donated by Erminio Di Carlo to the Museo Geopaleontologico dell'Alto Aventino, Palena, Italy. Herein, we present the stratigraphy of the Capo di Fiume section and a preliminary biosedimentological study of the fossiliferous laminated diatomites. A taphonomic and paleoecological analysis of the fish remains deriving from the oldest diatomite interval of the succession is also included. The sedimentary succession documents the transition from continental to paralic to coastal to open marine conditions, suggesting the existence of a rather narrow shelf connecting coastal and basinal areas. The deposition of the diatomite laminae took place through different biological mechanisms, most notably the so-called "fall dump", which involved the formation of flocs (mucilaginous aggregates) that included diatom assemblages dominated by Coscinodiscus spp. and Thalassionema nitzschioides. The macrofossil assemblage of the diatomites and the biosedimentological study of the laminated fossiliferous diatomites have provided new data regarding the paleoenvironmental and paleophysiographic setting and the ecological relationships. The diatom content of the fossiliferous (biogenic) laminae as well as the structure and composition of the fish assemblage clearly indicate a depositional marine environment with depths of up to several tens of meters. The fish assemblage is largely dominated by the round herring Spratelloides lemoinei, which represented the trophic nucleus of the original fish community. This and other clupeid species and certain "adventitious visitors" occupied the upper portion of the water column. The "adventitious visitors" are represented by mesopelagic diel vertical migrants (Diaphus edwardsi, Lestidiops sphekodes, Maurolicus cf. muelleri, Myctophum columnae, Paralepis albyi), which were probably attracted in the Capo di Fiume paleobiotope by abundant planktonic organisms as well as by shoals of Spratelloides lemoinei. The lower portion of the water column and the seafloor were well aerated and occupied by a diverse community of demersal fish taxa, especially sparids. The rapid deposition of diatom mats, abundantly represented in the fossiliferous intervals, may have resulted in the swift entombment of fish carcasses, whose fossilization was promoted even under relatively well-oxygenated bottom conditions.					; Dela Pierre, Francesco/I-8735-2012; Pellegrino, Luca/V-1903-2018	Pellegrino, Luca/0000-0003-2762-9821; 													0375-7633						2022	61	2					91	118		10.4435/BSPI.2022.07	http://dx.doi.org/10.4435/BSPI.2022.07													WOS:000913178800002

The sediment core, which is 8.4 m in length, documents the development of the reservoir since the melting of dead ice and formation of the lake basin, i.e., before 13,000 years BP, until it became overgrown with plants. The characteristics of the sediments changed from mineral deposits on the bottom (silty sands) to biogenic deposits consisting of dark olive calcareous detritus gyttja and light calcareous gyttja with increasing carbonate content and to peat in the upper part. Based on the data (chemical, stable isotopes, subfossil Cladocera remains, pollen), we have distinguished three main stages of the evolution of Romoty paleolake. The first stage includes the formation of the lake basin in the Late Glacial and early Holocene (Preboreal). The second stage is characterized by the harmonic, natural development of the Romoty paleolake from the Boreal to Subboreal. This stage coincides with a period of climatic warming, and biogenic sediments accumulated in this reservoir at that time. The third stage concerns the disappearance of the lake in the late Holocene (Subatlantic). The lake conditions declined, and the reservoir completely filled with sediments and has transformed into a mire. The characterization of each stage involves a description of environmental conditions occurring in the Romoty paleolake, particularly the Cladocera community, the chemical composition, the temperature and trophy of the water, the water level, the nature of bottom sediments, and the plants occurring in the reservoir and its surroundings. The lowest water temperature occurred in the Late Glacial and Preboreal periods. Since the Boreal period, gradual warming is observed and is expressed through a positive trend in both delta O-18 and delta C-13 and changes in both Cladocera and plant compositions. The lake was deepest at the beginning of the Holocene as a result of dead ice melting (supply of melt water; lowering of the lake bottom) and/or increased precipitation (change in atmospheric circulation). The water level fell during the Atlantic period. Additionally, the cladoceran and non-pollen palynomorph data indicate low trophy followed by an increase in the mesotrophic state. Human impact was documented only by a low occurrence of pollen grains of Cerealia in the youngest sediments (Subatlantic period), suggesting a low penetration by human groups of the area near the Romoty paleolake.

J	Leips, J; Travis, J				Leips, J; Travis, J			The comparative expression of life-history traits and its relationship to the numerical dynamics of four populations of the least killifish	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1, We examined the numerical dynamics in four natural populations of the least killifish [Heterandria formosa Agassiz (1855)]; to ascertain how those dynamics affected the expression of key life-history traits and, in turn, whether life-history variation among populations might be responsible for different dynamic properties. Populations were chosen from two types of communities, spring-fed rivers and lakes, to examine the relative influence of community characteristics on these relationships. 2. Populations in lakes had lower densities, more female-biased sex ratios and a smaller proportion of immature individuals than populations in rivers. Predator faunas differed between habitats and the ratio of predator to H. formosa density was higher in lakes than in rivers. 3. Females in lake populations were 35-40% larger than river females. Female size was positively correlated with the number of broods carried by a female at any given time and the number of offspring in a particular brood. These correlations and the larger body size of females in lake populations indicate that the reproductive output per female was higher in lake than river populations. 4, Female size was negatively correlated with population density in two of the four populations. After adjusting for the variation in female size, brood size and brood numbers were negatively correlated with population density in only the highest density population. 5. Average offspring size was negatively correlated with brood size in all of the populations, indicating a general trade-off between offspring size and number. The average offspring size in the highest density population was as much as 45% larger than that of all other populations, an effect independent of any phenotypic plasticity in offspring size with respect to female body size or density. 6. The effects of density on female body size are the major avenue for negative feedback of population density on the subsequent dynamics through life-history expression. Whether such an effect is stabilizing or destabilizing cannot yet be determined. If the variation in offspring size among populations is adaptive, it may be a prominent example of density-dependent life-history evolution.

Highly purified SR was isolated from the fast trunk muscles of Notothenia rossii (Antarctica -2 to + 2.degree. C). Salmo gairdneri (temperate rivers 2.degree.-12.degree. C). Tilapia mossambica and Sarcocherodon niloticus (African freshwater lakes, 20-30.degree. C). Assayed at 30.degree. C, the Ca2+-ATPases of the different species are similar. At 0.degree. C the Ca2+-ATPase of the cold-adapted species is 7-20 times higher than for the 2 tropical fish. Activities of the Ca2+-independent ATPase did not correlate with environmental temperatures at any assay temperature. Values of activation enthalpy (.DELTA.H*) are positively correlated with environmental temperature for the Ca2+-dependent but not the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity of fish SR. The Ca2+ concentration required to give 1/2 Vmax (KCa) [rate constant] is dependent on assay temperature. At 0.degree. C, the magnitude of KCa is positively correlated with environmental temperature varying from 0.7-8.6 .mu.mol in N. rossii and S. niloticus, respectively. When determined at the environmental temperature normal for each species there is a considerable degree of conservation of KCa with values falling in the range 0.4-0.7 .mu.m. The ratio of Ca2+-dependent to total ATPases is around 80-90% for the Antarctic fish at assay temperatures between 0.degree. and 30.degree. C. In contrast for the 2 tropical species, the ratio of Ca2+-dependent to total ATPases rises from 0 to 15% at 0.degree. C to around 85-90% at 25-30.degree. C. Over the normal environmental-temperature range for each species a similar proportion of the total ATPase activity is Ca2+-dependent.

While much remains to be discovered, researchers have established that the deep sea is being exposed to numerous anthropogenic factors including chemical pollution. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), defined by their persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation, and toxicity, are continually discharged and transported into the deep sea despite efforts to ban or reduce their production under global and regional conventions. Here, we provide the first evidence of these POPs in sediment and biota in the Pacific abyssal plain, an area currently targeted for deep-sea mining. Sediment and fish tissue (Coryphaenoides sp., a deep-ocean predator and scavenger fish) collected from two sites in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone of the Pacific abyssal plain were tested for three POPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Similarities between the sites in PCB congener concentrations suggested that PCBs were distributed evenly over the region. Conversely, higher variability in PBDE congener concentrations and PFAS concentrations from the same sites suggested that these chemicals had more patchy distributions across the region. Sediment PFAS were especially variable, detected at a high concentration (1.5 ng/g wet weight) in only one of five samples but measured in all fish muscle samples at levels comparable to some freshwater ecosystems. Results suggest that raining particulates (e.g., particulate organic matter and microplastics) dominate vertical transport of PCBs, resulting in more uniform distribution, while episodic events such as carrion-fall and vertically migrating species may drive PFAS transport processes resulting in patchy spatial distributions and differences in scavenging biota versus sediment. Unintentional PCBs (e.g., pigment components) comprised a large proportion of total PCBs in sediment and muscle tissue, suggesting that unregulated PCB releases are accumulating in the deep Pacific Ocean.

However, the well-known serpentinization reaction does not appear to be the main mechanism generating H-2 at this site. Rather, the H-2 is generated as follows: (1) by alteration of basaltic lava at depth via reaction with seawater flowing from Ghoubbet Bay towards Lake Asal; (2) by simple degassing of the volcanic chamber located a few kilometers below the Fiale Caldera in the rift axis; or (3) as a result of pyritization processes via the oxidation of H2S. Study of microorganisms did not indicate any production or consumption of H-2, CO2, or CH4; therefore, it is unlikely that microorganisms affected H-2 gas contents measured at the surface. However, air contamination at fumaroles is typically considerable and may limit interpretation of such processes. Drill cuttings from the Fiale 1 (F1) and Gale le Goma 1 (Glc1) wells (located on the inner and outer rift margins, respectively) were analyzed to determine where H-2 is generated. Total rock analyses indicated distinct zones at depths of 464 m and 280 m for F1 and Glc1, respectively, representing the boundary between the Asal and Stratoid Basalts. Fe-57 Mossbauer analyses show a decrease in the percentage of Fe3+ at depth, indicating that Fe2+-rich minerals, particularly in the Stratoid Basalts, may be a source of H-2. Based on well data from the rift center and the outer rift margin, it is evident that H-2 is present at the surface in the rift axis and that this area offers good remnant potential because of the presence of Fe-rich chlorite. Conversely, few H-2 emissions were measured at the surface on the outer rift margins, although well data showed some H-2 (similar to 0.25%) at depth. The presence of a cap rock in the rift axis has not yet been proven; however, the high loss on ignition and the mineralogy in well Glc1 may indicate that the rocks are sufficiently altered into clays to offer potential as a H-2 seal. If so, the rift margins would offer greater exploration potential than the rift center.					; ranchou-peyruse, anthony/AAO-7576-2020; moretti, isabelle/LTD-2093-2024	moretti, isabelle/0000-0003-4215-4764; Pasquet, Gabriel/0000-0002-5285-728X; Guignard, Marion/0009-0000-3855-1076													0037-9409	1777-5817				JUN 2	2023	194								9	10.1051/bsgf/2023004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bsgf/2023004													WOS:000998664000001

The thick strata of the Sanmen Group deposited in the large basin. The Sanmen Group is a perfect place for the study on paleoenvironmental change, tectono-climatic cycles as well as the formation and evolution of the Yellow River. In this paper, the paleoenvironmental changes, regional tectonic movement and the evolutionary process of the Sanmen Lake Basin during the past 5 Ma were reconstructed based on the analysis of paleomagnetic stratigraphy, pollen, TOC and carbonate content from the Huangdigou outcrop near the Sanmenxia Reservoir, Pinglu County, Shanxi Province. The sedimentary records from the outcrop indicate that the basin was first formated by fault activity at about 5.4 MaBP, and after the strong tectonic movement at 3.6 MaBP the lake enlarged and the rainfall of summer monsoon increased. There was no great climatic transition near 2.6 MaBP, corresponding to the bottom age of loess in the Loess Plateau. After Olduvai event (about 1.77 MaBP) the Picea and Abies were presented in the sediments, which indicates a colder climate. The tectonic movement at 1.2 MaBP caused the light angular discordance between the upper and lower Sanmen Group. The sedimentary records show a cold and wet climate during the prosperous periods of loess accumulation such as L-15, L-9, L-6. The tectonic intensification periods of the Sanmen Basin correspond with the tectonic movements in the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau chronologically. The earliest age of the outflow from the Paleo-Sanmen Lake or the partly cutting off of the Sanmenxia Gorge was about 0.41-0.35 MaBp. The age of cutting thoroughly the Sanmenxia Gorge by the Yellow River and the disappearance of the Paleo-Sanmen Lake was about 0.15 MaBP, which symbolized the formation of the present Yellow River and had an important influence on the environmental and morphological evolution in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River.

Previous studies have primarily relied on the area-storage model to estimate reservoir water storage using meter-level remotely sensed data, which often falls short of accurately capturing the water storage dynamics of OFRs, especially in small OFRs with steep slopes. Hence, we proposed a method to estimate the water storage of OFRs in irrigation areas by integrating multispectral drone data, high-resolution remote sensing data, and ground observations. The water surface area was extracted from multispectral drone data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a threshold segmentation method. Slope gradients were then obtained by identifying the maximum potential slope zone (PSZ) and utilizing highresolution drone-based Digital Surface Models (DSMs). The dam slopes of the constructed boundaries were automatically computed considering the significant decline of slope gradients. By combining the dam slopes of the OFRs with water depth observations, we estimated the construction depth (H). Subsequently, current water depth was obtained using drone-derived Digital Surface Models (DSMs), calculating the elevation difference between drone-derived OFRs and water surface boundary. Once the OFR morphology was fully constructed, the water storage was calculated based on area-storage and depth-storage methods using the 3D volume module in Arcpy. The derived water storage agrees well with in situ observation (R2: 0.99) using slope gradients, reaching an overall accuracy of 95.2 %, with a root mean square error (RMSE) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2785 m3 and 1820 m3, respectively. Notably, discernible fluctuations in water storage were observed during the main irrigation phases, highlighting the essential role of OFRs in promoting equitable water resource distribution and enhancing irrigation water management. This integrated approach offers a robust solution for monitoring and managing water storage dynamics in agricultural areas.					; zhu, weiwei/HGE-2866-2022; Ma, Zonghan/AAM-7055-2021; Wang, Yixuan/LKN-2545-2024; Wu, Bingfang/AAD-7223-2022	, wubingfang/0000-0001-5546-365X; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2025	307								109241	10.1016/j.agwat.2024.109241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2024.109241		DEC 2024											WOS:001413872100001
J	LaPerriere, JD; Edmundson, JA				LaPerriere, JD; Edmundson, JA			Limnology of two lake systems of Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska: Part II. Light penetration and Secchi depth	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seven large lakes in the Naknek River drainage and four in the Alagnak River drainage within the Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska, were surveyed once a summer during the period 1990-92 to determine baseline limnological conditions. All of the lakes are oligotrophic based on Secchi depth (SD) transparency and light penetration. Overall, SD transparency varied from 4.4 m to 17 m, the vertical light extinction coefficient (K-d) ranged from 0.411 m(-1) to 0.070 m(-1) and the depth of 1% light penetration (I-1%) varied from 11 m to 67 m. However, because of greater light scattering, the percent of photosynthetic radiation (PAR) at SD was nearly twice as much in Battle Lake (30.4%) and Naknek Lake (32.8%), compared with the other nine lakes (mean 16%). Consequently, the ratio of I-1% to SD was about 4 in these two lakes compared to a mean value of 2.6 for the other lakes. However, Battle Lake is a `deep blue' calcium sulfate lake with little phytoplankton, whereas Naknek Lake contains some inorganic glacial flour and volcanic ash, as well as planktonic algae, but where sampled exhibits minimal turbidity. Biomass of planktonic algae (indexed by total chlorophyll concentration) explained most of the variation in SD (r(2)=0.66), K-d (r(2)=0.75), and I-1% (r(2)=0.85). In contrast, neither color nor turbidity were significant predictors of any optical variable. Considering all 11 lakes, there was a significant linear relationship between SD and both K-d (r(2)=0.80) and I-1% (r(2)=0.72); however, most of the unaccounted for variation was attributed to Battle Lake and Naknek Lake. Although changes in water transparency are often linked to changes in algal biomass (chlorophyll), simple measures of SD transparency alone may not be appropriate for assessing whole-scale watershed or regional changes toward oligotrophication or eutrophication in lakes of the remote and pristine Katmai National Park and Preserve.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2000	418						209	216		10.1023/A:1003990600537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003990600537													WOS:000085998100018

The present paper intends to draw some lessons from the Project's experience in micro-projects identification and implementation, by giving an account of the events which occurred in the framework of an eco-tourism lodge and an impala ranching micro-projects, and critically reviewing discourses and practises of the various actors involved in the negotiation process. The analysis highlights some outstanding features in the social composition of two groups of inhabitants of the Valley, and shows how differently the population reacted to the Project's implementation in each context. It sheds light upon certain dynamics of power struggle at the local level, and upon the strategies that were followed by various actors to attain their objectives. Eventually, it questions the role of participatory rural appraisal and co-management methods, and their ability to both set a favourable context for local negotiation and allow the concerns of all partners to be voiced out. The paper advocates an ethic of open-mindedness, whereby development agents are cautious not to enter the sphere of political struggle and to keep open the ways of negotiation. The Mid-Zambezi Valley stretches along the northern border of Zimbabwe, from the Victoria Falls down to the Mozambican border and the Cabora Bassa lake. The Valley, in its hole, is a relatively wild area, which harbours a number of National Parks and Safari Areas, as well as some sparsely populated Communal Lands. Dande is situated in Guruve District, Mashonaland Central province, and covers a vast area running from the foot of the zambezian escarpment up to the Zambezi river and the mozambican border.																			1264-112X		2-87614-466-2				2001							31	54																WOS:000179045200004

Lake Malanzan was one of several water bodies formed in the Paganzo Basin during the Late Carboniferous deglaciation. Five sedimentary facies have been recognized. Facies A (Dropstones-bearing laminated mudstones) records deposition from suspension fall-out and probably underflow currents coupled with ice-rafting processes in a basin lake setting. Facies B (Ripple cross-laminated sandstones and siltstones) was deposited from low density turbidity currents in a lobe fringe environment. Facies C (Massive or graded sandstones) is thought to represent sedimentation from high and low density turbidity currents in sand lobes. Facies D (Folded sandstones and siltstones) was formed from slumping in proximal lobe environments. Facies E (Wave-rippled sandstones) records wave reworking of sands supplied by turbidity currents above wave base level. The Lake Malanzan succession is formed by stacked turbidite sand lobe deposits. These lobes were probably formed in proximal lacustrine settings, most likely relatively high gradient slopes. Paleocurrents indicate a dominant direction from cratonic areas to the WSW. Although the overall sequence shows a regressive trend from basin fine-grained deposits to deltaic and braided fluvial facies, individual lobe packages lack of definite vertical trends in bed thickness and grain size. This fact suggests aggradation from multiple-point sources, rather than progradation from single-point sources. Sedimentologic and paleoecologic evidence indicate high depositional rate and sediment supply. Deposition within the lake was largely dominated by event sedimentation. Low diversity trace fossil assemblages of opportunistic invertebrates indicate recolonization of event beds under stressed conditions. Three stages of lake evolutionary history have been distinguished. The vertical replacement of braided fluvial deposits by basinal facies indicates high subsidence and a lacustrine transgressive episode. This flooding event was probably linked to a notable base level rise during postglacial times. The second evolutionary stage was typified by the formation of sand turbidite lobes from downslope mass-movements. Lake history culminates with the progradation of deltaic and braided fluvial systems.																			0921-2728					JUL	1995	14	1					1	22		10.1007/BF00682591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00682591													WOS:A1995RQ66800001
J	Trewin, NH; Davidson, RG				Trewin, NH; Davidson, RG			Lake-level changes, sedimentation and faunas in a Middle Devonian basin-margin fish bed	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The classic Devonian fossil fish site at Tynet Burn, Fochabers, NE Scotland has been investigated following recent excavations. The fish assemblage consists of placoderms, acanthodians, an actinopterygian, porolepiforms, osteolepiforms and a dipnoan. The assemblage is typical of the 'Achanarras Fauna' of Eifelian age which is widespread in the Orcadian basin, representing a time of generally high lake levels. The most diverse fauna occurs in the Upper Nodule Bed which can be divided into top and bottom levels, where fish are mainly preserved in calcareous nodules, and a middle level with fish in laminated limestone. Three fluvial to lacustrine cycles are exposed in the Tynet Burn in 27 m of strata. Fish are abundant in the Upper Nodule Bed, and are also sparsely represented in lacustrine strata both above and below this level. The lacustrine laminites of the Upper Nodule Bed were deposited following a rapid rise in lake level. Subsequent fall in lake level resulted in deposition of a thin shallow water massive limestone, prior to exposure and desiccation of the lake floor. Disruption of laminites by sediment sliding and sand intrusion was followed by compaction and concretion formation. Chemotrophic bacteria later invaded open cracks and porosity and partially oxidized the fish remains; the bacterial oxidation event being responsible for the characteristic pink; red and purple colours of fossil fish from Tynet Burn. Subsequent lake level rise resulted in deposition of shales with abundant diagenetic concretions, rarely containing fish. With increasing elastic input alluvial sands prograded over the area from the south. The rapid deepening event associated with the base of the Upper Nodule Bed at Tynet is considered to be synchronous with similar events represented in other Achanarras-equivalent fish beds. However, elements of the Achanarras fish assemblage can be encountered in less persistent lacustrine intervals both above and below this level. Minor cyclicity, superimposed on the main Achanarras event, resulted in repetition of fluvial to lacustrine transitions. The main control on cyclicity is considered to have been climatic, but subsidence and sediment supply rates were also a significant influence.																			0016-7649					MAY	1999	156		3				535	548		10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0535	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0535													WOS:000080142400010

Based on the occurrence pattern of P. latirostris, most individuals begin mating as males at Age-1, followed by a sex change to females, spawn eggs as females at Age-2, and hatch their eggs in the spring of Age-3. Pre-hatching ovigerous females were mainly found in eelgrass beds near and in Lake Akkeshi, where the water temperature was rela-tively high. The females probably migrate there to hatch their eggs, making sure of the high survival and growth of the hatched larvae. Juveniles and small males were also abundant in near and in Lake Akkeshi, indicating that many larvae remained in the eelgrass beds where they hatched. These eelgrass beds play an important role in the maintenance of the shrimp population as a major egg-hatching site and nursery habitat in Akkeshi waters. With ontogenetic development, the occurrence rate of P. latirostris gradually increased on the offshore side of Akkeshi Bay, with its body size being larger. As P. latirostris grow, they will probably disperse to the offshore side of Akkeshi Bay. However, the density of P. latirostris in the eelgrass bed in the bay near the lake was extremely high, with its strong preference at all ontogenetic stages. This eelgrass bed would help maintain the shrimp population as a "key habitat" for the shrimp. The site-specific environmental characteristics of vegetation beds influence the distribution and abundance of individuals within a population of P. latirostris through their growth and the associated change in habitat preference. In this study, the importance of maintaining the diverse habitats of P. latirostris will be discussed as part of the shrimp stock management measures.

The optimum spectral conditions for the rubidium determination are as follows: wavelength, 780.0 nm; spectral bandwidth, 1.4 nm (low); absorption signal, peak area. The temperatures of ashing and atomization, and interferences of several acids and of coexisting major components to the absorbance of 10 ppb rubidium were examined. The most appropriate temperatures of ashing and atomization were found to be 400-degrees-C and 1900-degrees-C, respectively. Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid showed no significant influence on the absorbance of rubidium. The chloride interference could be suppressed by the addition of nitric acid and sodium ion into the sample solution; 0.2 mol dm-3 of nitric acid and 100 ppm of sodium ion overcame the interference up to 100 ppm of chloride. In this procedure, 20-mu-l of the sample solution was used for one measurement and five measurements were repeated for each sample. The finally determined values were the averages of three data after the highest and lowest values were excluded. Relative standard deviation was less than 1.5% (n = 40). The procedure was applied to the determination of rubidium in natural waters. Reliability of the data was examined by the addition of a certain volume of a standard rubidium solution into a natural water whose rubidium content was already determined. The amount of rubidium in the water thus formed reached 96 to 99% of what was expected from the calculation, indicating that the data are fairly reliable. As for the samples with high rubidium contents, the results determined by the present procedure were in good agreement with those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The detection limit was 0.03 ppb (S/N = 3).																			0369-4577					JAN	1992		1					118	123		10.1246/nikkashi.1992.118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1992.118													WOS:A1992HB14100019
J	TALLING, JF				TALLING, JF			PHOTOSYNTHETIC BEHAVIOUR IN STRATIFIED AND UNSTRATIFIED LAKE POPULATIONS OF A PLANKTONIC DIATOM	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Photosynthetic behavior is described for four populations of Asterionella formosa, developed as spring maxima during two successive years in two English lakes. Rates of gross phytosynthesis were determined from exposures in lake and laboratory. Their variation is described in relation to environmental factors and population density, with special attention to effects from vertical stratification. Maximum photosynthetic rates, and the light intensities required for saturation, did not differ greatly between the lakes or from corresponding features measured earlier with cultured material. The photosynthetic capacity was often lower, but still considerable, during long periods when further cell multiplication was blocked by Si depletion. The influence of temperature (5-17[degree] C) on photosynthetic rate was negligible at low intensities, but at saturating intensities an average Q10 of 2.1 was found. Vertical differentiation of population density and several physiological characteristics developed rapidly after thermal stratification in the lakes. The physiological differentiation was chiefly controlled by light, and is interpreted in terms of "sun" and "shade" behavior plus effects of illumination on cells in a silica-deficient medium. Deeper cells showed an increased content of chlorophyll a, a decreased carotenoid/chlorophyll a ratio, and contracted chromatophores; their photosynthesis usually reached light-saturation at slightly lower intensities and was more susceptible to depression at high intensities. Dark pretreatments of surface samples could often reduce their carotenoid content and sometimes increase their photosynthetic capacity. Reductions in capacity at light saturation, and in population density, often contributed to the decline of photosynthetic capacity or pigments was not certainly found. The depth-distribution of photosynthetic activity in stratified populations could be assessed from the distribution of photosynthetic capacity per unit water volume, which was strongly correlated with population density, and depth-profiles of relative rates of photosynthesis obtained from homogeneous material. Other effects from physiological differentiation with depth were of secondary importance for photosynthetic productivity.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1966	54	1					99	+		10.2307/2257661	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2257661													WOS:A19667580100006

Many of the streams have abundant perennial mats of filamentous cyanobacteria. The algal mats grow during streamflow in the austral summer and are in a dormant freeze-dried state during the rest of the year. NO3 and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were lower in streams with abundant algal mats than in streams with sparse algal mats. NO3 and SRP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone of a stream with abundant algal mats than in the stream itself. An experimental injection of LiCl, NaNO3, and K3PO4 was conducted in Green Creek, which has abundant algal mats. Substantial hyporheic exchange occurred. The NO3 and PO4 concentrations at 50 m below the injection were 55 muM and 18 muM, respectively, during the experiment. NO3 and PO4 concentrations were below the detection limit of 1 to 2 muM at a site 497 m below the injection during the Cl tracer arrival, indicating a high capacity for nutrient uptake by algal communities. NO2 and NH4 were present at sites 226 and 327 m below the injection, indicating that, in addition to denitrification and algal uptake, dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NO2 and NH4 may be a NO3 sink during transport. Transport modelling with nutrient uptake represented as a 1(st)-order process yielded reach-scale parameters of 4.3 x 10(-5) to 3.9 x 10(-4)/s and 1.4 x 10(-4) to 3.8 x 10(-1)/s for uptake of NO3 and PO4, respectively. The best match with the observed data was a model in which PO4 uptake occurred only in the main channel and NO3 uptake occurred in the main channel and in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic NO3 uptake was 7 to 16% of the total uptake for the different stream reaches. These results demonstrate that nutrient flux to the lakes is controlled by hyporheic exchange and nutrient uptake by algal mats in dry valley streams. Streams without algal mats contribute more nutrients to the lakes than streams with algal mats.

The River Marta, outlet of the Lake Bolsena, presents along its master course five hydroelectric power stations and the waste of some towns and little industries. The groundwater resources have been extracted from several wells. In addition, the basin is characterized by some areas of environmental value. The analysis included the collection of the streamflow records of the River Marta, new measurements of the streamflow, processing of the meteorological data and acquisition of the data concerning wells and springs. It emerged that the streamflow is fed from groundwater, being the river the main discharge of the volcanic aquifer, as well as from the effluent of the Lake Bolsena and surface runoff. Afirst average annual evaluation of the water budget of the basin points to an amount of water resources of about 200x10(6) m(3)/year, among which 51% is constituted by effective infiltration, 30% by surface runoff and 19% by groundwater inflow from outside the watershed. The flow leaving the system discharges mainly in the river. Actual water loss from the system is constituted by the withdrawals for irrigation (about 20% of the overall water resources). The determination of the instream flow of the River Marta applied to some significant sections with different methods leads to various values. The experience showed that the evaluation of instream flow cannot be based only on the investigation of the watercourse. The whole hydrogeological system connected with the river must be considered too, particularly when the river is fed from groundwater. It is necessary to take into consideration not only the direct withdrawals from the river but also the pumping from the aquifer which impoverishes the river baseflow.																			1825-6635	2035-5688					2008					SI		37	55		10.4408/IJEGE.2008-01.S-03	http://dx.doi.org/10.4408/IJEGE.2008-01.S-03													WOS:000420435300004

As one of warming contributors, atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) remains limited scientific understanding in the HTP due to a scarcity of observations. In this study, we present a study of the light-absorbing properties of methanol-soluble brown carbon (MeS-BrC) and water-soluble brown carbon (WS-BrC) during 2018-2021. Highly spatiotemporal variations of BrC light absorptions were observed. In the HTP marginal area, elevated BrC absorption coefficients at 365 nm (babs,365) and levoglucosan concentrations were obtained, and MeS-BrC exhibits approximately 1.3-1.8 times higher absorption compared to WS-BrC. We determined that BrC light absorptions was largely attributed to biomass burning (29%-35%). BrC can act as a potent warming agent in the HTP marginal area, with high direct solar absorption (25%-47% relative to black carbon). Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) remains low scientific understanding in the HTP due to a scarcity of observations. Here, we present a plateau-scale study of the light-absorbing properties of methanol-soluble brown carbon (MeS-BrC) and water-soluble brown carbon (WS-BrC) during the period of 2018-2021. This study highlights the contribution of BrC to the HTP warming. Higher BrC light absorption was observed in the HTP marginal area compared with the central HTP. Enhanced radiative absorption effect of WS-BrC was obtained in the HTP, with an annual average of similar to 25% compared with BC in Qinghai Lake and Ngari, and as high as 46.5% in Purang. The results confirmed the importance of BrC from biomass burning in contributing to light-absorbing aerosols in this region.

EBEITY LAKE, RUSSIA: CHEMICAL-ORGANIC AND MINERAL COMPOSITION OF WATER AND BOTTOM SEDIMENTS	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is caused by the need to study and monitor the ecological and geochemical status of a complex mineral salt deposit of Ebeity Lake. The total industrial reserves of sodium sulfate (mirabilite) in the lake water are 36,89 million tons. In addition, this lake is of interest as a deposit of therapeutic mud, as well as the crustaceans Artemia Salina L. and their cysts. The aim of the study is to determine the main features of macro-, micro- component, organic and mineral composition of the lake Ebeity, as well as to determine the hydrogeochemical processes affecting the distribution of organomineral complexes of elements. Research methods. The lake was studied in summer 2015. The lake and porous waters, as well as bottom sediments were analysed using mass spectral methods, as well as the methods of atomic absorption, flame emission, potentiometry, titration, etc. The study of bottom sediments was also carried out using the X-ray powder diffractometry method with mandatory control of the composition of typical solid samples by X-ray fluorescent analysis using synchrotron radiation with registration on a Si (Li) detector. The results of the studies showed that Ebeity Lake refers to the SO4-Cl-Na composition, the pH of the lake during the sampling period was 5,7, the lake was characterised by anoxic condition. The pore waters of bottom sediments do not differ from the lake water in their major composition, but the concentrations of trace elements are 2-8 times higher than the values in the lake. The study of complexation of elements in lake water shown that most of iron, copper, uranium and thorium is bound to a high molecular organic matter that allows presuming the impossibility of formation of such minerals as goethite, chlorite and Cu (met), obtained during thermodynamic calculations. The results obtained at simulation allowed us to construct a sequence of formation of evaporite minerals in the lake: Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O+Na2Ca(SO4)(2)-> Na2SO4+Na4Ca(SO4)(3 ->)2H(2)O -> NaCl+Na4Mg(SO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O. A study of the mineral composition of bottom sediments showed the presence in solid phase of quartz as the main phase, impurities of NaCl, small admixtures of potassium feldspars, plagioclase, and calcite. The salt along the lake and at the bottom is represented by thenardite, a small-medium amount of halite and traces of astrakhanite.

At the same time, they represent a primary biological compartment in diversity and abundance in these hypero-ligotrophic environments forcing organisms to extreme living conditions. Also, Pave lake, located at 2840 m in the National Park of Ecrins (South of France), appeared to us as an exciting subject to study the first lifeforms in a recent alpine lake. Our samples revealed several remarkable species according to their scarcity in the literature [Nitzschia alpina Hustedt, Encyonema brevicapitatum Krammer and Cymbella parva (W.Smith) Kirchner] and other species still undetermined (Nitzschia sp. aff. frustulum, Nitzschia cf. fonticola). The great species diversity of Achnanthidium Kutzing led us to disentangle the Achnanthidium minutissimum species complex collected in our samples. The present paper aims at clarifying the Achnanthidium community recorded in the Lake Pave. In a first step, the main outcome is the recognition of two species that could not be identified with currently available literature. After comparison with similar taxa and a thorough morphological analysis based on detailed LM and SEM observations, they are described as Achnanthidium pavense sp. nov. and Achnanthidium ecrinense sp. nov. In a second step, through our paper we wish to clarify the identity of Achnanthidim minutissimum sensu stricto based on already published illustrations of type material of taxa and the morphological criteria observed in the Pave Lake population. Addi-tionally we illustrate three other Achnanthidium species also found in the lake, A. lineare W.Smith, A. sublineare Van de Vijver, Jarlman & Ector and A. hoffmannii Van de Vijver, Ector, Mertens & Jarlman, and, finally, the ecology and bio-indication meanings of these species belonging to the Achnanthidium minutissimum complex are given. According to the ecological preferences of the associated flora in the type sample, the two new species should be considered as biological indicators of environmental conditions specific to Alpine stage.					; Wetzel, Carlos/A-2839-2015	HEUDRE, David/0009-0003-5134-5332; 													0029-5035	2363-7188				DEC	2023	117	1-4					143	163		10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2023/0852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2023/0852		NOV 2023											WOS:001101153900001

Lingering legacies: Past growth and parental experience influence somatic growth in a fish population	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Body size and growth rate can influence individual and population success by mediating fitness. Understanding the factors that influence growth can be difficult to disentangle, however, because growth can be shaped by environmental conditions recently experienced, as well as legacy effects from conditions experienced earlier in life and by parents (via parental effects). 2. To improve understanding of growth among annual cohorts (1982-2015) of Lake Erie Walleye (Sander vitreus), a species with life-history and growth characteristics similar to many other long-lived, iteroparous fishes, we determined the role of the following hypothesised factors: (H1) recent environmental conditions; (H2) traits and experiences of the cohort, including growth, in the previous year; (H3) early-life cohort density; (H4) early-life body size; and (H5) parental composition and environment. We evaluated the relative importance of these hypothesised factors using piecewise structural equation modelling in an information-theoretic framework. 3. Our results indicated that cohort-specific growth of Lake Erie Walleye was most strongly influenced by traits (growth) and experiences of the cohort during the previous year (H2) and parental composition and environment (H5). The observed negative relationship with growth during the previous year may indicate that Walleye exhibit compensatory growth. The relationships with parental sizes and environments may mean that parental contributions to offspring affects cohorts into adulthood, with serious implications for the effects of climate change. Warm winters appear to negatively influence offspring growth performance for many years. 4. Legacy effects had a stronger influence on cohort growth than recent environmental conditions, providing new understanding of how somatic growth is regulated in Lake Erie's Walleye population. Specifically, the parental composition and environment appear important via epigenetic and/or egg-provisioning legacies, with carryover effects modifying growth among years. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that understanding recent growth in animal populations similar to Lake Erie Walleye may require knowledge of past conditions, including those experienced by parents.					; Marschall, Elizabeth/A-1608-2014; Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010	Almeida, Leah/0000-0003-0280-5964; Marschall, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8026-4203; 													0021-8790	1365-2656				OCT	2024	93	10					1462	1474		10.1111/1365-2656.14143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14143		AUG 2024						39138820					WOS:001290849700001

Conduct of a Reservoir Multimetric Bioassessment to Address a Clean Water Act Section 316(a) Demonstration for Georgia Power Company's Plant Branch, Lake Sinclair, Georgia	BALANCING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND WATER USES FOR IMPOUNDED RIVER SYSTEMS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				4th North American Reservoir Symposium on Balancing Fisheries Management and Water Uses for Impounded River Systems	JUN 07-09, 2007	Atlanta, GA	Amer Fisheries Soc, SE Div Reservoir Comm				A multimetric reservoir bioassessment was conducted on Lake Sinclair, a 6,204-ha Multipurpose impoundment in central Georgia in 2002. This bioassessment was the first application of such techniques or) a reservoir in Georgia and was an integral component of a Clean Water Act Section 316(a) demonstration. Findings from this project were used to support a request for a thermal variance for the Plant Branch heated discharge. Plant Branch is an electric generating facility that withdraws water from Lake Sinclair for cooling purposes and discharges heated effluent to the reservoir under the authority of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. A new cooling tower system began operation in 2002 and was designed to remove approximately 50% of the thermal Output from the plant during summer months. Subsequently, the bioassessment was conducted to determine if a balanced, indigenous aquatic community is protected and maintained in the thermally influenced portion of Lake Sinclair. Detailed habitat characterization was performed within thermally influenced areas (Primary Study Area [PSA]) and references areas of the lake to identify major habitat types and select comparable sampling sites. Fish Community sampling was conducted on a seasonal and spatial basis via nighttime electrofishing, experimental-mesh gill netting, and seining within the PSA and comparable sites outside of thermally influenced areas (reference areas). Hydroacoustic surveys were also conducted to assess abundance, vertical and longitudinal distributions, and movement of limnetic fishes reservoir-wide and in response to the thermal discharge. The macroinvertebrate community was sampled seasonally using Hester-Dendy artificial substrate samplers, dip nets, and petite Ponar grab samplers in littoral/sublittoral zones in the PSA (8 sites) and in the reference areas (16 sites). The condition of the Primary Study Area biological community was scored against the reference condition in Lake Sinclair as a measure of the expected, best attainable condition in the absence of thermal influences related to Plant Branch. Based on site-specific biotic integrity classifications developed for Lake Sinclair, the Primary Study Area metric scores determined for critical summertime conditions (index period) totaled 53 points for the macroinvertebrate community and 43 points for the fish community (each score based on a 60-point scale), equating to integrity classifications of "Very Good" and "Good," respectively. This indicated that conditions in the Primary Study Area were comparable to those found in the reference areas of the reservoir. Results of this bioassessment demonstrated that the protection and propagation of a balanced, indigenous aquatic community is being maintained in the thermally influenced Primary Study Area of Lake Sinclair. Notably, such conditions were Supported during a time of extended drought, above normal air temperatures, and high electrical demand. Thus, the bioassessment indicated that operation of the Plant Branch facility does not have an appreciable impact on the biological community of Lake Sinclair.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-06-6				2008	62						655	680																WOS:000263597300043

Special focus was on past vegetation and on the history of Pinus rotundata in relation to anthropogenic and climatic influences. Testate amoebae were used to reconstruct past local soil pH and water-table depth. The inferred development of the Praz-Rodet bog typifies a classic hydroseral terrestrialization of a small basin. Two features are specific for this site. First, the bog was much wetter than today for a long period; according to our hypothesis, this only changed as a consequence of human activities. Second, two hiatuses are present at the coring location (Younger Dryas-early Preboreal, and 4700-2800 cal. yr BP), the former probably caused by low lake productivity due to cold temperatures and the latter by the erosional activity of the adjacent small river. The date of 2800 cal. yr BP for renewed peat accumulation may be related to climatic change (Subboreal-Subatlantic transition). Pollen indicators failed to show one hiatus: an apparently complete pollen sequence is therefore no guarantee of an uninterrupted sediment accumulation. Evidence of early minor human impact on the vegetation in the Joux Valley dates back to c. 6850 calendar years, congruous with the early Neolithic in the Jura Mountains. The history of Pious rotundata appears to be more complex than previously believed. Human activity is clearly responsible for the present abundance of this species, but the tree was naturally present on the bog long before the first evidence of important human disturbance of the site (1500 cal. yr BP). It is suggested that, in karst-dominated landscapes, dense forests growing on mineral soils around raised bogs may significantly reduce summer evapotranspiration by acting as windbreaks. Forest clearance results in increased evapotranspiration, causing a lowering of the water table on the bog and a modification of the vegetation cover. This hypothesis has implications for the management of similar small raised bogs in karst-dominated landscape.

Despite previous reports on the microbial community dynamics of ice-covered lakes in this region, there is a paucity of information on the relationship between microbial genomic diversity and associated nutrient cycling. Here, we applied gene- and genome-centric approaches to investigate the microbial ecology and reconstruct microbial metabolic potential along the depth gradient in Lake Bonney.ResultsLake Bonney is strongly chemically stratified with three distinct redox zones, yielding different microbial niches. Our genome enabled approach revealed that in the sunlit and relatively freshwater epilimnion, oxygenic photosynthetic production by the cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena and a diversity of protists and microalgae may provide new organic carbon to the environment. CO-oxidizing bacteria, such as Acidimicrobiales, Nanopelagicales, and Burkholderiaceae were also prominent in the epilimnion and their ability to oxidize carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide may serve as a supplementary energy conservation strategy. In the more saline metalimnion of ELB, an accumulation of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus supports photosynthesis despite relatively low light levels. Conversely, in WLB the release of organic rich subglacial discharge from Taylor Glacier into WLB would be implicated in the possible high abundance of heterotrophs supported by increased potential for glycolysis, beta-oxidation, and glycoside hydrolase and may contribute to the growth of iron reducers in the dark and extremely saline hypolimnion of WLB. The suboxic and subzero temperature zones beneath the metalimnia in both lobes supported microorganisms capable of utilizing reduced nitrogens and sulfurs as electron donors. Heterotrophs, including nitrate reducing sulfur oxidizing bacteria, such as Acidimicrobiales (MAG72) and Salinisphaeraceae (MAG109), and denitrifying bacteria, such as Gracilimonas (MAG7), Acidimicrobiales (MAG72) and Salinisphaeraceae (MAG109), dominated the hypolimnion of WLB, whereas the environmental harshness of the hypolimnion of ELB was supported by the relatively low in metabolic potential, as well as the abundance of halophile Halomonas and endospore-forming Virgibacillus.ConclusionsThe vertical distribution of microbially driven C, N and S cycling genes/pathways in Lake Bonney reveals the importance of geochemical gradients to microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycles with the vertical water column.

J	Syvitski, J; Normandeau, A; Lajeunesse, P				Syvitski, Jaia; Normandeau, Alexandre; Lajeunesse, Patrick			Major Holocene glacio-isostatically-induced earthquakes triggered mass-transport deposits and seabed displacements in Lake Melville	MARINE GEOLOGY												The character and history of post-depositional structures within Lake Melville, Labrador, Canada, is investigated from a geohazard and sedimentary process perspective. Large Holocene earthquakes during glacio-isostatic recovery generated large (up to 3.1 km(3)) contemporaneous failures across up to 7 separated basins, and earthquake-related markers including vents, pockmarks, diapirs, stratigraphic offsets, and massive liquefaction fronts. Epicenter locations within Lake Melville are identified for three similar to 7 + ML magnitude Holocene earthquakes. Deposits include a massive 3.1 km(3) turbidite MT event at similar to 7 + 0.3 kyr BP, the up to 1.1 km(3) mega debris flow DF1 event at similar to 6 + 0.2 kyr BP, and the equally large 1750 + 50 CE DF2 event. Mega-debris flow theory is revised to include seafloor liquefaction beneath the path of the mass flow, debris-flow bulking by incorporating underlying sediments, and shock-front compression for failures with large drop heights. During the DF1 event, 68 km(2) of the seafloor collapsed forming fault-strike mega-pockmarks or vents, with 40 % contemporaneously buried by mega debris flows. The collapse volume is associated with similar to 5000 large sand or mud diapirs (similar to 0.2 Gt) at a spatial density of 5 + per km(2) across well-separated basins. The DF2 event created a 0.11 km(3) prodelta channel that since 1750 CE serves largely as a bypass zone for a growing 0.01 km(3) sandy turbidite fan. Lake Melville's tendency towards thixotropic sediment failure reflects high basin-filling accumulation rates (3+ cm per yr) and the presence of buried and over-pressured low-cohesion sandy-silt layers. Mega debris flows in Lake Melville remobilized and entrained substrate during transport, more than doubling their original failure volume. Tsunami wave amplitude predictions may be over-estimated by up to 75 %, if incorrectly based on deposit volume rather than the originating slope failure. Maximum tsunamis amplitude estimates for Lake Melville fall between similar to 23 m and similar to 69 m.

Geochemical and biochemical evidence of lake overturn and fish kill at Lake Averno, Italy	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Lake Averno is situated in the homonymous crater in the northwestern sector of the Campi Flegrei active volcanic system in Campania region, Italy. In February 2005 a fish kill event was observed in the lake, prompting a geochemical survey to ascertain the possible cause. In February 2005 a geochemical survey revealed that the lake water was unstratified chemically and isotopically, presumably, as a result of lake overturn. This fish kill phenomenon was recorded at least two other times in the past. In contrast to the February 2005 results, data collected in October 2005, shows the Lake Averno to be stratified, with an oxic epilimnion (surface to 6 m) and an anoxic hypolimnion (6 m to lake bottom at about 33 m). Chemical and isotopic compositions of Lake Averno waters suggest an origin by mixing of shallow waters with a Na-Cl hydrothermal component coupled with an active evaporation process. The isotopic composition of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon, as well as the composition of the non-reactive dissolved gas species again supports the occurrence of this mixing process. Decreasing levels Of SO4 and increasing levels of H2S and CH4 contents in lake water with depth, strongly suggests anaerobic bacterial processes are occurring through decomposition of organic matter under anoxic conditions in the sediment and in the water column. Sulfate reduction and methanogenesis processes coexist and play a pivotal role in the anaerobic environment of the Lake Averno. The sulfate reducing bacterial activity has been estimated in the range of 14-22 mu mol m(-2) day(-1). Total gas pressure of dissolved gases ranges between 800 and 1400 mbar, well below the hydrostatic pressure throughout the water column, excluding the possibility, at least at the survey time, of a limnic eruption. Vertical changes in the density of lake waters indicate that overturn may be triggered by cooling of epilimnetic waters below 7 degrees C. This is a possible phenomenon in winter periods if atmospheric temperatures remain frosty for enough time, as occurred in February 2005. The bulk of these results strongly support the hypothesis that fish kill was caused by a series of events that began with the cooling of the epilimnetic waters with breaking of the thermal stratification, followed by lake overturn and the rise of toxic levels of H2S from the reduced waters near the lake bottom.

J	Panis, F; Rompel, A				Panis, Felix; Rompel, Annette			The Novel Role of Tyrosinase Enzymes in the Storage of Globally Significant Amounts of Carbon in Wetland Ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Over the last millennia, wetlands have been sequestering carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis at a higher rate than releasing it and, therefore, have globally accumulated 550 x 1015 g of carbon, which is equivalent to 73% of the atmospheric carbon pool. The accumulation of organic carbon in wetlands is effectuated by phenolic compounds, which suppress the degradation of soil organic matter by inhibiting the activity of organic-matter-degrading enzymes. The enzymatic removal of phenolic compounds by bacterial tyrosinases has historically been blocked by anoxic conditions in wetland soils, resulting from waterlogging. Bacterial tyrosinases are a subgroup of oxidoreductases that oxidatively remove phenolic compounds, coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The biochemical properties of bacterial tyrosinases have been investigated thoroughly in vitro within recent decades, while investigations focused on carbon fluxes in wetlands on a macroscopic level have remained a thriving yet separated research area so far. In the wake of climate change, however, anoxic conditions in wetland soils are threatened by reduced rainfall and prolonged summer drought. This potentially allows tyrosinase enzymes to reduce the concentration of phenolic compounds, which in turn will increase the release of stored carbon back into the atmosphere. To offer compelling evidence for the novel concept that bacterial tyrosinases are among the key enzymes influencing carbon cycling in wetland ecosystems first, bacterial organisms indigenous to wetland ecosystems that harbor a TYR gene within their respective genome (tyr(+)) have been identified, which revealed a phylogenetically diverse community of tyr(+ )bacteria indigenous to wetlands based on genomic sequencing data. Bacterial TYR host organisms covering seven phyla (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Proteobacteria) have been identified within various wetland ecosystems (peatlands, marshes, mangrove forests, bogs, and alkaline soda lakes) which cover a climatic continuum ranging from high arctic to tropic ecosystems. Second, it is demonstrated that (in vitro) bacterial TYR activity is commonly observed at pH values characteristic for wetland ecosystems (ranging from pH 3.5 in peatlands and freshwater swamps to pH 9.0 in soda lakes and freshwater marshes) and toward phenolic compounds naturally present within wetland environments (p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, and epicatechin). Third, analyzing the available data confirmed that bacterial host organisms tend to exhibit in vitro growth optima at pH values similar to their respective wetland habitats. Based on these findings, it is concluded that, following increased aeration of previously anoxic wetland soils due to climate change, TYRs are among the enzymes capable of reducing the concentration of phenolic compounds present within wetland ecosystems, which will potentially destabilize vast amounts of carbon stored in these ecosystems. Finally, promising approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of increased TYR activity in wetland ecosystems and the requirement of future investigations of the abundance and activity of TYRs in an environmental setting are presented.

J	Kaupp, H; McLachlan, MS				Kaupp, H; McLachlan, MS			Distribution of polychlorinated dibenzo-P-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within the full size range of atmospheric particles	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Particle size distributions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured at a rural location in northeastern Bavaria during summer. The complete size range of the atmospheric particles was sampled using cascade impactors and a rotary impactor. On an average 92% of the hepta- and octachlorinated PCDD/Fs and 97% of the PAHs with five or more rings, which were all more or less completely particle bound in the atmosphere, were associated with particles with aerodynamic diameters (d(ae)) < 2.9 mu m. The substance loading decreased steadily with increasing particle size. On average only 3.4 and 1.2% of the Cl7-8DD/F and the PAHs with five or more rings, respectively, were found on large particles with d(ae) > 8.6 mu m. The temporal variation of the size distributions was low. Despite similar measured size distributions the washout ratios of the PCDD/Fs and PAHs calculated using simultaneously collected precipitation samples were different, with those of the PAHs lying consistently lower than those of the PCDD/Fs. This may have been due to differences in the particle size distributions which were not resolved with the impactors used. In the case of the semivolatile compounds for which significant fractions were present in the gas phase, 60-95% of the particle bound substance mass was always found on particles with d(ae) < 2.9 mu m. However, the concentrations did not decrease continuously with increasing particle size. Rather, increased shares were found in the particle size range 0.95-2.9 mu m for the PAHs and 8.6-26 mu m d(ae) for both the PCDD/Fs and the PAHs. It is proposed that the secondary maxima in the 8.6-26 mu m size range are attributable to resuspended biogenic material that had accumulated the contaminants from the gas phase, whereas the high levels of the semivolatile PAHs in the 0.95-2.9 mu m size range were due to combustion source characteristics. reserved.

A flow-through wetland system was constructed consisting of ten 15- X 76-m unlined cells that were continuously flooded and planted with either a monotype or combination of plants, including sturdy bulrush [Schoenoplectus robustus (Pursh) M.T. Strong], baltic rush (Juncus balticus Willd.), smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.), rabbitsfoot grass [Potypogon monspeliensis (L.) Desf.], salt-grass [Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene], cattail (Typha latifolia L.), tule [Schoenoplectus acutus (Muhl. ex Bigelow) A. Love & D. Love], and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima L.). One cell had no vegetation planted. The objectives of this research were to evaluate Se removal efficiency of each wetland cell and to carry out a mass balance on Se. The inflow drainage water to the cells had average annual Se concentrations of 19 to 22 mug L-1 dominated by selenate [Se(VI), 95%]. Average weekly water residence time varied from about 3 to 15 d for Cells I through 7 (target 7 d), 19 to 33 d for Cells 8 and 9 (target 21 d), and 13 to 18 d for Cell 10 (target 14 d). Average weekly Se concentration ratios of outflow to inflow ranged from 0.45 to 0.79 and mass ratio (concentration X water volume) from 0.24 to 0.52 for year 2000, that is, 21 to 55% reduction in Se concentration and 48 to 76% Se removal in mass by the wetland, respectively. The nonvege-tated cell showed the least Se removal both in concentration and in mass. The global mass balance showed that on the average about 59% of the total inflow Se was retained within the cells and Se outputs were outflow (35%), seepage (4%), and volatilization (2%). Independent measurements of the Se retained in the cells totaled 53% of the total Se inflow: 33% in the surface (0-20 cm) sediment, 18% in the organic detrital layer above the sediment, 2% in the fallen litter, <1% in the standing plants, and <1% in the surface water. Thus, about 6% of the total Se inflow was unaccounted for in the internal compartments.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2003	32	4					1557	1570		10.2134/jeq2003.1557	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2003.1557								12931913					WOS:000184099800044
J	Bertolo, A; Lacroix, G; Lescher-Moutoué, F				Bertolo, A; Lacroix, G; Lescher-Moutoué, F			Scaling food chains in aquatic mesocosms: do the effects of depth override the effects of planktivory?	OECOLOGIA												To assess the effects of physical dimension and planktivorous fish on phytoplankton standing crop, we repeated an experiment at different scales in plastic enclosures during summer 1995 in Lake Creteil, France. Enclosures were scaled for a constant surface (1.5 x 1.5 m) as depth was increased from 2.5 to 4.5 m. Even-link (zooplankton and phytoplankton) and odd-link (planktivorous fish, zooplankton and phytoplankton) food webs were established in both shallow and deep enclosures. Fish densities in the deep enclosures were scaled to allow comparisons with shallow ones for both in individuals m(-2) or individuals m(-3). We explicitly designed this experiment to examine the scale-dependent behavior of the top-down mechanism of algal biomass control in lakes, and in particular to test the hypothesis of stronger cascading effects of fish on lower trophic levels at reduced depth. Both fish and enclosure size had highly significant effects on phytoplankton biomass over the duration of the experiment. No depth x fish interaction effects were observed. The presence of planktivorous fish enhanced phytoplankton biomass in both shallow and deep enclosures, although the reduction in depth generally produced a stronger effect. The mean concentration of chlorophyll a in the deep odd-link systems (ca 5 mg m(-3)) was lower than in the shallow even-link systems (ca 17 mg m(-3)). Statistical interpretation did not change when data were expressed as phytoplankton biomass per unit of surface area. Light limitation and zooplankton grazing are the most probable mechanisms explaining our results in these nutrient-enriched systems. Moreover, we found that the strength of the cascading effect of fish on plankton was not a function of depth. We believe that further studies on scaling effects should be conducted in order to improve our understanding of ecological patterns and to extrapolate results from micro/mesocosms to natural ecosystems.

Transmission Dynamics of Schistosoma japonicum in the Lakes and Marshlands of China	PLOS ONE												Background: Schistosoma japonicum is a major public health concern in China, with over one million people infected and another 40 million living in areas at risk of infection. Unlike the disease caused by S. mansoni and S. haematobium, schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis, involving a number of different mammalian species as reservoir hosts. As a result of a number of published reports from China, it has long been considered that bovines, particularly water buffaloes, play a major role in human S. japonicum transmission there, and a drug-based intervention study (1998-2003) around the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province provided proof of concept that water buffaloes are, indeed, major reservoirs of human infection in this setting. Methods and Findings: In this study we incorporated recently obtained epidemiological information to model the steady-state S. japonicum transmission as well as the impact of the removal of S. japonicum transmission attributable to water buffaloes on human infection rates across six different endemic scenarios within three villages in the Dongting (Hunan) and Poyang (Jiangxi) lakes of southern China. Similar results were obtained for all scenarios. Steady-state S. japonicum infection rates remained constant and human prevalence and incidence were predicted to fall considerably over time. The model showed that the contribution of S. japonicum water buffalo transmission to human infection ranged from 39.1% to 99.1% and predicted that the removal of water buffalo transmission would reduce parasite reproductive rates below 1. This indicates that without the contribution of water buffaloes, S. japonicum transmission is interrupted and unsustainable. These scenarios are generalizable to other endemic villages in the lake and marshland areas of China where a similar cycle of snail infection and infection/reinfection of humans and bovines occurs. Conclusions: Along with previous epidemiological data, our findings strongly support water buffaloes as an important component of the transmission cycle that affects humans in the lake and marshlands region of China, a feature which appears to differ from the situation prevalent in the Philippines where their contribution is less pronounced. Our conclusions underscore the rationale for removal, replacement or treatment of water buffaloes, and for the development and deployment of a transmission blocking buffalo vaccine against S. japonicum for this setting to achieve the goal of transmission control. The Chinese Government has recently commenced a new integrated national strategy to improve on existing approaches to control schistosomiasis in the lake and marshlands region by reducing bovines and humans as a source of S. japonicum infection to Oncomelania snails.					; Williams, Gail/S-8833-2019; McManus, Don/AAC-5394-2020; Gray, Darren/A-8455-2011	Williams, Gail/0000-0002-4822-5263; McManus, Donald/0000-0001-6443-1449; Gray, Darren/0000-0003-3525-1339; 													1932-6203					DEC 30	2008	3	12							e4058	10.1371/journal.pone.0004058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004058								19115007					WOS:000265466300004

The predicted result would be a reduced abundance of the Copepod-transmitted cestode Triaenophorus crassus in whitefish, but an increase in the abundance of the nematode Cystidicola farionis transmitted via benthic amphipods. We studied the occurrence of both parasites in whitefish during 1991-1996 in three interconnected areas at Lake Saimaa, Finland, where the densities of the vendace stocks varied due to natural fluctuation in year-class strengths. In accordance with our hypothesis, some indication of the effect of the density of the vendace population on abundance of C. farionis infection in whitefish was found, but not in the case of T. crassus. Only 0.2% of vendace were infected with T. crassus, while up to 100% of the whitefish in the yearly samples harboured the parasite. In further experiments we clarified which copepod species in Lake Saimaa act as first intermediate hosts of T. cl crassus, and verified from stomach samples the exposure of both whitefish and vendace to those species. Experimental infections indicated that the infectivity of T. crassus is lower for vendace than for whitefish. We suggest that the reason why vendace stock density does not affect T. crassus infection in whitefish is that T, crassus is transmitted in littoral areas during a short period in spring. At that time of the year copepods are abundant and available to both whitefish and vendace, but since the parasite is less infective to vendace, they do not become infected. At other times of the year, dense vendace stocks may force whitefish to shift to benthic food, which includes amphipods transmitting C. farionis. During vendace stock decline, whitefish may, however, continue to feed on plankton and avoid exposure to C. farionis. (C) 1999 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Reservoir water levels do not influence daily mass gain of warblers at a riparian stopover site	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Hydroelectric dam operations that lead to fluctuations in the water levels of reservoirs can influence the amount of riparian habitat available for migrating songbirds and may impact the use and quality of remaining habitat. Our objective was to determine if use of riparian habitats and mass gain by five warbler species at the Columbia River-Revelstoke Migration Monitoring Station in British Columbia, Canada, were influenced by water levels in the surrounding Arrow Lakes Reservoir. We analyzed fall migration data collected from 1998 to 2006. Capture rates of American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla), Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas), Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata), Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), and Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) varied between years and weeks of the migration period, but were not affected by annual or weekly variation in water levels. Annual variation in capture rates was driven by hatch-year birds (> 80% of individuals captured were juveniles) and could reflect conditions on the breeding grounds that influence productivity. We found that mass gain by the five species of warblers varied between 0.32% and 0.98% of lean body mass/hour. Mass gain did not vary between years or across weeks of the migration period and was not influenced by annual or weekly variation in reservoir water levels. Although the amount of available riparian habitat was reduced when reservoir water levels were high, we found no evidence that this loss of habitat influenced either the number of warblers or the mass gain of warblers using the riparian habitat that remained. Body mass at the time of first capture varied between years and across weeks for all five species. For American Redstarts and Orange-crowned Warblers, body mass declined as average weekly water levels increased, a pattern that could arise if water levels influenced either their settlement decisions or length of stay.

Through this analysis, we provide insight into how these iconic ecosystems may respond to future ash-fall events under anticipated changes to climate and burning regimes. Location Lago Cilantro is a small lake located in south-central Chile (38 degrees 51 ' 36.72 S, 71 degrees 17 ' 14.52 W, 1,400 m asl), proximal to several active volcanos within the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes Mountain range. Taxon Araucaria araucana (Araucariaceae); Nothofagus spp. (Nothofagaceae). Methods We developed a continuous 8,700-year long pollen and charcoal record from Lago Cilantro. We compared these results with proxies of regional climatic change and used a combination of principal component analysis and superposed epoch analysis to test the relationship between tephra deposition and pollen composition. Results We detect a shift in dominance from Araucaria araucana to Nothofagus species between similar to 8.7 and similar to 5.5 ka (ka = 1,000 years before present-1950 CE), in concert with increasing regional precipitation and decreasing local-scale fire activity. A reversal in this trend occurred after similar to 4 ka, contemporaneous with a reduction in regional precipitation. Centennial-scale increases in Araucaria araucana from similar to 0.2 to 0.9 ka, similar to 5.2 to 4.2 ka and similar to 8.6 to 7 ka are associated with reductions in fire return intervals. We found 24 tephra layers in this record; tephra >2 cm thickness are associated with short-term (<100 year) compositional shifts in the pollen spectra, while a single large (255 cm) tephra at similar to 3 ka is associated with a substantial reduction in Nothofagus and no change in Araucaria. Main Conclusions Climate change drove millennial-scale shifts in Araucaria-Nothofagus forests and fire regimes near Lago Cilantro. A shortening of the fire return interval is associated with an increase in the importance of Araucaria, supporting the notion that recurrent fires are required to allow this tree species to compete with Nothofagus. Tephra deposition triggered short-term compositional responses in this system that appears to be overwhelmed by climate and fire at longer time-scales. Araucaria araucana can survive and potentially outcompete Nothofagus following the deposition of very thick tephra, thanks to its thick bark and tall canopy (>15 m).					; Moreno, Patricio/D-2317-2012; Fletcher, Michael-Shawn/AFR-2451-2022	Fletcher, Michael-Shawn/0000-0002-1854-5629; Hall, Tegan/0000-0002-2072-241X; Moreno, Patricio/0000-0002-1333-6238; 													0305-0270	1365-2699				MAR	2021	48	3					537	547		10.1111/jbi.14017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14017		NOV 2020											WOS:000594933100001

Due to their natural features such as reduction of the land fill, they may cumulate organic matter from the catchment. Excess supply of nutrients to water bodies contributes to gradual water eutrophication. This process can occur rapidly, particularly in shallow lakes, which are more susceptible to degradation. This also results in deterioration of habitat conditions for many organisms and limits the economic use of water. Eutrophication may lead to gradual shallowing and shrinkage of water bodies, and, consequently, to disappearance of lakes. Thus, proper diagnosis and reduction in the amount of pollutants flowing into lakes are key factors to improve water quality and prevent their further degradation. The aim of the study was to estimate the load of nitrogen and phosphorus to Lake Tomickie. In order to determine the rate of nutrient loading to the lake, nutrient retention and to recognise major sources of nutrients, modified method of Bajkiewicz-Grabowska was used. Nutrient balance was calculated based on data obtained in 2007. Water quality in the river was measured monthly. Results showed a significant contribution of the Samica Steszewska River to nutrient supply to the lake. Approximately 79% load of nitrate and 59% load of phosphate was delivered with river water, mostly during spring time. This was probably the consequence of agricultural land use of the catchment, as indicated by high nitrate concentrations in the water in March and April. It was very difficult to estimate pollution loads from non-point sources, particularly from farms specialised in pig production and household sewage treatment. Discharge of sewage to fish ponds located close to the lake was observed. Non-point sources provided about 11% of nitrate and 32% of phosphorus loads to the lake. The nutrient balance in Lake Tomickie was unfavourable. The obtained results indicate significant amounts of nutrients accumulated in the lake; it was estimated at the level of 3.7 tons nitrate and 0.12 tons of phosphate per year. Reduction of pollution sources is necessary to prevent further degradation of the lake.																			1506-218X						2010	12						861	878																WOS:000286695700050

Agricultural sources as major supplies of atmospheric phosphorus to Lake Kinneret	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Phosphorus (P) deposition through the atmosphere to fresh water bodies is a major supply pathway and, in some cases, can accelerate eutrophication processes. However, the quantification of atmospheric P fluxes to lakes is often not well established and the major P sources are generally poorly recognized. Here we present measurements of the atmospheric P deposition flux of two consecutive years in two sampling stations around Lake Kinneret, a large fresh water body in Northern Israel and quantified the dust daily P load emitted from 14 potential source sites upwind to the lake that include agricultural soils, pasture lands, livestock feeding zone sites and uncultivated lands. In addition, we analyzed phosphate oxygen isotopes (delta O-18(p)) in the deposited dust and in surface material from potential P sources around the lake such as cultivated and uncultivated soils, cow manure and compost. The mean daily dust P deposition to the lake ranged from 150 to 770 jig P m(2) day(-1), which accounts for ca. 5%-35% of the P concentrations in the lake water during summer. Dust deposition showed strong daily and monthly variations that were not associated with wind speed alone, indicating that local anthropogenic disturbances have a major control over the daily dust P flux. Simultaneous measurements of atmospheric P in different locations upwind to Lake Kinneret shows that the bulk of the P originated from sources in close proximity to the lake, with negligible P transported from distal sources. Quantification of the atmospheric P load emitted from potential sources upwind to the lake indicate that the highest daily loads of P are emitted from livestock feeding zone sites, probably because of a continuous accumulation of P in these soils. delta O-18(p) values (ranging from 19.1 parts per thousand to 24.8 parts per thousand) in deposited dust samples were significantly different than the values reported for natural soils, coal combustion and airborne tree pollen but in the in the same range as the values found for surface samples taken from agricultural lands fertilized with phosphate fertilizer, compost or cow manure or from uncultivated soils nearby, probably contaminated by agricultural P from nearby sites. Overall, our results show that deposition of dust originating from agricultural sources in close proximity to the lake supply substantial quantities of P to Lake Kinneret. Based on our results we suggest that when considering atmospheric P inputs to fresh water bodies more attention should be paid to land use in sites which are located upwind to the lake basin.

C	Vander Zanden, MJ; Rasmussen, JB		Philipp, DP; Ridgway, MS		Vander Zanden, MJ; Rasmussen, JB			Food web perspectives on studies of bass populations in north-temperate lakes	BLACK BASS: ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND MANAGEMENT	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM				Black Bass 2000 Symposium	AUG 21-24, 2000	ST LOUIS, MO	Amer Fisheries Soc, Bass Pro Shops, In Fisherman				There is growing recognition of the potential contributions of food web and ecosystem-level approaches to lake and fisheries management. Often, these approaches are data intensive and require information on predator-prey interactions and consumer diets. Gut content analysis adequately provides population-level diet information, but is more limited in ability to provide information at finer (intra-population) or coarser (whole food web) organizational scales. In this study, we review three applications of stable isotope techniques to studies of bass trophic ecology. In each case, the approach is used to provide quantitative information at organizational levels that is otherwise difficult to obtain using gut content analysis. In the first example, we examine intra-population trophic variation in young-of-the-year (YOY) smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. delta(13)C indicated ontogenic trophic habitat shifts from pelagic to benthic prey during first summer. delta(15)N was correlated with body size on the final sample date, suggesting that dietary differences might explain intra-population variation in growth rates. The second example demonstrates an application of stable isotope techniques to examine impacts of species invasion at the whole-food web scale. This approach revealed that lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, typically viewed as a pelagic predator, can often rely heavily on littoral prey fish.-Reduction in littoral prey fish following the invasion of nonnative smallmouth bass and rock bass Ambloplites rupestris prompted lake trout to shift towards planktivory. The third example uses stable isotope information to classify lakes according to their sensitivity to bass invasion. Stable isotope evidence indicated that bass and lake trout subsist on separate food chains in lakes that contain pelagic prey fish (cisco, lake whitefish, rainbow smelt). Thus, bass introductions into these lakes is predicted not to affect lake trout populations. Identifying particular lakes and lake-types that are sensitive to bass introductions can guide efforts of lake managers to minimize negative impacts of bass introductions on lake trout.

Todd; Arhonditsis, George			Long-term trends in water quality and C-Q relationships reveal complex interactions between changing land uses and climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in multi-decadal hydrological studies often rely on the assumption of stationarity, which in turn potentially hinders our ability to quantify pollutant export and to elucidate the relative impact of anthropogenic drivers and hydrological/biogeochemical mechanisms operating within a watershed context. In this study, we test this assumption using dynamic linear modelling to analyze the longterm trends in both C-Q slopes (strength of concentration-discharge relationship) and intercepts (flow-corrected mean water quality concentrations) for eight water quality constituents at twenty (20) sites in Southern Ontario, spanning a land use/cover gradient over the course of five decades. Notwithstanding the variability of the trends across constituents and sites, several interesting patterns of management interest emerged, including the distinctly increasing chloride (Cl-) concentrations with the strongest rates of change occurring in the 1970s and 1980s; decreasing total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations; and several sites showing increasing trends for calcium (Ca+2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. Our analysis also showed a recent reversal in mean riverine TP levels, with approximately half of the study sites displaying a weak-to-modest increase in the most recent decade. C-Q slopes were found to be largely stationary for alkalinity, Ca+2, and DIC; decreasing over time for nitrate (NO3-) and Cl-; and increasing for TSS and TP. Although not all slope trends suggest a shift in the nature of the C-Q relationships, we provide evidence of a shift in direction from diluting or chemostatic to enriching behaviour for TP in several watersheds. In contrast, despite the decreasing CQ slopes for NO3-, we found that the enriching pattern remains prevalent across many watersheds. One of the key lessons learned from our analysis is that the increasing uncertainty of the C-Q slopes and/or the recent non- monotonic export patterns of major water quality constituents predominantly reflect the increasing human pressure (agriculture, urbanization) and on-going changes in weather conditions (e.g., shifts in winter precipitation patterns) in many catchments across Southern Ontario.					; Mitchell, Carl/A-7212-2008; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009	Howell, Edward/0000-0001-6400-3495; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2025	652								132511	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132511		JAN 2025											WOS:001409314400001

Divergent Temporal Trends of Mercury in Arctic Char from Paired Lakes Influenced by Climate-Related Drivers	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Climate-driven changes including rising air temperatures, enhanced permafrost degradation, and altered precipitation patterns can have profound effects on contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), in High Arctic lakes. Two physically similar lakes, East Lake and West Lake at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada are being affected by climate change differently. Both lakes have experienced permafrost degradation in their catchments; however, West Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass Movement Events (MMEs; beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold increase in turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related effects on Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), an important sentinel species across the Circum-Arctic. Our objectives were to assess temporal trends in char Hg concentrations and to determine potential mechanisms driving the trends. There was a significant decrease in Hg concentrations in East Lake char, averaging 6.5%/year and 3.8%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. Conversely, in West Lake there was a significant increase, averaging 7.9%/year and 8.0%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, respectively, for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The best predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including possible dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake turbidity. Our study provides an example of how increasing lake turbidity, a likely consequence of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may influence fish condition and Hg concentrations.

Species Richness and Distributions of Boreal Waterbird Broods in Relation to Nesting and Brood-Rearing Habitats	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Identification of ecological factors that drive animal distributions allows us to understand why distributions vary temporally and spatially, and to develop models to predict future changes to populations-vital tools for effective wildlife management and conservation. For waterbird broods in the boreal forest, distributions are likely driven by factors affecting quality of nesting and brood-rearing habitats, and the influence of these factors may extend beyond singles species, affecting the entire waterbird community. We used occupancy models to assess factors influencing species richness of waterbird broods on 72 boreal lakes, along with brood distributions of 3 species of conservation concern: lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca), and horned grebe (Podiceps auritus). Factors examined included abundance of invertebrate foods (Amphipoda, Diptera, Gastropoda, Hemiptera, Odonata), physical lake attributes (lake area, emergent vegetation), water chemistry (nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a concentrations), and nesting habitats (water edge, non-forest cover). Of the 5 invertebrates, only amphipod density was related to richness and occupancy, consistently having a large and positive relationship. Despite this importance to waterbirds, amphipods were the most patchily distributed invertebrate, with 17% of the study lakes containing 70% of collected amphipods. Lake area was the only other covariate that strongly and positively influenced species richness and occupancy of scaup, scoters, and grebes. All 3 water chemistry covariates, which provided alternative measures of lake productivity, were positively related to species richness but had little effect on scaup, scoter, and grebe occupancy. Conversely, emergent vegetation was negatively related to richness, reflecting avoidance of overgrown lakes by broods. Finally, nesting habitats had no influence on richness and occupancy, indicating that, at a broad spatial scale, brood distributions are largely driven by the presence of quality brood-rearing lakes, not nesting habitats. Our findings are relevant to generating conservation plans or management goals; specifically, boreal lakes with abundant amphipods and surface areas >25ha are important habitat for waterbird broods and merit conservation, especially given the patchy distribution of amphipods. Moreover, these high quality brood-rearing lakes are much rarer, and thus more constraining, than are quality nesting habitats, which are likely abundant in the boreal.

Preliminary studies indicated that these viruses could be neutralised by antisera to perch rhabdovirus (Dorson et al. 1984) and may be similar to those previously isolated from grayling Thymallus thymallus and pike-perch Stizostedion stizostedion. The relationship between these viruses and the previously characterised fish rhabdoviruses, pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV), spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) and lake trout rhabdovirus, was investigated. Viruses were propagated in bluegill fry (BF-2) cells and were characterised using electron microscopy, serum neutralisation tests, immunofluorescence tests, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and nucleotide sequence analysis. The bullet-shaped viral particles appeared to be compact, with spikes visible at the surface, a morphology similar to that of the vesiculovirus group of rhabdoviruses. Serum neutralisation tests showed that the viruses were antigenically closely related to the previously characterised perch rhabdovirus, but were not significantly neutralised by antisera to PFRV, SVCV or viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV). In immunofluorescence tests with perch rhabdovirus antisera, strong specific fluorescence was observed in cell cultures infected with the new rhabdovirus isolates, but no fluorescence was observed with antisera to PFRV, SVCV or VHSV. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a polypeptide profile typical of vesiculoviruses, but the novel virus isolates had different relative mobilities of their P and M proteins compared to PFRV and SVCV. Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing of a 439 base-pair region of the viral L gene. The novel rhabdovirus isolates had < 76% nucleotide sequence identity to PFRV, SVCV and lake trout rhabdovirus and >95% identity to perch rhabdovirus. Phylogenetic analysis using both maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining methods assigned the perch rhaboviruses to a separate group to that of PFRV, SVCV and lake trout rhabdovirus. These data are the initial characterisation of a group of emerging fish vesiculo-type viruses that are biochemically and genetically distinct from the PFRV, SVCV and lake trout rhabdoviruses.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				DEC 29	2003	57	3					201	212		10.3354/dao057201	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao057201								14960032					WOS:000220379300003

These include mainstem reaches of some large river systems such as the Fraser and Skeena in British Columbia, as well as many smaller rivers from northern California to Alaska (including their associated tributaries), and even very small separate streams flowing directly into the sea, where headwater populations may inhabit isolated pools with oxygen levels dropping at times below 2 mg/L. In addition the species also may live for periods in nearshore marine waters, in estuaries, in sloughs and associated backwaters, as well as in standing waters ranging from very small bogs and ponds to large deep inland lakes. Nevertheless there are some surprising gaps in the coastal distribution of the species, such as that on northwestern parts of the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia. The spatial and temporal extent of this range is examined with specific examples drawn from the literature, as well as from unpublished studies, covering California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska. Though some populations are highly migratory between rivers or streams and estuarine regions, if not coastal seawaters, in others there are components that apparently never enter the estuary, let alone the sea, and still others that may spend their entire life isolated in one or at most a few headwater stream pools. Populations that dwell in small to large lakes (some well over 100 km inland from the coast) are surely migratory, but only between freshwater spawning habitat and freshwater feeding and/or wintering habitat. Small floodplain tributaries seem to be critical habitat for many sea-run populations. I suggest that the coastal cutthroat trout, one of a few early "pioneer" species reoccupying inland areas of the northwestern Pacific coast after glaciation, has responded to the associated pressures of environmental variability and unpredictability by partitioning its populations into a broad migratory/residency spectrum, "bet-hedging" its long-term continuity.																					0-913235-99-7				1997							20	26																WOS:000078223100005
J	RACINE, CH; WALTERS, JC				RACINE, CH; WALTERS, JC			GROUNDWATER-DISCHARGE FENS IN THE TANANA LOWLANDS, INTERIOR ALASKA USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Large expanses of herbaceous floating mat wetlands (FMW) bordered by slightly higher uplands with forest or scrub occur in the northwest corner of the Tanana Flats between the Alaska Range and the Tanana. River. Five major FMW systems, together with other outliers and extensions, are linear in shape and cover over 20 km(2). Nutrient-rich and circumneutral water flows slowly through these areas toward the northwest and through outlets to the Tanana River. The floating mat vegetation consists of tall emergent macrophytes; mosses, in particular Sphagnum spp., are conspicuously absent and shrubs are infrequent. Although species dominance shifts over short distances on the mat, four community types can be recognized: (1) Menyanthes trifoliata, (2) Carex aquatilis, (3) Typha latifolia, and (4) Calla palustris. Below the water surface, the mat extends to a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 m and consists of rhizomes and roots in a matrix of well-decomposed peat and water. The mat then either directly overlies unfrozen gray silts at a depth of 1 m, or more commonly, floats on a clear-water or loose peat zone above more consolidated peat lying on unfrozen silt at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 m. No permafrost or frozen ground was detected in late August or late winter below these floating mats but it is ubiquitous on the bordering uplands, 0.5 to 2 m above the FMW. The topographic location, apparent absence of permafrost, water chemistry, and vegetation composition suggest that these areas are fens fed by groundwater sources flowing out of the Alaska Range. Permafrost degradation and lateral expansion of these FMW is indicated by slumped blocks of forest pear, dead trees, and open water moats along the upland margin. Although floating mats are frequently described in the literature as occupying the edge of northern ponds and lakes, the FMW described here do not and they appear to be unique because of their large extent, absence of mosses, physiographic position, and presumed origin.																			0004-0851					NOV	1994	26	4					418	426		10.2307/1551804	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551804													WOS:A1994PT76900013

Water flowing through these caves is subsurface flow in the Apalachicola River drainage basin, and the caves are located just downstream from Jackson Blue (1st magnitude spring, >2.8 m(3) s(-1) discharge). Sedimentation in these caves is dominated by three primary sedimentary styles: (i) ferromanganese deposits dominate the basal recovered stratigraphy, which pass upsection into (ii) poorly sorted carbonate sediment, and finally into (iii) fine-grained organic matter (gyttja) deposits. Resolving the emplacement history of the lower stratigraphic units was hampered by a lack of suitable material for radiocarbon dating, but the upper organic-rich deposits have a punctuated depositional history beginning in the earliest Holocene. For example, gyttja primarily accumulated in HITW and Twin Caves from similar to 5500 to 3500 cal yr. BP, which coincides with regional evidence for water-table rise of the Upper Floridian Aquifer associated with relative sea-level rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and evidence for invigorated drainage through the Apalachicola River drainage basin, Gyttja sediments were also deposited in one of the caves during the Bolling/Allerod climate oscillation. Biologically, these results indicate that some Floridian aquatic cave (stygobitic) ecosystems presently receive minimal organic matter supply in comparison to prehistoric intervals. The pre-Holocene poorly sorted carbonate sediment contains abundant invertebrate fossils, and likely documents a period of enhanced limestone dissolution and cave formation (speleogenesis) during lower paleo water levels. Further work is still required to (a) determine whether precipitation of the ferromanganese deposits is inorganically or biologically mediated, (b) temporally constrain the emplacement history of the primary sedimentary styles, and (c) determine the full geographic extent of these sedimentary signals. However, these preliminary observations suggest that sedimentation in the inland underwater caves of northwestern Florida is related to Quaternary scale hydrographic variability in the Apalachicola River drainage basin in response to broader ocean and atmospheric forcing.

J	Eichler, TP				Eichler, Timothy Paul			The impacts of a warming climate on winter mid-latitude cyclones in the NARCCAP model suite	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) represents the next step in investigating the behavior of weather phenomena in current and future climate. Specifically, variations in mid-latitude cyclone tracks attributable to a warming climate have potential socio-economic consequences via the redistribution of precipitation on regional spatial scales. This manuscript assesses the impacts of a warming climate on cyclone tracks in the NARCCAP model suite. Specifically, cyclones are generated from eight 33-year simulations for the twentieth Century (1968-2000) and eight 33-year simulations for the A2 greenhouse scenario (2068-2100). To provide comparison, cyclone tracks are also generated from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and ERA Interim (ERA_INT) reanalysis datasets from 1979 to 2016. The results support that the NARCCAP model suite is capable of producing a reasonable cyclone frequency and intensity climatology when compared with the reanalysis datasets. Comparison of the ensemble twentieth Century cyclone (20C) tracks with the ensemble A2 cyclone tracks demonstrate a zonally-oriented poleward shift in cyclone track frequency in response to a warming climate. Intensity differences were regionally oriented, with cyclones being more intense in the A2 relative to the twentieth Century scenarios west of the Appalachians, suggesting cyclones acquire greater latent heat from warmer western Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico moisture sources in A2. A sector analysis revealed a higher total frequency of cyclones in both reanalysis datasets relative to either NARCCAP scenario. For intense cyclones, the NARCCAP model simulations produced more frequent cyclones in the Great Lakes and East Coast sectors. In contrast, reanalysis produced a higher frequency of weak cyclones for all sectors except Atlantic Canada. In addition, NARCCAP simulations were found to be capable of reproducing the broadness of intensity distributions in the reanalysis datasets, likely due to the fine spatial gridding in the NARCCAP models. Sector analysis for frequency and intensity affirmed the ensemble results, with individual model simulations showed a reduction in frequency for all sectors except the Canadian Maritimes for A2 relative to 20C. For intensity, cyclones were once again overall more intense for the upper Midwest/Great Lakes sector for A2 relative to 20C. The results of this research demonstrates the ability for regional climate models to be used to assess changes in synoptic-scale phenomena in a warming climate. Future work will focus on assessing cyclone structure including changes in moisture transport, precipitation, and the low-level jet.

Recreational leptospirosis is a major cause of infection; people contract leptospirosis via recreational activities in rivers or lakes. Okinawa Prefecture is located in the southernmost part of Japan, has a subtropical climate, and is a major tourist destination, with an estimated 10 million visitors annually. In this study, we revealed that the trend of leptospirosis in this prefecture has changed. Leptospirosis was considered an endemic disease among agricultural workers; however, during the last 17 years, most of the confirmed cases in Okinawa Prefecture were attributable to recreation or labor in rivers in the summer in the northern part of the main island of Okinawa and the Yaeyama region, which are designated as national parks with abundant nature. Since recreation in rivers is the most popular activity among tourists in Okinawa Prefecture, leptospirosis is a health concern not only for residents of Okinawa Prefecture but also for tourists. BackgroundLeptospirosis is considered an endemic disease among agricultural workers in Okinawa Prefecture, which is the southernmost part of Japan and has a subtropical climate, but data on the current status and trend of this disease are scarce. Methodology/principal findingsWe conducted a retrospective study of clinically suspected leptospirosis patients whose sample and information were sent to the Okinawa Prefectural Institute of Health and Environment from November 2003 to December 2020. Laboratory diagnosis was established using culture, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or microscopic agglutination test (MAT) with blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or urine samples. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the epidemiological information, clinical features, and sensitivities of diagnostic methods among laboratory-confirmed cases. Serogroups and the species of Leptospira isolates were determined by MAT using 13 antisera and flaB sequencing.A total of 531 clinically suspected patients were recruited, among whom 246 (46.3%) were laboratory confirmed to have leptospirosis. Among the confirmed cases, patients aged 20-29 years (22.4%) and male patients (85.7%) were the most common. The most common estimated sources of infection were recreation (44.5%) and labor (27.8%) in rivers. Approximately half of the isolates were of the L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis. The main clinical symptoms were fever (97.1%), myalgia (56.3%), and conjunctival hyperemia (52.2%). Headache occurred significantly more often in patients with Hebdomadis serogroup infections than those with other serogroup infections. The sensitivities of culture and PCR exceeded 65% during the first 6 days, while the sensitivity of MAT surpassed that of culture and PCR in the second week after onset. PCR using blood samples was a preferable method for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis. Conclusions/significanceThe results of this study will support clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of undifferentiated febrile patients in Okinawa Prefecture as well as patients returning from Okinawa Prefecture.

The technique involves processing satellite imagery and DEM's to map past rivers, catchments and evaluate the areas and volumes of palaeolakes. This information is used to determine the new Lake Evaluation Index (LEI) that allows a qualitative estimate of the amount of sediment received by lakes and how long-lived those lakes are. Lakes with considerable longevity and large sediment stores are selected for study. Validation is performed using image interpretation of remote sensing data, UltraGPR surveys and fieldwork. These techniques are also used to identify and study spring deposits and fluvial landforms that provide valuable palaeoclimate information. The method is applied to the Fezzan Basin in southern Libya focusing on the Wadi ash Shati and Wadi el-Agial catchments. Results indicate that the palaeohydrology is accurately mapped except within dune fields. We analysed the sedimentology of the key deposits identified by this methodology, developing a chronology using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating. We find evidence for relatively humid conditions during MIS 5c/d and e, as well as during the early to middle Holocene. Larger lakes and more extensive river systems were present during MIS 5 than are found during the Holocene, suggestive of greater humidity. The Holocene humid period started at similar to 11 ka and continued until similar to 5 ka being interrupted by abrupt periods of aridity at similar to 8.2 ka and similar to 6 ka that coincide with North Atlantic cooling. After each of these arid events the climate was less humid than previously, suggesting that they were superimposed upon an overall drying trend. The termination of the Holocene humid period in the Sahara has received much scrutiny in recent years, and sediments of Palaeolake Shati provide a continuous record of this. We do not find evidence to support the hypothesis of either sudden or gradual aridification of the Sahara at similar to 5 ka, instead we find that that aridity started to develop at similar to 6.5 ka, whereupon the lake levels oscillated until finally drying-up by 53 ka. Most of the other lakes in the Fezzan also dried up at similar to 5ka. We suggest that thousands of years of aridification prior to 5 ka shrunk these lakes so that additional aridity at this time led to their final desiccation. Because lakes are prodigious dust sources this mechanism potentially explains the rapid rise in dust flux to the Atlantic at 5 ka, with this final drying being the culmination of longer term aridity, albeit overprinted with considerable climate variability.

J	DEFELICE, TP; SAXENA, VK				DEFELICE, TP; SAXENA, VK			THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EXTREME EPISODES OF WET AND DRY DEPOSITION OF POLLUTANTS ON AN ABOVE CLOUD-BASE FOREST DURING ITS GROWING-SEASON	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												An analysis of a 3-yr database (1986-88) acquired near Mount Mitchell (35-degrees-44-'05"N, 82-degrees-17'15"W, 2038 m MSL) where the forest consists primarily of Fraser fir and some red spruce stands is presented. The site was immersed in clouds for 28%-41% of the time during each of the three growing seasons (15 May-15 September). This study only investigated extreme episodes of wet (cloud-water pH less-than-or-equal-to 3.1) and dry (e.g., an ozone concentration greater-than-or-equal-to 70 ppb) acidic deposition. Extreme wet events occasionally relieved periods of high ozone (greater-than-or-equal-to 70 ppb) exposures during the final field intensive. Extreme wet and dry events could activate the decline mechanisms in any above cloud-base forest, especially if the trees are exposed to such events during very early or very late stages of their lives. The exposure of the forest to natural climatic stress, such as drought conditions, wintertime temperatures during the growing season, snow storms during early spring, etc., would also subject the forest to a stressful period during which the exposure to the aforementioned episodes of pollutant deposition might trigger a decline. On the average, one of three cloud events that traverse this site is extreme. These extreme events usually last about 4 h, form during periods of high atmospheric pressure, have a liquid water content of 0.10 g m-3, and contain cloud droplets of mean diameter around 8.0-mu-m. During the dissipating stages, such cloud events result in maximum acidic deposition. When such events are preceded by very high ozone (greater-than-or-equal-to 100 ppb), they may prove even more detrimental to forest health. A precipitating cloud event (pH = 4.4 on the average) preceded by periods of very high ozone concentrations will become an extreme episode. Extreme acidic events can occur in association with 1) an 850-mb closed low, situated just north of Montreal, Canada, that advances southward into New York State, and 2) an 850-mb high extending over the Gulf of Mexico (between Florida and Louisiana) to over eastern Kansas. In contrast, an 850-mb low over the Indiana-Illinois-Kentucky border seems to be associated with nonextreme cloud events as it sets up a southwesterly-southeasterly flow into the site. Similarly, high pressure systems located north of the site (which travel from northern Ohio into Indiana and southward), and low pressure systems (which move between southern Quebec north of Lake Ontario and the New York State-Canadian border) are conducive to measurements of ozone exceeding 100 ppb at our site. Extreme cloud events may be characterized into four unique temporal pH patterns, each with a subpattern that includes rain. These patterns are found to be related to the physical characteristics of the sampled clouds, and to the synoptic and local meteorological conditions associated with them. A relationship between liquid water content and PH appears to exist for these events and seems to be dependent on the dynamics of their formation.																			0894-8763					NOV	1991	30	11					1548	1561		10.1175/1520-0450(1991)030<1548:TCOEEO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1991)030<1548:TCOEEO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991GP16000007
J	Li, YF; Guo, Y; Yu, G				Li, Yongfei; Guo, Ya; Yu, Ge			An analysis of extreme flood events during the past 400 years at Taihu Lake, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Considerable attention has been paid to the extreme floods affecting Taihu Lake and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (China) since they have caused serious socio-economic problems past and present. To fully understand these low probability events, it is necessary to build longtime-series of flood occurrence using flood-level proxies from archaeology and sedimentology that extends the period of observation beyond that of instrumental data. Using historical stele flood markers relicts and lacustrine sediment records from Taihu Lake, this paper attempts to reconstruct the historical flood events, to compare the stele-measured flood levels with those recorded by the modern gauges, and to identify the extreme flood signals among the flood events over the past 400 years. Results indicate that the lowest lake level of the 15 extreme floods by stele-records in the period 1600-1954 AD was 4.07 m a.s.l., equivalent to the 80th percentile of hydrological-gauged lake levels during 1921-2004 AD; this comparison provides a quantitative analogue for the floods reconstructed from lake sediments. Flood signals from coarse silt-sand sediments and low-frequency magnetic susceptibility profiles captured 85% of flood years in the historical period, and five extreme flood years that were missed in the stele flood records were found. There were three flood years that were identified from the historical documents in 1766, 1875 and 1882 AD, respectively, when lake-flood levels were estimated at 4.0-4.1 m, 4.1-4.2 m and 4.13-4.23 m, respectively. Spectral analysis was used to identify return periods from the three time series of the stele flood records, grain flood index and magnetic flood index, respectively; these analyses indicated some synchronous patterns and showed common return periods of 90-102 years, 60-62 years and 42-44 years. To test if the historical extreme floods have statistical relationships with climate variability, a two-variables-conditional test following Poisson's distribution was applied: the estimated probabilities of 0.17-0.20 between a proxy of the Pacific Decadal Osculation (PDO) and the flood events were obtained. These estimates indicate that the hypothesis that the two variables have significant correlations can be accepted, suggesting that the Taihu historical extreme floods were significantly linked with the changes in the Pacific monsoon and summer precipitation. This study demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing past extreme floods where gauge data are not available and has relevance to the prediction of future extreme floods which will have possible disastrous socio-economic impacts on the Taihu catchment.

J	EDWARDS, ME; BARKER, ED				EDWARDS, ME; BARKER, ED			CLIMATE AND VEGETATION IN NORTHEASTERN ALASKA 18,000 YR BP - PRESENT	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					8th International Palynological Conference	SEP 06-12, 1992	AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE					Changing abundances of taxa in the pollen record of northeastern Alaska contain a climate signal and may be compared with GCM simulations of paleoclimates. Cold, dry conditions indicated by full-glacial pollen spectra are in broad agreement with model simulations. Successive expansion of Betula and Salix, and later, Populus, during the deglacial period (14,000-11,000 yr B.P.) are likely correlated with the crossing of temperature thresholds determined largely by the size and position of the Laurentide ice. A degree of asynchroneity between sites probably reflects differential site responses to regional effects plus inaccuracies of radiocarbon dating. The early Holocene was probably the warmest period of the present interglacial, as summer climate was influenced by a strong positive insolation anomaly. Picea glauca expanded in major river valleys ca. 9000 yr ago and slightly later at upland sites in the Brooks and Alaska ranges. At some sites a Juniperus subzone, which suggests particularly warm and dry conditions, occurs between ca. 10,000 and 8000 yr B.P. Early mid-Holocene expansions of Alnus (8500-7000 yr B.P.) and Picea mariana (7500-5000 yr B.P.) suggest the subsequent development of moister conditions, which have continued to the present. Temporal patterns in Picea treeline position during the Holocene are different in northern Alaska, northwestern Canada and central Canada. In Alaska, the treeline is currently at its furthest Holocene extent. In northwestern Canada the treeline has retreated since the mid-Holocene, and in central Canada a mid-Holocene advance and retreat occurred. Such differences between regions suggest a complex response of this taxon to climatic controls and underscore the need to interpret vegetation changes in relation to regional-scale climate phenomena. If the pollen chronology is calibrated with reference to U-Th dates, the relationship of vegetational events to the insolation maximum at ca. 10,000 yr B.P. is significantly altered. The changed chronology also affects the interpretation of pollen records in relation to GCM simulations, which are partly keyed to calendar years.																			0031-0182					JUN	1994	109	2-4					127	135		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90172-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90172-4													WOS:A1994NZ35500002

Stable isotopes indicate that zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) increase dependence of lake food webs on littoral energy sources	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The influence of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on phytoplankton abundance is well known, but their community-level impact on energy flow is less clear. Reduced phytoplankton abundance could increase reliance of fish and aquatic invertebrates on alternative energy sources such as epiphyton and benthic algae. We assessed impacts of zebra mussels on energy flow by comparing food webs in two Minnesota, USA, lakes during summers of 2013 and 2014. Lake Carlos had a dense population of zebra mussels, while upstream Lake Ida was free of zebra mussels until this study began and maintained low densities during our study. We used baseline-corrected (BC) delta C-13 to test whether fish and littoral invertebrate primary and secondary consumers were more reliant on littoral carbon in Carlos compared to Ida. We also used BC delta N-15 to determine if trophic position of fish species differed between lakes. Lastly, we compared isotopic niche space by estimating standard ellipse areas for fish species in Carlos and Ida lakes, and tested whether the community-level range of trophic levels, reliance on littoral carbon and standard ellipse area differed between lakes. Results showed invertebrate secondary consumers had more enriched BC delta C-13 in Carlos than in Ida, indicating greater reliance on littoral energy. Mixing models indicated that 10 of 11 fish species were more reliant on littoral carbon in Carlos, with littoral carbon use in the 10 species 1.5-fold higher in Carlos. Isotopic niche analysis also showed increased littoral reliance in Carlos fish, as the same 10 fish species in Carlos had statistically distinct ellipses that were enriched in delta C-13. Mixing models also indicated that seven of 11 fish species analysed had significantly higher trophic positions in Lake Carlos. In contrast, community-scale metrics for fish showed no difference between lakes in the range of trophic levels, range of reliance on littoral energy, or size of standardised ellipse area of isotopic niche space. This indicates that, despite most individual fish species increasing their reliance on littoral energy and shifting upwards in trophic position, the overall size of the community isotopic niche area remained similar between lakes. Our results indicate that zebra mussels have community-wide impacts on energy flow in lakes, with invertebrate predators and many species of fish increasing their reliance on littoral energy sources, and most species of fish shifting to higher trophic positions. A key question is whether increased water clarity associated with zebra mussels can increase littoral production sufficiently to compensate for higher demand. If not, it is plausible that invertebrate and fish production will decline due to increased intra- and inter-specific competition.

This paper preliminarily reviews the progress made in salt lake research in China for the past 60 years. In the research of Paleoclimate and paleoenvironment from salt lake sediments, a series of salts have been proposed to be indicators of paleoclimate, and have been well accepted by scholars. The chloride-sulfate depositional regions of the west Qaidam and the east Tarim have been revealed to be the drought center of China since the Quaternary, and more than 6 spreading stages of arid climate (salt forming) have been identified. Five pan-lake periods with highstands have been proved to exist during the late Quaternary on the Tibetan Plateau. In mineral resource prospecting and theories of the forming of salt deposits: the atlas (1:2500000) of hydrochemical zoning of salt lakes on the Tibetan Plateau has been compiled for the first time, revealing the zonal distribution and transition from carbonate type to chloride type from south to north and presenting corresponding mineral assemblages for different type of salt lakes; several large continental salt deposits have been discovered and the theory of continental potash deposition has been developed, including the salt deposition in deep basins surrounded by high mountains, the mineral deposition from multistage evolution through chains of moderate or shallow lakes with multilevels, the origin of potassium rich brines in gravel layers, and the forming of potassium deposits through the inheriting from ancient salt deposits, thus establishing the framework of "Continental Potash Deposition Theory"; several new types of Mg-borate deposits have been discovered, including the ulexite and pinnoite bed in Da Qaidam Lake, Qinghai, the pinnoite and kurnakovite bed in Chagcam Caka, Tibet, the kurnakovite bed in Lake Nyer, and the corresponding model of borate deposition from the cooling and dissolution of boron rich brines was proposed based on principles of geology, physics and chemistry. The anti-floatation-cold crystallization method developed independently has improved the capacity of KCl production to 3 million tons per year for the Qarham, serving the famous brand of potash fertilizer products. One 1.2 million ton K-sulfate production line, the biggest in the world, has been built in Lop Nor, and K-sulfate of about 1.6 million tons was produced in 2015. Supported by the new technology, i.e. brine preparation in winter-cooling-solarization-isolation-lithium deposition from salt gradient solar pond" the highest lithium production base at Zabuye Lake (4421 m), Tibet, has been established, which is the first lithium production base in China that reaches the year production of 5000 tons of lithium carbonate. The concept of Salt lake agriculture (Salt land agriculture) has been established based on the mass growth of Dunaliella and other bacillus-algae and the occurrence of various halophytes in saltmarsh and salt saline-alkali lands, finding a new way to increase arable lands and develop related green industry in salt rich environments. Finally this paper presents some new thoughts for the further research and development on salt science, and the further progress in salt science and technology will facilitate the maturing of the interdisciplinary science "Salinology".

Hinterland drainage closure and lake formation in response to middle Eocene Farallon slab removal, Nevada, USA	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Hinterland basins can accumulate high resolution archives of orogenic processes and continental climate, but are challenging to reconstruct due to tectonic overprinting and the inherent complexity of their lithofacies assemblages. The Cordilleran hinterland of northeast Nevada has been interpreted to have overlain a flattened Farallon slab from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Slab removal and advection of asthenospheric mantle beneath Nevada have been invoked to explain a southwestward migrating wave of Eocene to Oligocene volcanism and proposed as a driver for topographic uplift. However, the timing of slab removal and possible subsequent delamination of North American lithospheric mantle can only ambiguously be related to the surface record. Subsequent Neogene extension and basin filling has complicated the correlation and interpretation of strata that record these events. Here we apply single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to 26 ash beds in northeast Nevada to reconstruct Paleogene geographic and hydrologic evolution. We use these ages and legacy geochronology to compare lithofacies and isotope proxy records of meteoric waters to regional tectonics and global climate, and assess competing tectonic interpretations for lake basin formation. Lakes formed locally prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in northeast Nevada, coeval with foreland lakes of the Green River Formation. The most expansive phase of lacustrine deposition resulted in onlap onto locally derived fluvial deposits and folded Paleozoic bedrock, and occurred between ca. 43.4 and ca. 40.8 Ma. Elko Formation strata exhibit a basin-wide transition from fluvial-lacustrine to fluctuating profundal lithofacies at ca. 42.7 Ma, suggesting a shift towards regional hydrologic closure. The stromatolitic upper Elko Formation is intercalated with ash fall tuffs and several partially welded to unwelded ignimbrites from increasingly proximal volcanism. Elko Formation deposition ended by ca. 40.4 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar ages for seven ash beds in the Dead Horse Formation at Copper Basin in northern Elko County indicate intermittent ash bed deposition between 45.2 Ma and 38.6 Ma, and an episode of lacustrine deposition between 39.8 Ma and 38.6 Ma that post-dates the main phase of Lake Elko. delta D values of volcanic glass sampled from dated ash beds reflect changes in the hydrogen isotope compositions of local Eocene waters, and systematically vary by 80-102 parts per thousand according to their depositional environment. The Elko Formation and overlying volcanic strata are overlain regionally by a pronounced unconformity of similar to 20 m.y. In the Copper Basin area, deposition continued locally into the Oligocene in the hanging wall of a ductile detachment. The geochronologic and isotopic framework presented here permits reanalysis of the Pinon Range carbonate proxy record that was previously interpreted to record both regional uplift and the middle Eocene climatic optimum. New data suggest instead that isotope values of hydration waters within the Elko Formation were strongly influenced by evaporation, and a change from lacustrine to non-lacustrine conditions can account for the delta O-18 shift that was interpreted to reflect regional uplift. Moreover, the end of Elko Formation deposition predated the middle Eocene climatic optimum. Hinterland basins can accumulate high resolution archives of orogenic processes and continental climate, but are challenging to reconstruct due to tectonic overprinting and the inherent complexity of their lithofacies assemblages. The Cordilleran hinterland of northeast Nevada has been interpreted to have overlain a flattened Farallon slab from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Slab removal and advection of asthenospheric mantle beneath Nevada have been invoked to explain a southwestward migrating wave of Eocene to Oligocene volcanism and proposed as a driver for topographic uplift. However, the timing of slab removal and possible subsequent delamination of North American lithospheric mantle can only ambiguously be related to the surface record. Subsequent Neogene extension and basin filling has complicated the correlation and interpretation of strata that record these events. Here we apply single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to 26 ash beds in northeast Nevada to reconstruct Paleogene geographic and hydrologic evolution. We use these ages and legacy geochronology to compare lithofacies and isotope proxy records of meteoric waters to regional tectonics and global climate, and assess competing tectonic interpretations for lake basin formation. Lakes formed locally prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in northeast Nevada, coeval with foreland lakes of the Green River Formation. The most expansive phase of lacustrine deposition resulted in onlap onto locally derived fluvial deposits and folded Paleozoic bedrock, and occurred between ca. 43.4 and ca. 40.8 Ma. Elko Formation strata exhibit a basin-wide transition from fluvial-lacustrine to fluctuating profundal lithofacies at ca. 42.7 Ma, suggesting a shift towards regional hydrologic closure. The stromatolitic upper Elko Formation is intercalated with ash fall tuffs and several partially welded to unwelded ignimbrites from increasingly proximal volcanism.

J	Fabrizio, MC; Adams, JV; Curtis, GL				Fabrizio, MC; Adams, JV; Curtis, GL			Assessing prey fish populations in Lake Michigan: comparison of simultaneous acoustic-midwater trawling with bottom trawling	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The Lake Michigan fish community has been monitored since the 1960s with bottom trawls, and since the late 1980s with acoustics and midwater trawls. These sampling tools are limited to different habitats: bottom trawls sample fish near bottom in areas with smooth substrates, and acoustic methods sample fish throughout the water column above all substrate types. We compared estimates of fish densities and species richness from daytime bottom trawling with those estimated from night-time acoustic and midwater trawling at a range of depths in northeastern Lake Michigan in summer 1995. We examined estimates of total fish density as well as densities of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus (Wilson), bloater Coregonus hoyi (Gill), and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax: (Mitchell) because these three species are the dominant forage of large piscivores in Lake Michigan. In shallow water (18 m), we detected more species but fewer fish (in fish/ha and kg/ha) with bottom trawls than with acoustic-midwater trawling. Large aggregations of rainbow smelt were detected by acoustic-midwater trawling at 18 m and contributed to the differences in total fish density estimates between gears at this depth. Numerical and biomass densities of bloaters from all depths were significantly higher when based on bottom trawl samples than on acoustic-midwater trawling, and this probably contributed to the observed significant difference between methods for total fish densities (kg/ha) at 55 m. Significantly fewer alewives per ha were estimated from bottom trawling than from acoustics-midwater trawling at 55 m, and in deeper waters, no alewives were taken by bottom trawling. The differences detected between gears resulted from alewife, bloater, and rainbow smelt vertical distributions, which varied with lake depth and time of day. Because Lake Michigan fishes are both demersal and pelagic, a single sampling method cannot be used to completely describe characteristics of the fish community. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Late Holocene hydrology inferred from lacustrine sediments of Laguna Chaltel (southeastern Argentina)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Hydrological changes that occurred during the last 4700 years have been reconstructed using multi-proxy analyses of sediment cores from the volcanic crater lake of Laguna Chattel (50 degrees S, 71 degrees W). The chronology is based on AMS C-14 age modeling constrained by paleomagnetic secular variations. Chemical and physical properties of the lake water together with results of lake-water surface-temperature monitoring, as well as sediment characteristics reveal conspicuous features archived as different sedimentary carbonate phases and morphologies which are attributed to lake-level changes. Sedimentological, geochemical and biological proxies together suggest the development from an initial playa lake-phase towards a system with progressively rising lake level. In detail, proxies indicate the existence of an ephemeral lake since 4700 cal BP until a glauberite-bearing carbonate crust formed around 4040 cal BP which probably is associated to the globally recognized 4.2 ka event. This crust is interpreted as a desiccation event terminating the ephemeral lake phase. Following this desiccation a shift towards conditions with a positive hydrological balance of Laguna Chattel occurs, which leads to the development of a saline lake with ooid formation between 4040 and 3200 cal BP. Further lake-level increase with initially high minerogenic input until 2700 cal BP resulted in a lake freshening which allowed the preservation of diatoms. Sigmoidal and star shaped carbonate crystals occurred until 1720 cal BP indicating a syn- or post-depositional formation of ikaite. Anoxic conditions and increased deposition of clay and sand through fluvial and eolian input are interpreted as a further lakelevel rise and/or a prolonged winter ice cover culminating during the Little Ice Age. The highest lake level was probably reached at that time and since then dropped to its present day height. Previous studies have shown that the southern hemisphere westerly winds (SWW) exert an oppositional control on hydrological regimes at the eastern and the western sides of the Patagonian Andes. At Laguna Chattel SWW forcing is changing evaporation rates by varying wind intensities, air temperatures and lake ice coverages as well as by precipitation rates (easterly vs. westerly sources of moisture). Our data suggests that the lake-level history of Laguna Chattel reflects changes in the SWW during the last 4.7 ka on the eastern side of the Andes. However, the elevated location of Laguna Chattel on an 800 m high plateau at the leeward side of the Andes potentially leads to a local overprint of the SWW influence on the hydrological balance.

Impact of the Prairie Evaporite dissolution collapse on McMurray stratigraphy and depositional patterns, Shell Albian Sands Lease 13, northeast Alberta	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Cretaceous McMurray Formation in NE Alberta contains nearly a trillion barrels of bitumen, a significant portion of which is being developed via surface mining and in-situ thermal methods. The focus of this report is the structure and stratigraphy of the Cretaceous McMurray Formation and its relationship to the configuration of the underlying Devonian section in the area of Shell Canada's Albian Sands Lease (Township 95, ranges 9 and R10W4M), a joint oil sands mining venture between Shell Canada (60%), Chevron Canada Limited (20%) and Marathon Oil Canada Corporation (20%). The structural and stratigraphic relationships between the two intervals has been the source of several recent investigations due to industry related incidents that demonstrated the integrity of the underlying Devonian succession can be compromised by vertical pathways associated with faults, sinkholes, or other features. Key findings of this work include the following: 1) The present morphology of the Pre-Cretaceous unconformity is primarily due to structural deformation (differential subsidence) related to dissolution and collapse of the underlying Prairie Evaporite Formation and overlying Devonian units of the Beaverhill Lake Group rather than erosion relief. 2) Two types of collapse structures are recognized: a) large scale sag folds that are 1-to-10 kilometres in extent; and b) small scale breccia pipes that are 10to- 100 metres in diameter. The sag folds are interpreted to have formed in response to the dissolution of halite. The breccia pipes, which postdate the sag folds, represent sinkhole features that formed in response to the dissolution of gypsum. 3) Rather than onlapping the unconformity, Lower McMurray strata thin and converge across structural highs and thicken and diverge across structural lows, demonstrating much of the dissolution driven subsidence was contemporaneous with the deposition. The subsidence produced up to 80 metres of accommodation and involved the coherent sagging and faulting of large intact segments of the underlying Devonian section. 4) The arrangement of major stratigraphic packages indicates subsidence features shifted locations through time rather than persisting through the entire Lower McMurray. 5) Changes in sedimentation style between sand-rich fluvial packages to mudrich lacustrine dominated packages within the lower McMurray reflect changes in relative rates of subsidence. Sand-rich fluvial units are localized in settings with low-to-moderate subsidence rates, while mud-rich fluviallacustrine units are localized in settings with moderate-to-high subsidence rates. 6) The Middle-to-Upper McMurray section is composed of four high relief unconformity bound units that display flat/horizontal stratal relationships with the underlying structure of the Pre Cretaceous unconformity. In contrast to the Lower McMurray, stratigraphic relationships indicate it was largely impacted by falls and rises in relative sea-level (cycles of negative and positive accommodation) rather than dissolution driven subsidence that, while still active, had begun to wane.																			0007-4802					MAR	2017	65	1					175	199		10.2113/gscpgbull.65.1.175	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gscpgbull.65.1.175													WOS:000424606100007
J	Staver, LW; Staver, KW; Stevenson, JC				Staver, LW; Staver, KW; Stevenson, JC			Nutrient inputs to the Choptank River estuary: Implications for watershed management	ESTUARIES												Degraded water quality due to water column availability of nitrogen and phosphorus to algal species has been identified as the primary cause of the decline of submersed aquatic vegetation in Chesapeake Bay and its subestuaries. Determining the relative impacts of various nutrient delivery pathways on estuarine water quality is critical for developing effective strategies for reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs to estuarine waters. This study investigated temporal and spatial patterns of nutrient inputs along an 80-km transect in the Choptank River, a coastal plain tributary and subestuary of Chesapeake Bay, from 1986 through 1991. The study period encompassed a wide range in freshwater discharge conditions that resulted in major changes in estuarine water quality. Watershed nitrogen loads to the Choptank River estuary are dominated by diffuse-source inputs, and are highly correlated to freshwater discharge volume. In years of below-average freshwater discharge, reduced nitrogen availability results in improved water quality throughout most of the Choptank River. Diffuse-source inputs are highly enriched in nitrogen relative to phosphorus, but point-source inputs of phosphorus from sewage treatment plants in the upper estuary reduce this imbalance, particularly during summer periods of low freshwater discharge. Diffuse-source nitrogen inputs result primarily from the discharge of groundwater contaminated by nitrate. Contamination is attributable to agricultural practises in the drainage basin where agricultural land use predominates. Groundwater discharge provides base flow to perennial streams in the upper regions of the watershed and seeps directly into tidal waters. Diffuse-source phosphorus inputs are highly episodic, occurring primarily via overland flow during storm events. Major reductions in diffuse-source nitrogen inputs under current land-use conditions will require modification of agricultural practices in the drainage basin to reduce entry rates of nitrate into shallow groundwater. Rates of subsurface nitrate delivery to tidal waters are generally lower from poorly-drained versus well-drained regions of the watershed, suggesting greater potential reductions of diffuse-source nitrogen loads per unit effort in the well-drained region of the watershed. Reductions in diffuse-source phosphorus loads will require long-term management of phosphorus levels in upper soil horizons.

However, estimating evaporation rates in complex terrains, such as the Omo Gibe III Reservoir area, poses significant challenges due to limited data availability and the influence of natural formations on local weather patterns. To solve this problem Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model employed. The WRF model employs the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Fifth generation of atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) climate dataset to simulate key meteorological parameters. The simulation period covers 2014 to 2020, with a one-month spin-up period (December 1-30, 2013) to ensure model stability. To evaluate the model performance, various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are employed. Reservoir evaporation is estimated by employing the mass transfer method and using WRF simulated meteorological variables. The findings highlight the WRF model-based estimatessuperiority over the MOD16 dataset, displaying lower MSE (85.22 versus 168.13) and higher NSE (0.91 versus 0.82), and signifying better agreement with observed evaporation patterns. Both models exhibit robust positive correlations with observed data (r: WRF - 0.97, MOD16-0.98), effectively capturing overall trends. The WRF model calculates a mean monthly average evaporation rate of 72.79 mm, which falls between Wolaita Station's estimate (76.70 mm) and is lower than MOD16 (86.61 mm). The standard deviation values indicate that MOD16 exhibits the highest variability (36.67 mm), whereas the WRF model-based estimates(26.58 mm) and estimates of observed Station at Wolaita (30.91 mm) show comparatively lower variability, suggesting more consistent estimates. The research emphasizes the importance of the WRF model in estimating evaporation rates at Gibe III Reservoir, assisting in water allocation, reservoir operation, and environmental preservation. Furthermore, its applicability in climate resilience and sustainable development.

J	Perrow, MR; Jowitt, AJD; Stansfield, JH; Phillips, GL				Perrow, MR; Jowitt, AJD; Stansfield, JH; Phillips, GL			The practical importance of the interactions between fish, zooplankton and macrophytes in shallow lake restoration	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER			Zooplankton, using macrophytes as refuges from predation by zooplanktivorous fish, are believed to be important in maintaining the macrophyte-dominated state in shallow lakes. Their grazing upon phytoplankton is also believed to be instrumental in preserving water transparency in the establishment phase of macrophytes which follows an attempt to restore a shallow lake from the effects of eutrophication. This paper interprets the results of fish, zooplankton and macrophyte interactions from an intensive 3-year study in the Norfolk Broads of eastern England. In the presence of even a low density of 0+ fish (0.2 m(-2)), Daphnia spp. which typically dominate the cladoceran community in spring, and through grazing are responsible for producing clear water, are typically reduced to very low levels. This decline may become protracted, but not eliminated, by the presence of macrophytes, implying a refuge effect. The efficacy of any refuge effect appears to increase with an increasing proportion of the water column occupied by macrophytes (PVI). As macrophytes develop, the grazing role is taken over by Ceriodaphnia spp. and Simocephalus spp., and may be at a sufficient rate to maintain clear water at least within macrophyte stands and possibly in intervening open water areas through diel migration of the zooplankton. A macrophyte PVI of 30-40% may provide an adequate refuge for these species through the mechanism of predation-free space, although this depends on fish density and community structure. At high densities (1 m(-2)) of a suite of fish species, including efficient foragers in open water (roach, Rutilus rutilus) and within macrophytes (perch, Perca fluviatilis), any refuge effect is nullified. In stable macrophyte-dominated lakes, the shift in fish community structure towards a higher proportion of piscivorous compared to zooplanktivorous fish may have a role in promoting the refuge effect through changing the distribution of zooplanktivorous fish. Predation upon zooplankton may also be reduced through the provision of alternative prey in the form of macrophyte-associated macroinvertebrates for an alternative fish stock dominated by perch, rudd ( Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and tench (Tinca tinca).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	1999	395						199	210		10.1023/A:1017005803941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017005803941													WOS:000082727900020
J	Wesstrom, ST; Creany, N; Monz, C; Miller, AB; D'Antonio, A				Wesstrom, Shannon T.; Creany, Noah; Monz, Christopher; Miller, Anna B.; D'Antonio, Ashley			The Effect of a Vehicle Diversion Traffic Management Strategy on Spatio-Temporal Park Use: A Study in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA	JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION												Parks and Protected Areas (PPAs) across the Intermountain West region of the United States have observed an increasing trend in visitation in the past decade. Management of visitors' vehicles as much as the visitors themselves has created a challenge for managers. Experiencing PPAs by personal vehicle is a popular recreation experience. However, as PPAs accommodate historic levels of visitation, the infrastructure to accommodate these vehicles is strained. In response to periods of especially high use in the summer months, Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO) actively limits access to the Bear Lake Corridor (BLC), one of the most popular day use areas of the Park. Because of limited parking infrastructure and capacities to provide a safe and quality visitor experience, ROMO redirects (i.e., diverts) vehicles away from the BLC. In July 2017, to examine the effect of this management intervention on visitor spatial behavior, participants intending to enter the BLC were given a Geographic Positioning System (GPS) device to track their movement throughout their visit to the Park. We performed a Distributive Flow analysis with the GPS data to understand the diversion's effect on traffic patterns of visitor vehicles diverted from the BLC. This study found that 21.2% of diverted visitor vehicles returned to the BLC after being redirected and 9% left the Park entirely, suggesting that there is a lack of substitutability for some visitors within the Park for the experience found along the BLC. During a period of redirection, Moraine Park, Endovalley, and Trail Ridge Road received increased levels of visitation as use was diffused across the Park, which may warrant increased monitoring of changes to the experiential and biophysical conditions in these locations. Diverted visitor vehicles made more stops, drove further distances and for a longer period of time than non-diverted visitor vehicles, but there was no significant difference in the length of time spent at points of interest within the Park. While the diversion was effective in temporarily reducing congestion in the BLC, its effect on visitors' spatial behavior suggests that overall aggregate impacts to park resources and experiential conditions may be increasing as a result.

Reconstruction of the mid-to Late-Holocene history of vegetation and land-use in Petresiunai, north-east Lithuania: Implications from palaeobotanical and archaeological data	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study presents the results of multi-proxy investigations of mid-to late-Holocene vegetation dynamics and land-use history associated with the Petresiunai archaeological site, north-east Lithuania. Identified vegetation changes are discussed in the context of both natural and anthropogenic factors determined within the site and its surroundings. The initial stages of colonisation and the subsequent land-use dynamics are discussed by applying the results of biostratigraphical and archaeological-historical data. To explore these issues, a lacustrine sediment core obtained from the stand-scale sedimentary basin was studied using a microbotanical (pollen and microcharcoal) survey and C-14 and magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements. Associations between proxies were statistically tested. In addition, archaeological excavations were conducted within the area of the Petresiunai hill fort. The results obtained show the presence of a heavily forested landscape with broad-leaved deciduous trees dominating the taxa existed in the area until approximately 4800-4700 cal BC. Low magnitude fire activity mainly caused by the natural factors was recorded. The expansion of spruce and the gradual decrease in thermophilous taxa suggests a local-scale climatic reversal started prior to the general decline of the HTM (Holocene Thermal Maximum). The decay of broad-leaved taxa followed by the pronounced culmination of Picea-dominated forest (2100-1500 cal BC) confirms the general re-organisation of the forest structure in the area. A small-scale vegetation stress, accompanied by an increase in fire interference suggestive of episodic Neolithic-Bronze Age human activity, was noted in the area at approximately 2800-2200 cal BC, 1800 cal BC and 1500 cal BC. Biostratigraphical and sedimentological data suggest agriculture practices and animal husbandry were introduced and the landscape was increasingly utilised between 1300 and 1000 cal BC, which preceded the archaeological record of the Petresiunai hill fort by a few hundred years. However, as indicated by pollen data, pastoral farming predominated the local economy until approximately 400 AD. The establishment of regular cultivation practices, including crop rotation, and the formation of permanent fields with introduction of winter cereals began in the surroundings of Petresiunai by the 6th - 7th c. AD. At that time, the secondary open Betula-dominant vegetation successions flourished in the area. A highly diversified landscape with large agriculture fields, open grounds, meadows and pastures culminated in the area between 1000 and 1300 AD. After this period, the intensity of the human-induced vegetation changes apparently decreased, which confirms re-organisation of the settlement pattern and land-use in this area.

Cenozoic paleogeographic evolution of the Elko Basin and surrounding region, northeast Nevada	GEOSPHERE												Geologic mapping, supported by 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb geochronology and geochemistry of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, reveals the details of the Cenozoic depositional and tectonic history of the eastern Pinon Range and central Huntington Valley in the north-central Basin and Range Province, Nevada (USA). Cretaceous to Miocene supracrustal successions were studied in detail in order to compare the geologic evolution of the upper crust near the Ruby Mountains-East Humboldt Range (RMEH) metamorphic core complex (MCC) with the magmatic, metamorphic, and deformational history of the deep crust in the developing MCC. During the well-documented Late Cretaceous-Oligocene history of partial melting and infrastructure development within the RMEH, surface deposits in Huntington Valley reflect general tectonic quiescence, with evidence for the development of the shallow Elko Basin, minor extension, and eruption of southward-younging ignimbrite flare-up volcanism. Thin, discontinuous successions of Cretaceous-early Cenozoic sedimentary strata were locally blanketed by rhyodacite ignimbrites, domes, and subvolcanic intrusions of the Robinson Mountain volcanic field between 38.5 and 36.8 Ma. This magmatic event represents the first local expression of Cenozoic volcanism linked to the ignimbrite flare-up, and its onset occurred slightly after a renewal of partial melting in the RMEH beginning ca. 42 Ma. The volcanic section was subsequently tilted >= 10 degrees-15 degrees west before ca. 33.9 +/- 0.4 Ma. Although melting continued at depth in the RMEH until after 30 Ma, there was no eruption of volcanic rocks after Robinson Mountain volcanism. An additional >= 10 degrees-15 degrees of westward tilting occurred between 31.1 +/- 0.3 Ma and ca. 24.4 Ma, as bracketed by the 31 Ma tuff of Hackwood Ranch (which was probably erupted from a distant caldera) and an angular unconformity beneath the overlying Miocene Humboldt Formation. Neither of these tilting events and unconformities appears to represent significant (>similar to 1 km each) extension, but they could be surface expressions of magmatism, metamorphism, and crustal flow at depth. The Humboldt Formation includes >2000 m of sediment deposited mostly between ca. 16 and 12 Ma, with deposition lasting until at least ca. 8.2 Ma. Humboldt Formation sediments thicken eastward, toward the west-dipping fault that bounds the RMEH, and are interpreted as a basin that developed in the hanging wall of this fault system. Motion on this normal fault system led to the exhumation of metamorphic and igneous rocks of the core complex similar to 10 m.y. after the documented cessation of partial melting, high-temperature metamorphism, and intrusion of granitoids into the deep crust ca. 29 Ma. Metamorphic clasts and a detrital zircon signature thought to represent RMEH provenance are first detected in 14.2 Ma or younger sediments.

J	BRANNEY, MJ				BRANNEY, MJ			ERUPTION AND DEPOSITIONAL FACIES OF THE WHORNEYSIDE TUFF FORMATION, ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT - AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE-MAGNITUDE PHREATOPLINIAN ERUPTION	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Whorneyside Tuff Formation is an extensive pyroclastic sheet within the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group of the English lake District. It marks a change in the eruptive style of a calc-alkaline continental arc volcano from multicentered eruptions of mostly basic and intermediate lavas to violent explosive activity associated with the development of a subaerial dacite-rhyolite caldera complex. The lower part of the formation consists of ignimbrite, deposited from hot pyroclastic flows that inundated the early-formed shield-like lava field. Thee pyroclastic flow deposits pass upward into a laterally extensive, shower-bedded phreatomagmatic tuff that is about 30 m thick. The change records access of large volumes of surface water to the erupting magma, and it was probably facilitated by volcanotectonic subsidence. The phreatomagmatic tuff is characterized by parallel bedding and lamination defined by variations in grain size and in abundance of crystal fragments. Abundant accretionary lapilli, block sags, and beds that drape irregular topography indicate its pyroclastic origin. The fine stratification records fallout from a vast umbrella cloud in rapidly successive localized showers of damp ash. The original grain size distribution and grain morphology of the phreatomagmatic tuff are not completely known, but the ubiquitous fine grain size even near the source, the sheet-like geometry, and the unusual thickness of the deposit all indicate an exceptionally large-magnitude phreatoplinian eruption. The phreatomagmatic tuff was deposited mainly on a subaerial ignimbrite plain and was subjected to minor gullying and redistribution by surface run-off water during the eruption. In proximal areas, however, the ash fell into shallow ephemeral lakes and was reworked by waves and redeposited in ash-rich turbidity currents and debris flows. While still wet, the near-vent deposits were intruded by degassed andesitic magma, forming peperitic sills. The subaerial phreatomagmatic tuff underwent widespread, intense soft-state sliding and slumping caused by seismicity and faulting during caldera subsidence, and it was preserved only because it was buried under intracaldera welded ignimbrites immediately after this deformation.

Here we use deformed lake shorelines in the Suguta and Turkana basins in northern Kenya as strain markers to estimate deformation rates at the 10(3)-10(4) yr time scale and compare them with rates spanning 10(1)-10(7) yr. Both basins are internally drained today, but until 7 to 5 kyr lake levels were 300 and 100 m higher, respectively, maintained by the elevation of overflow sills connecting them with the Nile drainage. Protracted high lake levels resulted in formation of a maximum highstand shoreline - a distinct geomorphic feature virtually continuous for several tens of kilometers. We surveyed the elevation of this geomorphic marker at 45 sites along >100 km of the rift, and use the overflow sills as vertical datum. Thin-shell elastic and thermomechanical models for this region predict up to similar to 10 m of rapid isostatic rebound associated with lake-level falls lasting until similar to 2 kyr ago. Holocene cumulative throw rates along four rift-normal profiles are 6.8-8.5 mm/yr, or 7.5-9.6 mm/yr if isostatic rebound is considered. Assuming fault dips of 55-65, inferred from seismic reflection profiles, we obtained extension rates of 3.2-6 mm/yr (including uncertainties in field measurements, fault dips, and ages), or 3.5-6.7 mm/yr considering rebound. Our estimates are consistent, within uncertainties, with extension rates of 4-5.1 mm/yr predicted by a modern plate-kinematic model and plate reconstructions since 3.2 Myr. The Holocene strain rate of 10(-15) s(-1) is similar to estimates on the similar to 10(6) yr scale, but over an order of magnitude higher than on the similar to 10(7) yr scale. This is coherent with continuous localization and narrowing of the plate boundary, implying that the lithospheric blocks limiting the Kenya Rift are relatively rigid. Increasing strain rate under steady extension rate suggests that, as the magnitude of extension and crustal thinning increases, the role of regional processes such as weakening by volcanism becomes dominant over far-field plate tectonics controlling the breakup process and the transition from continental rifting to oceanic spreading.

Vulture). Deep waters in these lakes are characterized by the presence of a significant reservoir of extra-atmospheric dissolved gases mainly consisting of CH4 and CO2. The delta C-13-CH4 and dD-CH4 values of dissolved gas samples from the maximum depths of the investigated lakes (from -66.8 to -55.6% V-PDB and from -279 to -195% V-SMOW, respectively) suggest that CH4 is mainly produced by microbial activity. The delta C-13-CO2 values of Lake Grande, Lake Piccolo, and Lake Albano (ranging from -5.8 to -0.4% V-PDB) indicate a significant CO2 contribution from sublacustrine vents originating from (1) mantle degassing and (2) thermometamorphic reactions involving limestone, i.e., the same CO2 source feeding the regional thermal and cold CO2-rich fluid emissions. In contrast, the relatively low delta C-13-CO2 values (from -13.4 to -8.2% V-PDB) of Lake Averno indicate a prevalent organic CO2. Chemical and isotopic compositions of dissolved CO2 and CH4 at different depths are mainly depending on (1) CO2 inputs from external sources (hydrothermal and/or anthropogenic); (2) CO2-CH4 isotopic exchange; and (3) methanogenic and methanotrophic activity. In the epilimnion, vertical water mixing, free oxygen availability, and photosynthesis cause the dramatic decrease of both CO2 and CH4 concentrations. In the hypolimnion, where the delta C-13-CO2 values progressively increase with depth and the delta C-13-CH4 values show an opposite trend, biogenic CO2 production from CH4 using different electron donor species, such as sulfate, tend to counteract the methanogenesis process whose efficiency achieves its climax at the water-bottom sediment interface. Theoretical values, calculated on the basis of delta C-13-CO2 values, and measured delta C-13(TDIC) values are not consistent, indicating that CO2 and the main carbon-bearing ion species (HCO3-) are not in isotopic equilibrium, likely due to the fast kinetics of biochemical processes involving both CO2 and CH4. This study demonstrates that the vertical patterns of the CO2/CH4 ratio and of delta C-13-CO2 and delta C-13-CH4 are to be regarded as promising tools to detect perturbations, related to different causes, such as changes in the CO2 input from sublacustrine springs, that may affect aerobic and anaerobic layers of meromictic volcanic lakes.

The role of coarse aerosol particles as a sink of HNO3 in wintertime pollution events in the Salt Lake Valley	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Wintertime ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) pollution events burden urban mountain basins around the globe. In the Salt Lake Valley of Utah in the United States, such pollution events are often driven by the formation of persistent cold-air pools (PCAPs) that trap emissions near the surface for several consecutive days. As a result, secondary pollutants including fine particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), largely in the form of NH4NO3, build up during these events and lead to severe haze. As part of an extensive measurement campaign to understand the chemical processes underlying PM2.5 formation, the 2017 Utah Winter Fine Particulate Study, water-soluble trace gases and PM2.5 constituents were continuously monitored using the ambient ion monitoring ion chromatograph (AIM-IC) system at the University of Utah campus. Gas-phase NH3, HNO3, HCl, and SO2 along with particulate NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NO3-, Cl-, and SO42- were measured from 21 January to 21 February 2017. During the two PCAP events captured, the fine particulate matter was dominated by secondary NH4NO3. The comparison of total nitrate (HNO3 + PM2.5 NO3-) and total NHx (NH3 + PM2.5 NH4+) showed NHx was in excess during both pollution events. However, chemical composition analysis of the snowpack during the first PCAP event revealed that the total concentration of deposited NO3- was nearly 3 times greater than that of deposited NH4+. Daily snow composition measurements showed a strong correlation between NO3- and Ca2+ in the snowpack. The presence of non-volatile salts (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), which are frequently associated with coarse-mode dust, was also detected in PM2.5 by the AIM-IC during the two PCAP events, accounting for roughly 5% of total mass loading. The presence of a significant particle mass and surface area in the coarse mode during the first PCAP event was indicated by size-resolved particle measurements from an aerodynamic particle sizer. Taken together, these observations imply that atmospheric measurements of the gas-phase and fine-mode particle nitrate may not represent the total burden of nitrate in the atmosphere, implying a potentially significant role for uptake by coarse-mode dust. Using the NO3-: NH4+ ratio observed in the snowpack to estimate the proportion of atmospheric nitrate present in the coarse mode, we estimate that the amount of secondary NH4NO3 could double in the absence of the coarse-mode sink. The underestimation of total nitrate indicates an incomplete account of the total oxidant production during PCAP events. The ability of coarse particles to permanently remove HNO3 and influence PM2.5 formation is discussed using information about particle composition and size distribution.					; Brown, Steven/I-1762-2013; Hallar, Anna/I-9104-2012; Middlebrook, Ann/E-4831-2011; Murphy, Jennifer/C-2367-2011; Hallar, Anna Gannet/I-9104-2012; Franchin, Alessandro/GVR-8219-2022	Petersen, Ross/0009-0005-6147-7499; Goldberger, Lexie/0000-0003-1507-6422; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X; Middlebrook, Ann/0000-0002-2984-6304; Murphy, Jennifer/0000-0001-8865-5463; Hallar, Anna Gannet/0000-0001-9972-0056; Hrdina, Amy/0000-0002-2126-8060													1680-7316	1680-7324				MAY 27	2021	21	10					8111	8126		10.5194/acp-21-8111-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8111-2021													WOS:000657177200001
J	Abbot, JIO; Homewood, K				Abbot, JIO; Homewood, K			A history of change:: causes of miombo woodland decline in a protected area in Malawi	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Tropical dry woodlands are thought to be declining as a result of human activity. Aerial photograph analysis showed measurable conversion of closed canopy miombo* to sparse woodland in Lake Malawi National Park, Malawi, from 1982 to 1990. This multi-disciplinary study investigates the possible contributions to these impacts by local use of domestic fuelwood, construction poles and fuelwood for commercial fish smoking. 2, Domestic fuelwood use was measured in 30 households over an 11-month period. Domestic fuelwood is collected by women and is headloaded to the village. It comprises a large biomass of mainly dead wood and small branches over a wide species range. Mean total annual domestic fuelwood consumption by the total enclave population was less than half the mean annual production of fallen dead wood in the Park, estimated from three quadrats harvested monthly over an 11-month period. 3. Construction poles are mostly small, have extended durability and come from a broad species range. Fencing poles frequently take root to form live hedges. Eucalyptus trees are commonly grown for poles. Construction pole use appears sustainable and shows signs of substitution. 4. The 305 commercial fish smoking stations in the enclaves used less fuelwood annually than domestic fuelwood users. However, the men who undertake this activity target large branches and logs from a narrow species range, involving destructive felling of canopy species. 95% of men collecting fuel for fish smoking use cutting tools and three-quarters transport the wood by boat or bicycle. 5. The scale, size classes and species involved in commercial fish smoking suggest that this activity drives the observed degradation of closed canopy to sparse woodland. Traditional local fishing focused on small species sun-dried for preservation. Commercial fish smoking was introduced relatively recently by immigrants, along with gill netting that harvests larger fish requiring smoking for preservation. Demand for fish by ever-increasing urban populations underpins the continuing growth of the fish smoking industry. 6. Disaggregation of different wood use practices allows informed management policy for the Park. Currently, management targets and penalizes domestic fuelwood collectors. While seeking to reduce demand and provide alternative fuelwood sources, law enforcement and forestry extension should be reorientated to address the extraction of fuelwood for fish smoking.

The cladocerans developed an unusually large population (maximum of ca. 2000 ind L-1) which caused drastic changes in the plankton communities found in the epi- and metalimnion. The food web structure in the epilimnion changed to a system that consisted almost exclusively of daphnids and heterotrophic bacteria. The extremely simple composition of the plankton was ideal for examining the controlling factors of the bacterioplankton and the interactions between Daphnia, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and bacteria. In situ grazing and growth rates of the organisms were determined by size-fractionation and incubation experiments. Further, the effect of nutrient additions (carbon and phosphorus) on the specific bacterial growth rate was assessed in the presence and absence of Daphnia. The predation impact of D. pulex on protozoans was much higher than on bacteria; feeding rates on nanoflagellates (2.9 mL ind-1 h-1) exceeded those on bacteria (0.4 mL ind-1 h-1) considerably. Despite the low bacterial clearance rate, the high biomass of daphnids was sufficient for keeping bacterioplankton below the carrying capacity. Bacterial growth (about one doubling per day) could be balanced by the grazing activity of D. pulex. Addition of organic carbon strongly enhanced bacterial growth rates whereas phosphorus addition had no effect. After the cladocerans were removed, heterotrophic nanoflagellates developed and became the main bacterivores. They achieved fairly high growth rates (doubling time of 4-8 hours) on the bacteria which were present. The temporary invasion of D. pulex in Lake Ciso created a situation where bacterial abundance was controlled by metazooplankton predation and specific growth rate was determined by the supply of organic carbon. Further, our results suggest that similar predation pressure can be exerted on bacteria by Daphnia and nanoflagellates. However, HNF and other protozoans become unimportant when large Daphnia populations are present.

The model comprises three algal groups, zooplankton, fish, detritus, zoobenthos, sediment detritus and some inorganic phosphorus fractions. All organic compartments are modelled in two elements, carbon and phosphorus. Within the model system, the phosphorus cycle is considered as completely closed. Carbon and phosphorus are described independently, so that the dynamics of the P/C ratios can be modelled. The model has been partly calibrated by a method based on Bayesian statistics combined with a Range Check procedure. Simulations were carried out for Lake Loosdrecht for the periods before and after the restoration measures in 1984, which reduced the external phosphorus loading to the lake from ca. 2 mgP m-2 d-1 to 1 Mgp m-2 d-1. The model outcome was largely comparable with the measured data. Total phosphorus has slowly decreased from an average 130-mu-gP l-1 to ca. 80-mu-gP l-1, but chlorophyll-a (ca. 150-mu-g l-1, summer-averaged) and seston concentrations (8-15 mg Cl-1) hardly changed since the restoration measures. About two-thirds of the seston consisted of detritus, while the phytoplankton remained dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria. The P/C ratio of the seston decreased from ca. 1.0% to 0.7 %, while the P/C ratios of zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish have remained constant and are much higher. The system showed a delayed response to the decreased phosphorus loading until a new equilibrium was reached in ca. five years. Major reasons for the observed resilience of the lake in responding to the load reduction are the high phosphorus assimilation efficiency of the cyanobacteria and the high internal recycling of phosphorus. A further reduction of nutrient loading, perhaps in combination with additional measures like biomanipulation, will be the most fruitful additional restoration measure.																			0018-8158					MAY 15	1992	233	1-3					119	136		10.1007/BF00016101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016101													WOS:A1992JD64800013

Very large contaminant inputs of Cd, Sb, Pb and Cr were evident in the sediment record. One potential large source for these metals was from a pigment manufacturing facility in Glens Falls, NY. The total range in stable lead isotope ratios observed in well-dated cores from about 15 miles downstream of the potential metal inputs was large (e.g., maximum difference in Pb-206/Pb-207 is 10%) and characterized by four major shifts occurring in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The temporal trend in Pb-206/Ph-207 has been used to establish precise dating of a sediment core from 24 miles further downstream. The large magnitude and abrupt shifts in stable lead isotope ratios preserved in upper Hudson sediment cores provide a way to significantly improve dating models, based only on radionuclide analyses. Cadmium, lead and antimony were identified as quite sensitive tracers of upper Hudson sediments due to the magnitude of contamination and the lack of significant additional downstream sources of these contaminant metals. Metal measurements in a pair of sediment cores located 24 miles apart were used to constrain relative fluxes of sediment entering the river between the two coring locations, with sediment sections deposited between the early 1960s and the late 1970s in these two cores suggesting that 3-4 times more sediment entered the river between the two coring sites than was transported from upstream. These dilution factors agree very well with estimates based on suspended sediment measurements during a flood event in April 1994 and with estimates based on mechanistic model of suspended sediment transport between 1977 and 1992, (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rough topography on the ice covering the lake surface traps sand that is transported by the wind. In late summer, vertical conduits form by melting and fracturing, making the ice permeable to both liquid water and gases. Cross-sections of the ice cover show that sand is able to penetrate into and apparently through it by descending through these conduits. This is the primary sedimentation mechanism in the lake. Sediment traps retrieved from the lake bottom indicate that rates of deposition can vary by large amounts over lateral scales as small as 1 m. This conclusion is supported by cores taken in a 3 x 3 grid with a spacing of 1.5 m. Despite the close spacing of the cores, the poor stratigraphic correlation that is observed indicates substantial lateral variability in sedimentation rate. Apparently, sand descends into the lake from discrete, highly localized sources in the ice that may in some cases deposit a large amount of sand into the lake in a very short time. In some locations on the lake bottom, distinctive sand mounds have been formed by this process. They are primary sedimentary structures and appear unique to the perennially ice-covered lacustrine environment. In some locations they are tens of centimeters high and gently rounded with stable slopes; in others they reach approximately 1 m in height and have a conical shape with slopes at angle of repose. A simple formation model suggests that these differences can be explained by local variations in water depth and sedimentation rate. Rapid colonization and stabilization of fresh sand surfaces by microbial mats composed of cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, and heterotrophic bacteria produces a complex intercalation of organic and sandy layers that are a distinctive form of modern stromatolites.																			0037-0746					APR	1991	38	2					363	379		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb01265.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb01265.x								11538650					WOS:A1991FM23700009

Transfer functions, based on regional calibration sets, are applied to reconstruct Holocene patterns in mean July air temperature (using all three indicators). mean January air temperature (pollen), annual precipitation (pollen) and lakewater pH (diatoms). During periods with 'good' fit to the modern calibration sets all mean July air-temperature inferences based on the three proxy indicators reveal a general trend of decreasing temperature: pollen-inferred mean July air temperature shows a decrease of c, 1.1degreesC since 7500 cal. yrs BP; the chironomids show a decrease of c. 1.2degreesC since the early Holocene whereas the diatoms show a decrease of c. 1.5degreesC since 6000 cal. yrs BP. Pollen-inferred mean January air temperature indicates that winters may have been warmer by c. 3.0degreesC during the early Holocene, followed by a gradual cooling until 8500 cal. yrs BP (c. 1.0degreesC warmer than today) and a subsequent warming until 7000 cal. yrs BP (c. 2.0degreesC warmer than today). Since 7000 cal, yrs BP, a gradual cooling towards the present-day values is inferred. According to the pollen, annual precipitation may have been considerably higher during the early Holocene than today (c. +150 mm) and increased until 7000 cal. yrs BP (c. +320 mm). Since 7000 cal. yrs BP, annual precipitation decreased continuously towards present-day values. Diatom-inferred pH trends show that natural acidification of c. 0.5 pH units followed deglaciation; present-day values were reached c. 5000 cal. yrs BP. The early Holocene is identified as a problematic time period for the application of modern calibration sets. as diatoms show 'poor' fit to the calibration set from 10 600 to 6000 cal. yrs BP. pollen from 10 600 to 7500 cal. yrs BP, and chironomids from 10 250 to 10 000 cal. yrs BP. Compared with estimates from the COHMAP GCM model, mean July air-temperature inferences based on biological proxies at Vuoskkujavri suggest a more moderate decrease in temperature over the past 9000 years.

ADAPTATION AND USE OF THEA"FRYBERGER METHOD" FOR SAND DRIFT POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT (ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE NADYM OB AREA)	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The desertification problem is very acute in currently. The intensification of aeolian processes in the north of Western Siberia was greatly influenced by human economic activity: sand mining, pipelines, road building, etc. At the same time, climatic factors (wind is the main one) and the material composition of sediments playAa paramount role in this matter. The wind regime and its directional variability have a great influence on the morphology and preservation of aeolian landforms. AAccurate data on sand transport rates are very difficult to obtain, so many different methods based on environmental assumptions have been proposed to match experimental data. Among them, the method developed by Fryberger is the most widely used. This method is a modification of an equation developed to describe the effect of wind energy on sand drift in a relative rather than absolute manner. This method is also a useful tool for assessing the direction and intensity of wind transport of sand and the extent of dune formation. It is widely used all over the world. In addition to arid regions, this method is used for sand blowing on the coasts of oceans and large lakes, in the Arctic and Antarctic, and even, in an adapted form, to the dune fields of Mars. Despite the widespread use of this method around the world in Russian geomorphology, it turned out to be practically unnoticed. In the proposed work we would like to provide a description of Fryberger method and an indication of the most obvious problems and errors that can affect the obtained result and lead to erroneous conclusions. The territory of the Nadym Priobye (north of Western Siberia) is considered as a model object for research. For this area, the sand drift potential index and its derivatives (RDD, RDP) were calculated. The calculation showed that the Nadym Ob area is a region with relatively low wind energy. Moreover, in warm seasons, wind energy is almost twice as powerful as in cold seasons. A predominant eastern direction of sand migration (RDD) has been identified, which is consistent with the orientation of aeolian forms on the dune massif. Almost all aeolian forms are concentrated in the southeastern part of the dune massif, where sand is moved by the northern and northwestern winds. The most active movement of the dune occurs in the summer. The directional variability (RDP/DP) was also calculated from the average wind speed, which showed a unimodal wind regimes in the region. The calculations of sand drift potential indicators made it possible to estimate the intensity of aeolian sand transport in the region. At the same time, some regional peculiarities in the application of the standard methodology were noted and possible options for correcting the errors obtained were proposed.																			2542-1379	2541-9943				MAR	2025		1								10.17223/25421379/34/8	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/25421379/34/8													WOS:001491774800008
J	Amarasinghe, KC				Amarasinghe, Kishan Chaleendra			Geoarchaeological research at Paleolithic open-air sites in the Levant: A review	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The stratigraphic record of Paleolithic open-air sites represents complex depositional histories involving local and regional-scale geological and geochemical formation processes in addition to anthropogenic activities. Therefore, accurate interpretation of the archaeological record of Paleolithic open-air sites rests on elucidating natural and human-induced processes that shaped their depositional sequence. In the Levant, open-air Paleolithic sites occur in all the biogeographic zones, but very few of them have been investigated for their site formation processes and the geoarchaeological context. The present study aimed to identify the constraints for geoarchaeological studies at open-air Paleolithic sites located in different geographic settings in the Levant. Methods and techniques applied in the previous geo-archaeological investigations were compared with their results to determine if those studies had met their aims. The majority of geoarchaeological research at open-air Paleolithic sites was conducted in Israel, while a few studies were done in Jordan. Research in Lebanon and Syria has been hindered by conflict. Analytical techniques used in case studies varied according to their objectives and the envi-ronmental setting where the sites were located. Sedimentological methods provided information about the environmental setting and the macro-level depositional processes at lake-margin sites. In contrast, micromorphology effectively identified the micro-level sedimentary facies which represented brief ep-isodes of deposition at floodplain, lake-margin, and spring settings. Mineralogical and geochemical methods FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) and XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) provided detailed information regarding the source of deposits, and fire episodes or oxidation in contexts where FeeMn stains were present. Employing multi-analytical methods including particle-size analysis, fabric anal-ysis, micromorphology, mineralogical methods, and GIS as opposed to relying on a single method would be a more effective approach to determining the source of sediments, medium of transportation, post -depositional alterations, and visualizing the evolution of a site. It is also important that future research focus on integrating information from cave sites and open-air sites with palaeoenvironmental data to determine human behavior at individual sites and human-environment interactions at the regional scale.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

SURFACE SEDIMENTS	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												During the summer of 1989 surface sediment samples were collected in Lake Coeur d'Alene, the Coeur d'Alene River and the St Joe River, Idaho, at a density of approximately one sample per square kilometre. Additional samples were collected from the banks of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene and the Coeur d'Alene Rivers in 1991. All the samples were collected to determine trace element concentrations, partitioning and distribution patterns, and to relate them to mining, mining related and discharge operations that have occurred in the Coeur d'Alene district since the 1880s, some of which are ongoing. Most of the surface sediments in Lake Coeur d'Alene north of Conkling Point and Carey Bay are substantially enriched in Ag, As, Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sb and Zn relative to unaffected sediments in the southern portion of the lake near the St Joe River. All the trace element enriched sediments are extremely fine grained (mean grain sizes much less than 63 mum). Most of the enriched trace elements, based on both the chemical analyses of separated heavy and light mineral fractions and a two step sequential extraction procedure, are associated with an operationally defined Fe oxide phase; much smaller percentages are associated either with operationally defined organics/sulphides or refractory phases. The presence, concentration and distribution of the Fe oxides and heavy minerals indicates that a substantial portion of the enriched trace elements are probably coming from the Coeur d'Alene River, which is serving as a point source. Within the lake, this relatively simple point source pattern is complicated by a combination of (1) the formation of trace element rich authigenic Fe oxides that appear to have reprecipitated from material solubilized from anoxic bed sediments and (2) physical remobilization by currents and wind driven waves. The processes that have caused the trace element enrichment in the surface sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.																			0885-6087					OCT-DEC	1993	7	4					403	423		10.1002/hyp.3360070406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360070406													WOS:A1993ME11400005

Hydraulic Reconstruction of the 1818 Gietro Glacial Lake Outburst Flood	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In the spring of 1818, ice avalanches from the Gietro Glacier created an ice dam, which in turn formed a glacial lake in the Drance Valley (Canton of Valais, Switzerland). Today, its maximum volume is estimated to have been 25x10(6) m(3). Cantonal authorities commissioned an engineer named Ignaz Venetz to mitigate the risk of the ice dam's failure. He supervised the construction of a tunnel through which a large volume of water was drained as the lake rose (9x10(6) m(3) according to his estimates and 11x10(6) m(3) according to our model). After 2.5 days of slow drainage, the ice dam failed on 16 June 1818 and caused major flooding in the Drance Valley up to 40 km downstream, resulting in about 40 deaths. Venetz's lake monitoring notes, numerous testimonies gathered in the disaster's aftermath, and our field survey have made it possible to collect a wealth of information on this event, which is one of the world's major documented glacial lake outburst floods. Reconstructing major outburst floods remains challenging because not only do they involve enormous volumes of water spreading over long distances but they are also associated with additional physical processes such as massive erosion; intense transport of ice, sediment, and debris; and damage to vegetation and buildings. This paper attempts to reconstruct the 1818 Gietro flood by focusing on its water component. We develop a simple model to estimate the initial hydrograph during the slow drainage and failure phases. The flood's features are deduced by solving the shallow-water equations numerically. The computational framework involves six free parameters, of which five are constrained by physical considerations. Using iterative manual parameter adjustments, we matched the numerical simulations to the historical data. We found that the peak discharge was close to 14,500 m(3)/s, the flood's front velocity was about 6 m/s, and flow depth varied considerably along the River Drance's bed (from 30 m just downstream of the ice dam to 2 m on the alluvial fan, 24 km west of the dam). To achieve a good agreement between computations and historical data, we had to select a high value for the Manning friction coefficient n (with n as large as 0.08 s/m(1/3)). As the Drance Valley is narrow, high flow resistance caused the flood's leading edge to behave like a plug, moving at a fairly constant velocity, with little dependence on what happened behind it. This result may explain why a simple flood routing model is able to reproduce the flood's features, because in an Alpine valley, a lateral spreading of the water volume is limited.					; Trewhela, Tomas/HKW-7804-2023; Huss, Matthias/JLL-6340-2023	Ancey, Christophe/0000-0003-3354-7398; Trewhela, Tomas/0000-0002-7461-8570; Bardou, Eric/0000-0001-9252-8774; Werder, Mauro/0000-0003-0137-9377													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2019	55	11					8840	8863		10.1029/2019WR025274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025274		NOV 2019											WOS:000495477500001
J	Micu, M; Micu, D; Havenith, HB				Micu, Mihai; Micu, Dana; Havenith, Hans-Balder			Earthquake-induced landslide hazard assessment in the Vrancea Seismic Region (Eastern Carpathians, Romania): Constraints and perspectives	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In seismically-active regions, earthquake-induced landslides (EqIL) are likely to enhance slope denudation and sediment delivery both over short and longer terms, which might strongly condition landscape evolution in general. In mountain regions marked by a medium to high seismicity, co-seismic slope failures typically present a relatively low frequency but also high magnitude pattern which should be addressed accordingly within land-slide hazard assessment, considering the already high frequency of precipitation-triggered landslide events. The Vrancea Seismic Region located in the curvature sector of the Eastern Carpathians (Romania) is the most active intermediate-depth seismic zones (focal depth > 70 km) in Europe. It represents the main seismic energy source throughout Romania with significant transboundary effects recorded as far as Ukraine and Bulgaria. During the last 300 years, the region featured 13 earthquakes with magnitudes (Mw) above 7, out of which seven events had Mw above 7.5 and three between 7.7 and 7.9. Apart from the direct damages, the Vrancea earthquakes are also responsible for causing numerous other geohazards, such as ground fracturing, groundwater level disturbances and deep-seated landslide occurrences (e.g. rock slumps, rock-block slides, rock falls, rock avalanches). The previous large earthquake-induced deep-seated landslides of the Vrancea region were found to affect the entire slope profile. They often formed landslide dams which strongly influenced the river morphology, posing a serious threat to human life and human facilities of the downstream rural communities through the imminent lake outburst floods. Despite the large potential of this research issue, the correlation between the region's seismo-tectonic context and landslide geomorphic predisposing factors has not been extensively documented and fully understood yet. Presently, the available geohazard inventories provide limited historical information to quantify the triggering role of seismic activity for observed slope failures across the Vrancea region. However, it is acknowledged that the morphology and geology of numerous large, deep-seated and dormant landslides of this region, which may be reactivated in future, with head scarps near mountain tops and located close to faults, in anti-dip slope conditions show significant similarities to the large mass movements with a proven seismic origin (such as in the Tien Shan, Pamir, Longmenshan, etc.). Thus, the relationship between landslide occurrences and the joint action of triggers and preparing factors (seismotectonic or climatic or both) needs to be investigated in more detail and further considered in the regional multi-hazard risk assessments. The purpose of this paper is to outline the current knowledge level of the landslide-earthquake relationship by accounting for the possible ef-fects of the previous major earthquakes in the Vrancea region. The key findings contribute to the gain of the baseline knowledge for an improved assessment framework of multi-hazard (earthquake-landslide) risks, as required by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR).

Controls on biochemical oxygen demand in the upper Klamath River, Oregon	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												A series of 30-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) experiments were conducted on water column samples from a reach of the upper Klamath River that experiences hypoxia and anoxia in summer. Samples were incubated with added nitrification inhibitor to measure carbonaceous BOD (CBOD), untreated to measure total BOD, which included demand from nitrogenous BOD (NBOD), and coarse-filtered to examine the effect of removing large particulate matter. All BOD data were fit well with a two-group model, so named because it considered contributions from both labile and refractory pools of carbon: BOD(t) = a(1) (1 - e(-a0t)) + a(2)t, Site-average labile first-order decay rates a(0) ranged from 0.15 to 0.22/day for CBOD and 0.11 to 0.29/day for BOD. Site-average values of refractory zero-order decay rates a(2) ranged from 0.13 to 0.25 mg/L/day for CBOD and 0.01 to 0.45 mg/L/day for BOD; the zero-order CBOD decay rate increased from early- to midsummer. Values of ultimate CBOD for the labile component a, ranged from 5.5 to 28.8 mg/L for CBCD, and 7.6 to 30.8 mg/L for BOD. Two upstream sites had higher CBOD compared to those downstream. Maximum measured total BOD(5) and BOD(30) during the study were 26.5 and 55.4 mg/L: minimums were 4.2 and 13.6 mg/L For most samples, the oxygen demand from the three components considered here were: labile CBOD> NBOD> refractory CBOD, though the relative importance of refractory CBCD to oxygen demand increased over time. Coarse-filtering reduced CBCD for samples with high particulate carbon and high biovolumes of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. There was a strong positive correlation between BOD, CBOD, and the labile component of CBOD to particulate C and N, with weaker positive correlation to field pH, field dissolved oxygen, and total N. The refractory component of CBOD was not correlated to particulate matter, instead showing weak but statistically significant correlation to dissolved organic carbon, UV absorbance at 254 nm, and total N. Particulate organic matter, especially the alga A. flos-aquae, is an important component of oxygen demand in this reach of the Klamath River, though refractory dissolved organic matter would continue to exert an oxygen demand over longer time periods and as water travels downstream.

Altaf			Evaluating Hysteresis Patterns in Sap Flow of a Red Pine Forest Subjected to Different Variable Retention Harvesting Treatments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Forests significantly influence regional and global water cycles through transpiration, which is affected by meteorological variables, soil water availability, and stand and site characteristics. Variable retention harvesting (VRH) is a forest management practice in which varying densities of trees, such as 55% and 33%, are retained after thinning or harvesting. These trees can be grouped together or evenly distributed. VRH aims to enhance forest growth, improve biodiversity, preserve ecosystem functions, and generate economic revenue from harvested timber. Application of VRH treatment in forest ecosystems can potentially impact the response of forest transpiration to environmental controls. This study analyzed the impacts of four different VRH treatments on sap flow velocity (SV) in an 83-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation forest in the Great Lakes region in Canada. These VRH treatments included 55% aggregated (55A), 55% dispersed (55D), 33% aggregated (33A), and 33% dispersed (33D) basal area retention, and an unharvested control (CN) plot, 1 ha each. Analysis of counterclockwise hysteresis loops between SV and meteorological variables showed larger hysteresis areas between SV and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (Tair), particularly in clear sky and warm temperatures in the summer. It demonstrated that PAR was the primary control on SV across VRH treatments, followed by VPD and Tair. Larger hysteresis loop areas and higher SV values were observed in the CN and 55D treatments, with lower values found in the 55A, 33D, and 33A plots. This suggests that maintaining dispersed retention of 55% basal area (55D) is the optimal forest management practice that can be utilized to enhance transpiration and forest growth. These findings will assist forest managers and other stakeholders to adopt sustainable forest management practices, thereby enhancing forest growth, water use efficiency, and resilience to climate change. Additionally, these practices will contribute to nature-based climate solutions.

Changes in algal species composition affect juvenile sockeye salmon production at Woss Lake, British Columbia: A lake fertilization and food web analysis	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In recent decades, the abundance of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Nimpkish River watershed (Vancouver Island) has declined by more than 80%. To improve sockeye salmon abundance, one of three Nimpkish nursery lakes (Woss Lake, 13.6 km(2)) was fertilized: a second (Vernon Lake, 8.4 km(2)) was maintained as an unmanipulated reference. For 3 years (2000-2002), we assessed changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton, and juvenile sockeye salmon and then used food web analysis to model the fate of fertilizer phosphorus (FP) as it moved up the food web to juvenile sockeye salmon. As the experiment progressed, we found two distinctly different results. During the first 2 years (2000 and 2001), fertilization was associated with higher concentrations of P, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton. However, because most of the algae were inedible diatoms (principally Rhizosolenia eriensis), only 8% of the algal standing stock was available to zooplankton and less than 0.1 % of the FP was incorporated into sockeye salmon biomass via limnetic pathways. The result was that juvenile sockeye salmon growth rates in the treated and control lakes were riot significantly different. During the third year (2002), a bloom of the diatom Leptocylindrus increased Woss Lake edible algal biomass by a factor of 7; zooplankton production tripled, and juvenile sockeye salmon production increased by 19%. Consequently, Woss Lake juvenile sockeye salmon grew twice as fast as they did in untreated Vernon Lake, and juvenile sockeye salmon fall weights were 50% higher than those recorded before the lake was fertilized. We conclude that for north Pacific coastal takes, bottom-up effects resulting from changes in phytoplankton species composition can profoundly alter rates of juvenile sockeye salmon production. Regulation of algal species composition through manipulations of fertilizer composition and application timing might be used to reduce blooms of nuisance algae and increase age-0 sockeye salmon yield.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2007	27	2					369	386		10.1577/M05-212.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-212.1													WOS:000246970200001

However, disturbed by the global financial crisis and reverse globalization since 2008, the past crude development path has been unsustainable. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to improve industrial resilience to avoid falling into a declining trap. This study integrates multi-source spatiotemporal information such as enterprise big data and panel data using the methods of GIS spatial analysis, complex network analysis, and multi-indicator comprehensive evaluation to evaluate the industrial economic resilience of Taihu Lake Basin (TLB). Resistance indicators such as resistance sensitivity, industrial land area, and regional economic connections are used to evaluate the resistance ability of the industrial economy in the TLB during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2018 Sino-US trade conflict. Resistance sensitivity and independent innovation ability are introduced to assess the recovery ability after two rounds of shocks, and comprehensive economic resilience is evaluated based on the entropy weighting method. The results show that in the face of the two economic shocks, the industrial economy in the TLB is increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks and has a significantly stronger ability to adapt to economic shocks. Under successive shocks, the industrial economy of the TLB continues to transition to a new path of innovation, which contributes to higher value-added and more efficient use of industrial land. Shanghai and Suzhou, which not only have shown strong economic resilience of their own but are also centers of independent innovation in the TLB, badly need to further reduce their reliance on low-end manufacturing in the future. Among the other cities, Huzhou and Zhenjiang show the highest level of resilience, while Changzhou, Wuxi, and Jiaxing are at the middle level, and Hangzhou is evaluated as the city with the lowest industrial economic resilience. Changzhou and Wuxi need to further increase the technical complexity of their industrial products, while Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Zhenjiang are supposed to strengthen their economic connections with Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou to expand the industrial scale further. Although Hangzhou shows the lowest comprehensive resilience, it still has a catalytic role to play in the development of industrial land and the upgrading and transformation of manufacturing in Jiaxing and Huzhou.

J	Rakovec, J; Skok, G; Zabkar, R; Zagar, N				Rakovec, Jaze; Skok, Gregor; Zabkar, Rahela; Zagar, Nedjeljka			The influence of the depth of a very shallow cool-pool lake on nocturnal cooling	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Cold air pools (CAPs) may develop during nights in very shallow depressions. The depth of the stagnant air within a CAP influences the process of the cooling of nocturnal air and the resulting minimum temperature. A seven-month long field experiment was performed during winter 2013/2014 in an orchard near Krsko, Slovenia, located inside a very shallow basin only a few metres deep and approximately 500 m wide. Two locations at different elevations inside the basin were selected for measurement. The results showed that the nights (in terms of cooling) can be classified into three main categories; nights with overcast skies and weak cooling, windy nights with clear sky and strong cooling but with no difference in temperatures between locations inside the basin, and calm nights with even stronger cooling and significant temperature differences between locations inside the basin. On calm nights with clear skies, the difference at two measuring sites inside the basin can be up to 5 degrees C but the presence of even weak winds can cause sufficient turbulent mixing to negate any difference in temperature. To better understand the cooling process on calm, clear nights, we developed a simple 1-D thermodynamic conceptual model focusing on a very shallow CAP. The model has 5-layers (including two air layers representing air inside the CAP), and an analytical solution was obtained for the equilibrium temperatures. Sensitivity analysis of the model was performed. As expected, a larger soil heat conductivity or higher temperature in the ground increases the morning minimum temperatures. An increase in temperature of the atmosphere also increases the simulated minimum temperatures, while the temperature difference between the higher and lower locations remains almost the same. An increase in atmosphere humidity also increases the modelled equilibrium temperatures, while an increase of the humidity of the air inside the CAP results in lower equilibrium temperatures. The humidity of the air within the CAP and that of the free atmosphere strongly influence the differences in equilibrium temperatures at higher and lower locations. The more humid the air, the stronger the cooling at the lower location compared to the higher location. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The signals of individual records have been attributed to different factors, such as air temperature ( T air ), atmospheric circulation patterns, hydrological changes, and lake evaporation. While every lake has its own local set of drivers of delta 18 O variability, here we explore the extent to which regional or even global signals emerge from a series of paleoenvironmental records. This study provides a comprehensive compilation and combined statistical evaluation of the existing lake sediment delta (18) O BSi records, largely missing in other summary publications (i.e. PAGES network). For this purpose, we have identified and compiled 71 down-core records published to date and complemented these datasets with additional lake basin parameters (e.g. lake water residence time and catchment size) to best characterize the signal properties. Records feature widely different temporal coverage and resolution, ranging from decadal-scale records covering the past 150 years to records with multi-millennial-scale resolution spanning glacial-interglacial cycles. The best coverage in number of records ( N = 37) and data points ( N = 2112) is available for Northern Hemispheric (NH) extratropical regions throughout the Holocene (roughly corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage 1; MIS 1). To address the different variabilities and temporal offsets, records were brought to a common temporal resolution by binning and subsequently filtered for hydrologically open lakes with lake water residence times < 100 years. For mid- to high-latitude ( > 45(degrees) N) lakes, we find common delta 18 O BSi patterns among the lake records during both the Holocene and Common Era (CE). These include maxima and minima corresponding to known climate episodes, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), Neoglacial Cooling, Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). These patterns are in line with long-term air temperature changes supported by previously published climate reconstructions from other archives, as well as Holocene summer insolation changes. In conclusion, oxygen isotope records from NH extratropical lake sediments feature a common climate signal at centennial (for CE) and millennial (for Holocene) timescales despite stemming from different lakes in different geographic locations and hence constitute a valuable proxy for past climate reconstructions.

J	Yuan, FS; Mayer, B				Yuan, Fasong; Mayer, Bernhard			Chemical and isotopic evaluation of sulfur sources and cycling in the Pecos River, New Mexico, USA	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The use of stable isotopes in studies of watershed biogeochemical processes has increased greatly throughout the last several decades. Much of the sulfur cycling research has addressed the influence of changes in atmospheric acid deposition on sulfur dynamics in temperate ecosystems. Little is known about sulfur cycling in dryland ecosystems such as those in the American Southwest. To identify the sources and assess the cycling of sulfur in dryland ecosystems, chemical and isotopic compositions of water were measured on samples collected from the Pecos River (New Mexico, USA) during a reconnaissance survey in spring 2010. Based on the chemical and isotopic results, the Pecos River is readily divided into an upper basin of 6,000 km(2) above Santa Rosa Lake and a lower basin of 44,000 km(2) above Red Bluff Reservoir in western Texas. The upper basin contains river water with low concentrations of chloride (3 mg/L) and sulfate (13 mg/L), low values of delta D (-87 parts per thousand) and delta O-18 (-12.3 parts per thousand), and low delta S-34 (-4.3 parts per thousand) and delta O-18 values (2.6 parts per thousand) of dissolved sulfate (delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4)). Three different sources contributing to the pool of dissolved sulfate are identified, namely the oxidation of sulfide minerals, the soil processing of atmospheric sulfate, and the dissolution of ancient evaporites. The relative contributions of the three different sulfate sources change from reach to reach. Sulfate from evaporite dissolution primarily of Permian age dominates in the lower reaches while sulfate from sulfide oxidation dominates in the upper part of the Pecos River. Despite significant lithologic variations across the lower basin, delta S-34(SO4) values of river water are quite constant, with an average value of 11.8%.. In contrast, a 5% decrease was observed in delta O-18(SO4) values of river water between upstream and downstream reaches of the lower Pecos River, indicating that 63% of the dissolved sulfate had been recycled. Surprisingly, most of the sulfur cycling observed occurs in two small irrigation districts (the Fort Sumner Irrigation District and the Carlsbad Irrigation District), whereas there is only a minimal decrease (0.7 parts per thousand) in delta O-18(SO4) in the largest irrigation district (the Pecos Valley Artesian Conservancy District). This study implies that the influence of land use activities on sulfur cycling may be more profound than previously thought.

Allen, Jr.			Evaluation of Capping Materials to Reduce Zinc Flux from Sediments in a Former Mining Pit Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Wilson Mine is a former vanadium mine site located in the Ouachita Mountains near Hot Springs, Arkansas. The site, which drains via two streams to Lake Catherine, has undergone extensive reclamation to significantly reduce groundwater and surface water contact with mine spoils. One of the streams passes through a former mine pit forming East Wilson Pond, and flux from pit lake sediments can result in elevated metal, that is, zinc (Zn), concentrations in overlying water. To mitigate potential risks, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of capping materials for partitioning Zn-contaminated sediments from overlying water in East Wilson Pond. A 28-day laboratory study compared the effectiveness of capping materials including combinations of limestone, bentonite clay, and gravel for mitigating Zn flux, including under reasonable worst-case conditions (pH 5.5) encountered in the hypolimnion. Dissolved Zn was monitored over time in overlying water and in sediment porewaters within untreated controls and within the capping layer of treated systems. The use of limestone and/or bentonite clay improved buffering capacity compared to the noncapped control, and pH declined gradually but only modestly in the overlying water and porewater of all treated systems. Concentrations of Zn in overlying water of the noncapped control increased from approximately 30 to 100 mu g/L during the study period, while concentrations in the overlying water and porewater of systems containing capping materials remained low (10-30 mu g/L). The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the capping materials for neutralizing pH and reducing Zn flux, and a three-layer cap consisting of limestone (top) + bentonite clay (middle) + gravel (bottom) was determined to be most effective. These results were used to inform the selection of materials for the application of a cap to reduce Zn flux from the pit lake sediments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-8.

J	Mao, MH; Xia, M				Mao, Miaohua; Xia, Meng			Particle Dynamics in the Nearshore of Lake Michigan Revealed by an Observation-Modeling System	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Given that few drifter experiments combined with a wave-current coupled model system had been conducted in the complex nearshore area, this work was motivated to reveal the nearshore dynamics by applying an observation-modeling system to Lake Michigan. Analysis of 11 surface drifters, wind, and current observations along the lake's eastern coast indicates that their trajectories are synergistically controlled by winds and initial releasing sites. Additionally, strong winds significantly impact nearshore dynamics, and the highly sensitive nearshore and offshore drifters are stranded in distinct regions. Simulations indicate that the model reproduces drifter trajectories and endpoints reasonably and that particle fates are mainly dominated by winds, while effects from heat flux and waves are also important. Further analysis of wave effects on particle dynamics indicates that both the wave-induced sea surface roughness and Stokes drift advection are crucial to the simulated particle trajectories during wind events. Finally, virtual experiments confirm that particle dynamics are evidently susceptible to winds and initial locations. Overall, both the inclusion of physics effects (e.g., adding winds, heat fluxes, and waves) and diminishing the model uncertainties (e.g., from various wind data sources, wind drag coefficient formulations, model grids, and vertical turbulent mixing parameterizations) are important methods to improve the particle simulations. The successful application of this nearshore observation-modeling system to Lake Michigan can be beneficial to the understanding of nearshore-offshore transports and larval and fisheries recruitment success in similar freshwater and estuarine environments. Plain Language Summary We combine surface drifter observations and computer simulations to understand movements of particles in the nearshore of Lake Michigan. Analysis of drifters' moving paths, wind, and current measurements in the summers of 2014 and 2015 indicates that drifter movements are strongly related to winds and initial releasing sites. Multiple computer programs were run to simulate the designed scenarios by artificially removing one of the influencing factors at each simulation from the model. We find that particle movements are collectively affected by winds, heat flux transfer between the air and lake water, and surface gravity waves. Further investigations demonstrate that both wave-induced sea surface roughness and Stokes drift advection are important to the simulated particle trajectories during wind events. After doing "what-if" scenarios in the computer model, distinct particle routes driven by wind-induced surface flows were simulated for virtual particles hypothetically released at various locations near the lake's southeastern coast. For example, nearshore group primarily shows longshore movements, while offshore one drifts into the deep basin. Overall, both the inclusion of physics effects (e.g., adding winds, heat fluxes, and waves) and diminishing the model uncertainties (e.g., from various wind data sources, wind drag coefficient formulations, model grids, and vertical turbulent mixing parameterizations) are important methods to improve the particle simulations. The outcome from this study will enhance the understanding of larval transport from nearshore to offshore areas in Lake Michigan and similar freshwater and estuarine environments.					; Mao, Miaohua/AAQ-7734-2020	Mao, Miaohua/0000-0002-3013-4849; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				AUG	2020	125	8							e2019JC015765	10.1029/2019JC015765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC015765													WOS:000577126400041

The samples were analyzed for TE using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the mean concentrations in P. segnis muscles were significantly lower in Ghar El-Melh (0.183 mg/kg DW, 1.887 mg/kg DW, and 0.986 mg/kg DW for Cd, Cu, and Al, respectively) compared to Bizerte Lagoon (0.227 mg/kg DW, 8.016 mg/kg DW, and 3.658 mg/kg DW for Cd, Cu, and Al respectively), except for Zn which exhibited similar concentrations in crabs harvested from both lagoons. The recorded concentrations of all TE measured in both lagoons were within acceptable limits per the recommended standards. The highest TE concentrations in P. segnis muscle tissue of crabs from both lagoons were recorded during the summer. The analysis of trace element (TE) levels in P. segnis and the assessment parameters, including estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), and target cancer risk (TCr), revealed values below the acceptable limits for human health. THQ and TCr are commonly utilized in environmental and health risk assessments to gauge the potential impact of contaminants on human health. As a result, we can affirm that the invasive crab P. segnis figures as a secure shellfish product suitable for human consumption in Tunisia. This study provides an opportunity to assess the health risks of consuming blue crabs, with the toxicity risk index aiding decision-making for consumers, policymakers, and stakeholders focused on safety and sustainability. Additionally, it offers fundamental insights to lay the groundwork for forthcoming studies on environmental assessments.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB 25	2025	197	3							327	10.1007/s10661-025-13766-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-13766-4								40000503					WOS:001432019400001
J	LOPEZ, JM; LEE, GF				LOPEZ, JM; LEE, GF			ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY OF COPPER IN TORCH LAKE, MICHIGAN	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A study of Keweenaw Peninsula [Michigan, USA] and adjacent Lake Superior waters was undertaken to evaluate the significance of Cu tailings deposit as a potential source of Cu and the controlling Cu concentrations in these waters. Metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption techniques. Cu concentrations, especially in areas affected by discharge of large quantities of Cu mine tailings for over 100 yr, were relatively high. Concentrations of apparently dissolved Cu of up to 100 .mu.g l-1 were found in Torch Lake in the summer of 1972. These high Cu levels may be partially explained by industrial spills of Cu wastes that occurred around that time. However, relatively high concentrations appeared to persist in Torch Lake waters throughout the annual cycle. The vast quantities of crushed Cu-bearing ore that comprise the bottom sediments and line the shores show a Cu content ranging from 1300-3800 mg l-1. These materials act as a reservoir of Cu providing a continual supply of Cu to these waters. Laboratory leaching studies of these materials demonstrate that they can release potentially significant amounts of Cu when suspended in lake water. Although the Cu levels found in Torch Lake exceed USA EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]-recommended maximum allowable levels for these waters, there are reports of substantial fish and algal populations. Equilibrium calculations indicate the predominance of various soluble Cu species in the following order of abundance: Cu(OH)+ > Cu2+ > CuCO3. However, Cu in these waters may not be controlled by solubility relationships of Cu compounds but rather by sorption onto surfaces of Fe and Mg hydrous oxides resulting in the occurrence of Cu in relatively non-toxic forms. Any additional mining or reclamation operations pose a potential hazard to aquatic ecosystems because of the wide-spread Cu contamination that already exists in the waters of this area.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1977	8	4					373	385																WOS:A1977DX95000001

As important indicator species, diatoms are widely used to explain past environment changes. The aims of this study were to describe the succession of the sediment diatom community in the large arid Bosten Lake and to discuss the responses of the diatoms to human activities and climate change over recent history. Sediment diatom analysis was applied to short core sediment samples extracted from the river mouth and the deep centre of Bosten Lake. The diatom assemblages were dominated by Cyclotella praetermissa, Fragilaria crotonensis and small fragilarioid and periphytic taxa. These diatom taxa are interpreted as being sensitive to changes in the water level and trophic status in the water column, which are probably related to the climate and human activities. The high percentage of Cyclotella praetermissa suggests that the water level was higher prior to the 1860s. From the 1860s to the 1950s, Aulacoseira alpigena appeared in the profundal zone, which indicates that spring winds may have been stronger. The high percentage of Navicula oblonga in the river mouth zone revealed that the lake might have been slightly brackish. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the percentage of planktonic diatoms decreased, and F. crotonensis appeared, which indicates that the water level was lower and that human activity had increased. From the 1980s to the end of the 20th century, the population, land cultivation, and fish production all increased, resulting in changes in salinity and a rapid decline in water levels. During this period, the diatoms at the river mouth of the Kaidu River were dominated by benthic species, and the deepest site of the lake was dominated by F. crotonensis. Since the 20th century, F. crotonensis has been dominant as the water level has increased and the trophic status has changed in the lake. Environmental changes in the Bosten Lake catchment affected the diatom assemblage in the profundal zone much earlier than in the river mouth zone. The patchiness of the diatom distribution within the lake macroenvironment indicates the influence of microenvironments on diatom community structure. Over the last several decades, human activities may have caused the ecosystem of Bosten Lake to exceed a threshold and collapse into a new state.

Yu			Convectively mixed layer in a boreal lake during the period of spring under-ice heating: Spatial structure and hydrodynamic parameters	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The paper presents the quantitative assessment of the hydrodynamic parameters of the convectively mixed layer (CML) arising in ice-covered boreal lakes as a result of nonhomogeneous heating of the water column. The study is focused on revealing the features of CML spatial structure and calculating all six elements of the turbulent stress matrix. The main feature of the experimental technique is application of two rigidly coupled acoustic current profilers (ADCP) installed on ice and operating in the asynchronous measurement mode. In the case of down-looking axes of both devices, their positions relative to each other were chosen so that one or two pairs of beams intersected at a certain depth. Due to this configuration, it was possible to perform a rigorous calculation of all turbulent stresses based on the data obtained from all six beams. The intensities of pulsations were estimated along all three axes, complete with error analysis. A high degree of anisotropy of the pulsations and a periodic nature of its change over time were detected. An analysis of the dynamics of average velocities carried out for depths of up to 2.87 m with discreteness of 2.5 cm (for CML thickness of 3-6 m) revealed the presence of quasi-deterministic convective cells. In the horizontal plane, a systematic "drift" was found, due to the presence of large-scale geostrophic circulation. The presence of such a drift made it possible, as a first approximation, to convert the experimentally obtained Eulerian characteristics into Lagrangian ones and, accordingly, draw conclusions about the spatial structure of the cells. In particular, based on the analysis of progressive vector diagrams in vertical planes, the depth ranges were determined at which the zones of up- or downwelling prevailed. The distribution of these zones is of great importance in studying the spatial dynamics of plankton.

The Fucino Basin, located in the Central Apennine chain of central Italy, contains a continuous and well-preserved lacustrine sedimentary record of T-V and MIS 11, dated using tephrochronology. In this paper, we report a high-resolution palynological analysis, supported by geochemical proxies, from the lowermost section of the F4-F5 composite record, to improve understanding of T-V in this region. This record reveals a substantial transition between MIS 12 and MIS 11c at 424.5 +/- 4.0 ka, from a very cold and dry environment indicated by the herbaceous and xerophytic association of Poaceae, Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Ephedra, and Hippoph & auml;e, and sedimentation dominated by inorganic siliciclastic sediments, to a warm and humid period characterised by a significant increase in Abies and a deciduous tree association mainly formed by Betula, Carpinus, Corylus, Quercus, Ulmus, and dominated by more organic calcareous sediments. This transition was correlated with a significant lake-level rise, with an enhanced nutrient input into the lake between 425.0 +/- 4.5 ka and 424.0 +/- 3.9 ka, as inferred from the variance between algae, aquatic plants, and terrestrial herbaceous taxa. Following the MIS 11c temperature maximum at 424.2 +/- 3.9 ka, a reduction in summer insolation occurred, provoking a significant increase in humidity that produced the widespread development of Abies. The results from this study suggest that, at Fucino, fluctuations in humidity are predominantly responsible for the vegetation changes observed during T-V.					; Tzedakis, Polychronis/J-1894-2012; Masi, Alessia/N-1302-2013; Sadori, Laura/E-4774-2015; Giaccio, Biagio/B-2561-2017; Di Vito, Mauro/MEQ-2109-2025; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012	Tzedakis, Polychronis/0000-0001-6072-1166; Vera Polo, Pablo/0000-0002-8646-1558; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2024	655								112486	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112486		SEP 2024											WOS:001311652800001
J	Simmons, SF; Harris, SP; Cassidy, J				Simmons, SF; Harris, SP; Cassidy, J			Lake-filled depressions resulting from cold gas discharge in the Ngawha Geothermal field, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Within the high temperature Ngawha geothermal field, there are four roughly circular, lake-filled depressions that are associated with cold gas discharge, thermal springs, peat deposits and lake sediments. Lake Waiparaheka is the largest (> 100 m in diameter) and Waitotara Pond is the smallest (similar to 50 m in diameter), and both are sites of vigorous gas bubbling. Two C-14 dates on woody material from surficial peats on the edge of Lake Waiparaheka give an approximate age of 5500 to 6 100 yr BP. Lake Waiparaheka and the other nearby lakes have been previously interpreted as sites of hydrothermal eruption because of their association with zones of surface thermal activity and the morphology of the depressions which they fill. Evidence of hydrotbermal eruption deposits (i.e., apron deposits of mixed clasts of various altered rock), however, is lacking. Detailed field mapping around Lake Waiparaheka reveals only peat deposits and elastic sediments consisting of clay, silt, fine-sand-sized grains of quartz. We propose an alternative explanation for the formation of tile Ngawha lakes, namely that disaggregation of the Ngatuturi Claystone, which occupies the shallow stratigraphy and underlies the peat deposits, have been elutriated and suspended into the water column by vigorous CO2 bubbling through sub-lacustrine vents, excavating funnel-shaped depressions. Such a process can be observed today in Lake Waiparaheka and Waitotara Pond, but it may have started when a large shallow lake filled the whole of the Ngawha basin. Subsequent drainage left isolated, remnant water-filled depressions that form the modem lakes. Exceptional aspects of the Ngawha geothermal field that contribute to such lake formation are the 500 m thickness of fine-grained sediments, which are relatively impermeable to deep geothermal liquid rising to the surface, but not to deep geothermal CO2, and the occurrence of claystone and siltstone in the shallow subsurface, which is easily disaggregated and elutriated in the vicinity of sub-lacustrine gas vents.

Because of the potential linkage between fish Hg and surface water acidification, factors regulating water column concentrations and bioavailability of Hg were investigated in Adirondack lakes through a field study and application of the Mercury Cycling Model (MCM). Concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg were highly variable, with concentrations of total MeHg about 10% of total Hg in lakes which did not show anoxic conditions. In lakes exhibiting anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion during summer stratification, concentrations of total MeHg were elevated. Concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg increased with decreasing pH in remote Adirondack lakes. However, more importantly, concentrations of total Hg and total MeHg increased with increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and percent near-shore wetlands in the drainage basin. Mercury concentrations in muscle tissue of yellow perch from Adirondack lakes were elevated above the U.S. FDA action level (1 mu g/g Hg) in 7% of the fish sampled or in one or more individual fish from 9 of the 16 lakes sampled. Fish Hg concentrations generally increased with increasing fish length, weight and age. Patterns of increasing Hg concentration with age likely reflect shifts in prey of yellow perch and the bioconcentration of Hg along the food chain. For age 3 to 5 perch, concentrations of Hg increased with increasing concentrations of DOC and percent near-shore wetlands in the drainage basin. However, for a lake with very high DOC concentrations, fish concentrations of Hg declined. Calculations with the MCM also show that concentrations of Hg species increase with increasing DOC due to complexation reactions. Increases in DOC result in increasing concentrations of Hg in biota but decreases in the bioconcentration factor of Hg in fish tissue. This research suggests that DOC is important in the transport of Hg to lake systems. High concentrations of DOC may complex MeHg, diminishing its bioavailability. At high concentrations of monomeric Al, the complexation of MeHg with DOC apparently decreases, enhancing the bioavailability of MeHg.

Possible influences of plasticity and genetic/maternal effects on species coexistence: native Gammarus fasciatus facing exotic amphipods	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Native species might be able to persist in the face of a detrimental exotic invader by occupying refuge habitats where the exotic is not successful. These refuges might then provide demographic subsidies that enhance persistence of the native species in areas of coexistence with the exotic species. Phenotypic plasticity of the native species could play a critical role in this process by allowing individuals dispersing from refuge to invaded habitats to adaptively modify their phenotypes, thereby enhancing the subsidy. By contrast, locally adapted genetic or maternal differences between native populations could result in fitness disadvantages for dispersers at invaded habitats, thereby reducing the subsidy. We studied phenotypic variation in a native amphipod (Gammarus fasciatus) across ion gradients in Lac St. Louis, Quebec, Canada. Ion gradients determine refuge vs. invaded habitats because native amphipods are found in both ion-poor and ion-rich habitats, whereas exotic (Echinogammarus ischnus) amphipods are found only in the latter. We tested for plastic vs. genetic/maternal contributions to spatial variation (ion-rich vs. ion-poor habitats) in native amphipod fitness components: postmoult calcification, body size, larval survival, time to first reproduction and fecundity. We did so by comparing the following: (i) F-0 (collected from the wild) individuals between the two habitats - some of which were reared for a time under varying conditions in the laboratory; and (ii) F-1 (reared in the laboratory for their entire lives) individuals from the two habitats under a variety of water conditions. We found strong plastic effects on postmoult calcification - it was more rapid in ion-rich water. We found genetic/maternal differences in time to reproduction (almost twice as long in ion-poor amphipods), fecundity and larval survival (higher in ion-poor amphipods) in early summer. These plastic effects and genetic/maternal differences are likely to be adaptive. Plasticity and genetic/maternal effects both could influence the efficacy of ion-poor populations in providing demographic subsidies that aid native persistence at ion-rich habitats where exotic amphipods are present. These effects could thus have important consequences for native species persistence in the presence of non-native species.

J	Bridgland, DR; Golledge, NR				Bridgland, David R.; Golledge, Nicholas R.			The Quaternary geology of the British Isles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												This editorial accompanies the second of two sets of papers in the Proceedings (the first set appeared in Part 4 of 2009) that arise from the Annual Discussion Meeting of the Quaternary Research Association, co-hosted by the Royal Geographical Society. This collection represents two main categories of paper: on (1) on sand and gravel, several arising from projects funded from the British Government's Aggregates Levy, and (2) glaciation, with a degree of overlap between these. Both categories also include results of PhD research. The first category includes presentation of fluvially-based data from SW England, North Yorkshire, the Trent and the Fen Basin, as well as studies of raised beach deposits in southern England and County Durham. At the boundary between the categories is a paper on a pre-glacial fluvial valley system in the glaciated Dyfi basin, west Wales, and another on the marginal area between the Late Devensian Welsh ice cap and the contemporaneous Irish Sea ice stream, encompassing glacio-fluvial sands and gravels as well as fully glacigenic diamictons. There are also papers on the Woore Moraine, in Shropshire, and the glaciofluvial deposits of the Brampton kame belt, east of Carlisle, Cumbria. Studies at either end of Yorkshire include a paper on the sedimentology and luminescence dating of Glacial Lake Humber deposits, in the central Vale of York, and another that documents deglaciation and the emergence of the rivers in the watershed area between the rivers of this Vale (the Swale-Ure-Ouse system) and the Tees, to the north. The latter is followed up by a third paper on the palaeo-environmental evidence from the middle 'piedmont' reaches of these rivers. Two final papers fall outside of these categories. One documents periglacial activity during the Loch Lomond Stadial in south London, revealing significant complexity. The second reviews the engagement of the Quaternary community with the formal education system, with institutions, policy makers, planners and with the public at large, offering examples of good practice and setting out aspirations for continuation of such 'outreach' in the future.

J	Amano, K; Watanabe, M; Kohata, K; Harada, S				Amano, K; Watanabe, M; Kohata, K; Harada, S			Conditions necessary for Chattonella antiqua red tide outbreaks	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Chattonella antiqua (Hada) Ono (Raphidophyceae) red tides have often been observed in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, since the 1960s, causing tremendous damage to fisheries. To estimate the conditions necessary for C. antiqua red tide outbreaks we developed an ecological model for diel vertical migration and nocturnal nutrient uptake. The model was expressed as vertically one-dimensional differential equations for PO43-, NO3-, NO4+, C. antiqua cell concentration, P cell quota, and N cell quota. To deal with diel vertical migration, the growth function was given by the Droop equation and nutrient uptake kinetics were given by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The model was calibrated with several sets of experimental data. Model calculations showed that the formation of a shallow nutricline (at similar to 6 m) was crucial for rapid growth of C. antiqua. Given that a shallow nutricline was formed, the calculation also suggested that;other environmental factors have to be within certain ranges for C. antiqua red tides to occur. If the retention time was <6 d or the grazing pressure was more intensive than that caused by 40 ind. liter(-1) of Paracalanus parvus, which feeds on C. antiqua, there was no chance for an outbreak in a bay of the Seto Inland Sea. Weak wind periods, which often occur in the Seto Inland Sea during summer, seem to enhance the chances of a C. antiqua red tide outbreak by strengthening water column stratification and making the water stagnant. If this occurs after a shallow nutricline has formed and active C. antiqua cells are present, which can be attributed to excystment at the bottom, then the conditions necessary for C. antiqua red tide outbreaks will be satisfied. Excystment occurs when temperatures rise (to similar to 20-22 degrees C), often due to intrusion of warm, saline Kuroshio Current water The conditions predicted by our model as necessary for C. antiqua red tides are consistent with this hypothesis. Our model quantitatively supports the hypothesis that C. antiqua can grow to the level of red tides by exploiting the unique environmental conditions found in the Seto Inland Sea.																			0024-3590					JAN	1998	43	1					117	128		10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0117	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0117													WOS:000073694200014

A rapid warming period reaching the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), followed by a general cooling trend until recent times, was observed in Eurasian lacustrine diatom oxygen isotope (delta O-18(diatom)) records. In this study, we present a new Holocene delta O-18(diatom) record from Lake Khamra (59.99 degrees N, 112.98 degrees E, Siberia). Our record aligns with Holocene delta O-18(diatom) records across the Northern Hemisphere, showing a general millennial-scale cooling trend following an initial maximum at 11.2 cal. ka BP and a second maximum at 6.7 cal. ka BP. These maxima correspond to the summer insolation maximum and elevated Northern Hemisphere air temperatures, as well as increased bioproductivity. Variability on centennial scales is likely driven by precipitation changes, which coincide with higher sedimentation rates and overlay the general decreasing trend throughout the Holocene. In addition, we compared two multiproxy datasets with decadal resolution from Lake Khamra, including delta O-18(diatom) data and biogeochemical proxies such as total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes, and total mercury (THg). The datasets cover a similar to 210-year period (c. 6.140-6.350 cal. ka BP) at the end of the HTM and a recently published similar to 220-year record (c. 1790-2015 CE) that embraces the anthropogenic times. The comparison of these two warm phases reveals distinct differences in both the absolute values and the variability of the records. Regarding the d18Odiatom data, the recent period shows a nearly threefold increase in range and double the standard deviation, suggesting greater hydroclimatic variability compared to the end of the HTM. Notably, THg levels indicate a sharp increase in recent decades, while delta C-13 declined, contrasting with the observations at the end of the HTM. We attribute these observations partially to far-reaching anthropogenic effects on remote lake systems.

J	Cox, PA				Cox, Paul Alan			BMAA, Neurodegeneration, and Neuroprotection	NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH												In this volume, studies springing from a BMAA symposium held in Salt Lake City, Utah, in April 2019 are presented. Although most studies of neurotoxicity consider the effects of BMAA as an isolated molecule, it is now known that environmental exposures can be to a combination of BMAA-related molecules, including enantiomers, isomers, other co-occurring cyanotoxins, and BMAA carbamates. Within the body, BMAA may exist in equilibrium with alpha- and beta-carbamates formed in the presence of bicarbonate. BMAA and its isomers 2,4-DAB and AEG, accumulate over decades in biocrusts and persist at depths in soil profiles of the Gulf deserts. In Florida, releases of cyanobacterially ladened water from Lake Okeechobee can extend into coastal environments where diatoms and possibly dinoflagellates also produce BMAA and isomers in addition to brevetoxins. Along the African Lake Chad, neurotoxic risks from consumption of dried cyanobacterial cakes may, however, be outweighed by their amino acid addition to otherwise protein-deficient diets. Discrepancies in the detection and quantification of BMAA from different laboratories likely originate in the use of different analytical methods. C-18 columns, used to study derivatized BMAA, can efficiently separate BMAA from its isomers in validated methods, while validation is not possible for HILIC columns in the study of underivatized BMAA, since they do not adequately separate BMAA from its isomer BAMA. The presence of BMAA dimers, metal adducts, and carbamates may result in underestimation of BMAA by mass spectrometry. BMAA research led to the identification of the dietary amino acid L-serine as a neuroprotective molecule. In animal and clinical trials, L-serine appears to slow neurodegeneration, although the modes of action are still under study. Based on zebra fish sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, investigators have found that L-serine reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) but does not protect auditory hybridoma cells from cisplatin. Another possible mode of action of L-serine, induction of autophagic-lysosomal enzymes, is also being explored. The hypothesis that cyanobacterial exposures in general, and chronic exposures to BMAA in particular, may prove to be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses has not been without critics. Emerging from the symposium, a multi-authored response to one such critical paper appears in this collection of articles. Instead of waiting until there is a conclusive proof of risk, the adoption of the "precautionary default principle," proposed by Ingvar Brandt and his colleagues in Sweden, is suggested. Avoidance of exposures to cyanobacterial blooms and other sources of BMAA is suggested, until further research indicates such precautions to be unnecessary.

X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) can provide a fast, non-destructive and high-resolution method for elemental analysis in these studies. However, the semi-quantitative results of XRF element scanning are difficult to compare with other regional environmental proxies in different regions. Here, we investigated the geochemical and other environmental proxies of Fuxian Lake sediments using the elemental log-ratio calibration equation (LRCE) and wavelet analysis, reconstructing a comprehensive historical account of soil erosion and human activity in the lake catchment area over the past 5000 years. The results revealed that elemental log-ratios, such as ln(Rb/Sr), ln(Ti/Sr), ln(Zr/Sr), and ln(Fe/Mn), reliably indicate soil erosion in the Fuxian Lake catchment. Moreover, the results of wavelet transform coherence analysis (WTC) indicate that there is a 1000-year periodic signal in the geochemical records of lake sediments since 5000 cal. a BP. This suggests that soil erosion processes in the lake catchment on a millennial scale were predominantly controlled by climatic changes in the mid-Holocene, and a distinct 20 similar to 50-year periodic signal emerged after 2200 cal. a BP., indicating enhanced erosion within the lake catchment. It has been confirmed by the records of intensified human activity and the rapid expansion of agricultural cultivation after 2200 cal. a BP., and supported by regional archaeological data. Meanwhile, human activities have had a lasting impact on the sedimentary characteristics and land-use patterns of the lake catchment over the past similar to 2000 years. This research will enhance our understanding of how land-use and soil erosion within lake catchments respond to human activities, thus affecting long-term environmental transformations in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau margin.

J	Croci, A; Della Porta, G; Capezzuoli, E				Croci, Andrea; Della Porta, Giovanna; Capezzuoli, Enrico			Depositional architecture of a mixed travertine-terrigenous system in a fault-controlled continental extensional basin (Messinian, Southern Tuscany, Central Italy)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The extensional Neogene Albegna Basin (Southern Tuscany, Italy) includes several thermogene travertine units dating from the Miocene to Holocene time. During the late Miocene (Messinian), a continental fault-controlled basin (of nearly 500-km(2) width) was filled by precipitated travertine and detrital terrigenous strata, characterized by a wedge-shaped geometry that thinned northward, with a maximum thickness of nearly 70 m. This mixed travertine-terrigenous succession was investigated in terms of lithofacies types, depositional environment and architecture and the variety of precipitated travertine fabrics. Deposited as beds with thickness ranging from centimetres to a few decimetres, carbonates include nine travertine fades types: F1) clotted peloidal micrite and microsparite boundstone, F2) raft rudstone/floatstone, F3) sub rounded radial coated grain grainstone, F4) coated gas bubble boundstone, F5) crystalline dendrite cementstone, F6) laminated boundstone, F7) coated reed boundstone and rudstone, F8) peloidal skeletal grainstone and F9) calci-mudstone and microsparstone. Beds of terrigenous deposits with thickness varying from a decimetre to >10 m include five lithofacies: F10) breccia, F11) conglomerate, F12) massive sandstone, F13) laminated sandstone and F14) claystone. The succession recorded the following three phases of evolution of the depositional setting: 1) At the base, a northward-thinning thermogene travertine terraced slope (Phase I, travertine slope lithofacies association, F1-F6) developed close to the extensional fault system, placed southward with respect to the travertine deposition. 2) In Phase II, the accumulation of travertines was interrupted by the deposition of colluvial fan deposits with a thickness of several metres (colluvial fan lithofacies association, F10 and F12), which consisted of massive breccias, adjacent to the alluvial plain lithofacies association (F11-F14) including massive claystone and sandstone and channelized conglomerates. Travertine lenses, of 2-3-m thickness, appeared intermittently alternating with the colluvial fan breccias. 3) In the third phase, the filled fault-controlled basin evolved into an alluvial plain with ponds rich in coated reed travertines, which record the influence of freshwater (travertine flat lithofacies association, F7-F9). This study shows the stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary evolution of a continental succession, wherein the hydrothermal activity and consequent travertine precipitation were driven by the extensional tectonic regime, with faults acting as fluid paths for the thermal water. Fault activity created the accommodation space for travertine and colluvial fan accumulation. Erosion of the uplifted footwall blocks provided the source of sediments for the colluvial fan breccias, which alternated with the thermogene travertine precipitation. Climatic oscillations might have led to the recharge of the aquifer that fed the hydrothermal vents. The studied continental succession in an extensional basin provides valuable information about the interplay between thermogene travertine and alluvial/colluvial deposition, which in turn might improve the understanding of similar fault-controlled continental depositional systems in outcrops and the subsurface.

J	Bjornerud, MG				Bjornerud, M. G.			Evidence for Grenville-Age Seismicity and Thick-Skinned Deformation in Northern Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												One of the great continental rifts in all of Earth's history, the ca. 1.1-Ga Midcontinent Rift of the Lake Superior region, was closed and inverted less than 100 m.yr. after its initiation, when rift-bounding normal faults were reactivated as reverse faults. This was a major crustal event involving "thick-skinned" deformation, but its tectonic importance has not been fully appreciated, owing in part to the lack of good outcrop along the traces of the rift-closing faults. A rare exposure of one of these faults occurs near the falls of the Marengo River in southeastern Bayfield County, Wisconsin. The Atkins Lake-Marenisco fault is a crustal-scale structure that juxtaposes Archean granitic gneisses with Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. Pseudotachylytes, cataclasites, and microbreccias in the fault zone record large (M similar to 7) seismic events at midcrustal levels, followed by a protracted period of frictional wear and intermittent fluidization of fine-grained material along the fault. Pervasive vein networks indicate that the zone acted as a conduit for fluids throughout its history. Slip on the Atkins Lake-Marenisco zone and other rift-closing faults occurred at the same time as the widely known but poorly understood hydrothermal copper mineralization in northern Michigan and Wisconsin. Recent hydrologic simulations of the relationships among deformation, permeability, and fluid flow in midcrustal fault zones suggest that reverse slip on reactivated rift-bounding faults may have triggered both upward and downward fluid flow, and this may help to explain the complex geochemical and isotopic signatures of hydrothermal mineral assemblages along the margins of the Midcontinent Rift. The regional structure and outcrop-scale features of the Atkins Lake-Marenisco fault zone require that significant horizontal stresses, presumably from the coeval Grenville orogen, were transmitted far into the interior of the continent, more than 500 km west of the conventional placement of the Grenville Front.

Long-term and continuous lacustrine records of anthropogenic fire are a more effective means of addressing this problem than the fragmentary terrestrial records available for the lower Yangtze region. We constructed a Holocene fire history revealed by records of black carbon content (BCC) and grain size of the sediments of Lake Nanyi in the lower Yangtze. Our results show the following: 1) Peaks in fire activity occurred during-8400-6500 (fire peak P1) and -1100-0 cal BP (fire peak P2), while weaker fire activity occurred during-6500-1100 cal BP (S2). 2) This temporal pattern of fire activity, with a double peak (P1-S2-P2), was asynchronous from east to west across the lower Yangtze. The warm and humid climate would not have caused intense fires and the reduction of forest during-8400-6500 and -1100-0 cal BP. Therefore, we suggest that anthropogenic ignitions, corresponding to pronounced population fluctuations after 8400 cal BP, dominated the regional fire activity. Combined with archaeological evidence, the inverse relationship between the agricultural and population levels and fire intensity during the mid-Holocene suggests that fire intensity at this time was the result of the diversity of landscape types associated with pre-historic subsistence patterns, rather than the magnitude of anthropogenic activity. Combined with sea level, rainfall and archaeological evidence, we propose a mechanism whereby asynchronous water-level rise during-8400-6500 cal BP forced the migration of humans to the foothills where they often used fire to modify the landscape as part of a broad-spectrum subsistence pattern. Whereas, water-level fall after 6500 cal BP expanded the area of open ground for human settlement, and in this less diverse landscape, less use was made of fire in agricultural subsistence. Overall, our study reveals how regional water-level, driven by sea-level rise and extreme rainfall, delayed the transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture in the lower Yangtze region.					; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; Shen, Zhongwei/KDO-9452-2024; Yan, Xinwei/LHA-3221-2024; Zhang, Zhiping/MVY-0861-2025; Dong, Haoran/GTO-4345-2022	Chen, Zhitong/0000-0002-9142-281X; Yan, Xinwei/0000-0003-3413-6048; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 1	2024	633								111902	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111902		NOV 2023											WOS:001112705300001
J	Frank, MG; Conover, MR				Frank, Maureen G.; Conover, Michael R.			Spatial and temporal distribution of phalaropes (Phalaropus spp.) and adult brine flies (Ephydra spp.) are linked on Great Salt Lake, Utah	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, is home to some of the world's largest concentrations of Wilson's Phalaropes (Phalaropus tricolor), Red-necked Phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus), American Avocets (Recurvirostra ameri-cana), and Black-necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus). These birds spend several weeks on GSL feeding on larvae, pupae, and adult brine flies (Ephydra spp.) before migrating to their wintering grounds in Central and South America. Unfortunately, GSL is shrinking in size and becoming more saline due to water diversions and climate change. Assessing how a smaller and more saline GSL will affect adult brine flies is difficult without knowing their temporal and spatial dis-tribution on GSL. During 2014 and 2015, we measured adult brine fly abundance across different GSL bays during July through September, when phalaropes are staging on the lake. Abundance of adult brine flies showed a bimodal pattern, peaking during weeks 27-29 and then again during week 33. Wilson's Phalaropes were abundant during the first peak in fly numbers but not during the second peak; Red-necked Phalaropes exhibited the opposite pattern. Time of day and weather had little impact on adult fly numbers, with the exception that abundance was positively correlated with air tem-perature. During this study, a deep brine layer (which is toxic to brine fly larva) existed at water depths >6 m, and adult brine fly abundance was low over these areas. Adult brine fly abundance did not differ with distance from shore or time of day but was positively correlated with salinity. Substrate impacted their abundance, with adult brine flies being 5 times more abundant over microbialites-which are rocky, reef-like structures-than over sand or mud. Phalarope numbers were also highest over microbialites. Thus, most brine fly eggs are laid over microbialites, which is the preferred habitat for brine fly larvae and pupae. Information about the temporal and spatial distribution of adult brine flies is critical for wildlife managers who are tasked with ensuring that GSL will continue to support the large avian populations that depend on GSL's adult brine flies for their existence.

J	Kallemeyn, GW; Rubin, AE; Wasson, JT				Kallemeyn, GW; Rubin, AE; Wasson, JT			The compositional classification of chondrites .7. The R chondrite group	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Bulk compositional and petrographic data clearly define the new R (Rumuruti) group of chondrites consisting of Rumuruti (the only fall), ALH85151, Acfer 217, Carlisle Lakes, Dar al Gani 013, PCA91002, PCA91241, Y-75302, Y-793575, and Y-82002. Compositional, petrographic, rare-gas, and O-isotopic data strongly suggest that PCA91002 and PCA91241 are paired. The Yamato specimens are probably not paired. The matrices of the known R chondrites have experienced similar, minor degrees of metamorphism; petrographic types are 3.8-3.9 with the exception of ALH85151, 3.6. All except Carlisle Lakes contain equilibrated (R5-R6) clasts. Petrographically, the R chondrites are characterized by a low chondrule/matrix modal abundance ratio, high states of oxidation (reflected by abundant NiO-bearing olivine with Fa37-40), relatively small chondrules (mean apparent diameters of similar to 400 mu m), abundant (up to similar to 11 wt%) sulfides (mainly pyrrhotite and pentlandite), and negligible amounts of metallic Fe-Ni. Refractory lithophile abundances are similar to 0.95 x CI, intermediate between those in ordinary chondrites (OC) and CI chondrites. Abundances of the volatile elements Se and Zn are greatly enhanced relative to OC. The R chondrites are clearly distinguished from other chondrite groups on the basis of Al/Mn and Zn/Mn abundance ratios. The oxygen isotopic data plot roughly along a slope-1/2 line, with whole-rock Delta(17)O values higher than for any other chondrite group. Rumuruti, Acfer 217, ALH85151, PCA91002, and PCA91241 have light/dark dark structures and solar-wind-implanted rare gases indicating that they are regolith breccias. The Yamato specimens also have light/dark structures and are inferred to be regolith breccias. Carlisle Lakes lacks solar rare gases and is unbrecciated. Based on similarities in refractory lithophile abundances (less than or equal to 0.95 x CI), oxygen isotope compositions (Delta(17)O greater than or equal to 0), and refractory inclusion abundances (<0.1 vol%; none have been reported), the R chondrites probably belong to a noncarbonaceous superclan of chondrites that also includes ordinary and enstatite chondrites. The high oxidation state, high matrix/chondrule modal abundance ratio, relatively low abundance of droplet chondrules, and high Delta(17)O composition suggest that the R chondrites formed at greater heliocentric distances than the OC.

Plankton dynamics due to rainfall, eutrophication, dilution, grazing and assimilation in an urbanized coastal lagoon	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												After a prolonged summer dry period, the effects of a distinctive and continuing rainfall on the nutrients and plankton of an urban coastal lagoon were investigated over 2 months. The lagoon filled up over 5 weeks from <10% of its maximum volume until it broke open to the sea. Nutrients (ammonia and oxidised nitrogen) significantly increased the day after initial rainfall, before returning to pre-rainfall conditions within 5 days. Phytoplankton biomass grew 10 fold within a week after initial rainfall in the 25-30 degrees C water and declined to near initial levels 2 weeks later. The assemblage of phytoplankton and zooplankton changed dramatically after 1 day and again by 6 days later, gradually returning to the original community by 2 weeks after the initial rainfall. Zooplankton responded within a day with a two fold increase in the adult stages of the calanoid copepod Oithona sp., followed a week later by nauplii and adult Acartia bispinosa. The influx of adult Oithona indicates resting populations that were previously under sampled by our plankton net. The plankton community returned to the initial state by 2 weeks, to being dominated by a centric diatom and A. bispinosa after 5 weeks. Dilution of the lagoon reached a maximum of 0.25 d(-1), while growth rates of the phytoplankton population reached a maximum of 1 d(-1), and A. bispinosa nauplii growth of 2.5 d(-1). Declines in chlorophyll biomass from the maximum 10 mu g l(-1), at a rate of approximately 10% d(-1) are consistent with the modelled uptake by zooplankton. The nutrients from runoff, growth and the influx of new zooplankton into the water column, resulted in a depleted delta(13)C and delta(15)N stable isotope signature of A. bispinosa by 2-4 ppt within 1-2 weeks, consistent with diatom growth and the terrestrial supply of depleted nutrients. delta(34)S of A. bispinosa was enriched by 2 ppt for 1-2 weeks after rainfall, but unlike C and N, returned to pre-rainfall levels by the end of the study period. We suggest that plankton studies in coastal lakes with variable water levels that are not tidally driven, should account for the influence of changes in water levels to help explain data variability.

Effects of food-web structure on periphyton stoichiometry in eutrophic lakes:: a mesocosm study	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Aquatic herbivores typically have much higher concentrations of nutrients (e.g. N and P) in their tissues than there is in the food they eat. These stoichiometric differences can cause herbivores to be limited by the elemental quality of their food, which could affect, in turn, the structure of consumer communities and even alter key ecosystem processes. 2. In streams and in the littoral zone of shallow lakes, periphyton is an important food resource for benthic animals. Studying the elemental composition of periphyton may help us to understand food-web structure, and any reciprocal effect of this structure on periphyton stoichiometry. 3. To understand how alterations in the food-web structure affect the elemental composition of periphyton in a eutrophic lake, we carried out a long-term experiment (14 months) in large-scale mesocosms (40 m(3)), in which we manipulated food-web structure, and which were dominated either by planktivorous fish (Rutilus rutilus) or herbivorous invertebrates (without fish). Periphyton was sampled monthly at three depths (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m) to determine its biomass and elemental composition (C/N/P ratio). Food-web structure, physical and chemical parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. 4. Fish had indirect positive effect on periphyton biomass, leading to twofold higher levels than in herbivore-dominated mesocosms. This result was probably due to control of benthic consumers by fish, suggesting a strong top-down control on periphyton by their consumers in fishless enclosures. 5. The elemental ratios C/P and C/N were lower in deep water in both treatments, mainly mediated by light availability, in accordance with the light/nutrient ratio hypothesis. These ratios were also lower in fishless treatments, probably due to increases in inorganic nutrient availability and grazing pressure in herbivore-dominated systems. During winter, periphyton elemental composition was similar in both treatments, and was unrelated to inorganic nutrient availability. 6. These results indicate that any alteration of food-web structure in lakes, such as in biomanipulation experiments, is likely to modify both the biomass and elemental quality of periphyton. Resultant effects on the consumers of periphyton and macrophytes could play a key role in the success of biomanipulations and should be taken into account in further studies.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2008	53	10					2089	2100		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02031.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02031.x													WOS:000259148200014
J	Liu, HY; Gu, YH; Yu, JX; Zhang, HZ; Tang, XM				Liu, Hongye; Gu, Yansheng; Yu, Jianxin; Zhang, Huanzhou; Tang, Xiaoming			Late Pleistocene to early Holocene ENSO-related hydroclimatic changes revealed by palynological records from the coastal Xixi Basin, eastern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We report a palaeontological record for the last 37.0 cal kyr BP in the Xixi Basin, eastern China, to better understand the correlation between hydroclimatic change and vegetation history during the late Pleistocene to early Holocene. Principal component analysis based on the 25 main palynological taxa indicated that dominant taxa fall into three groups: conifers that preferred dry conditions on the left of leading principal component (PC) 1, ferns and wetland communities associated with a humid climate responding to the positive loading of PC1, and Quercus-dominated communities principally corresponding to PC2. Based on this analysis, hydroclimatic conditions were relatively warm/dry during the latter Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 with a high abundance of conifers. This was followed by a generally cold/wet MIS 2 with expansion of ferns and herbs, and a warm/dry MIS 1 with more evergreen species. The sporadic occurrence of evergreen species and drier conditions since about 19.0 cal kyr BP coincides with the beginning of the last deglaciation. An increase in sedimentary accumulation rates and changes in vegetation components at the onset of the Holocene are likely related to maximum transgression. Wet conditions coincide with several cold intervals, including Heinrich events and the Last Glacial Maximum. The overall warm/dry and cold/wet climatic patterns agree well with the palaeoclimatic records elsewhere in the middle Yangtze region, showing similar hydroclimatic forcing mechanisms related to the migration of the Meiyu Front modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities. Cold/wet conditions probably correspond to enhanced ENSO and reduced insolation while warm/dry conditions correspond to dampened ENSO and increased insolation. The extremely humid conditions that occur during cold events may result from the combined effects of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and ENSO. These results expand our understanding of the monsoonal hydroclimate in eastern China during the late Quaternary period.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 15	2022	608								111294	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111294		NOV 2022											WOS:000985489700002

The 2010 data from active monitors indicate average summertime diurnal maxima of approximately 50-55 ppb. Some site-to-site variability is observed within the Basin during the well-mixed hours of 10:00 to 17:00 PST, but large differences between different sites are observed in the late evening and pre-dawn hours. The observed trends correlate most strongly with elevation, topography, and surface vegetation. High elevation sites with steeply sloped topography and drier ground cover experience elevated O-3 concentrations throughout the night because they maintain good access to downward mixing of O-3-rich air from aloft with smaller losses due to dry deposition. Low elevation sites with flat topography and more dense surface vegetation experience low O-3 concentrations in the pre-dawn hours because of greatly reduced downward mixing coupled with enhanced O-3 removal via efficient dry deposition. Additionally, very high average O-3 concentrations were measured with passive samplers in the middle of the Lake in 2010. This latter result likely reflects diminished dry deposition to the surface of the Lake. High elevation Tahoe Basin sites with exposure to nocturnal O-3-rich air from aloft experience daily maxima of 8-h average O-3 concentrations that are frequently higher than concurrent maxima from the polluted upwind comparison sites of Sacramento, Folsom, and Placerville. Wind rose analyses of archived NAM 12 km meteorological data for the summer of 2010 suggest that some of the sampling sites situated near the shoreline may have experienced onshore "lake breezes" during daytime hours and/or off-shore "land breezes" during the night. Back-trajectory analysis with the HYSPLIT model suggests that much of the ozone measured at Lake Tahoe results from the transport of "polluted background" air into the Basin from upwind pollution source regions. Calculation of ozone exposure indices indicates that the two most polluted sites sampled by active monitors in 2010 the highest Genoa Peak site, located on the eastern side of the Lake at an elevation of 2734 m above sea level, and Angora Lookout, located to the south southwest (SSW) of the Lake at an elevation of 2218 m above sea level likely experienced some phytotoxic impacts, while the other Tahoe Basin locations received lower ozone exposures.

J	OJOH, KA				OJOH, KA			CRETACEOUS GEODYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE BENUE TROUGH (NIGERIA) IN THE EQUATORIAL DOMAIN OF THE SOUTH-ATLANTIC - STRATIGRAPHY, BASIN ANALYSIS AND PALEO-OCEANOGRAPHY	BULLETIN DES CENTRES DE RECHERCHES EXPLORATION-PRODUCTION ELF AQUITAINE												The Benue Trough is a geological megastructure which extends from the northern limit of the Tertiary Niger Delta to Lake Chad for over 1000 km northeastwards, in the African plate. The Albian to Coniacian sedimentary series of the Lower Benue Trough has been subdivided into eight stratigraphic units based on new biostratigraphic and sedimentologic data. It is comprised of two major sedimentary cycles. The first cycle is characterised by subaqueous gravity dynamics with megaslumps and turbidites. As an integral part of the Medio-African Rift System (MARS) in the proximity of the proto-Gulf of Guinea, basin instability or paroxysm was preponderant in the Albian basin with resediments. Rapid subsidence, initially localised in the deep asymmetric Abakaliki basin during the Albian, evolved to a slow rate in the Lower Cenomanian, simultaneously with basin infilling and eustatic fall of sea-level. The second sedimentary cycle is from the Upper Cenomanian to Coniacian. It corresponds to the installation of an extensive platform due to differential subsidence on the western part of the basin, dominated by shelf sedimentation. The Upper Cretaceous eustatic rise of sea-level is documented from condensed sections, tempestites and tidalites, during the convergence of the Tethysian trans-Saharan sea-way and the South Atlantic on the entire Benue Trough. The rapidly subsiding asymmetrical Albian basin with magmatic intrusions evolved to a matured platform stage during the Turonian and Coniacian, penecontemporaneous with the migration of new depocentres to the west in the Anambra basin. After the Santonian structural inversion phase, the uplifted Abakaliki region was then subjected to an important erosional phase during the Campanian. The Cretaceous rifting and initiation, shelf installation and stabilisation, then deformation of these intra-Benue basins, represent the evolutionary stages of an aulacogen. They have been influenced mainly by subsidence, sea-level changes and the rifting-drifting of South America from Africa in the equatorial domain of the South Atlantic, within the scope of global plate tectonics.																			0396-2687					DEC 4	1990	14	2					419	442																WOS:A1990EW27400003

In the absence of available vaccines, adoption of personal protective behaviors (PPB) recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is necessary for reducing the risk of TED infection when recreating in natural areas. Example PPBs include wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts, tucking pants into socks, using insect repellents on clothes and body, etc. Despite their established effectiveness, few people adopt these PPB and they remain unprotected against the risk of TBD. Few theory-driven studies have addressed factors affecting intention to engage in tick-borne disease personal protective behavior (TBL) PPB) among especially at risk-populations such as college students. This study investigated the efficacy of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting intention to engage in TBD PPB amongst visitors to the University of Florida's Lake Wauburg outdoor recreation center in North Central Florida. The intercept method was used to administer a 41-item survey to a random cross-section of visitors over a three-week period in the summer of 2014. Seventy-live percent of survey participants were college students. Fifty-one percent had previous contact with ticks, and of this number, 83% reported place of exposure as recreational. Eighty-one percent 'routinely check for ticks on skin and clothes,' 73%-choose to walk the center of trails,' 38% 'wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts, or light-colored clothing,' and 27% 'tuck pants into socks.' From multivariate logistic regression analysis, attitude toward TBD PPB was a significant predictor of the intention to adopt five different TBL) PPB. TBD perception within the survey respondents social circle was not a significant predictor of any TBD PPB. Respondents who agreed that there were health benefits of engaging in TBD PPB were significantly less likely to use tick repellents on skin or clothing, but they were significantly more likely to routinely check for licks on clothes or body. Study findings suggest that the Theory of Planned Behavior is effective for predicting the intention to engage in TED PPB. This study has implications for the planning, development and operationalization of TED policy, and prevention programs for Lake Wauburg and other nature-based outdoor recreation destinations where TBD presents a risk for visitors.

J	Farabaugh, RL; Rigsby, CA				Farabaugh, RL; Rigsby, CA			Climatic influence on sedimentology and geomorphology of the Rio Ramis Valley, Peru	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Fluctuations in regional precipitation and in base-level (the level of Lake Titicaca) trigger changes in fluvial erosion and deposition in the largest tributary valley of Lake Titicaca, the Rio Ramis, Peru. Relationships between fluvial sedimentation and terrace formation demonstrate that large-scale aggradational and downcutting events are associated with specific regional climatic events that have been previously documented in the Lake Titicaca basin and elsewhere on the Altiplano. Five laterally extensive terrace tracts (A through E) are present within the valley. Downcutting of the Ramis valley is correlative with base-level (Lake Titicaca level) fall caused by a decrease in precipitation. Aggradation is correlative with base-level rise during increasing precipitation. Sedimentary facies underlying the terraces record deposition in a large paleolake followed by deposition of both meandering and braided fluvial sediments. The highest terrace in the valley-E-is underlain by a thick sequence of lacustrine strata that was deposited during an extremely wet period in the Lake Titicaca region that terminated at about 40,000 cal yr BP. These lacustrine strata were subsequently downcut, likely at a time of large drop in lake-level, resulting in a deeply incised valley. The main phase of fluvial aggradation in the valley (sediments underlying the D through B terraces) was slow, spanning about 25,000 years. It occurred before, during, and after the Last Glacial Maximum (from before 35,140 +/- 790 cal yr BP until about 10,421 +/- 181 cal yr BP), a time period that was mostly characterized in the Lake Titicaca basin by high precipitation rates and high base-levels. The aggradation resulted in almost 40 in of sediment accumulation in the valley and was followed by rapid (about 2,000 years), but episodic, incision into the underlying fluvial sediments to form the C and B terraces, as well as the erosional surface beneath the modern fill terrace (A). This erosional phase corresponded to several periods of local base-level (Lake Titicaca) lowering between 10,241 +/- 181 and 1,668 +/- 76 cal yr BP. The modern fill terrace has aggraded about 2 in above modern river level, likely within the last 1,500 years.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				JAN	2005	75	1					12	28		10.2110/jsr.2005.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2005.003													WOS:000226330600003

The lockdown measures have led to significant changes in industrial activities, transportation, and human behavior. This study investigates how the lockdown measures influenced the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the sediments of Chaohu Lake, a semi-enclosed lake. Surface sediment samples were collected in summer of 2020 (lockdown have just been lifted) and 2022 and analyzed for 16 priority PAHs. The range of Sigma PAHs concentrations remained similar between 2020 (158.19-1693.64 ng center dot g- 1) and 2022 (148.86-1396.54 ng center dot g- 1). Among the sampling sites, the west lake exhibited similar PAHs concentrations characteristics over the two years, with higher levels observed in areas near Hefei City. However, the east lake exhibited increased Sigma PAHs concentrations in 2022 compared to 2020, especially the area near ship factory. PAHs source analysis using principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) revealed an increased proportion of petroleum combustion sources in 2022 compared to 2020. The isotope analysis results showed that organic matter (OM) sources in the western lake remained relatively stable over the two years, with sewage discharge dominating. In contrast, the eastern lake experienced a shift in OM sources from sewage to C3 plants, potentially contributing to the increased PAH levels observed in the eastern lake sediments. Ecological risk assessment revealed low to moderate risk in both 2020 and 2022. Health risk evaluation indicated little difference in incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values between the two years, with only benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) posing a high risk among the carcinogenic PAHs. Children generally faced higher health risks compared to adults. This study reveals pandemic-induced changes in PAH pollution and sources in lake sediments, offering new insights into the impact of human activities on persistent organic pollutants, with implications for future pollution control strategies.

J	Santer, B; Hansen, AM				Santer, B; Hansen, AM			Diapause of Cyclops vicinus (Uljanin) in Lake Sobygard: indication of a risk-spreading strategy	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Cyclops vicinus is reported to enter summer diapause triggered by day length in order to survive food scarcity and fish predation. Development ceases and the fourth or fifth copepodid stages persist in the sediment for several weeks. In Lake Sobygard, however, a small eutrophic lake in Denmark, C. vicinus is found in the sediment as well as in the open water throughout the year. We performed laboratory experiments to elucidate the life cycle strategy of this population. In order to find the factors that induce diapause we tested the influence of food composition and light regime on the proportion of copepods entering diapause. Further we examined the diapause pattern of the offspring from diapausing and non-diapausing parents to see whether the co-occurrence of diapausing and non-diapausing copepods results from genetic differentiation within the population. In all experiments some of the copepods developed directly into adults, while others remained at the fourth or fifth copepodid stage and displayed diapause features. The proportion of copepods that developed directly into adults was influenced by food supply. Fewer individuals entered diapause when they received a mixed diet of algae and ciliates or algae, ciliates and seston compared with a pure algal diet. The response to light was different than described in literature: about 30% of the copepods entered diapause under dark conditions, and the diapause frequency was not higher when copepods had been exposed to continuous light. The offspring from diapausing parents showed no higher tendency to enter diapause than the offspring of non-diapausing parents, indicating no genetic differentiation. We conclude that diapause in C. vicinus represents a risk-spreading strategy, modified by food. The simultaneous production of diapausing and non-diapausing offspring ensures survival under harsh conditions; the influence of the food supply on the proportion of individuals entering diapause may adjust the population to the actual environmental condition. This flexible life cycle strategy might contribute to the exclusive dominance of C. vicinus in Lake sobygard.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2006	560						217	226		10.1007/s10750-005-1067-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1067-7													WOS:000236092500016
J	Bird, GA; Hesslein, RH; Mills, KH; Schwartz, WJ; Turner, MA				Bird, GA; Hesslein, RH; Mills, KH; Schwartz, WJ; Turner, MA			Bioaccumulation of radionuclides in fertilized Canadian Shield lake basins	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Radionuclide tracers of heavy metals (Fe-59, Co-60, Zn-65, Se-75 Sr-85 Cs-134 and Hg-203) representing potential contamination from nuclear power plants, industry and agriculture were added to separate basins of Lake 226, Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario. The two basins were part of a eutrophication experiment and differed in their trophic status; the north basin (L226N) was eutrophic whereas the south basin (L226S) was mesotrophic. Our objective was to determine the uptake of the radionuclides by biota and the effect of lake trophic status on their bioaccumulation. The trophic status of the lakes did not appear to have a marked effect on the accumulation of radionuclides by the biota. This may have been because of a mid-summer leakage of nutrients between the basins which enhanced primary production in L226S, because there is a time lag between primary production and the availability of the radionuclides to the fishes or because trophic status does not affect the uptake of at least some of these radionuclides. However, there was a tendency for faster uptake of the radionuclides in L226N by fish than L226S, but the differences were not significant. Concentrations in the biota generally decreased in the order: fathead minnow > pearl dace > tadpoles > slimy sculpin > leeches. Concentrations in biota generally decreased in the order: Zn-65 > Hg-203 > Se-75 > Cs-134 > Co-60 > Sr-85 = Fe-59. Cobalt-60 concentrations in tadpoles were greater than in the other biota. Radionuclide concentrations in the tissues of lake whitefish indicated that uptake was predominantly from food. Radionuclide concentrations were usually higher in the posterior gut, liver and kidney than in other tissues, whereas body burdens were generally high in the muscle for Se-75, Cs-134 and Hg-203; kidney and gut for Co-60; and bone for Zn-65 and Se-75. Mercury-203 burdens were also high in the bone and gut. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Smith, ID; Bis, GN; Lemon, ER; Rozema, LR				Smith, ID; Bis, GN; Lemon, ER; Rozema, LR			A thermal analysis of a sub-surface, vertical flow constructed wetland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					5th International Conference on Wetland Systems for Water Pollution Control	SEP 15-19, 1996	VIENNA, AUSTRIA	Univ Bodenkultur, IAWQ, Austrian Minist Environm & Agr Forestry, City Vienna, Local Govt Lower Austria, Local Govt Upper Austria, Local Govt Styria				Since November of 1991, an experimental constructed wetland has successfully treated municipal sewage effluent on a year round basis in a cool climate. The sub-surface, vertically pulsed flow system is located at a latitude of approximately 43 degrees, 15 minutes north latitude in south-central Canada. The 5 metre long by 5 metre wide by 1.2 metre deep constructed wetland cells were designed to operate through extended freezing periods via a number of specific features. The most important features being the allowance of thatch accumulation atop the system, ice accretion within the upper cell strata both acting as insulating layers, and the transfer of thermal energy to the system from warmer deep soils. The cells were hydraulically loaded below this frozen layer of granular matrix six times a day. A dense three dimensional array of thermocouples was planted within the first of the three constructed wetland cells in a series to allow for the assessment of thermal data at a high level of temporal and spatial resolution. Thermal data were sampled every five minutes and averaged and stored every hour over a two year period (1994 and 1995). The data were reviewed statistically to determine the operating envelope experienced at the Niagara-On-The-Lake experimental constructed wetland site. A detailed review of winter thermal data was made to provide parameters for the use of the HEATFLOW density-dependent ground water flow and thermal energy transport numerical model (Molson and Frind, 1995). The use of this coupled Darcy flux, thermal transport model has allowed for a better understanding of the importance of various thermal design considerations, and has allowed for the undertaking of sensitivity analyses for design assessment and optimization. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the retention of deep soil heat and top insulation from plant thatch are the most important thermal features. It is likely that this technology can be used in areas colder than Niagara-On-The-Lake. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

J	Sagrario, MDG; Balseiro, E				Gonzalez Sagrario, Maria de los Angeles; Balseiro, Esteban			The role of macroinvertebrates and fish in regulating the provision by macrophytes of refugia for zooplankton in a warm temperate shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The zooplankton often undergoes diel horizontal migration (DHM) from the open water to the littoral of shallow lakes, thus avoiding predators in the former. This behaviour has functional impacts within the lake, as it enhances zooplankton survival, increases their control of phytoplankton and tends to stabilise the clear water state. However, most of the evidence supporting this migration pattern comes from cold north temperate lakes, and more evidence from tropical and subtropical areas, as well as from southern temperate areas, is needed. 2. We conducted a field study of the diel horizontal and vertical migration of zooplankton, and the horizontal distribution of potential predatory macroinvertebrates and fish, over two consecutive days in the summer in a temperate lake in the southern hemisphere. We took zooplankton samples at two depths, at three sampling stations (inside beds of aquatic macrophytes, at their edge and in open water) along three transects running from the centre of a bed of Ceratophyllum demersum to open water. At each sampling station, we also took samples of macroinvertebrates and fish and measured physical and chemical environmental variables. 3. Zooplankton (pelagic cladocerans, calanoid copepods and rotifers) avoided the shore, probably because of the greater risk from predators there. Larger and more vulnerable cladocerans, such as Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Moina micrura, were two to four times more abundant in open water than at the edge of or inside beds of macrophytes, respectively, by both day and night. Less vulnerable zooplankton [i.e. of medium body size (Ceriodaphnia dubia) or with the ability to swim fast (calanoid copepods)] were distributed evenly between open water and the edge of the plant beds. Small zooplankton, Bosmina huaronensis and pelagic rotifers, showed an even distribution among the three sampling stations. Accordingly, no DHM of zooplankton occurred, although larger organisms migrated vertically inside C. demersum stands. 4. Macrophytes contained high densities of predatory macroinvertebrates and fish. The predator assemblage, composed of large-bodied macroinvertebrates (including odonates and shrimps) and small littoral fish, was permanently associated with submerged macrophytes. None of these groups moved outside the plant beds or changed their population structure (fish) over the diel cycle. 5. Submerged macrophyte beds do not represent a refuge for zooplankton in lakes where predators are numerous among the plants, implying a weaker top-down control of phytoplankton biomass by zooplankton and, consequently, a more turbid lake. The effectiveness of macrophytes as a refuge for zooplankton depends on the associated assemblage of predatory macroinvertebrates and fish among the plants.

In order to gain a greater understanding of the carbon cycling in the lake we attempted to measure sulphate reduction in the summer of 1994, but rates were below detectable limits of 1.2 x 10(6) mol sulphate yr(-1). Therefore sulphate reduction was estimated by calculating the rate of sulphide diffusion from the anoxic zone. Sulphate reduction rates were estimated to be 17.7 x 10(3) mol sulphate yr(-1), accounting for 30% of planktonic primary production over the whole lake, but over 100% of primary productivity in the deep chlorophyll maximum. Radiocarbon dating of organic matter in the sediment (565 +/- 50 yr BP), suggests that little new organic carbon reaches the sediment from the upper water column. Oxygen diffusion into the anoxic zone could account for only 44% of sulphide reoxidation; therefore, alternative oxidizing potential presumably accounted for the remainder. Sulphate concentration may be controlled by the solubility limit for a mineral phase, perhaps gypsum, as it shows a positive correlation with conductivity, The sulphur species in the anoxic zone are highly enriched in S-34 (sulphate delta S-34 = +42 to +46%, sulphide delta S-34 = +13.9%) which may be explained by either selective removal of sulphide at the oxic/anoxic interface by precipitation of metal sulphides or previous loss of H2S to the atmosphere. While sulphate reduction is an important part of the carbon cycle within the lake, the oligotrophic nature of Lake Vanda means that all microbiological process rates are very low. The data presented suggest a dynamic and complex history for Lake Vanda and are entirely consistent with present theories of the lake's history.

J	LINDSTROM, EA				LINDSTROM, EA			PERIPHYTON INVESTIGATIONS IN HUMEX LAKE SKJERVATJERN IN 1992	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												During the first year of artificial acidification of the dystrophic Lake Skjervatjern with a combination of sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate, extensive growth of filamentous green algae occurred in the acidified half. Therefore, investigations studying the effect of acidified humic water on periphyton started early 1992. Quantitative measurements in the two lake-halves (acidified-A, control-B) were carried out, using small clay flower pots as growth substrates. The pots were placed in the two lake halves at 0.5 and 2 m depth. During the first three months, accumulated periphyton, measured as dry weight and chlorophyll a, was 50-600% higher in the acidified basin A than in B. Chlorophyll a per unit dry weight was higher in A than B, indicating higher photosynthetic activity in the acidified half. C/N-ratios in freeze-dried material from basin A were 10-11, indicating little or no N-deficiency during the first three months of the experiment at both 0.5 and 2 m depth in the acidified half. In the control basin B, C/N-ratios between 15 and 19 indicated N-deficiency during the first three months of the experiment at 0.5 m depth. At 2 m, there was no growth in basin B for the first 56 d of the experiment. After three months, periphyton accrual at 2 m had approximately the same chlorophyll a per unit dry weight and C/N-ratios as in basin A. This indicated that conditions in basin 13 at 2 m depth changes from strong growth limitations early in the summer to high photosynthetic activity and little or no N-limitation later in the year. The bluegreen alga Hapalosiphon fontinalis (Ag.)Born. is known to fix elemental nitrogen. It proliferated in the control basin, but was scarce in the acidified half. This supported the assumption of nitrogen limitation in the control basin.																			0160-4120						1994	20	3					321	328		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90116-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(94)90116-3													WOS:A1994NM12900008
J	Kushnir, Y; Stein, M				Kushnir, Yochanan; Stein, Mordechai			North Atlantic influence on 19th-20th century rainfall in the Dead Sea watershed, teleconnections with the Sahel, and implication for Holocene climate fluctuations	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The importance of understanding processes that govern the hydroclimate of the Mediterranean Basin is highlighted by the projected significant drying of the region in response to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we study the long-term hydroclimatic variability of the central Levant region, situated in the eastern boundary of the Basin, as reveled by instrumental observations and the Holocene record of Dead Sea level variations. Observations of 19th and 20th century precipitation in the Dead Sea watershed region display a multidecadal, anti-phase relationship to North Atlantic (NAtl) sea surface temperature (SST) variability, such that when the NAtl is relatively cold, Jerusalem experiences higher than normal precipitation and vice versa. This association is underlined by a negative correlation to precipitation in the sub-Saharan Sahel and a positive correlation to precipitation in western North America, areas that are also affected by multidecadal NAtl SST variability. These observations are consistent with a broad range of Holocene hydroclimatic fluctuations from the epochal, to the millennial and centennial time scales, as displayed by the Dead Sea lake level, by lake levels in the Sahel, and by direct and indirect proxy indicators of NAtl SSTs. On the epochal time scale, the gradual cooling of NAtl SSTs throughout the Holocene in response to precession-driven reduction of summer insolation is associated with previously well-studied wet-to-dry transition in the Sahel and with a general increase in Dead Sea lake levels from low stands after the Younger Dryas to higher stands in the mid- to late-Holocene. On the millennial and centennial time scales there is also evidence for an anti-phase relationship between Holocene variations in the Dead Sea and Sahelian lake levels and with proxy indicators of NAtl SSTs. However the records are punctuated by abrupt lake-level drops, which appear to be in-phase and which occur during previously documented abrupt major cooling events in the Northern Hemisphere. We propose that the mechanisms by which NAtl SSTs affect precipitation in the central Levant is related to the tendency for high (low) pressure anomalies to persist over the eastern North Atlantic/Western Mediterranean region when the Basin is cold (warm). This, in turn, affects the likelihood of cold air outbreaks and cyclogenesis in the Eastern Mediterranean and, consequently, rainfall in the central Levant region. Depending on its phase, this natural mechanism can alleviate or exacerbate the anthropogenic impact on the regions' hydroclimatic future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, F; Zhuang, YR; Dong, BQ; Wu, J				Wang, Fan; Zhuang, Yiru; Dong, Bingqi; Wu, Jing			Review on Per- and Poly-Fluoroalkyl Substances' (PFASs') Pollution Characteristics and Possible Sources in Surface Water and Precipitation of China	WATER												In recent years, due to the production and use of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the research on the pollution characteristics and sources of PFASs in surface water and precipitation in China has attracted increasing attention. In this study, the related published articles with sampling years from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed, and the concentration levels, composition characteristics and possible sources of PFASs in surface water (rivers and lakes) and precipitation in China were summarized, including those in the Tibetan Plateau region. The results show that the concentrations of PFASs in surface water in different areas of China vary greatly, ranging from 0.775 to 1.06 x 10(6) ng/L. The production processes of fluorinated manufacturing facilities (FMFs) and sewage discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) were the main sources of PFASs in surface water in China, and the concentrations of PFASs in water flowing through cities with high urbanization increased significantly compared with those before water flowed through cities with high urbanization. The compositions of PFASs in surface water gradually changed from long-chain PFASs, such as per-fluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) and per-fluoro-octanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to short-chain PFASs, such as per-fluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), per-fluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and per-fluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA). The concentrations of PFASs in precipitation in China ranged from 4.2 to 191 ng/L, which were lower than those of surface water. The precipitation concentrations were relatively high around a fluorination factory and in areas with high urbanization levels. PFASs were detected in the surface water and precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is the global "roof of the world", but the concentrations were low (0.115-6.34 ng/L and 0.115-1.24 ng/L, respectively). Local human activities and surface runoff were the main sources of PFASs in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, under the influence of the Southeast Asian monsoon in summers, marine aerosols from the Indian Ocean and air pollutants from human activities in Southeast Asia and South Asia will also enter the water bodies through dry and wet depositions. With the melting of glaciers caused by global warming, the concentration of PFASs in the surface water of the TP was higher than that before the melting of glaciers flowed into the surface water of the TP. Generally, this study summarized the existing research progress of PFAS studies on surface water and precipitation in China and identified the research gaps, which deepened the researchers' understanding of this field and provided scientific support for related research in the future. The concentrations of PFASs in the water bodies after flowing through FMFs were significantly higher than those before water flowed through FMFs, so the discharge of the FMF production process was one of the main sources of PFASs in surface water.

J	Hardmeier, F; Schmidheiny, N; Suremann, J; Lüthi, M; Vieli, A				Hardmeier, Florian; Schmidheiny, Nicolas; Suremann, Jeannine; Luthi, Martin; Vieli, Andreas			Evolution, sedimentation and thermal state of the emerging pro-glacial lakes at Witenwasserengletscher, Switzerland	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												As glaciers retreat worldwide, local basal depressions are exposed where new pro-glacial lakes are forming. Although the formation of such new lakes has been mapped widely, the impact of their interaction with the glacier on sediment dynamics and the thermal state is rarely studied. At the example of Witenwasserengletscher, Switzerland, we use historic aerial imagery and a bathymetric survey to investigate in detail the interaction of glacier retreat, lake formation and sedimentation. Three lakes have emerged since the mid-1990s with mean depths between 1.25 and 6 m. The deepest lake lost contact to the ice in 2009 with a delta forming from mobilized sub-glacial sediment. Phases of direct contact of the glacier with the lakes are found to increase terminus retreat and affect the thermal state and sedimentation. In summer, lake water temperatures in these small ice-contact lakes stay close to 0 degrees C, whereas the disconnected eastern lake shows temperatures consistently over 6 degrees C. Temperature profiles from 2021 show that after losing ice contact, warm sediment-rich glacial water forms an underflow that is breaking through the summertime stratification with warm water over cold water. In this case, density stratification is dominated by suspended sediment rather than temperature. Sedimentation shows a high multiannual variability and is dependent on a multitude of factors, ultimately on the routing of glacial streams. These tend to migrate towards the centre of the valley as the glacier retreats. Our study shows that during deglaciation lake evolution, sediment redistribution and the thermal state are highly dynamic and pro-glacial lakes strongly affect the sediment evolution and may thereby impact on the ecosystem in pro-glacial streams. This study investigates the emergence of glacial lakes and its impact on sedimentation in the pro-glacial area of Witenwasserengletscher, Switzerland. Aerial imagery and bathymetric surveys reveal a strong influence from ice-lake contact on glacier retreat and the thermal regime and show that sedimentation is highly dynamic.image					; Lüthi, Martin/AAA-3668-2021; Vieli, Andreas/A-6767-2011	Vieli, Andreas/0000-0002-2870-5921; Hardmeier, Florian/0000-0002-8569-6662; Luthi, Martin Peter/0000-0003-4419-8496													0197-9337	1096-9837				SEP 30	2024	49	12					4055	4073		10.1002/esp.5941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5941		AUG 2024											WOS:001281903300001

During these events, almost 2000 people were asphyxiated, making the carbon dioxide outburst one of the most murderous volcanic hazards in the recent past. The volcanic district of the French Massif central (Auvergne) exposes volcanic structures (crater lakes) similar to those in Cameroon (lake Monoun and Lake Nyos) from which poison gas erupted. On request from the French Committee for Prevention of Volcanic Hazards (CSERV), the Research Centre for Volcanology at Clermont-Ferrand (CRV) reported on the possibilities of poison gas ourbursts in France. The conclusions of the report were the following : (1) the volcanic activity could obviously resume in France, although volcanoes have been asleep for the last 6,000 years; it is nevertheless expected that next volcanic events should be heralded by typical sismo-volcanic activity, not yet recorded ; (2) hydrothermal explosions, although very scarce, occurred in a recent past and should be considered as an actual hazard; (3) large scale CO2 outburst of limnic origin could only be expected from one single crater lake (lake Pavin); more confidence must be drawn from determination of CO2 concentration profile in the water of this lake. An extensive new geochemical study of lake Pavin was supported by the DRM in 1986. Concentrations of H-3, CO2, Ar, O2, N2, CH4 were determined at several depths, as well as pH, deltaO-18, and deltaC-13. A rather accurate model of the hydrological balance of the lake was drawn from these data which have also shown that carbon in the water (CH4 + CO2) is mostly derived from organic activity; mantle derived carbon represents only a very low input, probably related to weak hydrothermal springs. The whole concentration Of CO2 dissolved in water is less than 0,37 litre STP litre-1. On the basis of the latter observation it is considered that poison gas outburst of limnic origin (upset and ebullition of CO2-rich water from the monimolimnion) is not to be held today as a realistic hazard in the French Massif central.

Relationships among total recoverable and reactive metals and metalloid in St. Lawrence River sediment: Bioaccumulation by chironomids and implications for ecological risk assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The availability and bioaccumulation of metals and metalloids, and the geochemical among them, are essential to developing an ecological risk assessment (ERA) framework determining threshold concentrations for these elements. The purpose of this study was explore the relationships among total recoverable and reactive metals and metalloid in and their bioaccumulation by chironomids. in the fall of 2004 and 2005, 58 stations located in three fluvial lakes of the St. Lawrence River and its largest harbour area in Montreal, Canada, sampled. Nine total recoverable and reactive metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and metalloid (As) were measured in whole sediment using two extraction methods: HCl/HNO3 HCl 1N, respectively. The bioaccumulation of six metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and As chironomids was evaluated in a subset of 22 stations. Strong collinearities were observed between some total recoverable or reactive metal concentrations in sediment; two principal clusters, including collinear metals, were obtained. The first one included metals of mainly geological origin (Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni), while the second one included As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, which likely derive mainly from point sources of anthropogenic contamination. Each element also showed collinearity between their total recoverable and reactive forms (0.65 <= r <= 0.97). We can conclude that both chemical forms are equivalent for use in statistical models needed to explain biological responses and also in screening risk assessment. However, these relationships are not always proportional. Lower availability percentages were observed for Cd, Cu and Zn in the highly mixed-contaminated area of the Montreal Harbour, even though concentrations in sediment were higher. We observed a significant correlation (0.50 <= r <= 0.56) between concentrations in chironomids and concentrations of both total recoverable and reactive Cr and Pb in sediment. Arsenic was an exception, with accumulation by chironomids being highly related to reactive sediment concentrations. Finally, we observed variable influences of explanatory factors (e.g. sediment grain size, Al, Fe, Mn, S, TOC), depending on which metal or metalloid was being predicted in chironomids. In this context, it is difficult to choose a universal predictive method to explain the bioaccumulation of specific metals, and more research is still needed into normalization procedures that consider a combination of explanatory factors.

However, only limited data sets are available to decipher large multistage rock-slope failures in detail. Here we apply sedimentology, radiocarbon dating, and geophysics to reconstruct multistage rock-slope failure recorded in lake sediments. We present a unique inventory from Lake Oeschinen (Bernese Alps, Switzerland) covering similar to 2.5kyr of rock-slope failure history. The lake sediments have been investigated using sediment-core analysis, radiocarbon dating, and seismic-to-core and core-to-core correlations, which were linked to (pre-) historic and meteorological records. The results imply that the lake in its present extent is significantly younger than the similar to 9.5-kyr-old Kandersteg rock avalanche in the close vicinity. Up to eleven rock-slope failure events could be identified and related to specific detachment scarps, which provided information for energy considerations. Four events likely coincided with (pre-) historic earthquakes. At least six events detached from the same area, potentially initiated by prehistoric seismicity and later from stress-relaxation processes. The data imply unexpected high recurrence rates (similar to 1/300years) and also help to understand the generation of a historical lake-outburst flood. Here we show how polymethodical analysis of lake sediments can help to decipher massive multistage rock-slope failures, which are often camouflaged in subaerial settings. Plain Language Summary Rock-slope failures account for two thirds of the most catastrophic landslide events in the last millennium. A key question is how often catastrophic rock-slope failures happen, but single rock-slope failure deposits can hardly be distinguished because failed rock material may fall onto and partially cover older deposits. Hence, the frequency of rock-slope failures is often highly underestimated. Preserved in a lake, the event deposits can be deciphered in time and space because the lake consistently records environmental changes and events and acts as a natural chronometer. This study at Lake Oeschinen in Switzerland shows that at least eleven rock-slope failures occurred around the lake over the last similar to 2.5 thousand years. The results imply that the lake is much younger and that the dam is built by at least six rock-slope failure deposits rather than by one or two, as previously thought. We also calculated the seismic trigger potential of well-known earthquakes in the region and found four earthquakes which might have prepared or triggered rock-slope failures around Lake Oeschinen.

Climate variability in northern Africa during the late Holocene: A multiproxy perspective from El-Beida Lake (Wadi El-Natrun, Egypt)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												North Africa is a key region hosting ca. 230 million people that are dependent on climate to maintain their subsistence through agriculture. Because of the current global changes, understanding the mechanisms behind the climate variations that occurred in this region is extremely important. To contribute to a more accurate modelling projection, we reconstructed the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental variations from the Meghalayan (-1,500 ka) to recent using palynological and geochemical data from a sediment core from El-Beida Lake (Wadi El-Natrun area, north Western Desert of Egypt). North Africa underwent significant shifts in climatic conditions forced by different drivers since the Roman Warm Period (RWP) until recent. Our sediment core record indicates that this region experienced a persistent dry and warm climate during the RWP until the first half of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). The positive North Atlantic Oscillation was the main driver for controlling the precipitation pattern and pushing the precipitation towards central and north Europe and favoring the dry climate in North Africa during the RWP. The dry and slightly cold conditions in the study area during the Dark Age Cold Period (DACP) can be ascribed to the coupling between the more southward position of the Azores Front and the weak Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Northern Africa showed variable climatic conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) due to the complicated thermohaline circulation of the Mediterranean Sea. During this time, the Eastern Mediterranean experienced a cold or partially cold MCA that may be extended to the present study area. An abrupt change to humid and cold climatic conditions occurred in northern Africa during the Little Ice Age (LIA) due to large-scale processes like the ENSO and NAO. The SST warming of the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA), significantly influenced by ENSO, causes the position of the Atlantic ITCZ to be shifted northward affecting precipitation in Africa.

The thickness and abundance of the stromatolitic horizons increase up the section. In the siliciclastic portion of the section, a very poor and taxonomically impoverished assemblage of benthic foraminifers (Jadammina, Nonion, Haynesina, Astrononion and Eponides) is recorded. It is typical for a shallow water marsh or lagoon environment with a lowered salinity. Accordingly, the brackish conditions prevailing during gypsum precipitation in East Crimea continued afterwards, although at the end of evaporite deposition the basin became desiccated and then it was rapidly reflooded by brackish water. The impoverished biota and the occurrence of microbialites in the Ptashkino section indicate extremely unfavourable conditions for most living organisms during the deposition of both the terrigenous and carbonate beds. The water salinity thus was probably not only lowered but also anomalous in composition if compared to normal marine water. The occurrence of carbonate stromatolitic horizons is probably related to the periodic shallowing of the basin caused by a drop of the lake water table driven by climatic factors. The resulted changes allowed for a growth of the bizarre microbial-serpulid communities that gave birth to most of the stromatolites. In Karaganian time, the Eastern Paratethys was a huge lake isolated from the Tethys. This lake responded to any climatic fluctuation that in turn might lead to water level oscillations. In humid climate periods, the lake could be open with a surface outflow and, when it was drier, it could be a closed system without surface outflow. Gypsum evaporites and stromatolitic carbonates are clear evidence of strong evaporation in a dry climate that probably induced water level fall in the whole basin. However, all the time the environmental conditions were predominantly brackish, even during gypsum precipitation as suggested by the chemical composition of fluid inclusions in gypsum. Similar conditions may be expected in other evaporite-hosted, predominantly brackish basins, such as some Messinian basins of the eastern Mediterranean, where some evaporites were deposited in the oligohaline to mesohaline conditions typical of the Lago Mare deposits.

J	Rodusky, AJ; Sharfstein, B; East, TL; Maki, RP				Rodusky, AJ; Sharfstein, B; East, TL; Maki, RP			A comparison of three methods to collect submerged aquatic vegetation in a shallow lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Two boat-based and one in-water sampling method have been used to collect submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) as part of a long-term monitoring program in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA. The boat-based methods consisted of collecting SAV with a ponar dredge, used only to collect Chara, and an oyster tongs-like rake apparatus, used to collect all SAV. The in-water method involved use of a 0.5 m(2) PVC quadrat frame deployed by a diver. During summer 2002, SAV biomass samples were collected using all three methods at various sites in the lake to compare between-methods sampling precision. Sites used for these comparisons were selected based on plant type, plant density and sediment type. Statistical comparisons indicated that there were significant (p <= 0.05) biomass differences in 8 of 15 possible pairwise comparisons between sampling method biomass means. In four of the eight comparisons, significantly higher biomass mean values were obtained using the quadrat frame. In three of the remaining four comparisons, significantly higher biomass mean values were obtained with the rake apparatus. For the fourth comparison, a significantly higher biomass mean value was obtained with the ponar dredge. Three of the four relationships between SAV biomass collected by the rake and the quadrat and the rake and the quadrat/ponar dredge were statistically significant, linear and explained between 67 and 78% of the biomass variability. There were no significant differences between regression coefficients or elevations for these relationships, therefore these regressions estimated the same population regression. The population regression coefficient was 0.95, suggesting that the quadrat and ponar over-sampled relative to the rake, but the amount of this over-sampling was very small. Since there was no consistent pattern in the sampling method which yielded the significantly different biomass values and there were no significant differences in sampling precision across a range of plant species, plant densities and two sediment types, the boat-based rake method appears to be a suitable replacement for the previously used ponar dredge and quadrat methods, when in-lake measurements are not practical.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2005	110	1-3					87	97		10.1007/s10661-005-6338-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-6338-2								16308780					WOS:000233529000005
J	Wolf-Grosse, T; Esau, I; Reuder, J				Wolf-Grosse, Tobias; Esau, Igor; Reuder, Joachim			Sensitivity of local air quality to the interplay between small- and large-scale circulations: a large-eddy simulation study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Street-level urban air pollution is a challenging concern for modern urban societies. Pollution dispersion models assume that the concentrations decrease monotonically with raising wind speed. This convenient assumption breaks down when applied to flows with local recirculations such as those found in topographically complex coastal areas. This study looks at a practically important and sufficiently common case of air pollution in a coastal valley city. Here, the observed concentrations are determined by the interaction between large-scale topographically forced and local-scale breeze-like recirculations. Analysis of a long observational dataset in Bergen, Norway, revealed that the most extreme cases of recurring wintertime air pollution episodes were accompanied by increased large-scale wind speeds above the valley. Contrary to the theoretical assumption and intuitive expectations, the maximum NO2 concentrations were not found for the lowest 10m ERA-Interim wind speeds but in situations with wind speeds of 3ms(-1). To explain this phenomenon, we investigated empirical relationships between the large-scale forcing and the local wind and air quality parameters. We conducted 16 large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments with the Parallelised Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) for atmospheric and oceanic flows. The LES accounted for the realistic relief and coastal configuration as well as for the large-scale forcing and local surface condition heterogeneity in Bergen. They revealed that emerging local breeze-like circulations strongly enhance the urban ventilation and dispersion of the air pollutants in situations with weak large-scale winds. Slightly stronger large-scale winds, however, can counteract these local recirculations, leading to enhanced surface air stagnation. Furthermore, this study looks at the concrete impact of the relative configuration of warmer water bodies in the city and the major transport corridor. We found that a relatively small local water body acted as a barrier for the horizontal transport of air pollutants from the largest street in the valley and along the valley bottom, transporting them vertically instead and hence diluting them. We found that the stable stratification accumulates the street-level pollution from the transport corridor in shallow air pockets near the surface. The polluted air pockets are transported by the local recirculations to other less polluted areas with only slow dilution. This combination of relatively long distance and complex transport paths together with weak dispersion is not sufficiently resolved in classical air pollution models. The findings have important implications for the air quality predictions over urban areas. Any prediction not resolving these, or similar local dynamic features, might not be able to correctly simulate the dispersion of pollutants in cities.					; Esau, Igor/AAG-9769-2021	Wolf, Tobias/0000-0001-6004-2374; Reuder, Joachim/0000-0002-0802-4838													1680-7316	1680-7324				JUN 16	2017	17	11					7261	7276		10.5194/acp-17-7261-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7261-2017													WOS:000403779200007

The geochronology of the sequence is derived from two age-depth models which show a broad measure of agreement over much of the profile. This data set provides the basis for a detailed reconstruction of changing environmental conditions in western Britain during the transition from the Last Cold Stage to the present (Holocene) interglacial (ca 15,000-10,000 cal yr BP). Two marked cooling episodes are recorded during the course of the Lateglacial Interstadial (Greenland Interstadial 1), with mean July temperatures falling by more than 5degreesC from a maximum of around 20degreesC during the early Interstadial, and by a further 4-5degreesC around 13,100 cal yr BP. The initial drop in temperature led to a reduction in Juniperus scrub, while the second, and more abrupt temperature decline resulted in a significant contraction in areas of Betula woodland. A relatively slight and short-lived warming during the later Interstadial enabled tree birch to expand once again. Mean July temperatures of 10-11degreesC characterised the Loch Lomond/Younger Dryas Stadial (Greenland Stadial 1) between ca 12,600 and 11,400 cal yr BP, during which time a scrub tundra with Betula, Salix and a range of open-habitat taxa became established locally. The onset of the Holocene Interglacial at ca 11,400 cal yr BP is marked by an abrupt temperature rise of the order of 9degreesC, and by the rapid expansion of Betula woodland. The Llanilid palaeoclimate record is similar to that from the Gransmoor site in northeast England, and also to the climatic sequence inferred from the GRIP ice core, particularly during the later part of the Lateglacial Interstadial (ca 14,000-12,600 cal yr BP), during the Loch Lomond/Younger Dryas Stadial and in the early Holocene. The Llanilid chronology is less secure during the early part of the Lateglacial Interstadial (pre-14,000 cal yr BP), but it is possible that warming may have begun earlier in this part of western Britain than in Greenland.

J	Teller, JT; Risberg, J; Matile, G; Zoltai, S				Teller, JT; Risberg, J; Matile, G; Zoltai, S			Postglacial history and paleoecology of Wampum, Manitoba, a former lagoon in the Lake Agassiz basin	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												A small paleolagoon along the margin of the glacial Lake Algassiz basin near Wampum, Manitoba, 130 km southeast of Winnipeg, contains an unusually thick and continuous sequence of late-glacial and Holocene organic sediment. Cores at 17 sites through this sequence provide insight into the fluctuations of the level of Lake Agassiz, the timing of the construction of the lake's most extensive strandline (the Upper Campbell beach), and the paleoecology of this area during the past 10 000 C-14 yr. The history of this area is established from 26 new AMS radiocarbon dates, siliceous microfossils, plant macrofossils, mineralogy; sediment characteristics, and stratigraphic relationships. Following deglaciation at Wampum about 11 C-14 ka, deposition of largely unfossiliferous silty clay with occasional ice-rafted clasts represents relatively deep-water conditions in Lake Agassiz. Overlying this is a spatially and temporally variable mixture of silt, sand, peat, gyttja, and marl, containing an allochthonous assemblage of siliceous microfossils and plant macrofossils with a wide range of radiocarbon dates. These sediments were deposited in an embayment of Lake A gassiz, mainly in shallow, quiet waters, as the lake transgressed about 10 ka over the Moorhead low-water phase surface, Between about 9.7 and 9.3 ka, the Wampum embayment was progressively isolated from Lake Agassiz by growth of the Upper Campbell spit, resulting in the formation of a lagoon. Organic-rich deposits on the lakeward side of the lagoon were buried 9.3-9.4 ka by sand and gravel of the spit, and a thin overwash of sand marks this event throughout the lagoon. At about this time, Lake Agassiz fell below the Upper Campbell beach level. Subsequent accumulation at Wampum consists mainly of algal gyttja during the early Holocene and mart during the middle Holocene; only minor fluctuations in hydrological conditions occurred, except for slightly warmer and drier conditions between 6.2 and 4.0 C-14 ka, These stable, shallow-water conditions may he due partly to persistent groundwater contributions to the site. Progressive encroachment of rooted aquatics led to present-day fen conditions; peat accumulation across the basin began by about 4.0 ka.																			0016-7606					JUN	2000	112	6					943	958		10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<943:PHAPOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<943:PHAPOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000087316900011

Following eruption, both maars slowly accumulated carbonaceous mud in freshwater lakes, until they were breached by rising sea level in the early Holocene (c. 8100 cal. yr at Onepoto, c. 7600 cal. yr at Pukaki). Following breaching, both became saltwater tidal lagoons with silled, subtidal basins rapidly accumulating marine mud as the underlying sediment compacted. Onepoto Lagoon may have had deeper water than Pukaki, because it was colonised by a foraminiferal fauna (Bolivina, Bulimina, Buliminella, Spiroloxostoma) that prefers quiet, dysoxic bottom conditions. Both fossil groups identify where the lagoons shallowed from subtidal to low tidal depths. This occurs c. 15 in downhole (6900 cal. yr) in Pukaki and c. 9.5 in downhole in Onepoto, after sea-level rise had levelled off at about its present height (7000 cal. yr). Marine mud sedimentation slowed in the intertidal, accumulating largely in response to 12 in and 5 in compaction of the maar fill, respectively. Subtidal and low tidal fringe foraminiferal faunas of both lagoons are characterised by Ammonia-Haynesina associations, whereas intertidal faunas above mean low water are dominated (>90%) by Ammonia. Pukaki Lagoon foraminiferal faunas differ from Onepoto by their higher subtidal diversity of benthic foraminiferal tests and the presence of planktic tests in the subtidal section. These differences are infer-red to relate to the significantly more exposed conditions outside the entrance to Manukau Harbour, where juvenile benthic tests were lifted into suspension and, together with the planktics, carried by the strong tidal currents up the harbour channels into Pukaki Lagoon. These introduced tests settled out of suspension in the quiet subtidal waters and accumulated in the sediment. Once Pukaki Lagoon had been filled with mud to intertidal depths, most introduced tests were apparently flushed away by the outgoing tides and did not accumulate. The presence in the Onepoto sequence (9.8-8.7 in) of the gastropods Micrelenchus huttonii and Notoacmea helmsi f. scapha indicate that Zostera seagrass once grew in the lagoon at around spring low tide level.

NESTS IN DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF A NORTH AFRICAN LAKE	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Long-term changes in wetland habitats have been lately reported all over the world. Global warming and, in particular, irrigation and eutrophication of shallow lakes cause changes in vegetation, often in directions differing from the natural ecological succession. As a result, from the viewpoint of waterbirds, their nesting habitats deteriorate, which leads to changes in their breeding biology and distribution. In this paper the nesting of Whiskered Tern Chlidonias hybrida (L.) was studied in changing habitat of Lake Tonga, the El-Kala National Park, NE Algeria in 1996 and 2005-2006. Since the 1960s, there has been a clear trend of extensive development of emergent and floating-leaved vegetation, with up to 80% of the lake surface being currently covered during summer. Nesting colonies of Whiskered Terns are mostly connected with beds of the white water-lily (Nymphaea alba L.). The average distance of breeding colonies from the shore line increased from 176 m in 1966 to 786 m in 2005 and 933 m in 2006. Over the study period, average nest size got twice smaller. Nest diameter was on the average 470 mm in 1996 and 236 mm in 2005-2006. The nests also changed shape and composition. The size and shape of nests were correlated with measures of their composition. Variables characterizing size, shape and composition of nests indeed differed in response to ecological variation of habitat between and within years. Our results suggest that the main function of Whiskered Tern nests is providing a firm support for eggs, incubating adults and young nestlings, which would correspond to the nest support hypothesis of Collias and Collias (1984). Nest size was influenced by ecological conditions in two ways: directly, by changing the availability of construction materials, and indirectly, by changing the distribution of colonies and, thus, physical conditions for nests. We also suggest that some components of the changes in nest size, shape and composition may be linked with the social and sexual signaling system of Whiskered Terns.

The transmitter weighed 1.3 g in air (0.9 g in water) and comprised, on average, 6% of the body weight of the fish (in air). Individuals were randomly assigned to an experimental group (control, surgical or gastric) and a sampling period (day 5 or day 21). Relative growth rate % as expressed as % body weight gained/day. General condition was assessed by necropsy. Physiological response variables included hematocrit, leucocrit and plasma protein concentration. The mean relative growth rates of control, surgical and gastric fish were not significantly different at day 5. By day 21, the gastric group had a significantly lower relative growth rate (1.3%) as compared to the surgical group (1.8%) and the control group (1.9%) (P = 0.0001). Mean hematocrit values were significantly lower in the surgical (41.8%) and gastric (42.2%) groups as compared to controls (47.3%) at day 5 (P = 0.01), but all were within normal range for salmonids. No significant differences in hematocrit values were detected at day 21. Leucocrit values for all groups were less than or equal to 1% in 99% of the fish. Both tagged groups had significantly lower mean plasma protein levels as compared to controls at day 5 (P = 0.001) and day 21 (P = 0.0001). At day 21 the gastric group (64.4 g 100 ml(-1)) had significantly lower mean plasma protein levels than the surgical group (68.8 g 100 ml(-1)) (P = 0.0001). Necropsies showed decreasing condition of gastrically tagged fish over time, and increasing condition of surgical fish. Paired releases of surgically and gastrically implanted yearling chinook salmon in the lower Columbia River in spring, 1996 revealed few significant differences in migration behavior through two reservoirs. We conclude that gastrically implanted fish show decreased growth and condition over a 21 d period. We recommend a surgical implantation method for long-term studies of juvenile salmonids, however, gastric implantation may be suitable for short-term studies.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	372						79	87		10.1023/A:1017019006039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017019006039													WOS:000076445100011
J	Jonasson, J				Jonasson, J			Selection experiments on Atlantic salmon ranching .2. Variation among release sites and strains for return rate, body weight and ratio of grilse to total return	AQUACULTURE												A Nordic project 'Salmon Ranching-Possibilities of Selective Breeding' started in Iceland in 1987. The aim of the project was to study the possibilities for breeding and selection in sea ranching of Atlantic salmon. Smelts from six salmon strains were released from four different release sites in three year-classes. Performance was estimated for return rate, body weight, ratio of grilse to total return and total biomass per 1000 smelts released, which gives a measure of total yield after 2 years at sea. In general, total return rate was low during the experiment, ranging from 3.04% to 0.96% between year-classes. The mean body weights of grilse and two-sea-winter salmon were 2.4 kg and 6.2 kg, respectively. Biomass per 1000 smelts released ranged from 35.6 kg to 87.5 kg between year-classes. Significant differences were observed among the salmon strains for all traits tested. In general, strains used for salmon ranching in Iceland gave the highest yield in total biomass compared with other strains tested; up to three-fold differences were observed. Return rates differed among release sites, with the highest return rates observed at the Kollafjordur release site, where smelts were released from a riverine trap, compared with releases directly from concrete tanks at Vogavik or from net pens at Silfurlax ranching stations. For the 1991 year-class, 94.0 kg total biomass returning was observed at the Kollafjordur release site compared with 52.7 kg at Vogavik and 75.3 kg at Silfurlax. Similar differences in return rates were observed between Kollafjordur and the Laros release site, where the smelts were released from netpens into a freshwater lake. Significant interactions between salmon strain and release site were detected for total return rate and the ratio of grilse to total return, but not for body weight of grilse.

T.			14C DATING OF ORGANIC RESIDUE AND CARBONATE FROM STROMATOLITES IN ETOSHA PAN, NAMIBIA: 14C RESERVOIR EFFECT, CORRECTION OF PUBLISHED AGES, AND EVIDENCE OF &gt;8-m-DEEP LAKE DURING THE LATE PLEISTOCENE	RADIOCARBON					21st International Radiocarbon Conference	2012	Paris, FRANCE					Lacustrine stromatolites are layered accretionary structures formed in shallow water by cyanobacteria. They are a precise indicator of high lake limits and their morphology and structure provide an insight into paleoenvironments of the time. Previous research on lacustrine stromatolites from Etosha Pan in Namibia based on radiocarbon ages of carbonates were close to the limit of the method and did not account for any possible C-14 reservoir effect. The ages were used to suggest that the basin was not extensively flooded during the last 40,000 yr. To assess the reservoir effect, the age characteristics of a stromatolite from Poacher's Point were investigated by C-14 dating both carbonate and organic residue from samples at different depths in the deposit. The similar to 15-cm-diameter stromatolite was separated into 12 zones from the center to the edge and block samples were cut from each zone; the carbonate and residual organic residue were dated separately. The carbonate ages ranged from 34,700 to 24,700 C-14 yr BP and the organic ages from 15,700 to 2500 C-14 yr BP. Ages generally increased with increasing distance from the surface of the deposit. We believe that the organic ages are an accurate estimate of the stromatolite's age, while the much older carbonate ages reflect incorporation of old carbon from limestone bedrock and ancient calcrete introduced by stream and spring flow. Excluding the 2 oldest organic ages (15,700 and 13,600 C-14 yr BP), which may reflect contamination by older organic material washed into the lake during flooding, a linear regression relationship between carbonate and organic ages indicates that the reservoir effect on carbonate ranges up to similar to 24,000 C-14 yr BP but decreases slightly as the true age of the deposit increases. This regression relationship was used to correct 2 finite carbonate ages for stromatolites from Pelican Island obtained in the early 1980s, which together with our new organic age for a stromatolite from Andoni Bay, document a > 8-m-deep lake in Etosha Pan during the Late Pleistocene, at and prior to similar to 34,000-26,000 cal yr BP. The organic carbon ages from the Poacher's Point stromatolite suggest prolonged lacustrine conditions during the early to middle Holocene (8000-6600 cal yr BP) but not to the extent seen during the Late Pleistocene.

J	BUATOIS, LA; MANGANO, G				BUATOIS, LA; MANGANO, G			LITHOFACIES AND DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES FROM A CARBONIFEROUS LAKE, SIERRA DE NARVAEZ, NORTHWEST ARGENTINA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Thick and widespread Late Carboniferous lacustrine successions occur in the Sierra de Narvaez area, northwest Argentina. A detailed lithofacies analysis forms the basis for the definition of fourteen lithofacies clustered into three assemblages. The delta assemblage consists of channelized cobble to pebble conglomerates, quartz-rich sandstones, and carbonaceous mudstones. This assemblage is present at the top of the lake succession and records the progradation of a short-headed stream delta. Wave- and current-rippled sandstones, and a heterolithic facies make up the shallow-lake assemblage. The nearshore area was probably composed of small bars, shoreline sand flats and low-energy sand-mud flats. The deep-lake assemblage is represented by two types of coarsening- and thickening-upward lithofacies sequences. The first type consists, from bottom to top, of laminated mudstones, thin-bedded turbidites, classic turbidites and massive sandstones. Each sequence is thought to represent turbidite lobe progradation in a basinal setting. The second type of sequence consists, from base to top, of underflow current sandstones and mudstones, thin-bedded and classic turbidites, deformed sandstones and hummocky cross-stratified sandstones. Each sequence records progradation of turbidite lobes on the delta front. The analyzed lithofacies record deposition in a hydrologically open lake. Final lake infill was related to the progradation of a deltaic system. It is suggested that four distinct processes controlled sediment transport and deposition in the Carboniferous lake: (1) delta progradation, (2) episodic sediment density surges, (3) river plume dispersion, and (4) wave action. During periods of high discharge, fine to very fine sand and silt bypassed mouth-bar zones and were deposited farther into the lake by underflow currents. Sands supplied by the delta system accumulated in the upper delta front in unstable conditions and were later redeposited by episodic turbidity currents. Wave action was able to rework shallow-water sands supplied by the delta system or emplaced by turbidity currents.																			0037-0738					OCT	1994	93	1-2					25	49		10.1016/0037-0738(94)90027-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(94)90027-2													WOS:A1994PM58600003

Here, we conducted additional palynological analyses to connect two separate radiocarbon-dated pollen sequences of Lago della Costa (AP2 and AP1) to one complete vegetation history record of the Euganean Hills ("Colli Euganei", northern Italy) covering the past ca. 32,000 years. Previous studies on autochthonous organic lake sediments revealed that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) Lago della Costa likely acted as a refugium of temperate woody taxa. Based on the new data we present the first continuous record of the vegetation history of the Euganean Hills during the past 32,000 years. Specifically, we investigate the early establishment and mass expansion of deciduous Quercus at the refugial site at ca. 16,800-16,600 cal bp. In the oak forests other temperate taxa (e.g. Corylus avellana, Abies alba, Ulmus, Fraxinus excelsior, Vitis, Hedera, Tilia, Acer, Fagus sylvatica) also established at around this time, i.e. 2,000 years prior to the onset of the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d interstadial (about 14,700-12,800 cal bp). The comparison of our data with other well-dated records from the river Po catchment and refugial sites elsewhere in Italy and southern Europe suggests expansions of boreal and nemoral forests over wide areas prior to the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d interstadial, i.e. 2,000 years before comparable large-scale afforestation north of the Alps or ca. 45 degrees N. Pollen-inferred expansions of temperate tree communities (e.g. oak forests) correspond to a climatic warming as reconstructed from quantitative, pollen-independent evidence (e.g. chironomids) from the Apennines, Northern Italy, Southern Switzerland and the Swiss Plateau, suggesting that pre-B & oslash;lling afforestation processes south of the Alps were promoted by increasing (summer) temperatures during the Oldest Dryas.

Several aspects have been studied and updated: the stages of progradation and retreat of the shoreline from the Middle Ages, with particular reference to the last 200 years, have been reconstructed and the natural and/or human forcing responsible for the area's evolution have been hypothesized. The processes that led to the formation and evolution of some small coastal lakes and the more recent evolution of the shoreline are defined. Monitoring of shoreline variations in the Ombrone Delta apex has been achieved by comparing aerial photos acquired in 1995, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2010. The progressive landward migration of the shoreline has resulted in a realignment of the coast. Comparison with older erosion and progradation rates shows decreasing erosion rates along the delta apex with time: the erosion rate of the northern wing has reached peaks of around 14 m/yr (2004-2006), and then fallen to 4.5 m/yr in the latest period (2006-2010). The Ombrone River delta is characterized by the presence of beach ridges, ponds and, in the past, of a coastal lake. Morpho-bathymetric analysis and comparison with historical maps shows that during the XIX century, the historical lake preserved its geometry; only in the 1883 map seaward side presents an irregular geometry, while in the 1929 map the ponds have been represented for the first time and are located seaward with respect to the XIX century beach ridge. Comparing morpho-bathymetric data of Chiaro Grande pond and submerged apical mouth, this study confirmed the hypothesis about Chiaro Grande pond genesis in which its formation is based on the closure of a narrow sea stretch consequent to the emergence of a bar. The independence between the genesis of ponds and lake evolution, highlighting the importance of mouth bar growth as a recurrent mechanism for confining narrow sea stretches. The orientation of morphological features and the prevailing wave climate suggest a sediment transport from south to north.

J	Moreno, PI; León, AL				Moreno, PI; León, AL			Abrupt vegetation changes during the last glacial to Holocene transition in mid-latitude South America	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A pollen record from the Huelmo site (ca. 41degrees30'S) shows that vegetation and climate changed at millennial time-scales during the last glacial to Holocene transition in the mid-latitude region of western South America. The record shows that a Nothofagus parkland dominated the landscape between 16400 and 14 600 C-14 yr BP, along with Magellanic Moorland and cupressaceous conifers. Evergreen North Patagonian rainforest taxa expanded in pulses at 14200 and 13000 C-14 yr BP, following a prominent rise in Nothofagus at 14600 C-14 yr BP. Highly diverse, closed canopy rainforests dominated the lowlands between 13000 and 12500 C-14 yr BP, followed by the expansion of cold-resistant podocarps and Nothofagus at ca. 12500 and 11500 C-14 yr BP. Local disturbance by fire favoured the expansion of shade-intolerant opportunistic taxa between 10900 and 10200 C-14 yr BP. Subsequent warming pulses at 10200 and 9100 C-14 yr BP led to the expansion of thermophilous, summer-drought resistant Valdivian rainforest trees until 6900 C-14 yr BP. Our results suggest that cold and hyperhumid conditions characterised the final phase of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 16400 and 14600 C-14 yr BP. The last ice age Termination commenced with a prominent warming event that led to a rapid expansion of North Patagonian trees and the abrupt withdrawal of Andean ice lobes from their LGM positon at ca. 147000 C-14 yr BP. Hyper-humid conditions prevailed between 16400 and 13000 C-14 yr BP, what we term the 'extreme glacial mode' of westerly activity. This condition was brought about by a northward shift and/or intensification of the southern westerlies. The warmest/driest conditions of the last glacial-interglacial transition occurred between 9100 and 6900 C-14 yr BP. During this period, the westerlies shifted to an 'extreme interglacial mode' of activity, via a poleward migration of stormtracks. Our results indicate that a highly variable climatic interval lasting 5500 C-14 years separate the opposite extremes of vegetation and climate during the last glacial-interglacial cycle, i.e. the end of the LGM and the onset of the early Holocene warm and dry period.

J	Okland, KA; Okland, J				Okland, KA; Okland, J			Freshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa) of Norway III:: distribution and ecology of Plumatella fruticosa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Bryozoans were investigated during field studies of 601 lakes and other surface water bodies throughout Norway from 1960 to 1978. The frequency of occurrence of Plumatella fruticosa was evaluated in relation to 12 environmental variables. Statistically significant deviations from the frequencies expected on the basis of random distribution were described using the categories preference, avoidance, and absence. According to our material P. fruticosa is one of the most common bryozoan species in Norwegian fresh water, represented in samples from 251 localities. This species occurred frequently all over the country, north to 71degrees 06' N (the northernmost record globally). Maximum elevation above sea level was 1179 m (maximum for Northern Europe). In most studies of freshwater bryozoans from the holarctic region, Plumatella fruticosa has been reported as widely distributed, but locally rare. In Norway, however, P. fruticosa is frequently found all over the country, even far to the north. The species apparently finds an optimal climate in the cold temperate and cold regions of Norway. Plumatella fruticosa preferred lakes, avoided slow-flowing rivers and ponds, and was absent in smaller water bodies. The species preferred somewhat higher elevation (400-900 m above sea level), but avoided lakes with the lowest summer temperatures (below 11 degreesC). P. fruticosa also preferred oligotrophic conditions with poor aquatic vegetation, stony shores, lakes poor in calcium and magnesium (sometimes almost comparable with distilled water), where the water was clear and colourless, and slightly acidic to neutral. The species also preferred lakes surrounded by Sphagnum bogs and was absent when pH was below 5.2. P. fruticosa avoided eutrophic conditions with rich aquatic vegetation, alkaline water (pH above 7.0), lakes with a higher content of calcium and magnesium and those with strongly coloured water (above 100 mg Pt l(-1)). In spite of its preference for ion-poor conditions, it was also found in a brackish water lake. For most environmental variables, the species had a wider tolerance range than reported from elsewhere.																			0018-8158					JUL	2002	479	1					11	22		10.1023/A:1021060027225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021060027225													WOS:000179168700002
J	Rea, RV				Rea, Roy V.			Impacts of Moose (Alces alces) Browsing on Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera) Morphology and Potential Timber Quality	SILVA FENNICA												Although moose browsing effects on the growth and morphology of birch are well studied, effects of moose browsing on potential timber quality of birch have received little attention. Here, an assessment was made of the impacts of moose (Alces alces L.) damage to Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) trees from a 20-year old clear cut area in a sub-boreal spruce forest within the Aleza Lake Research Forest, near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Specifically, differences in overall tree architecture and in the internal characteristics of trees that had been severely damaged and suppressed by moose winter browsing were compared to birch trees that had not been damaged by moose in this way and were considered free-to-grow. The average stem diameter, number of annular growth rings, and height of stem breaks made by moose on suppressed birches at the point of breakage was 17.9 +/- 6.6 mm, 4.6 +/- 1.2, and 141.8 +/- 32.0 cm, respectively. Stem diameters and the heights above-the-ground of stem breaks made by moose during sequential breakage events were not significantly different (all p >= 0.05) from one another. Decay was significantly (all p <= 0.001) more extensive in trees where branches had been broken off by moose than in trees with no breaks or where breaks were from unknown agents. Suppressed birches were significantly (p=0.048) more exposed (farther from their nearest tree neighbor) when compared to birches that were free-to-grow. The distance from birch trees to species-specific neighbors (of any species) did not differ (all p >= 0.05) between suppressed and free-to-grow birches. Suppressed birches damaged from intense browsing and stem breakage were significantly (p <= 0.001) farther away from other birches showing signs of slight to moderate browsing than free-to-grow birches were from similar conspecifics. Because moose appear to impact the potential wood quality of birch, forest managers should consider the impacts that browsing and stem breakage can have on birch timber where these trees co-occur with and are eaten by moose.																			0037-5330	2242-4075					2011	45	2					227	236	114	10.14214/sf.114	http://dx.doi.org/10.14214/sf.114													WOS:000292585400005

Geological and environmental implications of the evaporite karst in Spain	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY					Meeting on Evaporite Karst held at the 6th International Conference on Geomorphology	SEP, 2005	Zaragoza, SPAIN	Spanish Soc Geomorphol, Int Assoc Geomorphologists				In Spain, evaporite outcrops cover approximately 7% of the total area of the country. Most of the evaporitic formations are made up of Ca-sulfates (gypsum/anhydrite) or Ca-sulfates and halite. Certain Paleogene marine evaporites also contain K-Mg-chlorides, and some Tertiary continental formations bear substantial amounts of Na-sulfates in the subsurface (glauberite and thenardite). Mesozoic evaporitic formations commonly wedge out towards the ground surface, passing into condensed sequences and dissolution-collapse breccias. Some of these highly porous breccias constitute major regional aquifers. In several areas, interstratal karstification of the evaporites has given rise to gravitational deformations such as basin structures, monoclines, and collapse structures covering several square kilometers that record a cumulative subsidence in excess of 200 m (Teruel and Calatayud Grabens). A widespread consequence of evaporite dissolution processes in Spain is the hydrochemical degradation of surface waters. Some of the largest and most outstanding lake systems, from an environmental perspective, occur in karstic depressions developed in evaporitic formations (Fuente de Piedra, Gallocanta, Bujaraloz, and Baiolas lakes). Sinkhole activity is a major geohazard in several evaporite karst areas. The sinkhole risk has a particularly high impact in sectors where Tertiary evaporites are overlain by Quaternary alluvial aquifers (Calatayud, Zaragoza, and Madrid areas). Some of the detrimental effects of subsidence include severe damage to historical monuments (Calatayud), the demolition of a whole village (Puilatos), or the derailment of a freight train (Zaragoza area). The deepest gypsum caves are found in Triassic diapiric structures (El Sumidor Cave, 210 m deep), and the longest ones are developed in horizontally lying Neogene sequences (Sorbas caves, and Estremera maze cave). The Cardona diapir hosts salt caves up to 4,300 m long whose genesis is related to flooding of mine galleries caused by the interception of a phreatic conduit. The main anthropogenic impacts on the endokarstic systems are related to the disposal of wastewaters and the destruction of caves by quarrying. The fluvial valleys that cross Tertiary evaporitic outcrops commonly show peculiar geological characteristics related to dissolution-induced synsedimentary subsidence phenomena: (1) Thickened alluvium filling dissolution basins up to several tens of kilometers long and more than 100 m deep. The largest thickenings are found in areas where the bedrock contains halite and glauberite. (2) Superimposed alluvial units locally bounded by angular unconformities. (3) Abundant deformational structures and paleosinkholes related to the rockhead and/or interstratal karstification of the substratum. These fluvial valleys typically are flanked by a prominent gypsum escarpment. Rock-falls favored by the dissolutional enlargement of joints derived from these scarps are the type of mass movement which has caused the highest number of casualties in Spain.

It is a single composite body at depth with derivative branches extending higher into the crust, and consists of three phases: monzodiorite, syenite/quartz monzonite and granite, emplaced at approximately 2.671 Ga, 2.663-2.669 Ga and 2.670 Ga, respectively. The metaluminous monzodiorites with abundant angular igneous mafic xenoliths, enriched zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from - 0.52 to + 4.20 and enriched epsilon(Nd)(t) ( - 0.37 to + 1.74), were generated by assimilation fractional crystallization of a mafic magma generated by partial melting of enriched mantle metasomatized by melts of subducted oceanic sediments. The metaluminous syenite/quartz monzonite phase has similar mineral assemblages, trace element and Nd-Hf isotopic characteristics to the monzodiorite, and was probably produced by assimilation fractional crystallization of a monzodiorite magma. The granite-hosted zircons have prominent positive Ce anomalies, negative Eu anomalies and mostly positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) (- 0.12 to + 4.25) and enriched epsilon(Nd)(t) values ( -1.70 to +0.71), suggesting a mixed source of immature sedimentary rocks and metasomatically enriched mantle-derived magma. The subduction of oceanic lithosphere under the Abitibi-Wawa arc during the collision of the Abitibi-Wawa arc and the Wabigoon terrane before similar to 2.7 Ga, generated a metasomatically enriched mantle and associated volcanic rocks. The volcanic rocks underwent rapid weathering and erosion to form the immature sedimentary rocks of the Quetico accretionary prism. Lithospheric inversion caused partial melting of the metasomatically enriched mantle, generating a mafic magma. The mafic magma ascended and underwent assimilation fractional crystallization forming the monzodiorite and syenite/quartz monzonite. Mafic magma was emplaced at the base of the Archean immature sedimentary rocks, triggering melting to generate felsic magma. Mixing of these felsic and mafic magmas generated the DLGC granite in the shallow crust. The Neoarchean arc-continent collision preserved in the Quetico Basin is similar to that in modern arc systems where intra-oceanic arc crust is added to continental margins, suggesting it was an important mechanism for recycling juvenile crust, generating compositional differentiation, and cratonization.

Retrospective analysis of Trumpeter Swan Cygnus buccinator decline in Yellowstone National Park, USA	WILDFOWL												The Trumpeter Swans Cygnus buccinator that nest and winter in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) played an important role in the survival of the species when unregulated shooting and habitat loss threatened them with extirpation. While conservation measures saved the Trumpeter Swan, and their numbers have increased greatly across North America, the abundance and productivity of YNP's resident Trumpeter Swans declined from about 1960 until 2010, when captive-bred releases began to supplement their numbers. Many hypotheses for the initial decline in YNP Trumpeter Swans exist, including human disturbance at nesting areas, changes in habitat quality, predation and lower Trumpeter Swan abundance in the broader geographic region reducing the immigration of swans into YNP. This study used long-term historical Trumpeter Swan monitoring data and existing covariate data to explore competing hypotheses about possible factors associated with temporal and spatial variation in swan abundance and reproductive success in YNP during 1931- 2011. Bayesian reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods were used to evaluate whether covariates representing swan decline hypotheses explained variation in annual, wetland-level patterns of where swans were absent (Absent), present but without fledged young (Present), and bred successfully with fledged young (Successful) each year. Model covariates that explained variation in wetland status supported several of the hypotheses for Trumpeter Swan decline. Wetlands within YNP were more likely to have Trumpeter Swans Present as opposed to Absent during 1931-1959 in years when the total abundance of Trumpeter Swans in the broader geographic area around YNP was greater. During 1960-2011, wetlands within YNP were more likely to have Trumpeter Swans Present as opposed to Absent when estimated Grizzly Bear Ursus arctos abundance was lower and when YNP recorded fewer annual visitors, although these covariates correlated strongly with time, making it difficult to distinguish between the underlying causes of temporal trends and preventing stronger inferences from being made. The lakes, rivers and wetlands identified quantitatively in this study as being the most likely to have swans Present and/or Successful can be a useful tool to help YNP staff manage important swan habitat or justify future management actions.																			0954-6324	2052-6458					2024					7		89	114																WOS:001445333100005

In this study we examine tree rings of five well-preserved Pinus sylvestris (Scots pines) that grew in the area in front of the retreating ice sheet in northern Sweden. They became buried in flood sediments deposited by a glacial outburst flood (j & ouml;kulhlaup) about 9.5-9.9 kyr cal bp and the aim of our study was to search for information regarding damage from fires and bioclimatic conditions in their ancient tree ring records. Our analysis, providing a glimpse into the local early Holocene environment in north-central Sweden, suggests that: 1, there were repeated fires (four fire events detected) during the early Holocene; and 2, bioclimatic conditions when the ancient pines were growing resembled those of modern sub-alpine pine woods. The latter is indicated by their patterns of tree ring growth (growth rate and variation), which were statistically similar to those of pines growing in sub-alpine woods with an open canopy, but different from pines in protected and managed boreal forests. Lower delta C-13 for the ancient latewood in comparison to pine wood from trees growing near the Scandinavian mountains before the 1850s were probably caused both by stomata fractionation due to lower atmospheric CO2 during the early Holocene and by the moist local environment created by the nearby ancient Ancylus lake, which preceded the Baltic Sea. Periods with cloudy and cold summers were also indicated by the occurrence of 'false rings'. Finds of charred fragments of Calluna vulgaris (heather, ling), an understory shrub that can burn even with a relatively high moisture content, suggest that heath vegetation was crucial to make fire a reoccurring ecological factor in the area during the early Holocene.

An information theoretic Bayesian uncertainty analysis of AEM systems over Menindee Lake, Australia	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Long-range, active-source airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems for near-surface conductivity imaging fall into two categories: helicopter (rotary-wing) borne or fixed-wing aircraft borne. A multitude of factors such as flying height, transmitter loop area and current, source waveforms, aerodynamic stability and data stacking times contribute to the geological resolvability of the subsurface. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of each system considering all such factors is difficult, but test flights over well-constrained subsurface geology with downhole induction logs are extremely useful for resolution studies. However, given the non-linear nature of the electromagnetic inverse problem, handling transmitter-receiver geometries in fixed-wing aircraft is especially challenging. As a consequence of this non-linearity, inspecting the closeness of downhole conductivities to deterministic inversion results is not sufficient for studying resolvability. A more comprehensive picture is provided by examining the variation in probability mass of the depth-wise Bayesian posterior conductivity distributions for each kind of AEM system within an information theoretic framework. For this purpose, probabilistic inversions of data must be carried out. Each acquiring system should fly over the same geology, survey noise levels must be measured and the same prior probabilities on conductivity must be used. With both synthetic models as well as real data from over the Menindee calibration range in New South Wales, Australia, we shed new light on the matter of AEM inverse model uncertainty. We do this using two information theoretic attributes derived from different Kullback-Leibler divergences-Bayesian information gain, and a strictly proper scoring rule, to assess posterior probabilities estimated by a novel Bayesian inversion scheme. The inversion marginalizes fixed-wing geometry attributes as generic nuisance parameters during Markov chain sampling. This is the first time-domain AEM study we know of, that compares nuisance marginalized subsurface posterior conductivities from a fixed-wing system, with rotary-wing derived posterior conductivities. We also compare field results with induction log data where available. Finally, we estimate the information gain in each case via a covariate shift adaptation technique that has not been used before in geophysical work. Our findings have useful implications in AEM system selection, as well as in the design of better deterministic AEM inversion algorithms.					; ley-cooper, Alan/D-1567-2012; Moghaddam, Negin/IRZ-0513-2023	Ray, Anandaroop/0000-0002-6113-6900; Fouladi Moghaddam, Negin/0000-0002-1099-7030; 													0956-540X	1365-246X				JUL 27	2023	235	2					1888	1911		10.1093/gji/ggad337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad337		SEP 2023											WOS:001064357400003
J	Zhong, YZ; Willett, SD; Picotti, V				Zhong, Yuezhi; Willett, Sean D.; Picotti, Vincenzo			Climate oscillations and erosional processes in the Ordos tectonic block and implications for sediment supply to the Yellow River	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Climate variations in both space and time can impact mountain topography and drainage-basin morphology through a variety of surface processes. This is illustrated dramatically in the Ordos Block of northern China, which encompasses the main body of the Loess Plateau in the southeast and the Mu Us Desert in the northwest. The plateau is known for severe soil erosion by fluvial processes; whereas the desert is dominated by aeolian processes. Here we characterize the spatial transition in landscape relief and drainage network integration of the middle Ordos Block, corresponding to a precipitation gradient across the region, that is otherwise homogeneous in terms of its tectonics and bedrock. Differences in landscape relief and drainage network integration occur over a short range in precipitation rate, and outside this transition zone, landscape morphologic metrics appear to be relatively insensitive to precipitation. Where precipitation rates are greater than -420 mm/yr, landscapes are characterized by integrated drainage networks with relief over 100 m within a 1 km radius. With precipitation rates lower than -380 mm/yr, the landscapes tend to have lower relief, discontinuous channels and hundreds of playa lakes indicating inefficient runoff. Combined with stratigraphic records, we posit that continuous drainage networks in the semi-arid to arid transition zone expand in wetter periods, and shrink and fragment when precipitation falls below a threshold. Today the Ordos Block is experiencing the transition from a drier (glacial) stage to a wetter (interglacial) stage, with higher precipitation rates over the past -12 thousand years. It follows that fluvial processes likely have increased in efficiency and are currently advancing into regions to the northwest formerly dominated by aeolian processes. Our findings suggest that a component of the severe sediment erosion of the Loess Plateau is a transient feature locally associated with glacial-interglacial climate change and the transition from aeolian- to fluvial-dominated surface processes.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

J	Pekkarinen, M; Suoranta, R				Pekkarinen, M; Suoranta, R			Effects of transportation stress and recovery and sample treatment on Ca2+ and glucose concentrations in body fluids of Anodonta anatina (Linnaeus)	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Removal of lake mussels from a river and 15-20 minutes storage in river water in a bucket caused Ca2+ concentrations in the haemolymph and extrapallial fluid to increase significantly. Further storage and transport of mussels in a small quantity of river water to the laboratory increased the haemolymph and extrapallial fluid calcium concentrations, which were equal to each other and normally about 4.5-6 mmol L(-1) in summer, to nearly double, about 8-12 mmol L(-1). In mussels maintained in the laboratory at 4 degrees C for 2 weeks or 2 months, the elevated calcium concentrations decreased but often remained at about 6-8.5 mmol L(-1). If mussels were returned to the river, the calcium concentrations were normalized. In the mantle cavity fluid, Ca2+ concentration (which normally was around 4 mmol L(-1)) rose more slowly, but could reach that of the haemolymph after a transportation stress. During and after the transport of mussels, calcium leakage to the surrounding water was apparent (post-transport leakage of 0.07 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) was measured over one week). Glucose concentrations in mussel fluids showed a clear stress reaction when mussels were transferred to the laboratory. Haemolymph and extrapallial fluid glucose concentrations, which normally were very low (50-140 mu mol L(-1)) rose about 5-7-fold, and that of mantle cavity fluid rose about 5-fold. In the laboratory, the elevated glucose concentrations decreased but tended to remain above normal. In a mussel group which had experienced additional stress, haemolymph and extrapallial fluid glucose concentrations remained at the 3-fold elevated level, 300-320 mu mol L(-1), for at least 2 weeks. Storage of mussel fluid samples in a freezer significantly decreased measurable Ca2+ concentrations due to precipitate formation. Measurable glucose concentrations tended to increase (but not significantly) during as short a time as a few hours storage, particularly when no perchloric acid was added.																			0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	1995	14	2					425	433																WOS:A1995TT36500021

Few studies, however, have examined the associations between Great Lakes Basin fish consumption and PFAS exposure. Many licensed anglers and Burmese refugees and immigrants residing in western New York State consume fish caught from the Great Lakes and surrounding waters, raising their risk of exposure to environ-mental contaminants including PFAS. The aims of this study were to: 1) present the PFAS exposure profile of the licensed anglers and Burmese refugees and 2) examine the associations between serum PFAS levels and local fish consumption.& nbsp;Methods: Licensed anglers (n = 397) and Burmese participants (n = 199) provided blood samples and completed a detailed questionnaire in 2013. We measured 12 PFAS in serum. Multiple linear regression was used to assess associations between serum PFAS concentrations and self-reported consumption of fish from Great Lakes waters.& nbsp;Results: Licensed anglers and Burmese participants reported consuming a median of 16 (IQR: 6-36) and 88 (IQR: 44-132) meals of locally caught fish in the year before sample collection, respectively (data for Burmese group restricted to 10 months of the year). Five PFAS were detected in almost all study participants (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA and PFDA; 97.5-100%). PFOS had the highest median serum concentration in licensed anglers (11.6 ng/mL) and the Burmese (35.6 ng/mL), approximately two and six times that of the U.S. general popu-lation, respectively. Serum levels of other PFAS in both groups were generally low and comparable to those in the general U.S. population. Among licensed anglers, Great Lakes Basin fish meals over the past year were positively associated with serum PFOS (P < 0.0001), PFDA (P < 0.0001), PFHxS (P = 0.01), and PFNA (P = 0.02) and the number of years consuming locally caught fish was positively associated with serum PFOS (P = 0.01) and PFDA (P = 0.01) levels. In the Burmese group, consuming Great Lakes Basin fish more than three times a week in the past summer was positively associated with serum PFOS (P = 0.004) and PFDA (P = 0.02) among the Burmese of non-Karen ethnicity, but not among those of Karen ethnicity, suggesting potential ethnic differences in PFAS exposure.& nbsp;Conclusions: Great Lakes Basin fish consumption was associated with an increase in blood concentrations of some PFAS, and especially of PFOS, among licensed anglers and Burmese refugees and immigrants in western New York State. In the Burmese population, there may be other important PFAS exposure routes related to residential history and ethnicity. Continued outreach efforts to increase fish advisory awareness and reduce exposure to contaminants are needed among these populations.					; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/A-3966-2013	Lewis-Michl, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5814-7545; Nordstrom, Monica/0000-0002-0462-0413; Wattigney, Wendy/0000-0001-8457-4586													1438-4639	1618-131X				MAR	2022	240								113902	10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113902								34915281					WOS:000791299400014

Solid Precipitation and Visibility Measurements at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments in Southern Ontario and Bratt's Lake in Southern Saskatchewan	REMOTE SENSING												Accurate measurement of solid precipitation (S) has a critical importance for proper understanding of the Earth's hydrological cycle, validation of emerging technologies and weather prediction models, and developing parameterizations of severe weather elements such as visibility (Vis). However, measuring S is still a challenging problem, due mainly to wind effects. The wind effects are normally mitigated by using a Double-Fence Automated Reference (DFAR) system to reduce the wind speed (U-g). To contribute towards addressing some of these problems, we have analyzed datasets collected at two sites, Center for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) and Bratt's Lake, located in southern Ontario and southern Saskatchewan, Canada, respectively, using several instruments. The instruments at CARE include two Geonor gauges, one placed inside a DFAR (S-DFAR) and the other inside a double Alter shield (DAS(G)), a Pluvio2 gauge inside a single Alter shield (SAS(P)), a HotPlate, a PARSIVEL2 disdrometer that measures S and fall velocity (V), and an FD12P senor that measures S and type and Vis. The instruments deployed in Bratt's Lake includes a similar DFAR system and DAS Pluvio2 gauge. The results show that for the U-g observed in this study (U-g < 6 ms(-1)), both DAS(G) and SAS(P) have similar collection efficiency (CE) of near 70%. The transfer functions (TF) for DAS(G) and SAS(P) as a function of U-g and also U-g, and V were derived. The TF developed for the DAS(G) that includes both U-g and V showed better agreement with observation than just U-g alone. The TF developed for DAS(G) at CARE site was tested using the data collected in Bratt's Lake and correlated well (R = 0.86), but slightly overestimated the S accumulation by about 12%. The S measured at CARE site using all the other instruments were correlated well with SDFAR (R = 0.9), but the PARSIVEL2 and FD12P overestimated and underestimated the snow amount, respectively, as compared the S-DFAR. However, the HotPlate captured similar amount of S as the S-DFAR. According to this study, the SDFAR showed good correlation with Vis.						bouadala, faisal/0000-0002-1943-3928														2072-4292				AUG	2023	15	16							4079	10.3390/rs15164079	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15164079													WOS:001056078200001

Environmental changes at final warming of Middle Pleistocene (MIS 7) in South Kurils	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Entirely new data have been obtained on the South Kuril environments at the time of the Middle Pleistocene warming. These data are correlatable with MIS 7. The data show climatic rhythms, and shed new light on paleo-oceanologic conditions and the evolution of environments at that time. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions are based on multidisciplinary studies of the marine deposit sequence exposed in a sea cliff in the eastern part of Tanfiliev Island, including a buried oyster reef. In the course of the studies, analyses of mollusc fauna, diatoms, and pollen were performed. Benthic foraminifera were first found in the Middle Pleistocene sediments of the South Kurils. The sediments were dated using the Th-230/U method, and by the presence of the zonal diatom species Thalassiosira nidulus. The warming process was not unidirectional: two warmer intervals were separated by a slight cooling. A complicated process of climatic fluctuation is reflected in the succession of diatom assemblages, the latter also being influenced by the warm current and the solar heating of coastal water. In the first stage of warming, there existed an oyster reef composed of densely packed shells of Crassostrea gigas. Nineteen associated species were found, 11 percent of them extra-limital warm water species. The presence of these species suggests the summer surface sea water temperature was 6 degrees C - 8 degrees C above that of today, on the Tanfiliev coast, at the time of the reef growth. The warming coincided with marine transgression: the latter was once interrupted with a limited regression which coincided with a short period of cooling. The sequence of deposition environments is reconstructed as follows: a shallow bay - a coastal lake - an open bay. The adjacent land was covered with cool-temperate broadleaf and coniferous-broadleaf forests, the coniferous species gaining in importance during cooling. During the second warm phase, the proportion of coniferous and small-leaved species in plant communities was drastically reduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Mapping Dissolved Organic Carbon and Organic Iron by Comparing Deep Learning and Linear Regression Techniques Using Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 Imagery (Byers Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica)	REMOTE SENSING												Byers Peninsula is considered one of the largest ice-free areas in maritime Antarctica. Since 2006, the Spanish Polar Program has taken part in a large number of environmental studies involving the effects of climate change on biological life cycles, limnology, and microbiology. Soils from maritime Antarctica are generally weakly developed and have chemical, physical, and morphological characteristics that are strongly influenced by the parent material. However, biological activity during the short Antarctic summer promotes intense transference of nutrients and organic matter in areas occupied by different species of birds and marine mammals. Mapping and monitoring those areas that are highly occupied by various species could be very useful to create models prepared from satellite images of the edaphic properties. In this approach, deep learning and linear regression models of the soil properties and spectral indexes, which were considered as explicative variables, were used. We trained the models on soil properties closely related to biological activity such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the iron fraction associated with the organic matter (Fe). We tested the best approach to model the spatial distribution of DOC, Fe, and pH by training the linear regression and deep learning models on Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 images. The most robust models, the pH model built with the deep learning approach on Sentinel images (MAE of 0.51, RMSE of 0.70, and R2 with a residual of -0.49), the DOC model built with linear regression on Sentinel images (MAE of 189.39, RMSE of 342.23, and R2 with a residual of 0.0), and the organic Fe model built with deep learning (MAE of 116.20, RMSE of 209.93, and R2 of -0.05), were used to track possible areas with ornithogenic soils, as well as areas of Byers Peninsula that could be supporting the highest biological development.

There is need for updated information on the extent of disease burden, communities at risk and factors associated with infection at the district and sub-district level to facilitate effective prioritization and monitoring while ensuring ownership and sustainability of prevention and control programs at the local level. Methods and Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study between May and July 2006 among pupils in Blantyre district from a stratified random sample of 23 primary schools. Information on socio-demographic factors, schistosomiasis symptoms and other risk factors was obtained using questionnaires. Urine samples were examined for Schistosoma hematobium ova using filtration method. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions with robust estimates were used to assess risk factors for S. hematobium. One thousand one hundred and fifty (1,150) pupils were enrolled with a mean age of 10.5 years and 51.5% of them were boys. One thousand one hundred and thirty-nine (1,139) pupils submitted urine and S. hematobium ova were detected in 10.4% (95%CI 5.43-15.41%). Male gender (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.06-3.07), child's knowledge of an existing open water source (includes river, dam, springs, lake, etc.) in the area (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.14-3.46), history of urinary schistosomiasis in the past month (OR 3.65; 95% CI 2.22-6.00), distance of less than 1 km from school to the nearest open water source (OR 5.39; 95% CI 1.67-17.42) and age 8-10 years (OR 4.55; 95% CI 1.53-13.50) compared to those 14 years or older were associated with infection. Using urine microscopy as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of self-reported hematuria was 68.3% and 73.6%, respectively. However, the positive predictive value was low at 23.9% and was associated with age. Conclusion: The study provides an important update on the status of infection in this part of sub-Saharan Africa and exemplifies the success of deliberate national efforts to advance active participation in schistosomiasis prevention and control activities at the sub-national or sub-district levels. In this population, children who attend schools close to open water sources are at an increased risk of infection and self-reported hematuria may still be useful in older children in this region.

Airborne laser swath mapping of the summit of Erebus volcano, Antarctica: Applications to geological mapping of a volcano	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The lidar observations reported here have provided the first high precision topographic data on the active craters of Erebus volcano, Antarctica. Digital elevation data are invaluable for geomorphic analysis of volcanoes especially when combined with methods to automatically extract landscape features. The data are indispensable for studying eruptive events and volcano-tectonic processes. Airborne laser scanning or lidar is a rapidly emerging technology to map surface topography with high accuracy and detail, comparable to a 1:1000 scale map. In the austral summer of 2001-2002 airborne laser scanning data were collected in Antarctica over the summit plateau of Erebus volcano. We describe the high-resolution data set from Erebus, products derived from the data and demonstrate how extracted topographic features can be used in the geomorphic analysis of volcanoes. Background is presented on the airborne laser scanning method and on the accuracy estimation of laser points. We describe the computation of a high-resolution DEM with a grid size of 2 m x 2 m for the summit area of Erebus volcano. Errors in the DEM are assessed using independent ground-based GPS data and the RMS error is estimated to be 039 m. Visualization methods reveal topographic features that are very useful for geomorphic analysis. Automatic feature extraction and processing is necessary to exploit the high-resolution and accurate elevation data. Methods are described to extract 1D and 2D features and organize them for subsequent analysis. Fitting analytical functions to 3D point clouds or DEMs is particularly effective in extracting topographic features, including planes, higher order surfaces, cones, and conic sections. These methods are used to obtain a quantitative description of the calderas and modem-day crater of Erebus. Especially valuable are the measured surface areas if the lava lakes as these control thermal emissions and gas fluxes from the volcano. Examination of the surface elevations of Ray Lava Lake, Werner Vent and Active Vent indicates that the active vents were more or less in magmastatic equilibrium in 2001 December. Conic segments are fitted to mapped sections of caldera rims to identify the sections buried under younger lava flows or covered by ice and snow. Automatic methods are used to detect and characterize lava channels using geomorphometric maps generated from the DEM. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since the 13th cycle of the Five Year Plan, with the continuous improvement in the exploration level of the Taizhou Formation (K2t), the difficulty of tapping potential has gradually increased. It is urgent to change our thinking and expand new exploration layers. From the perspective of oil and gas display frequency in different layers of the Haian Depression, except for K2t, the oil and gas systems with the Fusan Member (E1f3) as the main reservoir have good oil and gas display frequency, demonstrating great exploration potential. This study of sedimentary characteristics is the basis of analyzing the sedimentary environment and lithofacies paleogeographic conditions and is of great significance for determining the distribution range of subtle oil and gas reservoirs. Based on this understanding, this study was specially established to systematically analyze the logging curves of forty-three wells in the research area, combined with core observations of eighteen coring wells and the analysis of eight seismic profiles. The results show that the low slope, warm and humid climate, sufficient provenance, and frequent lake level rise and fall cycles during the deposition period of the E1f3 member of the Haian Sag provide a favorable depositional background for the development of shallow water delta in the study area. There are many gullies in the research area, mainly consisting of U-shaped gullies and W-shaped gullies. Slope breaks are mainly affected by structural factors leading to fractures, and the types are mostly fault terrbreakslope breaks. In the study area, the shallow water delta deposits during the deposition period of the four key sand groups in the Fu3 Formation are dominated by the shallow water delta front and shallow water prodelta. The shallow water delta plain subfacies are not significantly developed because of erosion. The sand bodies are mainly distributed in the Sunjiawa Subdepression, and the Fuan Subdepression in the north of the depression, and the sand bodies in the plane show the filling characteristics of the strip. Based on the above research, a sedimentary model of shallow water delta during the E1f3 section of the Haian Depression was established, providing a geological basis for the design of exploration and development plans for hidden oil and gas reservoirs in the next step.																				2075-163X				JAN	2025	15	1							75	10.3390/min15010075	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min15010075													WOS:001404447700001

U-Pb zircon dates for the two rock types indicate coeval crystallization at 1112 +/- 4 Ma. A concordant 1106 +/- 3 Ma titanite date from the granophyre overlaps the crystallization age, implying rapid cooling, and is consistent with field and petrographic evidence of no subsequent penetrative deformation, metamorphism, or hydrothermal disturbance. The mean direction of magnetization of the rhyolite at Littlewood Nunataks is statistically indistinguishable from the mean directions of five sites in the granophyre and crosscutting rhyolite dikes at Bertrab Nunataks. The group mean virtual geomagnetic pole of 22.9 degrees N, 80.3 degrees E (N=6, A(95)=6.8 degrees) compares favorably with the only other extant Precambrian paleomagnetic poles for the East Antarctic craton, two poles from western Dronning Maud Land. The East Antarctic and Laurentian poles of 1.1 Ga do not coincide after restoration of the continents to a position suggested by the SWEAT hypothesis juxtaposing the Pacific margins of East Antarctica-Australia and Laurentia, indicating either that the hypothesis is incorrect or that Coats Land and parts of western Dronning Maud Land (herein the CMG province) were not part of the East Antarctic craton at 1.1 Ga. In support of the latter, there is reasonable agreement of the 1.1 Ga CMG poles and approximately coeval poles from the Kalahari craton of West Gondwana when the CMG is restored to a position adjacent the Kalahari craton. Such a reconstruction places the CMG in West Gondwana rather than East Gondwana, as originally implied in Rodinia reconstructions, and is consistent with previously recognized links between the geology of the Kalahari craton and western Dronning Maud Land. It further implies that the CMG did not become part of East Antarctica until latest Precambrian to Cambrian time. A new reconstruction places a partially assembled West Gondwana off the present southeastern margin of Laurentia at 1.1 Ga such that poles of the CMG and Kalahari fall on the Laurentian polar wander path for this time period.

Morphometric study of lake basins from the Indian subcontinent: A critical review	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Lakes from the Indian subcontinent are ecosystems of vital importance as they contain high levels of biodiversity which is threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures and the impacts of ongoing global warming. The present review article examines the morphometric features of 35 lakes from the Indian subcontinent and explores the links between lake morphometry, sediment distribution in the lake bottom, and degradation of the lake ecosystem. For this purpose, a series of lake morphometric parameters such as Schindler's ratio (SR), dynamic ratio (DR), relative depth (RD), shoreline development index (SDI) and energy factor (EF) were calculated. In addition, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on morphometric parameters, which identified (i) lake size and (ii) water depth as the key parameters that influence sediment distribution at the lake bottom. Our findings also implied that the lakes with higher SR values (e.g., Shilloi, Anchar, Pulicat, and Tso Kar Lakes) are prone to water quality degradation due to inputs from much larger catchments as compared to their lake water volume. However, a detailed understanding of modern lake processes (such as water mixing and evaporation) is required to decipher the link between the degradation status of the lake and the cumulative response of both the lake and catchment processes. Furthermore, the high fetch length and DR for relatively shallow lakes such as Chilika, Kolleru, Loktak, and Pulicat suggest that the sediment distribution is more likely to be affected by wind-induced mixing effects, whereas in deeper lakes (e.g., Tso Moriri, Phoksundo, Rara), the role of wave action is minimal. Conversely, in the small-shallow lakes, the role of peripheral wave activity is the dominant phenomenon that controls the sediment resuspension and redistribution within the basin. Further, the majority of the studied lakes show high SDI values (>1.5) suggesting irregular shorelines, which favours the development of complex littoral habitats, either due to anthropogenic activity or increased sediment supply from the surface runoff. This parameter also highlighted the importance of an effective sampling design that reflects the spatial variability of sediment behaviour in various parts of the lake. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the Indian subcontinent to utilise morphometric indices for understanding the lake's degradation status and the role of excessive anthropogenic activity in influencing shoreline habitats.

J	Brandon, AD; Humayun, M; Puchtel, IS; Zolensky, ME				Brandon, AD; Humayun, M; Puchtel, IS; Zolensky, ME			Re-Os isotopic systematics and platinum group element composition of the Tagish Lake carbonaceous chondrite	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The Tagish Lake meteorite is a primitive C2 chondrite that has undergone aqueous alteration shortly after formation of its parent body. Previous work indicates that if this type of material was part of a late veneer during terrestrial planetary accretion, it could provide a link between atmophile elements such as H, C, N and noble gases, and highly siderophile element replenishment in the bulk silicate portions of terrestrial planets following core formation. The systematic Re-Os isotope and highly siderophile element measurements performed here on five separate fractions indicate that while Tagish Lake has amongst the highest Ru/Ir (1.63 +/- 0.08), Pd/Ir (1.19 +/- 0.06) and Os-187/Os-188 (0.12564-0.12802) of all carbonaceous chondrites, these characteristics still fall short of those necessary to explain the observed siderophile element systematics of the primitive upper mantles of Earth and Mars. Hence, a direct link between atmophile and highly siderophile elements remains elusive, and other sources for replenishment are required, unless an as yet poorly constrained process fractionated Re/Os, Ru/Ir, and Pd/Ir following late accretion on both the Earth and Mars mantles. The unique elevated Ru/Ir combined with elevated Os-187/Os-188 of Tagish Lake may be attributed to Ru and Re mobility during aqueous alteration very early in its parent body history. The Os, Ir, Pt, and Pd abundances of Tagish Lake are similar to Cl chondrites. The elevated Ru/Ir and the higher Re/Os and consequent Os-187/Os-188 in Tagish Lake, are balanced by a lower Ru/Ir and lower Re/Os and Os-187/Os-188 in CM-chondrites, relative to Cl chondrites. A model that links Tagish Lake with CI and CM chondrites in the same parent body may explain the observed systematics. In this scenario, CM chondrite material comprises the exterior, grading downward to Tagish Lake material, which grades to Cl material in the interior of the parent body. Aqueous alteration intensifies towards the interior with increasing temperature. Ruthenium and Re are mobilized from the CM layer into the Tagish Lake layer. This model may thus provide a potential direct parent body relationship between three separate groups of carbonaceous chondrites. Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Mid-Holocene drought and lake-level change at Elk Lake, Clearwater County, Minnesota: Evidence from CHIRP seismic-reflection data	HOLOCENE												Despite many studies of Holocene paleoclimate records from small lakes in the mid-continent of North America, direct estimates of lake-level changes associated with mid-Holocene aridity are rare. Varved sediments from Elk Lake, Clearwater County, Minnesota, are among the best studied in terms of paleoenvironmental proxies, yet the sedimentary architecture of those sediments has not been previously studied and the hydrological responses of the lake - changes in level and volume - are poorly known. High-resolution seismic-reflection (CHIRP) profiles of Elk Lake reveal complex sedimentary basins in the lake, a pattern of nearshore onlap of sediments onto older substrates, and the focusing of sediments into several deep basins. Biogenic gas obscures sediments in the deepest parts of the basins, but beneath the rest of the lake, a three-part Holocene sequence is clear. The transitions between these parts are correlated with lithological changes defined in earlier core studies. Sediments of the modern stage are less focused than those of the prairie lake stage. A prominent erosional unconformity occurs within the Holocene sequence, separating sediments from the prairie and modern stages of the lake. Erosion associated with this unconformity extends to a depth of 18.2 m below the modern water surface, at which point the unconformity grades into a conformable horizon within the sequence in the deep basins of the lake. This transition is an analog of the onlap of modern sediments onto older substrates, which occurs at a depth of about 8.2 m. The configuration of the erosional unconformity and its modern analog indicates a lake-level fall in the mid Holocene of 10.0 m. At its mid-Holocene minimum, the lake was 39% of its present size and 30% of its present volume, providing quantitative evidence to aid in constraining and evaluating reconstructions of mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North America.

J	Braby, MF; Douglas, F				Braby, MF; Douglas, F			The taxonomy, ecology and conservation status of the Golden-rayed Blue: a threatened butterfly endemic to western Victoria, Australia	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												The Golden-rayed Blue, Candalides noelkeri sp. nov. (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), from the Wimmera of western Victoria, Australia, is described and illustrated. The male and female genitalia and immature stages are figured, described and compared with those of Candalides heathi and C: xanthospilos. Candalides noelkeri sp. nov. is placed in the C. xanthospilos species-group, being most closely allied to and allopatric with C. heathi. It is predominantly univoltine, with adults usually present from late November to early February. However, it has a facultative pupal diapause that gives rise to a partial overlapping second generation in mid-summer. The species is ecologically specialized, monophagous and has a narrow geographical range, currently known only from two localities in a restricted area near Natimuk. Within this limited area it is restricted to flood plains bordering natural salt-lakes where the larval food plant, a prostrate form of Myoporum paruifolium (Myoporaceae), grows as a low spreading ground cover plant. Morphological and geological evidence suggest a recent (late Pleistocene) allopatric speciation event between C. noelkeri sp. nov. and C. heathi. The small, peripheral spatial distribution of C. noelkeri sp. nov. implies that differentiation has been achieved by the founder effect, either through peripheral isolates speciation (peripatric speciation) or postspeciation dispersal, possibly as a result of a barrier created by the volcanic plains in western Victoria. Available information indicates that C. noelkeri sp. nov., Victoria's only endemic species of butterfly, is facing a high risk of extinction and accordingly its conservation status should be considered as Endangered. The most serious threat at the type locality is habitat change or succession caused by invasion of Melaleuca halmaturorum, which is creating a dense shaded paperbark forest that is reducing both the preferred open sunny microhabitat and the extent of the larval food plant. Recognition of C. noelkeri sp. nov. as a flagship taxon is likely to enhance the conservation of biodiversity in remnant flood plain/salt-lake ecosystems of temperate south-eastern Australia.

J	Cotter, RC; Hines, JE				Cotter, RC; Hines, JE			Breeding biology of brant on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada	ARCTIC												The numbers of brant (Branta bernicla) in the Pacific Flyway are relatively small compared to other populations of arctic geese and have declined from historic levels. Little information is available on brant from Banks Island, although the size of the island and its location in the western Canadian Arctic make it a potentially important nesting area for this species. In 1992-93, we documented the distribution of nesting brant on the southern half of Banks Island through aerial surveys and carried out ground studies at the colonies to document nesting chronology and reproductive parameters. Ten colonies were found in 1992 (n = 159 nests) and 42 colonies (including seven colonies that had been active in 1992) and five solitary nests were found in 1993 (n = 514 nests). Two-thirds (67%) of the nesting locations supported 10 or fewer nests. Most colonies (36 of 45) were located on small islands (mean = 248 m(2)) in inland lakes or large ponds, and the remaining colonies (n = 9) were located on the mainland near active snowy owl (Nyctea scandiaca) nests. In 1993, when June temperatures were milder and snow melted sooner than in 1992, mean date of clutch initiation was significantly earlier (12 June vs. 20 June in 1992; p < 0.001) and mean clutch size was significantly larger (3.8 vs. 3.5 in 1992; p = 0.02). An index of productivity for the 21414 km(2) area surveyed in both years was much higher in 1993 (1339 young) than in the very late spring of 1992 (347 young). The number of adult brant on the survey area was similar in both years, and the lower productivity in 1992 was due primarily to fewer pairs' nesting that year. Smaller clutch size and lower nesting success may also have lowered productivity in 1992, but their effects appeared to be secondary. No correlation was found between colony size and clutch size, mean number of goslings hatched, or the percentage of nests that proved successful.																			0004-0843					DEC	2001	54	4					357	366																WOS:000173097000001

The primary goal is to assess the suitability of various proxies as representatives of modern vegetation, environmental and climatic conditions. The collected data indicate significant variations in the composition and density of pollen in response to climate-induced and anthropogenic ecological changes throughout the northwest India transect. The palynological studies from eastern Rajasthan shows high forest elements in comparison to western Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In addition, the palynological data was juxtaposed with other biotic proxies such as diatom and isotopic studies, along with geochemical proxies and paleomagnetic data of the surface lake sediments. The presence of marker pollen taxa including Cerealia type Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Brassicaceae, allows for distinct recognition of anthropogenic activities throughout the whole transect. The diversity and distribution of diatoms also support the palynological data in response to climate-induced and anthropogenic ecological changes. Furthermore, grain size, geochemistry (TOC/TN ratio with stable carbon isotope), and magnetic susceptibility data offer crucial insights about the sediment's depositional settings and general mineralogical composition. Stable carbon isotope data shows C-3 dominance in relatively humid areas and C-4 dominance in semi-arid areas, suggesting climate-driven control over sediment organic matter composition. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicates that biotic variables (pollen, diatom, stable isotopic composition) are significantly controlled by modern precipitation and temperature. Redundancy analysis reveals a significant influence of current average temperature and precipitation on major element oxide variations in surface lake sediments. Therefore, we propose using palynological, stable carbon isotope, diatom data, along with grain size, environmental magnetism, and geochemistry, to establish a multi- proxy modern analogue for quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions. As a result, this study provides the first modern analogues from a climate-sensitive region that separates the area under ISM influence from an area with meager precipitation in western India.					; ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025; Ikram, Mohammad Kamran/NSU-1836-2025; Manoj, M/AAR-1882-2020	Trivedi, Anjali/0000-0001-7835-0914; Manoj, M C/0000-0001-8112-6315; NAG, ANUPAM/0009-0001-6922-2758; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				OCT 30	2024	708						36	57		10.1016/j.quaint.2024.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.08.002		SEP 2024											WOS:001315480000001

The secondary history of Sutter's Mill CM carbonaceous chondrite based on water abundance and the structure of its organic matter from two clasts	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Sutter's Mill is a regolith breccia composed of both heavily altered clasts and more reduced xenoliths. Here, we present a detailed investigation of fragments of SM18 and SM51. We have characterized the water content and the mineralogy by infrared (IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the structure of the organic compounds by Raman spectroscopy, to characterize the secondary history of the clasts, including aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism. The three methods used in this study suggest that SM18 was significantly heated. The amount of water contained in phyllosilicates derived by TGA is estimated to be approximately 3.2 wt%. This value is quite low compared with other CM chondrites that typically range from 6 to 12 wt%. The infrared transmission spectra of SM18 show that the mineralogy of the sample is dominated by a mixture of phyllosilicate and olivine. SM18 shows an intense peak at 11.2 mu m indicative of olivine (Fig. 1). If we compare SM18 with other CM and metamorphosed CM chondrites, it shows one of the most intense olivine signatures, and therefore a lower proportion of phyllosilicate minerals. The Raman results tend to support a short-duration heating hypothesis. In the ID/IG versus FWHM-D diagram, SM18 appears to be unusual compared to most CM samples, and close to the metamorphosed CM chondrites Pecora Escarpment (PCA) 91008 and PCA 02012. In the case of SM51, infrared spectroscopy reveals that olivine is less abundant than in SM18 and the 10 mu m silicate feature is more similar to that of moderately altered CM chondrites (like Murchison or Queen Alexandra Range [QUE] 97990). Raman spectroscopy does not clearly point to a heating event for SM51 in the I-D/I-G versus FWHM-D diagram. However, TGA analysis suggests that SM51 was slightly dehydrated as the amount of water contained in phyllosilicates is approximately 3.7 wt%, which is higher than SM18, but still lower than phyllosilicate water contents in weakly altered CM chondrites. Altogether, these results confirm that fragments with different secondary histories are present within the Sutter's Mill fall. The dehydration that is clearly observed for SM18 is attributed to a short-duration heating based on the similarity of its Raman spectra to that of PCA 91008. Because of the brecciated nature of Sutter's Mill and the presence of adjacent clasts with different thermal histories, impacts that can efficiently fragment and heat porous materials are the preferred heat source.

J	BURROWS, WR				BURROWS, WR			OBJECTIVE GUIDANCE FOR 0-24-HOUR AND 24-48-HOUR MESOSCALE FORECASTS OF LAKE-EFFECT SNOW USING CART	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Lake-effect-snow-possible (LESP) days were identified for each of 29 climatological stations in the lee of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay for the November-to-April winters of 1984-1988, using 0-24-h and 24-48-h wind and temperature forecasts from the Canadian Meteorological Center operational spectral numerical weather prediction model. Observed 24-h snow amounts on LESP days were separated into five ordered categories. A symmetric distribution centered on category 3 (>5-12.5 cm) was found for the aggregate of the 29 stations, but the distributions for individual stations peaked on category 1 (0-trace) or category 2 (> trace-5 cm). This suggests lake-effect snow occurrence, and amounts are likely to be overforecast for specific sites and small areas in forecasts issued for many public forecast regions, whose boundaries tend to be large. A recently developed nonparametric classification procedure known as "Classification and Regression Trees (CART)" was used to find decision trees that classify the categorical snowfalls with threshold values of predictors in binary decision nodes. Predictors were designed from meteorological parameters known to be important in lake-effect snow formation, and were calculated from 0-24-h and 24-48-h forecast data from the NWP model on a 63-km interpolation grid. Verification with independent forecast data showed the CART forecasts to perform relatively well, considering the difficulty of the five-category mesoscale forecast problem. The best success was achieved with forecasts of snow not exceeding 5 cm. The success of forecasts for snow amounts greater than this for specific sites and small areas can be substantially increased when groups of forecasts for small areas are used. Predictors related to 1000-mb divergence were ranked among the most important predictors more frequently than any other types of predictors at nearly every station, followed by those related to air-water temperature difference. Some typical cases of 1000-mb divergence and accompanying snowfall patterns on LESP days are discussed.																			0882-8156					SEP	1991	6	3					357	378		10.1175/1520-0434(1991)006<0357:OGFHAH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1991)006<0357:OGFHAH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991GG19200004

Nesting Status and Chronology of Eared Grebes Along Great Salt Lake, Utah	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) are colonial-nesting waterbirds that breed in Canada and northern United States. Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, is vital to the survival of this species because all eared grebes in North America stage in the fall either on the GSL or Mono Lake, California. The importance of GSL and its surrounding wetlands for breeding eared grebes is unknown. We studied eared grebe nesting status and chronology in the freshwater wetlands around GSL and found over 4,280 nests distributed among 35 colonies during 2018 and 5,794 nests among 23 colonies during 2019. We also located the 2 largest colonies of this species ever recorded (902 and 1,492 nests). Mean clutch size differed between years and was 2.4 eggs during 2018 and 2.0 during 2019; clutch sizes were lower at GSL than in colonies located in more northern latitudes, perhaps due to a local paucity of invertebrate prey during the egg-laying period. Grebe nests around the GSL were constructed with, and anchored to, growing Stuckenia pectinate. Eared grebes near GSL started laying eggs in the first week of June during 2018 and a week later during 2019. The number of incubated nests per colony peaked on 27 June during 2018 and 9 July during 2019. Nests continued to be incubated into August in both years. These dates are later than those reported in more-northern colonies. The later nesting in GSL colonies could be due to the birds' need to wait for Stuckenia pectinata to form mats at the water surface. This plant species needs a water depth of 38 to 45 cm to thrive, and increasing amounts of freshwater from the GSL watershed are diverted for agriculture and human development. If this trend continues, there may not be enough water to maintain the required water depth for dense stands of Stuckenia; the loss of which may prevent the grebes from nesting.

BP recorded by a new chironomid record from Burgaschisee, Swiss Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The termination of the Last Ice Age after the Last Glacial maximum (LGM) represents a dynamic period in the history of the circum-north Atlantic region. So far, there are few reliably dated climatic reconstructions covering the Lateglacial period prior to 14,700 cal. BP in Central and Northern Europe. We present a new chironomid record for the period 18,000-14,000 cal. BP, from Burgaschisee, Switzerland. Chironomid assemblages immediately following glacier retreat were dominated by taxa indicative of cold, oligotrophic conditions such as Sergentia coracina-type and Micropsectra radialis-type. A gradual transition to assemblages with moderate abundances of taxa indicative of warmer climatic conditions such as Dicrotendipes nevosus-type and Tanytarsus glabrescens-type started after ca. 16,100 cal. BP. This initial and gradual chironomid assemblage shift culminated in a more pronounced and rapid inferred temperature change at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition at ca. 14,700 cal. BP, where further types indicative of warm conditions such as Tanytarsus lactescens-type first occurred and replaced chironomids indicative of colder conditions such as Paracladius and Protanypus. We estimated past July air temperature changes from the chironomid assemblages by applying to the record a chironomid-temperature transfer function that is based on chironomid distribution data from 274 lakes in Switzerland and Norway. The resulting reconstruction, which features a sample-specific root mean square error of prediction of 1.36-1.46 degrees C, indicates temperatures around 9 degrees C at the beginning of the record. An initial gradual warming phase initiating at ca. 16,100 cal. BP is recorded reaching values around 10 degrees C for the period 16,100-15,500 cal. BP. Temperatures continue to increase reaching values around 12 degrees C for the period preceding the Bolling warming, when temperatures rose rapidly to values around 15 degrees C. The early temperature rise to values of 10-12 degrees C prior to the Bolling warming agrees with widespread vegetation changes recently reported for this region based on palaeobotanical analyses, which indicate a shift from herbaceous tundra to shrub tundra with low density tree birch stands with open canopies. Together, these results suggest an earlier Lateglacial temperature increase in southwest Central Europe than expected based on earlier palaeobotanical reconstructions, although with a less pronounced warming than has been reported for ca. 16,000 cal. BP from south of the Alps. This early Lateglacial warming agrees with glacier reconstructions which suggest several step-wise reductions of glacier extent in this period as well as with evidence from other palaeotemperature reconstructions and suggests that not only Southern Europe but significant parts of Europe north of the Alps may have been characterized by early Lateglacial warming well before the rapid warming at ca. 14,700 cal.

Transtensional deformation of the brittle crust: Field observations and theoretical applications in the Coso-China lake region, Eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada microplate, southeastern California	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW												The focus of this work is the description of non-plane strain brittle deformation through field observations and theoretical applications. The seismically and volcanically active Coso-China Lake region in the transtensional Eastern California shear zone is an exemplary location for field observation of brittle structure. The region deforms in a constrictional strain field, well-described by earthquake focal mechanisms and GPS measurements, and further demonstrated by our field observations and outcrop-scale mapping. Fundamental geometric relationships in transtensional zones and tectonic reconstruction allows practical applications of theory using real transtension zone parameters, and expands our ability to describe triaxial strain in three dimensions. Theoretical instantaneous strain axes are constrictional and oriented x(j) WNW, y(i) NNE, z(i) vertical, similar to seismogenic and GPS derived instantaneous strain axes, and kinematic analysis of field data. Orientations of brittle structures in the field correspond reasonably well to theoretical predictions, with normal faults striking generally NNE, parallel to yi, dextral faults northwest to NNW, sinistral faults ENE, and fold axes and thrust faults WNW, parallel to xi. We calculate theoretical rates and amounts of shortening, elongation, and rotation for specific structures within the deformation zone; paleomagnetically-derived rotations in Pliocene volcanics fall within our predicted ranges. We subdivide the field area based on geometry and derive shapes and orientations of the instantaneous and finite strain ellipsoids and associated k-values (Northern Coso, k = 6.84; Southern Coso, k = 2.21). Our results indicate a less prolate, more coaxially-dominated, higher strain and strain rate in Southern Coso, and a more prolate, less coaxially dominated, lower strain and strain rate in Northern Coso, part of which is reflected by elevation and topography. We observe varying degrees of three-dimensional strain partitioning of brittle structures depending oil scale, as is also seen in seismicity, and possible partitioning of rotations around vertical and horizontal axes. Multi-scale partitioning of strain and rotation, influenced by preexisting and reactivated structures, characterizes transtensional deformation at Coso, and is well described by kinematic analysis of structural field observations and regional theoretical applications and analyses.																			0020-6814	1938-2839				MAR	2008	50	3					218	244		10.2747/0020-6814.50.3.218	http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0020-6814.50.3.218													WOS:000253925500003

Drift sands, lakes, and soils: the multiphase Holocene history of the Laarder Wasmeren area near Hilversum, the Netherlands	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES-GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW												A unique complex of multiphased Holocene drift sands and paleosols, with at least two lacustrine phases, was discovered during a major sanitation project in the Laarder Wasmeren area near Hilversum, the Netherlands. The complex could be studied in detail, highly facilitated by the excellent and large-scale exposure of the various deposits and soils. OSL dating was used to establish ages of the phases, where possible differentiating between time of deposition and time of burial by taking into account the potential effects of bioturbation. Pollen analysis served to reconstruct the vegetation during the various phases. A first minor phase of aeolian activity already started before approx. 5,000 BC, followed around 4,000 BC by a second phase and a rather massive third phase around 3,000 BC. After a long phase of soil formation, the latest, massive drift sand phase started around the 14th to 15th century. It clearly represents the classic drift sand phase that started in the Late Middle Ages in the Netherlands. Sand drifting followed on soil forming phases during which the vegetation became increasingly dominated by ericaceous plants and culminated in heathlands. The first three aeolian phases and associated heathlands are much older than generally assumed for heathland and drift sand to occur in the Netherlands. Moreover, podzolisation was found to have started very early, true podzols already occurring before 4,000 BC. Around 3,000 BC groundwater in the area reached a maximum altitude of about 230 cm +NAP, resulting in local open water in the area. This rise is probably linked to the development of the Dutch coastal area, where at that time peat accumulated and drainage was poor, inducing a rise of the groundwater level in 'het Gooi'. This groundwater level fell later on, to never reach this altitude again. The Groot Wasmeer was formed by local stagnation on a slowly permeable podzol and already reached a level of 320-325 cm +NAP by 400 BC, which more or less equals its 20th century level. The results demonstrate that earlier concepts on the occurrence and age of aeolian phases, podzols and heathland vegetations in the Netherlands are far too schematic, and that early, pre-agricultural cultures may already have had an impact on the stability of fragile cover sand landscapes, e.g. through burning. Results are in line with those from several contemporary studies on early prehistoric cultures and their impact in river dune areas in the Central and Eastern Netherlands.

It is the only significant source of meltwater, and hence allochthonous nutrients, to the lake. In recent years localised climatic change has resulted in an increase in the annual discharge in the river from 2.5x10(6) m(3) (1970s and early 1980s) to 5.5x10(6) m(3) (late 1980s and early 1990s). In order to better understand the potential consequences of increased river flow to nutrient loading to the lake, we undertook a series of studies in 1993/94 to identify the sources and sinks of nutrients within the Onyx River system. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients varied both with time and with distance down the river. During early flows the river water was rich in nutrients, with nitrate nitrogen reaching over 1500 mg m(-3) and dissolved reactive phosphorous 27 mg m(-3). This appeared to reflect two sources, freeze concentration of nutrients in the stream bed over winter, and selective enrichment with nitrate, probably via atmospheric deposition. Another source of nutrients during early flows was leaching from freeze damaged cells in microbial mats. However during these early flows much of this water did not reach Lake Vanda, but rather was lost to lateral groundwater recharge. During the main flow period, nutrients came predominantly from glacial melt, though nitrate enrichment persisted for several weeks. Water reaching Lake Vanda during the main flow period always had low concentrations of nutrients relative to source water. Two microbially active zones were identified which appeared to be responsible for nutrient stripping. These were Lake Brownworth at the head of the river and the "Boulder Pavement", some 4 km upstream of Lake Vanda. There was no relationship between discharge and nutrient concentrations and for most of the year a linear discharge:loading curve was found. Increased flows into Lake Vanda will therefore increase the nutrient loading, but have little effect on concentrations of nutrients in lake water, at least over the range of discharge seen in this study.																					90-5410-925-4				1997							155	170																WOS:000072809000015

However, the potential differences and biases in pollen assemblages from these two sample types, as well as the processes of pollen sedimentation in lake basins, have received relatively little attention. Here we present the results of the analysis of modern pollen assemblages in 10 surface sediment samples and 25 topsoil samples from Xingyun Lake and its catchment, a shallow alpine lake site in the central Yunnan Plateau, southwest China. The modern pollen assemblages from both types of samples are mainly composed of Pinus, evergreen and deciduous oaks, Alnus, Poaceae, Artemisia, Brassicaceae and Amaranthaceae, and are consistent with the modern vegetation. Although the pollen assemblages of topsoil samples vary with the type of modern local vegetation, in general they are representative in term of the composition of the main pollen taxa, with some significant differences in the case of some vegetation types. With regard to the surface lake sediment samples, the pollen assemblages are relatively constant with no significant changes with sample location and water depth. The main pollen taxa are Pinus (around 40%), Alnus (around 18%) and Poaceae (around 11%), with relatively high percentages of evergreen and deciduous oaks, Betula (2-4%), and low percentages of Ulmus, Rosaceae, Corylus, Cupressaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrica and Elaeagnaceae. This composition is a good representation of the main types of catchment vegetation. The relative uniformity of the pollen assemblages from the lake surface samples may partly result from the effect of currents in redistributing the pollen input to the lake by rivers and wind. Therefore, we suggest that it is better to use pollen data from surface lake sediments, rather than from topsoils from the lake catchment, for interpreting fossil pollen assemblages of lake sediment cores. Our results indicate that the pollen assemblages in a sediment core from any part of Xingyun Lake are likely to provide a reliable record of the regional vegetation history and thus climatic change. Our modern pollen results, together with modern pollen data from other surface lake sediment samples along a large altitudinal gradient from Yunnan to southwest Sichuan Province, were used to reanalyze fossil pollen assemblages during the Last Glaciation period at Xingyun Lake. The results show that the vertical vegetation belts decreased in altitude from late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (late MIS3) to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and then increased during the Last Deglaciation.

J	Vyshnevskyi, VI; Shevchuk, SA				Vyshnevskyi, Viktor, I; Shevchuk, Serhii A.			Use of remote sensing data to study ice cover in the Dnipro Reservoirs	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY												The information on the use of remote sensing data when studying the ice cover of the Dnipro Reservoirs is given. The main source of data was the images obtained by the satellites Sentinel-2, Landsat, Aqua and Terra. In addition, the observation data from the hydrological and meteorological stations were used. The combination of these data enabled to study the patterns of ice regime in the Dnipro Reservoirs, to specify some features that cannot be determined by regular monitoring. A typical feature of the ice cover of all reservoirs of the Dnipro Cascade, besides the Kyivske one, is the impact of hydropower plants (HPP) located upstream. The runoff of the rivers flowing into the Kyivske Reservoir significantly influences its ice cover. This is especially relates to the period of spring flood. Besides the Dnipro and the Pripyat Rivers, relatively small the Teteriv and the Irpin Rivers flowing from the south-west to the north-east have a rather significant effect on the ice cover of this reservoir. The distribution of ice cover in the Kanivske Reservoir, compared to the Kanivske one, is significantly less. In addition to more southern location and warmer climate, the city of Kyiv also influences the ice cover on it, namely due to the discharge of wastewater from several industrial enterprises, Kyivska TPP-5 and Bortnitska Station of Aeration are ones of them. The impact of Trypilska TPP, which located downstream, is also significant. The longest duration of ice cover in the Kanivske Reservoir is observed in its south-eastern part. A point of interest about the Kremenchuts'ke Reservoir is the fact that the ice cover in it remains for the longest period compared to the other reservoirs. The largest duration of ice cover in this reservoir is observed in the Sulska Bay. The typical feature of the Kamianske Reservoir is the accumulation of ice in its narrow parts. Within the Dniprovske Reservoir, the longest freezing period is observed in the Samara Bay. Besides the operation of hydropower station, the industrial enterprises of Kamianske town and Dnipro city have a great effect on the upper part of this reservoir. There are significant differences in the ice regime of the different parts of the Kakhovske Reservoir, which extends from the north-east to the south-west. The distribution of ice in its shallow north-eastern part is usually much larger than in narrower south-western part.

J	Foroughan, M; Lemmin, U; Barry, DA				Foroughan, Mehrshad; Lemmin, Ulrich; Barry, David Andrew			Effects of natural surfactants on the spatial variability of surface water temperature under intermittent light winds on Lake Geneva	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The spatial variability of Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) between smooth and rough surface areas and its potential asso-ciation with the natural surfactant distribution in the surface microlayer were investigated for the first time in a lake. In spring 2019, two different field campaigns were carried out in Lake Geneva to measure: (i) the enrichment factor of Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter (FDOM) as a proxy for biogenic surfactants, and (ii) LSWT and near-surface water temperature profiles while simultaneously monitoring water surface roughness in both cases. Results indicate that, under intense incoming short-wave radiation and intermittent light wind conditions, the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) was stable and the accumulation of heat due to short-wave radiation in near-surface waters was greater than heat losses by surface cooling, thus creating a diurnal warm layer with strong thermal stratification in the water near-surface layer. A threshold wind speed of 1.5 m s-1 was determined as a transition between different dynamic regimes. For winds just above 1.5 m s-1, the lake surface became patchy, and smooth surface areas (slicks) were more enriched with FDOM than rough areas (non-slick) covered with Gravity-Capillary Waves (GCW). Sharp thermal boundaries appeared between smooth and rough areas. LSWT in smooth slicks was found to be more than 1.5 degrees C warmer than in rough non-slick areas, which differs from previous ob-servations in oceans that reported a slight temperature reduction inside slicks. Upon the formation of GCW in non-slick areas, the near -surface stratification was destroyed and the surface temperature was reduced. Furthermore, winds above 1.5 m s-1 continuously fragmented slicks causing a rapid spatial redistribution of LSWT patterns mainly aligned with the wind. For wind speeds below 1.5 m s-1 the surface was smooth, no well-developed GCW were observed, LSWT differences were small, and strong near-surface stratification was established. These results contribute to the understanding and the quantification of air-water exchange processes, which are presently lacking for stable Atmospheric Boundary Layer conditions in lakes.

The core was taken at 41.95 degrees N, 111.31 degrees W, near the depocenter of the 60-m-deep, spring-fed, alkaline lake, where carbonate-bearing sediment has accumulated continuously. Chronological control is poor but indicates an average sedimentation rate of 0.54 mm yr(-1). Analyses have been completed at multi-centennial to millennial scales, including (in order of decreasing temporal resolution) sediment magnetic properties, oxygen and carbon isotopes on bulk-sediment carbonate, organic-and inorganic-carbon contents, palynology; mineralogy (X-ray diffraction), strontium isotopes on bulk carbonate, ostracode taxonomy, oxygen and carbon isotopes on ostracodes, and diatom assemblages. Massive silty clay and marl constitute most of the core, with variable carbonate content ( average = 31 +/- 19%) and oxygen-isotopic values (delta O-18 ranging from -18 parts per thousand to -5 parts per thousand in bulk carbonate). These variations, as well as fluctuations of biological indicators, reflect changes in the water and sediment discharged from the glaciated headwaters of the dominant tributary, Bear River, and the processes that influenced sediment delivery to the core site, including lake-level changes. Although its influence has varied, Bear River has remained a tributary to Bear Lake during most of the last quarter-million years. The lake disconnected from the river and, except for a few brief excursions, retracted into a topographically closed basin during global interglaciations (during parts of marine isotope stages 7, 5, and 1). These intervals contain up to 80% endogenic aragonite with high delta O-18 values (average = -5.8 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand), indicative of strongly evaporitic conditions. Interglacial intervals also are dominated by small, benthic/tychoplanktic fragilarioid species indicative of reduced habitat availability associated with low lake levels, and they contain increased high-desert shrub and Juniperus pollen and decreased forest and forest-woodland pollen. The Sr-87/Sr-86 values (>0.7100) also increase, and the ratio of quartz to dolomite decreases, as expected in the absence of Bear River inflow. The changing paleoenvironments inferred from BL00-1 generally are consistent with other regional and global records of glacial-interglacial fluctuations; the diversity of paleoenvironmental conditions inferred from BL00-1 also reflects the influence of catchment-scale processes.

Here, we present a pollen record covering the last 25,000 years from Lake Fuxian in central Yunnan, southwest China. Our study shows seven stages of vegetation dynamics since the LGM: The early LGM (stage 7 of 25,000-21,200 cal. a BP) witnessed less dense regional vegetation dominated by pine forests, evergreen broadleaved forests (EBFs), deciduous broadleaved forests (DBFs), montane hemlock forests, and fir/spruce forests. The late LGM (stage 6 of 21,200-17,500 cal. a BP) saw an expansion of grasslands, wetlands, and montane fir/spruce forests as well as a shrinkage of EBFs and DBFs. During the last deglaciation (stage 5 of 17,500-13,300 cal. a BP), dense regional vegetation was dominated by EBFs as well as deciduous oak and alder forests. The densest regional vegetation occurred in stage 4 of 13,300-11,200 cal. a BP, roughly equal to the Younger Dryas Chron, when pine forests, DBFs, EBFs, grasslands, and wetlands grew in the Lake Fuxian catchment. During the early to mid-Holocene (stage 3 of 11,200-5000 cal. a BP), dense regional vegetation was dominated by sweetgum forests, in addition to some pine forests and EBFs. After 5000 cal. a BP, the regional vegetation density became lower and lower, and forests became thinner and thinner. Pine forests expanded to their maximum of the entire sequence in stage 2 of 5000-2500 cal. a BP. A big deforestation event occurred in stage 1 (the last 2500 years), when grasslands, wetlands, and cultivated vegetation dominated regional vegetation in the catchment of Lake Fuxian. The regional vegetation since the LGM in the catchment of Lake Fuxian also experienced six major transitions, five centennial shift events, and one big large-scale and long-term deforestation event. These resulted from the responses of regional vegetation to climate changes during the LGM, last deglaciation, and early-mid-Holocene, as well as human influence in the late Holocene. The vegetation density since the LGM has changed with the 25 degrees N summer insolation.

J	Serreze, MC; Clark, MP; McGinnis, DL; Robinson, DA				Serreze, MC; Clark, MP; McGinnis, DL; Robinson, DA			Characteristics of snowfall over the eastern half of the United States and relationships with principal modes of low-frequency atmospheric variability	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Monthly data from 206 stations for the period 1947-93 are used to examine characteristics of snowfall over the eastern half of the United States and relationships with precipitation and the maximum temperature on precipitation days. Linkages between snowfall and modes of low-frequency circulation variability are diagnosed through composite analyses, based on results from a rotated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of monthly 500-hPa geopotential height. Results are examined for the 2-month windows of November-December, January-February, and March-April. The three dominant PCAs for each window capture regional components of the Pacific-North American (PNA), Tropical-Northern Hemisphere (TNH), and east Pacific (EP) teleconnection patterns. Two general snowfall regimes are identified: 1) the dry and cold upper midwest, Nebraska and Kansas, where snowfall is strongly a function of precipitation: and 2) the Midwest, southeast, and northeast, where snowfall is more closely tied to the mean maximum temperature on precipitation days. The PNA (the dominant circulation mode) and the EP pattern are both associated with strong snowfall signals, best expressed for November-December and January-February. Snowfall for the PNA over the southeast, midwest, and mid-Atlantic states Increases (decreases) under positive (negative) extremes, when the eastern United States is dominated by a strong 500-hPa trough (zonal how or weak ridge) with associated lower (higher) precipitation-day temperatures, Snowfall signals are more extensive under positive PNA extremes where the lower temperatures have a greater impact on precipitation phase. An opposing precipitation-controlled snowfall signal is found over the upper Midwest. The positive phase of the EP pattern, describing a western ridge-eastern trough, is associated with negative snowfall signals clustered over the midwest and upper midwest. Opposing signals are found under the midwestern trough-eastern ridge pattern of the negative mode. These signals are primarily precipitation controlled, which for the Midwest are counter to the climatological control by temperature. TNH snowfall signals are fairly weak except for March-April, when significant differences are found for the upper Midwest and from Missouri northeast into New England. No coherent trends are observed in snowfall or in the strength of the circulation patterns derived from the PCA.					; Clark, Martyn/AAH-9999-2020	Serreze, Mark C./0000-0001-7670-0140; 													0894-8755					FEB	1998	11	2					234	250		10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011<0234:COSOTE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011<0234:COSOTE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000072156100008
J	HULL, AG; NICHOLSON, C				HULL, AG; NICHOLSON, C			SEISMOTECTONICS OF THE NORTHERN ELSINORE FAULT ZONE, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Earthquake hypocenters and focal mechanisms, within and adjacent to the Elsinore-Temecula trough, are used to determine the contemporary pattern of subsurface deformation and fault geometry along the northern Elsinore fault zone. Instrumentally recorded earthquakes with magnitudes M(L) greater-than-or-equal-to 1.5 (1979 to 1989) were relocated using a velocity model derived from previous seismic refraction and velocity inversion studies in the Peninsular Ranges. Single-event focal mechanisms were determined for all events with at least 10 P-wave first motions. Our preferred hypocentral locations, combined with gravity modeling and additional geologic information, suggest considerable curvature and oblique motion along the Glen Ivy North fault. The fault at depth curves westwards away from the more linear surface trace and changes dip from near-vertical at Lake Elsinore to approximately 70-degrees-S and then 70-degrees to 75-degrees-SW along the base of the Santa Ana Mountains. Along the Wildomar and Willard faults, earthquakes tend to cluster, and focal mechanisms exhibit a mixed pattern of strike- and oblique-slip motion, particularly near the extrapolated intersection with the E-W oriented Murrieta Hot Springs fault. Distinct aseismic zones extending to depths of 10 km correlate with the two known areas of active subsidence in the Elsinore-Temecula trough. Average P axis from earthquake focal mechanisms for the 74 events analyzed, both on and off the fault zone, trends N01-degrees-W +/- 17-degrees -or about 45-degrees to 55-degrees from the various NW-striking segments of the northern Elsinore fault zone. The observed pattern of oblique-slip and nonvertical dips along active segments of the northern Elsinore fault zone is consistent with their young age (approximately 2.5 Ma) and their small cumulative horizontal offset (< 15 km) and with a model in which oblique strain has yet to be partitioned between vertical strike-slip and subparallel low-angle dip-slip faults, as is observed along segments of the San Andreas fault zone in central California.

Pb isotopic signals reveal that the local weathered granitoid was the dominant source of Pb deposition. However, two isotopic excursions appeared from 15.5-15.2 and 5.2-4.8 ka BP, which coincide with the dry/cold H1 event and the mid- and late-Holocene respectively, likely suggesting an additional contribution of aeolian dust from North China. Even more, more radiogenic Pb signal of E2 exhibits a mixed contribution of enhanced anthropogenic mining. We expect strong enough EAWM would dominate these two intervals. Supported by multi-proxy records, we conclude that variations Pb isotopic signals (e.g., Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios) are closely related to climate-induced chemical weathering. Synchronous variations of Pb-208/Pb-204, Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios in the core display a congruent Pb isotope signals released from both U- and Th-rich accessory minerals. During intensive chemical weathering under wetter/warmer conditions (e.g., the Bolling and Allerod events, and the Holocene Optimum period), more preferential release of radiogenic Pb-206, Pb-207 and Pb-208 can be absorbed by fine detritus and then eroded to the lake thus resulting in increased Pb-208/Pb-204, Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-207/(204) ratios in sediments, and vice versa if a drier/colder climate dominates (e.g., the H1, the Older and Younger Dryas events, and the mid- & late-Holocene). The inferred changes in chemical weathering from Dahu sediments have varied in tandem with multi-regional monsoonal proxies in China, and exhibited a sensitive response of chemical weathering to global climate change.

Insights from trace element content and crystal - Structure of spinels in African mantle xenoliths	LITHOS												The lithospheric architecture of Africa consists of several Archean cratons and smaller cratonic fragments, stitched together and flanked by polycyclic fold belts. Here we investigate the structure and chemistry of spinels from lithospheric mantle xenoliths from distinct tectonic settings, i.e. from the Saharan metacraton in Libya (Waw-En-Namus) which could show archaic chemical features, Cameroon (Barombi Koto and Nyos Lakes) where the Sub Continental Lithospheric Mantle was modified during the Pan-African event and fluxed by asthenospheric melts of the Tertiary Cameroon Volcanic Line and Morocco (Tafraoute, Bou-lbalrhatene maars) in the Middle Atlas where different metasomatic events have been recorded. From a structural point of view it is to notice that the Libyan spinels can be divided into two groups having different oxygen positional parameter (u > 0.2632 and u < 0.2627, respectively), while those from Cameroon are in between those values as the Moroccan ones already studied by other authors. The intracrystalline closure temperature (Tc) of the here studied spinels is different among the different samples with one Libyan group (LB I) showing Tc in the range 490-640 degrees C and the other 680-950 degrees C (LB II). Cameroon and Morocco spinets show a Tc in the range 630-760 degrees C. About 150 different spinels have been studied for their trace element content and it can be seen that many of them are related to Cr content, while Zn and Co are not and clearly distinguish the occurrences. Differences in the trace element chemistry, in the structural parameters and in the intracrystalline closure temperatures suggest that a different history should be considered for Cameroon, Morocco and LB I and LB II spinels. Even if it was not considered for this purpose, we tentatively used the Fe2+/Fe3+ vs. TiO2 diagram that discriminate between peridotitic and the so-called "magmatic" spinels, i.e. spinel crystallized from melts. LB I and LB II spinels plot in the peridotitic field while Cameroon and Morocco spinels fall in the magmatic one. Consequently, the xenoliths sampled from a probably juvenile SCLM at the edge of the most important lithospheric roots (i.e. Cameroon and Morocco) apparently have spinels possibly fractionated in situ from percolating melts and do not represent a real spinel-peridotite facies. On the contrary mantle xenoliths from Libya exhibit spinels with peridotitic features compatible with a slow ascent of a mantle diapir (plume). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Volcanic activity (assessed weekly by the SO(2)flux of Nyiragongo volcano plume over the 2007-2012 period) is highly positively correlated with the water conductivity, salinity and temperature of the Kivu lake. Over the 2007-2012 period, these three parameters were highly positively correlated with the temporal dynamics of cholera cases in the Katana health zone that border the lake. Meteorological variables (air temperature and rainfall), and the other water characteristics (namely pH and dissolved oxygen concentration in lake water) were unrelated to cholera dynamics over the same period. Over the 2016-2018 period, we sampled weekly lake water salinity and conductivity, and twice a month vibrio occurrence in lake water and fish. The abundance ofV.choleraein the lake was positively correlated with lake salinity, temperature, and the number of cholera cases in the population of the Katana health zone.V.choleraeabundance in fishes was positively correlated withV.choleraeabundance in lake water, suggesting that their consumption directly contaminate humans. The activity of the volcano, by controlling the physico-chemical characteristics of Lake Kivu, is therefore a major determinant of the presence of the bacillus in the lake. SO2 fluxes in the volcano plume can be used as a tool to predict epidemic risks. Author summary The area of the African Great Lakes has been an endemic area for cholera since the late 1970s. We focused on the Katana health zone, bordering Lake Kivu, as during outbreaks, this is, (together with the Kalemie health zone located along the west coast of the Tanganyika lake) the health zone in which the first cases of Cholera are usually observed, and the highest number of cases are also usually reached in this area. The persistence of this aquatic bacillus, usually associated with warm and salty waters, led us to formulate the hypothesis that the geothermal springs supplying Lake Kivu, mainly from the Nyiragongo volcano, should control the physico-chemical characteristics of the lake and promote the persistence of the bacillus. The lake would thus be a reservoir of the pathogen, which could contaminate local residents through the consumption of water and fish. Over the 2007-2012 period, we demonstrated a long-term unidirectional relationship between volcanic activity and cholera cases in the Katana health Zone. Contamination of the lake's water and fish was also correlated to the lake characteristics. The activity of the volcano can thus be used for predicting epidemic risks.					bornette, gudrun/J-6404-2017; Giraudoux, Patrick/B-9274-2011	bornette, gudrun/0000-0002-2242-0060; Giraudoux, Patrick/0000-0003-2376-0136													1935-2735					AUG	2020	14	8							e0008406	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008406								32776919					WOS:000561393300006
J	Hurst, AW; McGinty, PJ				Hurst, AW; McGinty, PJ			Earthquake swarms to the west of Mt Ruapehu preceding its 1995 eruption	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Some months prior to the 1995 eruption of Mt Ruapehu (New Zealand), a series of shallow earthquake swarms occurred about 15-20 km west of the summit of Ruapehu. Several earthquakes in these swarms were felt, and the largest event was M-L 4.8. Cmstal earthquakes of M-L greater than or equal to 3.0 within 20 km of the summit of Ruapehu have been rather uncommon in recent years. Furthermore, the two periods of strongest activity were both just before times when the temperature of Crater Lake showed rapid increases. The second of these rapid heating phases was immediately followed by increases in the Mg2+ ion concentration in Crater Lake, indicating that chemical interactions were occurring between fresh magmatic material and the lake water. The coincidence between seismicity and lake changes suggested a link with the following eruption. A 1-D simultaneous inversion to locate the earthquakes more accurately showed that most of the earthquakes fell into three spatial clusters, each cluster having a small horizontal cross-section. The predominant depth was about 10-16 km. The b-value of this swarm was 0.74, quite compatible with ordinary tectonic earthquakes. Each cluster of earthquakes lies close to the normal Raurimu Fault which runs predominantly north-south to the west of Ruapehu, with an east-trending branch splaying off near its northern end (see Fig. 1b). Composite focal mechanisms of events in the two more southern clusters are oblique-normal, while the other cluster to the north has an oblique-reverse mechanism. The two oblique-normal mechanisms suggest that extension has occurred on part of the fault. This stress pattern was also observed in the focal mechanism solutions of events that occurred after the eruption, when a denser network of portable seismographs covered the region. Although we cannot definitely connect the occurrence of these swarms to the eruptions later in 1995, there is a strong suggestion that the seismicity was connected to the process of magma movement, which temperature and chemical changes in Crater Lake suggest was occurring during the first half of 1995.

The water quality is monitored regularly in accordance to the EC-Directive 76/160/EC and especially to the more rigorous Austrian Standard M6230. Since redevelopment measures of the lakes have been nearly finished the water quality found has improved essentially. In spite of these monitored data no effective correlation to data from the concerning ambulant sector of medical care could be established. The Carinthian Sentinel Practice Network started in summer 1994 to retrieve informations about occurrence and frequency of bathing related illness of children up to 16 years old. The 26 participating primary health care and pediatric physicians, having their own independent practices spread all over the country, reported the specific doctor-patient-contacts to the coordinating baser Criteria for inclusion in the medical report were head ache, sore throat, otalgia, stomach-ache, nausea, emesis, diarrhoea, fever, rhinitis, cough, cold, moreover conjunctivitis, skin rash and specific dermatitis. In addition physicians reported where, how long and how often the children had been bathing and how long they had been free of symptoms afterwards. Each case was reported to the coordinating base including a presumed diagnosis. Statistic evaluation showed that bathing related illness may be divided into three main groups according to symptom frequency. The frequency of otalgia (32,4%) was significantly higher than any other symptom asked for. Two groups of symptoms correlate with each other: on one hand rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough and sore throat (36,5%) and on the other hand nausea, emesis, diarrhoea and fever (41,9%). These data underline conclusions drawn by other authors but are not representative enough to correlate to data from water monitoring. First results suggest that conclusions for public health authorities can be drawn from this additional information about the state of the lakes and ponds - providing a sufficient number of data is reported.																			0934-8859					DEC	1995	198	2					165	171											9376046					WOS:A1995TP53900006

The two primary tools that fall under the xGDS umbrella are the xGDS Web Tools (xGDS-WT) and Visual Environment for Remote Virtual Exploration (VERVE). IRG has also developed a hardware and software system that is closely integrated with our xGDS tools and is used in multiple field experiments called Gigapan Voyage. xGDS-WT, VERVE, and Gigapan Voyage are examples of IRG projects that improve the ratio of science return versus development effort by creating generic and reusable tools that leverage existing technologies in both hardware and software. xGDS Web Tools provides software for gathering and organizing mission data for science and engineering operations, including tools for planning traverses, monitoring autonomous or piloted vehicles, visualization, documentation, analysis, and search. VERVE provides high performance three dimensional (3D) user interfaces used by scientists, robot operators, and mission planners to visualize robot data in real time. Gigapan Voyage is a gigapixel image capturing and processing tool that improves situational awareness and scientific exploration in human and robotic analog missions. All of these technologies emphasize software reuse and leverage open source and/or commercial-off-the-shelf tools to greatly improve the utility and reduce the development and operational cost of future similar technologies. Over the past several years these technologies have been used in many NASA-led robotic field campaigns including the Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS), the Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP), the K10 Robotic Follow-Up tests, and most recently we have become involved in the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) field experiments. A major objective of these joint robot and crew experiments is to improve NASAs understanding of how to most effectively execute and increase science return from exploration missions. This paper focuses on an integrated suite of xGDS software and compatible hardware tools: xGDS Web Tools, VERVE, and Gigapan Voyage, how they are used, and the design decisions that were made to allow them to be easily developed, integrated, tested, and reused by multiple NASA field experiments and robotic platforms.

Sizes, condition factors and sex ratios of the scattered populations of the small cichlid fish, Alcolapia grahami, that inhabits the lagoons and sites of Lake Magadi (Kenya), one of the most extreme aquatic habitat on Earth	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Alcolapia grahami is a small cichlid fish that inhabits the scattered lagoons and sites of Lake Magadi (Kenya). Exceptional physiological, morphological, biochemical and behavioural adaptations allow the fish to tolerate the harsh environmental conditions that exist in the locations, the most extreme milieus occupied by a species of fish on Earth. The temperature of the water is inordinately high for a fish; large diurnal fluctuations in the levels of the partial pressure of oxygen occur, with acute hypoxia happening during the night and hyperoxia during the day; the salinity of the water is similar to 60% of that of seawater and; the pH may be as high as 11. Having an average adult body length of less than 6 cm and a body mass of similar to 5 g, the fish is very small in size. Here, body mass, body length, condition factors (CFs) and sex ratios (SRs) were determined on fish sampled from nine accessible isolated populations. Except for the Cement Water Holding Tanks (CWHT) population, where the female-to-male SR was 4:1, overall, the number of male fish surpassed the female ones by a ratio of similar to 2:1. The male fish were heavier and longer compared to the female ones. The relatively lower ambient temperature in the CWHT (32 degrees C) may explain the female dominated population and the effect future increase in temperature may have on sex distribution in the various populations of A. grahami. In fish from the Fish Spring Lagoons B and D, the CFs were greater in the male fish relative to the female ones. Exhibiting poor-to-fair body states, the CFs of the different populations of A. grahami, that ranged from 1.1. to 1.8, were among the lowest that have been reported in fish living under natural setting. The skewed SRs and the markedly low CFs of A. grahami reported here may be ascribed to the harsh (stressful) environmental conditions the fish contends with. The values may signal prospective demise of the fish. Conservation measures are urgently needed to protect a very rare fish.

We determined the concentrations of 19 elements and the compositions of stable S and Sr isotopes in the main tributaries of the lake and compared them with the corresponding values obtained from the lake water during the circulation period. Results of a principal component analysis indicated that the components dissolved in the lower reaches of the tributaries can be divided into group 1 (HCO3, SO4, NO3, Ca, Mg, Sr) and group 2 components (Cl, Br, Na, K, Ba, Rb, Cs). The concentrations of group 1 components were high in the rivers of the southern area, which is urbanized and densely populated, and the eastern area, which consists of plains where agriculture predominates, compared with the rivers of the northern and western areas, which are mostly mountainous and sparsely populated. The concentrations of group 2 components tended to be high in the river water of industrial areas. The delta S-34 values of SO4 in the river water converged to 0 +/- 2 parts per thousand as the SO4 concentration increased and, excluding the areas where limestone is extensively distributed, as the HCO3 concentration increased. In particular, both the delta S-34 values (0 +/- 2 parts per thousand) and the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7117 +/- 0.0005) fell within narrow ranges in the small and medium rivers of the eastern plain area, where rice is widely grown. These values agreed respectively with the delta S-34 values of the fertilizers used in the Lake Biwa basin and the soil-exchangeable Sr-87/Sr-86 in the eastern plain. The characteristics of water quality in the small and medium rivers of the eastern area can be explained by a model in which sulfuric, nitric, and bicarbonic acids generated by the decomposition of agricultural fertilizer and paddy rice selectively leached out alkaline-earth elements adsorbed on the soil and sediments of the plain or dissolved calcium carbonate enriched with Mg and Sr. Compared with tributary waters, the lake water was depleted in NO3, owing to denitrification, and in Mn, owing to mineralization, which occur under the redox condition of bottom sediments. Excluding NO3 and Mn, the compositions of both the dissolved elements and the Sr and S isotopes in the water of Lake Biwa can be approximately reproduced by simple mixing of the tributary water, indicating that these components provide effective indices for evaluating the relationship between the waters of the lake and its tributaries.

Lacustrine sediments and lichen transplants: two contrasting and complimentary environmental archives of natural and anthropogenic lead in the South Urals, Russia	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lead (Pb) concentrations and isotope ratios of two different geochemical archives are compared; lake sediment cores and lichens (Hypogymnia physodes, naturally growing and transplanted) from a ca. 80 km-long transect centred on the Cu smelter and former mining town of Karabash, Ural Mountains, Russia. Lead concentrations in sediment cores from 10 lakes were generally low near their base and show an abrupt increase in their upper portions interpreted to coincide with the onset of large-scale smelting operations in 1910. Lead isotope ratios derived from Pb-204, Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208 of the bottom layers differed significantly from those of the top. The top sediments have isotope ratios that show distinct end members, one of which was the stack dust from the Karabash smelter, which is similar to the Pb derived from ores from Sibay, a major mine in the Urals. The composition of the bottom sediment layers generally fall slightly off a mixing line between the top sediments and average Earth's upper crust. Lichens transplanted from a reference site, as well as naturally growing lichens, sampled from southwest of the smelter have isotope ratios similar to those of the stack dust. Lichens to the northeast contained Pb from the smelter, but are increasingly influenced by other sources probably leaded petrol and local soils, and a signature derived from a source enriched in Pb-207. Vegetables collected from local kitchen gardens contained Pb from an additional atmospheric source, possibly coal. Our work confirms that: (1) Pb isotopes in lake sediments provide a long-term record of inputs and allows the characterisation of natural and anthropogenic sources; (2) Pb isotopes in lichens provide a short-term record of local and long-range atmospheric deposition at high spatial resolution and short time scales as they replace their Pb content within a few months; (3) determination of all four stable Pb isotopes is necessary for the identification of the sources of Pb and is extremely sensitive for discerning minor source signatures, even in an area with a dominant source such as a smelter. Particularly significant for the Karabash area is that ore-smelter-derived airborne Pb is a major component in the lake sediments and lichens but its contribution reaches insignificant levels ca. 40 km from the smelter.

J	WIGAND, PE				WIGAND, PE			DIAMOND POND, HARNEY-COUNTY, OREGON - VEGETATION HISTORY AND WATER-TABLE IN THE EASTERN OREGON DESERT	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Cores obtained in 1978 from Diamond Pond, Diamond Craters, Harney County, Oregon, as part of the Steens Mountain Prehistory Project, provide a record of vegetation change on the sagebrush/shadscale ecotone and of local and perhaps regional water tables. Pollen, macrofossils, sediments, and charcoal from these radiocarbon-dated cores were analyzed. Varying abundance of juniper, grass, sagebrush, and greasewood pollen, and of aquatic to littoral plant macrofossils reflects changing regional effective moisture and local water table since 6000 B.P. Eleven dates spanning 5200 radiocarbon years and four regionally correlated volcanic ashes establish the dating of seven periods of different moisture regimes: 1. Greasewood and saltbush pollen dominance before 5400 B.P. indicates shadscale desert. Rapid accumulation of alternating silts and medium sands lacking aquatic plant macrofossils and pollen reflects periods of ephemeral ponds with water table 17 m below the present level and considerable erosion of maar slopes. 2. Increasing sagebrush pollen from 5400 to 4000 B.P. indicates sagebrush expansion into shadscale desert. Scirpus, Rumex, Ceratophyllum, and Polygonum persicaria macrofossils and finely laminated clayey silts evidence perennial pond. 3. From 4000 to 2000 B.P. abundant juniper and grass pollen reflects extensive juniper grasslands (juniper seeds from trees growing nearby fell into the pond during this period). Rising charcoal values indicate greater importance of fire. Deepest late-Holocene pond ca 3700 B.P. corresponds with postulated intensive human occupation of northern Great Basin marsh and lake locales. 4. Between 2000 and 1400 B.P. increased sagebrush pollen mirrors reduced effective moisture and reexpanding sagebrush steppe. More abundant Scirpus and Rumex macrofossils evidence shallow pond. 5. From 1400 to 900 B.P. more numerous grass pollen indicates returning greater effective moisture resulting in deeper water with abundant Potamogeton. 6. About 500 B.P. increased greasewood and saltbush pollen evidences drought. Ruppia seeds and pollen and the mollusk Musculium indicate shallow, brackish water. 7. Abundant juniper and grass pollen reflects moister conditions between 300 and 150 B.P. Numerous Ceratophyllum fruits indicate deeper, freshened water. Since the mid-1800s man and changing climate have encouraged sagebrush reexpansion. Increased Scirpus macrofossils indicate shallower water.																			0017-3614					JUL 31	1987	47	3					427	458																WOS:A1987L040700007

FEATURES OF INTERACTION IN THE WATER-ROCK SYSTEM: A CASE STUDY OF THE IMANDRA LAKE CATCHMENT (THE KOLA PENINSULA)	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is caused by the fact that when assessing the ecological and geochemical state of the natural environment, it is necessary to take into account the ratio of natural and technogenic processes occurring in all its components (soil, water, air, etc.). So, the main natural process that determines the enrichment of water with chemical elements is their interaction with rocks. However, the processes in the water-rock system can be significantly affected by the anthropogenic factor. In this regard, a deep understanding of the characteristics of hydrogeochemical processes within territories subject to significant technogenic impact is an important task of modern ecogeochemistry. The main aim is to study the water-rock interaction features under technogenic environment conditions in a case of Lake Imandra catchment (the Kola Peninsula). Objects of the research are natural waters of the Imandra lake catchment (the Kola Peninsula). Methods. Classical methods of analysis were used to determine the major ion concentration. To determine the trace elements in water, a NexION 300D inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer was used. Saturation index (SI) was calculated by PHREEQC. Results. It has been established that within the catchment area of Lake Imandra, low-mineralized natural waters of predominantly hydrocarbonate calcium composition with a neutral and slightly alkaline environment are widespread. The specificity of the chemical composition of the waters of the western and eastern parts of the territory under consideration is determined by the combined influence of natural and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the technogenic impact of the Severonickel plant is confirmed by the increased concentrations of nickel and copper in the surface waters of the western part of the territory. The considered natural waters are not in equilibrium with the primary aluminosilicate minerals and are saturated with hydroxides, iron and aluminum oxides and, to a lesser extent, copper, kaolinite, and, at some points, illite, Ca- and Mg-montmorillonite. From the standpoint of evolutionary development, the high intensity of water exchange in the territory under consideration is a factor that determines the presence of the water-rock system at the initial stages. The presence of copper oxides and hydroxides in the equilibrium mineral phase indicates the influence of technogenic factors on the processes of interaction in the water-rock system.

A precautionary tale for urban planners	PEERJ												Frame Lake, located within the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, has been identified as requiring significant remediation due to its steadily declining water quality and inability to support fish by the 1970s. Former gold mining operations and urbanization around the lake have been suspected as probable causes for the decline in water quality. While these land-use activities are well documented, little information is available regarding their impact on the lake itself. For this reason, Arcellinida, a group of shelled protozoans known to be reliable bioindicators of land-use change, were used to develop a hydroecological history of the lake. The purpose of this study was to use Arcellinida to: (1) document the contamination history of the lake, particularly related to arsenic (As) associated with aerial deposition from mine roaster stacks; (2) track the progress of water quality deterioration in Frame Lake related to mining, urbanization and other activities; and (3) identify any evidence of natural remediation within the lake. Arcellinida assemblages were assessed at 1-cm intervals through the upper 30 cm of a freeze core obtained from Frame Lake. The assemblages were statistically compared to geochemical and loss-on-ignition results from the core to document the contamination and degradation of conditions in the lake. The chronology of limnological changes recorded in the lake sediments were derived from Pb-210, C-14 dating and known stratigraphic events. The progress of urbanization near the lake was tracked using aerial photography. Using Spearman correlations, the five most significant environmental variables impacting Arcellinida distribution were identified as minerogenics, organics, As, iron and mercury (p < 0.05; n = 30). Based on CONISS and ANOSIM analysis, three Arcellinida assemblages are identified. These include the Baseline Limnological Conditions Assemblage (BLCA), ranging from 17-30 cm and deposited in the early Holocene >7,000 years before present; the As Contamination Assemblage (ACA), ranging from 7-16 cm, deposited after similar to 1962 when sedimentation began in the lake again following a long hiatus that spanned to the early Holocene; and the Eutrophication Assemblage (EA), ranging from 1-6 cm, comprised of sediments deposited after 1990 following the cessation of As and other metal contaminations. The EA developed in response to nutrient-rich waters entering the lake derived from the urbanization of the lake catchment and a reduction in lake circulation associated with the development at the lake outlet of a major road, later replaced by a causeway with rarely open sluiceways. The eutrophic condition currently charactering the lake-as evidenced by a population explosion of eutrophication indicator taxa Cucurbitella tricuspis-likely led to a massive increase in macrophyte growth and winter fish-kills. This ecological shift ultimately led to a system dominated by Hirudinea (leeches) and cessation of the lake as a recreational area.

J	FERGUSON, RG				FERGUSON, RG			THE PREFERRED TEMPERATURE OF FISH AND THEIR MIDSUMMER DISTRIBUTION IN TEMPERATE LAKES AND STREAMS	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Laboratory studies of preferred temperature in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) are compared with results from 21 other species. These show that temperature, if acting alone, can determine the distribution of fish in laboratory apparatus. Factors such as light, conditioned responses related to feeding routines, and social behavior can interfere with the expression of the response to temperature. Subdued lighting conditions were necessary in experiments with Oncorhynchus, Salvelinus and Coregonus, whereas full daylight was required in experiments with Perca. The preferred temperature is considerably higher than the acclimation temperature at low thermal acclimations, but this difference decreases up to the final preferendum, where both coincide. The final preferendum and the relation between acclimation and preferred temperature is characteristic for the species. The shape of the resulting curve aids in interpreting observations of fish mortalities and distribution in nature. The final preferendum of perch from the present work was 24.2[degree]C, from other work using older fish it was 21.0[degree]. Summer field observations of yellow perch in certain lakes in Ontario showed average thermal distribution of 19.7[degree], 21.0[degree] and 21.2[degree] respectively. This agrees well with 20.8[degree]observed in 4 Wisconsin lakes. Oxygen depletion reported for Tennessee reservoirs, distribution of primary prey species of lake trout in New York waters, and other factors, have been shown to modify the thermal distribution in nature. Differential sex response to temperature may be important in the perch. Field observations of thermal distributions for certain species are also presented. Laboratory and field data show good agreement in fish having colder final preferenda, while fish with warmer final preferenda showed higher temperatures in the laboratory than in the field. Young perch showed similar results, but older perch showed excellent agreement between laboratory results and field observations. The lack of agreement is attributed to age differences; laboratory experiments being performed on young fish and field observations being made on older fish.																									1958	15	4					607	624		10.1139/f58-032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f58-032													WOS:A1958WZ01300010

Lake Zub (alternately named Lake Priyadarshini and referred to throughout as Lake Zub/Priyadarshini) is the second-largest lake in the oasis, and its maximum depth is 6 m. The lake is also among the warmest glacial lakes in the oasis, and it is free of ice during almost 2 summer months. The summertime evaporation over the ice-free lake was measured using the eddy covariance method and estimated on the basis of five indirect methods (bulk-aerodynamic method and four combination equations). We used meteorological and hydrological measurements collected during a field experiment carried out in 2018. The eddy covariance method was considered the most accurate, and the evaporation was estimated to be 114 mm for the period from 1 January to 7 February 2018 (38 d) on the basis of this method. The average daily evaporation was 3.0 mm d(-1) in January 2018. During the experiment period, the largest changes in daily evaporation were driven by synoptic-scale atmospheric processes rather than local katabatic winds. The bulk-aerodynamic method suggests the average daily evaporation is 2.0 mm d(-1), which is 32% less than the results based on the eddy covariance method. The bulk-aerodynamic method is much better in producing the day-to-day variations in evaporation compared to the combination equations. All selected combination equations underestimated the evaporation over the lake by 40 %-72 %. The scope of the uncertainties inherent in the indirect methods does not allow us to apply them to estimate the daily evaporation over Lake Zub/Priyadarshini. We suggested a new combination equation to evaluate the summertime evaporation over the lake's surface using meteorological observations from the nearest site. The performance of the new equation is better than the performance of the indirect methods considered. With this equation, the evaporation over the period of the experiment was 124 mm, which is only 9% larger than the result according to the eddy covariance method.					; Shevnina, Elena/AAX-2187-2020; Thakur, Praveen/G-4295-2010; Vihma, Timo/ABC-9771-2020	Naakka, Tuomas/0000-0003-1670-1410; Dhote, Pankaj R./0000-0002-3483-0059; Shevnina, Elena/0000-0003-0739-9977; Thakur, Praveen Kumar/0000-0002-2719-7021; Potes, Miguel/0000-0002-8912-5277													1994-0416	1994-0424				AUG 2	2022	16	8					3101	3121		10.5194/tc-16-3101-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3101-2022													WOS:000834936300001

After Lake Koucha was established about 16 cal ka BP, oligohaline conditions gradually converted to mesohaline conditions about 10 cal ka BP clearly suggesting that the water body was a closed-basin lake. From about 10 cal ka BP, the salinity of the lake rose continuously until hyperhaline levels were reached about 7.5 cal ka BR This increase in salinity was accompanied by a failing lake level. Extreme rainfall and flooding events in a generally dry climate hit the shallow saline lake around 8.5 cal ka BP causing a unique, thin gravel-containing layer within the continuous fine-grained lake sediments. The age control of our record does not allow us to correlate this event exactly to the widely recorded 8.2 cal ka BP event, however, the recovered sediments from Lake Koucha provide strong evidence that climate changes around 8.5 cal ka BP had significant environmental implicalions in northeastern Tibet. After about 7.3 cal ka BP, the available moisture significantly increased causing a continuous salinity decline until the present-day freshwater conditions of a through-flow take were established about 6.5 cal ka BP in Lake Koucha. This major shift from a shallow saline to a deeper freshwater lake was probably accompanied by a fundamental change from a macrophyte-dominated to a phytoplankton-dominated lake. A slight reduction in available moisture in comparison to the periods before and afterward was recorded between 4.3 and 2.0 cal ka BP, in phase with numerous records from monsoonal Asia, The reconstructed overall change in moisture availability from dry conditions before about 7.3 cal ka BP to wetter conditions afterwards contradicts most palaeoclimate records from the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings which show that wetter conditions in the early Holocene were replaced by drier and probably cooler conditions in the mid and late Holocene. However, in the semi-arid region of Lake Koucha with a mean annual precipitation of about 500 mm, the insolation-cl riven strengthened monsoon in the early Holocene may have resulted in a temperature rise and higher evaporation rates which outweighed the increase in precipitation and therefore led to significantly lower moisture availability. Our record provides further evidence for a regionally non-uniform response of the available moisture evolution to the overall monsoonal signal in the Holocene climate history of Central Asia.

ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL EVAPORATION IN THE AKTRU MOUNTAIN-GLACIER BASIN BASED ON ACTUAL DATA AND GIS-BASED MODELING	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												Monitoring and modeling of potential evaporation are necessary to understand completely the factors which influence hydrological regime of the high-mountain basin. Under conditions of the extremely poorly hydrometeorological information to calculate evaporation at the mountain territory, it is advisable to apply the combined method using direct network measurement of standard pan-evaporators, meteorological monitoring, as well as modern software tools of the modeling environment conditions and factors controlling the process. Aktru mountain-glacier basin was chosen as the territory of the study because it is typical for the Central Altai. The calculation of the actual evaporation from the water surface was carried out on two water-evaporation sites located in different landscape-altitude zones and equipped with standard GGI-3000 pan-evaporators. Based on the measured temperature gradients and the coefficient of daily anisotropic heating, the spatial distribution of temperatures of the surface air layer was calculated in the form of GRID matrices. Based on the digital elevation model in the SAGA GIS package, the indicators of sunshine time and the coefficients of the spatial distribution of potential incoming solar radiation over the studied basin were calculated. The calculation of evaporation from the water surface was carried out using L. Turk's and N.N.Ivanov's empirical formulas. Verification of GIS-based modeling was carried out under direct observations in the summer of 2022 in the Aktru mountain-glacial basin. It is important to note that in Aktru, June turned out to be the warmest month of 2022. A relationship has been established between evaporation from standard evaporators and climatic factors. It has been revealed that evaporation may increase with elevation. Partly, this fact can be explained by the local conditions of the location of the equipment. Thus, on the Goluboye Lake, there is a high wind speed and an increased incoming total solar radiation compared to the Aktru hydrometeorological station, which located in a valley depression. The results of the study are important for building a regional model of the hydrological cycle of the Altai mountain-glacial basins.

J	Abesser, C; Robinson, R				Abesser, Corinna; Robinson, Ruth			Mobilisation of iron and manganese from sediments of a Scottish Upland reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												High concentrations of manganese (>50 mu g L-1) and iron (>226-467 mu g L-1) have caused water quality problems at the Megger Reservoir during an excessive draw down of the reservoir water level in 1997/98. Sediment column studies were carried out to investigate how internal processes, namely sediment resuspension and diffusion from the sediment, contribute to the mobilisation of these elements in the water column. It was found that sediment resuspension is by far the more effective mechanism in mobilising iron and manganese and also causes persistent discolouration of the water. Concentrations of up to 80 mg L-1 iron and 16 mg L-1 manganese were observed in the experimental core water columns which are equivalent to 490 mu g L-1 and 97 mu g L-1 in a 27 m water column (= maximum water depth during reservoir draw down in 1997/98). From sediment particle size data it was calculated that wind speeds over 13 m s(-1) can trigger sediment resuspension at water depths of up to 20 m and have the potential to disturb sediments in large parts (>25 degrees, at full capacity) of the reservoir. Under current climate conditions, such wind events are infrequent but increasing wind speeds and rainfall intensities, as predicted by climate change scenarios, may cause resuspension events to become more frequent, reducing the reservoir's water quality over prolonged periods and limiting its use as a drinking water resource. Such resuspension events are also expected to occur in other water bodies in the study region, adversely affecting their water quality and increasing the ecosystem productivity. Diffusion from the sediment mostly affects the cycling of manganese, Maximum concentration in the experimental columns were equivalent to 70-130 mu g L-1 in a 3-5 m water column and were comparable to in-situ concentrations measure din the bottom waters of the reservoir (3-5 m above the sediment) during summer stratification. Sediment release is unlikely to cause serious water quality problems as only a limited amount of available manganese is found within the sediment. However, the accumulation of manganese and iron in the bottom waters may increase with changing climatic condition, in particular when the external inputs of these elements increase as a result of higher catchment loading associated with the predicted rise in rainstorm intensities.

J	Head, HV; Bordy, EM				Head, Howard V.; Bordy, Emese M.			Loess or lake sediments: Resolving the origin of massive beds in the Lower Jurassic of southern Africa	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Throughout Earth's history, dust deposits have been considered sensitive markers of fluctuations in global atmospheric circulation patterns. However, the identification of ancient dust deposits remains problematic, as their massive (structureless) nature impedes an unequivocal classification. In southern Africa, the Lower Jurassic Clarens Formation is dominated by intriguing structureless sandy siltstones that have been interpreted as loess even though classical diagnostic outcrop-scale loess features are not observed. In this study, we utilized grain characteristics such as size, shape, sorting and fabric to assess the origin of these ubiquitous massive beds, as compared to strata with a known origin in the unit. Based on these grain characteristics, the massive beds can be grouped into six different facies types (Facies 1-6). Facies 1 has very similar grain features to the large-scale cross-bedded strata and thus it is interpreted as migrating dune deposits, only apparently massive. The dominant grain size with a large proportion of very fine-grained sand and the random grain fabric suggests that Facies 2 resulted from sandy dust fall (short-term suspension), whereas Facies 3 is interpreted as aeolian dust, having features consistent with modern and ancient loess due to its dominant silt grain size and random grain fabric. Features in Facies 4 are undiagnostic and could reflect a range of aeolian processes, although a dominant silt grain size may suggest an overwhelming loess component. Facies 5 and 6 show primary aeolian signatures with the preferred grain orientation being evidence of reworking in an aqueous setting (e.g., lake, stream). These six facies types represent a spectrum of depositional processes that occurred in response to erg migration and climatic changes along this Early Jurassic erg margin. Their facies diversity is evidence for: (1) dry and windy conditions in SW Gondwana during the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, and (2) reworking of the aeolian sediments in various fluvial and lacustrine settings during the development of one of the largest known sand seas in Earth's history.					; Bordy, Emese/JPW-9200-2023; Bordy, Emese M/J-1361-2016	Head, Howard/0000-0002-4808-7104; Bordy, Emese M/0000-0003-4699-0823													0072-1050	1099-1034				MAY	2023	58	5					1822	1843		10.1002/gj.4695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gj.4695		MAR 2023											WOS:000942275700001

Novel methods for monitoring low chlorophyll-a concentrations in the large, oligotrophic Lake Malawi/Nyasa/Niassa	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The use of remote sensing for monitoring chlorophyll-a (chla) and modelling eutrophication has advanced over the last decades. Although the application of the technology has proven successful in ocean ecosystems, there is a need to monitor chla concentrations in large, nutrient-poor inland water bodies. The main objective of this study was to explore the utility of publicly available remotely sensed Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to quantify chla concentrations in the nutrient-deficient Lake Malawi/Niassa/Nyasa (LMNN). A secondary objective was to compare the S2 derived chla with the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) chla product that provides uninterrupted data throughout the year. In situ chla data (n = 76) from upper, middle and lower sections of LMNN served as a reference to produce remote sensing-based quantification. The line-height approach method built on color index, was applied for chla concentrations below 0.25 mg/m3. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 3-band Ocean Color (MODIS-OC3) - was adopted when chla concentration exceeded 0.35 mg/m3. The MODIS-OC3 algorithm had generic model coefficients that were calibrated for each in situ sample by using GCOM-C Level 3 chla product. A weighted sum of the two algorithms was applied for chla concentrations that fell between 0.25 and 0.35 mg/m3. The above methods were then applied to the S2 data to estimate chla at each pixel. S2 showed a promising accuracy in distinguishing chla levels (MSE = 0.18) although the chla range in the lake was relatively narrow, particularly using the locally calibrated coefficients of the OC3 algorithm. Chla distribution maps produced from the S2 data revealed limited spatial variation across the LMNN with higher concentrations identified in the coastal areas. S2-derived chla and GCOM-C chla comparison showed fairly good similarity between the two datasets (MSE = 0.205). Accepting this similarity, monthly chla dynamics of the lake was profiled using the temporally reliable GCOM-C data that showed oligotrophic conditions (1.7 mg/m3 to 3.2 mg/m3) in most parts of the lake throughout the year. The study's findings advance the potential for both remote sensing approaches to provide vital information at the required spatial and temporal resolution for evidencebased policymaking and proactive environmental management in an otherwise very data deficient region.

Diamonds from the Kaapvaal are dominated by resorbed, dodecahedral shapes, coats are absent and yellow colours are common. The first two features suggest exposure to oxidizing fluids/melts during mantle storage and/or transport to the Earth's surface, for the Kaapvaal diamond population. Comparing peridotitic inclusions in diamonds from the central and southern Slave (Panda, DO27 and Snap Lake kimberlites) and the KaapvaaI indicates that the diamondiferous mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave is chemically less depleted. Most notable are the almost complete absence of garnet inclusions derived from low-Ca harzburgites and a generally lower Mg-number of Slave inclusions. Geothermobarometric calculations suggest that Slave diamonds originally formed at very similar thermal conditions as observed beneath the Kaapvaal (geothermal gradients corresponding to 40-42 mW/m(2) surface heat flow), but the diamond source regions subsequently cooled by about 100-150 degreesC to fall on a 37-38 mW/m(2) (surface heat flow) conductive geotherm, as is evidenced from touching (re-equilibrated) inclusions in diamonds, and from xenocrysts and xenoliths. In the Kaapvaal, a similar thermal evolution has previously been recognized for diamonds from the De Beers Pool kimberlites. In part very low aggregation levels of nitrogen impurities in Slave diamonds imply that cooling occurred soon after diamond formation. This may relate elevated temperatures during diamond formation to short-lived magmatic perturbations. Generally high Cr-contents of pyrope garnets (inside and outside of diamonds) indicate that the mantle lithosphere beneath the Slave originally formed as a residue of melt extraction at relatively low pressures (within the stability field of spinelperidotites), possibly during the extraction of oceanic crust. After emplacement of this depleted, oceanic mantle lithosphere into the Slave lithosphere during a subduction event, secondary metasomatic enrichment occurred leading to strong re-enrichment of the deeper (>140 km) lithosphere. Because of the extent of this event and the occurrence of lower mantle diamonds, this may be related to an upwelling plume, but it may equally just reflect a long term evolution with lower mantle diamonds being transported upwards in the course of "normal" mantle convection.

Evaluating middle to late Holocene climate variability from δ 18 O of aquatic invertebrate remains in southwestern Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Holocene paleotemperature records from ice-free margins of Greenland suggest spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the timing of key climate transitions following retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet. However, the paucity of high-resolution climate records from this region limits our understanding of the timing, spatial variation, and drivers of Holocene climate variability. Here, we present a middle to late Holocene climate reconstruction based on delta O-18 of aquatic invertebrate (chironomid and cladoceran) remains and sediment geochemistry from lake sediments to elucidate millennial to submillennial-scale drivers of climate in southwestern Greenland. We establish that our site, Arrowhead Lake, is a through-flowing basin with an integrated signal of annual meteoric water with no evidence of significant evaporative enrichment. Core sediment geochemistry captures the transition from minerogenic-dominated to organic-rich sediments similar to 8 cal ka BP. Chitin-based delta O-18 measurements of both chironomid head capsules and ephippia exhibit similar temporal variability through the record, broadly decreasing from 8.2 cal ka BP to present, concurrent with decreasing summer insolation and regional Neoglacial cooling. A simplified assumption that temperature is the sole driver of changes in isotopes of precipitation yields an estimated average temperature change from the middle to late Holocene at Arrowhead Lake of 2.1-3.0 degrees C, comparable to existing estimates of middle to late Holocene temperature decline in western Greenland. Depleted delta O-18 values after 3.3 cal ka BP correspond to the onset of Neoglacial cooling and independent evidence for a slowdown of the West Greenland Current, and suggests that both temperature and sea-ice variability were important controls on isotopic variability at this site. Highly depleted isotopic values at 8.2 cal ka BP followed by high isotopic variability in the early part of the middle Holocene suggests that our record may capture regional 8.2 ka cooling. This new isotope record provides insight into climate influences during the middle and late Holocene along the western Greenland margin that are important for understanding how ongoing melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet and amplified warming in the Arctic may impact the climate system.					; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014	Edgerton, Briana/0009-0001-0140-6841; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUN 1	2024	333								108664	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108664		APR 2024											WOS:001235608000001
J	Macphail, MK				Macphail, MK			Late neogene climates in Australia: Fossil pollen- and spore-based estimates in retrospect and prospect	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY					Mini-Conference on Australian Palaeoclimates - Refinement of Estimates from Palaeobotanical Data	DEC, 1995	MONASH UNIV, CLAYTON, AUSTRALIA	Palaeobotan & Palynol Assoc Austr	MONASH UNIV			Australian sites that are claimed to preserve evidence of fossil spores and pollen for Late Neogene (Late Miocene, Pliocene) climates, mostly lack one or both of the prerequisites, i.e. accurate dating and continuous preservation of plant microfossils. Nevertheless, the available data confirm that climatic gradients closely parallelled those of the present day in direction although not in strength: broad-scale vegetation successions are ecologically consistent with long-term cooling and (middle to high latitudes) drying trends in global climate. Although it is rarely possible to establish precise meteorological values for the individual sites along these gradients, climatic envelopes can be estimated for many localities. For example, during the Late Miocene-Pliocene, mean annual precipitation along the northern margin appear to range from 600 mm to 1500 mm in the Kimberley region of north-western Western Australia to above 2000-3000 mm on the Atherton Tableland, north-eastern Queensland. If these and other estimates are correct, then environments along the northern margin show only gradual (unidirectional?) change or did not fall below biologically critical thresholds during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but began to approach modem values during Late Pliocene time. Whether the observation implies that meteorological controls at this time were similar to modern synoptic scale systems is unknown. Climates along the southern margin were more labile. For example, there is unequivocal evidence that Early Pliocene climates in the Bass Strait region were effectively more humid and warmer than at present, possibly resembling conditions now found on the northern New South Wales and southern Queensland coast. This phase was preceded (weak evidence) and succeeded (strong evidence) by less temperate conditions during the Late Miocene and Late Pliocene respectively. Forcing factors appear to include changes in relative sea level, orographic effects and, speculatively, remote events such as the isolation and reconnection of the Mediterranean Sea to the world ocean. One promising direction for future research is provided by a recently located onshore basin in Western Australia which preserves an extraordinarily long (100 m), detailed sequence of Late Neogene palynofloras.

Holocene glacier fluctuations and migration of Neolithic yak pastoralists into the high valleys of northwest Bhutan	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Here we present geomorphologic, palaeoenvironmental and archaeo-botanical data which elucidate the Late Pleistocene and Holocene glacial history of the high, mountain-locked Himalayan valleys in northwest Bhutan and provide one of the earliest proofs of human activity yet known for the High Himalaya range. In this area, difficult to access, close linkage between climatic change, glacier fluctuations and human migration patterns has been discovered. Glacier systems in the studied area are characterized by avalanching and debris mantled glacier snouts, with the significant local influence of the Indian summer monsoon causing decoupling of glacier responses from temperature changes but supporting the idea of monsoonal forcing. Geomorphologic mapping, together with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating of ice-proximal sediments, has been used to construct a local glacial chronology. Local ice-stream networks developed during the Early Holocene (ca 10,000-9000 a ago) and during the early part of the Mid Holocene (6710 +/- 90-4680 +/- 155 cal a BP) at which times there were ice advances of about 5 km from the modern glacier termini. At such times, the intensity of pro- and periglacial processes would have intensified and ice-clammed lakes were probably common as well, rendering human colonization of the high valleys in northwest Bhutan impossible. An abrupt shift to dry climatic conditions on the Tibetan Plateau between 5000 and 4500 a BP coincided with glacial decay and the onset of morphodynamically stable conditions on the broad valley floors of the high valleys in this part of the Himalaya. Palynological data suggest that the sudden disappearance of juniper and rhododendron pollen, the immediate onset of pollen input from cereals (confirmed by detailed SEM analysis) and a clear pattern of over-grazing, trampling and peat deterioration can be linked to human arrival in the valleys at ca 4280 +/- 130 cal a BP. Extensive charcoal horizons dating to 4745 +/- 250 and 4680 +/- 155 cal a BP are interpreted as evidence for human use of fire and forest clearances and agree spatially and temporally with the pollen-based picture. Charcoal occurrences as old as 6710 +/- 90 cal a BP might be linked to yet earlier exploration of these Himalayan valleys during phases of low glacial activity. We provide an account of the colonization of these high valleys in response to glacial and monsoonal change and argue that the most likely founder societies come from the Tibetan Plateau, where yak and barley based pastoralism and Neolithic settlements are known to have existed since the Mid Holocene.

Some large-scale centennial warming was accompanied by an increase in precipitation owing to the expansion of the monsoon circulation, e.g. rapid warming during the period from 8.5 to 8.3 ka B.P. and was reflected in the high level of some inland lakes and the sudden expansion of vegetation in pollen diagrams. The growth of the Neolithic culture with agriculture and settlement in the present semi-arid area of Northwest China was undoubtedly related to the dramatic warming and wetting before 8 ka B.P. According to the proxy data of palynological studies, the deviation of annual mean temperature from today's about 7-6 ka B.P. was roughly estimated at about 1-degrees-C in South China, 2-degrees-C in the Changjiang (Yangtze) Valley, 3-degrees-C in North China and Northeast China. The strongest warming by 4-5-degrees-C was recorded in Oinghai-Xizang (Tibet) Plateau. The winter temperature rise was much greater than the annual average temperature. In the eastern half of China, the vegetation zones are mainly parallel to the latitude. During the climax of the Holocene warm period, the northern limit of the tropical monsoonal rain forest shifted less than 1-degrees of latitude northward, the subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest about 1-degrees of latitude, the north subtropical deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved mixed forest about 3-degrees of latitude in the coastal area but only 1-1.5-degrees of latitude in mid-West China and the warm temperate deciduous forest moved 4-degrees of latitude northward, greatly expanding its distribution. Further north, the cool temperate boreal forest withdrew from its southern boundary by about 2-degrees of latitude. Global climatic warming in the mid-Holocene resulted in a sea-level rise. During the period from 6 to 5 ka BP. the sea-level was about 1-3 m higher than the present level. Large area of coastal lowland was submerged by sea water and frequency of occurrence of storm surges also increased during the high sea-level period.

J	Kullman, L				Kullman, L			Non-analogous tree flora in the Scandes Mountains, Sweden, during the early Holocene - macrofossil evidence of rapid geographic spread and response to palaeoclimate	BOREAS												Early-Holocene occurrences of broad-leaved temperate tree species at a site now within the subalpine bell of the Swedish Scandes are reported and analysed. Macrofossil remains (fruits and leaves) of Alnus glutinosa, Corylus avellana, Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra were recovered in a peal deposit far beyond and above their modern distributional limits. A previous nearby finding of Tilia cordata adds to this group of Hemiboreal lowland species, the regional presence of which in high-elevation northern Scandinavia has gone entirely unrecognized by pollen stratigraphical studies. Radiocarbon dates (AMS) range between 8500 and 8000 BP, indicating early and rapid spread, closely following the ice recession. Maximum tree species richness and distributional limits (latitude and altitude) were attained during the earliest part of the Holocene. In a regional perspective, the temperate trees coexisted with a dominant boreal (cold-climate) element, viz. Pinus sylvestris, Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa, Betula pendula, Alnus incana, Picea abies and Larix sibirica, which are all identified and dated From macrofossils. This climatically seemingly incompatible assemblage is without modern analogues. Presumably, this diverse tree flora owed its existence to a unique (Holocene perspective) climatic regime, ultimately forced by the Milankovitch cycles of insolation. The results strengthen previous palaeoclimatic inferences based on past tree-limit positions (Pinus sylvestris) and imply that Holocene summer warmth peaked fairly soon after the regional deglaciation, practically concurrently with the solar radiation maximum. Important questions are raised concerning several palynologically derived postulates within general palaeobiogeography. For example, rates of geographic tree spread are not necessarily individualistic; despite fundamentally different dispersal modes. The emergent efficiency of dispersal suggests that distribution patterns relate to climate and soil factors rather than time. Dispersal steps may have been fairly large, and the resultant geographic spread was epidemic, resulting in a sparse pattern of outlying stands, rather than sequentially following certain routes in the landscape. Rapid geographic expansion is likely to have been relatively unrestrained by physical barriers, e.g. mountain ranges, seas and large lakes. Even in Central Europe, close to the ice margin, there map have been more trees during the latest glaciation than previously realized.																			0300-9483					SEP	1998	27	3					153	161		10.1111/j.1502-3885.1998.tb00875.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.1998.tb00875.x													WOS:000076550900001
J	COBLE, DW				COBLE, DW			WHITE SUCKER POPULATION OF SOUTH BAY LAKE HURON AND EFFECTS OF SEA LAMPREY ON IT	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Information on ecology and dynamics of white suckers, Catostomus commersoni (Lacepede), in South Bay, Lake Huron, was obtained from experimental fishing over more than a decade and from a tagging program in 1955 and 1956. (A total of 1667 suckers were tagged and 8% of them were subsequently recovered.) The fish moved about extensively in the bay, minimal distance travelled averaging 3.8 km during a summer. Nevertheless, it was necessary to divide the bay into discrete fishing areas for calculating population and mortality estimates. The length-weight relationship of adult suckers in June was W = 5.883 x 10-4 l2.92262, where W is weight in pounds and L is fork length in inches. Growth averaged only about 7.6 mm/year, and an annulus was not formed on the scales every year. In 1956 the population may have amounted to about 160,000 adult white suckers, or 23 fish/ha.of 17.5 kg/ha., for the part of the bay less than 36 m deep. The exploitation rate appeared to be less than 2%. The annual survival rate of suckers larger than approximately 38 cm appeared to be about 70-75% decreasing with size of fish. Although it is not known if the size of the population has changed, the size composition changed between 1953 and 1964 through the loss of larger fish. Marked changes in the fauna of South Bay subsequent to the late 1940''s include the invasion of the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus Linnaeus, and the alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus (Wilson), the disappearance of the lake trout, Salvellnus namaycush (walbaum). and the decline of the population of the Cisco, Coregonus (= Leuclchthys) artedil LeSueur. The loss of the larger fish in the white sucker population was probably caused by the sea lamprey, for it occurred after the destruction of the lake trout population and corresponded with increased incidence of lamprey scarring of suckers.																									1967	24	10					2117	+		10.1139/f67-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-173													WOS:A1967A007600006
J	WEIRICH, RT; SCHWARTZ, HL; OPPENHEIMER, JH				WEIRICH, RT; SCHWARTZ, HL; OPPENHEIMER, JH			AN ANALYSIS OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF NUCLEAR AND PLASMA TRIIODOTHYRONINE IN THE SEA LAMPREY, LAKE TROUT, AND RAT - EVOLUTIONARY CONSIDERATIONS	ENDOCRINOLOGY												We have studied the interrelationship of plasma and hepatic nuclear T3 in two lower vertebrates, lake trout and sea lamprey. Specific nuclear T3-binding sites were observed in liver of both species. Binding affinities for T3 and several analogs in lamprey and trout were similar to those in rat liver. The findings of identical sedimentation coefficients, Stokes radii, and mol wt suggest a high degree of homology of the receptor molecule among these species. In lamprey ammocoete, both total (.apprx. 26 nM) and free (.apprx. 0.12 nM) T3 concentrations were 7- to 36-fold higher than in the trout or rat. The concentration of free T4 was 4 times greater than that in rat plasma despite somewhat lower total T4 levels. This resulted from a 6 times lesser binding of T4 by ammocoete plasma. Total and free T3 and T4 levels fell sharply during transformation to the adult form. In trout, a 27 times greater concentration of free T3 in hepatic nuclei than in cytosol, previously documented for rat liver, gave evidence of the early evolution of an active transport process between these compartments. Analysis of [125I]T3 interchange in trout indicated the existence of two kinetically distinct compartments within the liver, an outer compartment in rapid equilibrium with plasma, and a slowly equilibrating compartment decaying with a T1/2 of 3.7 h. T3 associated with the nuclear receptor appeared to be in equilibrium with the slower hepatic compartment. Despite the apparent resemblance of T3 receptors in these species to those in the rat, administration of T3 (200 .mu.g/100 g BW for 4 days) to trout caused no increase in hepatic oxygen consumption or the activities of malic enzyme or .alpha.-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. Further, such treatment produced no consistent changes in hepatic mRNA activity profiles analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis of in vitro translational products. As suggested by the high free T3 concentration in the larval lamprey ammocoete, T3 in early vertebrates may have a primarily developmental function, manifested over a restricted time frame.																			0013-7227	1945-7170				FEB	1987	120	2					664	677		10.1210/endo-120-2-664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/endo-120-2-664								3803297					WOS:A1987F825100032
J	Knösche, R				Knösche, R			Organic sediment nutrient concentrations and their relationship with the hydrological connectivity of floodplain waters (River Havel, NE Germany)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Investigations on large canalised rivers, for example the Danube, have shown that transported particulate matter, which is typically inorganic, is predominantly deposited in waters near the river's main channel. This investigation deals with the lower section of the River Havel (NE Germany), a canalised lowland river with a very flat floodplain. This river is highly polluted by nutrients from urban areas (Berlin) and a long chain of river lakes produces high concentrations of phytoplankton. Due to the high proportion of planktogenic detritus, it was hypothesised that greater quantities of nutrient-rich fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) would be deposited in floodplain waters located further from the main channel than has been reported for large rivers. The total nutrient, P-binding metal (Fe, Al, and Mn), organic and inorganic carbon (TOC, TIC) contents of the upper organic sediment layer (0-4 cm) were analysed in samples collected from 48 floodplain water and river sites. The sediment bulk density, calculated on the basis of dry mass content and loss on ignition, was used to characterise the waters according to the impact of the river current. The results showed that the variability of total phosphorus (TP) was best explained by the variability of total iron (TFe, R-2 = 0.52). The floodplain water sediments could clearly be separated into two groups on the basis of the sediment particle size composition, and of the element ratios TOC:TP, TN:TP, primarily TFe:TP. The sediments from impounded river sections and from mouth sections of backwaters (approx. 100-200 m) were characterised by a high proportion particles from the 0.1 to 0.5 mm size fraction and by homogeneous, low TFe:TP, TOC:TP and TN:TP ratios. Sediments from distal sections of backwaters and of oxbow lakes tended to exhibit high element ratios with much higher variability. These results were interpreted as a spatially limited impact of the river on the floodplain water sediments. Contrary to expectation, the phosphorus bound in river seston was predominantly and very homogeneously deposited in the impounded river and mouth sections of backwaters. This implies that the inundation of the floodplain waters during spring floods seems to have no important material impact on the sediments in waters of low hydrological connectivity with the River Havel.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2006	560						63	76		10.1007/s10750-005-0983-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0983-x													WOS:000236092500006

From May to September 1993 a dense population of the signal crayfish was studied in eight earthen ponds teach with an area of 120 m(2)). Populations in four ponds were fed a pellet diet while crayfish in four ponds were kept as unfed controls. During summer 1995, we investigated growth and survival of noble crayfish in artificial outdoor ponds teach with an area of 50 m(2)). We had four treatments with age 2+ males, each replicated three times: unfed controls (10 crayfish/m(2), crayfish fed the pellet diet(10 crayfish/m(2) and 20 crayfish/m(2) and ii treatment where crayfish were fed fish (10 crayfish/m(2). Capture-recapture data showed that the growth of adult P. leniusculus males (marked in May and recaptured in August) receiving additional food (mean carapace increase 7.5 mm) was greater in comparison with unfed crayfish (mean carapace increase 3.8 mm). Daytime activity for unfed was significantly higher than for fed crayfish. The percentage of mature females in September differed between treatments. The mean percentage of mature females in ponds with fed crayfish (234 females investigated) was 82.4% of ail females, whereas only 51.1% were mature among the unfed crayfish (210 females). Survival of unfed A. astacus was 75%, significantly lower than the survival of fed crayfish (96%). The weight increase of the surviving cray[ish was lower for the unfed (28%) compared to fed crayfish (37%). Density did not effect survival or weight increase, i. e. there were no differences between the two treatments with crayfish that were fed the pellet diet,																					0-9642382-3-3				1997							170	181																WOS:000090095400016

The annual average pH of the reference basin remained near 6-1. As part of a comprehensive programme to determine the chemical and biological responses to acidification, minor metals (Al, Fe, Mn) and trace metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) in lake water (0.4-mu-m pore filtered samples), periphyton, zooplankton, and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were measured. At pH 5.6, dissolved Mn and Fe increased in the acidified basin. At pH 5.1 and 4.7, dissolved Al, Fe, Mn, Cd and Zn were elevated in the acidified basin. At pH 4.7, dissolved Pb in the acidified basin became elevated over reference basin levels. Dissolved Cu remained similar in both basins down to pH 4.7. Cd burdens in periphyton collected on artificial substrates were lower in the treatment basin at pH 5.1 (1.8-mu-g g-1 dry wt.) than in the reference basin at pH 6.1 (7.5-mu-g g-1 dry wt.), but Al and Fe burdens in periphyton were similar in both basins. Likewise, Cd levels in muscle tissue of perch from the treatment basin at pH 4.7 were lower (26 ng g-1 dry wt.) than in the reference basin at pH 6.1 (36 ng g-1 dry wt.); Al and Fe burdens were similar in perch muscle tissue from both basins. Levels of Cd and Fe in zooplankton from the acidified basin at pH 4.7 were is-approximately-equal-to 2x higher than in animals from the reference basin. In both basins of the lake, Al and Cd levels in lake biota decreased with increasing trophic level, demonstrating that food chain biomagnification does not occur for these metals.

M.; Macias-Fauria, Marc			What evidence exists for temporal variability in Arctic terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity throughout the Holocene? A systematic map protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE												Background: The Arctic tundra is subject to the greatest climate change-induced temperature rises of any biome. Both terrestrial and freshwater biota are responding to recent climate warming through variability in their distribution, abundance, and richness. However, uncertainty arises within models of future change when considering processes that operate over centennial timescales. A systematic evidence synthesis of centennial-scale variability in biodiversity does not currently exist for the Arctic biome. Here, we sought to address the primary research question: what evidence exists for temporal variability in Arctic terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity throughout the Holocene (11,650 years before present (yBP)-OyBP)? Methods: Consultation with stakeholders informed key definitions, scoping and the appropriateness of the research question. The research question was structured using a PECO framework-Arctic biota (P), a timestamped year in the Holocene (E), another year in the Holocene (C), and the dimensions of biodiversity that have been measured (O)-to inform the search strategy. Search strings were benchmarked against a test list of 100 known sources to ensure a specific and comprehensive return of literature. Searches will occur across 13 bibliographic databases. The eligibility criteria specify that sources must: (a) use 'proxy' methods to measure biodiversity; (b) fall within the spatial extent of the contemporary Arctic tundra biome; and (c) consist of a time-series that overlaps with 11,650yBP to OyBP (1950AD). Information coded from studies will include proxy-specific information to account for both temporal uncertainty (i.e., the characteristics of age-depth models and dating methods) and taxonomic uncertainty (i.e., the samples and processes used for taxonomic identification).

An evaluation Zequanox® efficacy and application strategies for targeted control of zebra mussels in shallow-water habitats in lakes	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												An evaluation of Zequanox (R) (a naturally derived biopesticide that is non-toxic to humans and other aquatic life and selectively kills dreissenid mussels) for controlling zebra mussel infestations in shallow-water habitats in lakes was conducted at Deep Quarry Lake in DuPage County, Illinois during summer 2012 and 2013. During the 2012 trial, three sets of paired 24-m(2) treatment and control sites were established within the lake, while a single 324-m(2) treatment site was established for the 2013 trial. Zequanox was applied to treatment plots, contained using PVC barrier curtains, and barriers were removed during the morning following application. Zebra mussel mortality and size distributions on natural substrates were assessed one day and one week post-treatment for 2012 trials and one day and two weeks post-treatment for 2013 trials; percent mortality of zebra mussels in mesh containers in treatment and control sites was also monitored up to 14 days and 48 days post-treatment in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Several water quality parameters were measured in control and treatment plots before and during application and up to 14 d post-treatment. Mean percent mortality for adult zebra mussels on natural and artificial substrates in treatment locations 7-48 d following Zequanox application ranged from 92-98% during both years, while mortality was consistently <= 10% in control locations. Mean percent mortality ranged from 15-76% in locations > 5 m from and in water shallower than Zequanox application points (<0.6 m depth) during the 2013 trial likely due to limited product dispersal into these areas. There was no significant difference in the size distribution of live and dead zebra mussels in treatment plots. Mean veliger mortality was 94.4% 20-h after the start of the 6-h Zequanox treatment period in the treatment area compared to 15.1% in untreated locations during the 2013 trial. Temporary but substantial reductions in dissolved oxygen were observed in treatment locations during the morning following Zequanox treatment in both 2012 and 2013 trials, likely due to the presence of the barriers that prevented well-oxygenated water from circulating into treatment zones from adjacent areas in the lake. Dissolved oxygen concentrations quickly rebounded to levels consistent with control sites upon removal of barriers. No effects of Zequanox treatment on ammonia, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, pH, or conductivity were observed. Results suggest that Zequanox has potential as a tool for controlling zebra mussels in shallow-water habitats in lakes without significant long-term effects on water quality.

J	Stokes, CR; Clark, CD				Stokes, CR; Clark, CD			Evolution of late glacial ice-marginal lakes on the northwestern Canadian Shield and their influence on the location of the Dubawnt Lake palaeo-ice stream	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During deglaciation of the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet large proglacial lakes developed in positions where proglacial drainage was impeded by the ice margin. For some of these lakes, it is known that subsequent drainage had an abrupt and widespread impact on North Atlantic Ocean circulation and climate, but less is known about the impact that the lakes exerted on ice sheet dynamics. This paper reports palaeogeographic reconstructions of the evolution of proglacial lakes during deglaciation across the northwestern Canadian Shield, covering an area in excess of 1,000,000 km(2) as the ice sheet retreated some 600 km. The interactions between proglacial lakes and ice sheet flow are explored, with a particular emphasis on whether the disposition of lakes may have influenced the location of the Dubawnt Lake ice stream. This ice stream falls outside the existing paradigm for ice streams in the Laurentide Ice Sheet because it did not operate over fined-grained till or lie in a topographic trough. Ice margin positions and a digital elevation model are utilised to predict the geometry and depth of proglacial takes impounded at the margin at 30-km increments during deglaciation. Palaeogeographic reconstructions match well with previous independent estimates of lake coverage inferred from field evidence, and results suggest that the development of a deep lake in the Thelon drainage basin may have been influential in initiating the ice stream by inducing calving, drawing down ice and triggering fast ice flow. This is the only location alongside this sector of the ice sheet where large (>3000 km(2)), deep lakes (similar to120 m) are impounded for a significant length of time and exactly matches the location of the ice stream. It is speculated that the commencement of calving at the ice sheet margin may have taken the system beyond a threshold and was sufficient to trigger rapid motion but that once initiated, calving processes and losses were insignificant to the functioning of the ice stream. It is thus concluded that proglacial lakes are likely to have been an important control on ice sheet dynamics during deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, uncertainties in Greenland's contribution to future sea level rise remain, partly due to challenges in constraining the role of ice dynamics. Transient ice accelerations, or ice speed-up events, lasting from 1 d to 1 week, have the potential to indirectly affect the mass budget of the ice sheet. They are triggered by an overload of the subglacial drainage system due to an increase in water supply. In this study, we identify melt-induced ice speed-up events at the Russell Glacier, southwest Greenland, in order to analyse synoptic patterns driving these events. The short-term speed-up events are identified from daily ice velocity time series collected from six GPS stations along the glacier for each summer (May-October) from 2009 to 2012. In total, 45 ice speed-up events are identified, of which we focus on the 36 melt-induced events, where melt is derived from two in situ observational datasets and one regional climate model forced by ERA5 reanalysis. We identify two additional potential water sources, namely lake drainages and extreme rainfall, which occur during 14 and 4 out of the 36 melt-induced events, respectively. The 36 melt-induced speed-up events occur during synoptic patterns that can be grouped into three main clusters: (1) patterns that resemble atmospheric rivers with a landfall in southwest Greenland, (2) patterns with anticyclonic blocking centred over southwest Greenland, and (3) patterns that show low-pressure systems centred either south or southeast of Greenland. Out of these clusters, the one resembling atmospheric river patterns is linked to the strongest speed-up events induced by 2 to 3 d continuously increasing surface melt driven by anomalously high sensible heat flux and incoming longwave radiation. In the other two clusters, the net shortwave radiation dominates the contribution to the melt energy. As the frequency and intensity of these weather patterns may change in the warming climate, so may the frequency and intensity of ice speed-up events, ultimately altering the mass loss of the ice sheet.					; Tedstone, Andrew/B-3573-2019; Lea, James/N-5699-2015	Schmid, Timo/0000-0002-6788-2154; Tedstone, Andrew/0000-0002-9211-451X; Brough, Stephen/0000-0002-6581-6081; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				SEP 13	2023	17	9					3933	3954		10.5194/tc-17-3933-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3933-2023													WOS:001161765300001

ESTIMATION THE FACTORS AFFECTING ON GROWTH OF ALGAE IN UM EL-NAAJ LAKE BY USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES	PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA												Epiphytic algae adherent to aquatic plants are an essential link in the composition of the food chain of any ecosystem. Epiphytic algae act as primary producers of the food chain in the aquatic ecosystem and as natural food for herbivorous zooplankton and fish. This study aimed to detect the presence of algae colonies through remote sensing and to analyze factors that affect the growth of algae through field survey and visual interpretation of satellite images in Lake Um El-Naaj. Samples were collected from six locations on Lake Um El-Naaj from November 2018 to June 2019. The algae samples were collected from submerged parts of emerging aquatic plants (aquatic macrophytes Phragmites australis) and stored in plastic bags with little ambient water and solutions for preservation in the field and the laboratory. Water samples were collected to study the nutritional factors that influence the growth of algae, including the concentration of Phosphate, Nitrate, and Silica (silicon dioxide). The results showed that the values of total phosphorus increased by 1.0, 0.9, and 0.8 mg/L, in January, in places 2, 5, and 6, respectively. The highest nitrate value was 11.2 mg/L in December at site 5, while the lowest concentration values were in November (2.2 mg/L at site 6 and 3.7 mg/L at site 4). Besides, the lowest silicate concentration was 0.4 mg/L in November at site 2, while the highest was 2.4 mg/L in June 2019 at site 6. Based on the findings, it is possible to conclude that, during the winter, the water level increased due to the rain. For this reason, nutrient concentrations were low during the last period. Also, with the use of maps and remote sensing techniques, it is possible to determine the expected values around the station's location as future predictive readings that compensate for the difficulty of reaching these areas.

Bed-load transport treated by many engineers marginally or omitted and often receives only minor consideration from engineers or may be entirely disregarded simply because they do not know how to address the issuein many cases, this is a fundamental problem in river management tasks such as: flood protection works; river bank protection works against erosion; building bridges and culverts; building water reservoirs and dams; checking dams and any other hydraulic structures. Thus, to share our experience in our paper, bed-load transport was calculated in two river/stream mountain catchments, which are different in terms of the characteristics of the catchment area and the level of river engineering works performed along the stream channelboth are tributaries of the Dunajec River and have similar Carpathian flysh geology. The studies were performed in the Mlyne stream and in the Lososina River in Polish Carpathians. Mlynne is one of the streams in the Gorce Mountainsit is prone to flash flooding events and has caused many problems with floods in the past. It flows partially in the natural river channel and partially in a trained river channel lined with concrete revetments. The stream bed load is accumulated in the reservoir upstream of the check dam. The Lososina River is one of the Polish Carpathian mountainous streams which crosses the south of the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains. It mostly has a gravel bed and it is flashy and experiences frequent flooding spring. At the mouth of the Lososina River, there is one of the largest Polish Carpathian artificial lakesthe Czchow lake. The Lososina mostly transports gravel as the bed load to the Czchow water reservoir where the sediment is deposited. In the early seventies, the Lososina was partly canalised, especially in places where passes inhabited areas. The paper compares the situation of bed-load transport in the Lososina River before and after engineering training works showing how much sediment is transported downstream along the river channel to the Czchow artificial lake. Also compared is the Mlynne bed load transport upstream and downstream from the check dam showing how much sediment might be transported and deposited in the reservoir upstream from the check dam and when one could expect this reservoir to be clogged.

Palaeoclimate has been reconstructed by a multiproxy approach based on sedimentary environments, periglacial structures and Coleoptera remains. The Weichselian Middle to Late Pleniglacial sequence reveals a change from lacustrine to fluvial deposition. During the Late Pleniglacial, deposition by ephemeral streams with relatively stable channels was abruptly replaced by braided-river deposition. An increased aridity and the disappearance of the vegetation are held reponsible for this change in river style. The increase of aridity in the second part of the Late Pleniglacial has been inferred from the absence of organic material in the braided deposits and the extension of aeolian environments at the expense of the braided environment. A return towards wetter conditions during the Late-glacial has been inferred from lake marl deposition and local fluvial reworking of dunes. Special attention has been given to the climate reconstruction of the early Late Pleniglacial (26-24 ka). Permafrost conditions during this period, in combination with local strong relief and intensive slope processes, resulted in rapid aggradation by ephemeral streams with relatively stable channels. The climate during the early Late Pleniglacial was extremely harsh. The habitat was in many ways analogous to the true tundra of the present-day Arctic. The periglacial features indicate a mean annual air temperature lower than -4 degrees C. The coleopteran assemblage from Betchatow is one of the most cold-adapted faunas so far recorded from Europe. The mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest months were respectively 8 degrees C and -27 degrees C. it is concluded that a strong temperature decline, especially of the winter temperature, occurred at the transition from the Middle to the Late Pleniglacial. At the onset of the Late-glacial Younger Dryas period a cooling of the climate has been inferred from the presence of small ice-wedge casts at the base of overlying dune sands. A mean annual air temperature between -2 and -5 degrees C is postulated. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

C	Hua, L; You, AJ; Han, ZC; Xu, HB			IOP	Hua, Lei; You, Aiju; Han, Zengcui; Xu, Haibo			Simulation analysis of the influence of heavy rainfall on urban lake	THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				3rd International Conference on Energy Engineering and Environmental Protection (EEEP)	NOV 19-21, 2018	Sanya, PEOPLES R CHINA					Urban lakes play a role in flood control and storage, they are also important urban landscape, which have certain requirements for water quality. In addition to the impact on the lake water quantity, the short-term heavy rainfall runoff carries a large pollution and has a great impact on the water quality, especially for urban lakes with relatively small reserves. However, there are few studies on the effects of heavy rainfall on lake hydrodynamics and water quality. In this paper, taking the rainfall of typhoon Fitow as an example, EFDC was used to simulate the hydrodynamic water quality process of West Lake in Hangzhou China during the Fitow period, the water level and water quality monitoring values were used to validate the model during this period. The simulation shows that the heavy rainfall had a great influence on the water level of the West Lake. Water level of West Lake crossed warning mark about 71 hours, with Sudi and Baidi Causeways were flooded about 57 hours. According to the simulation, as the TP concentration of early runoff was high, the TP concentration at the inlets of each sub-basin increased above 0.1 mg/L. After the early runoff, the TP concentration at the inlets began to decrease. The high concentration area gradually migrated to the downstream, and decreased gradually until it was discharged from the Shengtangzha Outlet, and water quality gradually returned to normal. Since the water level of West Lake increased significantly during the period, the influence of different drainage discharges was analyzed. The analysis shows that the highest water level of West Lake during Fitow period would fall below warning mark in case of increasing the flood discharge capacity to 46.8m(3)/s, which was 29m(3)/s more than current discharge. Otherwise there's little effect on the spatial distribution of TP with the increasing of flood discharge. In conclusion, the main threat of short-term heavy rainfall to urban lake is flood control and drainage, meanwhile the impact of the heavy rain on water quality cannot be ignored. A perfect drainage and diversion system would make the water quality back to normal quickly after the heavy rainfall.																			1755-1307						2019	227								052040	10.1088/1755-1315/227/5/052040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/227/5/052040													WOS:000471098400182

Chlorophylls and carotenoids were analysed by HPLC in suspended and settling matter and in the surface sediment of the central south basin (c. 1400-m water depth). Sedimentation rates of dry matter, organic carbon and nitrogen were also determined. The flux of particulate matter in 40 in, directly below the euphotic zone, amounted to 14.9 g m(-2) month(-1) with a carbon content of 21.9%, and an atomic C/N ratio of 14.8. The pigment flux was 12.1 mu mol m(-2) month(-1) chlorophyll a, 40.8 mu mol m(-2) month(-1) pheophorbide a, 6.5 mu mol m(-2) month(-1) pheophytin a, 2.1 mu mol m(-2) month(-1) chlorophyllide a, and 0.3 mu mol m(-2) month(-1) pyropheophytin a. The decay during sedimentation can be described by two-exponential or decay regression models for organic carbon, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, pheophorbide a, chlorophyllide a, chlorophyll b, and most carotenoids, but not for pheophytin a, pheophytin b, and pyropheophytin a. The two-phase character of the models outlined that, for the former components, the flux diminished strongly in a first phase down to 250-m water depth and remained rather stable below 250 m. The chlorophyll a/carbon ratio also decreased with depth, whereas the pheophytin a/carbon ratio and the pyropheophytin a/carbon ratio increased with depth. From chlorophyll a, plus its degradation products, 28% reached the lake bottom when compared to the sedimentation below the euphotic zone. Based on the marker pigments fucoxanthin, chlorophyll b, and zeaxanthin, the contribution of the main phytoplankton groups to the settled chlorophyll a was estimated as 87% Bacillariophyceae+Chrysophyceac, 11% Chlorophyta, and 2% cyanobacterial picoplankton. These relationships changed only little during the sedimentation through the whole water column, but diverged from compositions calculated for the summer standing crop. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Highman, TA; Shakoor, A				Highman, TA; Shakoor, A			Role of soil joints in causing bluff erosion along the Lake Erie shoreline, northeast Ohio	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Bluff erosion along the Lake Erie shoreline in Ohio is a major environmental problem causing extensive damage to homes, agricultural land, and lakeshore roads. The most extensive erosion takes place in areas where the bluffs are made of well-jointed, overconsolidated, glacial till material (CL; ML-CL) that is overlain by lacustrine silts (ML) or silty clays (CL). In order to investigate the effect of soil joints on bluff erosion, four sites, all characterized by the presence of well-developed joints, were selected between Painesville, Ohio, and the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The detailed line survey technique was used to measure orientations and other aspects (continuity, spacing, surface features, aperture, nature of infilling material, presence or absence of mater) of the joints at the four sites. Erosion rates were monitored on a bi-weekly basis for a period of one year, using equally spaced pegs on the bluff face. Photographs were taken frequently to aid in monitoring of bluff erosion. Results indicate that bluff erosion in the study area is greatly influenced by the presence of joints in the glacial till. The joints enhance erosion by providing pathways for mater movement in both horizontal and vertical directions which, in turn, leads to widening of the joint openings and piping of the overlying silty material. The buildup of pore pressure along the joints, after a prolonged rainfall or a sudden snowmelt, also contributes to bluff instability In the toe area, wave attack results in the formation of notches, cavities, and concave zones. Erosion at the bluff toe, accelerated by soil joints, initiates block falls and planar slides along the pre-existing joint surfaces above the toe area. The slump and flow type failures that occur in the overlying lacustrine material are a consequence of the joint-promoted failures in the underlying till. Thus, any remedial measures that are undertaken to minimize bluff erosion along Lake Erie must take into account the effect of soil joints.

This cycle consisted of discrete phases of activity associated with a range of geophysical and geochemical signatures that illustrate the relative value of the various techniques for identifying precursory phenomena. intrusive episodes in 1980 and 1986-1989 at Poas were preceded by A-type seismicity. Magma rose close to the surface on both occasions but the focus shifted from the dome (1980), when the lake remained stable, to the crater lake (1986-1989). The 1986-1989 event, which culminated in the complete loss of the crater lake and explosive eruptions, was characterised by concurrent increases in micro-gravity (on the southern crater floor), B-type seismicity and lake temperature and by changes in lake geochemistry. The calculated mass of magma intruded in this period is far too small to account for the observed increase in surface heat flux and subsequent loss of the lake; we suggest that a series of magma-filled dendritic conduits intruded beneath the lake facilitated enhanced heat and gas flux from a deeper magma feeder body. A model is envisaged where brittle fracture of the magma carapace at about 500 m depth allows magma to rise up through the conduit system beneath the crater and to fall again or solidify in situ when pressure drops. Whilst active, this process transfers heat and gas upwards driven by the convection of buoyant, volatile-rich magma displacing colder, relatively Volatile-poor magma. As magma pressure from below decreases, the link between the deeper magma feeder and the upper conduit system is broken and the hydrothermal system resumes its role of cooling the magma feeder. The role of the lake as a physical and chemical buffer to the volcanic system was clearly demonstrated when its disappearance in 1989 was accompanied by enhanced eruptive activity and gas emissions with considerable local environmental impact. The lake therefore acts as both a moderator and index of volcanic processes at Poas. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, MY; Yang, H; Zheng, Z; Tian, LP				Wang, Mengyuan; Yang, Huan; Zheng, Zhuo; Tian, Liping			Altitudinal climatic index changes in subtropical China indicated from branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers proxies	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) have been widely applied in climate parameter reconstructions over the past few years. MBT'(5ME) (the methylation of branched tetraethers based on the 5-methyl isomers) and CBT' (cyclisation of branched tetraethers that includes 6-methyl brGDGTs in the numerator) have proven to be useful brGDGT proxies for interpreting the mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH of different climate condition areas in China. However, the application of MBT'(5ME) and CBT' for indicating altitudinal climate conditions is still open to discussion, e.g., the lack of comparisons between attitudinal results from mountain areas of different climate conditions. In this study, we compared soil brGDGT along three mountain transects in subtropical China, i.e., Mt. Gaoligong, Mt. Fanjing and Mt. Shennongjia. The brGDGT distributions of Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing were similar to the subtropical surface soil brGDGT distribution pattern, featured by the dominance of chemical structures of brGDGTs Ia and IIa. However, Mt. Shennongjia was characterised by increasing brGDGTs IIIa', IIa', IIb' and Ib, much like the semi-humid/humid temperate climate area brGDGT distribution pattern. These results indicate that altitudinal climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation could be recorded by varied brGDGT distributions. Also, MBT'(5ME)-inferred MATs were negatively correlated with mountain altitude (R-2: 0.79-0.87). The MAT lapse rate increased from Mt. Shennongjia to Mt. Fanjing to Mt. Gaoligong (0.5 degrees C/100 m, 0.9 degrees C/100 m and 1.3 degrees C/100 m, respectively). The influence of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau ice cover and differences in latitudinal temperature and/or moisture conditions might be the reasons for the various lapse rates. The soil pH was less correlated with altitude (R-2: 0.58-0.63) than to the regression of MAT and altitude, showing slightly different relations from those of horizontal studies. At Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing, soil pH and altitude demonstrated positive linear regressions but with different slopes. The different reducing rate of soil pH as a function of altitude for the two mountains is probably caused by their dominating summer monsoons. For Mt. Shennongjia where the climate condition is less humid than Mt. Gaoligong and Mt. Fanjing, the soil pH did not significantly change with altitude, and thus no relationship was observed. This might probably be partially induced by the weakly alkaline parent rocks of Mt. Shennongjia.

J	Sanders, D; Wischounig, L; Gruber, A; Ostermann, M				Sanders, Diethard; Wischounig, Lukas; Gruber, Alfred; Ostermann, Marc			Inner gorge-slot canyon system produced by repeated stream incision (eastern Alps): Significance for development of bedrock canyons	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Many inner bedrock gorges of the Alps show abrupt downstream changes in gorge width, as well as channel type and gradient, as a result of epigenetic incision of slot canyons. Many slot canyons also are associated with older gorge reaches filled with Quaternary deposits. The age of slot canyons and inner bedrock gorges, however, commonly is difficult to constrain. For the inner-bedrock gorge system of the Steinberger Ache catchment (eastern Alps), active slot canyons as well as older, abandoned gorge reaches filled with upper Wurmian proglacial deposits record three phases of gorge development and slot-canyon incision. A U-234/Th-230 age of cement of 29.7 +/- 1.8 ka in fluvial conglomerates onlapping the flank of an inner gorge fits with late Wurmian valley-bottom aggradation shortly before pleniglacial conditions; in addition, the age indicates that at least the corresponding canyon reach must be older. During advance of ice streams in the buildup of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the catchment was blocked, and a proglacial lake formed. Bedrock gorges submerged in that lake were filled with fluviolacustrine deposits. During the LGM, the entire catchment was overridden by ice. During post-glacial reincision, streams largely found again their preexisting inner bedrock canyons. In some areas, however, the former stream course was 'missed', and a slot canyon formed. The distribution of Pleistocene deposits, the patterns of canyon incision, and the mentioned U/Th cementation age, however, together record a further discrete phase of base-level rise and stream incision well before the LGM. The present course of Steinberger Ache and its tributaries is a patchwork of (1) slot canyons incised during post-glacial incision; (2) vestiges of slot canyons cut upon an earlier (middle to late Wurmian?) cycle of base-level rise and fall; (3) reactivated reaches up to similar to 200 m in width of inner bedrock gorge that are watershed at present, and more than at least similar to 30 ka in age; and (4) abandoned, sediment-filled reaches of bedrock canyons that also must be older than 30 ka and that are exposed alongside the active streams. 'Multi-cyclic' bedrock canyon systems composed of reaches of markedly different ages may be common in mountain ranges subject to glaciations and/or mass wasting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nellis, MD; Harrington, JA; Wu, JP				Nellis, MD; Harrington, JA; Wu, JP			Remote sensing of temporal and spatial variations in pool size, suspended sediment, turbidity, and Secchi depth in Tuttle Creek Reservoir, Kansas: 1993	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Four dates of Landsat Thematic Mapper data from 1993, April 9, July 30, August 15, and September 16, were used to assess temporal and spatial patterns of lake area and dimensions of suspended sediment concentration in Tuttle Creek Reservoir, Kansas. In 1993, excessive precipitation in the Big Blue River Basin, and throughout much of the Upper Middle West, led to widespread flooding. Rains produced substantial erosion, sediment movement down the stream network, and a runoff volume that filled Tuttle Creek Reservoir, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood control structure. The April 9 data are from before the flood, the July 30 data an from the time of maximum pool size and use of the emergency spillway, and the August and September data document the declining pool sizes. Three separate analyses were performed on each of the four dates of Thematic Mapper data. One set of analyses involved applying an existing physical model that uses at-satellite reflectance for TM Band 3 to estimate variations in suspended sediment, turbidity, and Secchi depth throughout the reservoir. Maps of estimated parameters of water quality for the four individual dates were compared and analyzed to document spatial and temporal changes. The second research method involved unsupervised classification (ERDAS ISODATA algorithm) of the data from the Turtle Creek Reservoir. Water areas were grouped into coherent classes for further spatial analysis using a two-step or layered classification procedure for each date. The third analysis used a GIS overlay technique to compare the area of the water surface for each of the four dates with the flood pool as marked on U.S.G.S. 7-1/2 minute quadrangles. Comparisons document the major change in lake area between April and July, the high levels of suspended sediment in mid-summer, and the decline in pool size and concentrations of suspended sediment by mid-September. The study illustrates the advantages of using remote sensing to assist in documenting a relatively short-term environmental hazard. This study also demonstrates the value of Landsat Thematic Mapper data for use in mapping geographic variations in water area and quality in conjunction with a major flood event.

The last Toba super eruptions were recorded around 73 ka and produced the Youngest Toba Tuff about 2,800 km3. Since then, there is no record of significant volcanic seismicity at Toba Volcanic Complex (TVC). However, the hydrothermal activities are still on going as presented by the existence of hot springs and alteration zones at the northwest caldera. The hydrothermal fluids probably containing some chemical compositions mixed with surficial water pollutant and contaminated the Toba Lake. Therefore, an environmental issues related to the existence of chemical composition and degradation of water clearness in the lake had been raised in the local community. The pollutant sources are debatable between natural and anthropogenic influences because some human activities grow rapidly at and around the lake such as hotels, tourisms, husbandry, aquaculture, as well as urbanization. Therefore, obtaining correct information about the source materials floating at the surface of the Toba Lake is crucial for environmental and hazard mitigation purposes. Overcoming the problem, we presented this paper to assess the source possibility of floating materials at Toba Lake, especially from natural sources such as hydrothermal activities of TVC and river stream sediments. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) techniques using atmospherically corrected of Landsat-8 and colour composite of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) were used to map the distribution of floating materials. The seven ground truth points were used to confirm the correctness of proposed method. Based on the SAM and PolSAR techniques, we could detect the interface of hydrothermal fluid at the lake surfaces. Various distributions of stream sediment were also detected from the river mouth to the lake. The influence possibilities of the upwelling process from the bottom floor of Toba Lake were also discussed in view point magmatism beneath TVC.					; Saepuloh, Asep/ABA-9005-2021	Saepuloh, Asep/0000-0003-4687-3520; 													0094-243X		978-0-7354-1377-1				2016	1730								050009	10.1063/1.4947405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4947405													WOS:000376003700037
J	Blair, TC				Blair, TC			Sedimentology of gravelly Lake Lahontan highstand shoreline deposits, Churchill Butte, Nevada, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Gravelly shoreline deposits of the latest Pleistocene highstand of Lake Lahontan occur in pristine depositional morphology, and are exposed in gravel pits along Churchill Butte in west-central Nevada. Four environments differentiated at this site are alluvial fan/colluvium, lakeshore barrier spit, lake lower-shoreface spit platform, and lake bottom Lakeshore deposits abut, along erosional wave headcuts, either unsorted muddy to bouldery colluvium fringing Churchill Butte bedrock, or matrix-supported, cobbly and pebbly debris-Sow deposits of the Silver Springs fan. The lakeshore barrier spit is dominated by granule pebble gravel concentrated by wave erosion of the colluvial and alluvial-fan facies. The lakeward side of the barrier consists of beachface deposits of well-sorted granules or pebbles in broad, planar beds 1-10 cm thick and sloping 10-15 degrees. They interfinger downslope with thicker (10-25 cm) and less steep (5-10 degrees) lakeward-dipping beds of fine to medium pebble gravel of the lake upper shoreface. Interstratified with the latter are 10-40-cm-thick sets of high-angle cross-beds that dip southward, alongshore. Higher-angle (15-20 degrees), landward-dipping foresets of similar texture but poorer sorting comprise the proximal backshore on the landward side of the barrier. They were deposited during storm surges that over-topped the barrier berm. Gastropod-rich sand and mud, also deposited by storm-induced washover, are found landward of the gravel foresets in a 15-m-wide backshore pond. Algal stromatolites, ostracodes, and diatoms accumulated in this pond between storm events. The lake lower shoreface, extending from water depths of 2 to 8 m, consists of a southward-prograding spit platform built by longshore drift. The key component of this platform is large-scale sandy pebble gravel in 16 degrees southward-dipping 'Gilbert' foresets that grade at a water depth of about 6-7 m to 4 degrees-dipping sandy toesets. A shift from bioturbated lower-shoreface sand and silt, to flat and laminated lake-bottom silt and mud, occurs between water depths of 10-40 m and over a shore-normal distance of greater than or equal to 250 m. This lake-bottom mud facies, unlike the others, is areally expansive. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

S	Sylvestre, F		Vimeux, F; Sylvestre, F; Khodri, M		Sylvestre, Florence			Moisture Pattern During the Last Glacial Maximum in South America	PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN SOUTH AMERICA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS: FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM TO THE HOLOCENE	Developments in Paleoenvironmental Research											The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is still an exciting period of time for investigating ecosystem responses to climate changes since it corresponds to a steady state in a glacial world with maximum global expansion of ice-sheets, CO2 concentrations half those of today, temperatures up to 5 degrees C cooler in the tropical lowlands, and precipitation regimes differed from today. South America is an ideal place to study these changes since climatic conditions during the LGM remain a matter of debate. There is general agreement that the temperature was cooler than today, but there is no consensus about moisture conditions, especially over tropical latitudes. This paper reviews terrestrial and near-shore marine records from South America between 10 degrees N and 50 degrees S during the LGM. Records are selected for their chronological control, their continuity around the LGM and their regional representativeness. This review aims to show how regional climates of the sub-continent have responded to orbital forcing as opposed to other global glacial boundary conditions, and how they are related to positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and of the westerly belt. A clear pattern emerges for the northern and the southern latitudes, which were respectively drier and wetter, but in the tropical lowlands the pattern remains unclear. The characterization of this area is of particular interest because of the central role played by atmospheric convection centred on the Amazon basin. Modeling experiments argue for drier LGM tropical conditions but several lines of evidence contradict these results. Currently, moister conditions are explained by a glacial boundary forcing mechanism implying a southern shift of the ITCZ and a reinforcement of the South American summer monsoon (SASM), bringing more humidity to the tropical Andes as far as southern Brazil. This hypothesis may explain a large portion of the ecosystem responses during the LGM, but does not account for all observed changes. Paucity of site reconstructions (e.g. in the Amazon basin), and lack of quantitative paleoclimatic responses derived from proxies to environmental conditions could partly explain the observed discrepancies. Regional responses of mosaic environmental ecosystems to a generally cooler temperature could be involved, without any need to invoke precessionnal and extra-tropical influences.

In bulk samples, the Cr-54/Cr-52 ratios (expressed as epsilon Cr-54) range from 0.93 to 1.58 epsilon units. These values are in agreement with values characteristic for distinct petrologic types. Despite this 54 Cr heterogeneity, the variability in the Cr-54/Cr-52 ratios (expressed as epsilon Cr-53) of 0.2 epsilon units and the Mn/Cr ratios is consistent with the previous finding of an isochron in the Mn-Cr evolution diagram. The Mn/Cr ratio in CC corresponds to variable abundances of high-T condensate formed and separated at the beginning of the solar system, thus the canonical Mn-53/Mn-55 ratio can be defined. Based on a consistent chronology for U-Pb and Mn-Cr between the earliest objects formed in the solar nebula and the D'Orbigny angrite we define a canonical Mn-53/Mn-55 ratio and epsilon Cr-53(i) of 6.8 x 10(-6) and -0.177, respectively. The internal Mn/Cr systematics in Tafassasset and Paris were studied by two approaches: leaching technique and mineral separation. Despite variable epsilon Cr-54 values (up to >30 epsilon) linear co-variations were found between epsilon Cr-53 and Mn/Cr ratio. The mineral separates as well as the leachates of Tafassasset fall on a common isochron indicating that (1) cooling of the Tafassasset's parent body occurred at 4563.5 +/- 0.25 Ma, and that (2) Cr-54 is decoupled from the other isotopes even though temperatures >900 degrees C have been reached during metamorphism. In the case of Paris, the leachates form an alignment with a Mn-53/Mn-55 ratio higher than the canonical value. This alignment is not an isochron but rather a mixing line. Based on leachates from various CM and CI, we propose the occurrence of three distinct Cr reservoirs in meteoritic material: PURE54, HIGH53 and LOW53 characterized by a epsilon Cr-53 and epsilon Cr-54 of 0 and 25,000, -2.17 and 8, and 0.5 and -151, respectively. PURE54 has already been described and is carried by highly refractory nano-spinel; HIGH53 is Mn-rich and most probably carried by sulfides in the matrix, whereas LOW53 is characterized by low Mn/Cr ratios and it is sensitive to metamorphism. This component could correspond to mineral phases such as refractory oxides and carbide. Variable mixing proportions of HIGH53 and LOW53 would explain the larger-than-expected uncertainty (MSWD of 5.5) on the CC bulk regression line. A Monte Carlo simulation allows us to evaluate the impact of the dispersion of the initial Cr isotopic ratios (as a function of variable HIGH53). The co-variation of the Mn/Cr ratio and the epsilon Cr-53 defined by the mineral separates from Paris corresponds to an age of 4566.44(+0.66)/(-0.75) Ma, while their epsilon Cr-54 still differ by at least 0.42 epsilon. This age is likely to date the segregation of forsteritic olivines (most probably from type I chondrules) from fayalitic olivines (from type II chondrules) and, given the sampling procedure by handpicking of hundreds of grains, corresponds to the average age of chondrule formation.

J	Lambeck, K				Lambeck, K			Shoreline displacements in southern-central Sweden and the evolution of the Baltic Sea since the last maximum glaciation	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												During late- and post-glacial times the Baltic basin has been periodically isolated from the Atlantic and freshwater and saline conditions have alternated. This is a consequence of the interactions between the spatially variable glacial rebound of the region and the simultaneous eustatic sea-level rise in the adjacent Atlantic. Observations of the timing of these isolations and of the location of the barriers therefore provide constraints on the rebound models. High resolution numerical models of rebound of southern Sweden, the Danish straits, and the Baltic have been developed and tested against observations of lake-level change as well as against the observed elevations of the Last Baltic Ice Lake shoreline which formed before about 10.3 ka sp. Predictions of sea- and lake-levels are used to test two alternative hypotheses about the ice thickness over Scandinavia and to estimate parameters that describe the Earth's response. Optimum values for the latter are: lithospheric thickness of 60 +/- 20 km, upper-mantle viscosity of 3.3 x 10(20) Pa s, and lower-mantle viscosity of 10(22) Pa s. The rapid lake-level fall at the end of the Baltic Ice Lake stags is estimated to be 30 +/- 5 m. The optimum ice model for Scandinavia is one in which the ice thickness over southeastern and southern Scandinavia was relatively thin compared with the ice thickness over Sweden and Norway: the ice thickness in the southeast and south changes slowly with distance inwards of the ice margin whereas over Sweden and Norway the ice thickness profiles are considerably steeper. The earth and ice models have been combined with high-resolution digital terrain data to develop a comprehensive model for the evolution of the Baltic basin since the time the area last became ice free. The reconstructions predict the occurrence of barriers at certain times which impede free flow between the Atlantic and Baltic and confirm that the Baltic lake levels ape controlled by rebound at four localities; Degerfors in the Narke region of southern-central Sweden, the Vanern outlet through the Gota Alv, Oresund, and the Darss-Langelands-Store baelts in Denmark.																			0016-7649					MAY	1999	156		3				465	486		10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.156.3.0465													WOS:000080142400005

Overlooked and underrated: Influence of snowmelt runoff on lake-level rise rivals river floodwaters at a cold-region freshwater delta	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Snowmelt runoff is well-recognized as important for sustaining shallow waterbodies across semi-arid and subhumid cold regions where water loss via evaporation is relatively high, but is often overlooked in cold-region floodplains where river floodwaters are considered to drive freshwater availability. At the Peace-Athabasca Delta (northwestern Canada), drawdown of ecologically and culturally important shallow lakes is a longstanding concern. The drawdown is widely attributed to alteration of the ice-jam flood regime, but the direct influence of snowmelt runoff remains largely unknown. Here, measurements of water depth and isotope composition are used to evaluate contributions from snowmelt versus river floodwaters to lake-level rise after widespread ice-jam flooding in spring 2020. Results reveal lake-level rise from snowmelt input at non-flooded lakes (median = 0.32 m; n = 27) is comparable to that from river floodwaters at flooded lakes (median = 0.26 m; n = 25). Snowmelt accounted for more than one-third of the rise at flooded lakes. Lake-level rise by snowmelt was greatest in areas where greater topographic relief and forest/shrub vegetation entrap winddistributed snow from adjacent flat unforested terrain. In contrast, lake-level rise by floodwater was greatest in lower elevation flood-prone areas. Meteorological records of peak snow water equivalent and melt rate reveal that comparable contributions of snowmelt runoff to lake-level rise likely occurred regularly during 1963-1987 but values in 2020 (80 mm and 10.1 mm/day, respectively) have been exceeded just once since 1987 (in 2018), suggesting drawdown of lakes during recent decades may also be associated with reduced input of snowmelt.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	663		A						134036	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134036													WOS:001569400400001

The study uses a semiquantitative method based on a combination of selected indicators (plant macrofossils, mollusc shells, degree of peat decomposition) to estimate the relative changes in the water table position at Lustuzkalns alkaline fen, Latvia, Eastern Baltic Region. The study also aims to determine the time frames of CaCO3 deposition at the fen using loss on ignition and carbon and oxygen stable isotope records. The chronology of the three sediment sequences studied is based on the AMS radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Although the reconstructed water table positions revealed differences between the cores, the major shift from the low water tables persisting since ca. 5000 cal yr BP to the prevailing high water stands at ca. 3000 cal yr BP was common to all the sequences. The major shift observed is consistent with a change from low to high water tables in peatlands in Latvia and at numerous fens and bogs across the Eastern Baltic Region, Fennoscandia and NW Europe. Concurrent with the increase in the water tables was the onset of CaCO3 precipitation on the Lustuzkalns fen surface, which began at ca. 3000 cal yr BP and accelerated from ca. 2500 cal yr BP. The Late Holocene CaCO3 precipitation at Lustuzkalns can be attributed to the change from warm and dry conditions during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) to cooler but humid during the Late Holocene. In contrast, in Central and Western Europe, the main period of freshwater carbonate precipitation occurred during the warm and humid HTM.					; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Gałka, Mariusz/ABB-1744-2020; Pleskot, Krzysztof/HTQ-1814-2023	Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Szczepaniak, Malgorzata/0000-0002-6935-1437; Pleskot, Krzysztof/0000-0002-3724-1700; Kielczewski, Rafal/0000-0003-4900-3846; Galka, Mariusz/0000-0001-8906-944X													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUN 15	2024	334								108717	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108717		MAY 2024											WOS:001300884800001

In this study will be given briefly the rocks in these basins and their hydrochemical relation with surface and subsurface water The Lower - Middle Cambrian Caltepe formation comprises of dolomite, crystallized limestone and nodular limestone, occurs at the basement and, has reservoir rock characteristics. The Upper Cambrian - Lower Ordovician Seydisehir formation overlies conformably the Caltepe formation and comprises of schist, phillite and shale bearing limestone and quartzite lenses in places. The Anamasdagi formation which is the most important reservoir rock in the study area has widespread outcrops around the lake and rest unconformable on the Seydisehir formation. It is composed of conglomerate, marl, sandstone, ferric bauxite, dolomite, limestone and, is Upper Jurassic - Upper Cretaceous in age. The Hoyran complex comprising of serpantinite, pyroxenite, harzburgite, dunite, diabase and chromites emplaced tectonically over the abovementioned units. This unit has outcrops starting from northern part of the Beysehir lake extending approximately in the NNW- SSE direction up to the Yesildag town located at the south of the lake. Besides, the Eocene Buyukkopru formation comes unconformable on these units and, begins at the bottom, with the red marl and continues with mudstone - claystone - turbiditic sandstone. The Toprakli formation is made up of partially consolidated pebble, sand and clay and, covers all the abovementioned units. Karstification and their size in the limestone which are widespread in the basin and which are mostly forming the reservoir rock were interpreted by means of their chemical analysis results.

This paper presents the first continuous delta C-13 and delta O-18 dataset for ostracod shells (Cytherissa lacustris) from Lake Hovsgol sediments. A positive shift in ostracod delta C-13 values (from +0.5 parts per thousand to +3.2 parts per thousand) began at ca. 21 cal ka BP, and was associated with a decrease in delta C-13 values of total organic carbon (from -24.7 parts per thousand to -27.3 parts per thousand) and an increase in the mass accumulation rate of total organic carbon (MAR-TOC). These results suggest that increased lake productivity led to the C-13-enrichment of dissolved inorganic carbon in Lake Hovsgol. In addition, decreases in clay content and the illite crystallinity index (full width at half maximum of the 10 angstrom peak) began at ca. 21 cal ka BP, indicating an increase in surface runoff and a change in sources of clastic materials in the watershed. The highest delta O-18(ostracod) values (up to -4.8 parts per thousand) at 16-15 cal ka BP indicate the increases in precipitation from the East Asian monsoon. The total pollen amount increased, and Betula, Alms, and Salty were dominant (up to 53%, 30%, and 6%, respectively) after 16-15 cal ka BP. These findings indicate that broad-leaved trees expanded around Lake Hovsgol. In addition, fossil diatom valves appeared after 16-15 cal ka BP, suggesting climate amelioration, and increased input of soil-derived nutrients and dissolved silica. Between 10 and 5 cal ka BP (Holocene climate optimum), productivity was high in and around the lake (MAR-TOC, up to 47.3 mg/cm(2) kyr; MAR-diatoms, up to 14.4 x 10(8) valves/cm(2) kyr: total pollen concentration, up to 9.0 x 10(5) grains/cm(3)). Environmental changes during the last 29 kyr in and around Lake Hovsgol are clearly associated with fluctuations in summer insolation and East Asian monsoon intensity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the northwestern South China Sea, there are complex physical processes, and the accurate estimation of K-d(z, lambda) in the northwestern South China Sea is critical for the study and application of the underwater light field and water constituents. In this study, using Hydrolight 6.0 (HL60) software, K-d(z, lambda) was simulated based on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) and chlorophyll a concentration dataset in the northwestern South China Sea. The simulations were in good agreement with the results calculated by the model of Lee (2005), and the spectral characteristics of K-d(z, lambda) were consistent with several oceanic types according to Jerlov's classification. The horizontal and vertical distribution characteristics of K-d(z, 490) were studied in the two typical upwelling areas of eastern Hainan Island and eastern Vietnam. K-d(z, 490) in eastern Hainan Island exhibited an overall decreasing trend from west to east at the same depth, while the vertical depth of the maximum value of K-d(z, 490) in eastern Hainan Island was found to increase from west to east, which was significantly associated with the distribution trend of the temperature and salinity. K-d(z, 490) in eastern Vietnam exhibited unique horizontal and vertical distribution characteristics due to upwelling, with a low temperature and high salinity. A satisfactory linear relationship between K-d(z, 490) and K-d(z, lambda) was found from 420 to 580 nm with R-2 > 0.76, root mean square (RMSE) = 0.010 m(-1), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) < 9%, and this result indicated that K-d(z, lambda) from 420 similar to 580 nm could be estimated with K-d(z, 490). The regression accuracy sharply decreased after 580 nm, indicating that K-d(z, lambda) estimation based on K-d(z, 490) can be more suitably achieved from 420 similar to 580 nm and becomes inaccurate after 580 nm. Based on the simulations, an empirical relationship for Z(SDD) estimation involving K-d,K-10%(490) was developed, and Z(SDD) in the northwestern South China Sea was calculated, with a range of 5-23 m and a suitable agreement with Z(SDD) obtained via the method of Lee (2018).

Extending the record of lacustrine phases beyond the last interglacial for Lake Eyre in central Australia using luminescence dating	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We show with multiple luminescence dating techniques that the sedimentary record for Lake Eyre, Australia's largest lake, extends beyond 200 thousand years (ka) to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7. Transgressive clayey sand and finely laminated clays overlying the Miocene Etadunna Formation in Lake Eyre North document the deep-lake phases of central South Australia in the past. Until now, unresolved chronology has hampered our ability to interpret these sedimentary records, which are important for understanding the timing of the wettest phase of central Australia's late Quaternary climate. In this study, we apply quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL) dating and K-feldspar post infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating to lake-floor sediments near Williams Point in Madigan Gulf to provide new age constraint for the lacustrine sediments of Lake Eyre. Methodological studies on quartz and K-feldspar demonstrate that these luminescence dating procedures are suitable for the Lake Eyre lacustrine samples and produce consistent replicate ages. A Bayesian model applied to the new dating results provides a chronological model of lacustrine deposition and shows that the transgressive clayey sand were deposited 221 +/- 19 ka to 201 +/- 101<a and that the deep-water sediments were laid down in early MIS 6 (191 +/- 9 ka to 181 +/- 9 ka). We also find evidence for a potential depositional hiatus in mid MIS 6 and the likely formation of a palaeo-playa later in MIS 6 from 158 +/- 11 ka to 143 +/- 15 ka. In contrast, the MIS 5 sediments are characterised by oscillating deep- and shallow-water lacustrine units deposited 130 +/- 16 ka to 113 +/- 20 ka. This study is the first of its kind to provide evidence for a wet desert interior in Australia beyond the last glacial cycle using comprehensive numerical dating. Our results show that past deep-lake episodes of central South Australia, which were previously thought to represent peak interglacial conditions, are actually associated with both warm interglacial and cold glacial periods, with all the wettest episodes generally coinciding with the intervening periods between the glacial and interglacial maximums. We assume from these results that orbital forcing is not a first order control for the long-term dynamics of the Lake Eyre basin and the Indo-Australian monsoon. The high lake-level events of Lake Eyre are well correlated with millennial-scale cooling events and stadials of the North Atlantic, and coincide with weakened episodes/events for the East Asia summer monsoon. This may imply an important role for the northern high latitudes in influencing the Indo-Australian monsoon, which may be associated with a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during cooling periods in the North Atlantic.

Re-oligotrophication by phosphorus reduction and effects on seston quality in lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												We review published data of re-oligotrophication studies in different types of lakes and discuss whether re-oligotrophication by phosphorus reduction measure can affect seston quality in lakes due to an increase in C:P ratios of food for zooplankton. We analyze whether such an increase in elemental ratio may give rise to a stoichiometric constraint or bottleneck for regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton and thus cause a decrease in trophic transfer efficiency. Because seston C:P ratios of seston tend to decrease with increasing P concentration in lakes, i.e. by increasing eutrophication, the reverse may be true, i.e. the C:P ratio of the seston will increase when lakes become reoligotrophicated by P reduction. This may imply lower food quality for P-demanding seston grazers, like Daphnia, which have both relatively low C:P ratios and are quite homeostatic with regard to C:P ratios. Consequently. the reduced grazer biomass may lead to lower grazing pressure on the phytoplankton and may result in lower trophic transfer efficiency. On the other hand, oligotrophication commonly leads to improved food quality in terms of composition of the phytoplankton community, e.g. increase of mixotrophs and reduced share of cyanobacteria. These two qualitative traits of seston (higher C:P ratios and change in phytoplankton composition) may thus work in opposite directions during re-oligotrophication. Most investigated lakes - both deep and shallow - responded by improvement in underwater light climate due to reduction of P loadings. Several compensatory mechanisms prevented the occurrence of a stoichiometric bottleneck for top-down control. From a few documented cases of both deep and shallow lakes, where seston stoichiometry, the presence of Daphnia and the trophic transfer efficiency were concurrently measured during the process of re-oligotrophication, we may conclude that the anticipated increase in C:P ratios of the seston is not straightforward. It depends on lake-specific properties such as morphometry, water residence time, water temperature and trophic structure. A stoichiometric bottleneck is only likely to occur during summer in (1) the epilimnion of small deep and stratified lakes with a long water residence time and low mixing regime, and (2) shallow lakes with high C:P ratios caused by a relatively high detritus content of seston and/or grazing resistant algae, like colony forming cyanobacteria.

Significant time and resources are invested to start acoustic telemetry studies; therefore, careful planning is needed to limit post-release mortality of tagged individuals. Deep, cold-water species present additional challenges to acoustic tagging because of changes in temperature and pressure experienced during capture. The objective of our study was to determine if capture method, surface water temperature, water depth, or fish size influenced short-term post-release survival of a deep, cold-water species, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush. In 2023, 299 Lake Trout were captured with angling or gillnets across Lake Ontario (Laurentian Great Lake - U.S. & CAN) and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. We estimated 30-day post-release mortality and 24-h post-release distance traveled for tagged Lake Trout. We used Cox proportional hazards models to identify factors affecting survival probability and multiple linear regression to identify factors affecting post-release distance traveled. Thirty-day post-release mortality was minimal (9.03 %, 27/299 Lake Trout); however, mortality was 6.37 times more likely for Lake Trout captured in gillnets compare to angling (p = 0.003). Lake Trout length had a marginally significant effect on mortality (p = 0.052) but capture depth and temperature did not (p > 0.05). Lake Trout post-release distance traveled was not significantly influenced by capture gear, depth, temperature, or Lake Trout length (p = 0.61). Our results indicate that tagging-induced postrelease mortality is minimal for Lake Trout tagged in the spring, but survival can be increased by avoiding use of gillnets.

This region experiences arid climate conditions with high evaporation rates, extreme daily and annual thermal variations, intense winds, and exceptionally high radiation levels, creating harsh conditions for life. HAWs depend hydrologically on groundwater and inputs from the scarce rainfalls, streams, rivers, or snowmelt, making them unique to the Andean Altiplano landscape. Since pre-Hispanic times, they have provided essential ecosystem, social, and cultural functions in arid zones. In this study, the spatial heterogeneity of surface sediments in Salar de Quisquiro-Loyoques, in the Puna plateau of northern Chile, was examined. Through an integrated analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) anomalies over the last 30 years supplemented by narratives from the Lickan Antay Community of Toconao about wet and arid events in the Quisquiro wetland, its relation to current and historical processes driven by exogenous forces was examined. Depositional conditions facilitate the formation or entry of sediments into these shallow water environments, making them highly dynamic. Differences in mineralogical, chemical, and magnetic properties were observed in inter- and intra-sampling points, where the salt flat was the most heterogeneous sub-environment analyzed. A close relationship between precipitation and water availability, and vegetation cover is suggested. Given the current potential for increasing non-metallic mining prospecting in the region, it is necessary to highlight the territorial rights, autonomy, and claims of the indigenous communities, who have preserved HAWs through their ancient identification with the territory and the use and comprehensive cultural and management practices in the past and at present.

River currents reduce or eliminate internal recruitment by local populations, making them dependent upon external recruitment from propagules (larvae) produced by upriver populations. Because of the importance of external recruitment, understanding the population dynamics of riverine zebra mussels requires knowledge of larval flux. In 1994 and 1995, larval drift past a fixed site on the Illinois River was characterized by pulses of similar-sized individuals. These pulses were composed primarily of D-stage (straight hinge) larvae, not yet competent to settle. The continual passage of pulses of young larvae suggests that the upriver source population(s) spawned in frequent distinct bursts throughout the summer months rather than spawning only once or twice. Overall larval abundance was a poor predictor of availability of competent larvae. Although larvae were frequently present in high numbers, larvae >200 mu m in shell height (competent to settle) were present only sporadically at our fixed study site from May to November in 1994, and present only from June to early July in 1995. Settlement at a given site on the Illinois River is likely to be sporadic rather than constant. Colonization and population growth at a given site will occur only if suitable habitat and environmental conditions are available during the windows when competent larvae are available. Changes in mean size as a larval cohort drifted downriver suggested a growth rate of 6.72 mu m/d. At this growth rate, most larvae probably travel a minimum of 304.6 km (190.4 miles) before settling. Thus, larvae spawned in the main channel of the lower 70% of the Illinois River are most likely to settle in the Mississippi River. We suggest that colonization and population growth in the upper 70% of the Illinois River are strongly dependent upon larvae produced at upriver source sites in Lake Michigan and the Chicago area waterways. Control of zebra mussels in a given stretch of the river will depend upon control of the upriver source populations.

Quantitative analysis of late summer fish, zooplankton, mysid and macrophyte populations was undertaken in 20-36 shallow brackish lakes of various trophic states and the findings compared with a similar analysis of shallow freshwater lakes based on either sampling (fish) or existing data (zooplankton, mysids and macrophytes). Special emphasis was placed on differences in pelagic top-down control. Whereas the fish biomass (CPUE, multiple mesh-size gill nets) rose with increasing P-concentration in freshwater lakes, that of brackish lakes was markedly reduced at P-concentrations above ca. 0.4 mg P l-1 and there was a concomitant shift to exclusive dominance by the small sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius); as a result, fish density remained relatively high. Mysids (Neomysis integer) were found at a salinity greater than 0.5 parts per thousand and increased substantially with increasing P-concentration, reaching levels as high as 13 ind. l-1. This is in contrast to the carnivorous zooplankton of freshwater lakes, which are most abundant at intermediate P levels. The efficient algal controller, Daphnia was only found at a salinity below 2 parts per thousand and N. integer in lakes with a salinity above 0.5 parts per thousand. Above 2 parts per thousand the filter-feeding zooplankton were usually dominated by the less efficient algal controllers Eurytemora and Acartia. In contrast to freshwater lakes, no shift to a clearwater state was found in eutrophic brackish lakes when submerged macrophytes became abundant. We conclude that predation pressure on zooplankton is higher and algal grazing capacity lower in brackish eutrophic-hypertrophic lakes than in comparable freshwater lakes, and that the differences in trophic structure of brackish and freshwater lakes have major implications for the measures available to reduce the recovery period following a reduction in nutrient loading. From the point of view of top-down control, the salinity threshold dividing freshwater and brackish lakes is much lower than the conventionally defined 5 parts per thousand.

J	Parker, AG; Goudie, AS				Parker, Adrian G.; Goudie, Andrew S.			Geomorphological and palaeoenvironmental investigations in the southeastern Arabian Gulf region and the implication for the archaeology of the region	GEOMORPHOLOGY												During the Late Quaternary, the climate of Arabia has fluctuated between periods of higher rainfall and fluvial activity, dominated by the influence of the Indian Ocean Monsoon (IOM) and drier/arid conditions under the influence of the westerlies. This has left a rich legacy of landforms from which temporal and spatial patterns of environmental change are reconstructed. The coastal desert region of the southeastern Arabian Gulf has been a focal point for human settlement since similar to 8000 cat yr BP. The region is strategically located on an important trade route between two 'cradles of civilization', namely, Mesopotamia and the Indus. Changes in the evolution and modification of this landscape under varying climatic conditions have influenced humans living in and exploiting this landscape for food and water, raw materials and trade routes. In this study, geomorphological and palaeoenvironmental investigations are integrated to provide a framework of environmental change for the Late Glacial and early-mid Holocene periods against which the archaeology of the area can be set. The Late Glacial and earliest Holocene was characterised by intense aridity and accumulation of mega linear dunes driven by the Shamal winds. In the Arabian Gulf region, this continued into the earliest part of the Holocene, whilst southern Arabia was under the influence of the IOM. The monsoon rains migrated into the Gulf region between 8500-6000 cat BP. During this time, semi-nomadic herders occupied this region and grazing their animals in a landscape covered with C3 savanna grassland. The Neolithic peoples also practised hunting and fishing and the collection of shellfish was an important activity. Pottery shows links with Mesopotamia at this time. From 6000 cat BP the IOM retreated south and rainfall was derived from winterly westerly sources. Under drier conditions a switch occurred to a sparser cover of C4 grasses. From 4500 cat BP the climate became much drier with the development of stronger westerly summer Shamal winds and the reactivation of dunes across the region. An intense and period occurred at 4100 BP which corresponds with major drought conditions in Mesopotamia and the Indus region, which led to major changes in society. This event occurs at a major transition in the Arabian Gulf Bronze Age archaeological record with a decline in population and trade. The last 4000 yr has largely been characterised by arid conditions similar to those found in the region today. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Nutrient loading effects on fish habitat quality: Trade-offs between enhanced production and hypoxia in Lake Erie, North America	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Across diverse systems, nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources into aquatic systems has increased over the past century. Such nutrient inputs may enhance system productivity and thereby increase resource availability but may also lead to undesirable conditions such as hypoxic zones. We examined the habitat quality trade-offs associated with increases in phosphorus in a model system (Lake Erie, North America) with a history of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Using a water quality model and a bioenergetics growth rate potential model with fine vertical and temporal resolution, we assessed how the quality of habitat for multiple species of adult and juvenile fish changed across a range of phosphorus loading scenarios and across 19 different meteorological years. Increases in phosphorus loading increased invertebrate prey biomass, but also increased the duration and extent of the mid-summer hypoxic zone. In general, phosphorus loading caused overall habitat quality to decline and only increased peak habitat quality (i.e., spatio-temporal locations where temperature and prey abundance were already above average), but responses were species- and life-stage specific. One challenge in ascertaining the effects of nutrient loading on fish habitat quality is separating the negative effects of hypoxia from the potential positive effects of increased prey densities. Through various model scenarios, we evaluated the individual effects of hypoxia and increased prey availability on fish habitat quality, demonstrating their potentially counter-balancing effects. That is, the negative effects of low oxygen on fish habitat quality appear more severe if the prospect that increased hypoxia is accompanied by altered prey densities is not accounted for. Despite modelled responses to altered phosphorus loads, habitat quality responded more strongly to variation in annual meteorological conditions. Annual meteorological conditions such as temperature, vertical mixing, and timing of phosphorus loading had a greater effect on habitat quality for all species and life-stages than changes in annual amount of phosphorus loading. This limited effect of changes in phosphorus loading on habitat quality probably partially reflects our focus on short-term (1-year) changes in loading. Thus, nutrient abatement programmes may not lead to obvious, rapid positive habitat quality responses, as short-term meteorological effects may overwhelm effects related to nutrient reduction and changes in prey densities may partially offset the benefits of decreased hypoxic conditions.

Migratory Flyways May Affect Population Structure in Double-Crested Cormorants	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) recovered from a demographic bottleneck so well that they are now considered a nuisance species at breeding and wintering grounds across the United States and Canada. Management of this species could be improved by refining genetic population boundaries and assigning individuals to their natal population. Further, recent radio-telemetry data suggest the existence of Interior and Atlantic migratory flyways, which could reduce gene flow and result in substantial genetic isolation. In this study, we used 1,784 individuals collected across the eastern United States, a large panel of microsatellite markers developed for this species, and individuals banded as chicks and recaptured as adults to explore the effects of migratory flyways on population structure, quantify the genetic effects of demographic bottlenecks, and determine whether individuals could be assigned to their natal population based on genotype. We found evidence for genetic population division only along migratory flyways, no evidence of genetic bottlenecks, and mixed effectiveness of assignment tests. Our population structure findings suggest that gene flow is high across large scales; for example, individuals from New York, Minnesota, and Alabama are all in panmixia. We also found that traditional subspecies ranges may not be valid because >1 subspecies was present in single genetic populations. The lack of evidence for genetic bottlenecks also likely underscores the vagility of this species, suggesting that even during demographic bottlenecks, populations were not isolated from allelic exchange. Finally, the failure of assignment tests to consistently perform is likely due in part to imperfect a priori sampling of Atlantic and Interior chicks and the high vagility of adults. We conclude that the demographic bottleneck is not likely to have reduced genetic diversity, and that assignment tests remain unreliable for this species. We recommend double-crested cormorants be managed by flyway. Further development of genomic resources in this species could improve population subdivision resolution, improve assignment tests, and reveal further information on demographic histories.

The sediments have survived the El'gygytgyn meteorite impact event at similar to 3.58 Ma. The stratigraphy of the studied outcrops suggests that the lowermost sediments were accumulated shortly before the impact event, between similar to 3.60 and 3.58 Ma. At that time, coniferous forests with spruces, pines, firs, birches, larches, and alders dominated in the area. Some relatively thermophilic broad-leaved taxa (Corylus, Carpinus, Ulmus, and Myrica) might also have grown in local forests. Summer temperatures were at least 10 degrees C warmer than today. Charcoal concentrations and composition suggest the presence of high intensity fires. Periods of rather wet climate and soil conditions are marked by common shrubby and boggy habitats with ericaceous plants and Sphagnum, and are associated with less, and probably low-intensity surface fires with less charcoal. The impact event caused widespread fires reflected by up to 4 times higher charcoal concentrations in the sediments. The sediments found above the so-called "chaotic horizon" (sediments accumulated synchronously or very shortly after the impact event) contain late Pliocene pollen assemblages comparable to those in Lake El'gygytgyn, reflecting that pine-spruce forests with some firs, birches, larches, and alder dominated in the study area. Some thermophilic taxa might also still have grown in the area. However, the age control for the sediments above the so-called chaotic horizon is poor. The uppermost sediments from the studied sections can be attributed with certainty to the Late Pleistocene and Holocene according to their stratigraphic positions and pollen assemblages. The combined pollen and charcoal analysis allowed correlating hardly datable fluvial sediments and points to varying fire regimes in warmer-than-present climates, when forest extended further north compared to today.

Nine of the major river drainages have waters containing infected fish: Beaverhead, Big Hole, Blackfoot, Clark Fork above the Bitterroot River, Flathead below the south fork of the Flathead River, Jefferson, Madison, Missouri above the Marias River, and Yellowstone above the Bighorn River. The Beaverhead, Clark Fork above the Bitterroot River, Jefferson, Madison, and Missouri above the Marias River have the greatest number of waters containing fish infected with M. cerebralis. Comparisons of infection levels (number of pooled samples that contain fish infected with M cerebralis) between species among these drainages show significantly lower levels of infection in brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Missouri above the Marias River drainage and significantly higher levels of infection of rainbow trout in the Jefferson. Comparisons of differences in infection levels between drainages among species show that, in the Beaverhead, Clark Fork above the Bitterroot River, and Madison, infection levels in brown trout are significantly higher than in rainbow trout. This is partially attributed to losses of juvenile rainbow trout because of M cerebralis infection, leading to biased samples. Histopathologic studies showed lesions were consistently less severe in brown trout than other species and occurred in a different location (gill arches versus ventral calvarium). In six of the nine affected drainages (Beaverhead, Blackfoot, Clark Fork above the Bitterroot River, Flathead below the South Fork, Jefferson, and Madison), infected fish were found at or near the time that intensive sampling was initiated in the spring of 1995. In the three remaining affected drainages (Missouri above the Marias River, Yellowstone above the Bighorn River, and the Big Hole), infected fish were not identified until at least 15 months after the initiation of widespread testing. This indicates that in the first six drainages listed above, the infection was well established prior to 1995 but spread into the last three drainages in the ensuing months. Methods of transmission and the sources of infection are unknown, although the absence of infected fish in state, private, and federal hatcheries in Montana indicates hatchery fish from these sources are not likely to be responsible.																			0899-7659	1548-8667				DEC	1998	10	4					361	371		10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0361:DOMCIS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0361:DOMCIS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000078758900006

Field collected fourth instar larvae were exposed in their original sediment to the desired conditions in a continuous flow system. Behavioural patterns were registered and quantified by impedance conversion. In air saturated water, both species spend most of their time in inactivity or performing active behaviour associated with feeding or tube repair. S. histrio, however, is active for most of the time (84 %), whereas Ch. anthracinus spends 50 % of its time in inactivity. Exposure to an oxygen concentration of 3 mg/l induces an instantaneous response in S. bistrio recognizable by a fast increase in the time spent ventilating (77 % of the maximum value within 1.5h). Cb. anthracinus responds more slowly: after 24h, only 21 % of the time is spent ventilating (43 % of the maximum value). In both species, a relation was observed between the oxygen concentration of the surrounding water and the time spent ventilating. However, S. histrio is ventilating for most of the time at concentrations of 3 mg/l and lower, leaving almost no time for other activities (e.g. feeding). Ch. anthracinus, on the other hand, exhibits active behaviour other than ventilation even at an oxygen concentration of 2 mg/l. The experimental results suggest that Ch. anthracinus should be able to function better at low oxygen concentrations than S. bistrio. Data on distribution patterns of these species show that a behavioural adaptation to low oxygen concentrations is more relevant for Ch. anthracinus than S. histrio. Ch. anthracinus occurs primarily in the hypolimnetic sediments which become hypoxic and even anoxic during summer stratification. S. histrio is inhabiting the sandy littoral sediments of the lake, where oxygen concentrations usually approach saturation. Gut investigations of field collected larvae of Cb. anthracinus confirm that these larvae were still able to feed at oxygen concentrations as low as 2.5 mg/l.																			0003-9136					APR	1992	124	2					173	185																WOS:A1992HQ16500004
J	SPENCER, MJ				SPENCER, MJ			TROPHIC STATUS OF 21 NEW-ZEALAND HIGH COUNTRY LAKES	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Between Dec. 1975 and March 1976 base-line data were obtained from 21 North Canterbury high country lakes located in 3 major river catchments to establish their relative trophic status. Included were 2 lakes (Coleridge and Sumner) on the New Zealand Officials Committee on Eutrophication base-line study list, and 2 lakes (Marion and Vagabond''s Inn) in the IBP Project Aqua series. The following biological parameters were measured: heterotrophic potential (Vmax), total bacterial counts, total and microbial adenosine triphosphate (ATP), chlorophyll [Chl] a and pH. Chemical analyses included dissolved O2; alkalinity; free and total CO2; N and P compounds; chloride; Ca and Mg. On the basis of Vmax, the lakes were separated into mesotrophic and oligotrophic groupings, in the following decreasing order of relative trophic status: mesotrophic.sbd.Lakes Little Mason, Marymere, Vagabond''s Inn, Evelyn and Ida (mean Vmax 0.071 .mu.g.cntdot.1-1.cntdot.h-1); Lakes Marion, Letitia, Sarah, Grasmere and Sheppard (mean Vmax 0.031 .mu.g.cntdot.1-1.cntdot.h-1). Oligotrophic.sbd.Lakes Katrine, Catherine, Hawden, Pearson, Taylor, Lyndon, Georgina, and Selfe (mean Vmax 0.017 .mu.g.cntdot.1-1.cntdot.h-1); Lakes Big Mason, Summer and Coleridge (mean Vmax 0.002 .mu.g.cntdot.1-1.cntdot.h-1). (Glucose was used as the substrate for Vmax determinations.) Total bacterial counts and concentrations of ATP, Chl a, total N, and total P for these four groupings substantiated the breakdown by the relative Vmax values. Lakes Coleridge and Sumner had very low levels of microbial activity and nutrients characteristic of large, deep oligotrophic lakes, while Lakes Marion and Vagabond''s Inn were higher in trophic status than previously reported. The heterotrophic potential technique can be used to investigate the trophic status of poorly accessible lakes, even when prolonged periods in the field delay the analyses.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1978	12	2					139	151		10.1080/00288330.1978.9515735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1978.9515735													WOS:A1978GA80100006

One such material is the highly volatile substance perchloroethene (PER; TECE). PER is produced in large quantities all over the world by the chemical industry. There are many industrial processes in which PER escapes into the environment, especially the atmosphere. It has since been proven that after entering plants via the air/leaf pathway, airborne PER can be metabolised into the phytotoxic substance trichloroacetic acid. However our own studies detected relatively high levels of TCA in environmental compartments in regions far away from industry which cannot be explained by the anthropogenic input of airborne substances into the relevant ecosystems. This indicates that natural PER emittents also exist and must be identified, in order to find out more about the global spread of PER. This paper reports on the findings of related fieldwork in the Kalmykian Steppe. This area of steppe in southern Russia spans an area extending west-to-east from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and north-to-south between the Greater Caucasus and Volgograd. The main aim of the experiments in the Kalmykian Steppe was to study water from lakes, rivers and springs with differing levels of salinity. The concentrations of the chlorinated hydrocarbons (VCHCs) chloroform (CHCl3). tetrachloromethane (CCl4), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-C2H3Cl3), trichloroethene (TRI; C2HCl3), tetrachloroethene (PER; C2Cl4) and TCA in these waters were measured, along with the levels of cations and anions and the pH-value of the waters. The measurements indicate that in particular water from salt lakes located in semiarid/ and areas of the study region must be considered as new types of natural emittents of PER and other chlorinated hydrocarbons as well as trichloroacetic acid. Furthermore, attention is drawn to ecological impacts resulting from the occurrence of these substances in connection with the desertification observed in this area since the mid-20th century. Possible global associations between TCA phytotoxicity, the consumption of water by contaminated plants and the resulting impact on the regional water cycle are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Martinez, AJ; Visvesvara, GS				Martinez, AJ; Visvesvara, GS			Free-living, amphizoic and opportunistic amebas	BRAIN PATHOLOGY												Amebas belonging to the genera Naegleria, Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia are free-living, amphizoic and opportunistic protozoa that are ubiquitous in nature. These amebas are found in soil, water and air samples from all over the world. Human infection due to these amebas involving brain, skin, lung and eyes has increased significantly during the last 10 years. The epidemiology, immunology, protozoology, pathology, and clinical features of the infections produced by these protozoa differ strikingly. Infection by the pathogenic Naegleria fowleri is acquired by exposure to polluted water in ponds, swimming pools and man-made lakes. Raised temperatures during the hot summer months or warm water from power plants facilitate the growth of N. fowleri. IV. fowleri is a thermophilic ameba that grows well in tropical and subtropical climates. The CNS infection, called Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), produced by N. fowleri is characterized by an acute fulminant meningoencephalitis leading to death 3-7 days after exposure. Victims are healthy, young individuals with a history of recent water-related sport activities. The portal of entry is the olfactory neuroepithelium. The pathologic changes are an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing meningoencephalitis with modest purulent exudate, mainly at the base of the brain, brainstem and cerebellum. Trophozoites can be seen within the CNS lesions located mainly around blood vessels. Thus far 179 cases have been reported; 81 in the USA alone. Balamuthia mandrillaris and several species of Acanthamoeba are pathogenic ''opportunistic'' free-living amebas which cause Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE) in humans and animals. GAE is an infection, usually seen in debilitated, malnourished individuals, in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplants and in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The granulomatous component is negligible, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Pathologically these amebas produce a patchy, chronic or subacute granulomatous encephalitis with the presence of trophozoites and cysts. The portal of entry is probably through the respiratory tract or an ulceration of the skin reaching the CNS by hematogenous spread. As of October 1, 1996, 166 cases (103 due to Acanthamoeba and 63 due to Balamuthia) of GAE have been reported from around the world. Of these 103 cases due to Acanthamoeba (72 have been reported in the USA alone, > 50 in AIDS), It is well known that several species of Acanthamoeba can also produce, chronic sight threatening ulceration of the cornea called Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), mostly in contact lens wearers or in individuals with minor corneal abrasions. Hundreds of cases of AK have been documented world wide.																			1015-6305	1750-3639				JAN	1997	7	1					583	598		10.1111/j.1750-3639.1997.tb01076.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3639.1997.tb01076.x								9034567					WOS:A1997WD34100006

Toward the Creation of a Large-Scale Map Series from Topographic and Geologic Databases for the Laqlouq Region, Lebanon	RECENT ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE FROM THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN AND SURROUNDING REGIONS, EMCEI-4 2022	Advances in Science Technology and Innovation				4th Euro-Mediterranean Conference for Environmental Integration-EMCEI	NOV 01-04, 2022	Sousse, TUNISIA					Remote sensing, global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS) are all emerging geospatial technologies that can produce detailed topographic and geologic maps. The evolving satellite data quality, GIS data processing, and graphical tools speeded up mapping creation and led to more accurate results. Due to the absence of these maps for Lebanon at a scale larger than 1:50,000, this study employed the power of satellite images and GIS and developed a practical method to reconstruct, for the first time in Lebanon, digital topographic and geologic map series at a scale of 1:5000 for Laqlouq region. Louis Dubertret, the founder of modern geology, was the first to construct a geological map of Lebanon at 1:200,000 in 1955. He also developed a geological database on a scale of 1:50,000. Yet, no research was thereafter conducted to construct a geological map of Lebanon on a larger scale. This study demonstrated a practical method that generated the large-scale map series using (1) Pleiades imagery (0.5 m); (2) ALOS PALSAR DEM (12.5 m); (3) toposheets (1:20,000); (4) geological map of Qartaba region (1:50,000); (5) open street map database of existing roads, buildings, and annotations; and (6) geological data collected during field observations using a sub-meter GPS receiver. Geologic and topographic databases were generated as follows: 10 m contour lines, hill shade, 602 sinkholes, hydrographic networks, 130 lakes, 162 springs, and geologic boundaries. In this study, geospatial technologies proved to be essential strategies for enhancing topographic and geologic mapping and conducting a large-scale practical exploration of many types of resources. The adopted approach produced a geologic and cartographic database on a regional scale that can be expanded to cover all Lebanese territories in the future.

At present Lake Sihwa tidal power plant is completed. The plant is consisted of 10 bulb type turbines with 8 sluice gates. The installed capacity of turbines and generators is 254MW and annual energy output expected is about 552.7 GWh taking flood flow generation scheme. Three other TPP projects are being progressed at Garolim Bay (20 turbines with 25.4MW capacity), Kangwha (28 turbines with 25.4MW capacity), Incheon (44 or 48 turbines with 30 MW capacity) and project features will be outlined. The introduction of tidal barrages into four major TPP projects along the Kyeonggi bay will render wide range of potential impacts. Preliminary attempts were performed to quantify these impacts using 2 D hydrodynamic model demonstrating the changes in tidal amplitude and phase under mean tidal condition, associated changes in residual circulation (indicator for SPM and pollutant dispersion), bottom stress (indicator for bedload movement), and tidal front (positional indicator for bio-productivity) in both shelf scale and local context. Tidal regime modeling system for ocean tides in the seas bordering the Korean Peninsula is designed to cover an area that is broad in scope and size, yet provide a high degree of resolution in strong tidal current region including off southwestern tip of the Peninsula (Uldolmok, Jangjuk, Wando-Hoenggan), Daebang Sudo (Channel) and Kyeonggi Bay.

J	Xie, P; Yang, Y				Xie, P; Yang, Y			Long-term changes of Copepoda community (1957-1996) in a subtropical Chinese lake stocked densely with planktivorous filter-feeding silver and bighead carp	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In contrast to the relatively well documented impact of particulate-feeding fish on zooplankton communities, little attention has been devoted to the impact of filter-feeding fish. Filter-feeding silver and bighead carp are the most intensively cultured fish species in Asia and comprise much of the production of Chinese aquaculture. However, little information is known about the impact of either fish on the zooplankton community. Long-term changes in the Copepoda community (1957-1996) were studied at two sampling stations of a subtropical Chinese lake (Lake Donghu) dominated by silver and bighead carp. For both calanoids and cyclopoids, the littoral station (I) was much more resource profitable than the pelagic station (II). There has been a tremendous increase in the annual fish catch over the past 30 years due to the increased stocking with fingerlings of the two carp species. There was a notably higher fish density at Station I than at Station II. Cyclopoid abundance was notably higher at Station I than at Station II during the 1950s to the 1980s, while the reverse became true in the 1990s. This is probably because when fish abundance increased to an extremely high level, the impact of fish predation on the cyclopoids became more important than that of food resources at the littoral station. At both stations, cyclopoid abundance was relatively low in spite of the presence of abundant prey. Similarly, calanoid density did not differ significantly between the two stations in the 1950s and 1960s, but was significantly lower at Station I than at Station II during the 1980s and 1990s. Such changes are attributed to the gradient of fish predation between the stations and an increasing predation pressure by the fish. The increased fish predation also correlated with a shift in summer-dominant calanoids from larger species to smaller ones. In conclusion, the predaceous cyclopoids are affected by fish predation to a much lesser extent than the herbivorous calanoids, and therefore increased predation by filter-feeding fish results in a definite increase in the cyclopoid/calanoid ratio. Predation by filter-feeding fish has been a driving force in shaping the copepod community structure of Lake Donghu during the past decades.

Comparison of Relative and Absolute Abundance and Biomass of Freshwater Phytoplankton Taxa Using Metabarcoding and Microscopy	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Phytoplankton is the basis of the food web and an indicator of environmental change in aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton assessment uses microscopy, which estimates the composition, absolute abundance and biomass of taxa, and metabarcoding, which estimates the composition, high richness and diversity, and relative abundance of taxa. Problems remain with the consistency of results from these two methods and the quantification of metabarcoding. Using 18S rRNA metabarcoding and microscopy we compared the relative or absolute abundance and biomass of phytoplankton taxa (class or genus/species) in the south basin of Lake Baikal in spring over 3 years. Absolute abundance/biomass of phytoplankton taxa estimated by metabarcoding was obtained by combining relative abundances of amplicon sequence variants (ASV produced by error-correcting method) derived from the V8-V9 region of 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (primers were used that accurately represented the mean relative abundance of different microalgae) with total or class-specific abundance/biomass of phytoplankton estimated by light microscopy. Many Spearman correlations were found between relative (non- or clr-transformed) or absolute abundances/biomasses of the same phytoplankton classes or genus/species. Correlation coefficients were higher between absolute values than between relative values. Correlations were found between relative or absolute abundance/biomass, estimated by both methods, of the classes Bacillariophyceae, Coscinodiscophyceae, Mediophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Cryptophyceae, and Chlorophyceae, but not Dinophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae. Correlations were found between relative or absolute abundance/biomass of dominant species and ASVs of diatoms (Ulnaria, Aulacoseira, Stephanodiscus), Chrysophyceae (Dinobryon), and Cryptophyceae (Cryptomonas). Thus, the consistency of the dynamics of the relative or absolute abundance/biomass of phytoplankton taxa estimated by the two methods was revealed. Absolute abundances/biomasses of taxa estimated by metabarcoding in combination with microscopy improve the accuracy of metabarcoding-based ecological assessment.

Habitat characteristics and biological patterns	LAKE CHAMPLAIN: PARTNERSHIPS AND RESEARCH IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM					Spring Symposium on Lake Champlain in the New Millennium	MAY 20-23, 2002	Missisquoi Bay Watershed Corp, St Jean, CANADA	Lake Champlain Res Consortium	Missisquoi Bay Watershed Corp			Pockmarks are common features on the bottom of Lake Champlain, especially in the central part of the lake, between Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York. Pockmarks have the potential to provide a unique bottom environment for biota because of the different water quality and habitat conditions that may exist inside and outside the pockmark. In Burlington Bay, the "General" is a large pockmark, roughly 40 meters in diameter and 4 meters in depth, located in about 28 meters of water. We collected benthic invertebrate samples inside and outside the "General" pockmark, and collected sediment, pore and overlying water for analysis. We also caged zebra mussels inside and outside the pockmark to determine whether varying water quality or food availability in the pockmark would influence these mussels. The concentrations of Al, Fe, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, S, Si, and Zn in the overlying water were higher inside the pockmark than outside, with generally highest concentrations near the outside rim of the pockmark rather than at its deepest point. The benthic invertebrate density also varied among sites, with generally more invertebrates inside than outside the pockmark. Clinkers, the remains of coal combustion, were common in the sediment both inside and outside the pockmark. Although clinker density was highly variable, in general, fewer invertebrates were found where the density of clinkers was high. The zebra mussels inside the lip of the pockmark grew less, but had higher shell weight to body weight ratios than those outside the pockmark. This suggests that food might be limited by the water flow pattern in the pockmark, but these mussels were able to take advantage of additional calcium in that water. Mean calcium concentration outside was 14.23 mg/L, while inside it was 15.14 mg/L. It also suggests that zebra mussels in the broader lake may be calcium limited.					; Manley, Thomas/JGE-0411-2023	Watzin, Mary/0000-0003-2041-8546; 															0-306-48469-2				2004							331	348																WOS:000224236900018

Beebread and worker bee and samples from 71 and 51 apiaries, respectively were obtained. Beebread from the brood chamber combs were extracted aseptically from each honey bee colony as described previously) -3 Samples were stored at -80 C until further use. All honey bee worker samples were analyzed for the main pathogens related to the weakening and death of bee colonies in Spain. PCR was performed for Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae Trypanosomatids, Neogregarines, Lake Sinai Virus complex (LSV complex), and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus-Kashmir Bee Virus-Israeli Acute Paralisis Virus complex (AKI complex) Specific primers and probes for the amplification of Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) were used. A Screening analysis of chemical residues was conducted with a modified QuEChERS protocol and under ISO 17025 standard and guidance document SANCO/12571/2013 The most prevalent pathogens were Nosema ceranae (69%), Varroa destructor mite (49%), with a mean percentage of parasitization around 1.7%, and Trypanosomatids (40.7%). Neogregarines (6%), Acarapis woodi (7%) and Nosema apis (7%) were detected a lower prevalence. Of the six screening viruses, the more prevalent were BQCV (57%) and DWV (54%). LSV complex was detected in the 14% of the samples. The pesticides most commonly found in the samples were miticides typically used for Varroa mite control: coumaphos (98.6%), chlorfenvinphos (72.86%); tau-fluvalinate (70%) and secondly, carbendazim (40%) chlorpyriphos (45.71%), acrinathrin (24.9%) and imidacloprid (22.6%) were also detected. Based on these results, we discuss the suitability of different methodologies proposed in the literature to assess the effect of honey bees chronically exposed to multiple residue and nosogenic agents found in hive.

J	Aspler, LB; Chiarenzelli, JR				Aspler, LB; Chiarenzelli, JR			Initiation of similar to 2.45-2.1 Ga intracratonic basin sedimentation of the Hurwitz Group, Keewatin Hinterland, Northwest Territories, Canada	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Continental to shallow-marine rocks of the Hurwitz Group, exposed as outliers across the Hearne Province in northern Canada, were deposited between similar to 2.45 and 2.11 Ga on a 3.3-2.6 Ga granite-greenstone basement. Initiation of the Hurwitz Basin was characterized by low relief and rates of subsidence that never progressed beyond the intensity of regional sagging. During stage 1, polymictic conglomerate (lower Noomut Formation) was deposited in palaeovalleys cut into Archaean basement, and subarkose to quartz arenite +/- quartz pebble conglomerate (upper Noomut Formation) was deposited on a low-relief sand plain. Abundant first-cycle quartz-rich sandstones are attributed to intense humid climate weathering in low-relief source areas and at sites of temporary storage, as well as to repeated fluvial and eolian reworking. Interbedding of pyritic palaeoplacers and continental redbeds denotes fluctuating levels of atmospheric oxygen; disappearance of pyritic palaeoplacers upsection signifies ultimate changeover to an atmosphere with sustained free oxygen. Stage 2 (Padlei Formation) was marked by a climatic shift toward cold (glacial?) conditions as indicated by dropstones, greywacke (till?) pellets and possible ikaite pseudo-morphs in lacustrine rhythmites. Stage 3 (Kinga Formation) represents a return to wet/warm conditions with fluvial (+/- eolian) deposition of subarkose and quartz arenite on a low-relief sand plain (Maguse Member) and deposition of supermature quartz arenite in a vast (100,000 k(m)2 minimum), shallow-water lake or series of lakes (Whiterock Member). Local chert beds at the top of the Kinga Formation (Hawk Hill Member) formed by spring discharge due to regional, gravity-driven, convective groundwater flow. An intracratonic setting is implied by: (1) a symmetric, basin-centred fill; (2) absence of features indicating a shelf-slope break; (3) absence of rift rocks; (4) a prolonged slow-subsidence history; (5) likely correlation with other continental to shallow-marine deposits scattered across the Keewatin Hinterland; and (6) positioning 1000-2000 km away from closest coeval passive margin sequences. We speculate that Hurwitz Basin formed due to lithospheric stretching related to a large-scale mantle upwelling during the protracted breakup of an earliest Palaeoproterozoic supercontinent ('Kenorland').																			0301-9268					FEB	1997	81	3-4					265	297		10.1016/S0301-9268(96)00038-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0301-9268(96)00038-1													WOS:A1997XG31500006

The geodiversity of the province, which is spread over nineteen regions, is distributed from old to young within the Menderes Massif, Lycian Nappes, Oligocene Molasse, Neogene continental deposits, Neogene volcanics and Quaternary formations. The gneisses and accompanying schists of the Menderes Massif located near the Buldan District are probably among the oldest rocks in both the region and T & uuml;rkiye. The Late Triassic carbonate-evaporite nappe slice within the Lycian Nappes, emplaced during the Late Cretaceous-Eocene period, is a rare outcrop. Molasse successions filling NE-SW trending basins during the late Oligocene period, when nappe emplacements continued, are quite common in the province. In March 2024, the Oligocene molasse was designated among the First 100 Geological Heritage Sites of T & uuml;rkiye.<br /> The Neogene sedimentary fill of the Denizli Basin is unique and has different characteristics compared to other graben fills in Western Anatolia. One of these characteristics is that it contains Paratethyan mollusc fauna. The geodiversity elements of the Neogene to Quaternary period are closely related to basin fills, horst-graben structures, normal faults, extensional fractures and the extensional tectonics that gave rise to them. Particularly, canyons, caves, landslides, geothermal areas, hot springs, a wide variety of travertine formations, lakes and wetlands stand out in the geodiversity from the Quaternary. The most important lake isAc & imath;g & ouml;l, which is a closed basin. Pamukkale Travertines, the most prominent geodiversity element in Denizli, were listed among the First 100 Geological Heritage Sites of the World by the International Union of Geological Sciences.

In this work, the geochemical characterization of phosphorus (P) in the surface sediments of Edku Lagoon, Egypt, was studied in Spring 2019. Spatial variation, geochemical forms of P, and the factors affecting them were discussed. The concentrations of four operationally determined bioavailable P fractions that can be extracted from the sediments were examined. These fractions were water-soluble P (WSP, F1), readily desorbable P (RDP, F2), algae-available P (AAP, F3), and NaHCO3-extractable P (Olsen P, F4). Materials and methods Thirteen surface sediment samples were collected from Edku Lagoon, and from feeder drains. Sediment geochemical properties, total P (TP), inorganic P (IP), organic P (OP), bioavailable P fractions, and diagnostic ratios (Fe:P, S:Fe, and OC:OP) were determined. The results were discussed through various statistical analyses. Results and discussion The ranges and relative percentages of these P forms of the total concentration in the lagoon sediment stations examined were in the following order: AAP (16.7-35.4; 25.7 +/- 6.65%) > Olsen P (9.1-13.8; 11.3 +/- 1.74%) > WSP (2.7-8.2; 6.0 +/- 1.96%) > RDP (0.41-1.26; 0.89 +/- 0.32%). The results showed that IP was the main form of TP in the sediments; its concentration was six times that of OP. The relative IP to TP ratio ranged between 69 and 98%, whereas OP accounted for 2-31% of TP. The sediments of Edku Lagoon were characterized by relatively large amounts of bioavailable P; the sum of P fractions exceeded 40% of the TP. The severe increase in AAP indicated very abundant vegetation. The diagnostic ratios (Fe:P, S:Fe, and OC:OP) were calculated. Most stations had Fe:P < 15 (high P internal loading). However, 85% of the studied sediment samples had S:Fe < 1.5 ratios, which showed high sediment potency to isolate Fe-associated P forms. The high OC:OP ratio along the studied lagoon and drains reflected the hypertrophic conditions and foreign input sources of organic carbon. Conclusions The results reflected the ability of the studied P fractions to release easily from the lagoon sediments, which contributes greatly to the abundance of P from the sediments and its ease of access to surface waters, and therefore the sediments must be dredged in Edku Lagoon. The information collected will be useful in the management and development of the examined lagoon.

Using the ROTAN model to predict nitrogen loads to Lake Rotorua, New Zealand	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc (Aust MS), Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM), Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI), Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian (ESA), HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI), Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ), Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)				Nitrogen limits phytoplankton growth in several lakes in the central volcanic plateau, North Island, New Zealand. Since the 1940-1950s the intensification of livestock farming has increased nitrogen exports from pasture and contributed to deterioration in lake water quality. These changes went undetected for many years because much of the nitrate exported from pasture is transported to the lakes via deep aquifers with mean residence times (MRTs) of decades to over a century. However, increasing trends are now apparent in stream nitrogen concentrations, and modelling is being undertaken to help managers decide how best to reduce lake loads. Morgenstern et al. (2005) measured tritium tracer concentrations in springs, wells and groundwater-fed streams in the Lake Rotorua catchment. They used these data along with measured nitrogen loads to the lake, to fit a combined exponential-piston flow model (EPM) to describe the groundwater system of the Lake Rotorua catchment. This fitting involved obtaining the MRTs and the fractions of plug flow and mixed (or exponential) flow in the EPM model for the groundwater emerging in the nine major streams that flow into Lake Rotorua. Assuming an average flow for each of the streams and a constant nitrogen export from the land that started in 1950, Morgenstern and Gordon (2006) used the EPM model to predict the nitrate load to the lake for 2005 and into the future (which included a steady state load). The ROTAN model (Rutherford et al., 2011) simulates land use, aquifers, springs, streams and total nitrogen input to the lake from 1900-2100 using a daily or weekly time step. Nitrogen exports are estimated using the OVERSEER (R) model (http://www.overseer.org.nz), combined with historic land use maps and agricultural statistics. It uses the mean residence times estimated by Morgenstern et al. (2005) to size the aquifers. ROTAN has been calibrated using stream and nitrogen concentration data from the nine major streams that flow into Lake Rotorua. Morgenstern et al. (2005) assumed that all of the nitrogen reached the lake via the same aquifer, whereas with ROTAN the best fit to stream flow and nitrogen concentration data was obtained by assuming that the average proportion of nitrogen reaching the lake via the deep groundwater was 53%, and the remaining 47% reached the lake via shallow groundwater and near-surface flow. ROTAN accounts for historical land use and therefore the nitrogen export from the land varies temporally unlike the exports in the EPM model of Morgenstern which are constant either side of the step change in exports in 1950 or 1965. This paper explores the effect that differences between the two models have on estimating both the current load, and future loads to the lake when different land use and mitigation measures are modelled. The ROTAN model, for example, found that if the total nitrogen export remains at the current (2010) level, the lake load is likely to increase slowly over the next 60-70 years and to approach a steady state of 724 tN/yr by about 2080. ROTAN simulations also indicate that if total nitrogen exports were reduced by 320-350 tN/yr in 2015 and held constant, then the lake load is likely to decrease fairly quickly and approach the lake load target of 405 tN/yr within about 35 years. This response time is faster than expected and this paper describes the use of the Morgenstern model as an independent check on the ROTAN result to see if it obtains a similar response time. The loads predicted by the two models do not match particularly well from 1940-2015 and this gives less confidence in comparing them. However, after 2015 they predict similar loads with the Morgenstern model calculating that it will take about 45 years for the lake load target to be reached. This response time is longer than ROTAN's one of 35 years, but is sufficiently similar to give confidence in ROTAN's result.																					978-0-9872143-1-7				2011							2367	2373																WOS:000314989302051

Dramatic local environmental change during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum detected using high resolution chemical analyses of Green River Formation stromatolites	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Eocene Green River Formation represents a system of lakes that covered parts of what is now Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, and captures the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, 52-50 million years ago or Ma), the warmest period of the Cenozoic Era, and a period associated with very high levels of atmospheric CO2. Lakes, especially closed basin lakes, can respond dramatically to environmental change because of their sensitivity to precipitation and evaporation. In this study, stromatolites from the Rife Bed of the Green River Formation are used as fine-scale records of terrestrial paleoenvironmental change during a global hothouse climate, and to investigate how the environmental dynamics within the lake system affected the growth of stromatolites. The stromatolites are composed of branching microdigitate columns laminated on the 10-100 mu m scale. Laminae are grouped in cm-scale layers that alternate between calcite fan, micritic, and mixed microstructures. The fan layers are depleted in O-18, Na, and Mg/Ca. The micrite layers, in contrast, are comparatively enriched in O-18, Na, and Mg/Ca. The delta C-13 and delta O-18 are strongly positively correlated, suggesting the stromatolites formed in a closed basin lake, consistent with the regional stratigraphy. Additionally, clumped isotope analyses provide the first quantitative values for water temperatures in lake water from the Green River Formation (similar to 35 degrees C for micrite layers and similar to 28 degrees C for fan layers). Changes in delta O-18 and sodium ion concentration are likely related to periods of evaporation and recharge, and thus can be used to estimate lake volume change during stromatolite growth. Two models, one using sodium ion concentrations in a conserved system, the other using Rayleigh fractionation and mixing equations to explain changes in oxygen isotopes, converge upon similar results for lake volume changes, revealing multiple episodes of meter-scale lake level rise and fall during the accretion of the similar to 30 cm thick stromatolite. Because of the broad, flat bathymetry of the lake, such lake volume and depth changes would have been accompanied by shoreline shifts on the order of tens of kilometers while the stromatolites were actively growing, challenging the view of a single stromatolite paleoenvironment in the lake. Therefore, the fan microfabric, interpreted here as abiogenic in nature, formed in cooler waters when the lake was deeper, possibly below a thermocline. In contrast, the micrite microfabric, for which there is evidence of biogenicity, formed when the lake was shallow and warm. The alternation between biogenic and abiogenic microfabrics present in the Rife Bed stromatolites is hypothesized to result from dramatic changes in lake level influencing the microbiology and chemistry of the waters in which the stromatolites formed, indicating that stromatolite growth can occur under disparate conditions and therefore does not necessarily represent a single facies.

Between 1992 and 1995 a detailed study of H-3-He-3 ages was conducted in Lake Baikal, the deepest and largest lake by volume on Earth, to investigate deep water renewal in its three major basins. Maximum H-3-He-3 ages are 14-17 years in the southern basin, 16-18 years in the central basin, and 10-11 years in the northern basin. Rates of renewal of deep water with surface water, deduced from volume-weighted mean H-3-He-3 ages below 250 m depth, are about 10% yr(-1) in the southern and central basins and 15% yr(-1) in the northern basin. In the southern basin the mean H-3-He-3 age below 250 m depth increased steadily from 9.6 years in 1992 to 11 years in 1995, indicating a slight diminution in deep water renewal during this time. Bottom water renewal by large-scale advection was estimated from the mass balance of He-3 in the 200 m thick bottom layer of each basin. Bottom water renewal rates in the northern basin were found to be between 80 and 150 km(3) yr(-1) and in the central basin between 10 and 20 km(3) yr(-1), whereas in the southern basin they were practically zero. Correlating oxygen and dissolved helium-4 concentrations with H-3-He-3 age allowed us to determine the mean hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rate in the water column (4.5 mu mol L-1 yr(-1)), as well as mean helium fluxes from the lake bottom (2.8x10(11) atoms m(-2) s(-1) in the northern basin, and 1.3x10(11) atoms m(-2) s(-1) in the central and southern basins). The helium isotope ratio of the terrigenic helium component injected from the lake bottom, determined from measurements of water from hydrothermal springs in the vicinity of the lake, was found to be similar to 2.2 x 10(-7).																			2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN 15	1998	103	C6					12823	12838		10.1029/97JC02218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JC02218													WOS:000074160900017
J	Liu, H; Yang, H; Cao, YN; Leng, Q; Liu, WG				Liu, Hu; Yang, Hong; Cao, Yunning; Leng, Qin; Liu, Weiguo			Inter-molecular variations of fatty acid δD in algae and submerged plants from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta D) of fatty acids (FAs) in lake sediments have been widely used in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, but investigations on FA delta D values in algae and submerged plants from natural lakes are still limited, greatly hampering the application and interpretation of their delta D values in lacustrine environments. Here, we systematically investigated delta D values of short-chain (C-14-C-18), mid-chain (C-20-C-24), and long-chain (C-26-C-30) FAs in four algae and submerged macrophytes, two algal genera Chara and Cladophora and two angiosperm genera Potamogeton and Ruppia, that commonly occur in six lakes on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. We obtained the following results: (i) C-20-C-30 FAs in each algal and submerged plant sample have similar variation patterns in delta D values, suggesting that delta D values of C-20-C-30 FAs have consistent responses to their source water delta D. In C-4-like taxa (Potamogeton, Ruppia, and Chara), the C-16 and C-26 FAs have minor differences in their delta D values, while in the C-3-like Cladophora, delta D values of C-16 FAs are significantly more negative (avg. -48 +/- 7 parts per thousand) than that of the C-26 FAs. We propose that different photosynthetic mechanisms in these algae and submerged plants account for the different inter-molecular delta D variations between C-16 and C-26 FAs; (ii) delta D values of C-26 FAs in the carbonate-coated alga Chara are significantly correlated with the delta O-18 values of carbonate encrustations - such a co-variance suggests that in addition to lake water, other factors may also influence both lipid synthesis and carbonate encrustation building up in Chara, leading to a significantly positive apparent hydrogen isotope fractionation factors (epsilon(FA-W)) between C-26 FAs of Chara and lake water; (iii) delta D values of C-26 FAs from Potamogeton, Ruppia and Cladophora are correlated well with lake water delta D values (R-2 = 0.84, p < 0.001, n = 19), suggesting that the delta D values of long-chain FAs potentially record delta D variations of lake water with the apparent hydrogen isotope fractionation factors (epsilon(FA-W)) of C-26 FAs ranging from -153 parts per thousand to -134 parts per thousand.

TREATING FLOODPLAIN LAKES OF LARGE RIVERS AS STUDY UNITS FOR VARIABLES THAT VARY WITHIN LAKES; AN EVALUATION USING CHLOROPHYLL A AND INORGANIC SUSPENDED SOLIDS DATA FROM FLOODPLAIN LAKES OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Contiguous floodplain lakes (lakes') have historically been used as study units for comparative studies of limnological variables that vary within lakes. The hierarchical nature of these studies implies that study variables may be correlated within lakes and that covariate associations may differ not only among lakes but also by spatial scale. We evaluated the utility of treating lakes as study units for limnological variables that vary within lakes based on the criteria of important levels of among-lake variation in study variables and the observation of covariate associations that vary among lakes. These concerns were selected, respectively, to ensure that lake signatures were distinguishable from within-lake variation and that lake-scale effects on covariate associations might provide inferences not available by ignoring those effects. Study data represented chlorophyll a (CHL) and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) data from lakes within three reaches of the Upper Mississippi River. Sampling occurred in summer from 1993 through 2005 (except 2003); numbers of lakes per reach varied from 7 to 19, and median lake area varied from 53 to 101ha. CHL and ISS levels were modelled linearly, with lake, year and lakexyear effects treated as random. For all reaches, the proportions of variation in CHL and ISS attributable to differences among lakes (including lake and lakexyear effects) were substantial (range: 18%73%). Finally, among-lake variation in CHL and ISS was strongly associated with covariates and covariate effects that varied by lakes or lake-years (including with vegetation levels and, for CHL, log(ISS)). These findings demonstrate the utility of treating floodplain lakes as study units for the study of limnological variables and the importance of addressing hierarchy within study designs when making inferences from data collected within floodplain lakes.

Bimineralic calcite-aragonite rafts in the hypogeous lakes of Cova dets Ases (Mallorca): Controls on precipitation and polymorphism	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Calcite-aragonite bimineralic rafts and related waters from hypogenic lakes in the coastal cave of "Cova dets Ases", Mallorca, have been analyzed for mineralogy and geochemistry (including stable isotopes). The main objective has been the evaluation of the factors that control the chemical and mineralogical composition of the precipitates as they are another natural example of the classical problem of aragonite vs calcite precipitation. The hydrochemistry of the lakes in these coastal caves is mainly conditioned by the mixture of fresh and marine waters. The percentage of mixing, together with the CO2 degasification from the lakes water, seems to play a fundamental role in the precipitation of the carbonate rafts. However, their presence in the studied lakes does not show a homogeneous distribution in space and time and no clear relation has been found between that distribution and the evolution of any of the monitored environmental variables. With respect to their mineralogy, the main factor that seems to control the dominant bimineralic composition of the rafts studied here is the Mg/Ca ratio in the waters, which means the percentage of marine component in those waters. The variations of this ratio, in combination with changes in the degasification rate and in the oversaturation with respect to calcite and aragonite will condition the presence of one or the other polymorph. Even small microenvironmental variations seem to affect the order of precipitation of these bimineralic rafts. Another important issue in this work is that the data obtained in this natural system have been used to check the most suitable delta 18O isotope fractionation equations for the paleotemperature calculations from rafts precipitated in the past under similar conditions.

GEOCHEMISTRY OF GROUNDWATERS AND SURFACE WATERS, AND GROUND ICE OF THE OKA PLATEAU, EASTERN SAYAN (RUSSIA)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												The study area is located in the Eastern Sayan hydrogeological folded area. The objects of the study were groundwaters, surface waters and ground ice in the Sentsa River basin on the Oka Plateau. Cold and thermal groundwaters are associated with Proterozoic and Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks. Their discharge as springs occurs in the river valleys along fault zones. Ground ice was studied in mineral frost mounds (lithalsas) composed of clays, clayey silts and silts of lacustrine-alluvial and fluvioglacial genesis. It has been established that thermal and cold groundwaters have HCO3 Ca-Na compositions, river and lake waters, as a rule, have HCO3 Ca-Na compositions, and ground ice melts - HCO3, SO4-HCO3 and NH4-HCO3 Ca. Thermal waters are largely enriched in Li, Be, B, Si, Mn, Ga, Ge, Se, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba and all REE relative to river and rain waters, and have the highest values of trace elements enrichment factor (EFREE). The latter shows that atmospheric precipitation participates in the formation of the composition of groundwaters (cold and thermal) and surface waters. The specificity of the geochemistry of ground ice is determined by the composition of precipitation, the injection of ice-forming groundwater from taliks, the interaction in the water-rock system, and the presence of organic matter in unconsolidated sediments. The participation of river water and groundwater in the formation of the frost mound ice core is also evidenced by similar values of stable isotopes (delta 18O, delta D) in surface water, groundwater and ground ice. The 3He/4He ratio points to a possible influx of mantle helium into thermal waters, and delta 13 & Scy; points to the magmatic and thermometamorphic mechanisms of carbon dioxide accumulation in thermal waters. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio in travertines indicates a significant contribution of intrusive rocks to the formation of fluid composition.

Environmental shifts and CaCO3 variations in the sediment record of a dome-shaped alkaline fen in NE Poland: unravelling the timing and drivers of tufa onset, peak and decline	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The growing interest in palaeoenvironmental studies of CaCO3-depositing alkaline fens is improving our understanding of these ecosystems' long-term evolution. However, disentangling the local and regional drivers behind environmental shifts on multi-decadal to centennial timescales remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate the sediment record of one of the most distinctive dome-shaped CaCO3-depositing alkaline fens in CE Europe, located in Makowlany-Sidra, northeastern Poland, to reconstruct tufa accumulation dynamics and associated shifts in plant and snail compositions. Our approach combines geochemical methods, palaeobiological analyses and radiocarbon dating of plant macrofossils from two sediment cores. We report the onset of tufa formation around 12300 cal yr BP, which is exceptionally early given the fen's location in the northern part of CE Europe. This early start of tufa accumulation is attributed to exceptionally early permafrost thaw, facilitated by the fen's location on the flood plain. The most intensive CaCO3 deposition occurred between 10700 and 7300 cal yr BP, with cessation occurring around 2700 cal yr BP. These transitions in the CaCO3 record were accompanied by shifts in plant and snail compositions, highlighting the importance of substratum composition in shaping these ecosystems. We have distinguished the different stages of fen development and dome formation considering their spatial and temporal variability. In addition, we captured evidence of the redirection of ascending groundwater flow that took place over the course of the dome development. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into the interplay between climate, hydrology and vegetation in the long-term evolution of alkaline fens. As such, it contributes new perspectives to discussions on the long-term evolution and conservation of calcareous fens under changing climate regimes.

The pondweed has been found widely in many lakes in northern China. The Dongping Lake is a typical shallow macrophytic lake in north China, and it is an important junction at the East Route Project of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (ERP-CSNWDP). In mid-summer, the pondweed die-offs result in a critical loss of dissolved oxygen and decaying plants can result in Dongping Lake eutrophication, blocked waterway, and fish kills. In order to maintain the environment security of the ERP-CSNWDP, there is an urgent need to understand the spatial and temporal changes of pondweed's rapid range expansion in Dongping Lake. We employed moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, normalized difference vegetation index data, and field investigations to extract its phenological characteristic. Landsat images from pondweed blooming and decay phases were acquired for eight representative growth stage years during the period of 1985-2017 to extract pondweed distribution. Through the validation, there was an accuracy of more than 89% for pondweed extraction in 2017. Then, we used a dimidiate pixel model to calculate its fractional green vegetation coverage (FVC). The results illustrated that its range expanded continuously during the 32-year study period. Its habitat changed from the scattered near shore distribution in 1985 to the contiguous coverage of large areas of the lake surface in 2017. The range expansion of pondweed was grouped into three stages. From 1985 to 1996, it had a slow growth stage with a maximum species range of 10.34 km(2) in Dongping Lake. During the period of 1996-2001, there was an explosive growth stage during which it become the dominant species in the Lake. From 2001 to 2017, the range continued to increase to 49.07 km(2), which comprised 40% of the surface area of the Lake. By spearman rank correlation analysis, we found that there was a significant correlation between pondweed area and the lake eutrophication level (R = 0.79, P < 0.05). The FVC spatial pattern after 2001 exhibited a gradual horizontal decrease from the southeast to the northwest of Dongping Lake. This study illustrates the application of vegetation phenology to assess the spatial and temporal pattern of pondweed. The opening of the ERP-CSNWDP is diverting a fraction of the total flow of the Yangtze River to Northern China via the Dongping Lake and presents an ongoing environmental security risk which will require future pondweed invasive species control and mitigation strategies utilizing ground and satellite-based spectrum observations.

J	CYRUS, DP				CYRUS, DP			THE BIOLOGY OF SOLEA-BLEEKERI (TELEOSTEI) IN LAKE ST-LUCIA ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF AFRICA	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH					1ST INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON FLATFISH ECOLOGY	NOV 19-23, 1990	TEXEL, NETHERLANDS	NETHERLANDS INST SEA RES, NETHERLANDS INST FISHERY INVESTIGAT, COMMODITY BOARD FISH & FISHERY PROD, ROYAL NETHERLANDS ACAD ARTS & SCI				Several aspects of the biology of Solea bleekeri in Lake St Lucia were investigated, these included occurrence, distribution, reproduction and recruitment, food and feeding, size frequency distribution and the role of estuaries in the species' life cycle. Solea bleekeri was found to occur throughout the system in muddy turbid areas and was largely absent from the eastern shores of the lake where clear water sandy substrata occur. The preferred diet of the species was bivalve siphon tips of the species Solon cylindraceus, when these were in abundant supply. However, when numbers of large (length > 20 mm) specimens were not available then S. bleekeri fed on whatever prey was available in or near the substratum. Analysis of stomach contents under the latter conditions showed that food consumption reflected the composition of the benthos. Large numbers of S. bleekeri spend their entire postlarval and juvenile phases as well as the greater part of their adult life within estuaries. Evidence is presented to support the idea that S. bleekeri breeds in certain areas of the lake and that spawning takes place between September and November. The current data suggest that there may be two populations in St Lucia: one migrates from the system to spawn at sea during winter along with the other marine fish species which utilize estuaries as nursery areas, while the other population breeds within the system. Alternatively there may simply be a single population which normally breeds at sea, but which may breed within the system when conditions are suitable. Recruitment of S. bleekeri into the St Lucia estuarine system takes place from the muddy offshore marine banks and possibly from within the system as well. Solea bleekeri appears not to be totally dependent on estuaries for the completion of its life cycle. The advantages of utilizing these systems for their development relate to the shallow, calm, turbid food-rich areas which estuaries offer. The fact that breeding takes place within St Lucia means that adults and juveniles are present in varying numbers throughout the year.																			0077-7579					JUL	1991	27	3-4					209	216		10.1016/0077-7579(91)90025-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(91)90025-V													WOS:A1991GB83600003

ROLE OF THE STRUCTURAL FACTOR IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIGH-RADON GROUNDWATER IN THE SOUTHWESTERN FLANK OF THE SOUTH BAIKAL RIFT BASIN	GEODYNAMICS & TECTONOPHYSICS												This article discusses the distribution patterns of high-radon groundwater at the southwestern shore of Lake Baikal. This region is a flank of the South Baikal rift basin, characterized by high geodynamic activity and complex fault patterns, without any special geochemical conditions with regard to the content of uranium in the rocks. Based on our observations and measurements, we consolidated the first massive database on radon volume activity (Q) in a variety of local water sources. In the Kultuk-Vydrino area, the Q values vary from zero to 81.1 Bq/l, according to the analysis of the water samples from 93 springs, lakes, small streams, wells, and drilled holes. The highest concentrations of radon are discovered in the groundwater samples. Such values are unevenly scattered across the study area. The chain of the maximum Q values trends northwestwards along the Lake Baikal shore. This distribution pattern of radon, as well as the locations of individual water sources with Q>15 Bq/l are predetermined by the structural factor. The paragenetic analysis of faults and joints in the Kultuk-Vydrino area shows that this factor includes both the structure and stages in the development of the regional largest Main Sayan fault zone (the southwestern flank of the South Baikal basin is a segment of this zone). The water sources with increased concentrations of radon are located in zones with a high density of the 2nd order faults, especially on sites wherein the NW-striking faults cross the transverse faults that have experienced repeated activation. Temperature T is an additional factor influencing the degree of radioactivity in water. A relationship between T and Q is reverse. Water sources with Q>15 Bq/l associated with the 2nd order fault zones may occur also due to a locally lower temperature of groundwater. Our study gives evidence that the southwestern coast of Lake Baikal is promising for finding high-radon water sources. Using such water in balneology can become a valuable contribution to the tourism and recreational potential of the region. This prospect is especially important for the town of Baikalsk that is now developing without its township-forming enterprise: the notorious pulp-and-paper mill has been completely shut down.

This characterisation is based on geophysical (heat-flow), tectonic, hydrological, hydrochemical (major elements, stable isotopes) and sedimentological (seismic profiles, core mineralogy) studies of data acquired from 1990 to 1994 during the CASIMIR project (Comparative Analysis of Sedimentary Infill Mechanisms in Rifts). Sub-surface activity is expressed through seismic and volcanic activity, as well as elevated heat-flow values, both beneath the lake and the surrounding area; hydrothermal activity is observed in the watershed however it was not clearly identified in the sub-lacustrine environment. Relatively high heat-flow values (80-90 mW/m(2)) and the chemical composition of hydrothermal fluids in hot springs suggest the presence of a magmatic body at depth. The influence of Quaternary tectonic activity on sedimentary dynamics and infilling is observed not only on land but also in the lake through high-resolution seismic profiles. The main feature is a general tilting of the Kyela Plain as shown by a shift in the river course. The Quaternary stacking pattern of seven sedimentary sequences identified on a grid of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles represents a complete long-term lake-level cycle, from a lake lowstand at about 320 m below the present level to the present-day lake high-stand. The North-Kiwira and Songwe River delta systems, composed of a number of stacked lobes, were developed in response to the interplay between gradual lake-level rise, tectonic movement and sediment input. The river dynamics is also recorded in a short core by a mineralogical evolution probably due to a decrease of detrital inputs from the Songwe River in response to hydroclimatic changes. Such changes are very important as this northern part of the watershed is considered as a recharge zone for the entire take. Sedimentological patterns (from shallow depth to about 240 m water depth) and hydrochemistry are both influenced by watershed characteristics (pedology, geology, vegetation, hydrology, climate, etc.) but also by lacustrine biological processes: diatom productivity in epilimnetic water and degradation or preservation in deeper waters.
